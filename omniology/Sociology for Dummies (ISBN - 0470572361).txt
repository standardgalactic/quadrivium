About the Author
Jay Gabler is a writer, editor, and college teacher living in Minneapolis. He 
holds a bachelor’s degree from Boston University and graduate degrees, 
including a Ph.D. in sociology, from Harvard University. With colleagues, 
he has published multiple sociological research studies including the book 
Reconstructing the University (with David John Frank, Stanford University 
Press, 2006). He currently teaches sociology, psychology, and education at 
Rasmussen College. He is also associate editor of the Twin Cities Daily Planet, 
where he writes regularly on the arts, and author of the most recent edition 
of the Insiders’ Guide to the Twin Cities (Globe Pequot Press, 2010).


Dedication
To David John Frank and Jason Kaufman, my mentors in sociology.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I owe gratitude to Susan Hobbs and Erin Calligan Mooney, my editors at 
Wiley, for everything they’ve done to make this book a reality. Jennifer 
Connolly also contributed signifi cantly to the fi rst chapters of this book, with 
helpful editing and suggestions.
My professional training in sociology took place over the course of a decade 
at Harvard University; every page in this book benefi ts indirectly from the 
insights and expertise of my then-colleagues in the Department of Sociology. 
My Harvard classmate Felix Elwert was instrumental in suggesting that I write 
this book and connecting me with the publisher. My current colleagues at 
Rasmussen College have also been supportive, as have my coworkers at the 
Twin Cities Daily Planet. Much of this book was written at the Macalester 
College library, and I am grateful to that institution for sharing its resources.
This book is informed by a range of sources, three of which were particularly 
useful. Randall Collins’s Sociological Insight, as I mention frequently in the 
text of this book, was my personal introduction to sociology, and it contin-
ues to underlie my perspective on the discipline. I recommend that book 
in Chapter 17. A book that I would not recommend to beginners but would 
strongly recommend to readers interested in really sinking their teeth into 
sociological theory is Peter Knapp’s One World – Many Worlds: Contemporary 
Sociological Theory, which particularly informed Chapter 3 of this book. 
Essentials of Sociology, by David B. Brinkerhoff, Lynn K. White, Suzanne T. 
Ortega, and Rose Weitz, is the text I teach from at Rasmussen and was also 
helpful as I wrote this book.
Throughout my life I’ve enjoyed the enthusiastic support of a loving family, 
both immediate and extended. In particular, my parents, Jim and Jean Gabler, 
have in every way supported my academic achievements and adventures. As 
I wrote this book, many friends — in particular, Anna Meyer — helped sus-
tain me with caring encouragement every day. It meant a lot to me.

Introduction
W
elcome to sociology! I’ve written this book to introduce you to one of 
the biggest and most fascinating disciplines in all of science. Yes, you 
read that right: Sociology is a science. Sociologists don’t use beakers and test 
tubes, but like natural scientists, they do seek to learn about the world by 
creating theories and testing them with systematic observations.
What makes sociology both so interesting and so challenging is its subject: 
the social world. Society is huge, and hugely complex: there are answers to 
sociological questions, but there usually aren’t any easy answers. In addition 
to the challenge of answering sociological questions, there’s the challenge of 
asking them — that is, of thinking about society as a subject of objective, sci-
entific study. Your grandpa and your minister and the guy who works at your 
local coffee shop probably don’t have any opinions about how atoms should 
and shouldn’t bond with one another, but they certainly all have opinions 
about how society should be organized. Studying society scientifically means 
setting aside — temporarily — your thoughts about how society should work.
After you do that, though, you can learn some amazing things about the 
world. The achievements of sociologists are among the great achievements 
of the human race because in sociology, people from all different walks of life 
come together to understand society objectively — so that, in the long run, 
it can perhaps be made to work better for everyone. However you’ve come 
to sociology, I hope this book leaves you with a greater respect not just for 
sociologists wearing lab coats (yes, some of them actually do) but for your 
entire species, the first species on Earth capable of conscious self-analysis. 
What sociologists see when they look at society isn’t always pretty, but that 
fact makes sociology all the more important: Just like you need to know how 
a car works before you can fix it, you need to understand how society works 
before you can change it.
About This Book
I’ve written this book to introduce you to sociology as a body of knowledge 
about society, but much more importantly to introduce you to sociology as a 
way of thinking about the world.

2
Sociology For Dummies 
With a subject as vast and as frequently-changing as human society, it 
would be foolish to try to write a “user’s manual” — it would be outdated 
before the ink was dry. If this book makes you curious about a specific 
aspect of society — say, the job market in the United States or the changing 
class system — that’s great. Your local library and the Internet are full of 
specific studies on these subjects, written by sociologists and other schol-
ars, and I hope this book makes that information more accessible to you.
What I aim to do in this book is to introduce you to sociology as a discipline 
so you have the tools and understanding you need to succeed in a sociology 
class or to apply sociological concepts in your professional or personal life. 
The book is organized to take you from general questions (what is sociology? 
where did it come from? who does it, and how?) to more specific topics (how 
do sociologists study culture and socialization? how do sociologists define 
“class” and “race”?) to applications of those ideas (how can you use sociol-
ogy in your everyday life?).
Sociologists study a lot of things — in fact, they study just about everything 
that has anything to do with people interacting — which means that most 
things studied by sociologists are also studied by people who don’t consider 
themselves sociologists. What is special about sociology is precisely the fact 
that it involves the study of all those things together, not just some of them 
in isolation. The fact that sociologists consider all aspects of the social world 
together means that they are able to see connections that people who study 
only part of the social world cannot. Throughout this book, I emphasize what 
is unique about the sociological view of the world.
Conventions Used in This Book
Obviously, I can’t possibly know each and every person who reads this book, 
but I can reasonably guess that you’re living in the early 21st century, that 
you have some reason for being curious about sociology, and that you’re 
likely — but not necessarily — living in an English-speaking country. I have 
not written this book under any further assumptions about who you might be 
or why you might be reading it.
I’ve drawn examples and illustrations from a wide array of social situations, 
but you may notice that there are especially frequent examples from the 
contemporary United States. In part that’s because it’s where I live, so that’s 
what I know best. I’ve written the book in the first person, and often refer to 

3
 Introduction
my own life and personal history. Sociology is an objective science, but any 
given sociologist is a particular person with a unique set of interests and 
experiences; I hope that as you read this book and see how sociological con-
cepts relate to my life, you’ll think about how they relate to your life, too.
I explain terms as I go, so I let you plunge right in without taking too much 
space going into specifics here in the introduction, but there are a couple of 
distinctions it may be helpful to mention right here at the outset.
For one, there’s the distinction between society and sociology. They’re not the 
same thing. Society is what sociologists study; sociology is the study of society. 
The term “social” refers to society, people interacting in groups; the term 
“sociological” refers to sociology, the study of people interacting in groups. 
If this seems confusing to you, you’re not alone: Right on up to the New York 
Times, writers often make the mistake of using the term “sociological” when 
they ought to use the term “social.” If there is increasing crime in your com-
munity, that is a social problem, not a “sociological” problem. If you’re trying 
to study that crime rises but are having a problem with missing data, then 
you have a genuinely sociological problem.
Also — to get a little ahead of myself and preview something I explain more 
in Chapter 2 — you should know that sociology is not just something that 
happens in colleges and universities. Sociology is a way of looking at the 
social world and a tool to use in understanding society; but it’s also an aca-
demic discipline, and most people who actually call themselves “sociolo-
gists” work at colleges, universities, and research institutes. Chances are 
good that you’re reading this book because you’re taking — or are thinking 
about taking — a sociology class in high school or college; but if you’re not, 
don’t stop reading! This book is for you, too. You’ll find all kinds of informa-
tion that may help you understand your place of business, your neighbor-
hood, your city, and even some of your family members!
Sociology is Controversial: 
Brace Yourself!
As I mention earlier, sociology is the study of the entire social world. That 
means that among the subjects studied by sociologists are some very con-
troversial subjects. If sociologists avoided controversial subjects, that would 
defeat the whole point of the discipline; and the same goes for this book.

4
Sociology For Dummies 
It’s part of a sociologist’s job to deal with hot topics, and some sociologists 
have made highly controversial arguments. In delving into sociology, you 
need to be prepared to encounter some ideas that you may disagree — may 
very strongly disagree — with. Among the ideas you’ll encounter in this book:
 
✓ Religion is a way of getting people to give you money, and serves no 
other constructive purpose.
 
✓ The most effective kind of government is a dictatorship where the smart-
est person rules.
 
✓ Society works best when women stay home to cook and clean while men 
go out and earn money.
You don’t need to agree with all of those arguments — I certainly don’t — to 
study sociology, but you do need to be willing to consider arguments that you 
don’t agree with. If you don’t agree with one or more of those statements, 
why don’t you? Each of the statements above makes an empirical argument. 
That means that those statements can be tested with objective facts. How 
could you test them? What data would you gather? How would you analyze 
those data? If you think the truth is not reflected in those statements, how 
can you prove it? That willingness to think about the social world as a scien-
tist — that is, objectively — is the very foundation of sociology.
I am 100 percent certain that in this book, you will encounter ideas and argu-
ments you don’t agree with. When you come across something you don’t 
agree with, think about why you don’t agree with it and what you would say 
in a debate with the people who advanced that idea. That’s how to think like 
a sociologist.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts. In this section, I explain what content 
you’ll find in each part.
Part I: The Basic Basics
This part gives you the what/who/how: what sociology is (the scientific 
study of society), where it came from (the tumultuous 19th century), who 
does it (sociologists in academia as well as people outside academia who 
can benefit from its tools and insights), and how it’s done (with a range of 
complementary methods, none of which are perfect but all of which have 
value). Reading this part will help you wrap your mind around what this 
thing called “sociology” really is.

5
 Introduction
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist
No matter what aspect of social life you’re interested in, there are some key 
sociological insights that will help you on your way. In this part, I explain 
how sociologists understand culture (what it is, and what it’s not), the micro-
macro link (what does “society” have to do with individual people interacting 
face to face), and the importance of social networks (what’s the difference 
between your “society” and the people you actually know and interact with?). 
These fundamental insights are of value across all of sociology.
Part III: Divided — er, United — We 
Stand: Equality and Inequality in 
Our Diverse World
Just about everyone who studies society is in some way or another con-
cerned about social inequality. Inequality doesn’t have to mean stratifica-
tion — that is, just because two people are different doesn’t mean one is in 
a better or more powerful position than the other — but very often, it does. 
This part is devoted to that subject in all its various forms. I begin by explain-
ing the general idea of social stratification (who’s up, who’s down?), then I go 
into some of the specific lines that divide social groups: race, ethnicity, sex, 
gender, religion, and the law (in the sense of being on “the wrong side” or 
“the right side” of the law).
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and 
Outs of Social Organization
People are always interacting, all the time — but as any parent of young 
children knows, “interacting” is not necessarily the same thing as “being pro-
ductive.” Corporations, nonprofit organizations, governments, social move-
ments, and other social organizations represent people’s deliberate attempts 
to band together to accomplish tasks, and in this part I explain what sociolo-
gists know about when those attempts work and when they don’t. Cities are a 
slightly different form of social organization, but people who live together in 
a city are together in a social organization whether they like it or not; at the 
conclusion of this part, I look at urban (as well as suburban and exurban) life.

Part V: Sociology and Your Life
Your life is inextricably tied to your society — the life you’ve lived, the life 
you’re living, and the life you will live. Understanding society can help you 
understand your own life. In this part, I first explain how sociologists think 
about individuals’ life courses (including childhood, old age, health, and 
family life) and then look at what sociology can tell us about life in the future.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This final part contains three chapters that get very specific: What inter-
esting and readable sociology books are out there besides this one? How 
can you use sociology in your everyday life? The book concludes with the 
chapter that was my favorite to write: “Ten Myths About Society Busted By 
Sociology.” Flip to that chapter to see how sociological insight will change 
the way you think about the social world around you.

Where To Go From Here
Like all Dummies books, this book is written to be modular — meaning that 
each part can stand alone. So if you look through the table of contents and 
see something you’re particularly curious about, feel free to head straight to 
that section. That said, I’ve organized the book to lead you through sociology 
from beginning concepts to specific topics, so if you’re pretty sure you’ll be 
looking at the whole book, your best bet is to start at the beginning and read 
your way through.
I’d also recommend flipping through and glancing at some of the text boxes. 
They provide concrete examples of the material discussed in the main body 
of the text, so if you feel like things are getting too theoretical or abstract, 
look to the text boxes for down-to-earth illustrations of what’s being dis-
cussed. Have fun!

W
hat is sociology? It’s not a term that usually comes 
up during dinner-table conversation, and most 
people have only a vague idea of what it’s all about. By the 
end of this part, you’ll know what sociology is, where it 
comes from, what sociologists do, why they do it, and 
how they do it. 

Chapter 1
Sociology: Getting Your 
Head Around It
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding sociology
▶ Seeing the world as a sociologist
▶ Understanding differences among people and groups
▶ Looking at social organization
▶ Appreciating your own sociological insights 
You may be holding this book because you’re enrolled in a sociology 
course in college or high school, or are thinking about studying sociol-
ogy. You may be wondering if sociology can help you in your job; you may 
just be curious about different ways of looking at society; or you may be won-
dering about sociology for a different reason. Whatever the reason, you’re 
reading this book because you want to know more about this thing called 
“sociology.”
In this book, I explain the basics of sociology: what it is, how it’s done, and 
what it’s good for. Along the way, I do mention a lot of specific findings that 
sociologists have made, but my main goal is to tell you about sociology, not 
about society. After you understand the basics of sociology, you can roll up 
your sleeves and get online or into the library to see what sociologists have 
learned about any given place or time.
This chapter provides a road map to the rest of the book. In this chapter, I 
summarize the book and explain the basic ideas that this book will cover. I’ve 
organized the book to proceed from basic concepts to more specific topics, 
but the chapters are designed to stand alone, so you may not want to start 
right at the beginning.
Whatever path you take through this book — and through sociology 
generally — I hope you’ll enjoy it and find the topic of sociology as 
fascinating as I do.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
Understanding Sociology
In Part I of Sociology For Dummies, I explain the fundamentals of sociology: 
what it is, how it came to be, and how it’s done.
Defining sociology
In a nutshell, sociology is the scientific study of society. Sociologists use the 
tools and methods of science to understand how and why humans behave 
the way they do when they interact together in groups. Though social 
groups — or societies — are made up of individual people, sociology is the 
study of the group rather than of the individual. When it comes to under-
standing how the individual human mind works, sociologists largely leave 
that up to psychologists.
Most people who call themselves “sociologists” work in universities and col-
leges, where they teach sociology and conduct sociological research. They 
ask a variety of questions about society, sometimes wanting answers just for 
the sake of curiosity; however, many times their findings are used to inform 
decisions by policymakers, executives, and other individuals. Many people 
who study sociology go on to conduct sociological research outside of aca-
demia, working for government agencies, think tanks, or private corpora-
tions. Accurate, systematic study of society is in one way or another useful to 
just about everyone.
 
Studying sociology, whether or not you call yourself a “sociologist,” means 
taking a particular view of the world: a view that sociologist C. Wright Mills 
called “the sociological imagination.” You have to be willing to set aside your 
ideas about how the social world should work so that you can see how it actu-
ally works. That doesn’t mean that sociologists don’t have personal values 
and opinions about the social world; they believe that to change the world, 
you first need to understand it.
The history of sociology
Sociology is considered one of the social sciences — along with economics, 
psychology, anthropology, geography, and political science (among others). 
The social sciences were born in the 18th and 19th centuries, as people 
began applying the scientific method to human life and behavior. The world 
was changing dramatically and quickly as industrial production replaced 
agriculture, as democratic republics replaced monarchies, and as city life 

13
 Chapter 1: Sociology: Getting Your Head Around It
replaced country life. Realizing how many great insights science had lent 
regarding the natural world, people decided to try to use the same method to 
understand the social world.
Among the social sciences, sociology has always been unique in its ambition 
to understand the entire social world — considering all its aspects in combi-
nation rather than in isolation. It’s a daunting task, and one that sociologists 
are still struggling with today.
The most important early sociologists had clear ideas about how to study 
and understand society; these ideas still form the basis for much sociological 
investigation and discussion today. Karl Marx emphasized the importance 
of physical resources and the material world; he believed that conflict over 
resources is at the heart of social life. Emile Durkheim emphasized coopera-
tion rather than conflict: He was interested in the shared norms and values 
that make cooperative social life possible. Max Weber took ideas from 
both Marx and Durkheim and argued that both conflict and cooperation, 
both material resources and cultural values are essential to social life. (See 
Chapter 3 for more on Marx, Durkheim, and Weber.)
Over the past century, sociologists have continued to debate the early soci-
ologists’ ideas and have applied them to specific societies all over the world. 
Thanks in large part to the influence of “the Chicago School” of sociologists 
in the early 20th century (see Chapter 3 for more on them), sociologists 
today pay close attention to small groups and person-to-person interaction 
as well as to the grand sweep of social history. Today, sociologists appre-
ciate that the big questions and the little questions regarding society are 
interlinked, and that you can’t understand the macro (the big) without also 
understanding the micro (the little).
Doing sociology
From a scientific perspective, society is a very difficult subject to study: It’s 
huge, complex, and always changing. A perennial challenge for sociologists is 
to develop ways to accurately observe society, and to test hypotheses about 
the way it works.
Fundamentally, sociological research proceeds along the same lines as sci-
entific research in any discipline: You decide what you’re interested in, see 
what other researchers have learned about that subject, ask a specific ques-
tion, and find data to answer it; then you analyze those data and interpret 
your results. The next researcher to be curious about the topic takes your 
results into consideration when they conduct their own study.

14
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
Sociologists use both quantitative and qualitative research methods. (See 
Chapter 4 for more on these methods.) Quantitative research involves ques-
tions that are asked and answered in terms of numbers; qualitative research 
involves close observation and detailed descriptions, usually written. 
Quantitative studies usually make use of statistical methods — sometimes 
very sophisticated statistical methods— for determining whether or not a 
trend observed in a set of data is likely representative of a general population. 
In using statistics or any other research tool, sociologists must take great care 
to avoid any of several potential pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate or mislead-
ing interpretations of the data they observe.
Seeing the World as a Sociologist
To help make sense of the very complicated social world, sociologists have 
developed some useful perspectives — ways of thinking about the social 
world that both help them to understand that world and to ask interesting 
questions about it. Unless you understand these perspectives, sociology can 
be quite confusing. In Part II of this book, I explain a few of the most impor-
tant sociological perspectives.
Understanding culture
Sociologists differentiate between culture (that is, ideas and values) and 
structure (that is, the basic organization of society). Some sociologists tend 
to focus on culture, whereas others focus on structure; what’s safe to say is 
that both culture and structure can play important roles in shaping the social 
world. (See Chapter 5 for more on culture and structure.)
Understanding culture means understanding that ideas and values — includ-
ing those represented in art and in the media — don’t always perfectly 
reflect the way people behave. Sociologists of culture study the production 
of culture (how culture comes about) and the reception of culture (the effect 
of culture on people’s actions and beliefs) separately. (See Chapter 5 for 
more.) They also study different types and levels of culture, from mainstream 
culture (culture that is widely shared) to subcultures (cultures that exist in 
opposition to mainstream culture) to microcultures (cultures that are self-
contained within a broader set of cultures).
 
Culture can influence how people think about themselves as well as how they 
think about other people: It can unite as well as divide.

15
 Chapter 1: Sociology: Getting Your Head Around It
Microsociology
Understanding how society works at the micro level — that is, at the one-on-
one, person-to-person level — is especially tricky because it involves under-
standing how social norms and influences play out in each person’s head.
Sociologists, economists, and other social scientists are all tremendously 
concerned with understanding how people make decisions about their lives. 
Sometimes those choices make perfect sense (taking a job because you need 
the money to buy food to live), and sometimes they seem to make no sense 
at all (betting that money on a casino game you’re almost guaranteed to lose, 
or donating it to someone living on the other side of the world). 
 
A perennial hot topic in microsociology is understanding how and why people 
make decisions from moment to moment, taking into account both their indi-
vidual needs and their social circumstances.
Sociologists also study how people use social roles and rules to interact with 
other people. Sociologist Erving Goffman pointed out that every person is in 
a way like an actor on a stage: Your social identity is the role you play, and 
the setting in which you’re interacting with others is like the stage you’re 
performing upon. Everyone understands this to some extent, and they 
sometimes take advantage of the fact to get the things they want in life. (See 
Chapter 6 for more on microsociology.)
Network sociology
It’s not just your career advisor who’s talking about the importance of per-
sonal networks: In recent decades, sociologists have increasingly come to 
appreciate the fact that who you know (and how you know them) is of funda-
mental importance in determining everything from your values to your eco-
nomic and political power. A society isn’t just one big cloud of people who all 
breathe the same air, it’s a highly complex network in which each person is 
tied to other people by relationships that vary in nature and intensity. (More 
on network sociology in Chapter 7.)
You’re connected — either directly or through friends of friends of friends — 
to just about everyone in your society, but your ties to some people are 
much tighter than your ties to others. The people closest to you are sources 
of great support, but the people to whom you’re only distantly connected can 
be even more valuable when it comes to gaining information that your friends 
or coworkers can’t (or won’t) tell you. Your position in the social network 
determines what options you have when finding a job, making friends, or 
spreading your influence.

16
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
Some sociologists devote themselves specifically to network sociology, but 
just about every sociologist today uses the insights and methods of network 
analysis to some extent. In Chapter 7, I mention some of the specific social 
insights that have come from network analysis.
Understanding Differences Among 
People and Groups
An issue of paramount importance to sociologists is understanding differ-
ences and inequality among different social groups. In Part III of this book, 
I take a look at some of the principal lines that divide in society: among 
classes, among races, among religions, and between “deviant” and “non-
deviant” people.
Social stratification
The word “stratification” refers to different levels on top of each other, and it 
can be used for society as well as for rocks. Some people in any given society 
have more power and freedom than others — sociologists refer to these dif-
ferences as differences of social class. There seems to be class inequality in 
every society, but it’s much greater in some than in others, and sociologists 
have always debated whether or not significant class inequality is necessary 
for a society to function. (See Chapter 8 for more on social stratification.)
 
When you hear that someone is of a “higher class” than someone else, money 
is probably the first thing you think of, and indeed, money is certainly impor-
tant. However, sociologists emphasize that there are many different means of 
social inequality: not just money, but occupation, ability, motivation, social 
connections, credentials, specialized knowledge, and discrimination by race, 
sex, caste, or age.
Class systems change over time, and people’s positions in those class sys-
tems change even more frequently. Social mobility is something sociologists 
study closely.
Race and sex
Sociologists distinguish between race (a label that others assign to you) and 
ethnicity (the cultural group heritage with which you identify). They also dis-
tinguish between sex (your biological status: male or female) and gender (the 

17
 Chapter 1: Sociology: Getting Your Head Around It
way you identify your own status). All of these are among the most impor-
tant distinctions in any society. Race, ethnicity, sex, and gender often serve 
as justification for discrimination and stereotyping, but they can also serve 
as common ground for people to bond with one another. (See Chapter 9 for 
more on race and ethnicity.)
Questions of race and ethnicity are particularly important today, when immi-
gration is common and societies are increasingly diverse; but there are differ-
ent races and ethnicities in every society, so for better and for worse, issues 
regarding race and ethnicity are timeless. 
 
Institutionalized (that is, official) discrimination against members of particular 
races or sexes has happily declined sharply in recent decades, but distinc-
tions of race, ethnicity, sex, and gender remain profoundly important in shap-
ing how people see themselves and how they are seen by others.
Religion
Religion may seem like an unusual subject to study scientifically — but soci-
ologists aim to understand the entirety of the social world, and religious 
beliefs and institutions are at the very center of that world. It is not for soci-
ologists to determine what lies beyond this world, but sociologists can and 
do observe how religion affects people’s lives in the here and now.
Sociologists study both religious values — what people believe about the 
spiritual world, specifically as it affects their actions in this world — and reli-
gious organizations. Like all social organizations, religious organizations have 
changed over time. What has remained the same is that for many people in 
all societies, religious groups are among the most important groups in their 
lives. (More on religion in Chapter 10.)
Crime and deviance
For sociologists, crime is one type of activity that falls under the general cat-
egory of deviance. Deviance is defined as any kind of activity that varies from 
a social group’s norms; crime is deviance that is formally punished with sanc-
tions ranging from small fines to death.
Why do people commit crimes? Sociologists have different theories about 
that, but Durkheim famously observed that some form of crime has been 
present in every society ever known — in that sense, crime may or may not 
be good but it does seem to be “normal.” What counts as crime in any par-
ticular society is a matter of both that society’s specific laws and the social 
interactions surrounding the crime.

18
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
Can crime be stopped, or at least limited? Even if there is never a perfectly 
crime-free society, sociological research provides many clues as to how the 
worst crimes might be curtailed. In Chapter 11, I provide several examples.
Social Organization
Sociologists are indeed curious about the lines that divide people in society, 
but they’re equally curious about how people manage to work together. In 
Part IV of this book, I look at three major types of social organization that 
have been of great concern both to sociologists and to ordinary people who 
want to work and live together peacefully and productively.
Corporate culture
Whether you’re a high school student or a retired worker, you’ve had plenty 
of experience (maybe more than you’d like) with what sociologists call formal 
organizations: corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations of people 
working together to achieve some goal. Well, at least that’s what they say 
they’re doing.
Sociologist Richard Scott has pointed out that social organizations behave as 
rational, natural, and open systems. They are rational because they do typi-
cally work in a machine-like manner to achieve some goal, but they are also 
natural because humans are not machines and they bring their own foibles 
and idiosyncrasies into the workplace with them. Further, they are open 
insofar as their behavior is influenced by the behavior of other organizations 
around them. I explain this in more detail in Chapter 12.
Social movements and political sociology
What about organizations founded for a very clear purpose, such as to bring 
about social change? Do they ever work? Yes, but not always. Many sociolo-
gists have studied the circumstances under which social movements are suc-
cessful: In general, it seems to be a matter of being in the right place, at the 
right time, with the necessary resources to make your voice heard.
Understanding how and why social movements work (and don’t work) is 
related to the general subject of political sociology: the study of government, 

19
 Chapter 1: Sociology: Getting Your Head Around It
or “the state” in sociological parlance. Your government may seem to be big 
and invulnerable, but in the big picture, governments are quite fragile. (See 
Chapter 13 for more on the sociology of governments.)
 
Keeping a functioning government in business is a remarkable act of social 
cooperation, and when it doesn’t work, the resulting revolution can have 
disastrous consequences for millions.
Urban sociology
Sociology was born in cities; specifically, in the fast-growing cities of the 
Industrial Revolution. There, people from wildly different backgrounds were 
encountering one another in what sometimes seemed like a chaotic stew of 
humanity. There was violence, disease and poverty, and an electrifying mix of 
languages, values, and ideas.
And 200 years later, the world is more urban than ever. How, and why, do 
people keep living in cities? Inner-city life is still crowded and excitingly 
intense, but not all urban life is inner-city life. Over the past several decades, 
millions and millions of people around the world have moved into suburban 
communities. As those suburbs have aged, some residents have moved back 
into the inner cities whereas others have moved even further out, to newly 
built “exurbs.” All along, sociologists have been there to study urban (and 
suburban, and exurban) change. You can read about it in Chapter 14.
Sociology and Your Life
Getting right to the heart of things, what relevance does sociology have for 
your life? In Part V, I explain how sociology can change the way you under-
stand your past and your future.
The life course
Your life course, of course, is your own: You decide if and when you’ll go to 
school, marry, have children, and retire. Still, at every stage you’re affected 
by social institutions and social norms regarding the life course. What are 
you “supposed” to do? What happens if you don’t? The timing and nature of 
life-course transitions varies greatly among societies, and sociologists have 
studied why.

20
Part I: The Basic Basics 
As you live your life, you’ll be profoundly influenced by the families you’re 
a part of; sociologists and historians have shattered many myths about the 
family, and in Chapter 15 I explain how sociology can help you understand 
your own family. I also address the always-topical subject of health care, which 
influences not only how long you live but the quality of the life you have.
Social change
The one constant in social life is change: changing norms, changing classes, 
changing everything. Is there any way to make sense of all that change?
Sociologists believe there is, even if they sometimes disagree about exactly 
how. Marx believed that social change was driven by conflict over material 
resources. Durkheim thought that change was inevitable, with norms and 
values changing as societies became larger and more diverse. Weber thought 
that both material conflicts and changing norms influenced social change.
From the very beginning, sociologists have hoped to predict the future so as 
to be able to influence it. Sociology is, and will likely remain, a long way from 
being able to see the future any more clearly than meteorology can — but 
like weather forecasters, sociologists have a fair idea of when a storm front 
is brewing. What they may be most curious about is the future of sociology 
itself. Will sociology survive? What will society look like in the future? See 
Chapter 16 for my best guesses at the answers.
Sociology for Dummies, for Dummies
Still aren’t entirely sure about all this? Try flipping forward to Part VI, “the 
Part of Tens.” In chapters 17 and 18, I mention ten ways to use sociological 
insight in everyday life; also, I provide a list of ten readable sociology books 
that you can pick up if this book piques your interest. In Chapter 19, I list ten 
myths about society busted by sociology — ten things you may have thought 
you knew about the social world around you.
In the end, that’s my best argument for why you should read this book: to 
learn more about the social world around you. Sure, you’ll learn something 
about sociology itself — about Talcott Parsons’s public spat with C. Wright 
Mills, about Arlie Hochschild’s conversations with frustrated working moth-
ers, about the sociologists who went to Paducah, Kentucky to talk with fami-
lies affected by a tragic school shooting. But more importantly, in learning 
about sociologists’ attempts to understand the ever-changing social world, 
you’ll learn about that world itself, the world that gives meaning to your life.

 Chapter 1: Sociology: Getting Your Head Around It
Sociology: What’s the point?
I hope you’re excited to begin reading this book, 
but I don’t flatter myself that it’s the most impor-
tant thing in your life right now. What is the most 
important thing in your life right now? Are you 
just starting a romantic relationship — or just 
ending one? Is something important going on at 
work? Are you preoccupied with a tough situ-
ation involving a loved one, or are you excited 
about an upcoming vacation or graduation?
All of those things are very personal, but they’re 
also very social. You experience events like that 
individually, but your experience also involves 
the people around you — and the people 
around them, and the people around the people 
around them. As much as your life is your own, 
it is fundamentally, profoundly influenced — in 
some ways, defined — by the society in which 
you live.
If you’ve done any traveling, or read books or 
see movies about other cultures, you realize 
how much norms, values, and practices vary 
from one society to the next. The choices you 
make are your own, but the choices you’re 
given come from the society you’re in, as does 
a lot about the way you regard those choices. 
If you don’t understand how your society works 
and how it’s shaped your life, you’re in the 
dark about important parts of yourself. Only by 
understanding your society — which sociology 
can help you to do — can you truly understand 
yourself.

What Is Sociology, and 
Why Should I Care?
In This Chapter
▶ Defining sociology
▶ Understanding where sociology is used
▶ Identifying how sociology affects your life
A
lthough you’ve heard the word sociology, you may not really know what 
it means. Maybe you think sociology is the same thing as social work, 
or you confuse it with psychology or anthropology. Perhaps you’ve noticed 
that sociologists tend to pop up in the news to discuss social problems like 
racism or violence. You might have an idea that sociologists study social 
problems, but you don’t really know how sociologists actually conduct their 
studies. Like most people, you probably envision a few guys in tweed jackets 
sitting in offices and pontificating about why everyone’s so screwed up.
In this chapter, I explain in clear terms exactly what sociology is, what a 
sociological question is, and how, in a general sense, a sociologist would go 
about finding an answer to it. I list some of the most important settings in 
which sociology works — or where sociology is done, even by people who 
may not consider themselves sociologists. Finally, I explain how sociology 
affects your life today and how learning more about sociology will help you in 
the future.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll know enough to join the guys in the tweed 
jackets and do some pontificating of your own. But even if your friends aren’t 
burning up with curiosity about sociology, after you understand a little bit 
about what it is, you’ll be hooked.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
Figuring Out What Sociology Is
A student-written university course guide once jokingly defined sociology 
as the study of “everything in the whole wide world.” That definition isn’t 
entirely untrue; sociologists study just about everything people do. And how 
sociologists study just about everything people do defines sociology.
Defining sociology
The definition of sociology, after you’ve learned it, is easy to remember 
because the definition is right there in its name: soci for “society” and ology 
for “the study of.” Sociology is the study of society.
Social sciences take a systematic approach to the analysis of human lives and 
interactions. And sociology, which is considered a social science, is generally 
grouped with the following areas of study:
 
✓ Psychology
 
✓ Anthropology
 
✓ Economics
 
✓ Political science
 
✓ Ethnic studies (for example, African-American studies or Latino studies)
 
✓ Area studies (for example, Asian studies or European studies)
 
✓ Gender studies (for example, women’s studies)
 
✓ Cultural studies
 
Sociology shares a general approach with all these fields, and sociologists 
often read work by or collaborate with experts in these disciplines. But soci-
ologists insist on reserving the right to study any of those topics. Politics, 
economics, culture, race, gender . . . sociologists believe that these all inter-
act with one another, and if you try to study just one of those areas in isola-
tion, you risk missing important information about how a social group or 
situation works. So, you can study just about anything having to do with 
humans’ social life and call it sociology — but only if you study it in a scien-
tific, systematic way.

25
 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
Studying society scientifically
If you’ve ever participated in a science fair, you know how the scientific 
method works. You:
 
1. Ask a question.
 
2. Set up an experiment or a study that can provide an answer to that 
question.
 
3. Make very careful observations.
 
4. Analyze your observations to see what answer they might provide.
Scientists believe the scientific method is the best way to study the natural 
world, and social scientists believe that’s the best way to study the social 
world, too. However, one of the hardest things to understand about sociology 
is also one of the most important: Sociologists have asked many important 
questions about society, but the most important contribution of sociology is 
not the answers to those questions. It’s the fact that they were asked at all.
What makes studying society in a scientific manner so difficult, but ultimately 
so rewarding, is that to do so you have to set aside your own biases and pre-
conceptions about how society “should” work. If you’re going to study social 
norms objectively, you’re going to have to understand that your own norms 
and values aren’t the only ones that exist, and you’re going to have to put 
aside any question of whether your own norms and values are the “best.”
Emile Durkheim, one of the founders of sociology (more about him in 
Chapter 3) used what has been called an “organic metaphor” for society. 
Not everyone agrees that his model is the right way to understand how 
society works, but it’s a good way to start understanding what society is.
Durkheim said society is like a human body — one big thing made up of many 
smaller parts. Your body is made of many different systems (nervous system, 
respiratory system, digestive system) that are themselves made up of organs 
(brain, lungs, stomach), and the organs are made of billions of cells of all dif-
ferent types. In this way, you are your cells because there’s nothing in your 
body that’s not made of cells; however, your cells aren’t you. It’s only when 
your cells all work together that they make you who you are. There’s not any 
one cell that is “you” — you are all of your cells, working together in organs 
and systems to make up the total person who is sitting there, breathing and 
thinking and holding this book.

26
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Society is like that — but much bigger and even more complicated. A soci-
ety is made up of many people acting together in groups and systems, all of 
which act together (even if they don’t always cooperate, they at least affect 
each other). Your country is a society, but no one person — not even the 
president or the prime minister — is the society. The society is all the people 
in your country interacting together. Just like a body is, in a sense, what hap-
pens when a lot of different cells interact together, a society is what happens 
when a lot of people interact together.
 
Just as you need to look at an entire body to understand how the body works, 
sociologists believe that you need to look at an entire society to understand 
how society works. You can’t understand how a liver works unless you under-
stand its place in the body, and sociologists believe that you can’t understand 
how any part of society (a company, an ethnic group, a small town) works 
unless you understand its place in society.
Asking and answering 
sociological questions
To study society scientifically means asking scientific questions about society. 
A scientific, sociological question is a question about how society works — 
not about how it should work, but about how it does work. Of course, asking 
and answering such questions takes some finesse. So the following two sec-
tions give you more detailed info on how scientific, sociological questions 
should be formed as well as answered.
Putting together empirical questions
Sociological questions are in the general category of questions known as 
empirical questions. An empirical question is a question that can be answered 
by gathering facts. To best understand how to construct an empirical ques-
tion for sociological study, you may find it helpful to consider the differences 
among the following types of questions: 
 
✓ Theoretical question: A question about ideas, which can be answered 
with other ideas. If I ask, “What is racism?” I’m asking a theoreti-
cal question — I’m looking for a general definition of what is called 
“racism.”
 
✓ Moral question: A question about how things “should” or “should not” 
be. If I ask, “Should there be racism?” I’m asking a moral question — I’m 
asking you to make a value judgment about whether it is right to judge 
someone by the color of his or her skin.

27
 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
 
✓ Empirical question: A question that can be answered by gathering 
facts. If I ask, “Does racism exist in this society?” I’m asking an empirical 
question — I’m looking for information about the world that can be 
determined by making observations. 
In this case, if I want to fight racism, I can do so more effectively if I have 
accurate information about how, where, and why people act in a racist 
manner. Sociologists are strong believers in the value of seeing society as it 
actually is, not as they want it to be.
How I became a sociologist
The story of how I became a sociologist may 
help you to understand what’s unique about 
the sociological perspective, and to think about 
how sociology can cause you to think differ-
ently about your job and your life.
When I was in high school and looking for a job, 
I quickly decided that being a babysitter was a 
lot more fun than being a golf caddy. So I ended 
up babysitting for many different families. Doing 
that work, I temporarily took the place of many 
different parents with many different views on 
child-rearing: TV, or no TV? Strict bedtime, or 
whenever the kids get tired? Organized activi-
ties, or free play? Needless to say, every set of 
parents thought theirs was the “right” way to 
raise children. They might check out a stack 
of parenting books from the library, but they 
would usually end up sticking with the one that 
told them to do whatever it was that they were 
going to do anyway.
I went on to study education in college, but 
my favorite course was one on the history of 
education, where we learned about the many 
changes in people’s views of children and how 
they learn. Again, I was struck by how in every 
time and place, people were convinced that 
they had it all figured out. What made us so sure 
that we finally had it “right”?
Eventually, I realized that I was interested not 
in the education of children, but rather in the 
sociology of childhood — the study of different 
ideas about what children should do, and what 
those changing ideas have to do with changes 
in other areas of society. For my doctoral dis-
sertation in sociology I studied the history of 
children’s books and media: how changes in 
technology and child-rearing have affected 
what we value in our children’s reading mate-
rial. I systematically gathered articles about 
children’s books and media and analyzed 
them to test my hypothesis that, in our con-
cern that kids aren’t reading enough, we have 
become much more open-minded about what 
we consider “good” reading material for chil-
dren. I called the dissertation From Captains 
Courageous to Captain Underpants.
Becoming a sociologist allowed me to pursue 
questions that I felt needed to be answered: 
How do we decide what’s right and wrong 
whether it comes to kids’ books, or anything 
else? How do our society’s norms and values 
come to be? Why do the people in one neigh-
borhood have completely different ideas about 
child-rearing than the people in the next neigh-
borhood? Those are fundamentally sociological 
questions.

28
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Generalizing answers
Sociological questions are questions about society — but of course, you can’t 
just look at “society.” You have to look at a society, at specific people in a 
specific place at a specific time. Still, sociologists want to understand how 
human society works in general — so they try to ask and answer questions in 
a way that allow them to generalize as much as possible to other places and 
times. Here are some examples of sociological questions, and studies that 
might help provide answers.
 
✓ Does the extent of discrimination vary by the size of the minority 
group? A sociologist might look at sexism in companies with different 
gender ratios — is sexism more or less severe when there are more 
women in the workforce?
 
✓ Does the quantity of social ties affect the quality of social ties? A 
sociologist might conduct interviews to see whether people with more 
acquaintances overall have as many — or fewer — close friends com-
pared to people with fewer acquaintances overall.
 
✓ Is inequality inherited? A sociologist might conduct a survey to see 
whether people raised in poverty grow up to have different jobs than 
people raised in wealth.
These are big, complicated questions, but they’re questions that do have 
answers! The trick is finding out what those answers are when your ques-
tions are about something as massive as society. It’s not easy, but sociolo-
gists are ready for the challenge. (In Chapter 4, I go into more detail about 
how, specifically, sociological studies are conducted.)
 
Looking at the previous questions, you probably have guesses as to what the 
answers are. Your guesses may be right, but remember that they are guesses — 
these are empirical questions that do have right and wrong answers, and the 
only way to know for sure is to go out and gather data. Over the course of this 
book you’ll come across many examples of sociological findings that may sur-
prise you, so you need to be careful not to assume that your guesses about how 
society works are correct.
Discovering Where Sociology Is “Done”
So who studies sociology? Where are all those sociologists hiding? As it 
happens, they’re hiding in plain sight; people in many different settings and 
organizations use sociology to understand society and help solve social 
problems. Some of these people call themselves sociologists and some of 
them don’t (depending on their jobs, they might call themselves “research-
ers” or “program officers” or “reporters”), but they all make use of sociologi-
cal findings and ideas.

29
 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
Colleges and universities
The loudest, proudest sociologists are found in institutions of higher learn-
ing, where they explicitly teach sociology to (more or less) eager young 
minds. Many colleges and universities offer undergraduate and graduate 
degrees in sociology, and coursework in sociology is often a requirement 
for students majoring in social science (for example economics, psychology, 
and political science) or in fields where they will be working with people (for 
example education, social work, and law enforcement). Elective courses in 
sociology can also be very popular, especially when they deal with interest-
ing subjects like sex and gender, media and culture, or race and immigration.
A lot of sociological research also goes on at colleges and universities, espe-
cially at research universities where faculty members are required to have 
active research agendas. A professor of sociology at a research university 
might be busy coordinating a team of research assistants working on a major 
study; training doctoral candidates who will become professors themselves; 
and teaching undergraduate courses in sociology. Professors with particular 
specialties may hold joint appointments with other schools (a medical school 
or law school) or departments (an African-American studies department 
or an anthropology department) at the same university. Faculty members, 
graduate students, and even advanced undergraduate students often travel 
to sociology conferences where they share their completed or ongoing work 
with colleagues from other institutions.
Sociology is also taught at many high schools, sometimes under the general 
heading of “social studies.” It’s relatively unusual for someone to be a full-
time sociology teacher at a high school — but there are the lucky few!
Think tanks and research institutes
Research institutes, sometimes called think tanks, are organizations that 
focus on research in a particular area. Often they’re more agenda-driven than 
colleges or universities, and they often receive funding from people who sup-
port a certain cause such as:
 
✓ A political party
 
✓ Children’s welfare
 
✓ Women’s rights
 
✓ Access to health care
 
✓ A position on abortion
 
✓ Free trade

30
Part I: The Basic Basics 
People with an interest in social issues like these have an interest in gather-
ing facts that will help them accomplish their mission most effectively or 
garner support for their cause. Trained sociologists who are familiar with 
research findings and skilled in conducting studies often work at these orga-
nizations alongside psychologists, political scientists, experienced journal-
ists, and other experts.
These organizations often publish research reports that can affect policy 
and rally the public around a cause. When you hear a news report about a 
current study whose results sound provocative — for example, that a large 
number of young children have TVs in their rooms — it often comes from an 
organization like one of these.
Nonprofit organizations
Every nonprofit organization, from Greenpeace to the Girl Scouts to the 
Boston Ballet, has a mission it is seeking to accomplish, and sociologists 
often work with these organizations to help them do so most effectively and 
efficiently.
A Big Brothers/Big Sisters organization, for example, may want to know 
whether it’s best to pair kids with big “siblings” who have similar backgrounds, 
or whether it’s more beneficial to introduce kids to mentors from other walks 
of life who can introduce them to new people and places. A sociologist can 
help make this decision based on what other sociologists have discovered, or 
perhaps conduct a study to see what has worked best in other contexts.
The people who do this work may or may not call themselves sociologists, 
but in systematically gathering and analyzing information about the social 
world, they are “doing” sociology.
Government
Governments are the biggest non-profits of all, and they face all the same 
challenges on a much larger scale. At all levels and in all units of government, 
sociologists can help shape policy and allocate funding so that the many 
goals of government — from educating children to keeping the peace — are 
met as successfully as possible.
 
✓ Legislators turn to sociologists for advice on which programs and poli-
cies might be most effective. What can government do to reduce unem-
ployment, to provide for the elderly, to support single parents? Which 
foreign policy initiatives are likely to be successful? If a neighboring 
country becomes unstable and dangerous, what should be done to pre-
vent a catastrophic civil war?

31
 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
 
✓ Law enforcement officers must use their limited resources to prevent 
crime from happening and, when it occurs, minimize the damage and 
apprehend the perpetrators. Is there any way to predict how and when 
crime will occur? Can criminals be rehabilitated, and how can they 
be supported upon their release from jail so that they don’t return to 
crime?
 
✓ Social workers in government agencies help people whose lives are 
made difficult by troublesome social situations — from poverty to family 
conflicts to health struggles. What are the best strategies for helping 
people in these situations? Should government provide financial sup-
port, food assistance, skills training, or other resources? How much, for 
how long, and to whom?
 
✓ Teachers and educational administrators find it enough of a challenge 
to teach reading, writing, and ‘rithmatic, but also face a host of other 
social issues. How can bullying be prevented? Why do students drop out 
of school, and how can schools get them back? Should schools sponsor 
extracurricular activities — and if so, which ones?
These are just a few of the difficult and important social questions that 
governmental agencies face. Sociologists — sometimes working directly for 
these agencies, sometimes coming in as consultants — can help these agen-
cies make well-informed decisions.
Journalism and reporting
I work as a journalist in addition to teaching sociology, so I’ve experienced 
firsthand how a background in sociology can help inform news reporting.
There are important differences between journalism and sociology. 
Journalists must publish news much more often, and much more quickly 
than sociologists, so they usually don’t have time to conduct the kind of 
systematic study that sociologists prefer. But journalists share sociologists’ 
interest in understanding what makes society tick, and they’re out on the 
front lines reporting on social change.
When violence flares up in a particular neighborhood, sociologists can lend 
perspective and later may conduct a detailed study of the conflict, but jour-
nalists have to be there immediately. And a journalist who’s trained in soci-
ology or who knows what sociologists have discovered about violence and 
urban life is in a good position to understand what is happening even as it 
unfolds.
Plus, it’s through journalists that the public learns about findings in sociol-
ogy and other scientific disciplines, so journalists need to be able to think 
critically about these studies, or they risk misleading readers.

32
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
When reading a news story, ask yourself what assumptions the reporter is 
making. Does the story seem to suggest that things “should” be a certain way? 
If so, that is an opinion or a value judgment rather than a statement of fact. In 
the case of a crime report, for example, there may empirically be logical rea-
sons for that crime — whether or not you think it “should” have happened. 
(See Chapter 11 for more on the sociology of crime.)
Business and consulting
Many sociologists at colleges and universities focus on understanding how 
businesses and the economy work, but businesspeople aren’t about to leave 
that job entirely to professors! The kind of social analysis that sociologists do 
is critical to success in business, where the stakes are high and mistakes can 
be costly. If sociologists are curious about how information flows through dif-
ferent kinds of social networks, you can bet that marketers and retailers are 
wondering as well. Sociologists need to set aside their personal biases and 
study a social situation objectively; successful businesspeople understand 
this as well. Just because you think something is a great idea doesn’t mean 
it’s actually going to fly with your customers.
Management consultants are similar to sociologists — in fact, they often are 
sociologists who have earned degrees in the subject. A management consul-
tant’s job is not to be an expert in any one industry, but to look at a company 
and see how problems with its organization may be keeping it from perform-
ing as effectively and efficiently as possible. The success of management 
consultants is proof of the fundamental sociological principle that something 
you learn from one social situation may be generalizible to another. Whether 
you’re Cap’n Jack’s Frozen Fish or Cathy’s Computers, you’re going to face 
certain challenges that are universal, such as employee motivation, supply 
chain management, publicity, and advertising.
Everyday life
Let’s face it, it’s not easy being you — or being me, or being anyone in 
today’s big, complicated, diverse global society. You’re presented with a 
dizzying array of choices every minute of every day of your life, and whether 
you’re choosing a husband or choosing a brand of toothpaste, it can be 
really tough to know what choices to make. Sometimes you just go with your 
gut feelings, sometimes you act on your detailed knowledge of a particular 
situation or person, and sometimes you just choose randomly — but a lot of 
the time, you’re thinking sociologically even if you don’t realize it. Consider 
these situations:

33
 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
 
✓ You’re going to a job interview or an important party, and you want to 
know how to dress.
 
✓ You’ve started dating a coworker, and you’re trying to figure out how to 
reconcile your professional and personal roles.
 
✓ You’re buying a house, and you want to know what different neighbor-
hoods will be like in ten years’ time.
In each of those situations, you’re thinking sociologically — you’re trying 
to figure out how society works so you can make it work to your advantage. 
Sociology affects your life every day. (For specific examples of how you can 
use sociology in your own life, see Chapter 18.)
Recognizing How Sociology Affects 
Your Life and Your World
Okay, sociology is everywhere. So what? Why should you care? What can 
learning about sociology do for you besides helping you pass a class or make 
scintillating cocktail-party conversation?
 
Sociologist Randall Collins uses the phrase sociological insight to describe the 
way that learning to think sociologically can change your entire perspective 
on the world. In his book of that title, Collins offers many examples, including 
the sociological insights that crime is normal (see Chapter 11 of this book) 
and that being in a relationship is like owning property (see Chapter 6). 
Understanding these insights doesn’t mean you’re going to stop prosecuting 
criminals or start treating your husband like a doormat, but it does put peo-
ple’s behavior in an interesting new light.
Sociological insight may be sociology’s greatest contribution to the world, 
and it can make a difference in your life as well. In this section I mention sev-
eral ways that thinking sociologically can make a difference in your life.
Thinking about the social world 
in an objective, value-free way 
When I started teaching sociology at a technical college, the dean made clear 
to me that my number one job was to help my students critically examine 
their own beliefs about the social world. The students at that college go on 
to serve as police officers, nurses, teachers, and therapists — all professions

where they’re certain to encounter people from a wide range of backgrounds. 
Going into any of those careers with cultural blinders on can lead to unfortu-
nate, perhaps even dangerous, misunderstandings. Consider these hypotheti-
cal situations:
 
✓ As a law enforcement officer, you are called to a college campus where 
neighbors report that a group of boys are skateboarding on a set of 
concrete benches, making loud noise and damaging the benches. You 
grew up being told to stay away from “skate punks” who “probably are 
doing all kinds of drugs” and “have no respect for authority.” When you 
arrive on the scene, you see the boys — laughing, smoking, cheering one 
another on as they try to perform complicated tricks.
 
✓ As a nurse, you see a female patient who seems to have severe discom-
fort in her abdomen — but she can’t tell you about it directly because 
she doesn’t speak English. Her husband translates for her in his own 
imperfect English, and they refuse to allow one of your clinic’s transla-
tors to help. “Only I can speak for my wife,” says the husband.
 
✓ As a teacher, you have a student who regularly misses class and is fall-
ing behind in her work. When you call her mother in for a conference, 
the mother explains that she’s a single parent of three children, and 
she’s working two jobs to support her family. Sometimes she needs to 
ask her daughter to skip school to take care of the younger kids. She 
doesn’t see anything wrong with that. “Family comes first,” she says.
These are all difficult situations, and it’s not obvious what would be the best 
way to handle any of them. What won’t help, though, in any of these cases, 
is trusting that your cultural values and norms are the “right” ones, and that 
anyone who disagrees is wrong. Some might say that the skateboarders are 
deviant, that the husband is abusing his wife, and that the mother is exploiting 
her daughter. Maybe all those things are true, but it’s important to understand 
that the people you’re dealing with in all those situations may have very differ-
ent definitions of what constitutes deviance, abuse, and exploitation.
 
To say that sociology can help you to approach these situations in a “value-
free” way is not to say that you should check your values at the door, but it 
is to say that sociology can help you understand the difference between your 
own values and others’ values. No sociologist would say that all criminals are 
just misunderstood, or that there is no such thing as spousal abuse or child 
exploitation. Instead a sociologist would emphasize that all those things need 
to be carefully, objectively defined so that you can deal with people fairly and 
sympathetically. Applying terms like “deviance” or “exploitation” shouldn’t be 
just a matter of “I know it when I see it.” Learning to distance yourself, when 
necessary, from your own preconceptions is useful in any field of endeavor.

 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
Visualizing connections across 
times and places
In recent years, sociologists have studied all these topics:
 
✓ Neighbors’ coordinated efforts to defend Paris when it was under siege 
in 1871. (Roger V. Gould)
 
✓ The organization of the Burning Man festival in Nevada’s Black Rock 
Desert. (Katherine K. Chen)
 
✓ Women’s mobilization into the Salvadoran Guerrilla Army. (Jocelyn 
Viterna)
 
✓ People’s discussions of moral order in Europe during the Reformation 
and the Enlightenment. (Robert Wuthnow)
 
✓ Families going through funhouses at an amusement park. (Jack Katz)
That’s just a tiny sampling of the incredibly diverse array of subjects sociolo-
gists study. The studies are about wildly different events, places, and times, 
but they all appeared in mainstream sociological journals or books, meant to 
be read by all sociologists.
The reason sociologists pay attention to studies about very different subjects 
is that sociologists believe there are important common elements across 
all of human experience. Sociologists believe that the organization of the 
Burning Man Festival may, if carefully studied, have something to teach us 
about social organization generally; and that women’s mobilization into the 
Salvadoran Guerrilla Army may have something to teach us about women’s 
(and men’s) mobilization into political parties or protest movements any-
where in the world. Revealing the connections and similarities uniting very 
different places, times, and settings is one of the most powerful and impor-
tant tasks sociology can do. 
Uncovering what really matters . . . 
and what doesn’t
The social world is incredibly complicated, and neither sociologists nor 
anyone else have completely figured out how it works. Sociologists are 
sometimes criticized for oversimplifying the social world, but believe me, 
sociologists are painfully aware of just how complicated the social world is! 
When you spend years of your life trying to design studies that will shed even 
a little bit of light on a question — such as what causes people to commit 

36
Part I: The Basic Basics 
crimes — you begin to appreciate how many different factors affect people’s 
lives and how difficult it can be to say anything that’s generally true about 
large numbers of people.
That said, sociologists have developed powerful tools to help understand 
how society works, and sociology can help to cut through the confusion to 
focus attention on what really matters. Many sociological studies have shown 
that what people assumed were very important are, in fact, not such a big 
deal. For example:
 
✓ Frank Dobbin, Alexandra Kalev, and Erin Kelly studied companies that 
tried to make their workforces more racially diverse. They found compa-
nies that held big, showy diversity training programs became, on aver-
age, no more diverse than they’d been before the programs. Companies 
that actually assigned a person to keep an eye on hiring saw much 
better results.
 
✓ Jason Kaufman and I studied high school students’ exposure to the arts, 
trying to see what made kids more likely to attend competitive colleges. 
We found that kids whose parents attended art museums were much 
more likely to attend elite colleges — and that it made no difference 
whatsoever whether or not the kids even went along!
 
✓ The “broken windows” theory of policing, famously advocated by New 
York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s, holds that neighborhoods with 
signs of disorder are more likely sites for crime — that if criminals see a 
broken window in one building, they figure it’s okay to break a window 
in the next. Sociologists Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush, 
though, found that although it’s true that people’s perceptions of a neigh-
borhood’s “disorder” make a difference in the neighborhood’s crime rate, 
people see evidence of “disorder” not as much in broken windows but in, 
sad to say, the mere presence of racial minorities like blacks and Latinos.
These studies are examples of how sociologists, rather than oversimplifying 
the world, have shown exactly how complicated it is. It’s more obvious how 
people should change their actions based on the diversity-training study 
than what they should do after learning about the college attendance study 
or the neighborhood disorder study — parents probably aren’t going to 
start visiting art museums to make their kids more likely to go to Yale, and 
police certainly aren’t going to tell African-Americans and Latinos to stay out 
of sight — but now you know that it’s barking up the wrong tree to drag your 
kids to museums to make them more attractive college candidates or to 
spend a lot of money fixing broken windows in hopes of keeping crime down. 
Sociology can help reveal what really matters, and what really doesn’t.

 Chapter 2: What Is Sociology, and Why Should I Care?
Informing social policy
If you live in a democracy, you’re a policymaker — your vote helps to deter-
mine which politicians are elected and which laws are passed. Thinking 
sociologically can help you to choose wisely.
Every social policy is a sociological argument, whether or not the people who 
created the policy think about it that way. A social policy is a government 
action designed to change a society in some way. Knowing which action to 
take to achieve a certain goal can be difficult, and as politicians and pundits 
argue about the merits of various pieces of legislation, they are often having 
sociological debates about how society works, what (if anything . . . but there’s 
always something) is wrong with it, and how that problem might be fixed.
It’s all in the family . . . or is it?
One of the most controversial sociological 
arguments about social policy was a report 
issued in 1965 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a 
social scientist who was then U.S. assistant 
secretary of labor. The report, a private memo-
randum to President Lyndon Johnson that was 
quickly leaked to the press, was called The 
Negro Family: The Case for National Action. The 
memo, which became known as “the Moynihan 
Report,” was Moynihan’s attempt to convince 
President Johnson to promote marriage and 
stable family life among African-Americans.
Moynihan saw blacks as still healing from the 
devastating effects of slavery, which ripped 
families apart. The high rate of family instabil-
ity among African-Americans, said Moynihan, 
caused large numbers of black children to grow 
up in troubled circumstances, to do poorly in 
schoolwork and job searches, and to turn to 
crime and deviance.
Critics of the Moynihan Report said that 
Moynihan (who was white, and had himself 
grown up in a poor, single-parent family) was 
“blaming the victim” and letting whites off the 
hook for the racism and discrimination that was 
doing far more than any private family issues 
to keep blacks from succeeding in the United 
States. Others — including Martin Luther King, 
Jr. — said that Moynihan was right on, and that 
the government should do more to promote 
family stability.
To this day, sociologists and lawmakers debate 
the Moynihan Report. Given that government 
has limited resources and can’t do everything, 
should it focus on ending discrimination or on 
supporting families? And what does “support-
ing families” even mean? Is there anything gov-
ernment agencies can do to discourage divorce 
or out-of-wedlock births? Is that the govern-
ment’s job, or should government stay out of 
people’s personal lives? The answers weren’t 
obvious then and aren’t obvious now — but the 
Moynihan Report has helped inspire decades of 
sociological research that can help lawmakers 
make well-informed decisions.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
It’s kind of like looking under the hood of a car and trying to figure out what’s 
making that clanking noise, or why one headlight has mysteriously stopped 
working. If you don’t know how a car works, you’re going to have a very 
hard time fixing it — and the same principle applies for society. Without the 
benefit of sociology and the other social sciences, legislators are just making 
rough guesses about what policies might work to lower crime or to help small 
businesses. (In fact, that was one of the reasons sociology was invented — 
more about that in Chapter 3.)
Keeping a unique perspective 
for everyday problems
Sociology is about society rather than about the individual, but it would 
be a mistake to think that sociology has no bearing on your individual life. 
Sociology can be tremendously liberating when you apply it to the society (or 
societies) you live and work in every day.
You live in a maze of implicit and explicit rules that tell you how to dress, 
how to act, who to hang out with, who to hook up with, where to go to school, 
where to work and how to spend the money you make, what car to drive, 
where to go on vacation, and even where and when to blow your nose. You 
don’t have to obey those rules, but if you don’t, you risk social disapproval or 
even — if you break a rule that’s been written into law — imprisonment. The 
consequences of wearing an unfashionable outfit to a party are just as real as 
the consequences of walking into a wall.
But unlike the rules of physics, the rules of society can change. If there’s 
something about society that you don’t like, you can work to make society 
different. Not only can sociology help you to see different possibilities, it can 
actually teach you effective strategies for bringing change about. The socio-
logical perspective is refreshing: it acknowledges that things are the way 
they are for a reason, that the organization of society is no accident — but 
that things can change, and if you understand how society works, you’re in a 
much better position to make that change happen.

Chapter 3
Making It Up as They Went Along: 
The History of Sociology
In This Chapter
▶ Developing sociology
▶ Understanding the three big names in sociology
▶ Defining sociology in the 20th century
▶ Exploring sociology today
Yes, this is the requisite history chapter — the flashback section, if you 
will. It’s here not just because it “has to be,” but because it actually has 
to be: Understanding how sociology was developed will help you understand 
how sociologists go about doing their thing today.
In this chapter, I start by covering the genesis of sociology; why people 
needed a new way of looking at the social world. I briefly tell you about the 
lives of the three most famous and influential sociologists — Karl Marx, Emile 
Durkheim, and Max Weber — and tell the story of how sociology traveled 
across the Atlantic, becoming more “down to earth” in the process. Finally, I 
chronicle the rise and fall of Talcott Parsons (the sociologist who almost fig-
ured it all out) and bring you up to the present day.
So . . . Who Cares about History?
I can hear you groan. Isn’t it enough to understand what sociologists do 
today? Why bother with learning what people used to think about society? 
Well, the following list gives you a few good reasons to learn at least a little 
bit about the history of sociology:
 
✓ Understanding why sociologists think the way they do and ask the 
questions they do: Even if sociologists today know a lot more than their 
predecessors did, they have the same essential concerns about society 
and social organization. The new approach to looking at the social 

40
Part I: The Basic Basics 
world — a scientific, systematic approach — developed by the first 
sociologists continues to provide the foundation of all sociology. The 
new science of sociology helped thinkers in 1830 cast aside their per-
sonal biases and come up with new solutions to social problems; it does 
the same today.
 
✓ Understanding “old” arguments and ideas that are still useful today: 
Over the course of sociology’s history there have been some pretty 
smart people who have come up with ideas and arguments that are 
still very useful today. Even though Karl Marx, for example, died over 
a hundred years ago, his work still inspires sociologists — and social 
activists — to be mindful of the conflict and exploitation that can take 
place in capitalist societies. Emile Durkheim’s argument that cultural 
values change as a society grows and roles differentiate has become all 
the more important as societies around the world have become bigger 
and more diverse. Max Weber’s discussion of “the iron cage” of modern 
life can seem eerily appropriate when you’re doing your taxes or wait-
ing in line at a government bureau. The concepts developed by Marx, 
Durkheim, and Weber are a common vocabulary that sociologists use as 
they discuss society today.
 
✓ Understanding which important ideas didn’t work out so well: If you 
have to reinvent the wheel, you might as well reinvent the round one 
instead of the square one! The name “Parsons” is almost a dirty word 
among many sociologists today, but Talcott Parsons’s work is still 
widely read. It’s a brilliant articulation of an idea about society — that 
everything is there for a reason, which was a very compelling idea that 
many of the world’s best sociologists were studying for years. It didn’t 
turn out to be the most accurate way to think about society, but learning 
why can help you avoid Parsons’s mistakes.
Thinking about Society before 
There Was Sociology
Sociology as we know it was developed in the 19th century, but it’s not like 
it took people all those centuries just to notice that there is such a thing 
as society! For all of human history, people have talked about society and 
debated its organization. Sociology was invented as a powerful tool for 
answering the questions that people had been wondering about for ages.
In this section, I explain how people first started thinking about society and 
describe the seismic social changes that inspired the development of sociol-
ogy in the 19th century.

 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
People are the same everywhere you 
go . . . except when they aren’t
When I say that people have long been aware of society, I don’t just mean 
that they noticed there were folks hanging around together in large groups — 
I mean that long ago, people noticed that there seems to be an organization 
to society. Whether you were a tribesman on the African savannah, a citi-
zen of ancient Athens, or a serf in medieval France, you might have looked 
around and noticed that your group and the next group over and the group 
beyond that had all managed to get themselves in some sort of order. You 
might notice certain constants among all groups: the haves and the have-
nots, the family, religion and spirituality, and organized production and trade 
of food and tools.
But just because these constants are always present in society doesn’t mean 
that they’re the same everywhere — there’s wide variation across social 
groups. Here’s what I mean:
 
✓ There are “haves” and “have-nots” in every society, but in some societ-
ies there are vast discrepancies between the fabulously wealthy and the 
dirt-poor, and in others the differences are not nearly as great.
 
✓ Every society has families of some sort, but in some societies those fami-
lies are small and in others they are large and multi-generational. Some 
societies are patriarchal (the male lineage is most important) and some 
are matriarchal (the female lineage is most important).
 
✓ Every society has some form of religion. In some cases this means strict 
laws enforced by powerful clerics whereas in other cases it means a 
free sense of spirituality with religious leaders who serve only as helpful 
guides.
 
✓ Food and tools are produced and traded in all societies, but think about 
the difference between traditional Native American cultures (many of 
which had little concept of “property” in the modern sense of the word) 
and capitalist society with its elaborate financial system.
Besides this variation in stable societies, there is sometimes outright 
social breakdown — with leaders toppled and civil wars raging for years or 
decades. People have always been curious about social organization: Why is 
society organized the way it is? Is it just random, or is there a method behind 
the madness? If people could understand how society works, they thought, 
maybe they could solve social problems like war and poverty.

42
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Pre-sociologists: People with 
ideas about society
For many centuries, people tended to focus on the similarities rather than 
the differences in social organization. If societies were different from one 
another, people thought, it must be because some were “right” and some 
were “wrong.” But who was to decide right from wrong? What follows is a list 
of people who have tried:
 
✓ Theologians: They argued that God (or the gods) had a plan for the 
world, and sacred scriptures might reveal that plan as God (or, again, 
the gods) intended it to be manifest. Feudal society in Europe and else-
where was run jointly by church and state leaders who believed they 
were running things the way God wanted them to be run.
 
✓ Philosophers: Many philosophers believed that the key to successful 
social organization lay in an accurate understanding of human nature. If 
philosophers could figure out, by means of reflection, observation, and 
discussion, what the essence of human nature was, they could design a 
perfect society. Plato’s Republic, one of the greatest works of classical 
philosophy, lays out Plato’s vision of an ideal society.
 
✓ Historians: Historians looked to the past to understand the present. 
Many historians were almost sociological in their comparison of past 
societies with present societies — in fact, the first sociologists were very 
interested in historical change — whereas others looked to the past for 
ideals to be emulated in the present. For example, many historians were 
convinced that when it came to an effective legal system, the ancient 
Romans had it figured out and that any successful legal system would 
have to be based on Roman law.
These theological, philosophical, and historical approaches were interesting 
and, in some cases, quite useful — but by the late 1700s it became clear that 
a new way of understanding society would be necessary. Society changed 
more and more quickly, and people became less and less convinced that the 
answers to society’s problems could be found in a 2,000-year-old book of 
scripture, philosophy, or law.
Political and industrial revolution: 
Ready or not, here it comes
There’s no shortage of tragic conflict, shocking social upheaval, and stun-
ning technological transformation in the 21st century — but even so, it’s 
difficult for people today to understand just how profound and disorienting 
were the changes that shook Western society in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
These changes were so shocking that they caused people to question their 

43
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
long-held assumptions about human nature and social organization, and to 
wonder whether the scientific method — which had been so useful in under-
standing the natural world — might not also be useful for understanding the 
scary and exciting new social world they were living in.
 
This is a topic that’s often in the news today: Is it possible to design a political 
system to be stable, or are some countries or social situations just naturally 
unstable? Turn to Chapter 13 for more information on government and politi-
cal revolutions, as well as information about social movements.
Political revolutions
The American Revolution of 1776 was certainly a wake-up call to the 
entrenched European powers, but it was nothing compared to the French 
Revolution and its associated conflicts, which tore across Europe from 1789 
to 1814. What was especially shocking about the French Revolution was the 
idea behind it: the idea that society needed to be fundamentally reorganized, 
with the hereditary monarchy stripped of their powers in favor of a demo-
cratically elected government.
And the French and Americans weren’t alone. In one country after another, 
traditional forms of government and social organization were violently chal-
lenged. More and more, people believed — and acted on their belief — that 
things should be different, that just because the kings and dukes and bishops 
had been in charge for centuries didn’t mean it had to be that way forever. 
For leadership to be something you were born into rather than chosen for, 
the revolutionaries believed, wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair.
Of course, the tricky thing about overthrowing one system of social organiza-
tion is that you have to replace it with something — and that is no easy task. 
Storming the Bastille and stuffing grass in aristocrats’ mouths was very liber-
ating, but what, exactly, was the next step? Who should be put in charge, and 
with what powers, and for how long? It took decades to create the relatively 
stable democratic institutions we know today, and along the way things got 
pretty messy. Complicating the whole process was the fact that technology 
was also changing rapidly.
The Industrial Revolution
From the late 18th century into the 19th century, quickly developing tech-
nology revolutionized (hence the name) life in Europe and its colonies. 
Previously, life for most people had been fairly straightforward: you were 
born into a particular family in a particular place, and you were more or less 
destined to do a particular job — probably not a very exciting one, some-
thing along the order of planting and harvesting. Maybe, if you were born in a 
town, you could have a career in the dynamic field of blacksmithing or go to 
work as a servant for the local royalty, who had themselves been born into 
their positions. You’d probably do some trading, but you’d likely build your 
own house and grow much of your own food. You were fundamentally tied to 
your place, your family, and your job. They defined you.

44
Part I: The Basic Basics 
With the arrival of industrial production, everything sped up and much less 
could be taken for granted. Farm production became more efficient, so fewer 
agricultural workers were needed — they flocked to the growing cities, where 
jobs were increasingly available in settings like factories and slaughter-
houses. Workers were paid in cash, which they had to use to buy everything 
they needed, from housing to food to entertainment. They jostled in among 
people from other areas, coming into sudden contact with other languages 
and cultural traditions.
On top of that, developments in transportation and communication technology 
were making the world a smaller place. People and information were getting 
around more quickly and more often, so many people whose grandparents 
would have lived in a very small world found themselves living in a very large, 
diverse world. Everything was getting bigger, faster, more powerful — and rev-
olution was in the air, with social arrangements that had lasted for centuries 
being cast to the wind.
Nothing, it seemed, could be taken for granted any more. What was right? 
What was wrong? Was there any way to make sense out of the chaos? 
Theologians and philosophers and historians were doing their best to figure 
things out, but it was clearly time for a new way of understanding the world.
The Development of “Sociology”
The first person to use the word “sociology” was Auguste Comte, a French 
thinker who coined the word in the early 1800s to refer to the systematic 
study of society. Still, it took almost a century for sociology to be fully estab-
lished as a legitimate field of study.
Figuring out life with positivism
Comte was one of a group of philosophers and historians who believed in the 
idea of positivism, the idea that the methods of the natural sciences could be 
productively used to study the social world. Positivism in the philosophical 
sense is not the same thing as “positive thinking,” but positivism is “positive” 
in the sense that it represents an optimistic belief in humans’ ability to figure 
things out and improve their circumstances.
In the early 1800s, even natural science was still somewhat revolutionary — 
it hadn’t been that long since natural scientists like Galileo faced death sen-
tences for daring to suggest that telescopes and microscopes could be used 
to supplement, or even challenge, the Church’s teachings about the natural 
world. If the powers that be didn’t care for the suggestion that the earth 

45
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
revolved around the sun, you can imagine how they felt about the idea that 
social arrangements might also be subject to scientific analysis!
This idea, which the early sociologists shared, continues to inspire sociologists 
today — and it can still feel revolutionary. In Chapter 2 I warn you to prepare 
yourself for the surprises that sociology might have in store for you, and those 
surprises can still hit with some of the shock that the early sociologists’ ideas 
had for their readers. Comte and other early sociologists argued that society 
might be better organized along principles that were very different from the 
principles along which it had been organized for centuries, and many people 
had a hard time accepting that idea. When sociologists today give people infor-
mation that challenges their long-held beliefs, they meet similar resistance.
Common themes of early sociologists
Comte and the other early sociologists — most of whom would have 
called themselves philosophers, historians, and/or economists instead 
of sociologists — had a variety of ideas about the social world, but their 
arguments shared some common themes. They questioned whether the 
traditional tools of their trades were really sufficient for the task of under-
standing the changing society they lived in.
Philosophers began to wonder whether it was time to make systematic 
observations of the world rather than speculating about human nature based 
entirely on their own experiences. Historians saw patterns in the progres-
sion of social arrangements through time, and wondered whether scientific 
theories might help explain human history the way, say, geology had helped 
to explain the history of the earth. Economists saw the power of the scien-
tific method when applied to trade and commerce, and wondered whether it 
might not be equally fruitful if applied to other areas of human activity — like 
politics and religion.
Over time, positivist thinkers from all these fields began to share certain 
ideas about the social world, ideas such as the following that became the 
underpinning for the new science of sociology.
 
✓ No king, priest, or philosopher could simply declare what social arrange-
ments were best; those should be determined by means of empirical 
study and systematic analysis.
 
✓ Society was progressing in a manner that wasn’t random. Social change, 
for better and for worse, made some kind of sense, and it had some kind 
of order or meaning to it.
 
✓ Although some amount of inequality might be unavoidable, inequality 
on the basis of social class, place of birth, or parentage was not only 
immoral but also inefficient.

46
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Sociology: The most ambitious science
Comte himself believed that the development of sociology was the logical 
result — in fact, the climax — of the development of science generally. 
Comte pointed out that if a village is settled on the bank of a river that 
sometimes floods, it will be frequently devastated — unless, through scien-
tific observation, the villagers learn to predict the floods. Why, he asked, 
Adventures in sociology
The Revolutionary Era was an exciting time to 
be in Europe, and even though it was a dan-
gerous time to be going around with bold new 
ideas about society, it was also a time when 
those ideas carried great weight and had real 
urgency. Some of the early sociologists lived 
lives of excitement and adventure such as 
sociologists today could only dream (or have 
nightmares) about.
Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caridal de 
Condorcet, one of the founders of sociology 
(though, preceding Comte, he did not call him-
self a “sociologist”), lived up to his fancy name 
by pioneering the idea of the social thinker as 
an en vogue cultural sophisticate and man-
about-town. His wife, it was said, was one of 
the most beautiful women in France. Condorcet 
was what today you might call a “limousine lib-
eral”: an aristocrat who nonetheless supported 
the overthrow of the aristocracy. He believed 
that human history was marked by the destruc-
tion of social inequality, and he was personally 
involved in the French Revolution — in fact, he 
drew up the declaration justifying the suspen-
sion of the king. When things got ugly, he was 
driven into hiding. He was ultimately discovered 
along with his heretical manuscript A Sketch 
for a Historical Picture of the Human Mind, and 
he paid the ultimate price for his daring proto-
sociological views: he died in prison, possibly 
from poisoning.
Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-
Simon (called Saint-Simon, not to be confused 
with his student Auguste Comte), was another 
man of action. He was among the troops France 
sent over to help the Colonial Army during the 
American Revolution, and was a captain of artil-
lery at Yorktown. He was imprisoned during the 
French Revolution, which ironically made him 
a rich man upon his release because, being in 
prison, he hadn’t been able to convert his hold-
ings into the Revolutionary currency that had 
become severely devalued. What did he do 
with his wealth? He partied until he was broke, 
and then he decided he might as well roll up his 
sleeves and do some writing.
Saint-Simon convincingly argued that only sci-
entists could put Europe back together after 
the destructive political revolutions it had 
experienced, and he became a very influential 
booster of social science. Further, he believed 
that social scientists should become a sort of 
secular priesthood, determining the shape of 
society with the benefit of their extraordinary 
insight.
After Saint-Simon’s death in 1825, his most 
ardent disciples formed a sort of cult, living 
together in a commune and advocating pro-
gressive social ideas from women’s liberation 
to collective ownership of property to free love. 
The experiment ended poorly, with the leaders 
going to jail. Sociologists, it seemed, weren’t 
quite ready to run the world.

shouldn’t it be the same with wars and other social conflicts? If people can 
learn to predict these conflicts, they can be avoided — or at least minimized.
The sciences, thought Comte, developed in a hierarchy from those studying 
the most fundamental subjects (mathematics, physics) to those studying the 
more complex subjects (chemistry, biology), to those studying the biggest, 
most complex subjects. Nothing is bigger or more complex than society, so 
sociology (which Comte first called “social physics”) sat at the top of the 
hierarchy as the most ambitious, most important science.
“There can be no scientific study of society,” Comte wrote, “either in its con-
ditions or its movements, if it is separated into portions, and its divisions are 
studied apart.” In other words, you can’t just look at the economy, or just look 
at the government, and expect to really understand how society works. You 
have to look at the whole enchilada. Comte’s argument is still the justification 
for sociology as its own science — and it’s still controversial.
When it came to the social sciences, sociology was not the only game in town 
even when Comte was writing. Economics had already been established as 
the scientific study of the economy, and psychology was being developed as 
the scientific study of the human mind. Comte knew this, and he explicitly 
made the case for sociology as a separate discipline lending insights that 
could not be achieved through those other disciplines.
Sociology’s Power Trio
From the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, just as sociology 
was coming to maturity as an academic discipline and a way of seeing the 
world, three men — working separately, but the later ones being familiar 
with the earlier ones’ work — came up with a series of ideas that deeply 
influenced sociology. The names Marx, Durkheim, and Weber are still com-
monly encountered at every level of sociology, from introductory high school 
classes to seminars on cutting-edge research. One company has even sold 
a sociology study guide that is a laminated card summarizing what Marx, 
Durkheim, and Weber might each say about topics from education to crime.
Understanding these men’s place in the history of sociology can be a little 
confusing because “sociology” as a standalone academic discipline took so 
long to get off the ground. Karl Marx lived after Comte and had some hugely 
important sociological ideas, but to his dying day he never called himself a 
sociologist. Emile Durkheim, working around the turn of the 20th century, 
proudly considered himself a sociologist, but he spent his life trying to con-
vince the rest of the world that sociology was a legitimate discipline. In 1919, 
three years after Durkheim’s death and almost a century after Comte coined 
the term, the department of sociology founded by Max Weber was still the 
very first one in Germany. (Meanwhile, way over in America at that time, 

48
Part I: The Basic Basics 
sociology departments were popping up left and right.) The bottom line is 
that all three of these thinkers were tremendously important for the develop-
ment of sociology as we know it today, despite the fact that sociology as we 
know it hardly existed during their lifetimes.
 
Take some time to understand the basics of what each of these three men 
thought. All three have become touchstones of sociological thought and will 
come up many times throughout this book (for example, their views on cul-
ture in Chapter 5, their ideas about religion in Chapter 10, and their theories of 
social change in Chapter 16), so for now I’ll just give you the very basics about 
who they were and what they thought.
Karl Marx
Karl Marx, born in 1818 in what is now Germany, was the first of these three 
great thinkers to come along. He never called himself a sociologist — that 
word was then too new to mean anything to most people — but he was a 
little bit of just about everything else. He started out studying law, became 
involved in philosophy and history, and later worked as a journalist and 
political activist.
Marx’s life and work were inspired by his disgust with the capitalist eco-
nomic system, especially with the way it kept millions of people toiling in 
dirty factories and parched fields with very little to show for their work at the 
end of the day. He was convinced there could be a better way, and he worked 
to support the Communist Party, a group dedicated to creating a society 
where everyone shared and shared alike. This rabblerousing got Marx kicked 
out of Germany, France, and Belgium, and he finally landed in England; he 
died in London in 1883.
Marx, working with his close friend and colleague Frederich Engels, wrote copi-
ous amounts. Some of his work, like the fiery Communist Manifesto, was widely 
read in Marx’s lifetime, but much of it took decades to be organized, published, 
and translated. It wasn’t until the 1930s that people truly understood every-
thing Marx was trying to say. (A lot of people still don’t quite get it.)
Sociologists consider Marx important for two main reasons: his general 
theory of history and his specific ideas about power and exploitation.
Marx on history
Marx’s theory of history is often called materialism (or, even more of a 
mouthful, dialectical materialism). You may think of a “materialist” as some-
one who only cares about money and material things — and though Marx in 
his personal life was the opposite of a greedy cash hound, he did think that 
material goods make the world go ‘round.

49
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
For Marx, the most important forces in history weren’t ideas; they were 
basically economic forces. Every stage in history, according to Marx, was 
distinguished by its own mode of production, a way of organizing the produc-
tion and distribution of material goods. Each mode of production (ancient 
slaveholding society, medieval feudalism, and so forth) has its own inherent 
conflicts among different classes, and those conflicts inevitably lead to the 
failure of one mode of production and the beginning of another.
This was an important new way of looking at history because earlier thinkers, 
such as the philosopher Hegel, had often seen historical change as being about 
ideas and culture. Marx dismissed immaterial ideas as relatively unimportant. 
Historical change, he said, is about class conflict over concrete things.
Marx on capitalism
Marx was particularly concerned with the mode of production that domi-
nated his time (and, he would be disappointed to learn, still dominates ours): 
industrial capitalism.
Marx wrote about a number of different class groups that he saw having roles 
in capitalism, but the two most important were:
 
✓ The bourgeois: the wealthy, powerful people who own the factories, the 
farmland, and just about everything else.
 
✓ The proletariat: the people who don’t own much and are forced to work 
for the bourgeois to feed their families.
Marx thought that capitalism was bad for everyone, but especially for the 
proletariat.
The proletariat, said Marx, are especially hurt by capitalism because they are 
viciously exploited by the bourgeois. No matter how much profit a factory 
owner makes in a day, if his workers don’t have anywhere else to work, all 
the owner needs to do is pay the workers enough to keep them alive — the 
bourgeois factory owner keeps all the extra profits, earned on the backs of 
the hardworking proletariat.
In a larger sense, though, Marx argued that everyone is hurt by capitalism 
because it’s a system that trades real things (work, food, shelter) for an 
imaginary thing: money. I might work all day in a factory assembling things 
that are going to be used by someone else, and I earn money that I use to buy 
food grown by someone else and to rent a house built by someone else. The 
value of my labor isn’t measured by what good I do for myself or my society; 
it’s measured by how much (or how little) money I make.
Marx thought the capitalist system was fundamentally unhealthy, and that it 
would one day be replaced by a worldwide communist utopia, where every-
one would contribute what they’re able and take what they need. Maybe 
someday it will, but you probably shouldn’t hold your breath waiting for it.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
Emile Durkheim
Halfway through this chapter that’s supposedly about the history of sociol-
ogy, you may be wondering when someone is finally going to bust out and 
call himself a sociologist. And . . . voila! The French scholar Emile Durkheim 
spent his life not just practicing sociology, but trying — quite successfully — 
to convince the world of sociology’s importance.
Durkheim was born in France in 1858, studied philosophy and social theory, 
and ultimately founded the first European department of sociology. His life 
had much less excitement than Marx’s, but he was full of new and provoca-
tive ideas about society.
Durkheim’s view of society
Compared to Marx, Durkheim had a fundamentally different — and much 
more positive view — of society. Reading Marx, you almost get the impres-
sion that he thinks we’d all be better off on our own, living by the work of our 
own hands. Marx appreciated the fact that working together in organized set-
tings allowed us to produce magnificent things (like, say, indoor plumbing) 
that we couldn’t create as individuals, but in general Marx thought people 
were apt to stab each other in the back if given the opportunity, so he was 
generally suspicious of society.
For Durkheim, humans are fundamentally social. In fact, thought Durkheim, 
our social life — at home, work, play, and worship — is what defines us, what 
gives us meaning and purpose. It’s what makes us truly human, and that fact 
is what makes sociology — the study of society — so important.
In his book The Rules of Sociological Method, Durkheim set out his vision of 
what sociology is and how it should be done. Specifically, he said that the 
job of the sociologist is to study social facts: facts that are true of groups of 
people rather than individuals. Here are a few examples of social facts:
 
✓ Australia is a democracy.
 
✓ Thirty-four percent of men have beards.
 
✓ The average income of a Porsche owner is $104,000.
Those are facts about groups of people, and though they don’t tell you any-
thing about any one individual — for example, whether any given man will 
have a beard, or the income of a particular Porsche owner — they tell you 
something specific about a group of people, who might then be compared 
to other groups (for example, Toyota Camry owners). Those are the facts 
Durkheim thought sociologists should take as their special area of concern.
Durkheim agreed with Marx that society was changing, but rather than a 
growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots, Durkheim thought that 
we were becoming more differentiated from one another in all kinds of ways. 

51
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
Earlier in history, when society was relatively simple, there were just a few 
different jobs people performed: hunter, gatherer, farmer, priest. Now, there 
are thousands of different jobs that need doing, and they’re very different 
from one another: software engineer, preschool teacher, forklift operator, 
screenwriter. This functional differentiation, thought Durkheim, was both 
necessary and — in broad terms — a good thing. Our shared social values 
help us work together productively and, for the most part, peacefully.
Sociology to die for
To prove the usefulness of sociology as a discipline, Durkheim chose to 
study a topic that would seem deeply personal, much more the domain of the 
psychologist or philosopher than the sociologist: suicide. By demonstrating 
that sociology could help us understand something so intensely private and 
individual, Durkheim showed the power of his newly invented sociological 
method.
In his book Suicide, Durkheim pointed out that though any individual person’s 
decision to commit suicide was, of course, personal — a person’s reasons for 
taking his or her life may be completely unknowable — in aggregate, suicides 
seem to have shared social causes. Durkheim observed that predictably, 
year in and year out, some countries have higher suicide rates than others. 
Whatever combination of factors cause people to commit suicide, they 
seemed to be greater in Sweden than in Spain; further, they were greater 
among unmarried people than married people, and greater among men 
than women. Putting aside the question of any one individual’s motivation, 
Durkheim said that a group’s suicide rate is a social fact that ought to be 
explained by other social facts.
In a pioneering use of social statistics, Durkheim gathered lots of numbers 
summarizing the suicide rates and other characteristics of many groups 
and lined them up in tables to see which social facts seemed to be related 
(see Chapter 4 for more on the use of statistics in sociology today). In the 
end, Durkheim concluded that there were actually different types of suicide 
that tended to happen for different reasons. For example, egoistic suicides 
were more frequent in groups with weak social ties (for example, countries 
with religious values emphasizing individualism) and altruistic suicides were 
more frequent in groups with extremely strong social ties (for example, the 
military).
The specifics of Durkheim’s study are less important than the way he went 
about doing it: defining and explaining social facts about groups. Explaining an 
individual’s behavior, according to Durkheim, is a different thing than explain-
ing a group’s behavior. Whether or not Durkheim’s conclusions about suicide 
were correct, he was right to point out that understanding why one Spaniard 
committed suicide (a matter of psychology) doesn’t tell us anything about 
why Spaniards in general committed suicide at a lower rate than Swedes; 
and understanding the causes of Spain’s suicide rate (a matter of sociology) 
doesn’t tell us anything about why any one Spaniard committed suicide.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
Max Weber
Marx and Durkheim are easy to compare and contrast because their views 
about what matters in society were so strikingly different. Marx thought it 
was all about conflict; Durkheim thought it was all about cooperation. Marx 
was concerned with the material world; Durkheim was concerned with the 
world of ideas and values. Max Weber (pronounced VAY-ber if you want to 
say it the way he did) is much harder to pigeonhole because for Weber it was 
not such an either/or question. If they had to choose which of the three great 
sociological thinkers was most “right,” most sociologists today would say 
Weber because Weber appreciated that social life is marked by both conflict 
and cohesion. Sometimes we fight, sometimes we get along; the trick is to 
understand why and when.
Great sociology from a troubled marriage
Max Weber’s best-known book is called The 
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. 
It contains Weber’s argument that the values 
spread by Protestant theologians like John 
Calvin were very influential in Europe’s transi-
tion from traditional society to modern capital-
ism. Essentially, Calvin and other Protestant 
theologians argued for the values of hard work, 
discipline, and savings. The belief that time is 
money, and money is good (because an abun-
dance of it suggests that God favors you partic-
ularly) is foundational to the capitalist economy.
It’s a brilliant sociological argument, and its 
core insight — the connection between a rig-
orous religious worldview and the capitalist 
economic system — may have been partially 
inspired by the troubled marriage of Weber’s 
parents. Weber’s mother was devoutly reli-
gious, a strong believer in the moral value 
of self-sacrifice, strict discipline, and hard 
work. Weber’s father, on the other hand, was 
a worldly, wealthy man who unapologetically 
enjoyed the luxuries his money could buy.
Weber’s work addressed this paradox: that 
modern life has some of the ascetic self-
discipline of the monk — you must be at your 
desk from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., fulfilling a precise list 
of duties — and yet it has afforded us luxuries 
and freedoms unimaginable to people who lived 
in the pre-modern era. It may be dehumanizing 
to work in exchange for money rather than to 
work growing food for your family, but now 
you have money that you can spend on what-
ever you want: maybe food, maybe a vacation, 
maybe a rubber chicken. Whatever!
In The Protestant Ethic, Weber tells the story 
of a landowner who hires some farmers to 
work his land. To motivate the farmers to work 
harder, the landowner increases the amount 
he pays per acre mowed; however, the land-
owner discovers, to his astonished frustration, 
that the farmers then proceed to work less hard 
because they only want to make enough to live 
on and after their “raise,” it takes less work 
to do it. If we all behaved that way, capitalism 
would never work. We’re the “good” farmers 
who work harder for greater financial reward — 
but to what end? Even Calvin believed that you 
can’t take it with you.

53
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
Max Weber was another German, and unlike Marx he largely stayed there, 
teaching at Freiburg and Heidelberg; in 1919, he founded the first German 
department of sociology. Despite some serious mental health issues (he suf-
fered from what were then called “nervous collapses”) and a troubled per-
sonal life (he married his second cousin, and while that made them kissing 
cousins, they probably didn’t do much more than that), he had an amazing 
work ethic. By the time of his death in 1920, he’d written many important 
books and articles that, as with Marx, took decades to be translated and pub-
lished for the benefit of a global audience.
Both Marx and Durkheim had grand views of history; they both presented the 
march of history as more or less inevitable. For Marx, class conflicts had inev-
itably led to capitalism and would inevitably lead, in the end, to communism. 
For Durkheim, developing technology and growing population had inevitably 
led to functional differentiation. For Weber, history was more like a game of 
Clue: We know how society turned out, but it takes some detective work to 
figure out who made it turn out that way, and when, and how. None of those 
answers can be taken for granted.
So how did society turn out? According to Weber, modern society is marked 
by rationalization: Most things are organized according to standard rules and 
systems that are meant to apply to everyone, with society meant to run like 
a well-oiled machine. In your job, for example, you don’t have the responsi-
bilities you have and get paid the amount you do just because you’re you — 
those things go with the job, and if you quit, the next person to take your job 
would perform the same tasks and get paid the same amount.
This is exactly the capitalist system that got Marx so riled up, and although 
Weber didn’t quite share Marx’s desire to overturn the whole system, it did 
make Weber a little uneasy. He referred to modern society as an “iron cage,” 
where for better and for worse we’re locked into well-defined roles.
And how did we get here? The development of rationalized industrial capi-
talism wasn’t inevitable, said Weber, pointing out that Europe had taken 
that path whereas other societies that had been around even longer —for 
example, China — had not. The development of a set of religious values 
(specifically, Calvinist Protestant values) that promoted hard work and sav-
ings had worked, said Weber, like a “switchman on the tracks” to ensure that 
European society would turn in that direction — and when the train went 
down that track, there was no going back.
Sociology in the 20th Century
In the first years of the 20th century, Durkheim was still trying to make the 
case for why a discipline called “sociology” needed to exist; today, sociology 
is one of the biggest and most frequently-studied subjects at colleges and 

54
Part I: The Basic Basics 
universities around the world. As I explain in Chapter 2, sociologists do 
important work in a wide range of jobs.
Sociology was born in Europe, but much of its explosive growth in the 20th 
century happened in the United States. In this section, I highlight the most 
important events fueling that growth.
Taking it to the streets: 
The Chicago School 
The first sociology department in the United States was founded at the 
University of Chicago in 1892. That department became home to several of 
the most important sociologists of the early 20th century, whose arguments 
and studies are collectively known today as the Chicago School of sociology. 
(“School” being used in the sense of “a school of thought.”)
The concerns of the Chicago School were strongly influenced by the fact that 
the University of Chicago is an unmistakably urban campus, located near 
south Chicago neighborhoods that were — and remain today — dense and 
diverse, with people from all walks of life interacting at close range. It’s not 
the wealthiest section of town, and those neighborhoods also have more 
than their share of conflict and crime.
If you’ve found yourself thinking that sociologists like Marx and Weber, with 
their grand arguments about the sweeping forces of history, were getting a 
little out of touch with the reality of everyday life, you’re not alone! The mem-
bers of the Chicago School urged their students to close their books, get out 
of the classroom, and plunge right into the social Petri dish they were sitting 
right in the middle of. They emphasized the importance of on-the-ground 
research methods like ethnography and participant observation (see Chapter 4 
for more on these methods). Although Durkheim dismissed individuals as 
outside sociology’s area of concern, sociologists in the Chicago School — 
and in America generally — preferred to study society from the bottom up, 
from the perspective of the individual in society.
Chicago, similar to the rest of America, was in the midst of a massive wave of 
immigration, and the Chicago sociologists saw people from completely dif-
ferent social backgrounds learning to interact together. Besides putting race, 
ethnicity, and immigration among the top concerns of American sociologists 
(as you may have noticed, those subjects weren’t at the top of most European 
sociologists’ research agendas) the sociologists of the Chicago School popular-
ized the study of symbolic interactionism — the study of the way individuals 
interact through a (more or less) shared understanding of words, gestures, and 
other symbols. (See Chapter 6 for more on symbolic interactionism.)

55
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
Mass society: Are we, or 
are we not, sheep?
In 1954, for the first time ever (and, so far, the only time ever), a sociolo-
gist made the cover of Time magazine: David Riesman, author of The Lonely 
Crowd. Although Riesman taught at the University of Chicago, he wasn’t a 
member of the Chicago School. His focus was on the big picture.
In The Lonely Crowd, Riesman argued that Americans had lost their inner 
compasses and become “other-directed” — in other words, instead of follow-
ing their own moral values, they just did whatever everyone else was doing. 
This is still a concern often voiced about America (and other countries) 
today, and it particularly resonated in the Ozzie and Harriet era, when it 
seemed like everyone was moving to the newly-built suburbs to buy a house 
that looked just like every other house on the block and have the same 2.2 
children as every other family on the block.
Riesman’s compelling book introduced sociology to an unprecedented popu-
lar audience — it remains the all-time bestseller in sociology. But among aca-
demics, Riesman’s influence was not as great as that of a man named Talcott 
Parsons. Parsons shared Riesman’s interest in mass society, but unlike 
Riesman, Parsons thought that it was by and large a good thing.
Parsons was a great believer in Durkheim’s view of society, and espoused a 
view of society that is known as functionalism. In functionalism, social phe-
nomena are explained by reference to the purpose they serve: If a certain 
phenomenon, such as education or religion, is observed in many different 
societies, it must be there for a reason. It must do something for society, or it 
wouldn’t exist. (If this sounds a lot like biological evolution, that’s no coinci-
dence. See Chapter 2 for a description of Durkheim’s “organic metaphor.”)
Parsons was one of the most ambitious sociologists of all time. He believed 
that the social sciences should be united instead of separate, and with 
like-minded colleagues in anthropology and psychology, he co-founded a 
Department of Social Relations at Harvard to bring the disciplines together. 
His 1951 book Toward a General Theory of Action was his manifesto, a 500-
page attempt to Explain It All.
Parsons’s theory was outrageously elaborate, and for years many sociolo-
gists in America and abroad were occupied trying to explain everything from 
business to politics to popular entertainment on Parsons’s terms. For a while, 
it almost seemed like Parsons was realizing Comte’s dream of creating a kind 
of owner’s manual for society.

56
Part I: The Basic Basics 
The Power Elite: Marx’s revenge
If the Chicago School had brought sociology down to earth, Parsons brought 
it right back up into the theoretical stratosphere, with everything explained 
from the sociologist’s perch on high. In fact, Harvard built Parsons a literal 
ivory tower — William James Hall, which still stands today — to house his 
multidisciplinary Department of Social Relations. Parsons’s quest for a grand 
unified theory of society hit the rocks, though, as an increasing number of 
sociologists criticized his theory.
Though functionalism is still an appealing way to think about society, most 
sociologists today think Parsons was misled in seeking to explain social fea-
tures by way of their functions. Although social institutions such as govern-
ment and education may be necessary because of the tasks they perform, 
sociologists today recognize that social institutions are created by people, 
not by functions — and although people may have society’s interests in mind, 
they also have their own personal motivations. Plus, even when people do act 
“for the good of society,” they’re often mistaken in the choices they make.
Because of his belief in social evolution — in other words, survival of the 
fittest societies — Parsons became a defender of the status quo. There was 
no country more advanced or more powerful than the United States; in fact, 
Parsons said, the United States was close to the ideal of social organization.
One sociologist, C. Wright Mills, thought this was completely wrong. 
Reminding his readers and students that the whole reason sociology was 
founded was to change society, Mills pointed out that society was still rife 
with social problems such as poverty, crime, racism, and to say these things 
were “necessary” or even “normal” was absurd. In his book The Power Elite 
(another bestseller of sociology), Mills argued that society was run by a small 
group of wealthy, powerful individuals who basically arranged things for 
their own benefit.
Sound familiar? If Parsons was a Durkheimian, Mills was a resolute Marxist. The 
debate between the two — which unfortunately ended with Mills’s untimely 
death in 1962 — was fiery and fascinating. Both were brilliant thinkers, but 
they represented completely different approaches to understanding society.
Mills mocked Parsons outright, saying that not only were Parsons’s ideas 
wrong, they were stated in ridiculously convoluted language that was almost 
incomprehensible to anyone who wasn’t intimately familiar with Parsons’s 
complex theory. Parsons fired back that Mills himself was empirically wrong, 
that there was no such thing as a unified “power elite” that somehow secretly 
conspired to run the world. Someone had to be in charge, said Parsons, and 
he pointed out that political, economic, and cultural leaders often had differ-
ent agendas that conflicted with one another.

57
 Chapter 3: Making It Up as They Went Along: The History of Sociology
Neither Parsons nor Mills “won” the debate — most sociologists today con-
sider themselves neither functionalist nor Marxist — but Mills re-injected 
sociology with some of the sense of purpose and populism that had marked 
its founding.
 
When you read sociological books and articles, look out for sociologists who 
use convoluted language. C. Wright Mills criticized Talcott Parsons for writing 
sentences like, “Coordinate with the importance of order as formulated in the 
hierarchy of control and the place of normative culture in action systems, is 
the pattern of temporal order imposed by the functional exigencies of sys-
tems.” Just because a concept is challenging doesn’t mean it has to be written 
The Cold War and the “sociology gap”
Few social thinkers have had the real-world 
impact of Karl Marx. Marx’s ideas about the 
evils of capitalism and the redistribution of 
wealth have inspired political revolutionaries 
including Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, and 
Fidel Castro, thus shaping the lives of billions 
of people in the communist societies they 
founded.
From 1922 to 1991, several Asian republics were 
incorporated as the Soviet Union, a commu-
nist nation that became a powerful rival to the 
United States and its allies. In the decades fol-
lowing World War II, the United States and the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) 
waged a “Cold War” in which they battled 
for economic and military dominance. Stanley 
Kubrick’s classic movie, Dr. Strangelove, sati-
rizes the panic that characterized that era, with 
characters taking the real-world concern over 
a “missile gap” (one country having signifi-
cantly more warheads than the other) to absurd 
levels, worrying about a “mineshaft gap” (a gap 
in provisions to protect citizens underground) 
and a “doomsday gap” (one country having a 
doomsday machine and the other not).
It’s not a coincidence that the Cold War era 
saw a boom in popular interest in sociology. 
Though it was known that the Soviet Union was 
a repressive regime that severely limited cer-
tain of its citizens’ freedoms, the U.S.S.R. was 
a huge and powerful country organized along 
fundamentally different principles than Western 
democracies. Though most Americans were 
staunchly opposed to any adoption of social-
ist policies — in fact, citizens who had even so 
much as attended meetings of the Communist 
Party were persecuted as “un-American” — 
many became uneasy about the American way 
of life.
Russians were known (accurately or not) for 
adhering to a rigorous work ethic and put-
ting their country ahead of themselves; had 
Americans grown lazy and complacent in the 
prosperous 1950s? Had Americans lost the 
drive, vigor, and individual initiative that had 
made their country great? It was these con-
cerns that helped pique average Americans’ 
interest in books like David Riesman’s The 
Lonely Crowd and William H. Whyte’s The 
Organization Man, both of which argued that 
American society had become marked by a 
mindless conformity. Both books — especially 
Riesman’s — are still widely-read today.

sociological books and articles.
Sociology Today
No individual or institution today dominates sociology as completely as the 
Chicago School did in the early 20th century or as Talcott Parsons did in the 
mid-20th century. Most sociologists today take inspiration from a range of dif-
ferent thinkers, and most are more concerned with answering specific empiri-
cal questions than formulating or testing grand theories about society.
Robert K. Merton was a sociologist who appreciated Parsons’s insights — 
Parsons was one of Merton’s advisors in graduate school — but thought that 
sociologists would do well to focus on smaller, solvable problems rather than 
trying to explain everything at once. Merton argued that sociologists should 
focus on “theories of the middle range” — that is, that sociologists should 
ask questions they can actually answer. So instead of asking “Why does edu-
cation exist?” a sociologist might ask, “How does education in this particular 
country serve to make people more equal — or less equal — in wealth?” 
That’s still a huge question, but it’s much easier to answer than a grand 
abstract question about the nature of society. There are still sociologists who 
pursue grand theories, but that tends to be an exercise for experienced soci-
ologists who’ve earned tenure and have time to write fat books.
Although Parsons’s dream of the unity of the social sciences hasn’t been 
achieved — sociologists still talk mostly to sociologists, psychologists still 
talk mostly to psychologists, and so on — sociologists in recent decades 
have increasingly collaborated with scholars from other disciplines to share 
knowledge and theory. Sociologists work with physicians to study the spread 
of disease, with businesspeople and economists to study corporate organiza-
tion, with psychologists to study small-group interaction, and with anthro-
pologists to study cultural change.
Besides enjoying the accumulated wisdom of all the sociologists mentioned 
here and many, many more, sociologists today also have the benefit of access 
to data and analytical tools that are light years beyond what was available 
to sociologists just a few decades ago. Huge sets of survey data are publicly 
available, and with the right software, any personal computer has the capac-
ity to perform highly sophisticated statistical analyses.
In Chapter 16 I have more to say about the future of sociology. For now, suf-
fice it to say that though answering sociological questions has become a lot 
easier since the time of Comte, asking the right ones is just as tricky as it has 
always been.

S
o what happens when the rubber meets the road? How do sociologists 
actually go about devising and conducting research studies? It’s impor-
tant for you to know how sociological knowledge is created even if you never 
intend to conduct your own research study. The scientific process of con-
ducting, evaluating, and building on empirical research is at the core of soci-
ology. Without empirical research, sociology would just be a lot of theories 
that may or may not be true.
In some ways, as I mention in Chapter 2, the sociological research process 
is similar to the research process in any other scientific discipline, including 
the natural sciences. (When I was a graduate student in sociology, Professor 
Barbara Reskin used to wear a white lab coat just to make the point that soci-
ologists are “real” scientists, too.) In other ways, though, it’s very different. 
Society is enormously complex and constantly changing, so making generaliz-
able statements about the way society works is a tricky matter that requires 
precise thinking and careful research methods.
In this chapter, I explain both the basic steps of sociological research and the 
methodological choices sociologists have to face when figuring out how to 
answer their sociological questions. I also outline the analytical tools avail-
able to sociologists and highlight some of the many things that can go wrong 
in the complex process of gathering and interpreting sociological data.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
The Steps of Sociological Research
In this section, I run through the essentials of conducting sociological 
research. How do you turn a general question about society into data that 
may be interesting and useful to others — in sociology and beyond? Although 
there are a large number of different methods and approaches used in socio-
logical research, the basic process I outline in the following sections is nearly 
universal.
 
You can’t put society in a test tube — you normally can’t conduct experi-
ments in sociology like you can in chemistry, physics, or even psychology. 
Sociological studies almost always consist of observing people in the “real 
world” rather than the laboratory.
Ask your question
Sociologists sometimes envy scientists who work in disciplines — like, say, 
astrophysics — where the phenomena being studied are so far removed from 
everyday life that laymen have a hard time even understanding what they do. 
That’s not an issue for sociologists who study phenomena that a lot of people 
give quite a bit of thought to: social inequality, social networks, the organiza-
tion of social groups such as corporations or clubs. When a sociologist talks 
about their work, sometimes it seems like everyone has an opinion.
Frustrating as that may sometimes be, it’s also what makes sociology excit-
ing. Sociological studies begin with a hunch about the social world, a sociolo-
gist’s idea about how a certain process might work, or a question about why 
people seem to behave in a certain manner. Here are a few questions that led 
to actual sociological studies:
 
✓ Why is the sport of cricket, which British colonists taught to natives of the 
lands they colonized, most popular in places like India and Africa, where 
the relatively recent colonial era was characterized by violent conflicts? 
Shouldn’t people in those countries have the least interest in playing a 
quintessentially British sport? (Jason Kaufman and Orlando Patterson)
 
✓ Why do companies consistently pay so much money to hire charismatic 
CEOs who seem to do little or nothing to raise those companies’ profits? 
(Rakesh Khurana)
 
✓ When people stop on the street to talk to each other, why do they stand 
right in the middle of the sidewalk, where they’re in everyone’s way? 
(William H. Whyte)
 
✓ Why are people in wealthy neighborhoods more likely than people in 
working-class neighborhoods to hang abstract art in their living rooms? 
And do they care if it matches the couch? (David Halle)

61
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
For ordinary people, these are questions that may come up around the water 
cooler at work or over the backyard fence, conversations that may conclude 
with a shrug. But for sociologists, these are empirical questions that can 
actually be answered.
Next time you’re curious about something in the social world, think: is 
there an empirical question here? Am I just trying to decide how I feel about 
something — or am I actually curious about how something works? Is there 
any information that could be gathered to answer my question? Sociological 
questions are questions about how the world works. A sociologist may not 
agree with the values or decisions of the people they study, but they are 
curious about those values and why people make the decisions they do.
After you have your question in mind, you likely have a hypothesis: a guess 
about what the answer is. This hypothesis, whether you realize it or not, 
rests on a theory about how the world works. Whether or not your theory 
is supported depends on whether or not your hypothesis proves to be 
correct.
Check the literature
When sociologists have an interesting question worth pursuing, they head to 
the shelves (or, more often, the Internet) to see what has been published in 
“the literature” that may be relevant to their question. When sociologists and 
other scientists talk about “the literature,” they usually don’t mean Moby Dick 
and The Brothers Karamazov. They mean the peer-reviewed scientific litera-
ture in their discipline.
 
For a scientific study to be peer reviewed means that it’s evaluated by other 
scholars who are experts in the area being studied. 
In sociology, peer-reviewed publications include:
 
✓ General sociology journals: Journals such as the American Sociological 
Review and the American Journal of Sociology contain studies so impor-
tant that they’re worth the attention of all sociologists.
 
✓ Field-specific journals: In sociology there are hundreds of journals such 
as New Media and Society or Sociology of Education intended primarily 
for scholars studying those specific subjects.
 
✓ Books: Sociologists also sometimes publish books, which are peer-
reviewed if they come from an academic press.
Reviewing the literature lets you learn from other sociologists’ work and 
avoid merely repeating what someone else has already done. 

62
Part I: The Basic Basics 
But which books and journal articles should you read? There are thousands 
and thousands of books and articles — and sometimes work that is not peer-
reviewed or labeled as “sociology” can also be important to your research. 
Sociologists normally search the literature for all these types of material:
 
✓ Sociological studies specifically on the topic they’re interested in 
researching. (For example, if you’re interested in studying political par-
ties in Kenya, look for other sociological studies of political parties in 
Kenya.)
 
✓ Sociological studies on similar topics. (In this example, look at sociologi-
cal studies of political parties in other African nations, or even political 
parties in other countries around the world.)
 
✓ Sociological studies using methods or approaches that may be useful. 
(For example, if you want to use a specific type of statistical technique 
or interview strategy, look at other studies using that same method.)
 
✓ Articles or books not in the sociological literature that are nonethe-
less informative about the topic at hand. (In this example, look at news 
reports on Kenyan politics, a book on the political history of Kenya, or 
relevant articles in political science or African studies.)
 
It’s always a possibility that you’ll discover someone’s “scooped” you — has 
already conducted the study you were interested in conducting. Much more 
often, though, you might discover that other scholars have studied your 
topic but that a lot of questions about the topic still remain unanswered. You 
then have to decide whether you have the information and/or resources to 
answer them.
Operationalize your question 
and find your data
The word “operationalize” sounds like something meaningless that you’d say 
to try to impress your boss in a meeting — but if your boss is a sociologist 
you actually will impress them because the word describes one of the most 
difficult and most important aspects of sociological research.
As I explain in Chapter 2, what distinguishes an empirical sociological question 
from a theoretical question or a moral question is that you can actually find 
an answer to it — but that doesn’t mean finding an answer is easy! To opera-
tionalize a question means to turn it from a general question (for example, are 
fans equally supportive, or critical, at men’s sports and women’s sports?) to 
a specific question that you can actually find an answer to (for example, how 
many audible player criticisms per fan are heard at each of 20 men’s basketball 
games, and how many at each of 20 women’s basketball games?).

63
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
The word data refers to pieces of information (one datum; multiple data). In a 
perfect world, you’d operationalize your question and then go right out and 
grab the data you need to answer your question. But we don’t live in a per-
fect world, and what happens more often is that you find the best data avail-
able and then operationalize your question as precisely as the data allow.
Here’s a real-life example from my own research. A colleague and I were curi-
ous about which subjects had become more frequently studied in universities 
around the world over the past century. But what data were available? We 
couldn’t find much information on universities’ budgets, so we didn’t know 
how much was spent on, say, the study of law in any given year. The United 
Nations had collected some data on student enrollments, but it didn’t go back 
very many years — and anyway, some other researchers were already looking 
at those data. What we did have were lists of faculty members at universities 
around the world, stretching back to the beginning of the 20th century!
So our general question was
Which subjects have become more frequently studied in universities 
around the world since 1900? 
Our data were lists of faculty members at universities around the world. We 
thus were able to operationalize our question as
Which subjects have seen the most growth in the number of faculty mem-
bers studying them since 1900?
After we found useful data and operationalized our question, it was easy to 
find an answer: We just started counting!
Finding data sounds like the most boring part of sociological research, but 
it can be one of the most creative. There are several big surveys available to 
the public (the U.S. census, the General Social Survey, the National Education 
Longitudinal Study); they make for high-quality data, but for exactly that 
reason they’re very often used in sociological studies, and it can be difficult 
to squeeze new information out of them.
Collecting original data is time-consuming and can be expensive, but it makes 
your study automatically interesting, even for readers who don’t agree with 
your analysis of your data. Here are just a few sources of original data:
 
✓ Data gathered for other purposes and not yet used for sociological 
analysis: You might use corporate records, public government records, 
and historical records, for example.
 
✓ Newspapers and magazines: You might search for articles document-
ing some kind of activity or showing people’s perspectives on the social 
world.

64
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
✓ Original surveys: You might conduct your own survey, trying to capture 
as many respondents as possible for a few key questions.
 
✓ Original interviews and ethnography: You might gather qualitative 
data by talking with or observing people.
(Later in this chapter, I provide more information on specific types of data 
and analysis.) After you have operationalized your question and gathered 
your data, you’re ready to begin your analysis!
 
As you operationalize your question, you need to be sure you’ve done so in a 
valid way. In other words, your data need to actually be relevant to the origi-
nal question you asked. If you’re not careful about this, you could end up with 
a data/theory mismatch. (More on that in the last chapter of this section.)
Analyze your data
Some empirical questions require data to answer, but don’t really need much 
analysis. Imagine you want to know whether you remembered to let the dog 
in. That’s an empirical question: The dog is either in or out. For data, you 
open the door and look out in the yard. Either you see the dog, or you don’t. 
There’s the answer to that particular empirical question.
Sociological questions, though, usually aren’t quite so easy to answer — even 
after you’ve found data and operationalized your question. What you usually 
end up with is hundreds of pages of interviews or a massive spreadsheet of 
survey data. It would be nice if you could just open the spreadsheet, look at 
its thousands upon thousands of cells worth of numbers, and say, “A-ha! I see 
that gender discrimination remains severe in higher-paying jobs whereas it 
has lessened somewhat in lower-paying jobs!” Unfortunately, it doesn’t really 
work that way.
Later sections in this chapter cover specific analytical methods in more 
detail; for now, I’ll just say that in almost all cases, you’re going to need to 
analyze your data to find an answer to your question. If you’ve found useful 
data and operationalized your question in a valid way, then the answer is 
there . . . you just need to get at it. Not only is this an essential step, but it’s a 
step where you need to be especially conscious and responsible because it’s 
going to be much easier for people reading your research report to spot an 
error in your interpretation than in your analysis.
Interpret your results
Okay, you’ve found your data, operationalized your question, and conducted 
your analysis. You have your results: a trend on a graph, or a repeated theme 
in interviews, or a number resulting from some statistical procedure. But 

65
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
what does it mean? Interpreting your results is the last step of sociological 
research. It means thinking about what you’ve learned and how it relates to 
the sociological literature. The trick is being honest with yourself — and your 
readers, if you’re hoping to publish your study — about exactly what your 
results say (or don’t say) about your topic.
You probably began your research process with a hypothesis: a guess about 
what the results of your study are. If your guess turns out to be correct, that 
supports your theory about why things were going to be that way. Depending 
on your question and your data, there’s probably still some room for doubt, 
but now at least now you have some important new information on the sub-
ject. Before presenting your results to your fellow sociologists, you want to 
be ready with your argument about what new light your results shed on the 
topic you’re researching.
Say you believe that the wage disparity between U.S. men and women has 
shrunk since 1950; that is, that men and women in the United States today 
make salaries that are more similar than the salaries of men and women 
in 1950. You find data on employee salaries at three big companies in New 
York City, and your analysis shows that sure enough, in 1950 women made 
an average of two-thirds as much money as men did whereas today women 
and men make almost the same amount of money. This result supports your 
hypothesis and provides sociologists with important new information about 
men’s and women’s salaries.
Every study needs some interpretation, but it’s particularly important in 
cases where the results are ambiguous. What if you find that women’s sala-
ries crept closer to men’s for 40 years, but in the past 20 years the disparity 
has been growing again? Does this support your hypothesis? Yes and no. 
If that is your result, you need to modify your theory. What happened to 
account for that change? You need to suggest a possible explanation.
If you’re confident in the validity of your data and analysis, you now know 
something you did not know before. But wait! How do you know that hap-
pened across the United States, not just in New York? You don’t know — and 
further, you have no idea what happened in other countries. To answer those 
questions, you have to — that’s right — gather more data. When you pres-
ent your research, you need to acknowledge this need for more data — but 
that doesn’t mean you’re just going back to square one! You can pat yourself 
on the back for finding important new information that helps inform sociolo-
gists’ understanding of gender and wages in the United States.
 
Nearly every sociological study ends with a call for further research. That’s 
just the way it works: the world is big, and sociologists will never know every-
thing there is know about it. To point to the need for further research is appro-
priately modest — you admit that your study doesn’t completely close the 
book on your topic — but it also highlights your achievement. In the previous 
example, sociologists needed to know what happened (whether or not the 
wage disparity has decreased) before they can ask how it happened.

66
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Choosing a Method
Getting an accurate picture of the social world is tricky business, especially 
because it’s a moving target! Society changes every day — usually not too 
quickly. Depending on the nature of your question and the resources available 
to you, you’ll have to make some fundamental decisions about what method-
ological strategy to use. In this section, I explain what those choices are.
Quantitative vs. qualitative
The most fundamental decision you have to make is whether your study is 
going to be a quantitative study or a qualitative study. Those words look simi-
lar, but they mean completely different things. A quantitative study is a study 
where data are gathered as, or translated into, numbers. A qualitative study is 
a study where data are gathered as words, narratives, and impressions that 
would lose their meaning or value if they were somehow turned into numbers.
When are sociological data too old?
When a colleague and I studied college attain-
ment, we were lucky to have a very large set of 
survey data collected by the U.S. Department 
of Education from 1988 to 1994. One day in 2007 
we received a call from a New York Times 
reporter who was writing an article about col-
lege attainment. She was very interested in our 
study — until she learned that our data con-
cerned students who had started college in 
1993. Things had changed too much since then, 
she thought, for our study to be of any interest 
to her readers.
And yet our study was published in a good soci-
ology journal. Are sociologists less concerned 
than journalists are in being accurate and 
up-to-date? Not at all! There are at least two 
reasons that sociologists found our 14-year-old 
data of interest when a journalist didn’t.
First, a journalist can write an article based on 
far less data than you typically need for a socio-
logical study. If I want to publish a newspaper 
article on college attainment, I can just sum-
marize the results of one or two recent stud-
ies, interview a couple of kids who are on their 
way to college this fall, and I’m done. But if I 
want to publish a sociological study of college 
attainment, I’ll need to do a lot more research. 
We couldn’t just call up 14,000 kids who were 
going to college in 2007, such as the govern-
ment did in the early 1990s. We would certainly 
have liked to, but a major survey like that can 
cost tens of thousands — even hundreds of 
thousands — of dollars.
Also, as I note in Chapter 2, sociologists are 
interested in the fundamental patterns of social 
interaction. Even in different social situations, 
sociologists believe general patterns of human 
interaction are fairly constant. That’s why a 
historical sociologist can study something that 
happened in the 1800s, or even in the 1200s, and 
discover that a large number of their colleagues 
are interested if the study is done well. Fourteen 
years? That’s nothing.

67
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
Quantitative analysis
In a quantitative study, data may be gathered as numbers. Some information 
about society exists as numbers already. For example:
 
✓ Annual income, in dollars
 
✓ Test scores
 
✓ Unemployment rates
Other information can be fairly easily translated into numbers. For example:
 
✓ Sex (1=female, 0=male . . . or vice-versa)
 
✓ Race or ethnicity (1=Latino, 0=non-Latino)
 
✓ Marital status (1=unmarried, 0=married)
Still other information is trickier to translate into numbers, but it’s possible 
to at least try. For example:
 
✓ Self-esteem (How happy are you with yourself? 2=very happy, 1=fairly 
happy, 0=unhappy)
 
✓ Cultural tastes (Have you been to a jazz concert in the last year? 1 if yes, 
0 if no)
 
✓ Social networks (Here is a list of people in your company; answer 1 for 
each person you consider a friend, answer 0 for each person you do not)
The benefit of quantitative research is that it allows you to consider many 
cases (people or countries or whatever you’re studying) because you don’t 
need to “get to know” each case — the important facts about each case are 
right there in the numbers. With statistical analysis, you can easily analyze a 
huge amount of information. (More on that in the next section.)
Qualitative analysis
In a qualitative study, data are gathered as statements, experiences, or 
impressions and are usually recorded as words. Examples of qualitative stud-
ies include:
 
✓ An interview study, where you conduct hour-long interviews with 50 
people and record their comments.
 
✓ An ethnography, where you spend weeks, months, or even years in a 
particular social setting and write about your experiences.
 
✓ Participant observation, where you join a group of people and make 
sociological observations even as you walk in your subjects’ shoes.

68
Part I: The Basic Basics 
 
✓ A historical study, where you read and research extensively about a 
particular place and time with an eye to particular features of the social 
environment.
The benefit of qualitative research is that it allows for a much more in-depth 
understanding of a situation. Because of the intense work involved, you can’t 
study as many cases as you can with a quantitative study — but you’re much 
less likely to miss something important about any given case.
Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal
Most sociological studies involve questions of causality. In other words, a 
sociologist asks whether or not one thing causes another. But when you 
aren’t taking people into a lab and conducting experiments on them, it can 
be very difficult to sort out what causes what. Certain research methods 
can make this easier — but at a price. In this section, I explain the difference 
between a cross-sectional study (where data are gathered at one point in 
time) and a longitudinal study (where data are gathered from multiple points 
in time). Longitudinal data allow sociologists to make more confident state-
ments about causality, but they can be difficult to gather.
Say you’re studying the effect of television on violence. Psychologists have 
the benefit of using a laboratory setting: If you take two groups of randomly 
selected people and have one group play violent video games while the other 
group play peaceful video games, and the first group gets more violent than 
the second, you have a good idea that the games caused the violence. But 
when studying people in the real world, sociologists can’t just drop video 
game systems into some houses and not others. If people who are more vio-
lent are also more likely to play violent video games, how do we know that 
the games made them violent — rather than that they chose to play violent 
games because of the violent nature they were born with? We don’t.
A cross-sectional study is the most common form of sociological study. In a 
cross-sectional study, data are gathered across multiple groups at one point 
in time. For example, you may visit 1,000 families from different socio-
economic backgrounds, see what media they have in their homes (video 
games, TVs, computers, stereos, and so forth), and ask about or observe 
their children’s behavior. From this information, you do your best to infer 
what the relationship might be between media use and children’s behavior. 
If families with violent games tend to have children who are more violent, 
regardless of other factors (family wealth, school quality, neighborhood), 
that looks incriminating for the games.

69
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
Even better would be to conduct a longitudinal study, where you follow a 
group of cases over time. For example, if you revisit those 1,000 families 
five years later, many aspects of their lives will have changed. Some of the 
families that did not have violent games five years ago will have bought them 
in the meantime, and you can observe whether that’s had an effect on their 
children’s behavior. If it has, that’s a much more convincing finding than a 
finding from cross-sectional data.
So why isn’t every sociological study a longitudinal study? Largely because of 
reasons of time, money, and access. It takes a lot of resources to conduct a 
sociological study, and conducting a longitudinal study takes at least twice as 
many resources — plus, of course, you have to wait around while people live 
their lives. (People can disappear in the meantime — see the final section of 
this chapter for a discussion of missing data.)
Hybrid methods
Increasingly, sociologists appreciate that the ideal is to use both qualita-
tive and quantitative, and both longitudinal and cross-sectional, methods to 
answer a question. Because no research method is perfect, you can cover 
your bases by using multiple methods.
For example, I used all these methods in my study of children’s media. My 
study had two main parts:
First, I tracked newspaper and magazine articles about children and 
media over time, assigning numerical codes to the articles to indicate 
which themes they addressed. That was a quantitative, longitudinal study: 
I retrospectively “followed” a number of publications over time, and 
translated their content into numbers on a spreadsheet.
Then, I sat down with teachers and parents at two schools — one urban 
and one suburban — to interview them about their views on children and 
media. That was a qualitative, cross-sectional study: I talked with people 
from two different social groups, and wrote about what they said without 
turning it into numbers.
That was a useful approach, but in the end I decided that the issues were just 
too complex to be distilled into numbers, and I presented a qualitative analysis 
rather than a quantitative analysis of the newspaper and magazine articles.
 
Conducting a sociological study is kind of like fixing a car: You’d better bring 
your whole toolbox because you don’t know ahead of time what (methodologi-
cal) tool is going to be the best one for the job.

70
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Analyzing Analytical Tools
Whether your data are quantitative or qualitative, cross-sectional or longi-
tudinal, you’re going to have a whopping task in front of you when you sit 
down to analyze them. Fortunately, social scientists — with help from natural 
scientists, mathematicians, and computer programmers — have developed 
some powerful tools. When used correctly, these analytical tools can lead to 
astonishing insights.
Statistics
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “I don’t want to become just another sta-
tistic.” It usually means that someone doesn’t want to have something bad 
happen that will add them to a tally of highway casualties, drug addicts, or 
other people in undesirable circumstances. In quantitative sociology, though, 
everyone is a statistic. Statistics aren’t just about tallying disasters; they’re 
about taking account of the full range of observed circumstances and helping 
to spot trends and patterns.
The statistical techniques most commonly used by sociologists (and other 
scientists) address a core problem: You want to know whether a given pat-
tern or trend is present in a very large population, but you can’t observe 
every single member of that population. You can observe a lot of members of 
that population and see whether a pattern or trend is present in that group 
you observe . . . but how sure can you be that your group is representative, 
that you aren’t just looking at a group that happens to be in some way pecu-
liar? That’s always a risk. If you have a bag with an equal number of black 
and white marbles, you might reach in and grab a handful of marbles that 
happen to be all white. That’s very improbable, but not impossible. Statistics 
can help to tell you just how improbable it is that the patterns you observe in 
your sample are representative of patterns in the total population.
 
A survey of a group you’re a member of isn’t automatically invalid just 
because you weren’t among those who were given the survey! Surveying just a 
few thousand members of a population will yield results that are very close to 
the results for the entire population, just as long as people surveyed are repre-
sentative of the population — that is, that they’re evenly selected from all 
parts of the population and there isn’t any one part that’s overrepresented or 
underrepresented.
Say you’re curious to know whether, in your country, boys drop out of high 
school more frequently than girls. You’re asking a question about every 
high school student in the country, but obviously you can’t gather data on 

71
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
every high school student in the country. You’ll have to make do with a 
sample of high school students.
Maybe you know that there were 15 boys and 15 girls in your freshman home-
room, and that by senior year 2 boys and 1 girl had dropped out of school. 
Should you then conclude that in your country, boys drop out of high school 
twice as often as girls? Of course not! That sample is way too small. So imag-
ine you find data on your entire school, and learn that of 354 boys and 373 
girls who started high school with you, 32 boys and 20 girls dropped out. 
Now you can be more confident that boys drop out more often than girls . . . 
but just how confident? Maybe you can find data on your whole school dis-
trict, and learn that of 4,909 boys and 5,012 girls who started freshman year, 
489 boys and 318 girls failed to graduate. Now you can be even more confi-
dent that if you were to look at all high schoolers in your country, you’d con-
sistently find boys dropping out in greater proportion than girls.
But where do you stop gathering data? When can you be confident enough? 
Here’s where statistics come in. A statistical test would tell you that if your 
district wide sample is representative, we can be 99.99 percent confident 
that, in fact, in the general population of high school students, boys drop out 
more often than girls. That’s pretty confident.
That’s just a very simple statistical test; programs that can be run on an ordi-
nary personal computer are capable of performing much more complex analy-
ses on huge sets of data. The general principle, though, remains: Statistical 
analyses tell you how confident you can be that a pattern you observe in 
your sample holds in a general population. You can never be 100 percent 
confident, but with a few thousand cases you can often be 90 percent, or 
even 99 percent, confident.
 
To be valid, statistical tests rely on a number of assumptions — and the more 
complex the tests get, the more assumptions they rely on. A crucial assump-
tion is that you’re testing a representative sample of the population. In the 
previous example, what if there’s something unusual about your school dis-
trict? What if it’s unusually wealthy, or unusually poor? If that’s the case (and 
it probably is), your district is not really representative of your country’s high 
schools. You would need to take a broader sample, from a wide range of differ-
ent school districts, to get a representative sample. The thing to remember — 
about this example and about sociological studies generally — is that if you 
don’t have a representative sample, your statistics program doesn’t know that. It 
will happily carry on applying tests and reporting results, trusting you to inter-
pret those results appropriately. See the next section for more on this prob-
lem and other things that can go wrong with sociological studies.

Part I: The Basic Basics 
Qualitative data
The upside of qualitative data is that they present a rich picture of the 
social world. In a quantitative study, you might ask someone a series of ten 
multiple-choice questions about their life; in a qualitative study, you might sit 
down with them and ask a few open-ended questions that they take an hour 
or more to answer. Obviously in the qualitative study you get to know your 
subjects a lot better — but the downside is that you’re left with dozens, hun-
dreds, or even thousands of pages of interview transcripts or field notes that 
you can’t just feed into a stats program for analysis.
There’s no real shortcut for analyzing qualitative data: You have to go over 
your notes carefully, multiple times, and take note of trends and patterns 
which you then present to readers or listeners, usually with representative 
quotes from your interviews or notes. Readers or listeners who doubt your 
analysis can ask to look at your original data and draw their own conclusions. 
(In fact, they rarely do.)
Bias and the body
Researchers in all fields, the social sciences 
in particular, need to be aware of the danger 
that their beliefs and expectations will bias 
their results. When you believe that something 
is true, you are more likely to pay attention to 
information that supports your belief than infor-
mation that contradicts it.
There’s no surefire way to avoid biased results, 
but working in a team can help to ensure that no 
individual researcher’s bias can dramatically 
affect the results. This was what I advised my 
student Kim to do when she proposed a study 
of women’s bodies as they appeared in adver-
tisements over several decades. Kim believed 
that a “fit,” muscular ideal for women’s bodies 
had come to replace the Barbie-style hourglass 
ideal of the 1950s, and she expected that the 
change would be reflected in women’s bodies 
as seen in magazine ads.
The problem, though, was in deciding just how 
muscular any given body was. Kim couldn’t test 
the muscle mass of a model in a Cosmo ad — 
she’d have to eyeball it. Of course Kim would try 
her best to accurately specify just how muscu-
lar (on a 1 to 5 scale) any given model was, but 
I was concerned that if Kim tried to publish her 
research, critics would say that she may have 
conveniently “seen” more muscle on models in 
later ads so as to support her hypothesis.
What to do? I advised Kim to enlist a classmate 
to serve as backup: Each ad was evaluated for 
“muscularity” by two people whose scores 
were then compared and averaged. Kim gave 
her classmate sample pictures of body types 
across the scale, so both Kim and her class-
mate could see what should count for a “2” in 
muscularity and what should count for a “5.” 
It turned out that Kim and her classmate were 
usually in close agreement on just how muscu-
lar any given model was, so Kim could present 
her results with confidence. (You may be won-
dering whether her hypothesis was supported. 
The answer is: yes!)

 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
Some computer programs are now available to help researchers analyze 
qualitative data. These programs can help tabulate uses of key words or 
phrases and let researchers highlight and tag themes to make it easier to see 
where and when they show up in the data. These programs can’t conduct 
your analysis for you, but they can help you work more quickly and effi-
ciently as well as help you to collaborate with colleagues who may be looking 
at the same data.
Preparing For Potential Pitfalls
It’s exciting when you look at your data and see a pattern you hadn’t 
expected, or realize that you have an eye-opening finding to share. But again, 
you need to be cautious lest you fall into one of these traps.
Data/theory mismatch
As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, in a perfect world you’d go out and 
gather precisely the data you need to answer your question. But in the 
imperfect world we actually inhabit, you often need to settle for the best data 
available. This creates the dangerous possibility of using inappropriate data: 
data that don’t actually answer your question. Your data (the information 
you gather) need to match your theory (the question you’re asking, and your 
hypothesis about it).
For example, when my colleague and I studied the effect of kids’ high 
school activities on college attainment, as our outcome we took a measure 
of whether or not kids enrolled in college. What if, instead, we had taken 
a measure of whether they had graduated from college? That would have 
been a data/theory mismatch because it would have missed all the kids who 
enrolled in college and then dropped out. Our question was whether or not 
the students had enrolled in college, and we had to be sure our data actually 
spoke to that question. What makes students more or less likely to graduate 
from college after they enroll is an interesting question — but it’s a different 
question from the one we were asking.
Getting overzealous
Statistical analysis can tell you how confident you can be that a pattern 
observed in your sample is typical of the general population — but that 
applies only to the general population of people like those you sampled, not 
necessarily the whole population of everyone in the whole wide world. It can 

74
Part I: The Basic Basics 
be tempting to suggest that your findings are relevant to a broader range of 
situations than you’ve actually observed — and often, in fact, they are! Still, 
you need to be cautious when it comes to telling the world what you’ve dis-
covered and what its significance is. You don’t want to overgeneralize.
Another danger is oversimplifying: presenting your findings as being simpler 
than they actually are. Often, the most interesting result of a study will be 
a kernel of data that jumps out of one of several regression analyses; you 
have a responsibility to explain to your readers and listeners that the effect 
you’ve discovered may vary depending on what analysis you conduct or the 
presence of a certain situation. If the wording of a survey question may have 
influenced respondents’ answers, you need to explain that. The world is a 
complicated place, and it’s okay to acknowledge that when you present the 
results of your study.
This is a valuable lesson you can take away from the study of sociology: If 
you take some time to look closely at sociological research findings, you’ll 
see that the research process that leads to a discovery is long and complex. 
Although this doesn’t make the discovery invalid — indeed, if a researcher is 
properly attentive to details and analyses, it makes the discovery especially 
valid — it does mean that any quick-and-dirty summary of the findings, such 
as you might find in the media, is bound to leave out important details.
For example, say you conduct a qualitative study of parents at an elementary 
school, and several of your respondents mention that they feel intimidated 
by the school staff and hesitant to call their children’s teachers to discuss 
concerns they have. You notice that the children of these parents, on aver-
age, earn unusually low grades given their standardized test scores. You also 
notice that of the several respondents who mention this, most are nonwhite. 
In your paper, you write:
These findings suggest that parents who vocally advocate for their 
children may reap a reward in terms of higher grades awarded to those 
children. The findings further suggest that this effect may particularly 
disadvantage minority children. Further research should focus on the 
content of parent-teacher conversations and the context in which they 
occur.
The journal in which you publish this research is excited by your finding, 
and they send a press release summarizing your work. Your research is then 
reported in a two-paragraph newspaper blurb with the headline sociologist: 
minority parents hurt their kids by refusing to grade-grub. That headline is 
not exactly inaccurate, but it seriously oversimplifies your findings. That 
kind of thing happens frequently in media coverage of scientific findings, and 
scientists sometimes play into it by presenting their work in such a way as to 
make their findings sound especially “sexy” — that is, intriguing and impor-
tant in a way that even a layman can understand. Responsible sociologists try 
to avoid this.

 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
The missing links
When you sit down to analyze a large data set, it may seem like you have way 
more data than you know what to do with. You may have a survey adminis-
tered to 10,000 respondents, each of whom answered 100 questions — giving 
you a million little pieces of data to sort and analyze! That’s a lot of data. 
Even so, there’s still a lot more you don’t know than you do know. That’s fine, 
but if you’re missing particularly relevant information, the conclusions you 
draw from your analyses may be flawed. The two major categories of missing 
information are missing data and missing variables.
Missing data
Statistical analyses depend on your having a truly random, representative 
sample of the population you’re studying; but that’s harder to achieve than 
it may seem. If your data over-represent any particular group, then your data 
don’t really tell you about the whole population.
Slipping up on shacking up
A data/theory mismatch may sound like an 
elementary mistake that can be easily avoided, 
but there have been examples of data/theory 
mismatches that have gone unnoticed for 
years, even in major studies that garner lots of 
attention.
Sociologist Felix Elwert was curious about 
the effect of cohabitation — living together as 
romantic partners — on marriage and divorce. 
He wasn’t the first one: Many sociologists had 
studied the topic, and several studies by differ-
ent sociologists had found that married couples 
who lived together before getting married were 
more likely to divorce than were couples who 
had not lived together before marrying. The 
conclusion? Cohabitation makes divorce more 
likely. Readers interpreted these studies to sug-
gest that if society didn’t make it acceptable to 
“shack up” without marrying, the divorce rate 
would go down.
But Elwert pointed out that there was a major 
data/theory mismatch in that conclusion. The 
studies, he pointed out, considered only cou-
ples who actually got married. What about all 
the couples who moved in together and later 
decided to break up, without ever having been 
married? If they had not been permitted to 
live together without marrying, some of them 
surely would have been married, and probably 
would have divorced . . . so it might actually 
be that “allowing” couples to cohabit made 
the divorce rate lower than it would have been 
otherwise!
Further, Elwert and others noticed, many of 
the studies had a mistaken assumption about 
causality. The data didn’t prove that cohabita-
tion caused divorce. How did the sociologists 
who conducted the studies know that there 
wasn’t something else — perhaps a risk-taking 
disposition — that caused couples to be 
both more likely to cohabit and more likely to 
divorce? Without more complete data, they 
could not know the answer to that question.

76
Part I: The Basic Basics 
Traditionally, surveys have been conducted by phone. Sociologists call a 
bunch of numbers pulled randomly from the phone book and record the 
responses they receive. This has never been a perfect method because 
often people aren’t home or, if they do answer the phone, they refuse to 
participate. As long as that happens only randomly, it’s fine — but what if it 
doesn’t? What if the people who are not home or refuse to participate tend 
to be relatively poor? That means that your data overrepresent the wealthier 
people in a society. Today, this problem is compounded by the problem that 
more and more people are trading their landlines for cell phones, which don’t 
appear in the phone book — so a sample of people who are home, have a 
phone, answer the phone, and agree to participate in a survey is looking less 
and less like a sample of the general population.
Then there is the problem of missing data on particular variables. What if 
someone takes a 100-question survey and refuses or forgets to answer 5 ques-
tions that figure in your analysis? Do you throw out that person’s response 
entirely? Do you try to guess what they might have answered, based on what 
other people like them answered? There’s no obvious answer as to the right 
way to handle that situation, but on many surveys, a huge fraction — even 
most — of the respondents have missing data on some variables, so it’s 
potentially a big problem.
Missing variables
This is even a trickier problem. What if there are important questions that 
you simply forget to ask people? Usually, you just don’t know. That may lead 
you to believe that something you do know is more important than it is in 
actuality.
For example, say you’re called in to consult for a company that wants to 
improve its employees’ reliability. The company gives you a large set of data 
on its employees: their work responsibilities, their salaries, their ages, their 
performance ratings . . . and how often each employee misses work. You 
run a multiple regression analysis on these data and discover that the most 
significant variable is age: The younger an employee is, the more often he or 
she misses work. You report this to the company, which assumes its younger 
employees are simply partying too much and instructs the human resources 
department to screen more carefully for serious-minded applicants.
But what don’t you know about those employees? You don’t know where 
they live or how they get to work. What if younger employees are less likely 
to own cars and more likely to rely on public transportation, which may be 
unreliable. How do you know that’s not the problem? You don’t, because 
information on transportation is simply missing from your analysis. Again, 
there’s no obvious way to avoid this problem — you need to be mindful of 
the possibility that there’s important information you don’t have, which may 
cause your analysis to suggest that some variables are more important than 
they actually are.

77
 Chapter 4: Research Methods: Because You Can’t Put Society in a Test Tube
Statistical snafus
Fortunately, expert statisticians have developed a range of sophisticated 
mathematical techniques for addressing these problems and others. 
Statistical analysis programs come loaded with so many features and tools 
that it can seem like magic. Missing data? No problem! Just use this exciting 
new imputation technique. Missing variables? Don’t worry! We have a reli-
ability analysis that you can use to assure your readers there’s no significant 
problem.
These techniques are indeed powerful, and in the hands of a knowledgeable 
statistician, they can help solve some very tricky problems. The risk comes 
for the many sociologists (and other scientists) who are less than expert in 
the use of statistics. Each of those techniques depends on certain assump-
tions being true and yields results that need to be carefully interpreted, and a 
sociologist with a less than perfect understanding of statistics may misuse or 
misinterpret them. If you misuse a statistical technique, your conclusions are 
off-base . . . but you don’t even know that they are!
How does this become a problem? Let’s say you’re an expert in the sociology 
of education, with working knowledge — but not expert knowledge — of sta-
tistics. You have a great data set that you really want to use, but you know 
private-school students are underrepresented in that data set. You mention 
this to a colleague, who says, “Oh, have you tried the Blahdeblah technique 
for solving that problem?” It sounds good to you, so you run your data 
through the Blahdeblah analysis on your statistics program, and it spits out 
some results that look intriguing. You write a paper about them and send it 
to a journal on the sociology of education. The editor sends it to two sociolo-
gists who are experts on education but not on statistics; they like your paper 
and just have to take your word that you’ve used the Blahdeblah technique 
correctly. They recommend your paper be published, and there you have it: 
a paper published in a peer-reviewed journal, based entirely on a technique 
that no one involved really understands. What if you misused that technique 
or misinterpreted your results? No one except a statistics expert would know, 
and they’re all busy reading statistics journals — not education journals.
 
How big a problem is this in sociology? Some statistical experts guess that the 
majority of all quantitative papers published in sociology journals contain sig-
nificant errors due to the misuse of statistics. It’s a serious problem.
Mistakes . . . just plain oops!
And then there are those mistakes that are just plain bloopers. If they happen 
“behind the scenes” of an analysis, they may go completely unnoticed unless 
someone decides to check and run the analysis for themselves.

78
Part I: The Basic Basics 
A notorious example of this concerned the 1994 book The Bell Curve, 
written by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Very controversially, 
Herrnstein and Murray argued that genetically inherited differences in intel-
ligence significantly disadvantage members of minority racial groups. This 
conclusion was so outrageously counterintuitive that social scientists looked 
very carefully at Herrnstein and Murray’s analyses. Could that really be what 
their data showed? The Bell Curve analyses were subjected to a level of scru-
tiny that very few studies ever receive.
In the end, many of Herrnstein and Murray’s analyses and conclusions were 
shown to be seriously flawed. Murray himself, re-examining the analyses, 
discovered that several people whose years of education were unknown 
(missing data) had accidentally been incorporated into the analyses as 
each having negative five years of education! (Which is, of course, impos-
sible. You can’t actually have fewer than zero years of education . . . but a 
statistical analysis program wouldn’t know that.) Um . . . oops! Needless 
to say, mistakes like that left Herrnstein and Murray with results that were 
highly dubious . . . but they might never have been discovered if the book’s 
conclusions hadn’t been so implausible.
So mistakes do happen, often. The research process is complicated, and 
there are a lot of things that can go wrong — but that doesn’t mean you 
ought to go around mistrusting everything a sociologist tells you! It means 
simply that you need to be aware that just because a conclusion happens 
to be backed by fancy statistics or comes from a sociologist at a prestigious 
university, the study is not necessarily flawless or infallible. In sociology as in 
everything else, there’s always room for improvement.

Par t II
Seeing Society 
Like a Sociologist

In this part . . .
O
ne of the great discoveries of sociology is that there 
are some common processes and similar challenges 
across a range of social phenomena. No matter what you 
study in society, you have to know what culture is (and 
what it isn’t), how to connect big social structures with 
everyday person-to-person interaction, and how to make 
sense of social networks. That’s what this part is all about.

Chapter 5
Socialization: What is “Culture,” 
and Where Can I Get Some?
In This Chapter
▶ Defining culture
▶ Separating the buyers from the sellers
▶ Understanding socialization
▶ Identifying culture and conflict
W
hen I say that people are in a society together, it generally means 
that they interact in some way, either directly with one another or by 
interacting with the same social institutions (the government, for example). It 
also means that they share a common culture.
In this chapter, I tell you what culture is and how sociologists study it. I 
explain how sociologists have developed strategies for studying everything 
from hip-hop music to fashion to first names to our deepest values and 
unquestioned assumptions about the world. I also explain how culture is 
spread, and how a person learns about culture from the first moment he or 
she opens his or her eyes and ears to the world. 
Understanding how this process works means understanding that you’re not 
born into a single culture, but actually into many cultures: the microculture 
of your family; the intersecting cultures of your neighborhood, church, and 
school; the broader cultures of your city, region, and country; and even the 
global culture shared, in some part, by nearly every single person on Earth.
Socialization is the process through which you learn this culture. Some 
socialization happens through the media and people you encounter at work 
and school, but the most important way you learn about culture — and your 
place in culture — is at home. I explain the concept of primary group as soci-
ologists use it, and as you can use it to understand your own socialization.

82
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Understanding What Culture 
Is — and Isn’t
Norms are commonly accepted expectations for behavior in a society; values 
are commonly shared ideas about what is important. When you think of the 
term culture, you likely envision shared ideas, norms, and values, all of which 
sociologists consider to be the broader sense of culture. However, when 
sociologists study those shared ideas, norms, and values, they often make a 
distinction between the following two categories:
 
✓ Culture: Ideas, norms, and values that may vary widely across a society.
 
✓ Structure: The fundamental organization of society into its institutions, 
groups, statuses, and roles. Members of a society tend to agree on the 
nature of that society’s structure.
Although the idea that the broad sense of “culture” has a subcategory called 
“culture” can be confusing, different sociologists handle the broad definition of 
culture in different ways. So breaking culture into two subsets — culture and 
structure — helps you understand the basic idea of how culture is studied. To 
help you understand the breakdown further, in the next sections I explain what 
culture and structure mean as well as how they may even overlap. 
 
Culture and structure — and the even broader sense of culture — don’t have 
hard-and-fast definitions. Understanding how they correlate to one another 
and how others might define them is essential to understanding sociological 
arguments.
Defining “culture”
In contrast to structure (for more on structure, check out the next section, 
“Breaking down structure”), sociologists define culture as ideas and values 
that change relatively quickly and that may vary widely within a single soci-
ety, neighborhood, or even family. People are allowed or even encouraged to 
hold these ideas and values for themselves, and those same ideas and values 
may change over their lives. 
You can define culture simply as shared understandings. Everything in your 
head that you somehow share with other people — whether you talk about it 
or not — might be considered culture. For example:

83
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
 
✓ Tastes in music, movies, books, and art: Do you prefer classical music 
or rock music? Who’s your favorite actor? Who’s your favorite author? 
(Records, movies, books, and paintings themselves are referred to as 
“cultural products.”)
 
✓ Religious views: Are you Catholic? Protestant? Muslim? Hindu? A Jew? 
Do you believe there is a holy text that should be read and followed?
 
✓ Political views: Are you a Republican, a Democrat, or neither? Do you 
think we should raise taxes or cut them?
 
✓ Moral values: Is it right or wrong to eat animals? What are people’s 
moral responsibilities to one another?
Although the average person doesn’t normally change political views or 
musical tastes every day, people can and do change these views without 
their everyday lives necessarily being affected very much.
Of course, if these elements of culture can change so easily and vary so 
widely, you may wonder if they even matter. Some sociologists say yes, 
absolutely, they make a huge difference; other sociologists say no, not really, 
they’re just window dressing. Even moral values, which are deeply important 
to each individual, don’t directly affect the overall organization of society. 
What everyone agrees on is the importance of structure. For more on the 
debate, see Chapter 3.
 
Adding to the potential confusion of understanding culture is the fact that 
sociologists sometimes draw a distinction between “real culture” and “ideal 
culture.” When those terms are used, ideal culture refers to the values that 
a society professes — for example, that college students shouldn’t drink 
alcohol — and real culture refers to the values that a society actually acts 
on — in this example, that drinking is generally understood to be a normal 
part of the college experience. Cultural values aren’t always consistent, 
even in the same society. 
Breaking down structure
In sociology, the word “structure” (or “social structure”) refers to the funda-
mental organization of society. The overall structure of your society deter-
mines what statuses are available and how easy (or difficult) it is to move 
from one status to another. Your status in the social structure determines 
what rights and responsibilities you have. 

84
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
As opposed to “culture,” things referred to as “structure” are things that 
people in the same society tend to agree on, things that form the fundamen-
tal organization of society. Members of a society share basic understandings 
about that society’s structure, and they can’t be easily changed without seri-
ously disrupting the entire society.
The foundations of social structure include:
 
✓ Technology: A technological change — for example, the invention of the 
automobile — can spur tremendous changes in the way we live and the 
culture we share. Technological changes may start small, but eventually 
come to affect everybody. Even if you don’t drive a car, cars affect your 
life every day. They cause problems (pollution, accidents) as well as 
help us get things done, but whatever happens in the future, they can’t 
be “uninvented.”
 
✓ The economy: When the economy is booming, there are many jobs and 
resources to share; when the economy is hurting, unemployment is high 
and everyone has to make do with less. You can debate what the best 
strategy for economic recovery is, but you can’t argue about the fact 
that unemployment is rising. Even the leader of a country can’t snap his 
or her fingers and turn a national economy around — the economy lies 
deep in our social structure and is difficult to change.
“Status” update
Status isn’t just something you update on 
Facebook. Status is a very important concept in 
sociology. A status is a place in the social struc-
ture. Because society today is very complex, 
each person has many statuses, all of which 
may have different implications in different situ-
ations. Here are just a few of my own statuses:
 ✓ Male
 ✓ White
 ✓ German-American
 ✓ College teacher
 ✓ Employee
 ✓ Son
 ✓ Brother
 ✓ Uncle
 ✓ Boyfriend
 ✓ Friend (in real life)
 ✓ “Friend” (on Facebook)
 ✓ Minnesotan
 ✓ Licensed driver
 ✓ 33-year-old
 ✓ Graduate of St. Agnes High School
 ✓ Member of the Dairy Queen Blizzard Fan 
Club
Each of these statuses comes with its own 
rights and responsibilities, and sometimes it’s 
hard to keep them all straight! In Chapter 6, I 
explain more about what happens when sta-
tuses come into conflict.

85
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
 
✓ The government: Democracies are organized a certain way; communist 
governments are organized another way; and military dictatorships 
are organized yet another way. A government’s organization affects the 
lives of all its citizens. The statuses available to people in the Soviet 
Union were very different than those available to people in Russia today. 
Compared to when they lived in a communist society, Russians today 
have more freedom to make significant amounts of money — but they 
also run a greater risk of being unemployed and impoverished.
 
✓ The military: Those who have access to weapons and command over 
armies can often force their will on others. A gun may be fired for rea-
sons having to do with culture, but whatever culture you belong to, a 
bullet is a bullet. A group or an individual with enough military power 
can overthrow a government and bring about a new way of life (for 
better or for worse) for millions of people.
 
In a society we agree on what our structural situation is, and it is not easy for 
us to change — sometimes it changes in ways we can control, and sometimes 
it changes in ways beyond our control. Technological revolutions, economic 
upheavals, and military coups can transform social organization in ways that 
may or may not be welcome, but are hard to control or predict.
Examining the culture-structure continuum
To say that structure is more stable than culture is not to say that structure 
never changes, or never varies. It’s helpful to make a distinction between cul-
ture and structure, but keep in mind that the word “culture” can be used to 
describe even the kind of basic understandings that change slowly and vary 
relatively little.
As an example, look at our economic system. The thousand-dollar bills in 
my wallet are real, but their value is a social construction — they have value 
only because the people in my society agree that they have value. If I visited 
England, I would need to trade my dollars for pounds before I could buy 
anything — and if I visited a completely different society, such as an isolated 
tribe in the South American rain forest, my dollars would be completely 
worthless. Our economic system is a basic component of our social struc-
ture, but still, in some ways it behaves like the things we call “culture.”
Because the line between “culture” and “structure” can be drawn in different 
places — and is, in fact, drawn in different places by different sociologists 
(confusing, I know!) — it’s helpful to think about the distinction between “cul-
ture” and “structure” as a continuum rather than a split between two fixed 
categories (see Figure 5-1). Some sociologists consider “culture” to be only 
relatively frivolous things like fashion and style; other sociologists consider 
“culture” to include everything that’s in your head. You can define “culture” as 
broadly as you want, but the more broadly you define it, the bigger the pic-
ture you have to look at if you want to see significant change and variation.

Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Sociologists who study changes in economic values or fundamental ways of 
life have to look at hundreds of years of history and compare entire nations 
to one another; sociologists who study changes in clothing styles or musical 
genres can see much more change over a shorter period of time. You’ve seen 
plenty of hairstyle trends come and go in your lifetime, and you may even 
have converted from one religion to another — but unless you’ve moved 
around the world, how many different economic systems or types of govern-
ment have you lived under? Here’s another example: over the past century, 
America has welcomed millions of immigrants who have brought diverse 
religious views and lifestyles to our country and significantly changed our 
culture — but our social structure has remained, fundamentally, that of a 
capitalist democracy. Structure is more resistant to change than is culture.
 
Are language and symbols (like red for “stop”) culture or structure? It’s confus-
ing because they’re widely shared and resistant to change like structure, but 
they’re also kind of arbitrary — what language you speak doesn’t matter, so 
long as you get your meaning across. Because they’re so fundamental to soci-
ety, and so universal within a society (everyone has to know what a stop sign 
means), from a sociological perspective they are closer to “structure” than to 
“culture.”

Studying Culture: Makin’ It and Takin’ It
It’s slippery enough to figure out what culture is, but that doesn’t stop 
sociologists — the whole point of defining culture is to figure out how it 
works and how (or even whether) it’s important.
Cultural sociologists argue that it’s crucial to separate the production of cul-
ture from the reception of culture. Knowing how or why a cultural product is 
produced doesn’t necessarily mean knowing what happens when someone 
sits down and looks at it, reads it, watches it, or plays it.
Culture and the end of slavery
Slavery in the United States officially ended 
with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 — 
a change in the law of the land. The end of 
slavery, though, was a sweeping social change 
associated with changes up and down the 
structure/culture continuum. All were important 
in bringing an end to slavery, but notice how 
change came most quickly (yet least decisively) 
at the culture end of the continuum.
 ✓ Art: Editorial cartoonists and writers like 
Harriet Beecher Stowe created works 
of art that criticized slavery and helped 
convince Americans that change was 
necessary.
 ✓ Religion: Many spiritual leaders took up 
emancipation as a religious issue, arguing 
that holding human beings as property was 
morally wrong and displeasing to God.
 ✓ Politics: Slavery was a central issue in 
American politics of the 19th century, hotly 
debated among candidates for political 
office. Abraham Lincoln was elected presi-
dent without the support of a single south-
ern state.
 ✓ Law: Even an executive order from 
President Lincoln couldn’t make slavery 
unconditionally illegal in the United States; 
that required the Thirteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1865.
 ✓ Economy: Slavery was fundamental to the 
economy of the southern states, and it 
took decades for those states to adjust to 
emancipation. Economic arrangements like 
sharecropping, which became widespread 
after the Civil War, in some ways were not 
very different than slavery.
 ✓ Language: One significant barrier to former 
slaves’ upward mobility was the fact that 
many slaves had not been taught to read 
or write, and had relatively little experience 
with the vocabulary and speech patterns 
of people of influence. Debates about race 
and education are with us to this day, and 
there is still a distinctive speaking style 
associated with African-Americans.
 ✓ Technology: By the 1860s, the ongoing 
development of agricultural technology 
making unskilled labor less valuable to 
farmers certainly didn’t hurt in convinc-
ing northerners and southerners alike to 
accept the idea of a world without slavery.

Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Both of these approaches have been used to study aspects of culture besides 
paintings, books, movies, and TV shows — but most studies have focused on 
cultural products such as those.
Other angles on culture
Sociologists don’t have a monopoly on the study of culture, but there are 
important differences between the sociological study of culture and the 
way other writers and thinkers approach the subject. It’s important to have 
some idea of these differences because as widely as the word “culture” is 
used in sociology, it’s used even more widely used in other disciplines. 
Understanding how other disciplines study culture will also help you under-
stand what’s distinctive about the sociological approach generally.
 
Sociologists can be wrong (and how!), but they aim to make their arguments 
about culture with solid data — the more data, the better — and reasonably 
precise analyses. Rather than becoming deeply familiar with any one culture 
to the exclusion of others, sociologists want to see what the commonalities 
and differences are across a range of cultures. This means that you’re much 
more likely to find numbers and statistics in a sociological study of culture 
than in an anthropological study, but what defines the sociological approach 
to culture is an interest in making scientific observations to find patterns that 
may be common across a wide range of different societies.
Looking at how other academic disciplines in the following list study culture 
helps in understanding how sociologists study culture:
Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline that is all about understanding culture. 
Anthropologists are deeply interested in culture — with an emphasis on 
deep. Anthropologists appreciate that social values and perspectives may 
vary widely from one society to another, and when they set out to study 
any society, from a rural Chinese village to a bustling neighborhood in cen-
tral Berlin, they are careful to question their preconceptions about what is 
“right” and “wrong.” 
Anthropologists document not only everyday practices (for example, meth-
ods of preparing food) but also the values that underlie those practices. The 
emphasis of most anthropologists is on precisely observing and really get-
ting to know the groups they are studying. They do compare culture across 
places and times, but intercultural comparison is less important for anthro-
pologists than it is for sociologists. Sociologists and anthropologists share a 
desire not to take anything for granted, but most sociologists would rather 

89
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
look for patterns across many cultures — or over a long period of time — 
rather than focusing so thoroughly on any one particular culture at any one 
particular time.
Cultural studies
In the field of “cultural studies,” scholars are similarly thorough and ana-
lytical in examining cultural practices and products. What does the movie 
Invasion of the Body Snatchers say about American society in the 1950s, when 
it was produced? What does the portrayal of women’s bodies in music videos 
from the 1980s have to do with the way women were viewed at that time? 
A scholar of cultural studies would likely be interested in those questions. 
They’re similar to the kind of questions that a sociologist might ask, but as 
with anthropology, the emphasis is more on achieving a deep understanding 
of a particular place and time than on making comparisons across places and 
times. Rather than writing an entire article or book about Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers, sociologists would be more likely to try to study a wide range of 
films produced in the 1950s and compare them with a similarly wide range of 
movies that came out in other decades.
Liberal arts
Of course, there may be no one more interested in culture than those people 
producing cultural products like books, movies, and music. Books like F. 
Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby and songs like Grandmaster Flash’s “The 
Message” have a great deal to say about culture and society — but writers of 
fictional stories and song lyrics are not scientists, and they don’t want to be! An 
artist’s goal is to say something with emotional impact and broad resonance, 
not to prove a point using systematic observations and analyses. It’s hard to 
prove a book or a song wrong, but sociologists support their arguments with 
hard data, systematically analyzed. As with any scientific study, a sociological 
study can be supported or challenged when new evidence comes to light.
The production of culture
Sociologists studying the production of culture concentrate on how and why 
cultural products are made. Sociologists working in this field have shown 
that structural changes behind the scenes can have a huge impact on the cul-
ture that we see. In the modern world, this means looking at the people, orga-
nizations, and technology important in the production of , for example:
 
✓ Movies
 
✓ Music
 
✓ Books
 
✓ Art

Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
One classic study of the production of culture was conducted by the husband-
and-wife team of Harrison and Cynthia White, who studied the rise of 
Impressionism in French painting. There’s no doubt that Claude Monet and 
Vincent van Gogh were artistic geniuses, but the Whites’ historical study 
showed that the sweeping transformation of art from precisely painted his-
torical scenes to beautifully fuzzy water lilies could only have happened after 
changes in organizations (the French art market spread beyond a single, cen-
tral market to a system of independent dealers), the economy (rising afflu-
ence meant that more people were able to buy art), and technology (paint 
became cheaper and easier to use). If Monet had come along 100 years ear-
lier, he would have been out of luck.
This study is an example of how culture (art and music) is affected by struc-
ture (organizations, the economy, technology). As communications technol-
ogy has developed, allowing culture created by a small group of people to 
quickly reach a very large group of people, understanding the production of 
culture has become increasingly important. Still, sociologists have shown 
that the same cultural product (say, a TV show) may have very different 
effects on different groups of people.
The reception of culture
Studying the reception of culture means looking at how people use and 
interpret culture — especially cultural products like books and TV shows. 
Sociologists working in this area have proven that people bring their own 
views and values to the culture they encounter; books, TV shows, movies, 
and music may affect everyone, but they affect different people in different 
ways. People seek them out for different reasons and make their own inter-
pretations of what they see, hear, and read. 
In a fascinating study, Neil Vidmar and Milton Rokeach showed episodes of the 
sitcom All in the Family to viewers with a range of different views on race. The 
show centers on a character named Archie Bunker, an intolerant bigot who 
often gets into fights with his more progressive family members. Vidmar and 
Rokeach found that viewers who didn’t share Archie Bunker’s views thought 
the show was very funny in the way it made fun of Archie’s absurd racism — 
in fact, this was the producers’ intention. On the other hand, though, viewers 
who were themselves bigots thought Archie Bunker was the hero of the show 
and that the producers meant to make fun of his foolish family!
This demonstrates why it’s a mistake to assume that a certain cultural prod-
uct will have the same effect on everyone. This doesn’t mean that cultural 
products have no effect — other studies have shown, for example, that TV 
shows depicting the dangers of drunk driving can actually make people less 
likely to drink and drive — but it does mean that the interaction between cul-
ture and people’s actions is a little more complicated than it might seem.

 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
Paddling the “Mainstream”
There are different ways of studying culture, different ways of producing cul-
ture, and different ways of interpreting culture — isn’t there anything we can 
all agree on?
In a word, no. But there are some things that come close! There are some 
very widely shared cultural norms and some very popular cultural products: 
things that just about everyone likes — or, at least, knows about. These 
things can be called mainstream culture. In this section, I explain how main-
stream culture can be a common point of reference, even for people who 
disagree with it and are trying to tear it apart. I’ll also bring up the argument 
that mainstream culture is disappearing, as everyone runs off to join tiny cul-
tural groups and ignoring other groups.
Even if people in a given society have different interpretations of, say, a popu-
lar book or television show, certain cultural products, ideas, and values are 
so widespread across society that they form mainstream culture: culture that 
has relatively wide agreement and awareness across a society. Parts of main-
stream culture include:
 
✓ Mainstream products:
 
• Blockbuster movies and popular songs
 
• Flags and other popular symbols
 
• Sacred texts
 
✓ Mainstream ideas and values:
 
• Widespread religious beliefs
 
• Ideas about what type of people are most important (men or 
women? white or black?)
 
• Ideas about what type of government is best (democracy? 
communism?)
 
✓ Mainstream practices:
 
• National holidays
 
• Rituals such as saying a prayer or a national pledge, watching a 
popular sport, or voting
 
• Dating and marriage practices
You’re not going to surprise or offend many people by setting off fireworks 
on the Fourth of July, or buying the latest box-office smash on DVD, or 
wearing jeans tailored to the latest trend. These things may, in fact, seem 
downright boring, but mainstream culture includes some of a society’s most 

92
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
cherished traditions and widely shared values. Even in societies that have 
many different cultural traditions, products, ideas, values, and practices in 
mainstream culture can provide common touchstones that help everyone get 
along — and have something to talk about around the water cooler or over 
the backyard fence!
 
What’s the difference between mainstream culture and structure? It’s a good 
question. After all, I said that structure is also something everyone in a society 
shares. The difference is that mainstream culture is still culture — it’s not nec-
essarily foundational to the way a society is organized, and like all culture (in 
the sociological sense), it sometimes changes quickly. Think about fashion: It 
sometimes seems like everyone is wearing one brand of shoes one year, and 
everyone is wearing another brand just the very next year. It would be a lot 
easier to get along having your own unique fashion (culture) than having your 
own unique currency (structure) — but still, most people tend to follow popu-
lar fashions. Even if they don’t, they usually know what the popular fashions 
are. That’s the power of mainstream culture.
Subculture
The word subculture refers to a culture that is strikingly, often deliberately, 
different from mainstream culture. Values and practices associated with a 
subculture will often seem odd to people who aren’t involved with that sub-
culture, and they may even cause outrage. Subcultures that are especially 
critical of mainstream culture are often referred to as countercultures.
A good example of a subculture that caused outrage can be found in the 
1970s punk subculture in England. As sociologist Dick Hebdige pointed out in 
a famous study of punks, members of that subculture adopted styles of dress 
that were designed to shock mainstream Brits. Punks pierced their lips with 
safety pins, spiked and dyed their hair, and — most offensively — used the 
British flag in subversive and disrespectful ways. By pinning Union Jacks to 
studded leather jackets and singing along to songs like the Sex Pistols’ snarl-
ing, sarcastic “God Save the Queen,” punks mocked the symbols of main-
stream British culture.
Not all subcultures are so forthrightly political, but all subcultures depart 
from mainstream culture in some combination of ways. Subcultures are also 
coherent: People in a subculture are being different from the mainstream, but 
they’re all being different in the same way, a way that they all share.
What makes a subculture a subculture (rather than just a different culture 
entirely) is that members of a subculture aren’t ignorant of mainstream 
culture — they know exactly what mainstream culture is, and they delib-
erately reject it. Sometimes, in fact, people in subcultures are even more 
acutely conscious of mainstream culture than are people in the mainstream. 
For example, some religious groups who disapprove of mainstream movies 

93
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
publish extremely comprehensive movie guides so that members of the sub-
culture can be aware of which mainstream movies are considered acceptable 
to that subculture and which are not. Someone who’s not in that subculture, 
on the other hand, could just walk into any cineplex and buy a ticket to any-
thing that looks good.
 
Subcultures can even have subcultures of their own — groups of people who 
abide by some norms and practices of the subculture, but deliberately reject 
others. An example of this is the “straight edge” movement in punk rock: a 
group of punks who dress like punks and act like punks but who share a com-
mitment not to use alcohol or drugs like punks do. This makes “straight edge” 
punks — are you ready for this? — a sub-subculture.
When subcultures reach a certain level of popularity, they may be absorbed 
into mainstream culture, thus ceasing to be different or shocking. Today you 
can walk into any London souvenir shop and buy a pair of thong underwear 
with the British flag printed on the crotch, and no one is likely to think you’re 
very much of a rebel for doing so.
Microcultures
Subcultures reject mainstream culture, but there can’t be such a thing as a 
subculture if there’s no mainstream culture to reject!
Developments in communications technology — the invention of the printing 
press and, later, radio and television — have been responsible for the spread 
of mainstream culture, and further technological developments may be help-
ing to bring it to an end. The Internet makes it easy for even relatively tiny 
groups to connect from anywhere around the world, thus making it easier 
to spend more and more time associating with people from your preferred 
subcultures. When there were only a few radio stations on the dial, almost 
everyone listened to the same music; now, Internet radio allows you to easily 
listen to any of thousands upon thousands of different radio stations. You 
can follow sports teams playing anywhere in the world, and you can order or 
download books published in any country.
Given these dramatic changes, sociologist Jason Kaufman has argued that it 
makes less and less sense to think of there even being anything like “main-
stream culture.” When you might have a completely different lifestyle than 
the woman living across the street or the guy sitting next to you at work, 
where is the mainstream? There may not necessarily be one. Kaufman says 
that we are increasingly living in a world of microcultures, where people can 
seek out small groups of like-minded people and spend nearly all their time 
interacting with them — rather than sharing the norms, values, and practices 
of people in their immediate surroundings. Birds of a feather have always 
flocked together, but now technology allows much smaller groups of birds to 
flock together from far-flung corners of the Earth.

94
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
If it’s true that we’re moving towards a world of microcultures, it will have 
important implications for everyone’s lives. Even though mainstream culture 
sometimes seems dull or bland, it does give everyone in a society a way to 
connect, something to share despite all their other differences.
Socialization: Where You 
Connect in Culture
Despite all the different perspectives on culture, there’s one thing everybody 
agrees on: Culture is not something you’re born with, it’s something you 
learn. Socialization refers to the process by which people learn the norms 
and values of their society as they grow up. Like all learning, socialization 
happens especially quickly when people are young, but it’s a process that 
continues throughout life. As long as you’re alive and interacting with other 
people, you’re being socialized (and helping to socialize others).
Some socialization is very deliberate; for example, when companies have 
diversity training sessions meant to teach employees to value the fact that 
their coworkers come from different social backgrounds. Most socialization, 
Off to see The Wizard
When the movie The Wizard of Oz was screened 
on commercial television once a year in the 
1960s, it used to be said that water pressure 
in big cities would suddenly drop during com-
mercials because the toilets were flushing in 
nearly every house in town. Whether or not that 
was actually true, it seemed plausible because 
almost everyone would be watching the same 
movie. What else would they watch? There 
were only a few channels they could possibly 
watch. Now that most households have cable 
TV with dozens of channels — not to mention 
access to millions of videos on the Internet — 
every single person in every single house on the 
block could be watching something different.
Was life better back in the day when every-
one watched the same shows and listened to 
the same music? Sociologist Robert Putnam 
believes that society used to have more 
“social capital” — more shared connections 
and understandings — whereas today people 
spend too much time in their own private worlds 
without caring what anyone else is doing. On 
the other hand, today’s technology allows 
people to make new kinds of social connec-
tions: If you’re not watching TV with your mom 
in the living room, you might be on the Internet 
connecting with friends across the country. 
Videos on the Internet can be seen by tens of 
millions of people around the world; that’s still 
shared culture, even if they’re not all coordinat-
ing their bathroom breaks.

95
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
however, happens by pure osmosis. Without even realizing it, you come to 
share the values and norms of the people around you. (See the beginning of 
this chapter for definitions of “values” and “norms.”) As you grow up, you 
learn an entire way of life — often without even realizing it — that may be 
very different from what other people in other situations are learning.
Nature vs. nurture: Social psychology
The way people learn culture is by interacting with those around them. 
Normally sociologists are interested in large groups of people (that is, how 
human society works) while psychologists are interested in people as indi-
viduals (that is, how the human mind works). But the two disciplines meet 
in a field called social psychology, which is studied by both psychologists 
and sociologists. Social psychology is the study of how people as individuals 
learn from and interact with the people around them.
A perennial question in social psychology is the question of nature vs. nur-
ture. Nature, in this formulation, stands for our genetic inheritance, the “pro-
gramming” we were born with. Nurture stands for everything that happens to 
us as we grow and learn through interactions with other people. Our genetic 
inheritance definitively influences many of our physical characteristics and 
may have a profound influence on traits like personality, disposition, and 
sexuality. But even identical twins, who have exactly the same DNA, develop 
different personalities and interests.
Breaking from the norm
When I was in kindergarten and first grade, I 
attended a school where as soon as any kid 
finished eating lunch, he or she was allowed 
to stand up and run straight out to the play-
ground for recess. Then I transferred to another 
school, and on the first day of second grade I 
finished my lunch and stood up, only to real-
ize that no one else was standing. One of the 
nuns who taught at the school came over and 
explained: “At this school, we all go out to 
recess together.” I blushed and sat back down.
Without even realizing what I was doing, I had 
breached a social norm: only when I did something 
differently than everyone else did I realize that I 
had been socialized into a different set of norms 
than the kids around me. A sociologist named 
Harold Garfinkel made a name for himself in 
the 1970s by instructing his students to go out 
and deliberately violate norms, just to see how 
people reacted. (For example, a student might 
board a city bus and try to negotiate with the 
driver about the fare.) Garfinkel’s deliberate 
“breaching experiments,” like my accidental 
one, demonstrated that we all live by rules that 
we’ve learned without even realizing that we’ve 
learned them.

There’s no one right answer to the question of nature vs. nurture: in reality, 
people develop through an interaction of their genetic programming with the 
environment around them. Although it’s not an inclusive list, Table 5-1 gives

the interaction of the two.

Skills and interests
You are who other people think you are
Through interpersonal socialization (see sidebar, “Not-so-secret agents”) 
people learn the values and norms of the group they’re born into, but they 
also learn who they are as individuals. This helps explain how even children 
born into the same family can develop very different personalities.
In An Inconvenient Squirrel, a children’s play by Joseph Scrimshaw, the 
squirrel of the title is “inconvenient” because he refuses to accept a name 
like “Really Important Squirrel” or “Master Thespian Squirrel,” a name that 
defines his identity. At one point, Evil Genius Squirrel explains to the inconve-
nient squirrel why having a public identity is so important: “You are,” he says 
slyly, “who other people think you are.”
Evil Genius Squirrel wasn’t the first one to figure this out. A sociologist 
named Charles Cooley (a member of the Chicago School, described in 
Chapter 3) coined the term “the looking-glass self” to describe the way that 
each person develops an idea of himself or herself by noticing how people 
act towards him or her.
Cooley emphasized the importance of each person’s “primary group” — the 
group of people with whom you interact most. Your family members, your 
very best friends, your closest coworkers: these are all members of your 
primary group. You implicitly learn norms and values from the members of 
your primary group, but you also notice how you’re different from them. 

97
 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
If you’re seen as “the quiet one” in your family, this becomes an important 
part of your identity, even if your family members generally are nonstop chat-
terboxes compared to the family next door.
Of course, some people break the looking glass, so to speak, and reject the 
way they are defined by their families. They may run away, rebel, or otherwise 
behave in a manner completely contrary to the way they were raised. It’s hard 
to understand why people change identities and personalities through life, 
and I’m relieved to say that we sociologists have the luxury of not even trying 
to understand any one individual’s behavior! It’s with good reason that people 
who need personal counseling go to a psychologist, not a sociologist. 
Not-so-secret agents
Sociologists use the term agents of socializa-
tion to refer to the various people and groups 
that socialize an individual into his or her 
culture(s). Here are a few different agents of 
socialization. Think about how they’ve affected 
the way you think about yourself and the world 
around you.
 ✓ Your family is a primary group that was 
responsible for your earliest and most 
important socialization. Your family has 
likely shaped everything from your habits to 
your moral values to your sense of humor 
and — most fundamentally — your sense 
of yourself. Who are you? What are the 
best and the worst things about you? Your 
parents and other close relatives have their 
own answers to those questions, and you 
can hardly have escaped being deeply 
affected by their views on the subject.
 ✓ A church (or sacred place generally) is a 
place where people go to connect with 
the spiritual world, but also — often very 
deliberately — to be socialized. Religious 
leaders and sacred texts often make strong 
prescriptions about everything ranging 
from when killing is acceptable to when 
wearing lipstick is acceptable. Religious 
services often include solemn rituals and 
have dress codes marking them as unusu-
ally important. People do sometimes switch 
religions, but they remain forever affected 
by the socialization they have received in 
communities of faith.
 ✓ School is another prime agent of social-
ization. Teachers and administrators typi-
cally make no bones about the fact that 
their socially-designated job is not just to 
transmit knowledge but to transmit culture. 
Government-run schools in many societies 
are limited to officially transmitting civic 
culture rather than religious or ethnic cul-
ture, but even then, schools drop a heap of 
socialization on every student every day — 
from a nation’s founding ideals to which 
side of the hallway you’re supposed to walk 
on. School is also a prime site of socializa-
tion by peers.
 ✓ The socializing power of the media is a 
matter of perennial debate. As I explained 
earlier in this chapter, people are active 
viewers, listeners, and readers who watch, 
listen to, and read media for many different 
reasons and learn different things from the 
same songs, shows, or books. That said, 
people certainly learn many important cul-
tural lessons from media, sometimes as 
profound as the value of diversity, some-
times as mundane as the latest dance 
craze.

98
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
What sociologists seek to understand is how human groups behave in gen-
eral, and what is true in general is that most people’s individual identities 
are very strongly shaped by their primary groups. There’s a real difference 
between the way most people relate to their families and closest friends (a 
personal, emotional connection) and the way they relate to their classmates 
and work colleagues (a friendly but more formal, less intimate connection).
Culture Paradox: Pulling Us Together 
and Pushing Us Apart
When people think about themselves in their social groups, they tend to 
notice cultural differences rather than cultural similarities. So one of the great 
contributions of sociology is calling attention to the many cultural values 
and norms that people share, that allow society to work as well as it does. 
When Garfinkel’s students tried to negotiate bus fare, they made clear that 
despite all the many cultural differences among people riding on a city bus, 
they share at least one powerful norm: the norm of equality, that each person 
should pay the same amount for the same bus ride.
 
Understanding culture is about more than just figuring out how today’s hot-
test recording artist sold all those millions of records. You have to understand 
culture if you want to understand society, and you have to understand culture 
if you want to understand yourself. You were born a unique individual 
because of your biological DNA, but also because of your social DNA. Think of 
all the social groups you’re a member of: your family, your neighborhood, 
your peer group, your sports teams, your clubs. You’re not the only member 
of any of them, but you are the only one who’s a member of all of them. So 
socially as well as biologically, you’re unique!
Uniting through culture
It’s because of our shared culture that people are able to get along as well as 
they do. In Chapter 3, I explain how Emile Durkheim saw society as being akin 
to an animal, with different social “organs” working together but doing differ-
ent jobs. In this view, culture is like the nervous system — it connects every-
thing and makes sure that every part of the organism is working together. 
Durkheim was fascinated by this coordination, by the way that people in big, 
diverse societies manage to go about their daily activities with relatively few 
arguments about anything of real consequence.

 Chapter 5: Socialization: What is “Culture,” and Where Can I Get Some? 
Yes, there is tension in society — from international wars to interpersonal 
tiffs — but most people, most of the time, actually get along pretty well. 
They don’t argue over bus fare, fight over whether they have to stop at red 
lights, or debate whether people should be allowed to have private property. 
People in democratic societies may argue over which candidate should be an 
elected leader, but except for societies in great turmoil, they don’t argue over 
whether there should be an election or whether some people’s votes ought 
to be counted more than others’.
It’s thanks to all these shared values that people are able to build and main-
tain great cities, to work together to find cures for diseases, and to make and 
distribute movies and songs that are loved by millions. Think about how 
much harder it would be to accomplish these things if people didn’t share 
cultural values and rituals.
Imagine having a business meeting where there was absolutely no small talk, 
where you felt absolutely no identification with the people you were meet-
ing with. It would be excruciatingly awkward, perhaps to the point that it 
would be hard to accomplish anything—and what, exactly, would you be 
trying to accomplish anyway? Widely shared culture greases the wheels, sets 
the agenda, and sets helpful limits on what is and isn’t acceptable. It’s just 
about the most important thing we humans do with our relatively supersized 
brains, and it may be our crowning achievement as a species.
Dividing because of culture
Still, there are plenty of conflicts in society, and cultural differences are at 
the heart of many of them. Wars have erupted over differences of religion 
and tradition; in some neighborhoods, you might be shot for dressing a cer-
tain way or speaking a certain language.
Emile Durkheim likened society to an organism, but Karl Marx — who I 
introduce in Chapter 3 — would have thought that was far too optimistic. He 
would say that it’s nice to think that people are all working together for the 
collective good, but in fact most people are working for the benefit of the few 
lucky ones who control what gets done and what doesn’t. He called religion 
(an important part of culture) “the opiate of the people” because he believed 
that it just helped to lull people into a kind of snooze, making them feel warm 
and fuzzy while discouraging them from questioning the status quo. By this 
logic, all of mainstream culture might be considered an “opiate.”

100
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Other sociologists have pointed out that cultural differences can reinforce 
and even strengthen structural differences. Pierre Bourdieu pointed out that 
people with structural privileges — more wealth, better jobs — may use cul-
ture as a way to keep less fortunate people from claiming any of those privi-
leges. No matter how qualified you are, you’ll be at a disadvantage applying 
for many high-paying jobs if you show up speaking with a certain accent, or 
wearing the wrong brand of suit, or admitting that you know nothing about 
fine art. (See Chapter 8 for more on how cultural capital can contribute to 
social stratification.)
But cultural divisions aren’t always class divisions. Sometimes cultural dif-
ferences divide people despite the fact that they’re in very similar structural 
situations. In some neighborhoods, different ethnic groups don’t mix: they 
keep separate social groups and are suspicious of one another even though 
they live amongst each other, have very similar jobs, and face similar chal-
lenges that they could work together to solve if they weren’t divided by cul-
tural differences.
So culture in some ways unites us and in other ways divides us — the bottom 
line is that culture matters.

▶ Making rational — and irrational — choices
▶ Taking the stage of life: symbolic interactionism
S
ociologists study huge historical trends and conflicts among large 
groups, but many sociologists are also fascinated with the way individu-
als interact in society. This is called microsociology because it’s the study of 
society at its “smallest” — as small as two people interacting.
The society you live in gives shape and purpose to your life, but it also 
imposes limits. How do you deal with the social rules that guide you, and 
how do you use them to your advantage? What do you do when you encoun-
ter someone who plays by different rules than you do?
Just as understanding society helps to understand the choices individuals 
face, so do sociologists need to have some idea of individual psychology to 
understand how society works. If people’s actions and choices aren’t to some 
extent predictable, then nothing in society is predictable. In general, sociolo-
gists find that people are fairly predictable on average — but that doesn’t 
mean that their choices always “make sense.” As you may have noticed in 
your own life, sometimes people are predictably confusing.
In this chapter, I explain how sociologists think about the individual person 
in society — how and why a person makes the choices he does, and what 
effect this has on his society. I start by laying out the fundamental problem: 
How can society be both outside you and inside you? I continue on to discuss 
the problem of people’s unpredictability, and conclude with an explanation 
of how people “perform” in society like actors on a stage.

102
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Within You and Without You: 
The Paradox of Society
Thinking about the individual in society forces sociologists to think about a 
very basic question: What is society? Are you “society”? Am I “society”? If we 
both live in the same society, we live by many of the same rules and under-
standings — but who made those up, and who’s in charge of changing them? 
If it’s not us, then who? From the perspective of any individual person, soci-
ety is in many ways a paradox: Society is both within you (the norms, rules, 
and assumptions you take for granted; see Chapter 5 for more on norms and 
values) and without you (they’ve been taught by others, who continue to 
impose them on you whether you like it or not). In this section, I first explain 
how “social facts” are the sum of individual actions, and then discuss how 
your social knowledge can serve as a toolbox to help you do well in different 
contexts.
Social facts: The sum of our parts
In Chapter 3, I explain that Emile Durkheim urged sociologists to focus on 
social facts: facts about a society in general, not about any individual person 
within that society. By definition, a social fact is true of your society, but 
it doesn’t say anything about you . . . or does it? You are part of your soci-
ety, and your actions and beliefs are part of what defines that society. Your 
actions help make up the aggregate facts about your society, and your beliefs 
both influence and are influenced by your society’s norms and values.
Aggregate facts: You don’t have to be like everyone 
else . . . but it’s a lot easier that way
An aggregate fact is a summary fact about a number of smaller things. When 
used in the context of sociology, the term “aggregate fact” usually refers to 
an overall description of what a large number of people are doing. An aggre-
gate trend describes how an aggregate fact is changing over time.
The following aggregate facts are true of many societies in the world today, 
and they may be true of yours:
 
✓ Marriages: About half of all marriages end in divorce.
 
✓ Jobs: People typically hold several different jobs over the course of 
their working lives.
 
✓ Musical Tastes: Most people don’t listen to classical music.

103
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
Knowing these facts about your society, however, tells me nothing about you 
as an individual. It doesn’t tell me about your personal history or the choices 
you personally will make in life. Those social facts don’t describe your life — 
but they do affect it! For better and for worse, those aggregate facts about your 
society heavily influence your own life, and make it different than it would be if 
you lived in a different society.
To understand how facts about society in general can affect your own per-
sonal life, think about these points:
 
✓ Marriage: When deciding whether to marry someone, you do so with the 
understanding that, however you may personally feel about marriage, in 
your society generally marriage is very often impermanent. That doesn’t 
mean marriage is taken lightly, but it does mean that if the going gets 
rough and you or your partner decide to bail, you will be in the company 
of a large number of your friends and colleagues who have also expe-
rienced divorce. Consciously or unconsciously, the fact that divorce 
is socially acceptable may influence you to make a riskier marriage 
decision than you would in a society where divorce is not considered 
acceptable.
 
✓ Job: Similarly, when you take a job, you can’t — and shouldn’t — expect 
that it will be permanent. It may just be, but that would not be the norm. 
You can expect to have other job opportunities in the future, which 
would be very unusual for you to never take. This means that you prob-
ably won’t look for a job that will last a lifetime — you’ll look for a job 
that will serve you well over the next few years.
 
✓ Music: You can listen to whatever music you want, but if you choose to 
listen to Beethoven or Mozart, you won’t be able to chat about it with 
most of the people around you — unless you happen to be a member of 
an orchestra. Everywhere from TV programs to dentists’ offices to night-
clubs, you’re much more likely to hear pop, rock, or R&B than classical 
music. If you listen to mostly classical music, you are unusual, and it 
may cause people to make certain assumptions about your background 
and personality. For this reason, you may choose not to listen to classi-
cal music, or to listen to it only in private. On the other hand, you may 
very deliberately and openly choose to listen to classical music if you 
want to convey a certain impression.
Norms, values, and laws
In Chapter 5, I describe the continuum of social understandings and agree-
ments, running from “structure” to “culture.” All along that continuum there 
are norms and values that shape your life — the rules and repertoires of your 
society.

104
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
At the “structure” end of the continuum are rules that are hard and fast, relat-
ing to your economic system and the laws of the land. Laws are social norms 
that are seen as being so important that they’re written down and made 
formal, so that if you break them you can be punished — with punishments 
ranging from a small fine to a death sentence. (For more on crime and devi-
ance, see Chapter 11.) For example, you can’t just
 
✓ Make up your own currency and expect it to buy you anything at the 
store.
 
✓ Give yourself a job or expect anyone else to give you one if they don’t 
have one to give.
 
✓ Break the law and expect to not be punished.
At the “culture” end of the continuum are norms and values that are prob-
ably not written into law, but that are nonetheless real. For example:
 
✓ Current fashions and styles, such as whether or not it’s acceptable to 
wear socks with sandals
 
✓ Religious principles and rituals, such as Bar Mitzvahs or the baptism of 
children
 
✓ Social traditions, such as shooting off fireworks on certain national 
holidays
You don’t have to follow any of these social norms, but if you don’t, people 
around you may find your behavior confusing or even rude.
It may seem unfair — you didn’t make any of these rules. In fact, no single 
person did. Economic realities are beyond the control of even the largest 
companies; laws may be proposed by specific legislators but normally must 
meet with broad approval to be passed; and fashion trends may be started by 
popular people, but no one can single-handedly make something trendy.
No individual person makes social norms, but every single person helps per-
petuate and enforce them. How? Simply by following them and by noticing 
when other people don’t. You can try to buck the trend, but you’ll almost cer-
tainly face resistance. (For more on movements directed at changing society, 
see Chapter 13.)
Use a tool (from your social 
repertoire) — don’t be one
Your life as an individual in society is shaped by trends, norms, values, and 
laws, but what are you supposed to do when you don’t know what to do? 
Societies today are diverse, and in the course of your daily life you may move 

105
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
through several different social circles, each with its own norms. For this 
reason, life in society can be very confusing, not to mention frustrating — 
even dangerous.
Sociologist Ann Swidler coined the term cultural toolkit to refer to all the 
cultural knowledge that you keep in your head. Your cultural knowledge is 
like a toolkit because you don’t always use all of it — but it’s ready for you 
when you want or need to use it. Whereas some social norms are so taken for 
granted that it might never even occur to you to do otherwise, some social 
norms vary dramatically from one place to the next; if you know the norms 
and values associated with different social contexts, you can act appropri-
ately in a range of situations. For example:
 
✓ You might dress in a suit and watch your language at work — but then 
slip into jeans and a t-shirt for your after-work softball game, where you 
can freely drink beer and swear.
 
✓ You might know to accept a business card with one hand in the United 
States — but with two hands in China.
 
✓ You might know to clap and cheer after an impressive solo at a jazz 
show — but not at an orchestral performance.
The term code switching is often used to refer to this process of adapting to 
different social contexts. Prudence Carter, a sociologist of education, talked 
to inner-city teens and found that they were able to succeed at school and at 
home by knowing how to talk and dress in one way to impress their teachers 
in school, and in another way to impress their peers at home on the block.
Everyone does this kind of code-switching to some extent, but knowing how 
to do it well, and in many different situations, is a tremendous advantage. 
The trick is managing all those different roles.
This is part of the paradox of society: You have the freedom to choose how 
you will behave, but your own social background both determines what behav-
iors you are familiar with and influences which ones you’ll choose. You’ve 
probably been advised to “just be yourself” — but who you are comes, in large 
part, from your society. Futhermore, “being yourself” varies from one social 
context to the next. If you wear a suit to work and do a job you’re proud of, and 
then go home and sit on the couch watching TV in your sweats, in which con-
text are you being most “yourself”? Some sociologists have gone so far as to 
say that the idea of “being yourself” only makes sense in a social context. When 
you think about “who you are,” what you’re really thinking about is how you’re 
similar to, and different from, the people around you.
A friend of mine has a son who recently started playing with a team in the 
National Football League. The man is, of course, very proud of his son. The 
day his son was scheduled to play in the team’s starting lineup for the first 

106
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
time, it happened to be an away game at the stadium of an opposing team. 
My friend and his brother-in-law flew out to the city where the game was 
being played and headed for the stadium wearing jerseys with his son’s name 
and team on them.
As they approached the stadium, though, they began to be confronted by 
fans of the opposing team. Seeing the visitors’ jerseys, the fans jeered and 
shouted threats at my friend — some even threw themselves in my friend’s 
path and asked him what he thought he was doing. My friend’s brother-in-
law tried to make peace, yelling things like: “This man’s son is starting in 
his first NFL game! You should buy him a drink!” The opposing team’s fans 
didn’t seem to care, and my friend came close to turning back and watching 
the game from the safety of his hotel room. The two pressed on, though, and 
finally made it safely to their seats.
 
This story shows how risky — even dangerous — it can be to violate certain 
social norms. It’s not against the law to cheer for a visiting team; in fact, it 
would be illegal to try to stop someone from doing so. Still, my friend found 
himself walking into a situation where cheering for the visitors was such a vio-
lation of social norms that he could have been seriously hurt. He was free to 
ignore that norm — and he did — but it was at his own peril.
Rational — and Irrational — Choices
So at any given moment, you have choices — choices within, among, and 
outside of social norms. Understanding social norms is one of the things that 
sociologists do best. Collecting data about large groups and understanding 
aggregate decisions by hundreds or thousands of people . . . that’s the meat 
and potatoes of sociology.
For Durkheim, that was all sociology needed to do. Other sociologists, 
though, have argued that a sociological theory is incomplete if it doesn’t 
explain how social facts play out at the individual level. It may be convenient 
to imagine that one social fact (for example, a country’s religious makeup) 
directly affects another (for example, that country’s suicide rate) — but the 
actual fact of the matter is that social facts affect one another by affecting 
individual people. Spain doesn’t “decide” to have a certain suicide rate; indi-
vidual Spaniards decide for themselves whether or not to take their lives. 
Even Durkheim, for all his focus on social facts, offered theories about why 
a certain social fact (religion, the economy, war) might make an individual 
person more or less likely to commit suicide — thus affecting the country’s 
suicide rate. Sociologists don’t need to become psychologists, but they do 
need to have some idea of why people make the choices they do.

107
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
Making rational choices — 
or, at least, trying to
To understand how or why a person makes choices in society, it makes sense 
to begin with the assumption that everyone at least tries to be rational in his 
or her decision-making. After that, you can consider how and why people 
often seem to be irrational in the choices they make. In the following sections, 
I explain how what sociologists and economists refer to as rational choice 
theory (or, sometimes, rational action theory) works in situations from car 
shopping to date shopping.
Understanding rational choice theory
Besides sociology and psychology, another social science that seeks to scien-
tifically understand human behavior is economics. For centuries, economists 
have operated under the basic assumption that people are rational creatures 
who will, in general, make the choices they feel are best for themselves. This 
is the principle of rational choice, which most economists and many sociolo-
gists believe is the best way to understand individual human behavior. They 
believe that even in cases where someone’s actions seem inexplicable, there 
is probably a self-serving motive behind those actions. Understanding human 
behavior, in this view, means figuring out exactly how people believe they 
will benefit from the choices they make.
It’s obvious what this means in economic terms: People will — or at least, 
they’re supposed to — choose the savings account with the highest interest 
rate, or buy a product from the retailer who offers the lowest price. But real-
life decisions, even decisions about relatively simple economic matters, are 
rarely that clear cut.
Say you’re shopping for a car. You’d like to get a bargain, but of course 
you’re not going to just buy the cheapest car you can possibly buy! There are 
some amenities you need and value in a car, and you understand that in gen-
eral, more expensive cars are going to have more of these features.
Even then, a certain amount of money — say, $25,000 — might buy any of 
dozens or hundreds of different cars. There are several choices you need to 
make about what aspects of a car you value. For example, you might consider:
 
✓ How much is it worth to you to have a new car versus a used one?
 
✓ Would you rather have a very reliable car, or a very high-performing one?
 
✓ How much does it matter whether your car is fuel-efficient and environ-
mentally friendly?

108
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
 
✓ Does it matter whether or not the car is made in your country? Would 
you pay more for a domestic car versus an imported car?
 
✓ Does it matter how the car looks? If so, what color or model do you 
want, and how much extra would you pay to get it?
It’s a complicated decision — and you’ll never find a car in any price range 
that has all the features you want — but social scientists who believe in the 
principle of rational choice argue that you do know the answers to all of the 
above questions, and when you go car shopping, you will buy the car that 
comes closest to meeting all your different needs.
Applying rational choice to non-financial decisions
What about decisions that fall outside the strictly economic realm, though? 
What about the decisions you make that have nothing to do with money as 
such? Are those decisions “rational,” too? Indeed they are, many economists 
and sociologists believe.
Consider romantic relationships. In many ways it seems like you don’t 
“choose” your partner; rather, a relationship just happens. People say things 
like, “when I met Darlene, I just knew it was right,” or “all of a sudden it had 
been two years and bang! I found myself engaged.”
The fact of the matter is, though, that unless you live in a society where mar-
riages are 100 percent arranged by parents and family, you do have a choice 
in whom you marry. People even talk about it this way. “I’ve been looking for 
someone like you,” someone will say, and the response may be, “I was hoping 
you would offer to take me out on a date, and I knew I would accept your offer.”
Just as with cars, people may make a range of choices about what character-
istics they’re looking for in a romantic partner.
 
✓ Do you want someone who has a similar job to yours, or a different one?
 
✓ Does it matter to you how much money the person makes? (Be honest!)
 
✓ Does it matter to you how much education the person has, or what they 
studied?
 
✓ How much does physical attractiveness matter to you? (Again, be 
honest!) Are there certain characteristics, like hair color or height, that 
especially matter to you?
 
✓ Does it matter whether your partner shares your religious background, 
or comes from the same area you do?
 
✓ Does it matter whether your partner shares your race or ethnic background?
 
✓ Does it matter who your partner’s friends and family are?
 
✓ Does it matter what your partner’s leisure interests are? Is it important 
that they be similar to yours?

109
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
Of course these things do matter, and online matchmaking sites take 
advantage of that fact to pair their members with one another. Some such 
sites boast surprisingly high success rates, suggesting that an algorithmic 
approach to romance might not be fundamentally incompatible with human 
happiness.
The rational choice theorists might seem to have it all sealed up: Even when 
it comes to something as intimate and personal as love and marriage, people 
are rational decision-makers who make choices that will give them maximum 
value.
Or are they? Sometimes people make choices that don’t seem very rational. 
Can rational choice theory explain bad decisions?
D’oh! Making poor choices
Rational choice theory makes a world of sense when people are making 
choices that actually make sense — but what about when they aren’t? 
Art cars
If one challenge for rational choice theorists 
is understanding how people’s personal deci-
sions about things like love and relationships 
are “rational,” another big challenge is under-
standing how and why people buy art. How do 
people even begin to place a value on a painted 
canvas that serves little purpose beyond hang-
ing on the wall?
It turns out that they place a high degree of 
importance on knowing who the artist is. If the 
artist is someone well known, perhaps someone 
with an interesting personal story like Vincent 
van Gogh (who cut off his own ear) or Jackson 
Pollock (who tore his way through the New 
York art world, shocking and delighting people 
with his paint-splattered canvases), buyers will 
place a high value on almost any work bearing 
that artist’s name.
Sociologists Joel Podolny and Marya Hill-
Popper studied the market for cars, and they 
discovered that at the high end of the car 
market, buyers and sellers talk about cars less 
as though they were cars and more as though 
they were works of art. Much attention is given 
to the person who designed the car, the com-
pany that built it, and the context in which it was 
built and sold — just as would be the case for 
a work of art.
By contrast, if you’re buying a relatively cheap 
car that will just get you from place to place, 
you probably won’t be sitting around with the 
seller talking about the model’s history and ped-
igree. My friend Paul was selling an old beat-up 
car for the appropriately low price of $500, and 
he received an e-mail from a prospective buyer 
asking him a number of complicated questions 
about the car. Paul’s thought was to respond, 
“The answer to your first question is: five hun-
dred dollars. The answer to every one of your 
other questions is: five hundred dollars.”

110

Often people make choices that just don’t seem to be in their own self-
interest. Isn’t this a problem for economists and sociologists who believe 
people are rational choice makers?
When I was a teenager my parents often found themselves questioning my 
rationality — for example, when a friend and I tried to bicycle halfway across 
Minnesota on the shoulder of an interstate freeway — but they weren’t the 
first ones to notice that people sometimes make inexplicable decisions. In 
this section, I go through four of the biggest challenges to rational choice 
theory. Do people’s decisions make any sense at all?
Challenge #1: Sometimes people make sub-optimal choices
What does “sub-optimal” mean? It means that sometimes people make choices 
that aren’t their best (that is, most optimal) choices. You might buy a car from 
one dealer when the dealer right next door has a much better car selling for 
the same amount of money. That’s not very rational . . . is it? Well, maybe it is. 
This view of rationality is called bounded rationality: You make the best deci-
sions you can, based on the information you have time to collect.
No one has all the time in the world, and it takes time to gather the informa-
tion you need to make a good choice. One of the decisions you have to make 
when you’re making a purchase, or a career choice, or a choice of spouse, is 
how much time you can afford to spend learning about all your options. Maybe 
you’ve just spent all weekend visiting several dealerships, and the car you 
chose to buy is the best bargain available at any of those dealerships. Sure, 
you may have found a better bargain if you visited the next dealer down . . . 
but then why not visit the next one as well, and the next and the next and 
the next? At some point you have to decide that you’ve spent enough time 
searching to make a reasonably well-informed choice. There is, after all, 
somewhere you want to actually go in your car!
Challenge #2: Sometimes people deliberately make irrational choices
What if you know you’re being irrational?
Millions of people around the world gamble, putting billions of dollars at risk 
at casinos, in lotteries, and with bookies. They do this despite the fact that, 
on average, gambling is a losing proposition — governments run lotteries to 
make up budget shortfalls, and casino proprietors can reap fabulous profits. 
Sure, you might hit it big at the slots or in the lottery, but probably you’ll 
lose. The house always makes sure that the odds are in its favor.
You know that, and you still choose to gamble. Why? You might choose to do 
so for entertainment value, knowing that your losses are essentially what you 
pay for an exciting night at the casino. Many people, though, don’t see it that 
way — they play to win, even if they know that on average they won’t. Why 
would they do this?

111
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
People are sometimes irrational in ways like this — but they’re also predict-
ably irrational. Social scientists have demonstrated a range of ways that 
people can predictably be tricked into making irrational decisions:
 
✓ Psychologists have discovered that people predictably respond to 
irregular reward patterns, so a slot machine is consistently much more 
addictive than, say, a change machine. You know that every time you 
put a dollar into a change machine you’ll be rewarded with exactly four 
quarters. What fun is that?
 
✓ Economists have discovered that people consistently value near-term 
rewards over long-term rewards — so $20 now may be worth more to 
you than $25 next month. Credit card companies understand this prin-
ciple, and they have great success offering huge amounts of immediate 
cash in exchange for long-term payments that may end up being over 
double the amount of the original loan.
 
✓ By creating associations, marketers know that they can influence peo-
ple’s purchasing decisions. If you see a celebrity you admire drinking a 
particular brand of soda, you place a greater value on that soda even if 
you wouldn’t choose it over a competitor in a taste test.
These are irrationalities in human behavior — but at least they’re known irra-
tionalities. They can be incorporated into theories about human behavior; 
even when people are irrational, they’re often still very predictable.
Head in the stars, feet on the ground
The writer Isaac Asimov was, by any account, 
a brilliant man: Besides penning some of the 
greatest science fiction stories of all time, he 
wrote hundreds of nonfiction books on every-
thing from Shakespeare to biochemistry to the 
Bible. You would certainly think you could count 
on him to be rational.
And yet Asimov had an irrational fear of flying. 
He rode in airplanes twice when he was in the 
military during World War II, but after his dis-
charge he never again flew anywhere. As his 
fame grew and he was in demand for speak-
ing engagements in far-flung places, he and 
his wife would drive long distances — even 
though Asimov surely knew that on average, 
your chances of being killed in an accident 
are significantly greater if you drive across the 
country than if you fly the same distance.
Do people such as Isaac Asimov present a prob-
lem for social scientists? On the one hand, a 
story like this makes it seem like people are com-
pletely unfathomable — you can never predict 
human behavior. On the other hand, Asimov is 
an exception. Most people don’t have a fear like 
Asimov’s, and if they can afford to will choose to 
fly rather than drive long distances. Whether or 
not sociologists think of themselves as believers 
in “rational choice,” all of sociology rests on the 
assumption that on average, people’s behavior is 
at least somewhat predictable.

Challenge #3: Emotion
All this talk of “predictability” and “rational choice” makes people seem like 
computers — maybe computers with some programming quirks, but comput-
ers nonetheless. What about emotion? Don’t people do things such as:
 
✓ Marry for love, even when it doesn’t make “sense”?
 
✓ Strike out in anger without stopping to think about the consequences?
 
✓ Overeat to fill emotional needs?
 
✓ Respond to emotional appeals for money and other support?
 
✓ Have a hard time working because they’re very sad about something 
that’s happened to them?
How can anyone claim to understand human behavior without taking account 
of emotion?
An economist or a sociologist who believes in rational choice models of 
human behavior might respond to that challenge by pointing out that emo-
tion actually plays less of a role in our decision-making than it might seem. 
For example, even if it seems to people like they’re marrying for love, on aver-
age people are actually quite precise about marrying people who are similar 
to them. Stories about star-crossed lovers who pursue their romance against 
all odds make for great plays and movies, but most people, most of the time, 
don’t fall helplessly into doomed love affairs — they conveniently fall in love 
with coworkers or classmates with whom they have a lot in common.
Emotion often follows rationality, rather than the other way around. (Oddly, 
this also works with beliefs and actions — people’s beliefs often follow their 
actions rather than vice-versa. See Chapter 13 for more on this.) So although 
it certainly sometimes happens that people get carried away with emotion 
and commit self-destructive acts or do things that seem to make no sense, 
social scientists have observed that on average, people do in fact act ratio-
nally — or at least, predictably.
On a psychological level, extreme cases of irrationality caused by strong 
emotion may be associated with depression or schizophrenia: psychological 
disorders that occur for known reasons and are often treatable with medica-
tion and therapy. When people find that their emotions are tending to get 
the better of them, causing them to make choices that harm themselves or 
others, they often try to manage that irrationality and put themselves back 
on track.
Challenge #4: Altruism
Altruism refers, in a word, to generosity. When you offer a service or a gift 
with no thought of reward, that is pure altruism. When you offer something 
for a small reward (like a t-shirt or a hug), that’s still generosity — even if it’s 

113
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
not pure altruism. The existence of this kind of prosocial behavior may be 
the Achilles’ heel of rational choice theory.
Of course, most people are not Mother Teresa. In many cases, when we give 
things away, we get other things in return. For example:
 
✓ A major donor to a museum or a college may be rewarded by having a 
building named after them, and may be given a seat on a board of direc-
tors, yielding valuable social and professional connections.
 
✓ When you give your boyfriend or girlfriend a birthday gift, you cause 
them to feel more attached to you and thus gain security in your rela-
tionship — plus, when it’s your birthday they will probably turn right 
around and give you a gift of comparable value.
 
✓ When you volunteer your time to an organization, you are gaining 
potentially valuable experience and the social prestige of being seen to 
give your time away. Plus, you may be having fun and/or being directly 
rewarded with free services or products from that organization.
All this being true, it’s still the case that often people do act altruistically in 
ways that are hard to understand from a rational-choice perspective. People 
make anonymous donations, stand by loved ones for years while they fight 
fatal diseases, and toil at services that few see or appreciate.
In fact, some sociologists argue that living peacefully and constructively in 
society requires constant acts of generosity on everyone’s part. If everyone 
actually tried to get away with whatever they could, doing exactly what they 
pleased just so long as the reward eclipsed whatever punishment they might 
face, society would fall apart. Think about what it would be like if every store-
keeper had to assume that every single customer would steal if given any 
opportunity, or if no one ever let anyone else merge into a crowded lane on 
the freeway. No police force could hold a society together if all its members 
were determined to act for their personal gain.
So why don’t they? According to Durkheim, it’s norms and shared values 
that hold society together. Society is not just about jumping on the back of 
the next guy so you can get higher; it’s about cooperating to achieve goals 
together — and joining together to celebrate those achievements. People 
internalize the norms of society so deeply that they regularly act in ways that 
would seem to be contrary to any selfish motives . . . and fortunately, this 
leads to a working society that benefits everyone. To understand the deci-
sions a person makes, you have to understand the society they come from.
 
This question is specifically relevant to people who want to design an effective 
government: What can you count on people to do for the good of society, and 
what do you need to force people to do? I cover that topic in more detail in 
Chapter 13.

Symbolic Interactionism: Life is a Stage
Symbolic interactionism is the term used to describe the study of individual 
human interaction in its social context. The word “symbolic” refers to the fact 
that as people interact with one another in society, they use a range of signs 
and symbols that have particular meanings in that society — everything from 
words to gestures to styles of dress. The fact that people don’t always agree 
on the meanings of particular symbols makes life interesting, as each person 
tries to achieve their social goals by using the symbols to their advantage. Life 
is a stage, and each person may play a number of different characters.
That sounds complicated . . . and it is! The basic ideas behind the sociologi-
cal study of individual interaction are not complicated, though. In the remain-
der of this chapter I explain how microsociologists understand individual 
interaction, what they pay attention to when they observe humans interact-
ing face to face.
Brother, can you spare a yam?
The yam exchanges of the Trobriand Islanders 
of the South Pacific, famously studied by 
anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, have 
become a classic example of how gift giving 
can knit a society together. At certain times, 
with great ceremony, men present their sisters 
and daughters with gifts of yams. The yams are 
stored in ceremonial yam houses, where they 
are preserved as symbols of social connec-
tion — in fact, the yams generally sit there until 
they rot because families will grow their own 
yams rather than eat the yams so generously 
presented to them by their relatives.
In other words, among the Trobrianders, a cere- 
monial gift of yams is purely a gift given for the 
sake of giving, in a ceremonial exchange that is 
virtually mandatory. It’s a gift in the sense that 
it’s not a payment for service, and it’s altruis-
tic in the sense that you’re giving away actual 
yams that you could otherwise have eaten — 
but though you know that the yams probably 
aren’t actually going to be eaten, you’d better 
not keep them for yourself or you’ll face serious 
social disapproval and life will become quite 
unpleasant.
So why, then, the yam exchange? Isn’t it just a 
big waste of food? Regardless of how it came 
about, the yam exchange serves to make social 
ties visible and to remind everyone of their obli-
gations to one another. Sometimes a gift is a gift 
of genuine value outside the exchange (like that 
$50 check you got for graduation), and other 
times a gift is just a gift (like that weird little 
ceramic figurine you also got). They both have a 
lot of importance in our society, and that’s why 
your mother told you to say “thank you” for all 
your gifts. (Though unless you’re a Trobriander 
exchanging yams, it’s probably most appropri-
ate to say “thank you” and “you’re welcome” 
with words rather than ceremonial hip thrusts.) 

115
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
 
When you, or anyone else, use words, clothes, or other symbols to communi-
cate, you know (or you should know) to take into consideration that different 
people will interpret them in different ways. A musician whose lyrics include a 
lot of profanity knows full well that the songs will offend some listeners and 
excite others.
Play ball! The rules of the game
As I explain in Chapter 3, microsociology was largely developed by early 
American sociologists, especially those in the Chicago School. They looked 
at people interacting in the busy, diverse metropolis and came up with some 
important ideas about how people negotiate complex social situations.
One of the most important thinkers in this tradition was George Herbert 
Mead, a Chicago philosopher who influenced many sociologists. Mead 
pointed out that social life is like a game, and argued that organized game 
playing among children was a crucial part of their socialization. (For more on 
socialization, see Chapter 5.)
In a baseball game, for example, there are several different positions — each 
with its own responsibilities and limits. Each position has a defined goal, 
which can be accomplished only through certain means. The batter’s goal is 
to get the ball way into the outfield, ideally over the outfield wall; but they 
can’t just grab the ball out of the catcher’s mitt and run it out there, they 
have to hit it with the bat. Similarly, the pitcher’s job is to keep the batter 
from hitting the ball, but the pitcher isn’t allowed to hang onto the ball and 
make the batter try to steal it — it needs to be thrown over the plate so the 
batter has a fair chance.
 
Sociologists today talk about statuses and roles. Your status in society is simi-
lar to your position in a baseball game: It defines your relationship to other 
people and comes with certain freedoms and responsibilities. A role is the set 
of recommended and required behaviors that go with a status.
Why bother distinguishing between statuses and roles? Because they can both 
change from one situation to another. There are a different set of statuses in a 
company (president, vice president, manager, clerk) than there are in a family 
(mother, father, child, grandparent); and between social groups with similar 
statuses, those statuses may be associated with different roles. In one family, 
the father may have the role of disciplinarian, whereas in another he may have 
the role of nurturer. Your role in a social group gives you a certain set of goals 
and defines what you can, should, shouldn’t, and can’t do to achieve them.
But if there are different statuses in different social situations, what happens 
when they come into conflict — when you have to play multiple different 
positions at the same time? It’s a frustrating situation, but you can try to 
avoid it by framing the situation to your benefit.

116
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
Stop frontin’: Switching 
roles, changing frames
As I mention in Chapter 5, the structure of a society defines the set of sta-
tuses that are available — and within a society, any given person may have a 
number of different statuses.
Most of the time, the roles associated with our various statuses are per-
fectly compatible. For example, my status as a Minnesotan does not conflict 
with my status as a teacher or my status as a brother. But once in a while, 
a person’s statuses will come into conflict. What would happen if my sister 
enrolled in my sociology class? I’d be facing a potential conflict because my 
role as a brother requires me to pay special attention to my sister — but my 
role as a teacher requires me to pay the same amount of attention to each 
student. Anticipating this kind of possibility, many companies have rules 
preventing people from supervising anyone they have a family tie or close 
personal relationship with.
You can’t make rules to prevent every role conflict, though — especially 
because social life is not like a baseball game where everyone wears a jersey 
with a number and team name. Roles are often ambiguous, and it’s up to each 
Frank Abagnale: A true player
The Steven Spielberg movie Catch Me If 
You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank 
Abagnale, a crook and a fraud who repeat-
edly eludes capture by the authorities. It’s a 
true story: Abagnale succeeded in convincing 
people that he was in turn an airline pilot, a 
doctor, and an attorney, also managing to cash 
tens of thousands of dollars in forged checks. 
(He even claims to have once posed as a soci-
ology professor. The nerve!)
The movie shows how easily Abagnale was 
able to convince people that he owned statuses 
he actually had little or no qualification for, just 
by acting as though he did. He walked right onto 
planes wearing a stolen pilot’s uniform, won the 
trust of doctors and nurses just by presenting 
himself as an authoritative physician, and easily 
cashed invalid checks because he so convinc-
ingly acted like a wealthy individual who would 
never need to forge a check.
Abagnale’s story is an extreme example of a 
person using social cues such as dress and 
vocabulary to take advantage of others, but 
everyone tries, every day, to use social cues to 
their advantage. You may dress a certain way 
for work, to portray yourself as competent and 
respectable; or you may act falsely aloof when 
you’re trying to impress a potential date, creat-
ing the impression that you’re a highly sought-
after partner who has no shortage of other 
romantic possibilities and will really need to be 
impressed if you’re going to ask someone out. 
You may even surprise yourself at how often 
those tricks work!

117
 Chapter 6: Microsociology: If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?
person to remember and manage their roles appropriately. Unless they’re 
very familiar with your identity and status(es), people around you are relying 
on you to communicate to them what your role is so they can respond appro-
priately. You can use this ambiguity to your advantage — in fact, to some 
extent everyone does.
The sociologist best known for writing about this is the late Erving Goffman, 
author of the 1956 book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Like Mead, 
Goffman was interested in the ways that individuals manage their behavior in 
social situations — but instead of a game, Goffman preferred to use the anal-
ogy of a theatrical performance.
When a person behaves a certain way in a certain social setting, Goffman 
said, it’s like wearing a mask: You’re acting a certain way to convince the 
people around you that you occupy a certain social position and ought to 
be treated accordingly. The stage is the social setting you’re in, which deter-
mines what “characters” are available to you.
Later, Goffman used the term frame to describe social situations — as in 
a frame that you put around a picture. Just as a picture frame influences 
people’s interpretation of the picture that goes in it, so a social frame influ-
ences people’s interpretation of a given interaction. Sometimes situations 
are naturally framed by the timing or location of an interaction, but in many 
cases frames are negotiated among people, with each person trying to apply 
the frame that most benefits him or her.
Here are some examples of how you can use social frames to your benefit:
 
✓ If you want to ask a stranger for money, you can start by making conver-
sation about some neutral thing like the weather. After you’ve struck up 
a little chat, the situation is framed as an interaction between acquain-
tances rather than between strangers. The other person’s role in your 
interaction is now that of an acquaintance, and the conventional rules 
of social interaction dictate that acquaintances should try to help each 
other when they can — whereas strangers have no obligation to do so.
 
✓ If you want to know whether a coworker might be interested in you 
romantically, you might ask one of their friends to accompany you on a 
coffee break. While you’re walking to the coffee shop, you might share 
some personal piece of information like what you did the past weekend. 
This helps remove the interaction from the frame of the office — where 
only official business information is normally exchanged — and puts it in 
the frame of a social outing, where personal information is more readily 
exchanged. That makes it more likely that information about romantic 
attractions will be divulged.

118
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
 
✓ If you’re operating a museum with free admission but want to encourage 
visitors to donate, you might require them to wait in line to get a ticket 
at a counter rather than simply letting them walk into the galleries. Even 
though they’re not forced to donate, when they are at a counter taking 
a ticket, it’s a situation so similar to situations where they’d be required 
to pay that it’s likely they’ll choose to donate much more often than if 
the situation was framed differently.
So people can choose to turn social situations to their benefit — but do they? 
As I explain in the previous section, often they do, but often they do not. 
That’s the paradox of society: you control it . . . but it also controls you. The 
great insight of the symbolic interactionists is that society fundamentally 
exists inside people’s heads; it’s something they negotiate among themselves 
every day.

The Power of Networks
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing society as a network
▶ Examining the strength of weak ties
▶ Gaining insights from network sociology
O
ne of the most important new ideas affecting sociology in the past few 
decades is the idea that society can be seen as a network, with each 
person being connected to a certain number of other people by professional 
or personal ties. Seeing society as a network has helped sociologists to 
understand everything from culture to power to markets.
In this chapter, I explain the basic insights of network sociology and describe 
some of the most important thinkers and studies in this tradition. I explain 
specifically how network sociology has changed the way sociologists think 
about the social world, and why network analysis is one of the most common 
tools used by sociologists today. Finally, I explain some of the specific ways 
network sociology might change the way you see your world — and how Web 
sites like Facebook and MySpace have made us all network sociologists. 
The Global Village: Seeing 
Society as a Network
Seeing society as a network is not too difficult intuitively, but it has taken 
sociologists many years — in fact, almost a century — to appreciate the 
way that network analysis can lend new insights into problems that have 
concerned sociologists since the time of Comte and before. In this section, I 
explain how sociologists have learned to use the tools of network analysis.

120
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
It’s all about you: Egocentric networks
In Chapter 6, I discuss some of the ways sociologists have studied individuals 
in their social world, While many sociologists continued — and continue — 
to focus on big-picture social facts, as Durkheim did, microsociologists have 
looked closely at individuals and how they negotiate a world of social sym-
bols and norms, with its maze of rules to learn, remember, and use.
But that left a gap in sociologists’ understanding of society: a gap between the 
level of societies overall — with their differing cultures and structures — and 
the level of the individual living in those cultures and structures. Network 
analysis, which grew out of the microsociological tradition, helps to connect 
the dots between the individual and society. What connects you to your soci-
ety? The people you know.
Think about your personal network. It may include:
 
✓ Your family: your parents, your siblings, your spouse or partner, your 
children.
 
✓ Your friends, old and new.
 
✓ Your coworkers and all the people you are professionally connected with.
 
✓ The web of acquaintances you encounter in your day-to-day life: the mail 
carrier, your dentist, the barista at your favorite coffee shop, the guy at 
the bus stop.
 
✓ People you may not know personally but who you know of through your 
own network. People who know the people you know — especially people 
who are close to people you are also close to and who you might hear 
about through them — might be considered a part of your network as well.
These are the people you have some connection to, however slight it may 
be. These are the people who in effect define “society” for you. All of your 
meaningful social interactions are with these people — with your interac-
tions being especially concentrated among the relatively few people who are 
closest to you.
Through mass media and other means, you may be able to collect informa-
tion from — and spread it to — people beyond your social network, but it’s 
the people in your personal network who constitute your most important 
conduits of information . . . and influence!
Your personal network is what sociologists refer to as an egocentric network. 
That doesn’t necessarily mean you have a big head; it’s a technical term refer-
ring to a social network as perceived from the standpoint of one individual. The 
first studies in network sociology were studies of egocentric networks because 
they’re relatively easy to study. If you’d actually listed the people I referred to 
in the previous list, I’d have a map of your egocentric network. (See Figure 7-1.)

But what about the people your contacts are connected to — the people you 
don’t know personally, but who you know through other contacts?
The game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,” in which players are challenged to 
connect Kevin Bacon to any given actor in Hollywood via chains of costars, is 
inspired by a longstanding conjecture that every person in the world is fewer 
than six degrees away from any other person, with each “degree” being a 
connection by personal acquaintance. Whomever I might name in the world, 
goes the theory, you at least know someone who knows someone who knows 
someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows her. It’s a 
tough theory to test, but a number of different studies have found that it’s at 
least roughly accurate.
In other words, you’re connected through chains of acquaintance to almost 
every person on Earth. But does it matter?
Yes and no. Certainly, in some cases multi-degree social connections can 
be valuable and meaningful (see the several examples elsewhere in this 
chapter) — but even a first-degree social connection is of limited use if it’s 
not very close. When I was applying to graduate school at Harvard, I asked 
an acquaintance who is a Harvard alumnus whether he would be willing to 
write me a letter of recommendation. “Um . . . sure,” he replied. “What we’re 
going to have to finesse, though, is the fact that I’ve only met you once.”

122
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
 
Sociologists often study networks of individual people, but network analysis 
can also be applied to networks of groups or organizations. For certain studies 
it may be useful to think of your family as being part of a network of families 
who live in the same neighborhood or attend the same church, or to think of 
your company as being part of a network of companies that do business with 
one another. The tools and strategies used to study networks of individuals 
can also be applied to networks of groups.
A web of relationships
Your network is large — it probably contains hundreds of people you could 
list offhand if you thought about it carefully and systematically, plus hun-
dreds more you wouldn’t even think to list (which is a problem for studies 
of egocentric networks), but it doesn’t include all the people in the world. In 
fact, it probably doesn’t even include everyone in your company or school, in 
your neighborhood or apartment building, or all the people you’re related to 
beyond first or second cousins.
Social networks and social manners: 
A rude awakening
David Gibson is a sociologist who is combining 
the insights of network analysis with the kind 
of microsociological observation that Erving 
Goffman and members of the Chicago School 
would appreciate.
In a study of a large banking corporation, 
Gibson first surveyed the bank’s employees 
to map the various social connections among 
them. He then sat in a series of meetings, qui-
etly observing how the different employees in 
the meeting interacted with one another. You 
might expect that the people who knew each 
other best would feel most free talking with one 
another and would exchange the most informa-
tion, but Gibson found that in fact that was not 
the case: A lot of conversation went on among 
people who were not closely connected. After 
all, the point of a meeting is to create a social 
situation where information is shared, and the 
people who worked most closely together had 
already shared a lot of information outside the 
meeting.
A good way of predicting which employees 
knew one another best, Gibson found, was to 
see which employees took one another’s turns 
in conversation. People who knew one another 
well might even seem to be rude to each other, 
answering questions asked of the other person 
and interrupting him or her when she was talking.
You can observe this effect at parties. Watch 
people who are close friends or romantic part-
ners; they’ll often stand beside one another 
in conversational circles and field questions 
together, interrupting each other in a (hopefully) 
friendly fashion to clarify details or add anec-
dotes. They’ve become so close that they’re 
essentially functioning as a single conversa-
tional unit. If one of them interrupted someone 
else, though . . . now that would be rude!

123
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
Imagine drawing a network map of your school or the company where you 
work. There would be a dot for each individual, and each individual would 
be connected to each individual they know personally. You can imagine that 
there would be clusters of tight-knit groups — cliques of friends or cowork-
ers who all know one another well — and that each person in a cluster would 
share some number of connections to people outside the cluster. If you could 
actually draw every personal connection in your school or company, you 
would have a complete network map of that organization. (See Figure 7-2.)

And then, of course, each individual in that organization maintains a large 
number of connections outside the organization: family, friends, former 
coworkers. Those connections link your organization to many more organiza-
tions, and ultimately to every other company or school on Earth.
It’s exciting to think that you’re probably somehow linked to almost every 
other person on earth, but of course so is everyone else (see sidebar). Your 
position in a network is a limitation as well as an asset. A social network 
isn’t like the Internet, where information can freely whip from one end of the 
network to the next . . . and actually, it doesn’t always work that way on the 
Internet, either.
You can only maintain so many meaningful social connections; there are prob-
ably no more than several hundred people you would recognize and greet 
by name if you passed them on the street, and there are many fewer people 
who you actually see regularly and have substantial interactions with. One of 
the most important insights of network analysis is that it’s that small circle 
of people, rather than the total number of people who belong to the social 
groups you’re nominally a part of, who really define your social situation.
The Strength of Weak Ties
When you look at a social group as a network of connected individual nodes, 
it changes the way you think about both the group and the individual. You 
can see any given individual’s place in the social structure, and you can 
see exactly where their lines of information and influence are arranged. 
Information and influence normally don’t flash through a group like wildfire; 
they flow like water trickling through a series of streams.
In this section, I describe some important discoveries sociologists have made 
about social networks; and the discoveries’ implications for individuals who 
want to strategically position themselves in their own social networks.
Why your acquaintances are more 
valuable than your best friends
This section takes its title from a 1973 article by sociologist Mark Granovetter, 
which has become one of the most influential publications in all of sociology. 
Granovetter was studying the process of job seeking: How do people find jobs? 
It’s a natural subject for network analysis because jobs are very often found 
through personal connections.

125
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
In Chapter 6 I explain the concept of bounded rationality in markets: You 
don’t have perfect information about all the products available for purchase, 
so you need to decide how much time it’s worth taking to gather information. 
Job seeking works under the same principle, even more so than buying a car 
or another consumer product.
Many jobs are publicly listed online or in newspapers, but many are publi-
cized to only a limited audience, so there are a large number of jobs you’re 
not going to find out about by surfing Craigslist. Further, when you do find 
a job you’re interested in and qualified for, it helps tremendously to have a 
personal connection with someone at the company where you would like to 
work. That person can both supply you with detailed information about the 
job and, often, increase your chances of being hired by recommending you to 
the hiring committee.
In mapping network ties, Granovetter made the crucial decision to distin-
guish between strong ties and weak ties.
 
✓ Strong ties are your most intense personal connections: your connec-
tions to your closest family members and friends. People with whom 
you share strong ties are people you know very well; you may live with 
them or talk with them daily.
 
✓ Weak ties are all your other social connections: your connections to 
people you know, but don’t know particularly well. Coworkers, class-
mates, neighbors, most friends — you might not talk to or see these 
people very often, but you know them and they know you.
Granovetter’s finding — which, like many important sociological discoveries, 
was surprising at the time but seemed like common sense after it was estab-
lished — was that for job-seeking purposes, your strong ties are actually not 
all that valuable to you. 
Why? Because your closeness to them means that you already know every-
thing — and just about everyone — they know. If there’s a job opening they 
know about, you probably know about it already. If they have a good “in” 
with a particular company, you probably know that person, too.
 
From a network perspective, your strong ties are redundant. That is, by and 
large they connect you with people you have other connections to. For exam-
ple, your spouse may have introduced you to all their friends and family when 
you first met, but after years of marriage, you’ve formed your own connections 
with those people. If your spouse were to die, devastating as that would be 
from an emotional standpoint, from a social network perspective your network 
would not be much changed despite the fact that you’ve lost your strongest tie.
From a network perspective, it might be worse to lose your socialite friend, 
with whom you have only a weak tie but who connects you to many people 
you might never encounter otherwise. It’s your weak ties that help you out 

126
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
when you look for a job because they are connected to many people you 
have no acquaintance with and they can, therefore, supply you with much 
more information. Plus, there are many more of them: you can maintain only 
a few strong ties, but you may have hundreds of weak ties, each of whom rep-
resents an entire world of potentially useful connections.
Think, for example, of a cousin who lives in another neighborhood and whom 
you see only once a year at the annual family reunion. From a network per-
spective, that cousin is essentially spending all the other 364 days of the year 
working for you — meeting new people with whom you’re not acquainted, 
learning new information that you don’t know. When you’re looking for a job, 
you can call on them to help you out. So, in this way, your acquaintances may 
be more valuable than your best friends.
Of course, just because information can flow through a network tie doesn’t 
mean that it does. Sociologists today appreciate that even where weak ties 
exist, they’re no good unless they’re activated. People may have a reason to 
hide information from you — they may have a stake in keeping that informa-
tion to themselves — but more likely, they just don’t think to tell you. You 
don’t share much knowledge with most of your weak ties … that’s exactly 
what makes them weak ties. If you want to activate your network of weak ties, 
you’re probably going to have to put some effort into it.
Companies are well aware of this, which is one reason they pay their employ-
ees for successful job candidate referrals. It may seem odd to think that 
anyone would need an incentive to tell a job-seeking friend about a good 
opportunity, but in fact there are several reasons you might fail to spread 
information about job openings at your own company.
You may worry that suggesting a job opening will offend your friend by 
making it seem like they need help.
Most people have hundreds of acquaintances that they rarely speak to; if 
you haven’t talked with someone in a couple of years, it may be awkward to 
pick up the phone and suggest that they apply for a job at your company.
You may just forget.
This is why companies feel the need to offer incentives to help motivate their 
employees to pick up the phone and let their friends know about job openings.
But how much should a company pay for a successful referral? Sociologist 
Alexandra Marin studied the pay-for-referral process at a large company, 
and in the end she found that companies should save their highest referral 
bonuses for the least specific positions. Why? Because a position with very 
specific qualifications (say, someone familiar with a specific programming 
language) requires a very specific type of applicant. If you happen to know 
one who’s looking for a job, you’re likely to pass the information on, but a 
job with very general qualifications (say, a “project manager”) is less likely to 

127
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
fire any immediate light bulbs in your head, and you may need a little more 
incentive to reach out to potential candidates for that job.
This is an example of how different kinds of information flow through differ-
ent kinds of network connections. You may see your neighbor every day and 
be acutely aware of when she gets a new haircut or buys a new car, but have 
no idea of what her job qualifications may be — whereas you may be familiar 
with a former coworker’s job qualifications but have no idea whether he has 
a new haircut, a new spouse, or even whether he’s living or dead. Separating 
“strong ties” from “weak ties” makes sense, but it doesn’t do justice to the 
complexity of human relationships.
Find a structural hole and jump in!
You’re probably already starting to see the tremendous value of network 
analysis for businesspeople. In the business world, information is money: a 
tip about anything from a cheap supplier to a competitor’s marketing cam-
paign to an under-the-table merger discussion can inform strategic decisions 
that might yield millions of dollars in profits. Where does this information 
come from? You might catch it on TV or in the newspaper, but that’s informa-
tion everyone knows. The most profitable information likely comes through 
network connections that provide “inside” information.
And it isn’t just information that travels through network connections — it’s 
influence as well. If you have a connection at another company, you can pos-
sibly ask your connection to prod that company to do business with yours, 
to shun a competitor, or to hold off on the launch of a product.
So clearly, any businessperson wants to increase their personal network . . . 
but it doesn’t make sense to just add contacts willy-nilly. For one thing, you 
can’t productively maintain an overly large number of social ties (even weak 
ones), so you have to pick and choose. For another thing, everyone wants to 
feel special, and if you’re “friends” with everyone, well, everyone is likely to 
know that and will not consider you a particularly special friend. Good luck 
exercising influence in that situation!
The question, then, becomes which network ties you want to build and main-
tain. Sociologist Ronald Burt’s research suggests that you pay particular 
attention to building ties across “structural holes.”
What’s a structural hole? Think about a network map, with dense clusters of 
people who know one another well and just a relatively few ties connecting 
those clusters. Between some clusters, there may be no ties at all. For Burt, 
these places where not many ties exist are structural holes — gaps in the net-
work structure. The best-positioned people in a network, says Burt, are not 
the people at the center of dense clusters but rather the people who fill the 
structural holes.

128
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
The people at the center of dense clusters may know a lot of people well, but 
if it’s a close-knit group — say, a small company — all those other people 
know each other well, too, and don’t have to rely on any one person for 
information. You don’t actually need to know that many people, Burt’s work 
suggests, or even know them very well, just so long as they don’t know each 
other. When that’s the case, each group relies on you for information about 
the other group. You have information both groups want, and you can sell 
that information at a profit.
This may sound nefarious, like being a double agent spying for two different 
countries. A double-agent superspy is certainly filling a structural hole . . . but 
then, so are all these people:
 
✓ Movie producers: connecting filmmakers with actors, studios, financial 
backers, and other groups necessary to make a movie.
 
✓ Realtors: connecting house buyers and house sellers.
 
✓ High school counselors: connecting students and college admission 
officers.
Inside information: It’s a good thing
In December 2001, homemaking maven Martha 
Stewart sold all her shares of stock in a drug 
company called ImClone. Her timing was 
extremely good because shortly after Stewart’s 
divestment it was announced that a key product 
ImClone was developing had not been approved 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) — news that caused the stock price to 
plummet. Had she not sold the stock, Stewart 
would have lost nearly $50,000. Stewart’s deci-
sion later attracted scrutiny because her friend 
Sam Waksal, ImClone’s CEO, had known about 
the FDA decision before it was made public. 
Stewart was found guilty of lying to the govern-
ment in a subsequent investigation and spent 
time in jail, though she continued to maintain 
that she had not received any inside informa-
tion from Waksal.
Why would it be a problem if she had received 
a tip from her friend? Because in the United 
States and most other countries, it is illegal to 
exchange certain kinds of information about 
publicly held companies. That law exists to 
even the playing field between the Martha 
Stewarts of the world, who know many power-
ful people, and the rest of us, who don’t.
The law against “insider trading” is, in effect, 
the government’s official acknowledgement 
that network ties can be a source of profit. 
There is supposed to be one official bridge — 
the corporate spokesperson — between the 
cluster of people who know what’s happening 
in a company and the many people who invest 
in that company. Through her friend Sam, 
Martha Stewart had a network tie bridging that 
structural hole: a tie that she allegedly cashed 
in on to the tune of about $50,000 at the expense 
of the people she sold the stock to, people who 
didn’t have access to the information she did.
This is an extreme case of a valuable network 
tie, but all your network ties are potentially 
valuable . . . especially the ones you keep to 
yourself.

129
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
 
✓ Political lobbyists: connecting legislators and groups who want to influ-
ence them. (This is why so many former legislators become lobbyists — 
they’re essentially selling their personal connections to sitting legislators.)
People in all these professions, and many more, earn a lot of their salary 
simply by knowing people who have an interest in knowing one another — or 
at least knowing about one another. You pay them to bridge network holes 
that you want to cross.
This principle of filling structural holes doesn’t only work in business, though — 
it works in personal life as well. Say you’re a teenager looking for a party. There 
are probably one or two parties this weekend that a lot of people at your school 
are going to — but that’s also probably true of every other school in town. 
To find the best parties, you’d rather have five acquaintances at five different 
schools than ten close friends at your own school.
Insights from Network Analysis
Now you have a basic sense of what network analysis is and how it works. 
The connections among people in a social group form a structure, along 
which information and influence can be traced. How does thinking about 
society in this way change the way sociologists think about social life? What 
specific insights has this approach yielded? 
In this section, I explain how network analysis has changed the way sociolo-
gists think about the spread of behaviors and the spread of information, and 
concludes with a discussion of sites like Facebook and MySpace that make 
social networks visible — to the endless fascination of their millions of users.
The difference between “your 
society” and your society
Network analysis has been an important tool for sociologists in recent 
decades because it opens up a whole world of inquiry that didn’t previously 
exist. Before network analysis became widely used, there were two main 
ways of studying society.
 
✓ Top-down, or macrosociological, analysis is the study of social groups 
considered as entire units. For example, Karl Marx’s argument about the 
historical rise of capitalism and Max Weber’s argument about increasing 
rationalization across all of society are macrosociological arguments. 
When Emile Durkheim said sociologists needed to focus on “social facts,” 
he was saying that they should pay attention to the big picture rather 
than individuals in society. (See Chapter 3 for more on these ideas.)

130
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
 
✓ Bottom-up, or microsociological, analysis is the study of individuals in 
their social worlds. The Chicago School studies of people from differ-
ent groups interacting on the street were studies in microsociology, 
and when Erving Goffman wrote about the different “masks” we wear in 
different social contexts, that was a microsociological argument. (See 
Chapter 6 for more on microsociology.)
Network analysis allows sociologists to focus on the connective tissue 
between individuals and society. To talk about “your society” is to say that 
there’s some social group that you are “a member of” and are somehow influ-
enced by. That’s pretty vague! Where does this influence come from? Do you 
somehow inhale it, or get psychic vibes from the fifth dimension?
It’s true that there are some forms of social influence that affect people 
across an entire society (for example, mass media), but the most important 
influence comes from the people you know personally and directly encoun-
ter. In this way, network analysis helps sociologists appreciate that your 
actual society — that is, the people you actually interact with and are influ-
enced by — can be quite different than “your society.”
Here’s an example of how this insight has been put into practice. It’s well-
known that obesity is a growing problem in the United States, and for obvi-
ous reasons, medical professionals would like to know why. There are a 
couple of society-wide (no pun intended) culprits that are probably involved: 
Unhealthy food is becoming ever cheaper and more available relative to 
healthy food, and advertising campaigns for unhealthy food downplay the 
risk of obesity. Still, can those factors entirely explain the rise in obesity? 
Why is the risk especially high among certain groups?
Nicholas Christakis, a sociologist who’s also a physician, worked with 
network analysis expert James Fowler to study the spread of obesity in a 
Massachusetts town over three decades. Christakis and Fowler discovered 
that obesity could be observed to spread through social networks. In effect, 
it seems, you can “catch” obesity by befriending people who are overweight. 
As more and more people become overweight, obesity spreads through their 
networks to become a growing epidemic.
What the researchers’ obesity study (among other network studies over 
many years) has proved is that social networks can be conduits for the 
spread of everything from information to influence to behavior, influenc-
ing people’s lives at every level. If you’re trying to stay fit, it doesn’t help 
that your grocery store will sell you a box of cookies for less than the price 
of an apple, that you see ads everywhere for unhealthy foods, or that your 
job probably involves you sitting still at a desk for eight hours a day — but 
what’s really devastating is when the people around you are practicing 
unhealthy behaviors, overeating, and under-exercising. That makes it seem 
normal and, in fact, good for you to do the same thing.

131
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
Think about the implications of this finding for other important behaviors 
that might be socially influenced:
 
✓ Drug use: Do your friends abuse drugs, or do they stay clear of danger-
ous substances?
 
✓ Sexual health: Do your friends have casual sex — and if they do, do they 
use protection?
 
✓ Economic stability: Do your friends gamble? Do they make risky invest-
ments? Do they max out their credit cards?
 
✓ Study habits: Do your friends devote time and attention to their school-
work, or do they blow it off?
These are just a few examples of potentially hazardous behaviors that are 
probably spread through social networks.
The significance of social networks in this respect is in some respects an incon-
venient truth. If there were one or two factors that caused a social problem by 
affecting everyone equally, the problem could be solved by taking those fac-
tors away. If a problem is spread through social networks, though, you’d have 
to cut the network off to keep the problem from spreading — like digging a 
trench around a forest fire. Not only is that unethical, it’s probably impossible.
 
It’s also important to remember, though, that just because one person — or 
even many people — you’re connected to behaves a certain way, you’ll auto-
matically “get the message” and act on it. You may be getting different mes-
sages from different people.
In a study of teenagers in Boston, sociologist David Harding found that it was 
true that teens who made risky decisions were getting messages consistent 
with those decisions — for example, their friends might be telling them that 
staying in school wasn’t worth it — but they were also often getting “the right 
messages” from their teachers, their parents, and even many of their friends, 
who encouraged them to graduate and get jobs or go to college.
The problem wasn’t that troubled teens were getting only “the wrong mes-
sages.” The problem was that they were getting mixed messages, giving 
them different scripts to follow (as Goffman might say) in challenging situa-
tions. Sometimes they chose the “wrong” script — have risky sex, drop out 
of school — and sometimes they chose the “right” script. Kids who weren’t 
getting those mixed signals had a much easier time sticking to one course 
of action.
Harding’s study wasn’t a study of social networks in the technical sense, but it 
did incorporate the basic insight of network analysis: that our social connec-
tions are important influences on our behavior. What happens when our social 
connections send us mixed signals? It’s an empirical question that sociologists 
conducting network analyses may be paying a lot more attention to in the future.

Opening the channels of communication
If information and influence spread through social networks, is there a way to 
spread messages more efficiently?
In the great sociologist Emile Durkheim’s classic study of suicide (see 
Chapter 3), he basically took for granted that all members of a given society 
shared a set of norms and values. If you live in a Protestant-majority society, 
then he assumed that you probably have Protestant-majority values.
 
Durkheim has been criticized for committing the ecological fallacy, which is 
to assume that because something is true of a system it’s true of all that sys-
tem’s members. Durkheim observed that Protestant-majority countries had 
higher suicide rates than Catholic-majority countries, which he took to mean 
that Protestants were more likely than Catholics to commit suicide. But those 
data didn’t actually tell him that: How did he know that it wasn’t the minority-
group Catholics committing suicide — maybe as a result of persecution by 
the majority-group Protestants? He didn’t. He just assumed, and he may have 
assumed incorrectly. (We’ll never know.) Durkheim’s study remains an influ-
ential landmark in sociology, but a sociologist today would be much less likely 
to make that kind of assumption.
The German sociologist Georg Simmel, whose most important work came 
shortly after Durkheim’s, was a big influence on microsociology and has 
come to be regarded as one of the fathers of network analysis. Simmel 
focused closely on individual interaction and argued that there are different 
forms of social interaction, with different rules and norms and through which 
different types of information are spread.
The moral for those with a message to spread is that it may be a waste of 
energy to try to broadcast it over an entire social group. What you want to do 
is make sure your message is heard — and passed on — by the right people 
in the right settings.
This implication of network analysis has been appreciated not only by sociol-
ogists studying the spread of ideas and behavior (see previous section), but 
by marketers looking to sell their products. Here are some marketing strate-
gies you’ve probably come across; each is inspired by the idea of society as a 
network:
 
✓ Distributing free samples of products. If you play a free CD and enjoy it, 
you may play it for your friends and introduce them to the artist as well.
 
✓ Sponsoring events where influential people are likely to gather. Many 
companies sponsor parties or concerts for young people, in the belief 
that young people can influence older people to use a product — but not 
vice-versa.

133
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
 
✓ Using social media (for example, networking tools such as Facebook 
or Twitter) to encourage individuals to willingly spread marketing 
messages. Distributing — often online — a video, song, or game that 
advertises your product but is also entertaining enough that it might be 
willingly passed on to friends is a practice called “viral marketing.”
These techniques can obviously be used to make profits, but they’ve also 
become popular with nonprofit organizations promoting health, environmen-
tal awareness, charity, and other good causes. Going through social networks 
is often an extremely effective way to spread a message, and both sociolo-
gists and marketers have taken note.
In journalist Malcolm Gladwell’s popular book The Tipping Point, he writes 
about the phenomenon by which an idea or behavior (like, say, wearing Hush 
Puppy loafers) quickly goes from being relatively rare to being wildly popu-
lar. Gladwell argues that a few key types of people — people he refers to as 
mavens, salesmen, and connectors — need to get hold of an idea and help to 
spread it.
Gladwell’s book isn’t a sociological study, and he provides only examples 
(rather than systematically analyzed data) to make his point, but sociologists 
have read and appreciated Gladwell’s book for its compelling argument that 
social networks are profoundly important in the spread of everything from 
clothing fads to musical tastes to business practices.
Gladwell’s idea of a “connector” is similar to Ronald Burt’s idea of a person 
filling a structural hole (discussed earlier in this chapter). A connector is 
a person who knows many different people from many different groups, so 
they are in a position to spread ideas or trends from one group to the other.
Just as biological epidemics caused by dangerous viruses can spread by way 
of people who move freely from one group to the next, so can social epidem-
ics spread through social connectors — people who can “catch” an idea in 
one group and then spread it to the next group. When an idea or behavior 
spreads to multiple different social groups, it’s become a social epidemic. This 
may be a good thing or a bad thing — depending on, say, whether you think 
Hush Puppies are attractive shoes — but it is the way the social world works.
Social networking online: Making 
the invisible visible
If you’re a member of a social networking site like Facebook or MySpace, 
you’ve probably thought about it multiple times while reading this chapter — 
and, in fact, while reading this entire book. Social networking sites are a sub-
ject of fascination for sociologists and for just about everyone who partici-
pates on them.

134
Part II: Seeing Society Like a Sociologist 
These sites normally allow each user to create an online profile, which they 
can then link to their friends’ profiles. The result is a visible display of some-
thing that’s normally invisible: a social network. These sites’ incredible draw — 
they now involve hundreds of millions of users around the world — is evidence 
of how important social networks are in people’s lives.
Next time you’re on your favorite social networking site — whichever it 
may be — consider how people’s behavior on the site illustrates these 
sociological ideas.
The presentation of self
As I describe in Chapter 6, sociologists observe how we play roles in society — 
like actors on a stage, as Erving Goffman would put it. A user’s profile is a per-
fect example of this. Unlike in face-to-face interaction, a user has perfect con-
trol over the “face” they present on a social networking site. They can choose 
which pictures to display, what information to divulge, and which acquain-
tances to acknowledge.
A lot of the most stressful moments on social networking sites come from 
tension and cracks in this careful presentation of self. A friend might post 
something on your profile that you would prefer not be visible, your mom 
might post an embarrassing photo from when you were an awkward teen-
ager, or your boss may see pictures of you doing something, oh . . . let’s just 
say unprofessional. All of these things get in the way of your attempt to filter 
the information about you that is known by the world.
The diversity of social ties
Social networking sites clearly demonstrate a principle that network sociolo-
gists have been trying for decades to grapple with: There are as many differ-
ent kinds of relationships as there are pairs of people in the world, and no 
matter how many different options a networking site offers you, there will be 
a lot of relationships that are awkward to manage.
On Facebook, for example, as of this writing you can be a “fan” of a public 
figure, can specify that you’re a son or daughter or mother or father of one of 
your family members, and can be in one of several flavors of involvement (“In 
a relationship,” “Engaged,” “Married,” “It’s complicated”) with one significant 
other — but beyond that, everyone you’re connected to is just a “friend.” So 
your “friends” might include:
Your best friend
Your boss
Your grandpa

135
 Chapter 7: Caught in the Web: The Power of Networks
Someone you have a huge crush on
Your ex-boyfriend
Your ex-boyfriend’s sister
Your best friend from kindergarten who you haven’t talked to in 15 years
In reality you have very different relationships with all those people, but on 
Facebook they’re all your “friends.” If a distant relative keeps making inap-
propriate comments on your profile, you’re going to have to confront her 
or de-friend her. You can’t publicly note that your relationship to her is not 
“friend” but rather “crazy second cousin once removed.”
The transitivity of social ties
“Transitivity” is a technical word that basically means “transferability.” 
In other words, if you have a close social tie, your other close friends are 
liable to “catch” that tie. Mark Granovetter writes about what he calls “the 
forbidden triad” — a situation where one person has close ties to each of 
two other people, who don’t know one another. (See Figure 7-3.) He calls 
it “forbidden” not because it’s actually forbidden, but because it’s just so 
unlikely to happen.
Social networking sites can speed the “healing” of forbidden triads. If you 
have two good friends who both often comment on your profile, they’re apt 
to come to know one another and even start a conversation — maybe about 
you! If that feels weird . . . well, maybe it’s your own fault for not introducing 
your friends to one another.

The spread of information through social networks
As if gossip didn’t spread quickly enough before the Internet, it spreads like 
wildfire now. If one of your friends posts a picture of you making out with 
someone you met at a party, all your friends will know about it, more or less 
immediately. This is true of other information as well, including information 
on breaking national and international news, information about funny videos, 
and even false information about supposed scams and other urban legends.
The principle that most information spreads most efficiently and effectively 
through social networks was true before the development of the Internet; 
although the Internet has made it theoretically easier to broadcast something 
to a mass audience (everyone in the world could read your personal blog 
right now if they wanted to), it’s also made social networks more important 
because it’s increased the efficiency of spreading information through them. 
People still trade information over the backyard fence and around the water 
cooler, as they always have, but now the backyard fence and the water cooler 
are online, and you don’t need to wait until you’re thirsty to get the latest 
scoop. All you have to do is log on.
Online friendships: Trading quality for quantity?
As technologies such as cell phones, laptops, 
and wireless networks have proliferated, many 
people have voiced concerns about the effect 
those technologies are having on “real world” 
relationships. Ever since the telephone was 
invented, people have been concerned that 
technologies that make it easier to connect 
with people far away will distract from people’s 
relationships with others who are nearby.
Although it may seem like your little brother is 
always chatting online and never wants to talk 
with his actual family, the fact of the matter 
is that he probably wouldn’t be much more 
enthused about talking with his family even if 
the alternative was sitting out on the stoop and 
watching traffic go by. Historical and sociologi-
cal evidence from the past century suggests 
that as technology makes communication 
easier, what happens is that there’s simply 
more communication . . . with everyone.
Think about your own life. Who do you talk 
with most on the phone, trade the most texts 
with, chat with most online, and trade the 
most Facebook wall posts with? Chances are, 
it’s your girlfriend or roommate or best buddy: 
someone you often see in person. You probably 
also communicate quite often with people far 
away, and you probably do a lot more of that 
than people did before the development of cell 
phones and the Internet — but that doesn’t 
necessarily mean you’re neglecting your close 
relationships with people you actually encoun-
ter in person on a daily basis. You’re probably 
just supplementing them with far-flung friends.
Sociologists and psychologists are still gather-
ing data on how social networking sites and 
related technologies affect people’s relation-
ships, rather than merely reflecting them . . . but 
in general, people seem to use those technolo-
gies to grow closer to a wide range of people 
they value. It’s not an either/or proposition.

Par t III
Equality and 
Inequality in Our 
Diverse World

In this part . . .
A
ny society is made up of many parts — and which 
“part” you belong to isn’t always obvious. Do I 
belong to the middle-class part of American society? The 
white part? The male part? The Catholic part? The law-
abiding part? In this section, I explain how sociologists 
understand the lines that divide a society.

Chapter 8
Social Stratification: 
We’re All Equal, But Some of Us 
Are More Equal Than Others
In This Chapter
▶ Excavating the social strata
▶ Understanding the many means of inequality
▶ Climbing up and falling down
T
he title of this chapter refers to George Orwell’s Animal Farm, a novel 
that is an allegory meant to show how difficult it is to create a society 
where everyone’s truly equal. In the book, animals in a barnyard drive the 
farmer out and try to create a social order where all animals are equal. 
Eventually, the pigs start taking advantage of their leadership position and 
justify their special privileges by the dictum: “All animals are equal, but some 
animals are more equal than others.”
The story rings true because no society, ever, has been completely equal. 
Social inequality is a topic at the heart of sociology, and in this chapter I 
explain why.
First, I explain how sociologists think, in general, about inequality — and why 
it may be a necessary feature of society. Next, I go through the many differ-
ent means of inequality: all the different ways people manage to draw social 
boundaries that privilege some at the expense of others. Finally, I look at how 
inequality changes over time — both for individuals (social mobility) and for 
entire societies.

Excavating the Social Strata
The word “stratification” is a geological term referring to the way that layers 
of earth and rock are stacked on top of one another. Social stratification refers 
to social groups being similarly stacked on top of one another. In this section, 
I discuss how sociologists think about social inequality in general, and then 
explain the debate over whether inequality is necessary.
Understanding social inequality
What does it mean to be “unequal” in society? From a sociological perspec-
tive, it means having unequal access to social resources. In other words, you 
and I are unequal if one of us has, or is able to get, more of some desirable 
resource than the other one has. These resources might include:
 
✓ Material possessions: Anything from food to shelter to luxury items.
 
✓ Money: Currency or credit that can be exchanged for goods.
 
✓ Power: The ability to influence others to do as you want.
 
✓ Prestige: Interested and respectful treatment by others.
 
✓ Relationships: Access, whether personal or professional, to people of 
value.
These are resources that you might reasonably want in society, but that you 
probably have less access to than others. Just how many others have more 
access than you to these things depends on where you stack up in the strati-
fication order of your society.
As it happens, having more of these resources puts you in a better position 
to get more of them — in most societies, advantages are multiplicative, mean-
ing that if you’re relatively high in the stratification order, you have access 
to a lot of resources that will help you stay there. If you’re relatively low in 
the stratification order, on the other hand, you may have a hard time climb-
ing up. People with a lot of money, for example, are able to invest in business 
ventures that can earn them even more money; people without money have 
to work for pay and take whatever their employers pay them.
But there isn’t just a single dimension of stratification: You can’t just add 
up all the different resources you have and come up with a single score or a 
number or even a category that completely sums up where you stand in the 
stratification order. There are many different bases of social inequality — 
people are where they are in the stratification order for a number of different 

141
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
reasons that may persist no matter how much power or money they have. If, 
for example, you are a racial minority in a society that discriminates against 
racial minorities, you’re going to have an obstacle to face no matter what you 
achieve in life. (See sidebar, “Locking the Gates.”)
In the next section of this chapter, I discuss several different common bases 
of social stratification: money, occupation, ability, motivation, connections, 
credentials, specialized knowledge, race, sex, caste, and age. These are all 
ways people may be different from one another that may lead to having dif-
ferent positions in a society’s stratification order — but not all differences 
among people lead to differences in stratification. I have a birthmark on my 
chest; that makes me unique, but in my society that difference is not apt 
to lead to either an advantage or a disadvantage in the stratification order. 
Some people may find it ugly and some people may find it attractive, but 
either way it’s probably not going to make it any easier or more difficult for 
me to find a job or to influence others.
It’s conceivable that there might be a society where it would matter: societ-
ies differ, sometimes dramatically, in how the stratification system works. 
Some of these differences are formal differences (that is, differences written 
into the legal system and organizational rules, like whether or not slavery is 
legal) and others are informal differences (that is, rules that are not written 
down but are nonetheless meaningful, like whether or not racism pervades 
a society). The bottom line is that each society has its own system of social 
stratification, and those systems vary over time.
Sociologists divide bases of stratification into two categories.
Ascribed bases of stratification are attributes that you’re born with, and 
that society judges you upon — for example, your physical appearance 
(including your race), your place of origin, and your caste, if you live in a 
caste system.
Achieved bases of stratification are attributes over which you have at 
least some control: your job, your social connections, your education, 
your wealth. These attributes may change over the course of your life.
To make things even more complicated, different bases may matter in dif-
ferent places and at different times, and they may interact with one another 
to determine your place in the stratification system. For example, some jobs 
may be more advantageous for women than for men, and vice-versa. Social 
stratification is quite complex, but it’s worth taking the time to understand 
because it’s so very important to everyone — in any society.
 
It’s easy to be confused when talking about “social class.” The word “class” is 
typically used to refer to differences in a society’s stratification order, what-
ever that may be. If you’re “upper class,” you are relatively privileged. If you’re 

142
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
“lower class,” you’re relatively unprivileged. When people use these terms in 
reference to modern capitalist society, they’re generally referring to money 
matters. “Upper-class” people have more money than “lower-class” people.
But class is about more than money, even in industrial capitalist societies. 
A librarian and a steelworker may make about the same amount of money, 
but does that mean they’re in the same class? A lot of people would say no, 
which is why many sociologists prefer to link “class” with occupation rather 
than with income alone.
Even more factors could be considered. It gets so complicated, in fact, that 
people don’t even know their own class; if you define “middle class” as being 
in the middle third of a society by income level, many more people consider 
themselves “middle class” than actually are. The fact of the matter is that 
in most societies there’s no hard-and-fast definition of the social order that 
everyone can agree on, so the question of what “classes” are — and which 
people belong in which class — will always be a matter of some debate.
The perennial debate: Is 
inequality necessary?
Orwell’s animals aren’t the only ones to wonder whether social inequality is 
necessary. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a society where everyone is equal — 
where no one is privileged over anyone else?
Among sociologists, Karl Marx most famously called for the creation of a 
society where everyone would be equal. In Marx’s communist utopia, people 
might do different jobs, but no one would be locked into a job that made 
them miserable. People would receive the resources they needed to meet 
their basic needs and have whatever luxuries might be available, but no one 
would reap rewards on the backs of others. “From each according to his abil-
ity,” wrote Marx, and “to each according to his needs.”
But how would the dirty work get done? It would ideally be like in a family: 
when you see something that needs doing, you do it and then no one else will 
get stuck with the job. Other family members would turn around and do the 
same for you.
Anyone who’s ever lived in a family, though, knows that’s not always how it 
works . . . could that system ever work on the scale of an entire society? Most 
sociologists think not. Not only is it questionable in theory, what empirical 
evidence exists suggests that it’s untenable. (See sidebar, “Misadventures in 
socialism.”)

143
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
The most notorious sociological argument for the necessity of social strati-
fication — that is, inequality — was made in 1945 by functionalists Kingsley 
Davis and Wilbert E. Moore. Davis and Moore were frank about the fact that 
people are of differing abilities, and that society has an interest in matching 
the most-able people with the most-important jobs. If someone has a brilliant 
mind and an exceptionally steady hand, it might benefit thousands of people 
for that person to become a surgeon . . . but what if she doesn’t want to be a 
surgeon? If surgeons are paid significantly more than people in less critical 
jobs, that provides people with an incentive to compete for jobs as surgeons; 
that way, the most able can be chosen rather than the job just going to 
whomever wants it.
Further, Davis and Moore pointed out, after a person is in a job, they need 
to be motivated to work hard — and there’s no motivation like the threat of 
losing your job and ending up on the street. If people are allowed to do what-
ever they want, whenever they want, they’ll be too tempted to be lazy and 
very little will actually get done.
Locking the Gates
Henry Louis Gates Jr., a black man, is one of the 
most respected academics in the world: chair 
of Harvard’s Department of Afro-American 
Studies, he is the author of many books and 
is often seen on television speaking about the 
black experience in America. He draws an 
appropriately handsome salary, and he owns a 
house in a wealthy neighborhood in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts.
One night in summer 2009, Prof. Gates came 
home to find that he’d accidentally been locked 
out of his house. He and a friend opened a 
window to crawl in, and a neighbor who could 
see only that two men were climbing through 
the window of the house called the police. 
When the police arrived, they asked Gates to 
provide identification proving that he owned 
the house. He became indignant, and was ulti-
mately placed under arrest, though he was later 
released and no charges were filed against him.
Gates accused the white police officer who 
arrested him of racism, igniting a national 
debate. In the 21st century, was America still a 
place where a man — even a wealthy, famous 
man like Prof. Gates — could get arrested just 
for being black? It’s impossible to know if the 
incident would have gone differently had it 
been a white man breaking into his own house, 
but in the wake of the incident many African-
Americans came forward to cite examples of 
racial discrimination they faced every day. The 
discussion about the incident made clear to the 
entire country that in the United States — just 
as in every other country — social stratifica-
tion is not just a matter of what job you have, or 
how much money you make, or the color of your 
skin. All of those attributes matter, though just 
how much they matter varies from one situation 
to the next.

144
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
So, to sum up Davis and Moore’s argument:
People need to be motivated to work hard and to take the jobs they’re 
best suited for.
Motivation means reward . . . and the real possibility of having signifi-
cantly more or less reward.
Because there need to be people who are rewarded more than others, 
there needs to be inequality.
It seems to make a lot of sense, but Davis and Moore’s article has become 
one of the most-criticized in all of sociology. Why? Many sociologists believe 
Davis and Moore’s argument justifies the status quo. (The same criticism was 
leveled at their colleague Talcott Parsons; see Chapter 3.)
Just because people may need some motivation to work hard doesn’t mean 
that the amount of inequality present in most societies is necessary or 
humane. Plus, the system of financial reward as it actually exists doesn’t 
Misadventures in socialism
As I explain in Chapter 4, one of the challenges 
of sociology is that you normally can’t experi-
ment on society — put one group of people 
in one situation and another group in another 
situation — and see what happens. You have to 
observe whatever situations happen to occur, 
and do your best to figure out why and how 
things turned out the way they did.
Fortunately for sociologists studying stratifica-
tion, over the past century quite a few countries 
have created a natural experiment by organiz-
ing themselves along socialist lines inspired by 
Marx’s ideas. No country has ever become the 
kind of perfect communist society that Marx 
imagined, but many have tried to hew to Marx’s 
values by strictly limiting the amount of money 
any one person can earn while guaranteeing 
certain things — food, shelter, employment — 
to all. How has the experiment turned out?
In some respects, it’s turned out pretty well. 
Communist China is a world superpower, 
and many countries — for example, the 
Scandinavian nations — have had great suc-
cess levying high taxes and guaranteeing many 
benefits, thus limiting social inequality even 
though they remain essentially capitalist.
In other respects, the experiment hasn’t turned 
out that well. The Soviet Union fell, and its con-
stituent republics have largely become capital-
ist democratic countries rather than remaining 
communist. Sociologist Gerhard Lenski, after 
close study, has come to believe that the fail-
ure of many socialist societies shows a funda-
mental flaw in Marx’s theory. “Freed from the 
fear of unemployment and lacking adequate 
material incentives,” writes Lenski, workers 
didn’t willingly pitch in as Marx thought they 
would. “Worker performance deteriorated and 
production stagnated or declined in Marxist 
societies everywhere.” In other words, maybe 
people do need some financial incentive such 
as the threat of losing their jobs to do everything 
that needs to be done in a society.

145
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
necessarily do much to reward effort rather than dumb luck: the biggest 
financial disparities are not disparities of income but rather disparities of 
wealth (that is, money in the bank), which is largely inherited and has noth-
ing to do with how hard you’re working at your job. There are also vast 
inequalities by ascribed attributes (see the section “Understanding social 
inequality” for a definition of ascribed attributes) — it doesn’t make any 
sense to reward someone simply for having been born a white male.
Today, most sociologists believe that at least some inequality is inevitable — 
whether or not it’s “necessary” — but that a lot of the inequality in society is 
excessive, hurtful, and unproductive.
The Many Means of Inequality
When some people end up near the top of the social ladder and others end 
up near the bottom, there are many reasons for the disparity. The first thing 
that comes to mind when you think of social inequality is probably inequality 
based on money; absolutely, that form of inequality is very real and very con-
sequential. However, there are many other reasons that some people end up 
privileged over others in any given society.
In this section, I’ll discuss several of the most important bases for social 
stratification — that is, several of the most important variables that can be 
different among people and can lead to social inequality. This, though, isn’t a 
complete list; any difference among people can result in social stratification.
Income and wealth
In societies that use money — that is, almost all currently existing societies — 
the distribution of money is one of the most important factors in social strati-
fication. The fact that it’s relatively easy to measure (the amount of money 
you have is a number that is usually beyond dispute) is another of the reasons 
it’s often used by social scientists. Income refers to the amount of money you 
earn at your job; wealth refers to the amount of money (and/or assets worth 
money, like a house or a car) you have in your possession.
In advanced capitalist societies, money is almost like magic: you can turn 
it into just about anything you want, from cars to houses to food to drugs 
to sex. Money can’t buy you love, but it can buy you attractive clothes and 
meals at nice restaurants. Crucially, it also buys security and freedom. The 
more money you have, the more freedom you have — it’s as simple as that.
Further, as I previously mentioned, with discipline and patience, money can 
be turned into more money. Savings can be invested for interest, or can be 

146
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
risked in ventures that may result in vast profits. If you don’t have savings, 
you’re bound to live paycheck to paycheck, trading your time for the highest 
wage you can negotiate.
Whether or not Marx was right that money and wealth constitute the funda-
mental basis of social inequality, he was absolutely right that people with 
more money can exercise direct power over people with less money. If I 
have a lot of money and you have very little, you may be forced to do just 
about anything I say if I’m willing to give you some of my money in return. 
Many people in capitalist societies find themselves with many job options to 
choose from, but people with no money and few specialized skills (see sec-
tion, “Specialized knowledge”) may have to consider themselves lucky to get 
any job. In the most dire cases, people may be forced into extremely risky 
and unpleasant actions that may include theft, drug dealing, or prostitution.
Yet even beyond this “magical” power to buy anything, money has a second 
important influence: people with lots of money are typically treated better — 
and thought better of — than people with just a little money, even in situations 
where money isn’t directly involved. Max Weber believed that one of the most 
important factors in the rise of capitalism was a religious belief that wealthy 
people were smiled upon by God; in capitalist societies today, most people 
believe that people with more wealth have worked harder and are more 
deserving than people with less wealth. This means that people with more 
money can exercise power and influence without having to spend a dime.
For all these reasons, money is at the heart of social stratification in almost 
all societies that exist today.
Occupation
If money is important, then jobs are important — if for no other reason than 
the fact that jobs produce income. But the job you do is an important basis of 
social stratification in and of itself.
It’s a little rude to start a conversation at a party by asking someone what 
they do — but people often do exactly that because knowing what someone 
does for a living tells you so much about them. It tells you about how much 
money they make, it tells you about how much education they have, and it’s 
a decent indication of what they are probably interested in and have knowl-
edge of.
The simplest way to measure “social class” (see section, “Understanding 
social inequality”) is to consider income or wealth, but another way many 
sociologists measure social class is by measures of occupational prestige. 

147
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
Sociologists have surveyed people in different countries to determine what 
occupations they find most prestigious; people in the occupations consid-
ered most prestigious may be considered at the top of the stratification 
order, and people in the least-prestigious occupations may be considered to 
be at the bottom.
What makes an occupation prestigious? It turns out to be a combination of 
factors. The amount of income a particular occupation yields is important, 
but so is the amount of education and training needed to work in that occu-
pation. Further, people tend to respect occupations seen as caring or doing 
good in the world. For this reason, a job as a teacher may be about as presti-
gious as an occupation in banking, even though the banker probably makes 
more money. Similarly, despite the multi-millions made by some professional 
athletes — and the adoration lavished on a few high-performing stars — the 
general occupation of “athlete” is about as prestigious as the occupation of 
“computer programmer.” The occupations considered most prestigious tend 
to be jobs that pay well, that require considerable education and skill, and 
that involve working in areas seen as important: Doctors, lawyers, corporate 
executives, and college professors all have highly prestigious occupations.
Besides yielding money and respect, your occupation also may equip you 
with important social connections and specialized knowledge that may come 
in handy down the line.
Innate ability
Without delving too deeply into psychology’s nature/nurture debate — the 
debate over whether your genetic makeup or your environment is more 
important in shaping who you become — it’s safe to say that some people 
are born with skills that can help them climb a society’s stratification ladder. 
Exactly what skills are useful may vary from society to society, but most soci-
eties have some way for people to turn inborn gifts into money, influence, 
and respect.
Some people may be born with a talent for doing math; others may have a 
talent for reading or using language. Athletic skills can be advantageous, and 
instinctive social skills can be tremendously useful. All of these skills, and 
more, probably have at least some genetic component — so it’s possible to 
be born equipped to succeed in some task important in your society. That 
doesn’t mean that you will succeed; you’ll need support, education, and 
opportunity to make the best use of your skills. Still, everyone has some 
inborn dispositions and talents, and it would be naïve to deny that those 
make a difference as you earn or are assigned (in most cases, it’s actually 
some of both) a place in your society’s stratification order.

148
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
 
It’s important to make clear, though, that there is no convincing evidence that 
innate ability co-varies with any other basis of social stratification — that is, a 
person who is relatively wealthy or well-connected or well-educated was not 
necessarily born with some special gift. All of those qualities derive from a 
number of different causes, so you shouldn’t assume that someone who is par-
ticularly successful or esteemed in society was somehow born with a genetic 
silver spoon in their mouth; or, conversely, that someone who has relatively 
little money or prestige was somehow born to fail.
Motivation
Motivation is a complex topic, and psychologists have spent careers trying to 
understand why people are motivated to do the things they do — and not to 
do the things they don’t do.
To some extent, the causes of any individual’s motivation are unknowable. 
Why is one kid motivated to do her homework whereas her brother is con-
tent to sit and watch TV? Why are some people go-getters at work, whereas 
others sit back and do only the minimum that’s required of them? Why do 
some people take initiative and start new projects whereas others prefer 
routine and predictability, disliking the risk or effort associated with being a 
pathbreaker? It’s hard to say.
In some ways, though, behavior that might be called “motivation” varies 
among people from different backgrounds, for predictable reasons. 
Sociologists who study childhood have found that parents who are relatively 
well-educated and well-off financially tend to teach their children from an 
early age that they should exercise initiative and express their opinions 
and desires, even if they’re contrary to what an authority figure — such 
as a schoolteacher or employer — seems to want. On the other hand, par-
ents who are less well-to-do tend to teach their children to be obedient and 
respectful, and not to rock the boat. (See Chapter 15 for more on childhood 
and the life course.)
Each attitude will serve children well in some situations and not in others; 
in that case, it’s not a question of how much motivation a person has but 
rather what kind of motivation. In any given social situation, a certain type 
of behavior is likely to earn a certain type of reward (or punishment). If 
it’s not clear what behavior is best, people can only guess at what will be 
rewarded, based on what they’ve been taught. If two different people have 
been taught differently about how to behave, they may behave differently in 
the same situation. You’ll only ask for a raise, for example, if you think the 
possibility of getting one outweighs the possible annoyance or embarrass-
ment of asking and not getting one. It may depend on how you think your 
boss expects you to behave, and that may depend on how your parents 
expected you to behave.

149
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
Connections
As I explain in detail in Chapter 7, social connections are a form of power 
in society. The better-placed you are to get information from and exercise 
influence on people in your society, the more power you have. As I note in 
that chapter, there are some powerful and prestigious occupations that rely 
almost entirely on people’s ability to bridge social gaps — but the right con-
nections are helpful in any social situation.
You may be a naturally social person who has a knack for making the right 
connections, but the number, nature, and strength of your social connections 
is also a function of how you stack up on the other variables listed in this sec-
tion. Consider:
 
✓ If you are wealthy, you can buy or will be offered admission to situations 
where you can meet other wealthy and influential people. If you have 
little money, it will be relatively difficult for you to meet people who 
have a lot of money.
I is for initiative . . . take some!
When I was in college, a member of the dorm 
staff made a sign reading i is for initiative…take 
some! and hung it on the wall by the elevator. 
My friends and I made fun of the sign because 
we thought it was highly unlikely that a goofy 
sign on the wall would motivate an under-
achieving student. That may be true, but it’s 
also true that the expectations and encourage-
ment (or lack thereof) we get from the people 
around us can play a very big role in determin-
ing what we achieve or don’t achieve in life.
William I. Thomas, a sociologist who was a 
member of the Chicago School, pointed out 
that a situation defined as real is real in its con-
sequences. For example, if it is believed that 
someone is incompetent, that person won’t 
even be given the chance to succeed. If people 
from a certain social background are believed 
not to be “college material,” they’ll be discour-
aged from applying to college and will have no 
opportunity to disprove what may be a very mis-
taken assumption about their academic ability. 
They won’t be placed in college-prep classes 
or challenged to join academic honor societies. 
Thus, a situation defined as real (they’re “not 
college material”) becomes real in its conse-
quences (without college-prep classes, they 
are in fact unprepared for college). This danger 
is one reason for the widespread institution of 
affirmative-action policies, which are designed 
to ensure that everyone is given a chance to 
succeed.
That said, it’s also true that often people do 
succeed despite being discouraged by all 
sides. When I was a teenager and told my dad 
that I was going to bicycle across the state of 
Minnesota, his skeptical response only made 
me more determined to do it. (I did it as part 
of a ride to raise money for multiple sclerosis 
research.) To say that the encouragement and 
expectations of influential others are important 
is not to say that any one person — or any mil-
lions of people — can determine the choices 
you will make in life.

150
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
 
✓ You may make a large number of social connections through your job; 
these will continue to be valuable to you even if you lose your job or 
switch jobs.
 
✓ You are likely to meet many people through your schooling, and being 
an alumnus of a certain institution may open doors with fellow alumni 
you haven’t even met. (The importance of classmate connections is 
demonstrated by the very fact that you’re reading this — it was through 
a friend from graduate school that I learned of the opportunity to write 
this book!)
The critical importance of social connections for an individual’s place in a 
stratification order has only been recognized relatively recently by sociolo-
gists, and it’s one of the reasons research into social networks has received 
so much attention over the last few decades. The importance of social con-
nections can be deeply frustrating when you’re on the losing end — for exam-
ple, when a job you want goes to someone who’s friends with the boss — but 
the fact of the matter is that social connections are an important part of the 
stratification system everywhere you go.
Credentials
A credential is certification by some known body that you have a skill, an 
experience, or another valued attribute. Credentials may be revoked, but 
they’re typically yours to keep when you’ve earned them. Examples of cre-
dentials include:
 
✓ A school degree
 
✓ An award
 
✓ Membership in an organization
 
✓ Employment for a company, whether past or present
Credentials are typically earned by the performance of some feat at some 
point in time, so they’re typically meaningful with respect to a person’s abili-
ties or experiences — but they can also be misleading or outdated. If you 
graduate from college and then proceed to spend the next thirty years lead-
ing a life of crime and corruption . . . well, you’re still a college graduate!
Given this fact, why do credentials matter so much? In large part, it’s because 
they’re relatively easy to communicate. A one-page résumé gives you a quick 
summary of a person’s credentials, and you can glance over it in just a few 
seconds; interviewing that person to learn more about their skills and experi-
ences would take much longer. Jobs typically aren’t granted on the strength 

151
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
of credentials alone, but an impressive credential may earn you an interview; 
on the other hand, a lack of impressive credentials may disqualify you before 
the interview process even begins.
Education
The process referred to as “education” is actually many things. Going to 
school means earning a diploma (a credential), making connections, and . . . 
oh yeah! . . . actually learning things. These are all reasons that people benefit 
from going to school.
On the other hand, education costs money. It’s generally a good investment — 
that’s why most countries force children to attend school and strongly encour-
age adults to attend college — but one of the reasons education is such a 
thorny political and social issue is that it’s far from clear exactly how much 
the education system should try to accomplish, and by extension how much it 
should cost. College can cost tens of thousands of dollars each year, but that 
cost likely includes room and board, access to world-class researchers, and 
amenities ranging from workout facilities to mental health counseling to 
private security. This is all part of a college “education” — but should it be? 
There are similar debates over education at every level.
 
In most societies education is one of the most important determinants of who 
gets ahead. but it’s important to remember that being “educated” means many 
different things, not all of which have to happen at a school. My father, for 
example, doesn’t have the credential of a college degree, but after decades of 
work he has certainly earned an “education” through on-the-job training. “I 
have a Ph.D.,” he likes to say, “in O.J.T.!”
Specialized knowledge
“Knowledge is power,” wrote the philosopher Francis Bacon. You’ve prob-
ably heard that from your parents, teachers, and educational programs on 
TV; it’s certainly true, but to paraphrase George Orwell, a sociologist might 
prefer to say, “All knowledge is power, but some knowledge is more powerful 
than other knowledge.”
What’s the difference? The most powerful knowledge in society is knowl-
edge about topics that are regarded as useful or important. Knowledge that 
may be very powerful in one society may be virtually useless in another. 
Sociologists distinguish between two kinds of specialized knowledge that 
may give a person a leg up in a stratification system, and refer to them both 
as “capital” — because like financial capital, they’re valuable assets.

152
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Human capital
The term human capital refers to useful skills that a person has learned. 
Examples of skills and knowledge that might count as human capital include:
 
✓ Knowledge about how to use a computer program.
 
✓ The ability to fix a car.
 
✓ Knowledge of medical treatments.
 
✓ Understanding of a country, state, or city’s legal system.
 
✓ Knowledge of sociology.
These are skills that might be learned through schooling, through job experi-
ence, or through self-education. All of these skills are potentially valuable on 
the job market, and in some cases can allow you to perform services for your-
self and your family that you’d otherwise need to pay for.
Cultural capital
The term cultural capital was coined by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (see 
Chapter 5). It refers to the knowledge of, and a liking for, high-status culture. 
What counts as “high-status culture” varies from one society to the next, but 
Bourdieu emphasized that the most consequential forms of cultural capital 
involve specialized knowledge that is you’re not likely to be convincingly con-
versant in unless you were raised in an environment where that knowledge 
was taught and valued.
Examples of what Bourdieu considered cultural capital include:
 
✓ Knowledge of classical music; being able to identify compositions with 
their composers.
 
✓ An interest in art that may look ugly to most people (for example, a pho-
tograph of a car wreck) but is considered fine art by museum curators 
and their wealthy patrons.
 
✓ Knowledge of fine wine and gourmet food.
None of this knowledge has much practical value — if your car breaks down, 
knowing who wrote the Eroica symphony is not going to help you fix it — but 
it’s all evidence that you were likely raised by relatively wealthy, well-educated 
parents. Bourdieu pointed out that if you have this knowledge, other privileged 
people are likely to see you as one of their own and are likely to treat you 
with special favor.

 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
Race/sex/caste discrimination
Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or caste is a prime example of 
ascribed stratification, (mentioned earlier in this chapter): stratification that 
depends on a characteristic that you were born with and is virtually impos-
sible to change.
In this context, race refers to the aspects of your physical appearance that 
identify you with a particular group recognized by your society; sex refers 
to whether you’re a man or a woman; and caste refers to your social status 
in societies where your family of birth is permanently associated with one 
status or another.
This is a central topic in sociology, and it has its own chapter — Chapter 9 — 
in this book. Much more on this topic appears in that chapter, but it appears 
here as well because it’s simply impossible to talk about social stratifica-
tion without considering this kind of discrimination. In societies around the 
world, throughout history, people’s sex and the color of their skin have been 
social statuses that have had vastly determinative effects. At worst, race and 
gender have been the bases for explicit or implicit slavery, depriving millions 
of people of freedoms enjoyed by others.
Today, explicit slavery (that is, slavery openly identified as such) is virtu-
ally extinct, and discrimination by race and gender is happily on the wane 
in most societies. That said, racism and sexism are extremely stubborn 
forms of discrimination, and no one should pretend that there’s a place on 
earth where race and sex don’t matter in determining people’s life chances. 
Another means of ascribed stratification, and one being hotly debated 
around the world today, is sexual orientation — whether a person is sexually 
attracted to members of the opposite sex, the same sex, or both. All of these 
characteristics (race, sex, sexual orientation, and caste) continue to be very 
important parts of societies’ stratification orders. 
Age discrimination
Age discrimination is another means of ascribed stratification — but unlike 
race, sex, or caste, age does obviously change over a person’s lifetime. Your 
actual or perceived age has real consequences for how people perceive you 
and what opportunities you may or may not be given in society.
The role of age in social stratification can be difficult to sort out because 
unlike race or caste, age does correspond to real differences in a person’s 
experience and abilities. People are obviously too immature to do most 
paying jobs until they’ve grown out of childhood, and as they progress 

154
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
through adulthood and into old age, people gain skills and experience but 
eventually lose physical and, possibly, mental endurance and agility. So when 
assessing a person’s fitness for a job, age is not irrelevant in the same way 
race and sex normally are. (I say “normally” because although race and sex 
do not correspond to differences in ability, they may be relevant characteris-
tics for certain specialized jobs.)
That said, age can also be the basis for unfair discrimination — people may 
be treated poorly because they’re seen as being “too young” or “too old,” or 
may be esteemed just for being a certain age. This has become an increasing 
issue in contemporary society as people’s work lives have become longer and 
jobs have become less stable: A person who is middle-aged or older may find 
themselves losing a job to a younger person who is no better qualified. Further, 
this treatment may vary with other ascribed characteristics: Women may face 
harsher age discrimination than men for some jobs, and vice-versa for others.
Comparing inequality internationally
If different societies vary in the ways that their members are stratified, it only 
makes sense that some societies would actually be more equal than others — 
that inequality would be more severe in some societies than in others. In fact, 
this is the case, and sociologists have learned some important facts about how 
different societies are stratified, and how stratification has changed over time.
It’s not just the degree of inequality that varies among societies, though. 
David B. Grusky, a leading expert on inequality, notes that social stratifica-
tion systems vary along a number of dimensions, including:
 
✓ Type of assets. What is the main attribute that people high in the strati-
fication order have more of than others? In some cases it’s money, in 
others it’s human capital, in others it’s political power or cultural prestige.
 
✓ Classes. What are the major classes in society? In “classic” capitalist 
society, it’s the bourgeois and the proletariat as Marx said; in other soci-
eties, it’s slaves and slave-owners or nobles and commoners.
 
✓ Degree of inequality. How much inequality is there between the people 
in the highest classes and those in the lowest classes? In medieval feudal 
society, inequality was very high; in prehistoric tribal society, inequality 
was relatively low. In our advanced industrial society, says Grusky, the 
degree of inequality is in between those two extremes.
 
✓ Rigidity. How much social mobility does a society allow? A traditional 
caste society, where people are born into inflexible social classes, allows 
virtually no mobility; hard as it sometimes seems to “get ahead” in 
modern capitalism, it does happen. (So, to the dismay of many overam-
bitious financiers, does “going broke.”)

155
 Chapter 8: Social Stratification: We’re All Equal, But . . .
Thinking about stratification this way makes clear that even if modern indus-
trial capitalism is no bed of roses — especially for people on the bottom of 
the social hierarchy — it’s far more open than most societies, for most of 
human history, have been. 
Furthermore, almost all societies around the world are increasingly similar in 
the way their stratification systems are organized. Globalization and interna-
tional development has made the industrial capitalist model near-universal 
around the world; few countries today are dominated by the kind of rigid 
stratification systems that were previously common. Advanced industrial 
countries like those in Europe and North America have seen the emergence 
of a large, basically happy middle class. (See Chapter 16 for more on social 
change.) 
Members of the middle class aren’t particularly wealthy, but they have 
enough income to comfortably provide for their families and buy a few luxu-
ries to boot. Their jobs may be wearying, but their fingers aren’t worked to 
the bone, and they likely even have some managerial responsibilities and 
freedoms. Compared to the lives of most people at most times in history, 
middle-class life is good.
Some sociologists, though — especially those who tend to agree with Marx that 
capitalism leads to exploitation — have observed that the prosperity of the 
developed world is built on the back of the developing world. The luxuries 
that middle-class Americans, Europeans, and Japanese enjoy are so affordable 
because they’re built by workers in China, Mexico, and other developing coun-
tries who earn a small fraction of what their counterparts in the developed 
world earn. A factory worker in Michigan can afford a lifestyle that’s absolutely 
prince-like compared to what a factory worker in rural China can afford. This 
disparity in living standards has fueled two developments:
 
✓ Waves of immigration into the developed world from the developing 
world, as workers move in search of better wages and, often, greater 
personal freedom. The difference in earning power, even for undocu-
mented immigrants without the legal right to work, can be so much 
greater that men and women will leave their families for months or years 
at a time so they can send a portion of their earnings back home. (See 
Chapter 9 for more on immigration.)
 
✓ Outsourcing of industrial production and, increasingly, skilled labor 
to the developing world. Things can be built and done so much more 
cheaply in the developing world that it’s all but irresistible for com-
panies interested in making a profit (and what company isn’t?) to hire 
workers in the developing world to do any work they’re capable of 
doing. Because more and more work is able to be done in the develop-
ing world, more and more work is being outsourced — despite the fact 
that it’s led to the loss of millions of jobs in the countries doing the 
outsourcing.

156
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Some sociologists, collectively called “world-system theorists” — a term 
inspired by the work of the sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein — believe that 
the bourgeois have only managed to stave off worldwide revolution by out-
sourcing the worst, most exploitative jobs. They believe that eventually, the 
worldwide proletariat will get wise to this system and will prove Marx right 
by revolting and changing the rules of the game.
Will that happen? It’s impossible to say for sure. The rules of the stratifica-
tion game have changed many times before, and it’s only reasonable to think 
that — one way or another — they’re likely to change again.

ace and sex: everyone’s got ’em. They’re not “supposed” to matter any 
more, but of course they still do. People in societies around the world 
still pay close attention to the color of your skin and to whether you’re a man 
or a woman. What they make of that information varies from place to place — 
and has of course varied dramatically through history — but there’s no get-
ting around the fact that race and sex still matter, and they’re going to keep 
on mattering for the rest of your life and the rest of mine.
Along with social stratification (see Chapter 8), this is one of the core areas 
of sociology. Sociologists also study all the other subjects in this book — 
religion, education, politics, business, and the economy — but if you’re a 
journalist or a policymaker, sociologists are most likely to be filed in your 
Rolodex of experts under the subject race and sex discrimination.
In this chapter, I start by explaining the general idea of bias and discrimina-
tion as they are studied by sociologists. I then explain what sociologists have 
learned about race specifically, and then what sociologists have learned about 
sex. (Along the way, I’ll explain what the differences are between “race” and 
“ethnicity,” and between “sex” and “gender.”) Finally, I explain why even in the 
post-feminist, post-Civil-Rights era, race and sex still matter — very much so.

158
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Bias and Discrimination: 
A Two-Sided Coin
You’re special. You’re unique. You know this because your mom probably 
told you so, and umpteen children’s TV shows certainly told you so. It’s abso-
lutely true — there’s no one exactly like you. There are, however, millions 
or billions of other people who are the same race as you are, and even more 
people who are the same sex that you are. When someone uses race, sex, or 
any other of your personal attributes to make assumptions about your other 
characteristics, that is bias. When those assumptions affect the decisions 
they make regarding you, that is discrimination.
First off, let me get one thing out of the way: You are biased regarding other 
people, and you practice social discrimination every day. So do I. Maybe 
you’d like to believe that’s not the case, but accepting the universality of bias 
and discrimination is the first step towards understanding them — and figur-
ing out how to minimize their most harmful effects.
Do you think I’m wrong about you? Aren’t you biased? Don’t you discrimi-
nate? Okay, maybe you don’t . . . but have you ever done any of these things?
Guessed that someone with a certain skin color, in a certain neighbor-
hood, is “not from around here”?
Guessed that a young child is a boy because he’s wearing blue, or a girl 
because she’s wearing pink?
Taken account of race or sex in assessing someone’s job performance — 
whether or not they work for you?
Whether or not it’s morally right, empirically it’s not unreasonable to con-
sider race or sex in these ways. If you’re an English-speaker in Shanghai 
looking for directions and you see only one person on a crowded street who 
doesn’t have Asian features, it makes sense to pick that person to ask direc-
tions. It doesn’t necessarily make you a backward-thinking traditionalist 
to dress your baby daughter in pink or your young son in a gender-neutral 
color rather than in blue overalls and a baseball cap. The millions of African-
Americans who were especially supportive of the presidential campaign of 
Barack Obama because he’s black probably don’t think of themselves as 
having been inappropriately “racist.”
Race and sex are examples of ascribed statuses: statuses that are assigned 
to us because of factors beyond our control. You had no control over the 
color of skin and the sex you were born with, and yet people routinely judge 
you on the basis of those characteristics. It’s not fair, but it happens. The 
previous examples show that the subject gets complicated when identities 
become involved — when people take ownership of those characteristics. 

159
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
In those cases, these ascribed statuses become points of pride. In that case, 
is it still best to ignore those statuses? You of course have your own opinion 
on the matter, but most people would say not.
The subjects of race and sex are very complicated, and it does no one a favor 
to simplify them. On the one hand, racism and sexism have fueled some of 
the most horrible episodes in the history of the human race:
 
✓ The slavery of millions, from ancient Rome to the present day
 
✓ The Holocaust and other episodes of genocide
 
✓ The widespread — in some eras, nearly universal — refusal to allow 
women the right to vote, the right to own property, or even the right to 
choose where, when, and with whom they will share their bodies
 
✓ People being institutionalized, imprisoned, or even killed for consensual 
intimacy with a person of the same sex
This awful history has given rise, in recent decades, to the widespread pas-
sage of laws that prohibit depriving anyone of equal rights because of the 
color of their skin or whether they are a man or a woman. These laws are far 
from universal, and far from universally effective in areas where they exist, 
but they’ve gone a long way towards eliminating the most heinous abuses 
and inequities.
Somewhat paradoxically, though — yes, you can add this to the long list 
of social paradoxes — it’s precisely this history that has led to pride and 
solidarity among members of racial and ethnic groups, among women and 
among men, among lesbians, gays, and the transgendered. Most people 
are proud of their race and proud of their ethnicity, and many are proud of 
their sex and their sexual orientation. They want you to know that they’re 
Mexican, or Lithuanian, or American Indian, or African-European. Thousands 
parade down city streets in celebration of women’s rights or queer pride. 
None of these people would want it denied that they are who they are — but 
they don’t want that to limit their freedom to make choices about what to do 
with their lives.
Making things more complicated is the fact that members of each of these 
groups disagree — sometimes violently — about what being a member of 
a particular race or sex means. There are as many different ways of being 
Asian-American as there are Asian-Americans, as many different ways of 
being female as there are women, and as many ways of being straight or gay 
as there are people in the world. There may be leaders within these com-
munities, but it’s not for any one person to determine what it is to be Asian-
American or female or gay.
This is the complex landscape of the social world today: a world where race 
and sex matter, but where they matter in different ways for different people 
at different times.

160
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Race and Ethnicity
In this section, I describe the sociological study of race and ethnicity, a sub-
ject at the heart of just about everything sociologists care about: equality 
(and inequality), identity (and lack thereof), social change, and (for better 
and for worse), social stability.
You can choose your ethnicity, 
but you can’t choose your race
In sociological terms, race refers to an ascribed status: something deter-
mined by others based on the physical characteristics you were born with. 
Ethnicity, on the other hand, generally refers to an achieved status: a status 
you choose for yourself by the identity you assume, the groups you associate 
yourself with, and the behaviors you practice.
Race
Every society has its own set of racial groups that its members understand 
and react to. In some societies, there are dramatic differences in physical 
features: Some people, for example, have very light skin whereas others have 
very dark skin. In other societies, the differences may not be so dramatic to 
an outsider but are easy to recognize for those who are raised in those soci-
eties: Relatively subtle differences in skin shades or facial features can lead 
to just as much bias and discrimination as differences that are objectively 
much more marked.
In fact, the exact same physical appearance can mean different things in dif-
ferent societies. As an example of this, consider what it means to be “black.” 
That’s a widely-understood racial category in the United States, the West 
Indies, and many other areas; it’s associated with having particularly dark-
pigmented skin, and in both the United States and the Dominican Republic 
has been (in fact, often still is) associated with negative discrimination. 
In the United States, though, “black” people have historically been people of 
African descent, their families often brought unwillingly to America as slaves. 
Many Americans assume that an individual with dark skin is of this heritage. 
If they discover that a “black” person is actually an immigrant from the West 
Indies, Americans often treat that person differently.
Sociologist Mary Waters has described the frustrations of dark-skinned 
American immigrants from the West Indies, who can find themselves excluded 
by both non-black Americans — who regard the newcomers as “black” and dis-
criminate against them on that basis — and by African-Americans, who regard 

161
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
the immigrants as outsiders who are — despite the color of their skin — not 
“really” black. Some of these immigrants, in some contexts, consciously adopt 
the dress and speaking styles of African-Americans to fit in with that group; 
others, in other situations, emphasize their West Indian heritage through their 
accent and their dress to avoid the discrimination faced by African-Americans.
This example shows the complexities of race, and the frustration that can be 
experienced by both racial minorities and members of a racial majority as 
they try to gain acceptance and avoid discrimination.
Ethnicity
I explained at the beginning of this section that sociologists use the term 
“ethnicity” to describe a status that a person chooses for himself or her-
self, an identification with a group of people. In common usage, the term 
“ethnicity” is often used to refer to a national or cultural heritage that isn’t 
necessarily associated with distinctive physical features. It’s worth remem-
bering, though, that in the English language some social categories that are 
today called ethnicities — for example, Italian or German or Russian — were 
often called “races” 100 years ago, when they were generally seen as being 
more fundamental and were more often used as the basis of discrimination. 
(American newspapers from the turn of the 20th century are full of deroga-
tory references to, for example, “the Irish race.”) 
Even if the terms “race” and “ethnicity” are sometimes used interchange-
ably by non-sociologists, in sociological terms they refer to very different 
types of social groups. As I noted earlier in this chapter, your race is some-
thing others decide for you, whether you like it or not. It mainly describes 
your physical features. Your ethnicity, on the other hand, refers to the cul-
tural group with which you consciously identify. A person’s ethnicity often 
includes the following features:
 
✓ A historical narrative, generally associated with a place of origin. When 
I say that my ethnicity is “German-American,” that means that I identify 
with a group of people who lived in one area in Europe for many genera-
tions, then crossed the Atlantic to the United States.
 
✓ Cultural customs, such as food, holiday celebrations, a language. My 
grandmother grew up in New Ulm, Minnesota, speaking German, eating 
German food, and celebrating German-Catholic holidays. I’ve never 
learned German, but I’ve eaten more than my share of sauerkraut and 
dumplings.
 
✓ Symbols and distinctive styles of dress. Ethnicities are often associated 
with flags and colors, and especially at times of celebration, unmistak-
able outfits. (No, I’ve never worn lederhosen — but if you saw me in a 
pair, you’d certainly know what my ethnicity is!)

162
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Although ethnicities are often associated with races, they are by definition 
more free-floating — spouses often adopt one another’s ethnic practices, and 
people may embrace ethnicities that have nothing to do with their parent-
age or biological characteristics, becoming indistinguishable from someone 
who grew up in a particular ethnic culture. In cases where ethnicities are not 
closely associated with a set of obvious physical characteristics, or where 
a certain physical appearance might plausibly be associated with any of a 
number of ethnicities, ethnicity may become almost entirely elective.
Mary Waters — the same sociologist mentioned earlier for her study of West 
Indian immigrants — wrote a book about European-Americans called Ethnic 
Options. The title refers to the fact that although African-Americans or Asian-
Americans or Hispanic-Americans are typically obviously identifiable as such, 
Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, or Norwegian-Americans are not. Their 
ethnicity is something they can choose to play up with flags and anthems, or 
completely ignore if that’s what they prefer.
Ethnicity is so flexible, in fact, that in the modern world, people might choose 
to identify with groups and traditions that you wouldn’t necessarily think of 
as “ethnic” but are used that way. Think of alumni of certain universities who 
wear their college shirts and proudly declare their membership in that col-
lege community, or people who grew up in a certain state or city or neighbor-
hood and take that fact as an essential aspect of their identity. In this way, 
being “a Domer” (an alumnus of the University of Notre Dame, which has a 
building with a golden dome), a Californian, or a New Yorker can be a per-
son’s primary “ethnicity.” 
Racial discrimination: Conscious 
and unconscious
Race remains relevant around the world for many reasons, but first and 
foremost because in virtually every society, the color of your skin and other 
physical features — the color of your eyes, whether your hair is curly, you 
name it — are likely to affect the way people perceive you and the way they 
treat you.
Obviously this is illogical in the sense that a person’s physical features tell 
you nothing about their abilities, personality, or background. People know 
better than to judge the quality of a car’s engine by the color it’s painted, and 
similarly they should know better than to judge a person’s mind or heart by 
the color of their skin. And yet, they do — and they do, and they do, and they 
do, again and again and again.
It isn’t right, and in most countries today discrimination by race is illegal . . . 
but it happens, consciously and unconsciously. In this section, I explain these 
two types of racial discrimination.

163
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
Conscious
Through the course of human history, many — in fact, probably most — 
people have consciously discriminated by race. That is, they have deliberately 
chosen to treat people differently based on skin color or other attributes. This 
has been so widespread that the unfortunate tendency to interpret physical 
appearance as being a significant predictor of a person’s abilities and personal-
ity seems to be a basic feature of human nature. Look at kids in a schoolyard: 
Whether they’re in a big multicultural city or a homogeneous rural community, 
they always find something about each other’s appearance to pay attention to, 
and in many cases make fun of or ostracize each other based on appearance. 
It’s not pretty, but there it is — there’s no mystery about why racism started in 
the first place.
Over time, ideas about race become institutionalized and formalized: they’re 
written down and sometimes passed into law. Today, biological anthropolo-
gists understand that there’s really no such thing as “race” in the sense of 
Caste in stone?
“Caste” is not a concept that most people today 
are very familiar with, but it’s something that 
has virtually defined the lives of many millions of 
people throughout history. A caste is an inher-
ited class status, one you’re born into if you live 
in a society that subscribes to the idea of caste. 
Other ascribed class statuses — including race 
and sex — are also inherited, but in societies 
with caste systems, caste transcends race and 
sex, and is associated with cultural practices 
as an ethnicity might be.
Societies around the world have had castes of 
one sort or another. Many societies have had 
priestly castes, where people seen as espe-
cially holy or having important spiritual roles 
descend from one another. An inherited mon-
archy or aristocracy is another form of caste, 
with ruling power being passed on from moth-
ers and fathers to sons and daughters. Some 
societies — for example, traditional societies 
in India — are divided up into many inherited 
castes, sometimes including an “untouchable” 
caste at the bottom of the social ladder.
Castes share some features of races and eth-
nicities: Biological inheritance is central to 
caste membership, as it is to membership in all 
racial groups and many ethnic groups. Castes 
are different, though, in that they’re explicitly 
tied to a society’s power structure. Because a 
caste system means that power (or lack thereof) 
is inherited rather than earned, most people 
today see strict caste systems as unfair and 
undesirable. Around the world, caste systems 
have been challenged and have lost a great 
deal of their influence — the queen of England, 
for example, still nominally has power over all of 
Great Britain, but as a practical matter the posi-
tion is largely symbolic. (You wouldn’t normally 
hear the term “caste” used to describe the 
British aristocracy, but in a sociological sense 
it is indeed a caste: Like any other caste status, 
royalty is a class position one is born into and 
cannot lose.)
Still, caste systems are far from gone or forgot-
ten: Hundreds of millions of people in the world 
today have faced discrimination based on the 
caste that they were born into.

164
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
an objective set of biological categories into which humans might be placed 
(yes, there are differences in skin color and other features, but they fall along 
a continuum and have no relevance for people’s intellect or abilities). For 
centuries, though, it was widely believed — and documented in highly ques-
tionable texts — that there were fundamental differences among the “races of 
man,” and that those differences made it only logical to treat different races 
differently. At worst, these completely mistaken ideas justified slavery and 
genocide.
Without excusing the millions of people who have actively participated in 
outright and unapologetic racial discrimination around the world, it’s worth 
pointing out that the example of racism illustrates the power of society to 
influence people’s beliefs and actions. When you grow up in a society where 
racial discrimination is completely embedded in the social fabric, it can be 
very difficult to see beyond what you’re taught from early childhood and 
what is taken for granted by everyone around you. And, of course, if you’re 
a member of a group that benefits from racial discrimination, it can be very 
convenient not to question this received wisdom.
Unconscious
If all racial discrimination was conscious, it wouldn’t be nearly as much of a 
problem today as it continues to be. In societies where racism has been sci-
entifically debunked and socially deplored, it should end . . . right? Well, yes, 
it should . . . but it doesn’t.
For one thing, there are people who continue, despite all evidence, to con-
sciously believe that there are fundamental differences among races — and 
they’re not just the few extremists who praise Hitler and burn crosses. When 
I was growing up as a middle-class kid in St. Paul, Minnesota, I knew people 
who genuinely believed (though they would say so only privately) that inter-
racial love affairs were improper.
Beyond that, though, unconscious racism continues to be widespread. This is 
when someone takes another person’s race into consideration without even 
knowing it. This continues to happen for at least three different reasons: the 
weight of history, the self-fulfilling prophecy, and basic human nature.
The weight of history
Even someone born in the 21st century in one of the world’s most progres-
sive societies is going to come across a huge amount of explicitly or implic-
itly racist material. The world’s history of racism is too vast to be completely 
wiped out — and in fact most people would say that the past must be remem-
bered to avoid repeating it.
Books, movies, art, and stories that propagate racist stereotypes are still 
widely available, and no one can completely escape the influence of this 
material. In some cases, these influences and others may lead people to act 
or think in a racist manner without even realizing it.

165
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
The self-fulfilling prophecy
In Chapter 8, I cite the sociologist W.I. Thomas, who said that a situation 
defined as real is real in its consequences. When a group of people face 
systematic discrimination based on their physical appearance, the hurtful 
effects of that discrimination add up over time and can’t be easily erased.
In the United States, for example, African-Americans were initially enslaved and 
then subjected to many decades of explicitly discriminatory practices and poli-
cies. That meant lost opportunities for education and employment experience, 
and today black Americans are still catching up to white Americans in these 
areas. There is a persistent gap between the average academic achievement of 
African-Americans and white Americans, and blacks — especially black men — 
are incarcerated at a significantly higher rate than are white Americans.
The fact that these actual disparities say nothing about differences of abil-
ity does not stop many white Americans from unconsciously discriminating 
against blacks, every day across the country. This is one reason for the wide-
spread adoption of pro-diversity policies: Undoing centuries of conscious 
discrimination may require an equally conscious effort.
 
The unpleasant truth is that people seem to need no excuse to treat one 
another differently based on appearance. This doesn’t make it okay, but it 
does mean that fighting racism is probably going to require constant vigilance 
as long as people are people.
The myth of the “model minority”
One of sociologists’ most important contributions to the understanding of 
race and racism has been to debunk the myth of the “model minority.”
The “model minority” is an idea that’s been used to underplay or dismiss the 
continuing significance of racism. The proponents of this idea point to the 
fact that some racial minority groups have been exceptionally successful at 
quickly achieving equality — or better than equality — with a majority group 
in terms of education and career success. The example most often mentioned 
is Asian-Americans, a racial minority in the United States who, despite the 
fact that many families initially arrived as immigrants with few resources, are 
now on average as comfortably situated financially as are white Americans — 
and are, on average, now better educated.
Some observers have looked at the achievements of Asian-Americans and 
called them a “model minority,” a group that proves racism isn’t really a 
deterrent for people who are willing to work hard and try to get ahead. If 
Asian-Americans did it, they say, so can African-Americans and Hispanic-
Americans.

166
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Sociologists, though, have pointed out that there are vast differences among 
minority groups, and though there are some patterns and similarities in 
minority groups’ experiences, in no way is it accurate to say that one group 
can be a “model” for another. As much credit as Asian-Americans deserve 
for their success in the United States, it’s wrong to say that they can serve as 
“models” for other minority groups in the sense that a “model student” can 
inspire other students to study harder. Here are a few specific reasons the 
“model minority” concept is misguided:
 
✓ Not all racism is the same. It is absolutely true that Asian-Americans 
have faced, and continue to face, racism and discrimination. Immigrants 
from East Asia have had to fight hateful stereotypes and have been 
denied jobs, housing, and schooling on the basis of their physical 
appearance. It does Asian-Americans no discredit, though, to say that 
not all racism is the same, and that other racial groups may have faced 
and may continue to face discrimination that is even more hurtful, based 
on different sets of (equally misguided) ideas about differences in ability 
or intellect.
 
✓ Different groups come from different circumstances. Although all 
immigrants face challenges acclimating to a new country (see next sec-
tion), people don’t arrive as blank slates. Compared to, say, African-
Americans, Asian-Americans are on average relatively recent and 
relatively well-educated arrivals to the United States. Further, upon 
arrival they were often able to live in communities of similar immigrants 
who were able to support each other. Not all immigrant groups have had 
these advantages.
 
✓ Any “minority group” is actually many minority groups. Asian-
Americans come from many different countries, and came for many 
different reasons; this is true of any racial or ethnic minority group. It’s 
difficult, and is often misleading, to make any general statement about 
“Asian-Americans” as a group. Hmong-Americans, for example, are by 
and large recent arrivals who fled their homelands in the wake of vio-
lent conflicts. They’ve faced tremendous challenges immigrating to the 
United States, including some discrimination from all racial groups, 
fellow Asian-Americans included. To sweep Hmong-Americans under the 
“model minority” rug and deny that their circumstances are exceptional 
and might require exceptional support would be to do them a serious 
injustice.
The achievements of Asian-Americans and members of other groups that 
might be characterized as “model minorities” are very real and very hard-
earned, but it’s simply not the case that they’ve figured out some secret trick 
that other racial minority groups just need to learn in order to overcome the 
harmful effects of racism.

 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
Immigration and “assimilation” (or not)
Not all ethnic groups are immigrant groups — most societies have a number 
of indigenous ethnic groups as well as ethnic groups that have come from 
elsewhere, plus there are ethnic groups not associated with a place of origin. 
Still, almost all sociologists interested in race and ethnicity find themselves 
looking closely at the experiences of immigrants.
The members of the Chicago School were among the first sociologists to 
really look closely at immigration. The turn of the 20th century saw a wave 
of immigration to the United States that transformed America’s social land-
scape, and that transformation was most visible in big cities like Chicago, 
where the new arrivals went looking for work.
Initially, sociologists thought immigration could be understood in terms of 
“assimilation.” The word assimilation means to be absorbed into, to become 
one of. America was seen as a great “melting pot” where people from all dif-
ferent places arrived to be incorporated into one big whole.
The theory of assimilation has it that people arrive speaking their native 
languages, wearing their native styles of dress, and otherwise practicing the 
traditions of their home countries; over time, they are “assimilated” into their 
new community, adopting that country’s language and traditions. If that’s the 
way it works, the study of immigration is just the study of why some groups 
assimilate more quickly and peacefully than others.
As sociologists have spent more time studying immigration, though, they’ve 
come to understand that it’s just not that simple. It’s certainly true that all 
immigrants choose to, or are forced to, adapt to the ways of their new homes 
to at least some extent — but it’s not a linear path where they go from being 
0 percent assimilated to 100 percent assimilated. Sociologists of immigration 
today appreciate that there are at least three things wrong with the basic 
“assimilation” theory:
 
✓ Assimilate to what? If immigrants are assimilating to something, to 
what, exactly, are they assimilating? The United States and other coun-
tries do have mainstream cultures (see Chapter 5) containing some 
quintessential features, but modern societies are so diverse that it’s 
impossible to even describe what a fully “assimilated” person would 
look like. You’ve heard the phrase “as American as apple pie,” but does 
that mean that if I don’t like apple pie, I’m not completely assimilated to 
American culture?
 
✓ “Assimilation” means many things. Imagine three immigrants to the 
United States from China. One learns to love hot dogs and Elvis Presley 
but never learns a word of English. Another learns perfect English but 

168
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
continues to dress and eat as she did in China. Another makes several 
Mexican-American friends and learns fluent Spanish. Which of these 
three is most “assimilated”? This example shows how absurd the ques-
tion is. Joining a new society can mean a number of different things, and 
they don’t necessarily all go together.
 
✓ Why assimilate? Immigrants vary widely in how much they want to trade 
their native cultures for the lifestyle of the country they move to. Some 
immigrants enthusiastically do anything they can to adopt the ways of 
their new country, but others prefer to keep doing things as much as 
possible the way they always have. There are many factors — including 
age, location, and reason for immigrating — that go into these choices, 
and sociologists have learned not to assume that it’s in any given indi-
vidual’s interest to “assimilate” to a new way of life. Many immigrants live 
in ethnic enclaves where they are able to continue speaking their native 
language and associating with fellow immigrants from their country, and 
they are perfectly and justifiably happy with that choice.
Does speaking Spanish mean you’re a Latino?
It’s easy to rattle off a list of ethnic and racial 
groups, and one of them is likely to be “Latino” 
or “Hispanic.” You have a general idea of what 
a “Latino” is — they probably are descended 
from Spanish-speaking people, and may have 
the skin colors or facial features associated 
with residents of Mexico or Central America — 
but you probably don’t know exactly what a 
Latino is, even if you are one yourself!
That’s because there’s no universal definition 
of who counts as a Latino. It’s a term of con-
venience used to describe people with either 
of the characteristics I mentioned, or who are 
descended from residents of Latin American 
countries. Like any term for an ethnicity or race, 
“Latino” includes a wide range of different 
people; even wider than most. A man living in 
Brazil, a woman in Alaska whose grandmother 
was born in Mexico, a Spaniard whose father 
came from the Dominican Republic . . . all of 
these might be considered “Latinos.”
Sociologist Wendy Roth studied Latinos in 
the United States, in the Dominican Republic, 
and in Puerto Rico, and found that many of the 
people she talked with didn’t identify them-
selves as “Latinos;” they considered them-
selves “Dominicans” or “Puerto Ricans.” And, 
if they immigrated to America, they found that 
they were often regarded as “black” or “white” 
simply because of the color of their skin. For all 
of these reasons, “Latino” would hardly seem 
to make any sense as a category.
And yet it does, and it’s become widely used 
and adopted — in part, says Roth, because of 
international television stations like Univision 
that promote the idea of a common identity 
among Spanish speakers. Binding together 
under one big “ethnicity” also helps Latinos 
gain visibility and political clout, even if it has 
little to do with how they actually see them-
selves. This example illustrates the complexity 
of race and ethnicity. You may “be” a certain 
race because people see you that way, and you 
may “be” a certain ethnicity because you iden-
tify with a group of people, but ethnicities and 
races are always in flux as people and societies 
change.

169
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
 
Every society is diverse, and to assume there’s one way to “properly” be a 
member of that society is not fair to either longtime residents or to new 
arrivals.
Sex and Gender
Just as “race” and “ethnicity” are often used interchangeably but mean differ-
ent things from a sociological standpoint, such is the case with the terms “sex” 
and “gender.” As used by sociologists, the word sex refers to a person’s biolog-
ical sex; with a few exceptions, this is unambiguously male or female. Gender 
is a more complicated term that refers, like “ethnicity,” to a role that a person 
identifies with; it may or may not correspond to a person’s biological sex.
In this section, I describe the history of sex and gender from a sociological 
standpoint and explain how sociologists are trying to keep up with the rapid 
recent social changes in how sex, gender, and sexual orientation are viewed.
“You’ve come a long way, baby”?: The 
women’s movement and its discontents
Women can have babies. Men can’t. After the babies are born, women can 
nurse them. Men can’t. The basic biological differences between men and 
women have always led to them having different roles in societies. As societ-
ies grew and institutionalized — that is, created social institutions such as 
businesses and governments, with elaborate codes of law — these differences 
became formalized in specific rules about what men and women could do.
This played out differently in each society, but in most societies around the 
world, it was made difficult or impossible for women to take formal leader-
ship roles. In many societies women were for a long time unable to own prop-
erty or vote.
As with racial discrimination, sex discrimination came under increasing chal-
lenge as the principle of equality that fueled the revolutions of the 18th and 
19th centuries (see Chapter 3) spread, and as science made increasingly clear 
that there were no significant differences between men and women in intellect 
or ability. An international suffrage movement around the turn of the 20th cen-
tury earned women the right to vote in most countries around the world, and 
other legal barriers to women’s equality began quickly to drop away.
But even as formal distinctions between men and women fell away, many 
informal distinctions remained. In the postwar “Baby Boom,” women were 
still typically expected to stay at home and care for the children and the 

170
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
home while their husbands went off to bring home the bacon. This theoreti-
cal ideal was never actually as widespread as it seemed (see Chapter 15), but 
many women felt suffocated by the expectation that they would inevitably 
find a life of domesticity more rewarding than any alternative.
A wave of influential thinkers — Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and others — 
called for a complete rethinking of the roles of women in society, and millions 
of women around the world actively resisted being pigeonholed in the role of 
passive nurturer. In part because of this cultural shift and in part because of 
an economic recession, women entered the workforce in record numbers, and 
today it’s normal for women in many, if not most, societies around the world 
to have independent careers in addition to, or instead of, raising children.
Today, many young women prefer not to identify themselves as “feminists.” 
The term is often associated with a strident political stance, and some 
women believe that the success of the women’s movement created chal-
lenges for women who freely choose, for example, to leave their jobs to raise 
children. Some feel that the new challenge for feminists is to advocate for 
woman-friendly and family-friendly laws and corporate policies that make it 
easier to take time off work for childbearing or family responsibilities.
Still, for all the success of the women’s movement, the fact of the matter is 
that women continue to face negative discrimination in almost every society. 
Women’s earnings are still not as high as those of men with comparable expe-
rience, and women are still underrepresented in executive suites.
There are several reasons for the continuing disparity in career achievement 
between men and women. A few of the most important include:
 
✓ Direct discrimination. In many cases, women face direct discrimination by 
men (or even other women) who decline to hire them for high-paying posi-
tions or to pay them as much as a man might earn in the same position. 
This discrimination continues to happen for many of the same reasons 
that racial discrimination continues to happen (see previous section).
 
✓ Different career timing. Though parental leave is today widely available 
for fathers as well as mothers, women remain more likely than men to 
take time off for childbearing — and to take more time off when they do. 
This time off can put them at a disadvantage when competing for raises 
and promotions with colleagues who have been working continuously, 
even if their total experience is comparable.
 
✓ A segmented labor market. Among careers, some are especially domi-
nated by women (nursing, teaching, library work) and others are espe-
cially dominated by men (construction jobs, computing, engineering). 
On average, male-dominated fields are higher-paying. This means that 
women are — whether by choice or for other reasons — concentrated in 
relatively low-paying careers, and when they try to enter higher-paying 
careers, they are especially vulnerable to discrimination.

171
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
This being true, women are quickly catching up with men; in education, they 
have already surpassed men in most of the developed world. Increasingly, 
attention is turning to the challenges boys face in school, which may be 
related to challenges some men face in the workplace. Just as surely as 
women, men find themselves with a stereotypical role to play, and may be 
punished in the form of scorn or discrimination if they fail to play the role 
as they’re “supposed” to. For both men and women, gender roles still very 
much matter — in all societies.
 
If someone chooses a role or lifestyle that’s considered “traditional” for their 
gender doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ve been brainwashed. It’s typical 
for mothers to work outside the home in many societies today, but choosing 
not to work outside the home is a choice that many mothers are proud to 
make.
Should gender matter on the job market?
I did a lot of babysitting when I was in high 
school, so when I arrived at college in another 
city, one of the first things I did was to go to 
the college employment office and submit my 
résumé for possible employment in child care. 
The woman at the desk was thrilled to get my 
application — they almost never, she said, 
received child care applications from men. “But 
I have to tell you,” she warned me, “you won’t 
be hired.” Why? “Because when a parent calls 
me, I’ll give them three names: yours, and the 
names of two women. They’ll call the women 
first.” She was right; I never did get a call from 
any parent who was given my name through 
that service.
Was I the victim of sex discrimination? 
Absolutely, and it would be illegal for the 
owners of a public child care facility to selec-
tively interview only females for employment. 
Why would the parents — likely, professors 
who considered themselves open-minded 
people — act that way?
When it comes to their children, any parent 
is likely to be very risk-averse: There’s noth-
ing in the world that’s more important than the 
happiness and safety of one’s children. On 
average, women will be more experienced at 
child care than men; children who have never 
had a male babysitter will likely be more star-
tled and upset at a new male babysitter than at 
a new female babysitter; and it’s an undisputed 
fact that the large majority of sex offenders 
are male. From the standpoint of an individual 
parent, it makes all the sense in the world not to 
take a chance on a man when you have quali-
fied women who might babysit your children.
When large numbers of parents act this way, 
though, you can see the pattern that will inevita-
bly emerge: Qualified men will be unable to find 
employment in child care, and in many cases 
will probably seek employment in another field, 
perpetuating the gender division in child care. 
This is an illustration of Thomas’s maxim that 
a situation defined as real (men are unsuit-
able for child care) becomes real in its conse-
quences (few men seek or find employment in 
child care). You can see how this effect might 
work the other way around when it comes to 
construction work or other male-dominated 
occupations.

172
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
GBLTQ rights and the deconstruction 
of gender
“GBLTQ” is an alphabet soup of a term; it stands for gay, bisexual, lesbian, 
transgender, and queer. Some members of the GBLTQ community identify 
with one of these terms, some identify with multiple of them. Some people 
who identify with the term “gay” find the term “queer” to be derogatory and 
inappropriate, while others who identify with a “queer” identity consider 
terms like “gay” and “lesbian” to be restrictive and outmoded. So the term 
“GBLTQ” (or, sometimes, simply “GBLT”) is used to include everyone whose 
sexual orientation is other than — or at least broader than — heterosexual.
The term is a little awkward — it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and 
it unites people who don’t necessarily always want to be united. But it’s 
become necessary as societies around the world have increasingly come to 
see sexual orientation as something that individuals are free to determine 
for themselves. Whether that means “straight,” whether it means “queer,” 
whether it means “lesbian,” or whether it means something else is for each 
individual to say.
The widespread recognition of sexual orientations other than heterosexual 
as valid and healthy is relatively new — it wasn’t that long ago that most 
psychologists considered homosexuality to be a mental disorder — and it’s 
still unclear where laws and customs regarding sexual orientation will go in 
the future. Many consider the debate over sexual orientation to be a moral 
debate, and you may be among them; but remember that sociology is about 
looking at the big picture and setting aside your personal views so that you 
can understand society objectively. From a sociological standpoint, the 
debate over GBLTQ rights can be seen as the next step in the overall debate 
over sex and gender.
If you’re allowed to decide whether you work, where you work, and whom 
and when you marry despite your biological sex, it follows logically that 
many people will want to decide for themselves who they have sex with and 
when — and whether that other person is a man or a woman. However you 
feel personally about the matter, the fact that sexual orientation is increas-
ingly regarded as a matter of personal choice is consistent with what sociolo-
gists would expect given many of the other sociological ideas in this book. 
(By “personal choice,” I don’t mean to say that people aren’t born with one 
sexual orientation or another. I mean to say that from a social and legal 
standpoint, people are increasingly allowed to say for themselves what their 
sexual orientation is rather than being told by someone else what it is.)

173
 Chapter 9: Gender and Ethnicity: I Know My Race, But Where’s the Finish Line?
 
✓ Sociologists of culture (see Chapter 5) are seeing a transition to “micro-
cultures,” where groups of people who identify with one another are 
able to come together from across a range of social backgrounds. This 
means that people who consider themselves, say, queer can share a 
common culture that may be different than mainstream cultures.
 
✓ Sociologists of race and ethnicity (see earlier sections in this chapter) 
have seen that “race” is losing legitimacy as a category people are born 
into and that determines what they can or should do with their lives. Sex 
is changing in the same way — it’s increasingly seen as something indi-
viduals can and should express for themselves.
 
✓ Sociologists studying social change (see Chapter 16), from Durkheim 
to Weber, have all observed that individuals are increasingly seen as 
having the right to say for themselves what they’ll do and with whom 
they’ll associate. There’s no reason that association in bed should prove 
to be an exception to that rule.
It’s often said that governments are getting “out of the bedroom,” but soci-
ologist David John Frank, who has studied international changes in sex laws, 
says that that’s not exactly true. On the one hand, it is true that some sexual 
activities that were once forbidden by law — for example, gay sex — have 
increasingly been permitted by law in countries around the world. On the 
other hand, some sexual activities that were once permitted — for example, 
a husband forcing his wife to have sex with him — have been increasingly 
made illegal. The common theme is that laws around the world have been 
changing, for decades, in favor of allowing individuals to decide for them-
selves what intimate activities they are going to participate in, and when, and 
with whom.
Race, Ethnicity, Sex, and Gender: 
Why They Still Matter
If it’s true — and it is — that in societies around the world, all individuals 
increasingly have the right to choose for themselves what they will do, with 
whom they will do it, and what identities they will choose, are ideas like 
race, ethnicity, sex, and gender outdated? Does it even matter what race or 
ethnicity or sex or gender you are? Why even bother having an ethnicity or a 
gender, or a particular sexual orientation? Some people feel this way; in fact, 
there are people who identify their sexual orientation as “omnisexual,” claim-
ing complete freedom to be intimate with anyone they happen to be attracted 
to. As people from different races and ethnicities mix more and more, maybe 
“omniracial” and “omniethnic” identities will also increasingly be adopted.

174
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
That probably will happen, but sociologists believe that race, ethnicity, sex, 
and gender aren’t “going away” any time soon. Those concepts are grounded 
deep in the fabric of every society, and saying that they don’t matter any 
more is simply false. No matter where you live, your physical features and 
biological sex are going to influence how the people around you see you, and 
they’re going to influence how you see yourself.
Ethnicity may be an “option” for some people, but although ethnicity (unlike 
race) is not determined by how others see you, that doesn’t mean it’s easy 
to renounce the ethnicity you were raised in — even if you want to. Novels 
like The House on Mango Street (by Sandra Cisneros) and Portnoy’s Complaint 
(by Philip Roth), films like Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain and Tyler Perry’s 
The Family That Preys, and plays like Fences (by August Wilson) and Angels in 
America (by Tony Kushner) movingly depict people’s struggles to reconcile 
their personal hopes and dreams with the strengths and limitations of the 
ethnic communities to which they belong.
Similarly, sex and gender are increasingly complicated categories that remain 
just as meaningful to individuals as they were when they were simpler. Your 
sex, your gender, and your sexual orientation are part of who you are, and 
though societies increasingly allow you to decide how and when you will 
express your gender and your sexual orientation — and, also increasingly, 
forbid others to judge you by them — that doesn’t mean that your sex and 
your gender don’t matter profoundly to you, and to others.
 
If you’re confused or frustrated trying to understand your own race, ethnicity, 
sex, or gender, you’re not alone! Many groups exist to help people find sup-
port and advice about their identity, no matter what it is. A visit to a coun-
selor, a trip to the library, a quick Web search, or even a conversation with a 
caring listener can help connect you with other people who are wrestling with 
the same concerns you are.

Getting Religion: 
Faith in the Modern World
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding religion in history
▶ Separating religious theory from religious practice
▶ Shopping for God
A
fter 13 years in Catholic school, when I arrived at my first compara-
tive religion course in college, I wondered how the professor was 
going to handle the fact that not all religions could be right. I wasn’t sure 
that Catholicism was entirely “right,” but I figured they couldn’t all be right. 
Members of different religions have very different beliefs about the spiritual 
world; I wasn’t sure how you could study religion without taking a position 
on which set of beliefs were “correct.”
I soon realized that my professor was not going to tell us which religion was 
right; whatever her personal religious beliefs, they weren’t the point. When 
social scientists — sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists — study reli-
gion, they are not studying God (or gods), they are studying people. It’s the 
job of theologians and philosophers to study the hereafter; social scientists 
study the here and now.
And religion is indeed very much here and now. Every day, billions of people 
around the world pray and gather to share their faith, whatever that might 
be. Religious practices and organizations have always been at the heart of 
the social world, and for a sociologist to ignore religion would be like a physi-
cian ignoring the nose on your face. So sociologists have studied religion, just 
as they’ve studied every other major feature of society.
In this chapter, I first outline the important early sociologists’ ideas about 
religion. Then, I explain the difference between religious beliefs or values and 
the organizations that support people’s religious practices. Finally, I encour-
age you to think about the relationship between religious belief and social 
action in the world today.

176
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Understanding Religion in History
When sociologists first set out to understand how society works, they imme-
diately appreciated that their theories had to account for religion. Karl Marx, 
Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber all had ideas about the role of religion in 
society. In this section, I explain each of their theories in turn. (For more on 
Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, see Chapter 3.)
Marx: Opiate of the people
Many people see religion as being at the core of their lives, at the heart of what 
makes them happy. Most sociologists believe that religion is mostly, if not 
always, a constructive force in society. There are, however, some sociologists 
who believe that religion has an impact on society that is by and large nega-
tive, even destructive. The most famous of those sociologists is Karl Marx.
Marx believed that understanding society was fundamentally about under-
standing power, and that power was fundamentally tied to what he called 
“the means of production.” If I own the field that you need to grow food, or 
the machinery you need to build a home, or the company you need to work 
at to earn money, I have power over you. It doesn’t particularly matter what 
you believe about the situation; what matters is the material reality of the 
situation, which is that you will starve unless you do as I want.
Marx was personally a skeptic, and his social theory reflected his belief that 
any promise of divine reward for hard work and a “good life” was empty; that 
people without power in the here and now should not count on justice being 
done in the hereafter.
Many theologians and people of faith believe that earthly suffering happens 
for a reason, whether or not that reason can be understood by those who are 
suffering; Marx believed that whether or not that was the case, the affect of 
religion in the societies he could observe was largely to distract people from 
fighting for fair treatment.
If a person is barely getting by, working hard all day and being given only a 
fraction of the profit their work is earning for their employer, that is wrong, 
thought Marx — and if a person’s religious belief that they would reap rewards 
in heaven deterred that person from fighting for fair treatment on earth, that 
would be bad. Religion, thought Marx, tends to get in the way of human happi-
ness. It lulls people to sleep and keeps them from recognizing the injustice of 
their surroundings; that’s why he called it “the opiate of the people.”

177
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
Most sociologists today find Marx’s views extreme, and you might too — but 
his ideas are important to think about. Marx was skeptical of not only reli-
gion, but of anything that kept people from questioning the status quo. That 
could include all or any of these phenomena:
 
✓ Advertisements for expensive products that you “need to have”
 
✓ Politicians who say that people who have different policy ideas than 
they do are “unpatriotic”
 
✓ Traditions that keep members of a certain sex or race in a subservient 
position because “it’s always been that way”
Whether or not they agree with Marx, sociologists do agree that it’s hard to 
understand the social world if you approach it with a set of preconceptions 
about how things are “supposed” to be. At the heart of Marx’s criticism of 
religion is a rejection of anything that keeps people from working towards a 
society that is fair for everyone.
Some communist governments based on Marx’s ideas have tried to eradicate 
religion altogether, but they haven’t been entirely successful. A man who 
would not be surprised at that is Emile Durkheim, who believed that religion 
is an essential feature of a healthy society.
Emile Durkheim: A metaphor for society
Emile Durkheim didn’t agree with Marx that religion was a destructive 
force in society. Why, asked Durkheim, would something destructive be at 
the center of virtually every society ever known? It just didn’t make sense. 
Durkheim believed that religion must serve a function in society, must do 
something to help people work together happily and productively.
Marx thought that religion was an “opiate,” something that put people to 
sleep and kept them from standing up for themselves. Durkheim agreed that 
religion helped encourage people to trust others, but unlike Marx, Durkheim 
believed that this was by and large a good thing. If every man and woman 
just looked out for themselves, believed Durkheim, society would fall apart. 
Sharing religious beliefs, values, and practices helps people recognize what 
they have in common, and helps encourage them to set aside their differ-
ences and make personal sacrifices for the good of society. Religion, said 
Durkheim, is one of the essential institutions in any society.
Durkheim’s ideas about religion are especially interesting with respect 
to social change. Societies change over time, Durkheim observed — from 
Africa to Asia to America to Europe, societies tend to follow a general path 

178
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
of evolution from relatively simple tribal societies to complex industrial 
societies, even if they don’t follow that path at the same pace. Further, 
Durkheim noticed, the religious beliefs and practices of those societies 
tended to change as well — which only makes sense. If a society is chang-
ing, and religion is at the heart of that society, then religion needs to 
change too!
 
Durkheim believed that religion helped societies maintain their solidarity . . . 
but what kind of solidarity a society needs, thought Durkheim, changes over 
the course of its history. In this way, religion is a metaphor for society itself.
Mechanical solidarity
Early on in any society’s history, people’s lives are similar and it’s useful for 
them to follow very specific rules: rules about where to go and when, rules 
about what responsibilities are associated with various social statuses, 
rules about specific rituals and practices. Durkheim called this mechanical 
solidarity because people need to “mechanically” follow very specific rules, 
or the society could be in danger. The society’s needs are too specific, and 
too pressing, for individuals to decide for themselves what practices they’re 
going to follow.
Sure enough, noticed Durkheim, religious beliefs in simple societies tend to 
be very specific and ritualistic. Members of these societies tend to believe 
in divinities who make specific demands on people and who have human-
like personalities. There may be a rain god who will be angered unless a 
specific ritual is followed, or a war god who has clear ideas about how ter-
ritorial incursions ought to be dealt with. The Judeo-Christian God of the Old 
Testament fairly micromanages His people, showing up in a column of smoke 
or a burning bush to have conversations with mortals and hand down precise 
edicts. For Durkheim, this was the essence of mechanical solidarity.
Organic solidarity
As societies grow and become more complex, noticed Durkheim, it’s less 
workable for everyone in a society to follow the same specific rules and prac-
tices. People’s lives become much more diverse, and if everyone followed the 
same very precise set of rules and rituals, the social system would grind to a 
halt. What’s more useful is for people to follow a general set of common prin-
ciples that can be applied to diverse situations. Durkheim called this organic 
solidarity because people in complex societies need to organically adapt their 
behavior to the particular situations they’re in.
As societies move toward organic solidarity, Durkheim pointed out, their 
religious beliefs tend to become more diffuse and general. Members of these 
societies are less likely to believe in gods with human-like personalities making 
concrete demands on mortals; instead, members of big, complex societies are 
likely to believe in gods who are at a greater remove from humanity. People 
have general ideas about what kind of behavior these divinities want, but they 
are less likely to go through their days attending to specific rituals. In general, 

179
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
Christians today decreasingly identify with the personal God of the Old 
Testament; rather, they identify with the God of the New Testament, who loves 
His children and wants them to care for one another but is unlikely to show 
up on Earth to tell them exactly what to do in any given situation. This, for 
Durkheim, is what organic solidarity is all about.
The bottom line
Durkheim’s theory is challenging, and may seem hard to understand, but 
here’s the bottom line about what Durkheim believed:
 
✓ Religion is an essential feature of society. It encourages cooperation and 
mutual respect.
 
✓ Because of this, as society changes, religion needs to change also — and 
it does.
To understand how this works, consider the separation of church and state, 
which was a core belief of the founders of the United States. No church, they 
believed, had any business directly influencing a country’s laws. To this day, 
citizens of the United States are free to practice any religion without interfer-
ence from the government; government leaders are not allowed to make laws 
that favor one religion over another. This is also the case in most other coun-
tries around the world . . . but it hasn’t always been that way.
For most of human history, church leaders have had official influence on 
laws and social structure. In many cases, religious leaders essentially were 
the leaders of governments. People whose religious beliefs were contrary to 
those of the leaders could be punished, even killed, for their beliefs. Horrible 
though this was, Durkheim would say that in societies bound by mechani-
cal solidarity it made sense. If you believe that there’s a divinity who has 
very specific ideas about what you should do and when, that divinity might 
well have ideas that conflict with others’. In this kind of society, it’s hard for 
people of different faiths to live and work together.
In societies bound by organic solidarity, on the other hand, people tend 
to believe in divinities who have relatively general notions of acceptable 
behavior: Treat others as you would want to be treated. Don’t kill. Don’t 
steal. Be honest. People today don’t tend to believe in divinities who pre-
scribe specific styles of dress or specific hard-and-fast social roles for 
people of different sexes, races, or families of birth. People with this kind of 
religious belief have a much easier time living and working together, and it 
makes sense for governments to allow them to do so without following the 
exact same religious traditions.
Where things get hairy in these situations is when people need to follow spe-
cific religious practices that conflict with civic laws. That’s a relatively rare 
situation, but it does happen — you can probably think of some examples — 
and it can cause a flurry of debate, even violent debate. Social solidarity isn’t 
always easy!

Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Max Weber, the last of the “big three” early sociologists, agreed with 
Durkheim that religion changes along with society — but he didn’t think 
there was necessarily anything “mechanical” or “organic” about it.
Weber: A switchman on the tracks
Max Weber agreed with Durkheim that religion was a fundamentally impor-
tant part of society, but Weber also noticed that religion didn’t always lead 
to peace, love, and understanding. There’s no question, agreed Weber, that 
religious beliefs and values fundamentally affect the way that people lead 
their lives — but whereas Durkheim believed that changes in the social struc-
ture would more or less inevitably lead to changes in religious beliefs, Weber 
believed that it often worked the other way around: that religious beliefs and 
values led to widespread social change.
In Chapter 3, I mention Weber’s view of religion as a “switchman on the 
tracks.” Specifically, Weber wrote about the importance of the Protestant 
values of hard work and thrift in the development of modern capitalist soci-
ety. If theologians like Martin Luther and John Calvin hadn’t promoted these 
values, believed Weber, modern capitalism would probably never have suc-
ceeded. It’s not that Luther and Calvin exactly wanted to bring about a capi-
talist society, but the values they preached nonetheless led to that outcome, 
said Weber. Both Marx and Durkheim, on the other hand, believed that the 
arrival of capitalism was basically inevitable and would have happened with 
or without “the Protestant Ethic.”
Weber used the “switchman on the tracks” metaphor to acknowledge that 
not all outcomes are possible in society — there are distinct sets of “tracks” 
that a society might follow, depending on how things turn out. Which set 
they choose, though, may be determined by religious or cultural values. (See 
Chapter 5 for more on culture.)
Many sociologists today lean towards Weber’s view of religion rather than 
Marx’s or Durkheim’s because Weber’s view makes room for both cohesion 
and conflict:
 
✓ Like Durkheim, Weber appreciated that religious values, beliefs, and 
traditions can serve as a powerful form of social glue holding people 
together and helping them cooperate to achieve shared goals.
 
✓ Like Marx, though, Weber also understood that religious values don’t 
always line up with social realities — and that they can lead to unneces-
sary conflict.
Marx believed that religion leads to conflict and exploitation while Durkheim 
believed that religion leads to cooperation and unity. Weber understood that 
both of those perspectives might be correct.

181
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
 
As much peace and happiness as religion has brought to people, as much as 
religious ceremonies and rituals are among the most treasured moments in 
people’s lives, it’s also true that (sincerely held, if distorted) religious values 
have served as the basis for some of the worst atrocities in human history — 
from the 15th-century Inquisition to 21st-century suicide bombers.
Religion in Theory . . . and in Practice
When studying religion, sociologists distinguish between the religious beliefs 
that people hold and the organizations that they form to facilitate their reli-
gious practices. In this section, I first explain how sociologists think about reli-
gious beliefs, then I explain how sociologists study religious organizations.
Religious ideas, ideology, and values
For any one individual, personal religious beliefs are often at the core of their 
religious experience — often, indeed, at the very core of everything that’s 
important to them. They may feel a deep and true connection to a larger 
world than that which we can see here on Earth. This is true of sociologists 
as well, most of whom are people of faith and practice some form of worship 
with their families in private.
When they put on their sociological lab coats, though, they must acknowl-
edge that questions about the hereafter can’t be answered empirically. That’s 
what separates religious beliefs from other beliefs: they are matters of faith 
or philosophy rather than matters that can be tested with empirical observa-
tions. (See Chapter 4 for more on sociological research and empirical obser-
vations.) To study religion from a sociological standpoint, you need to focus 
on aspects of religion that can be observed in the here and now.
You can’t, of course, directly observe someone’s mind — or, if you prefer, 
soul. What you can observe is what they say, what they write, what they 
read, and what they do. Early sociologists like Marx, Durkheim, and Weber 
were interested in history and anthropology; they spent a great deal of time 
studying how religious beliefs had changed over time and varied across dif-
ferent societies in their own times.
What they found — and what many other sociologists, anthropologists, histo-
rians, and other scholars of religion have found — is that religious beliefs and 
values, intensely personal as they feel to any given individual, are generally 
shared by people in particular times and places. Further, they change over 
time in a way that doesn’t seem to be random. So why do they change over 
time? Why do they vary among different societies?

182
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Though they disagree about specifically why religious beliefs and values 
vary over time and among different societies, sociologists agree that those 
changes are typically related to changes in society.
Marx believed that religious values change to suit the interests of the 
powerful.
Durkheim believed that religious values change naturally as societies 
grow and become more complex.
Weber believed that religious values, as propagated by charismatic reli-
gious leaders, both influence and are influenced by social change.
It might be disorienting to think that religious belief and values have anything 
to do with society. After all, many people of faith believe that religious belief 
is a kind of antidote to social change, providing a compass for the faithful to 
sail by regardless of which way the prevailing cultural winds are blowing.
That belief is not inconsistent with a sociological view of faith. After all, the 
essential reason sociologists are interested in religious values is precisely 
because they do influence action. If religious belief were an entirely personal 
matter that had no affect whatsoever on anyone’s actions, it would clearly be 
beyond the scope of sociological study.
What makes religious belief a matter of interest to sociologists is the fact that 
people’s religious values do — or, at least, can — influence their actions. For 
many people, religious beliefs do provide a compass that acts like, to use 
Weber’s terms, a “switchman on the tracks” that influences what they will do 
in a given situation.
In Weber’s example of the “Protestant Ethic,” this meant that people who 
might have worked only as hard as they needed to get by day to day decided, 
instead, to work as hard as they could, to scrimp and save and to amass 
wealth. In your life, a religious belief that stealing is wrong may influence 
your decision not to take advantage of a situation where you could steal 
something and get away with it.
So for this reason (plus out of simple curiosity), sociologists are interested in 
why and how religious values change — and they have discovered that reli-
gious values do change, and change in ways related to changes in society.
 
You may believe it should not be the case that religious values change; you 
may believe that there is a single truth — whether it be found in the Bible, the 
Koran, the Torah, or elsewhere — that applies to all people, in all times. That 
may well be the case, but sociology studies the world as it is, not as anyone 
believes it should be, and the empirical reality is that religious beliefs are not 
constant.

 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
Open the church: Religious organizations
When you were a kid, someone might have taught you the game where you 
clasp your hands together and recite the rhyme, “Here is the church, here 
is the steeple, open the doors and see all the people,” wiggling your fingers 
to represent the congregation. Although religion is for many people a purely 
personal experience, most people — whatever their religious beliefs — gather 
with others for worship, mutual support, and perhaps to work together for 
goals consistent with their faith.
This means that in large part, the sociological study of religion is the study 
of religious organizations. Whereas members of religious organizations are 
united by faith rather than by the desire to make a profit, play a sport, or 
save the whales, religious organizations share many of the characteristics 
of organizations like corporations, teams, and nonprofits. (In fact, in most 
countries they are considered nonprofit organizations.) They have rules and 
bylaws, they set goals, create budgets, raise revenue, and elect or otherwise 
choose leaders.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, in centuries past (and in many societies 
today) religious organizations essentially were governments, taking direct 
responsibility for not just holding worship services but also managing the 
economic system, waging war, and enforcing laws. In most societies today 
religious organizations are separate from governments, and the primary task 
of many religious organizations is simply to maintain places of worship and 
offer religious services every day or week.
Many, though, set more ambitious goals. Churches and religious groups have 
been, and continue to be, directly instrumental in many aspects of society.
 
✓ Martin Luther King, Jr. was a minister, and churches were deeply 
involved in the American Civil Rights Movement.
 
✓ In almost every country, religious groups are among the most important 
groups offering aid to the needy through shelters, food shelves, and eco-
nomic assistance.
 
✓ Many religious groups run schools that offer secular instruction in read-
ing, writing, and ‘rithmatic along with religious education.
 
✓ It’s common for religious groups to advocate for one side or another 
of a civic political issue — anything from health care to international 
relations — and to mobilize support for that position.
This important role that religious groups play in society is yet another reason 
sociologists appreciate that religion is an integral part of society.

184
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
In the lives of believers, religious organizations may play a role well beyond 
facilitating worship. It’s common for religious communities to host meals and 
social gatherings, as well as to provide opportunities for members to engage 
in public service or recreation together. Recent decades have seen the rise of 
suburban “megachurches,” massive structures housing huge congregations. 
Members of these congregations may visit church every day whether to wor-
ship, study the Bible, relax at the coffee shop, watch a movie, or even work 
out on the church’s exercise equipment. Especially for people who feel that 
their values aren’t reflected in mainstream culture, it can be very satisfying 
to have a place to gather where they know they will be surrounded by people 
who share their beliefs.
Even when religious organizations don’t have an official role in governance, 
they can virtually define neighborhood communities. My father grew up in St. 
Paul, Minnesota, and he still talks about the city not in terms of neighborhoods 
Cops, churches, and the “Boston Miracle”
In the 1990s, violence — especially youth vio-
lence — in the city of Boston plummeted. In 
1990, there were 152 murders in Boston, but in 
1999 there were just 31; for a period of two and 
a half years in the late 90s, there were exactly 
zero teenage homicide victims in Boston. This 
amazing development became known as the 
“Boston Miracle.”
Why did this happen? The Boston Police 
Department points with justifiable pride to 
a unique program that began in the early 
1990s, where cops joined forces with African-
American religious leaders to fight youth vio-
lence. Inner-city churches held community 
meetings where ministers and police officers 
stood side by side to form a united front, telling 
young gang members that their behavior was 
destructive and had to stop. Many of the kids 
got the message, and many of those who didn’t 
were apprehended and imprisoned — with the 
cooperation of people in the communities they 
were terrorizing.
Sociologist Christopher Winship has been study-
ing crime and policing in Boston neighborhoods 
for decades, and he agrees that the cop-church 
partnership played an important role in reduc-
ing violence in Boston — though he points out 
that violent crime dropped in many U.S. cities 
in the 1990s, suggesting that in some ways 
Boston was simply part of a national trend. 
What Winship thinks may be most impressive 
about the Boston partnership is the way that 
it’s helped to minimize specifically racial vio-
lence in a city that saw terrible racial tension 
the 1970s and 1980s. The fact that black minis-
ters have been seen publicly working with the 
police, Winship believes, has helped the entire 
community focus on fighting crime rather than 
pointing fingers at people because of the color 
of their skin.
The success of the Boston partnership — which 
continues, successfully, to this day — shows 
the continuing importance of religious organi-
zations, especially in communities where other 
civic organizations are mistrusted. Because the 
Boston ministers had the trust and respect of 
their communities, they were able to help the 
police make those communities safer.

185
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
but in terms of Catholic parishes, which is how he grew up thinking about the 
city’s geography. “They live in St. Marks,” he’ll say, or “she bought a house 
down there in Nativity.” In communities where religious organizations and 
civic life are closely intertwined, religion can even function like race or ethnic-
ity. (“People say we didn’t have any minorities in St. Paul when I was growing 
up,” jokes my dad. “Of course we did . . . we had Lutherans!”)
Although they’re like other social organizations in many ways, religious orga-
nizations have a unique relationship with their members because believers 
see them as representing a here-and-now connection to the spiritual world, 
the eternal realm that, for many believers, is much more important than any-
thing in this world. This gives religious organizations a special power that can 
be tremendously constructive — as with organizations that help hold commu-
nities together in times of war or strife — or tremendously destructive — as in 
the case of corrupt cults that exploit their members financially and otherwise. 
For billions of people, religious organizations are among the most important 
social organizations in their lives.
Faith and Freedom in the World Today
In today’s world, where most societies maintain a separation between 
church and state and where immigration and other factors are leading to 
increasing religious diversity everywhere, religion is an especially compli-
cated subject. Faith remains central to billions of people’s lives, but what 
implications does that have for their actions? In this section, I describe 
trends in religious participation and look at the circumstances under which 
faith translates into action.
Shopping for God
Sociologists distinguish between faith (or beliefs, or values) and action. A 
high proportion of people in the world today attend religious services, but an 
even greater proportion express a belief in a higher power. These are both 
important indexes of religiosity, but they measure different things.
The distinction is particularly important in today’s world, where people in 
many societies have considerable freedom to express whatever beliefs they 
like and whether or not to act on them. In the United States, for example, 
a large majority of people say they believe in a higher power, and nearly 
half say they regularly attend religious services; this has declined in recent 
decades (especially if you look at whether people actually attend services 
and not whether they say they do), but not as quickly as in Europe, where the 
rate of belief is falling and the rate of attendance is falling faster.

186
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
In many respects, religion in the contemporary world is becoming a con-
sumer good: something you choose to “buy” because it satisfies a need you 
have. This may seem like a heretical, or even offensive, way to look at some-
thing so profoundly personal, but it does describe the behavior religious 
organizations have been demonstrating — and, in fact, the way many people 
think about religion.
People in free societies do have the ability to choose for themselves whether 
or not they’ll participate in a religious organization — and if so, which organi-
zation they’ll participate in. Most religious organizations welcome converts, 
and they realize that people may be swayed by many factors when choosing 
a religious orientation generally and a particular community specifically. 
People may consider:
 
✓ Their personal sense of the supernatural world, preferring organizations 
that resonate with their most deeply-felt beliefs.
 
✓ The family and tradition in which they were raised, possibly preferring 
an organization with beliefs, rituals, and a structure that mirror the ones 
they grew up with.
Conservative Christian culture: A world apart
One of the most striking developments on the 
religious landscape over the past several 
decades has been the emergence of a coor-
dinated, well-defined coalition of conservative 
Christians. Particularly in the United States, 
where it’s known as “the religious right,” this 
movement — under the leadership of massively 
influential leaders like James Dobson — has 
played an important role in defining and influ-
encing the national debate over issues ranging 
from abortion to capital punishment to taxation 
and budgeting.
The movement is controversial not just because 
of its strong policy views, but because of its 
unapologetic insistence that religion belongs 
at the heart of any political or social debate. 
Members of the movement have argued that 
removing religious symbols from government 
buildings and forbidding judges and lawmakers 
to invoke religious beliefs in their deliberations 
has potentially disastrous consequences for 
American public life.
The movement is also distinctive for having 
given birth to a vast array of consumer prod-
ucts aimed at those who don’t feel mainstream 
products reflect their values. From music to lit-
erature to TV to movies, there’s an entire alter-
nate universe of explicitly Christian products 
aimed at the faithful; some of these, like the Left 
Behind novels, sell as well as or better than their 
mainstream counterparts. Even on the Internet, 
there are Christian search engines, Christian 
social networking sites, and a Christian video 
site called “GodTube.”
In some ways, this movement is a textbook 
example of a subculture (see Chapter 5): a 
culture formed in conscious opposition to a 
mainstream culture. In other ways, though, 
the movement embraces the realities of main-
stream politics and entertainment; its members 
are enthusiastically using the freedom contem-
porary society affords them to choose their own 
faith, their own entertainment, their own social 
world.

187
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
 
✓ The social values of a denomination or a congregation, preferring to 
worship among people who share their commitment to a set of social 
policies or public service interests.
 
✓ The other members of a congregation, looking — for example — for a 
congregation with many young families, or many active seniors.
 
✓ Geography, preferring to attend service in their own neighborhoods.
 
✓ Other services offered by a congregation: schooling for children, 
classes or workshops for adults, outings, and other features of life 
in that community.
Religious organizations recognize that people have a choice in their religious 
affiliations, and the organizations often respond by advertising themselves 
in ways ranging from flyers at the back of the sanctuary to billboards or even 
radio and TV ads. Churches in neighborhoods with many gay or lesbian resi-
dents may display rainbow banners, and churches looking to attract families 
with young children may advertise their daycare centers or Sunday School 
offerings.
Do people actually think about religion this way? Do they actually think about 
faith as something to be shopped for, like cereal or a winter coat?
In some ways, of course not. Faith is a deeply personal, sometimes highly 
sensitive subject, and many of the faithful would rightly bristle at any sugges-
tion that they would treat a church like a vacation destination.
That said, it is true that in societies where people do have the freedom to 
choose their faith and the ways in which they practice it, they tend to exer-
cise that freedom. A 2009 Pew survey showed that 44 percent of American 
adults do not belong to the faith in which they were raised — some have 
switched affiliations, some have simply stopped practicing. Another 9 per-
cent switched faiths at some point before returning to their childhood faith.
Of course, people convert for many reasons. As network sociologists (see 
Chapter 7) and those studying social movements (Chapter 13) have dis-
covered, it’s rare that people change their behaviors out of thin air. In 
many cases, religious conversion is the result of an interfaith friendship or 
romance; a new work situation; or a move from one place to another. Often, 
action follows belief . . . but often, it’s the other way around.
Belief, action, and everything in between
So, again, why do sociologists care about religion? What business of theirs 
is it to whom people pray, or where people expect to go after they die? It’s 
because religion is not something that exists merely in your head or your 
soul; it’s also, typically, something you do.

188
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
 
✓ You might join a religious organization, which may be of pivotal impor-
tance in your community.
 
✓ Your faith might affect the votes you cast in polling places (that is, influ-
ence your political views) and the votes you cast in shopping malls (that 
is, influence the things you buy).
 
✓ Religion can affect your social networks, which in turn affects everything 
else you do.
These are all reasons that religion is important for sociologists, political sci-
entists, and economists to consider when studying the social world. But does 
faith directly affect people’s actions? From a sociological standpoint, does it 
matter what you believe, beyond it simply mattering that you believe?
Of course it does. The question is when and how.
All the major sociological theories about religion emphasize that faith some-
how influences people’s actions — not just by influencing them to build build-
ings and form organizations and buy books, but by influencing them to take 
specific actions in this world consistent with their beliefs about the next world.
Marx believed religion was relatively unimportant; however, he argued 
that in some circumstances religion could serve the interests of the pow-
erful, by discouraging people from challenging the status quo. Marx was 
particularly wary of faiths that offered the promise of heavenly rewards 
because he believed that people who expected to be rewarded in heaven 
might be less likely to demand their just desserts on Earth.
Durkheim believed that religion was key to social solidarity. He believed 
that religious teachings and ceremonies teach people how to get along in 
society, and make it less likely that people will pursue personal goals that 
are at odds with larger social goals. In earlier societies, this meant that 
they were often encouraged to be intolerant of diversity (because diver-
sity can be dangerous when there are a few very specific tasks that need 
to be accomplished); today, this means that they are often encouraged 
to welcome diversity (because intolerance can be dangerous when many 
different kinds of people need to get along despite having very different 
tasks to accomplish).
Weber believed that religious values could influence people’s actions in 
any number of ways. He believed that religious values consistent with 
capitalism helped that economic system get off the ground. Religious 
values, for Weber, don’t completely determine the direction a society 
will take; nor do they necessarily change to match a social structure. 
There’s always a back-and-forth interaction between religious values 
and other social forces.
In all these theories, specific religious beliefs and values directly influence peo-
ple’s actions beyond the walls of the church or the synagogue. Most sociolo-
gists of religion today lean more toward the perspective of Weber than towards 

189
 Chapter 10: Getting Religion: Faith in the Modern World
the perspectives of Marx or Durkheim because Weber has more appreciation 
for the complex interactions among religious institutions and other social 
institutions. Religion matters, but the specific way it matters will depend on the 
structure of any given society as well as the nature of religious beliefs.
Religion can be profoundly important in people’s lives, influencing all the 
actions they take. It can also, at least in today’s world, be completely absent 
from a person’s life. A person can claim no religious affiliation, and have per-
sonal beliefs about the hereafter (or lack thereof) that have no bearing on 
their actions in the here and now. What’s more, the place of religion in the 
structure of a society can vary: In some societies, even today, religious insti-
tutions are synonymous with the state, and religious practices are closely 
monitored and enforced. In other societies, religious institutions are com-
pletely separate from the state, and have little political clout.
Compared to most places and times in the past, religious beliefs and prac-
tices in the world today are incredibly diverse — and people with diverse 
religious beliefs and practices are increasingly rubbing elbows in societies 
around the world. That makes it harder to generalize about the role of reli-
gion in social life, but it doesn’t make religion any less important.
Today, religion brings people together as it always has. Every week, billions of 
people around the world gather in living rooms, public squares, and private 
houses of worship to share their faith and share their community. Whether 
their faith is the only one they’ve ever known or whether they’ve converted 
from another creed, whether they live in places where everyone has the same 
religious affiliation or whether their neighbors all subscribe to different reli-
gious views, religion offers them solace and support. It links them to a larger 
social world and, according to their beliefs, to a spiritual world as well.
Religion also, however, sometimes inspires, fuels, and justifies terrible con-
flict and violence. In some cases, this violence is a direct extension of faith — 
some people genuinely believe that they have a divine imperative to act in a 
hostile manner towards those who do not share their beliefs — but in most 
cases, religious distinctions merely serve to highlight and exacerbate other 
divisions. When religious differences happen to coincide with differences of 
ethnicity or class, conflicts along those lines can take on an especially bitter 
character. Social activists interested in working towards a just world have 
always seen it as downright tragic that distinctions of religion and race can 
divide people who might otherwise find common cause in a shared economic 
or political situation.
A popular graphic seen on t-shirts and bumper stickers is the word coexist, 
with Christian, Jewish, and Islamic symbols standing in for certain letters. 
The suggestion is one that it’s hard to argue with: that people of different 
faiths should learn to get along and tolerate the differences among them-
selves. It’s a noble goal, and one that many people are successfully working 
towards every day — but sociologists of religion understand that it’s not 
always that easy.

Religious traditions do include distinctive symbols and styles of dress, but a 
religion isn’t just a hijab or a turban or a skullcap, it’s an entire philosophy 
about the fundamental nature of reality. Your religious affiliation is a social 
status like your race or your sex or your class, but it’s different than any of 
those because it corresponds to a whole set of values and beliefs that you 
may believe are dictated or influenced by a force higher, more powerful, and 
more important than any human being or social institution. The fact that reli-
gious beliefs and practices are almost always intertwined with ethnic tradi-
tions and family ties makes them even more profoundly important.
From this perspective, it may be disappointing that religious differences are 
behind some of today’s most bitter, brutal conflicts — but it shouldn’t be a 
surprise. Religion is, as it has always been, a deeply important part of peo-
ple’s social lives. Managing the transition to a society of increasingly diverse 
religious beliefs, for all its obvious benefits, is not an easy thing to do.
Religion: The remix
Over time, religious life changes in many ways. 
There’s change in the extent of people’s religi-
osity, in the distribution of religious beliefs, and 
in the beliefs and practices of particular faiths. 
Another way that religious life changes — and, 
like almost all forms of social change, it’s hap-
pening more quickly now than ever before — is 
in the way that religious traditions interact with 
and influence one another.
Anthropologists and historians have traced the 
tremendous spread, change, fragmenting, and 
consolidation of religious traditions. Christianity, 
Judaism, and Islam are today regarded as 
three different faiths, but they share common 
roots — and within each of those faiths, there 
are any number of different divisions. Among 
Christians alone, there are the Catholics, the 
Eastern Orthodox Catholics, the Lutherans, the 
Methodists, the Baptists, the Mennonites . . . 
the list goes on.
Besides the fragmentation of religious tradi-
tions into new and separate faiths, there are 
new faiths that are created by the intermixing 
of different traditions. Haitian voudou incorpo-
rates elements of European Christianity with 
elements of the beliefs and practices immi-
grants brought to Haiti by African immigrants. 
The Liberal Catholic Church blends Catholic 
theology with the insights of mystics and seers. 
One branch of Judaism unites the traditions and 
practices of that faith with the secular philoso-
phy of Humanism; another, “Jews for Jesus,” 
blends Jewish cultural and religious traditions 
with Christian beliefs.
This intermixing happens as people seek to find 
or create religious practices that both soothe 
their souls and speak to the circumstances of 
their lives. When couples from different tradi-
tions marry, they may blend their beliefs in their 
family lives — perhaps lighting the Menorah 
and plugging in the Christmas tree. Religious 
change is not just something decided by groups 
of spiritual leaders meeting in solemn congress; 
it’s something that happens in every city, in 
every country, every day.

Crime and Deviance: I Fought 
the Law . . . and I Won!
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the difference between deviance and crime
▶ Figuring out why criminals commit crimes
▶ Constructing crime on the streets and in the courts
▶ Becoming deviant
▶ Fighting crime
C
rime has always been a subject of intense interest for sociologists. On 
the one hand, it’s obviously a very practical thing to understand. There 
aren’t many higher priorities for society than fighting crime, and any insights 
sociologists are able to contribute might help. For this reason, sociolo-
gists often receive funding to collaborate with other scholars and with law 
enforcement authorities to investigate why crime occurs and how it might be 
minimized or prevented.
On the other hand, though, crime is an interesting phenomenon for sociolo-
gists to study because it represents the absolute edge of what is socially 
acceptable. Societies may be incredibly diverse and tolerant of a wide range 
of behavior, but those behaviors defined as crimes are where societies draw 
a line in the sand and say you may not. Different societies draw that line in 
different places, and they have different strategies for keeping people from 
crossing it — as well as punishing them when they do. Understanding how 
and why those lines are drawn can tell you a lot about how a society works in 
general.
In this chapter, I look at how crime is defined and fought in society. First, I 
explain the difference between “deviance” and “crime”; then, I go through dif-
ferent explanations of why criminals commit crimes. I then explain how crime 
is defined — both in the courts and on the streets — and how societies today 
are fighting crime. Finally, I look at teenage drinking as a case study in crime.

All Crime is Deviance, but Not 
All Deviance is a Crime
Every social group has its norms. Some of those norms are informal, meaning 
rules that are not written down and not officially defined as rules. There’s no 
official agreement about what’s supposed to happen to you if you stray from 
these norms, but if you do, people will probably notice and might well punish 
you in one way or another for failing to heed them. Some examples of infor-
mal norms include:
 
✓ Having good manners, such as saying please and thank you, holding the 
door for others, not eating with your mouth open.
 
✓ Keeping secrets among friends.
 
✓ Dressing according to generally accepted standards when you’re inter-
acting with other people.
 
✓ Getting married in your twenties and having kids in your thirties.
 
✓ Walking on the right (or, in some places, left) side of the hallway.
When you violate any social norm, sociologists call it deviance. If you don’t 
behave in the way you’re expected to behave, you are acting in a deviant 
manner. That sounds harsh, but it’s okay — you’re a deviant, and so am I. No 
one person behaves in a manner exactly like they’re supposed to. Sometimes 
you feel bad about this (for example, if you’re rude to a friend), sometimes 
you feel proud of this (for example, if you violate a social norm against having 
friends who are gay), but deviance is just part of social life.
Deviance may have benefits. You may impress a fellow “deviant” (for exam-
ple, someone who agrees with you that a particular unusual style of dress is 
attractive), you may save time or money (for example, by waiting until the 
last second to merge on the freeway, saving you time but slowing everyone 
else down), and you may inspire social change (for example, a girl who tries 
out for a football team may make it easier for other girls who are interested 
in playing football).
It’s also apt to have costs, though. You will draw attention to yourself, and 
people may avoid you, make fun of you, or even attack you for being differ-
ent. Whether or not it’s worth it for you to deal with that depends on the 
benefits you expect to earn, and what you think of the norm itself. Everyone 
makes these calculations every day when they consider the social conse-
quences of their actions.
Some norms are stronger: these are called formal norms. These are norms 
that are publicly stated (usually put in writing), and that may have an offi-
cially determined consequence. Some examples of formal norms include:

193
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
 
✓ A family rule that you have to do your chores before going outside 
to play.
 
✓ A school rule that students have to wear a certain uniform.
 
✓ A company policy that you need to ask your supervisor before schedul-
ing a vacation.
 
✓ A state law that you can’t exceed posted speed limits on the highway.
When formal norms are made by units of government and backed with the 
threat of force, they’re called laws. Breaking a law is deviant — and it’s also 
a crime.
 
Because crime is just a specific type of social deviance, everything that’s true 
of deviance is also true of crime. There may be benefits to crime (money, 
power, thrills), but there are also obviously costs — costs that may include 
fines, imprisonment, or even death. What’s important to understand is that 
crime is just one particular subset of deviance. What counts as “deviant” may 
vary from one social group to another, and within that general category of 
deviance, what counts as a “crime” is something that has to be sorted out by 
government agencies. Those decisions are what distinguishes deviance from 
crime, and deviants from criminals.
Criminals in Society
So who are these criminals? Why do people commit crimes? In his book 
Sociological Insight, Randall Collins looks at different reasons why a person 
might think criminals fall on the wrong side of the law; in this section, I dis-
cuss the two main theories Collins offers — they’re just bad people, and 
they’re driven to it — before explaining why sociologists think some crime is 
simply normal.
Some criminals are just 
bad people (but . . . )
When you see the word “criminal,” the images that may come to mind are 
pictures of brutal men and women: cold-blooded murderers, street thugs, 
and furtive child molesters. When these crimes come to light, the perpetra-
tors don’t look good. In fact, they often look downright evil. Their grainy 
mug shots are put on TV next to the smiling faces of their innocent victims, 
and the news anchors somberly tell viewers about their horrible crimes. Are 
people like this just plain evil? Isn’t that why people are criminals — there’s 
just something wrong with them?

194
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
There’s no doubt that in many cases, there’s something deeply wrong with 
people who commit serious crimes. They may have severe psychological 
disorders, or just a flat lack of regard for the feelings of others. It’s hard to 
explain their actions any other way.
But that can’t possibly work as a satisfactory explanation for all crimes. Of 
course people choose their actions freely and must be held accountable 
for their decisions, but it’s just too simple to say that all criminals are bad 
people — period, end of story.
For one thing, there is a wide range of crimes, from those that involve griev-
ous harm to others (murder, rape, assault) to those that involve milder forms 
of harm (theft, libel, disturbing the peace) to “victimless crimes” that involve 
harm, if any, only to oneself — illegal drug use, or failing to fasten one’s own 
seatbelt. A murderer may be a “bad person,” but is someone who plays his 
stereo too loud also a “bad person”? Is someone who smokes marijuana in 
a place where it’s illegal a “bad person”? There are many different kinds of 
crimes with many different consequences and motivations, and it’s clearly 
too simplistic to say that there is a single psychological or moral factor that 
binds all people defined as criminals.
Further, crimes are committed in different circumstances. Some people 
murder in self-defense whereas some murder in cold blood. Some people 
steal to feed their families whereas others steal to feed their taste for expen-
sive clothes. In neighborhoods where government-appointed law enforce-
ment officers are corrupt or unfair, can a person be blamed for throwing their 
lot in with a street gang? Social and political revolutionaries such as George 
Washington and Harriet Tubman were technically criminals in the eyes of the 
appointed authorities — were they fundamentally bad people? 
Though it is certainly the case that many criminals can be fairly judged to be 
sick or immoral, sociologists don’t believe that black-and-white moral judg-
ment is the best way to understand why and when people commit crimes. 
The world just isn’t that simple, and the law just isn’t that infallible.
Some criminals are “driven 
to it” (but . . . )
If it’s not adequate to understand crime simply in moral terms (criminals are 
bad, law-abiding citizens are good), then maybe it makes more sense to think 
about it in rational terms. That is, maybe the best way to think about crime 
is as something people are forced into. Setting aside the people who choose 
to commit crimes because they have a psychological disorder or have com-
pletely renounced any sense of obligation to others, maybe the rest of the 
criminals are reluctant ones. They don’t want to be criminals, but for some 
reason or other they’re forced to be.

195
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
Certainly, this describes a large proportion of criminals. It would have been 
very convenient for George Washington if Britain had recognized America’s 
sovereignty and the American Revolution hadn’t had to be fought, and 
beyond question Harriet Tubman would have rejoiced if the government 
Washington helped to found had in turn outlawed slavery rather than forcing 
her to conspire with fellow abolitionists in the creation of an Underground 
Railroad. Kids who join gangs to get the protection law enforcement can’t 
offer them, or people who steal to feed their families when they can’t find 
work to earn a proper living are clearly reluctant criminals.
This is a rational choice view of crime (see Chapter 6): It assumes that 
people weigh the costs and benefits of every action they take, and if they 
make the choice to commit a crime it must be because they’ve decided that 
the benefits of crime outweigh the risks or consequences. Rational choice 
explanations are popular among economists, and in fact there have been 
many economic studies of crime demonstrating that “criminal” acts and 
transactions — from drug trafficking to prostitution — are an important 
part of the global economy.
Even people working at legal jobs are not infrequently on the wrong side 
of the law; millions of immigrants are working without legal permission in 
countries around the world, an arrangement that technically makes them 
criminals but in which they participate because the pay and employment 
prospects in their native countries are often very limited, and because jobs 
are available with employers who benefit from the relatively cheap labor. A 
person who generally respects the rule of law may still choose to break spe-
cific laws because their circumstances otherwise would be dire.
This explanation, though helpful, is also incomplete. In most cases, com-
mitting a crime somehow makes sense to the criminal — that is, it’s not 
completely irrational or illogical — but it’s hard to understand why people 
feel “driven to” break the law in very different circumstances. Some people 
will die of starvation before they’ll steal, whereas other people are fabu-
lously wealthy and still embezzle money from their companies. Other people 
commit crimes where they don’t stand to make any personal gain: vandalism 
or assault. To say that crime is something criminals are “forced into” is some-
thing that is accurate in many cases — and feels accurate to the criminals in 
many more cases — but leaves a lot of crimes unexplained.
Some crime is simply normal
Some criminals are just bad people . . . that’s hard to argue with. Many crimi-
nals feel driven to it . . . yes, absolutely. But neither of those explanations is 
really a satisfactory explanation for all the various crimes committed in every 
society, everywhere, since the beginning of history.

196
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Emile Durkheim, as I explain in Chapter 3, believed in the survival of the 
fittest societies; as among plants and animals, he said, if a given feature is 
observed in many societies across a range of situations, there must be a 
reason for it. It must serve some kind of function for society, or at least be a 
necessary byproduct of some other function.
 
Crime occurs, without exception, in every society. Hence, Durkheim argued, it 
makes sense to see crime as normal. It’s just going to be there, whether you 
like it or not. Further, crime may actually be useful to a society. In this section, 
I first explain why crime is virtually inevitable, and possibly even useful.
Crime is inevitable
To call something “normal” isn’t necessarily to call it good, or nice. It’s 
normal for people to accidentally stub their toes every now and then; it’s 
normal for hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis to occur; and it’s normal 
for some people to step outside the bounds drawn by their society. Even 
in a community of saints living in a monastery, said Durkheim, there will 
be laws — and even in that community, every once in a while someone will 
break a law. That might mean a very minor offense — say, being late for 
prayers or letting a few weeds grow in the garden — but nonetheless, it will 
count as a “crime” in that particular society.
The whole point of laws, after all, is to force people to not do something that 
they may otherwise be tempted to do. It would obviously be a serious prob-
lem if every single person in a country decided to take one particular day off 
work, but there are no laws forcing people not to all take the same day off 
because it’s so extremely unlikely that it would occur. It’s much more likely 
that someone would cheat on their taxes, so there are laws against that.
At the same time, laws are written to cover situations where there is actually 
some chance where the laws will be enforced. It would be nice if everyone in 
a country said “please” and “thank you” at the dinner table, but cops have 
more important things to worry about than enforcing table manners . . . so 
there are no laws against simple rudeness.
Because laws are written to apply in situations where people are likely to 
break them, it’s more or less guaranteed that any given law will be broken 
sometimes — which means that it’s almost guaranteed that a society will 
have “criminals.” It’s not necessarily guaranteed that a society will have 
murderers or embezzlers (think of Durkheim’s hypothetical community of 
saints), but it is hard to imagine a society with no crime whatsoever.
Crime is useful
Saying that crime is normal may seem to imply that there’s no point in having 
law enforcement. If crime can’t be eliminated, if crime is inevitable, why 
bother hiring police officers?

197
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
Well, for one thing, enforcing laws does make it less likely that those par-
ticular laws will be broken. The police can’t completely eliminate fraud, but 
enforcing fraud deters at least some potential con artists from practicing 
their devious craft. If there’s a behavior that people in a society want there 
to be less of, putting cops on the case is a good idea even if they can’t stop 
every single criminal.
For another thing, though, enforcing crime may actually have benefits for 
the rest of society. Besides the fact that everyone else sees the law upheld 
and is taught to think twice before breaking the law themselves, the enforce-
ment of laws can be something that brings people together. Being united in 
disapproval, after all, is still being united. Whether it’s petty crime in a neigh-
borhood or sensational crime that makes national headlines, crime gives 
everyone something to talk about and to agree on. In effect, monitoring and 
supporting law enforcement is part of mainstream culture, and like all main-
stream culture (see Chapter 5), it can create a common denominator that 
unites even people who are very different.
 
In ancient Rome, crowds would fill the Coliseum to watch criminals be thrown 
to the lions; in medieval society, public hangings were popular entertainment. 
Societies today are a little more delicate than that, but spectacular criminal 
trials can still draw attention across a country — even around the world. 
The Social Construction of Crime
Although some crimes (for example, kidnapping) are very widely outlawed 
and others (for example, pumping your own gas) are outlawed only in a few 
places, all crime is socially constructed in that each society has to decide 
for itself what counts as a “crime.” In this section, I explain how crime is con-
structed in two places: in the courts and on the streets.
In the courts
In 1692, over two dozen people in Salem, Massachusetts were executed, or 
died in prison, as part of a series of events that became known as the Salem 
Witch Trials. Men and women were convicted of witchcraft based on confes-
sions forced through means like being pressed by rocks, and by the highly 
dubious testimony of neighbors — sometimes neighbors with a grudge to 
bear — who said that they had been haunted or cursed by the accused.
It’s one of the most shocking episodes in American history, and it’s been 
widely studied and discussed; Salem itself remains a popular destination, 
especially around Halloween, for tourists curious to see the town where the 
trials took place.

198
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
Many accounts portray the witch trials as a sort of inexplicable craze that 
overtook an otherwise normal town, but sociologist Kai Erikson wrote an 
entire book (Wayward Puritans: A Study in the Sociology of Deviance) explain-
ing why the trials, though tragic, make sense in social context. Seventeenth-
century New England Puritans were God-fearing people who sincerely 
believed that the Devil was at work on Earth in very concrete ways and that 
the courts were an appropriate place for his deeds to be exposed and pun-
ished. What’s more, their legal system gave individual judges tremendous 
leeway in interpreting and enforcing the law.
By contrast, in U.S. law today, not only is it illegitimate to prosecute super-
natural crimes, a much higher standard of evidence is required for criminal 
convictions — particularly where capital punishment is a possibility — and 
the jury system makes it harder for any one judge to go on a personal cru-
sade. Today, an event like the Salem Witch Trials is almost unthinkable; 
although it was exceptional even in colonial America, the legal system at that 
time was constructed such that an event like it may have been a very real 
possibility in any number of communities.
Erikson’s study provides a good, if extreme, example of how crimes are con-
structed in the courts and in the legislatures. An activity — witchcraft — that 
most Americans today don’t even believe is possible was genuinely feared 
in colonial America, and it was considered the proper business of the courts 
to stamp it out. In every society, laws are made and ruled upon in organiza-
tions (for example, courts and legislatures) that have the often-difficult task 
of deciding where to draw the line between behavior that ought to be punish-
able and behavior that ought not.
What counts as a “crime” varies from year to year — even day to day — as 
societies officially change their minds and change their laws. Here are just a 
few examples of debates that are taking place in societies today:
 
✓ Should abortion be legal, or illegal?
 
✓ Should it be legal or illegal to drive a car, or run a factory, that pollutes 
the atmosphere?
 
✓ Should it be legal or illegal to use portions of copyrighted material 
in recordings you create and then sell? If legal, how large a portion 
should you be allowed to use?
Legislatures in countries around the world might decide either way on any 
of these questions. If they decide one way, the activity in question becomes 
a crime, and those who engage in it are subject to punishment. If they decide 
the other way, the activity becomes as unpunishable as witchcraft.
Complicating matters even further is the fact that no law is completely unam-
biguous; it’s up to courts to decide whether the law applies in any given situ-
ation. Often this is simply a matter of establishing whether or not a violation 

199
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
of the law occurred (did the suspect, in fact, steal that car?), but in other 
cases courts need to take highly ambiguous laws and decide how to fairly 
enforce them according to appropriate social standards.
In Minneapolis, for example, the city where I live, there is a law against 
keeping as pets animals that are “wild by nature.” Clearly this means that 
keeping a hippo in the house is a no-no, but I could walk into any pet store 
and buy a parrot. Are parrots somehow, by nature, domestic? What about a 
turtle, or a fish?
As it happens, the law was intentionally written to be ambiguous, so that 
courts could have leeway to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the keep-
ing of a particular animal is inappropriate. The neighboring city of St. Paul, 
meanwhile, decided to take action to prevent what its city council saw as a 
potentially dangerous fad, and explicitly outlawed the keeping of sugar gliders.
If you had confessed to witchcraft in Massachusetts four hundred years ago, 
you might have been put to death. Today, proudly self-described witches run 
souvenir shops there. If I had a sugar glider in my pocket right now, sitting in 
Minneapolis, I’d be a law-abiding citizen . . . but if I were to take my pet across 
the Mississippi River to St. Paul, I’d be a criminal. “Crime” is what people say 
it is — nothing more and nothing less.
On the streets
Police officers are on the front lines of the fight against crime, and their 
heroic efforts — often in the line of serious danger — keep citizens safe every 
day. But how do they decide how best to keep people safe: which laws to 
enforce, and when, and how? It’s not always obvious.
Sometimes it’s clear what cops have to do. They may come across a theft in 
progress, or witness an egregious violation of someone’s rights, or be called 
to an urgent situation that demands immediate action. Often, though, police 
officers have a great deal of leeway in deciding when, where, and how to 
enforce the law.
Even in well-policed societies, it’s impossible to enforce every law. For 
example:
 
✓ On the freeway, people routinely exceed posted speed limits by modest 
margins, gambling that as long as they don’t push the envelope too far, 
the police won’t ticket them.
 
✓ Most jaywalkers would be shocked to be stopped by a cop.
 
✓ Large numbers of people break copyright laws every day by burning CDs 
or sharing music online.

200
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
 
✓ Marijuana is widely — often openly — used in countries where it’s offi-
cially illegal.
 
✓ Few people reach legal drinking age without ever having known the taste 
of alcohol, and at college campuses across the United States drinking 
is a primary social activity despite being nominally illegal for the large 
majority of undergraduate students.
As with the “exotic animal” law I mention earlier, some of the laws prohibit-
ing these activities were written with the full understanding that they would 
be unenforceable in most cases; they’re there to be selectively enforced, at 
the discretion of the law enforcement officers and the courts.
Other laws, though — for example, laws against murder, rape, violent assault, 
and large-scale theft — are written to be enforced as universally as possible, 
and possible violations can merit exhaustive investigations. On the streets, 
police officers need to decide how to divide their time and attention so as to 
prevent the worst crimes and prevent as many lesser crimes as possible.
This adds another level to the social construction of crime. The first level 
takes place in legislatures and courtrooms, and the second level takes place 
on the streets. If I know I’m not going to be caught at a crime, it de facto 
becomes not a crime at all.
 
In legal and academic use, the term de jure means “officially,” and the con-
trasting term de facto means “in reality.” In many cities, riding a bicycle on the 
sidewalk is de jure a crime (insofar as there are laws against it) but de facto 
legal (insofar as you’re unlikely to pay any penalty for it).
It’s clearly necessary for police officers to have this flexibility, but it creates 
the possibility for unfairness. For example, many women believe that male 
police officers will be less likely to give them speeding tickets if the women 
cry when they’re pulled over. Even if this isn’t true, it’s reasonable to think 
that it might be!
More troublingly, some police officers discriminate by race when deciding 
which possible crimes (or crimes in the making) to pursue. A song by the 
group Spearhead says that “it’s a crime to be black in America”; the truth 
behind the lyric is that in many neighborhoods, racial minorities are viewed 
with suspicion and are apt to get away with a lot less than whites. Despite 
concerted efforts by political and law enforcement leaders, discrimination 
in law enforcement is not apt to go away any time soon — no sooner than 
racism generally is apt to disappear. People dressing a certain way, or having 
a certain color of skin at the wrong place in the wrong time, unfairly risk mis-
treatment or undue suspicion.
The bottom line: “crime” is defined in legislatures, in courts, and on the 
streets.

Becoming Deviant
Like all sociologists, those who study crime and deviance have come to 
appreciate the wisdom of W.I. Thomas’s dictum that a situation defined as 
real is real in its consequences. In this case, that means that someone defined 
as “deviant” is especially likely to become even more deviant. 
In the 1970s, sociologist Robert W. Balch asked junior high students to imag-
ine a boy being caught outside of class without a hall pass — a violation of 
school rules, but a fairly minor one that could easily be overlooked. Balch 
asked the students to guess how a teacher would treat the boy if he were 
considered any of several things including a “troublemaker,” a “good quiet 
student,” or a “hippie.”
Unsurprisingly, the students overwhelmingly guessed that teachers would 
be especially hard on a “troublemaker” or a “hippie,” and especially easy on 
a “good quiet student.” In fact, they guessed that teachers would be harder 
on a reputed troublemaker who’d never actually broken the law than on a 
Don’t touch that file
Minnesota mom Jammie Thomas, like millions 
of Americans, used file-sharing software to 
exchange music over the Internet — an activ-
ity that’s illegal in the United States when it 
involves copyrighted files, as almost all popu-
lar music files are. The Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA) detected 
Thomas’s activity and asked her for a cash 
settlement in exchange for an agreement not to 
prosecute. Thomas refused, and the RIAA took 
her to court. When she was found guilty and 
fined $220,000, Thomas appealed the decision 
on the basis that the penalty was excessive. 
Instead of being overturned, the judgment was 
increased — to almost two million dollars.
Thomas’s lawyers called the penalty “grossly 
excessive,” and many Americans were inclined 
to agree. Even people who acknowledge the 
necessity of copyright law question whether 
individuals who share music with no inten-
tion to profit by it deserve to be held liable for 
monetary damages — much less multi-million-
dollar damages. The RIAA stood by its decision 
to prosecute Thomas, saying that the recording 
industry was losing much more than two mil-
lion dollars each year because people would 
illegally download songs rather than paying for 
them, and that just because the law couldn’t be 
enforced in every instance didn’t mean it was 
wrong to enforce it in any particular instance.
The Thomas case and the international discus-
sion about it show that people know the law is 
a blunt instrument and that “crime” is what you 
get caught for doing. Essentially, some people 
claimed, fining Thomas two million dollars for 
sharing a couple dozen songs was like fining 
someone two million dollars for driving five miles 
per hour over the speed limit. It was unfair, they 
said, to so strictly enforce a law that millions of 
people reasonably assume every day that they 
can get away with breaking. Is it? The courts 
said no, but you may have another opinion.

student who had been in trouble with the police outside of school but man-
aged to “keep his nose clean” at school. In effect, they told Balch that the way 
a situation was defined — whether or not a boy was a troublemaker — was 
more important than the actual truth of the situation, whether or not the boy 
had committed a serious offense.
What’s especially sobering about Balch’s study is that it’s easy to imagine a 
boy being labeled a “troublemaker” for actually causing trouble, but it’s also 
easy to imagine someone being considered “trouble” simply because of his 
race (for example, being black in a majority-white school), his economic situ-
ation (for example, being a working-class student in an upper-class school), 
or his sex (just being a boy rather than a girl). In any of those situations, you 
might come to feel like you can’t win.
Being labeled deviant, then, can actually cause deviance in two ways:
 
✓ It can cause you to be apprehended and punished for behavior that 
someone without that label would have gotten away with — for example, 
being outside of class without a hall pass, or driving at night with a 
broken headlight. That adds to your disciplinary record and essentially 
makes you “more deviant” than the people who did the exact same thing 
but got away with it.
 
✓ It can make you more likely than someone without that label to actually 
decide to be deviant because you’re in a different set of circumstances. 
If you figure you’re going to get in trouble whether or not you obey the 
rules, why bother obeying them?
The irony is that slapping someone with a “deviant” label is often intended 
to shame them into reforming whatever behavior caused a social group or 
authority figure to define them as deviant in the first place. In the circum-
stances mentioned earlier, being called “deviant” is unfair in the sense that 
it doesn’t necessarily correspond to any actual deviant behavior — but of 
course, often it does.
A kid in school may actually have caused some trouble, and a man or woman 
on the streets may in fact have committed a serious crime. In those cases, 
calling them “deviant” — an “ex-con” or a “repeat offender” — is perfectly 
fair in the sense that it actually does describe their behavior. For that reason, 
it’s not illogical or unreasonable for teachers, police, and other authorities to 
pay attention to that label. If a boy caused trouble once, it only makes sense 
to think he may be tempted to cause trouble again.
Still, the fact that “deviant” labels can have such serious consequences 
means that anyone concerned with fairness ought to be concerned with 
applying them, and with jumping to conclusions about someone’s behavior 
based on any label they may have. This has implications for fighting crime 
and deviance — as I explain next.

 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
Fighting Crime
Just because the idea of “crime” is socially constructed doesn’t mean that 
crime is okay, or that crime is nothing to be worried about. What counts as 
“clean” is socially constructed too, but that doesn’t mean you never need to 
shower! One of the reasons sociologists have spent so much time studying 
crime is to help understand why crime occurs and to give law enforcement 
officers tools to fight it. In this section, I explain how sociology can be used 
to help prevent crime — as well as to figure out what to do when people do 
commit crimes.
What works, and what doesn’t
In 1997, a teenager named Michael Carneal opened fire at his school in 
Paducah, Kentucky, killing three students and injuring five others. People in 
the community said they had absolutely no warning — but was that true? All 
these things were known about Carneal before the shooting occurred:
His school work was sloppy, and his grades had recently dipped. He had 
stolen from and vandalized his school.
He was routinely subject to public humiliation, he had poor social skills, 
and he was a prankster who had thrown a stink bomb at school.
He had been caught looking at pornography on a school computer; in 
fact, he sold pornography to other students.
He had abnormal fears, and he had written disturbing essays.
He was brutal to animals, he had plastic weapons confiscated from him, 
and had brought two actual guns to school. He stole guns and money 
and kept rifles at a friend’s house, he threatened his peers and physically 
hurt at least one classmate, and he openly fantasized about taking over 
the mall and the school. He threw a bike in a bonfire, owned a copy of the 
Anarchist’s Cookbook, shot a cow, and spoke about solving problems with 
extreme violence.
Anyone in the community would have done anything to prevent the tragic 
shooting, and yet no one had been able to put together the pieces and pre-
vent the crime. Why not? In the early 2000s, the U.S. Congress asked sociolo-
gist Katherine Newman to investigate why school shootings occurred and 
how they might be prevented. 
With psychologists already investigating the problem of school shootings, 
Congress approached a sociologist because they understood that preventing 
crime is about more than just understanding “the criminal mind.” There’s no 
doubt that it’s important to understand the psychological state of those who 

204
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
commit crimes — especially violent crimes — but law enforcement officials 
can’t get inside the heads of all possible criminals, and they can’t solve every-
one’s problems. What government agencies, schools, companies, and even 
families can do is to build social structures that help detect and deter crimes 
before they happen, as well as help to apprehend suspects after crimes have 
been committed.
A sociologically informed approach to fighting crime will focus not on the 
individual criminals but on the circumstances in which crimes are commit-
ted. A couple of important sociological insights into crime appear elsewhere 
in this book: Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush’s finding that fixing 
broken windows isn’t the best use of police officers’ time because people’s 
perceptions of disorder have more to do with the people around them than 
with their physical surroundings (Chapter 2), and Christopher Winship’s 
study of how a partnership between the Boston Police and black religious 
leaders helped to dramatically lower the rate of violent crime in Boston 
(Chapter 10).
Those sociological studies and others (also see Chapter 14) have shown that 
crime fighting shouldn’t just be treated like a game of whack-a-mole, with 
police officers running to take care of whatever problems happen to arise. 
Of course they have to do a lot of that, but to only do that is to buy into the 
theory that criminals are “bad people” who just happen to be that way. If that 
were the only explanation for crime, then crime would be very difficult to 
predict — bad people can be anywhere.
It’s also not enough to just keep tabs on the people who seem to have the 
strongest motives to commit crimes. That approach can lead to heavy-
handed policing of low-income communities, possibly fraying relationships 
between citizens and cops, and ironically leading to even more crime. If 
understanding and fighting crime was as simple as figuring out which people 
might have motives to commit crimes, cops’ jobs would be much easier and 
detective novels would be much more boring.
Sociologists emphasize that crimes take place in a social context, and a good 
way to prevent and detect those crimes is to help build a social context that 
makes crime difficult to get away with. When the Boston Police partnered 
with ministers in the community, they built a trusting relationship with allies 
who shared their interest in preventing violent crime and could help share 
influence and information.
So how can all this help prevent school violence? Newman’s study produced 
a book-length report, Rampage, that she wrote with several colleagues; it 
contains detailed analyses of multiple school shootings and makes concrete 
recommendations that every school can learn from, drawing insights from 
microsociology (see Chapter 6), network analysis (Chapter 7), and the sociol-
ogy of organizations (Chapter 12).

205
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
The way I opened this section was, intentionally, a little misleading — I men-
tioned a number of things that were known about Michael Carneal. But by 
whom were they known? No one person, it turns out, knew all of those things, 
or even most of them. All of those facts emerged after the shooting, when 
authorities, journalists, and scholars investigating the case talked to every-
one who had any contact with Carneal. All those warning signs were known, 
but no one individual saw the whole picture. Think about how insights from 
these sociological perspectives might help administrators understand and 
prevent school violence:
 
✓ Microsociology. Many people who knew Carneal were surprised to hear 
of the shooting because they couldn’t believe the Michael Carneal they 
knew would be the type of person to commit such a horrible act of vio-
lence. Erving Goffman, though, clearly points out that people can wear 
very different masks to different people. The “real Michael” wasn’t the 
Michael his teachers saw, or the Michael his classmates saw, or even the 
Michael his best friends saw. The “real Michael” was all of those people, 
and it’s important to remember that you can’t count on any one indi-
vidual to really know what a potential criminal is capable of. You have to 
combine multiple reports.
 
✓ Network analysis. It may seem surprising that so many school shootings 
occur in close-knit rural or suburban communities, rather than in the 
supposedly impersonal big cities — but being a part of a tight social net-
work with many overlapping ties also means that there’s no escape from 
uncomfortable social situations. If you’re teased at school in the big city, 
you might go home to a completely different neighborhood with people 
who think of you differently, but in a small town, you’re trapped.
 
✓ Organizational analysis. Sociologists who have studied organizations 
also understand that a dense network of social ties doesn’t necessarily 
translate into a free flow of information. People may keep information 
to themselves because of personal animosities, a fear of being embar-
rassed, or a fear of being seen as a gossip. Sometimes there are impor-
tant things that, whether for good reasons or not, you don’t tell even 
your closest friends and coworkers. 
One of Newman’s recommendations was that schools open channels of com-
munication, especially for potential warning signs, so that someone like a 
school counselor might have the information they need to appreciate which 
students are at risk of committing violent acts. Violent acts like homicide and 
suicide rarely take place without warning; the trick is seeing, and responding 
to, the signs.
 
As ads on the New York subway put it, “If you see something, say something.” 
If you have any indication that a person you know is at risk of harming them-
selves or others, talk about your concerns with a trusted authority figure or a 
mutual friend. There may be other warning signs that you’re not aware of, and 
sharing information may lead to someone intervening before it’s too late.

America’s high incarceration rate
What to do when crimes are committed? There’s no easy answer to that ques-
tion either, but again, sociology can lend helpful insight to decision-making 
authorities. The remarkably high incarceration rate in the United States 
today is a subject of much discussion by sociologists and criminologists, and 
by the end of this section it should be clear why.
In general, when a society catches someone having committed a crime, it doles 
out consequences. There are at least three reasons for this. (See the end of this 
section for a mention of incarceration as “eye for an eye” retribution.)
Cars, crime, and kickbacks
In the 1970s, sociologist Harvey A. Farberman 
set out to study the market for used cars. He 
didn’t expect it to be a study of crime — he 
wanted to conduct a microsociological study 
of how potential buyers interacted with car 
salesmen. He soon realized, though, that he’d 
stumbled upon a fascinating case study in the 
sociology of crime: a social situation where 
criminal behavior was all but guaranteed by the 
rules of the game.
In the car business — at least, at that time — 
the rules of the game were set by the car manu-
facturers. They had the power to license deal-
ers and to determine how much inventory those 
dealers were forced to keep on hand. If a manu-
facturer decided that a given dealer would take 
on a certain number of cars to sell, that was 
that; if the dealer didn’t have the money to pay 
upfront for the inventory, the dealer would have 
to borrow it with interest. Further, the profit to 
be made on each new car sale was very thin.
So how did dealers stay in business? They 
exploited their customers through fraudulent 
service and repair practices — overcharging 
customers for repairs and doing unnecessary 
repairs for large sums — and they exploited 
used-car wholesalers by demanding cash 
bribes on top of used car trade-ins they sold 
to the wholesalers for resale. That meant the 
wholesalers needed cash to pay the bribes, and 
they earned it by conspiring with their custom-
ers to defraud the government by receiving a 
portion of their payments in (untaxed) cash.
By the letter of the law, then, the car retail 
industry was absolutely packed with crimi-
nals. But, Farberman’s observations showed, 
if any individual dealership obeyed the law, it 
would go out of business; and if every dealer-
ship obeyed the law, the entire industry would 
collapse. In setting their prices and policies, 
argued Farberman, car manufacturers maxi-
mized their profits but essentially forced dealer-
ships into criminal practices. Farberman’s study 
provides an example of a social situation where 
fighting crime could not be a matter of simply 
arresting all the criminals; to end crime in the 
retail car market, the way that market operated 
would have to be fundamentally changed.

207
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
 
✓ Deterrence. It’s believed that if potential criminals know that it’s likely 
they’ll face punishment for committing a crime, they’ll be less likely 
to do so. The harsher the punishment, the greater the disincentive to 
commit the crime. In this way, people punished for committing crimes 
are serving as examples to others who might be tempted to follow the 
same path.
 
✓ Prevention. It’s impossible to predict with certainty who might commit 
a crime, but if someone is proven to have committed a previous crime, 
it’s thought to be a good bet that they’ll be tempted to commit the same 
crime again. Imprisoning criminals helps keep them from committing 
more crimes.
 
✓ Reformation. If a person commits a crime, there may be something that 
can be done — psychological therapy, for example, or job training — that 
can help change the circumstances that led the person to commit that 
crime. Convicted criminals can be forced, in prison or on probation, to 
undergo treatment that might make it less likely they will offend again.
Does punishment work? Does it help prevent crime? To some extent, abso-
lutely. The experience of societies in periods of lawlessness — say, due to 
natural disasters or civil war — shows that although most people can be 
counted on to behave responsibly, many will take advantage of the situation 
(and, therefore, take advantage of others). Obviously there are some people 
who are prone to commit terrible acts of violence, but many others will also 
commit petty thefts or otherwise behave selfishly in the absence of a rule of 
law. It’s clear that there needs to be some form of meaningful punishment to 
deter and prevent crime.
But how much, and what kind? That’s the hard question. Increasing penal-
ties deters crime to some extent, but not always predictably. A potential fine 
of two million dollars would seem to be enough to keep people from sharing 
a few songs, but millions of people are apparently unconcerned and do it 
anyway. (See sidebar, “Don’t touch that file.”) For four decades the American 
government has waged a “war on drugs,” dramatically increasing fines and 
prison sentences for drug-related crimes; it’s had so little success at actually 
reducing recreational drug use that President Barack Obama’s administration 
has decided to stop using the term “war on drugs” to describe America’s anti-
drug efforts.
Besides the fact that punishment doesn’t always work at preventing crime, 
there are two additional points to consider when thinking about how much 
punishment to dole out, and for what crimes.

208
Part III: Equality and Inequality in Our Diverse World 
First, there’s the fact that punishment is not free. Maintaining jails, prisons, 
and probation officers is a huge expense that normally must be borne by the 
innocent taxpayers who populate a society. They gain, of course, in being 
protected from the imprisoned offenders as well as by the fact that the pos-
sibility of being imprisoned helps to deter other potential offenders, but it’s 
reasonable to ask whether at some point there are declining returns to that 
investment. How many people must be imprisoned, and for how long, to keep 
a society reasonably safe? Money spent on prisons might also be spent on 
police officers, hospitals, or scientific research. What’s the best use of that 
money?
Also, incarceration can directly or indirectly cause crime. The theory is that 
prisons are places where offenders learn life skills and repent of their crimes, 
but often the reality is that prisons are places where convicts are under the 
negative influence (sometimes, the abuse) of other offenders, coming out 
more crime-prone than they were when they went in — plus, having a grudge 
to bear against the society that put them behind bars.
Sociologists have also paid close attention to the effect of stigma: a social 
label that causes others to think less of a person. Most employers, for most 
jobs, in most places, are allowed to investigate the criminal records of poten-
tial employees — not just determining whether a potential daycare employee 
is a convicted sex offender, but asking whether a potential grocery clerk or 
auto mechanic has ever been convicted of any crime whatsoever. A convict 
released from prison bears a very heavy stigma that may make it unusually 
difficult for them to find work or have healthy social relationships. Having 
been in prison gives a person a label of “deviant” (as explained earlier) that 
blazes like a neon sign, giving that person an uphill battle to earn trust and 
opportunities both in and out of the workplace.
The stigma of being an ex-prisoner can cause what sociologists call second-
ary deviance: crime or deviance that is a direct result of the primary deviance 
that first led the person afoul of the law. To some extent this is reasonable 
and unavoidable — who wouldn’t want to know if a potential employee had 
been in prison? — but it’s important to bear in mind when considering how 
many people to imprison, and for what crimes.
These debates are particularly relevant to the United States today because 
the “war on drugs” and other changes in U.S. law have led to an incarcera-
tion rate that’s significantly higher than that of other developed countries. 
To some extent that observation is neither here nor there because the United 
States may be unique — maybe Americans are especially crime-prone, or 
maybe there would be much more crime if there weren’t so many potential 
offenders in prison — but many sociologists and criminologists are con-
cerned, and they believe that changes in U.S. policy are overdue.

209
 Chapter 11: Crime and Deviance: I Fought the Law . . . and I Won!
Especially troubling to many is the fact that certain groups — especially 
African-American men — are vastly overrepresented in the U.S. prison popu-
lation. To the extent that imprisonment does have a negative effect on the 
imprisoned, minority communities are bearing the brunt of that negative 
effect. Whether that is appropriate and humane is a question people disagree 
on — after all, people usually aren’t imprisoned for nothing, and with a few 
exceptions, each individual in prison has in fact committed a serious crime — 
but sociologists insist it’s a question that needs to be looked at very closely.
 
Many people believe that crimes should be punished, if for no other reason, 
for the reason that it’s “only fair” — that is, that if someone hurts another 
person, the offender should have harm done to them in return. I don’t include 
this in the list of reasons for incarceration because it’s not an empirical argu-
ment: If you believe that people should be incarcerated in retribution for 
crimes, that is a moral belief, not an argument about how to reduce crime. (If 
you think that incarcerating criminals will make others hesitant to commit 
crimes, that would be considered a deterrence argument, as mentioned else-
where in this section.) Whether or not you believe criminals should be pun-
ished in retribution for their crimes is something you have to decide for 
yourself, not something a sociologist can decide for you.

f I asked you to name a society, you’d probably name a country — the 
society of Kenya, or the society of Vietnam, or the society of the United 
States. It’s true, those are all good examples of societies, but societies can 
also be smaller: a state or province, a family, and, of course, a corporation. 
(See Chapter 2 for more on what a “society” is.)
On a day-to-day basis, you may be more deeply involved in the society of 
your workplace or school than in any other society — including your own 
family! Corporations, schools, and other social organizations also occupy a 
lot of people’s attention because they’re consciously designed . . . and rede-
signed, and re-redesigned. Everyone wants to know what the best way is to 
organize a for-profit company or a nonprofit organization or a school or a 
religious organization so as to help that organization work as effectively and 
efficiently as possible, which also means keeping all of its members happy!
In this chapter, I explain how sociologists study and think about organiza-
tions such as these. I first introduce the general sociological approach to 
organizations, then explain how sociologists have come to appreciate that 
organizations are rational systems with purposes . . . but they aren’t always 
rational systems, and they don’t always stick to the same purpose. Of course, 
that might be something you don’t need a sociologist to tell you. 

214
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
The Corporate Conundrum: Making 
a Profit Isn’t as Easy — or as 
Simple — as it Sounds
Sociologists — working in collaboration with economists and other organiza-
tional analysts, for example those at business schools — want to understand 
how organizations work, and that means acknowledging the reality that 
people in organizations are facing complicated choices and great uncertainty, 
and that they’re working with limited time and information. Sometimes that 
means that they hit on brilliant insights, but sometimes it means that they 
crash and burn. Most organizations do some of each. For-profit corporations 
want to make profits, which seems like a pretty simple and straightforward 
task, but companies tie themselves in knots trying to accomplish it. New 
products, new advertising campaigns, mergers, acquisitions, executive 
retreats and skit nights…sometimes it seems like companies are running 
to stand still, or running and still managing to move backwards. “Making a 
profit” turns out to be a lot less simple than it sounds.
Take Starbucks, for example. The company’s official mission statement is “to 
inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup, and one neigh-
borhood at a time.” Could they be any more ambitious? What’s wrong with 
just selling coffee?
There’s nothing wrong with just selling coffee — but corporate life is rarely 
that simple. Imagine that you founded a competing company; one that did 
not aspire to “nurture the human spirit,” but just to sell coffee at a reason-
able profit. Seems straightforward . . . until you try to do it.
Where are you going to sell your coffee? Are you going to operate stores, 
or are you going to have a mail-order operation, or both? Are you going to 
sell brewed coffee, or just the beans? If you’re selling brewed coffee, are you 
also going to sell espresso drinks? Will you stock flavored syrups and three 
kinds of milk? What about hot chocolate? Tea? Snacks? You could reasonably 
extend your product line into all of these areas:
 
✓ Frozen drinks
 
✓ To-go drinks
 
✓ Drinks sold through grocery stores
 
✓ Coffee-flavored ice cream
 
✓ Coffee mugs
 
✓ Coffeemakers

215
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
 
✓ Stuffed animals wearing your corporate logo
 
✓ Music to listen to while drinking coffee
 
✓ Board games to play while drinking coffee
In fact, Starbucks sells all those things — and if you don’t, your customers 
may wonder why not.
Then, after you’ve decided on a product line and an expansion strategy, you 
need to put into place a team to manage your employees. At a basic level, 
you need to manage payroll and benefits; beyond that, you need to worry 
about hiring, firing, and promotion. And what about training? Then there’s 
the question of your corporate culture; you want to make your employees 
happy. Should you hold holiday parties or summer picnics? Maybe organize 
volunteer outings to help build playgrounds and clean up parks?
When you get that far, you’re going to be looking at questions of optimal 
organization and product flow. Are you going to own your stores, or fran-
chise them out? From whom are you going to buy your coffee, and how are 
you going to make sure they keep up with your demand at a price you can 
afford? Are you going to manufacture your own paper coffee cups, or are you 
going to hire another company to do that? If you’re facing competition from a 
smaller coffee company, should you try to buy that company?
 
At every level of organization, there are many, many difficult choices — and 
the bigger your organization gets, the more choices and possibilities you 
have. Starbucks’s mission statement does mention a “cup,” but fundamentally 
it allows the company to do anything that might be considered “nurturing the 
human spirit,” so long as that spirit nurturing turns a profit. That gives the 
company a lot of options, and potentially a lot of frustrations.
To begin understanding the sociological approach to organizations, in the 
next section I describe Max Weber’s classic theory of bureaucracy.
Weber’s Big Idea About Organizations
The great sociologist Max Weber, as I explain in Chapter 3, believed that over 
time, society has become more and more rational — that is, that society has 
become increasingly based on formal rules that are carefully planned and 
documented, are rigorously followed, and that apply to everyone regardless 
of who they are, where they come from, or what they believe.
Sound familiar? It might sound to you like the way things work at your 
school or workplace, where there are a million confusing rules and forms 
upon forms to fill out, and where it may seem like things would be so much 

216
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
easier if people would just focus on solving problems instead of nit-picking 
about every little thing. In one form or another, your school or workplace is 
a bureaucracy — and Weber believed that bureaucratic organization is one of 
the hallmarks of contemporary society.
Weber’s definition of a bureaucracy is in many ways the starting point for 
today’s sociology of organizations. According to Weber, bureaucracies have 
several key characteristics:
 
✓ A bureaucracy is an organization defined by written rules. A bureau-
cratic organization may have many different parts, but the relationships 
among those parts are defined in the rules — which also define the 
limits of the organization.
 
✓ Each person who works in a bureaucracy has a given set of responsibili-
ties, which they are expected to fulfill within prescribed limits.
 
✓ Positions in a bureaucracy are organized in a hierarchy, where it’s clear 
who has authority over whom.
 
✓ Bureaucracies hire and promote on the basis of formal credentials (like 
school degrees or professional certificates), training, and job perfor-
mance — not on the basis of personal preference or affinity.
 
✓ Everything a person in a bureaucracy needs to perform their job is sup-
plied to them by the organization — which, then, owns those supplies.
What this adds up to is that in a bureaucracy, a position is separated from 
the person in that position. The people in bureaucracies are essentially parts 
in a machine — and if a part in a machine breaks, it gets replaced by another 
part that’s going to do the exact same thing.
By contrast, think about a group of friends. A group of friends is a social orga-
nization, with members working together to achieve goals (throw a party, go 
out on the town, share information about other groups) — but it’s an infor-
mal organization, where who you are is intimately tied to what you do in that 
organization. Maybe you have an awesome home entertainment system for 
your friends to enjoy, but if for some reason you leave your group of friends, 
they don’t get to keep the entertainment system. You don’t leave an empty 
“position” in your group of friends; they may or may not bring in someone 
new, and if they do, that new person will have different possessions and 
qualities to bring to the group.
At a corporation, on the other hand, if you quit you don’t get to take your 
computer and your desk — those belong to the company, and they’ll be used 
by the person they hire to replace you, who will do more or less exactly the 
same thing you did. A company is a bureaucracy: a permanent, formal organi-
zation that follows a set of rules.

217
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
Because they’re so impersonal, bureaucracies can seem unfair, unkind, and 
bizarrely ineffective. (See sidebar, “Getting a leg up on bureaucracy.”) You 
may need something from a bureaucracy that seems simple and straightfor-
ward, but if the bureaucracy isn’t set up to do that, it’s not going to happen. 
Banks may refuse loans to good, reliable people because they don’t have 
any credit history; bars may refuse to admit a grey-haired senior citizen who 
doesn’t have a driver’s license to prove he’s over 21; and an ATM machine 
may eat your card because you accidentally mistype your security code.
There is, though, a reason that companies continue to organize themselves 
bureaucratically. Even if bureaucracies seem to be acting in an absurd 
manner, it may collectively benefit the entire company to set up firm rules 
and expectations from which employees are not allowed to deviate. 
Getting a leg up on bureaucracy
For my niece Madeline’s second birthday, my 
mom gave her a small table and chairs that 
came in a box sealed from the factory. When 
they opened the box to assemble the table, 
though, my mom and my sister discovered that 
the table had only three legs — clearly, there 
had been an error on the packing line and not 
all the parts had been included. Mom called the 
company and asked if they would please send 
a replacement leg so that the table would stand 
properly. No, she was told, she would need to 
pack the table back up and return the whole 
thing to the store, where it would be replaced 
with a complete table.
But, my mom said, it would be incredibly incon-
venient to do that — and anyway, she’d already 
thrown all the packing material away. Didn’t 
the company have a factory with thousands 
of little table legs? Couldn’t they just grab one 
and send it to her? No, she was told; that would 
be a “special order” that would take several 
weeks to fulfill and would cost almost as much 
as buying an entirely new table-and-chairs set.
Mom tried again: What if the company opened a 
box with a complete table and chairs, took a leg 
out of the box, and sent it to Mom? The result 
would be the exact same as if Mom returned 
her set: The factory would have a table without 
a leg, and Madeline would have a table with 
four legs. Nope, Mom was told. They couldn’t 
do that.
In the end, the company recognized how frus-
trated Mom was getting — and sent her an 
entirely new table and chairs, without making 
her return the one she had. Because of the 
company’s bureaucratic organization, it was 
easier for them to do that than to break the rules 
and open a sealed box or take a table leg off 
the assembly line. Sometimes, when sticking to 
their own rules, bureaucracies end up acting in 
a paradoxical, wasteful manner. Many compa-
nies consider it better to be a little wasteful than 
to allow employees to break any rules and risk 
the resulting disorganization and confusion.

A friend of mine was given a troubleshooting job at a top software company pre-
cisely because she didn’t have much experience with programming — the com-
pany had learned that when it hired technical whizzes for that troubleshooting 
position, the whizzes would come up with inventive solutions that no one else 
could understand, which made the software impossible for anyone else to fix 
when something else went wrong. The company just wanted someone who 
would follow the rules and do exactly as they were told in each given situation.
Furthermore, the fact that bureaucracies (officially, at least) don’t discriminate 
can be for the better. The fact that loans are now based on credit scores means 
that someone can’t be given a loan for being a “good guy,” but it also means 
that someone can’t be denied a loan because of their race or sex.
Still, being caught in a bureaucracy can seem uncomfortably impersonal — 
because, after all, it is. That’s why Weber called rationality an “iron cage.” 
(See Chapter 3 for more on Weber and his “iron cage.”)
Rational Systems: Bureaucracy 
at its Purest
One of the best sociological books on the subject of social organization is 
Richard W. Scott’s Organizations: Rational, Natural, and Open Systems. In the next 
three sections of this chapter, I borrow Scott’s insightful typology to discuss 
these three different ways that sociologists have come to understand organiza-
tions. Every organization is rational, natural, and open; I’ll explain what each of 
those terms mean, one by one. First, I describe “rational systems.”
 
In Scott’s typology, “rational,” “natural,” and “open” are three different ways to 
understand organizations, not three different kinds of organizations. Be careful 
not to be confused and think that some organizations are “rational,” others are 
“natural,” and still others are “open” — every organization has all of those 
qualities.
Measuring the shovels: Efficiency! 
Efficiency!
The term rational system refers to the fact that any organization is typically 
designed to work as efficiently as possible at accomplishing some set task. 
A bureaucracy as described by Weber (see previous section) is a classic 
rational system: an organization that works like a machine. In this sense, 
almost all formal organizations — that is, organizations with rules and 
defined membership — are rational systems. Just because they’re not always 

219
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
rational doesn’t mean they aren’t designed with a goal in mind, or that they 
don’t generally accomplish that goal in some form or to some extent.
An engineer-turned-management consultant named Frederick Taylor was the 
all-time greatest proponent of rational systems. He recognized that organiza-
tions weren’t always rational, but he thought that was a problem that ought 
to be fixed. In Chapter 3, I explain that the first sociologists believed that 
sociological research could help to design the ideal society; if we were to 
understand exactly how societies work, we could fix social problems like we 
repair cars and TVs. Taylor had exactly this view of organizations, and in the 
early 20th century he actually undertook to study particular organizations 
and help their owners or administrators make them work better.
Taylor’s approach became known as “scientific management” or “Taylorism.” 
He would visit organizations and study every detail of how they worked, 
then recommend how their operations could be revised to make them work 
better. He had four main principles:
 
✓ Instead of guessing at how to do a task most efficiently, study the task 
scientifically and choose the method proven to be most effective.
 
✓ Select employees based on precise qualifications, and train them in the 
most efficient work practices rather than leaving them to figure things 
out for themselves.
 
✓ Supervise workers closely, and retrain them when necessary.
 
✓ Give managers the job of designing efficient work methods and supervis-
ing the workers who actually accomplish the tasks.
Most famously, Taylor observed steel mills and offered recommendations as 
to how to improve every aspect of the steel production process — from the 
specific tasks each worker was given to the communication systems used in 
mills to the way the mill floor was laid out and the way material moved from 
one part of the mill to another. He even went so far as to study the size of 
shovels used by workers and determine what size shovel allowed a worker to 
scoop the most coal over the course of a workday.
Tensions between labor and management were high in Taylor’s time, and just as 
Comte believed that sociology could bring peace to society, Taylor believed that 
his version of scientific management could resolve labor disputes: If the ideal 
work conditions were determined by objective scientific observation rather than 
by the whims of managers, how could workers possibly argue with that?
Quite easily, as it turned out. Taylor appreciated the role of financial incen-
tives and argued that his system fairly compensated dedicated workers — he 
held up one particular steel worker, Schmidt, as an example, and pointed out 
that Schmidt was working more efficiently under Taylor’s system and making 
more money to boot. The steel company profited, and so did Schmidt . . . 
thus, scientific management was a win-win proposition.

220
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Many workers and labor advocates, though, saw Taylor’s methods as dehu-
manizing and brutal. In breaking down jobs into their individual components 
and telling each worker precisely how to do his job, his critics said, Taylor 
was taking away workers’ autonomy and making their work miserable. Plus, 
it seemed to assume they were too stupid to know how to do their own jobs. 
The famous muckraker Upton Sinclair pointed out that yes, Schmidt was 
making 61 percent more pay under Taylor’s system . . . but for doing 362 per-
cent more work. When workers at one Massachusetts plant were subjected 
to Taylor’s methods, they went on strike and inspired Congressional hearings 
where Taylor spent four days defending his methods.
Sociologists today agree that Taylor wasn’t fundamentally mistaken in his 
belief that evaluating work processes objectively, especially in situations 
where tasks are rote, is a better strategy for efficient production than allow-
ing each worker to independently create a work plan. Still, they also agree 
that Taylor made a basic error in thinking that it was a good idea to treat 
human workers like machines. 
 
Even when there’s fair pay for efficient work, people are not machines and 
they’re apt to balk when it seems like there’s no room for individuality, vari-
ety, or personal initiative in their work. Taylorism may not be wrong . . . but 
it’s not exactly right, either.
The bounds of reason
Taylor’s approach makes most sense when work is predictable and easily 
routinized — but of course, for many jobs that’s not the case. In many cases, 
organizations and the people who work for them have to deal with ambigu-
ous situations that change from week to week, day to day, or even moment 
to moment. In those situations, it’s just not reasonable to expect a worker to 
follow a strict set of rules. Workers have to be flexible and make decisions 
based on changing circumstances.
So what can you do if you want to make someone in a job like that as efficient 
as possible? Well, you can take a few actions:
 
✓ You can equip them with general principles about what decisions to 
make in which circumstances. For example, you might tell a manager 
not to give any customers special accommodations unless it seems like 
they’re about to switch their business to another company.
 
✓ You can try to localize the decision-making, so that the same people 
make the same kinds of decisions. For example, many stores have des-
ignated returns departments with people who are specially trained to 
accept returns — so busy cashiers don’t have to make decisions about 
whether or not to accept returns.
 
✓ You can have people work in teams to make complex decisions, so no 
one worker is given all the decision-making power.

221
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
Even so, dealing with uncertainty is a major problem for most organizations; 
they spend a lot of effort trying to design and maintain systems that will 
stand up to different circumstances. (I explain more about the general prob-
lem of dealing with the environment in the section on open systems.)
Especially for the very complex decisions that are made by the highest-
ranking members of an organization, a particular challenge is to decide how 
much information to gather before making a decision. Imagine you’re running 
the coffee business I describe in the first section of this chapter, and you’re 
trying to decide where to open your next location. You have to consider 
rents, local laws, the location of competitors, the potential supply of workers 
and customers, and many other factors. How do you know when you’ve gath-
ered enough information to make the best decision about where to open your 
next store?
Herbert Simon, one of the all-time great scholars of organizations, coined the 
term “bounded rationality” to refer to the fact that the rationality of human 
decision-makers is “bounded” by the amount of time they have to gather 
information and make decisions — as well as, needless to say, by the limited 
computing power of their human brains. (For more on decision-making by 
individuals, see Chapter 6.)
Simon’s work has been a major influence on management consultants, who 
are today’s Frederick Taylors. Management consultants are specialists in 
organizational behavior — many consultants, in fact, have been trained as 
sociologists — who are hired by companies, as Taylor was, to serve as out-
side evaluators who can help a company design its operations as effectively 
and efficiently as possible.
Not only do management consultants have to consider the bounds on the 
rationality of the people at the companies they’re studying, they need to con-
sider the bounds on their own rationality. My friend became a management 
consultant after graduating from college, and I was surprised when he told 
me that his company might spend as little as two weeks studying a company 
before making a series of recommendations. When I asked why they didn’t 
spend more time, he explained that they could spend a lot more time — but 
that probably wouldn’t result in recommendations that were dramatically 
more useful. Two weeks, his firm had learned, is enough time to gather most 
of the important information about a company’s operations.
The success of management consultants would seem to vindicate Taylor and 
his overall approach: Objective, scientific study can help improve business 
operations by a great deal. But why do businesses need to hire outside evalu-
ators? Why hire a 21-year-old who knows nothing about your company to 
make management recommendations, rather than turning to a company vet-
eran who knows all the organization’s ins and outs?

222
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
There are a few good reasons for this, but one of them is that sometimes 
people are more willing to listen to an outsider than to someone who they 
know well. Someone you know well may have biases or conflicts of interest that 
might get in the way of his making decisions that are best for the organization. 
How can you objectively decide which of your employees’ jobs to eliminate 
when you’ve become friends with all of them? People’s rationality is limited 
not only by their time and brainpower, but by the fact that they are human, 
with human relationships and human needs. They’re not robots, and that’s the 
insight at the heart of the next perspective: the natural system perspective.
Natural Systems: We’re Only Human
As the limits of Taylor’s “scientific management” became clear, sociologists 
started to realize that understanding organizations means understanding the 
people who make up the organizations. People are not interchangeable cogs 
who behave like robots; they’re human beings who behave like . . . well, like 
human beings. In this section, I first describe a famous set of studies that 
demonstrated the limitations of Taylorism; then I explain how this insight led 
to the “corporate culture” movement that has brought us innovations like 
Casual Fridays and logo-printed baseball caps. (Richard W. Scott, the sociolo-
gist who devised the rational/natural/open system typology, also considers 
the drift of organizational purpose to be an insight of the natural-system per-
spective; I discuss that idea at the end of this chapter.)
Making people feel special: The Hawthorne 
Studies and the Human Relations Movement
In the 1920s and 30s, a team supervised by Elton Mayo, a professor at 
Harvard Business School, undertook a Taylor-like study of productivity at the 
Hawthorne works, a manufacturing plant near Chicago. Like good social sci-
entists, they took a measure of productivity under the initial conditions as a 
baseline, then subjected certain groups of workers to changes in their work-
ing conditions to see whether they could increase the workers’ productivity.
In their experiments, the investigators tried changing many aspects of the 
working environment:
 
✓ They changed the levels of lighting, from especially bright to especially 
dim.
 
✓ They tried shortening the work day, to see whether that would increase 
workers’ hourly productivity.
 
✓ They varied the length of breaks the workers were given.

223
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
 
✓ They tried giving the workers food on breaks.
 
✓ They varied the way workers were paid, experimenting with reward-
ing workers for individual productivity and rewarding them for overall 
group productivity.
This went on for years, and the researchers were confounded to see that no 
matter what they did, just about every variation they introduced improved 
productivity! At least in the short term, almost every change made to the 
work environment caused the workers’ productivity to increase. In the end, 
Mayo concluded that the workers were becoming more productive not 
because of the nature of the specific changes, but because they knew they 
were being observed.
Even though in most circumstances the workers weren’t being rewarded 
for the additional productivity, their behavior changed simply because of 
the way they felt about the situation. In later interviews, they explained to 
Mayo’s team that they enjoyed being a part of the investigation and that they 
appreciated feeling like they were being paid attention to, that their opinions 
and experiences were noted and valued.
This discovery — which later became known as “the Hawthorne Effect” — 
provided Mayo and other sociologists with direct evidence that Taylor had 
been mistaken in thinking that the best strategy for increasing productivity 
was to take away employees’ individual initiative, to tell them how to do their 
own jobs. 
 
The workers who protested Taylor’s policies, it turned out, had been right: 
people do their best work when they feel valued and respected, not when 
they’re treated like robots. (If you’ve ever been treated that way at a job, you 
understand why it doesn’t help workers’ motivation!)
This insight provided the genesis of what was called “the Human Relations 
Movement.” Based on the Hawthorne Studies and other research, Mayo 
argued that effective organizations need to pay attention to the relationships 
among their workers. Many people believe that the most important factor in 
job happiness is not the nature of your work but rather the nature of your 
coworkers: If you like the people you work with and feel respected by them, 
you’ll give the job your all. People want to feel like they’re part of a team, not 
like they’re part of a machine.
This meant, said Mayo, that both sociologists and CEOs needed to pay atten-
tion to these aspects of corporate life:
 
✓ The relationships among workers, the social groups they form that over-
lap with their working groups. For people working in a company, their 
social relationships are just as important as — if not more important 
than — their working relationships.

224
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
 
✓ Communication among workers and management. Workers need to feel 
like they have a personal stake in the company, like their experiences and 
opinions are heeded and respected. Communication can’t just flow from 
managers to workers; it has to flow from workers to managers as well.
 
✓ Managers’ skill as leaders. A good manager isn’t just a paragon of effi-
ciency; they have social skills as well and can inspire workers to do their 
best. A manager who doesn’t win their employees’ respect and admira-
tion isn’t a good manager, no matter what their level of technical skill 
and professional judgment.
 
To be precise, the Hawthorne Studies didn’t prove that workers’ productivity 
improved if they actually had influence over their work situation; it improved 
if they felt like they had influence. Today’s corporate culture movement is as 
much about cultivating workers’ feelings toward their employers as it is about 
actually giving them a voice in their work situations.
Corporate culture: Trust 
falls and free coffee
Have you ever worked for, or heard about, a company that takes any of these 
actions?
 
✓ Holds corporate retreats so employees can get to know one another?
 
✓ Gives employees free coffee, soda, or even beer?
 
✓ Creates mousepads, posters, t-shirts, pens, and other items with the 
company logo?
 
✓ Allows employees to take break from works to play Foosball or ping-pong?
 
✓ Allows employees to bring pets to work?
All of these things would absolutely appall Frederick Taylor, a man for whom 
efficiency was the bottom line. None of these things have anything to do with get-
ting a job done — in fact, they all seem like perks and activities that are liable to 
be distractions. So why are they such common practices in the corporate world?
These practices are the legacy of Mayo’s Human Relations Movement. Today, 
owners of corporations appreciate that if workers aren’t happy, they won’t be 
productive. This is true of any workplace, but it’s especially true of modern 
workplaces, where much of the routine work that formerly was done by people 
has been automated, and more people are called upon to be creative at work. 
The dot-com boom of the 1990s saw astonishingly open workplaces sprout up 

225
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
in Silicon Valley and other technology hotbeds, with workers being encour-
aged to come and go as they pleased, treating their workplaces as extensions 
of their homes. The Google corporate campus is famous for its open plan, its 
comfortable feel, and its amenities like food, drink, and exercise equipment.
Today, a great number of businesspeople and social scientists study the work 
environment in what is known as the study of “corporate culture.” Some of 
these studies are very practical — how many parties should a company hold 
each year? — and some of them are abstract and academic, looking for paral-
lels between the way corporate culture works and the way culture works gen-
erally (see Chapter 5). What they all share is a fundamental acknowledgement 
that life at work is about much more than just “getting the job done.”
 
One danger with attending to “corporate culture” is thinking that a surface 
layer of attention to employees as individuals is good enough — that it can 
remove the need for an organizational structure that actually gives those 
employees a voice in how things are done.
Larry Summers’s hard lesson in soft skills
“Soft skills” is a management term used to 
describe what you might call “people skills”: 
the ability to get along with others and win their 
trust. In his five years as president of Harvard 
University — ironically, the same institution 
where Elton Mayo founded the Human Relations 
Movement — Lawrence Summers learned the 
hard way just how important “soft skills” are.
Summers became president of Harvard in 2001, 
amidst great fanfare and excitement. He was 
a brilliant economist who had been one of the 
youngest people ever tenured at Harvard and 
then had served as Secretary of the Treasury 
under President Bill Clinton. He had lots of 
ideas about how to increase Harvard’s effi-
ciency, and he wasn’t afraid to ask hard ques-
tions about the status quo. Harvard’s governing 
body hired Summers because they knew he 
would have the tenacity to push for a major 
campus expansion they viewed as important.
After Summers was in office, though, he made 
one human-relations misstep after another. 
Faculty and administrators felt that he ran the 
university like a rigorous graduate seminar, 
asking his tough questions in a way that made 
them feel threatened, uncomfortable, and dis-
respected. Cornel West, a professor of African-
American studies who was one of the university’s 
most popular faculty members, abruptly left for 
Princeton University when Summers offended 
him by suggesting that West was neglecting his 
academic research. Most damningly, Summers 
tactlessly suggested to a conference on women 
in science that they should consider whether the 
traditional dominance of men in math and sci-
ence was partially due to men’s greater inborn 
ability in those areas. Eventually, the arts and sci-
ence faculty voted that they had no confidence in 
Summers, and he resigned in disgrace.
As sound as Summers’s organizational ideas 
may have been, his experience at Harvard dem-
onstrated the danger of being insensitive to 
your employees’ feelings. As Elton Mayo knew, 
a leader who fails to inspire is a leader who fails.

226
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
In a study of corporate whistleblowers, sociologist Jim Detert found that 
almost all companies encourage their employees to communicate openly 
with management — but that when employees actually do express grievances 
or make suggestions, they’re very often dismissed offhand. (Executives are 
then mystified when it’s revealed that there are major problems with their 
operation — “Why didn’t anyone tell us?”) Mousepads, polo shirts, and flashy 
performance awards are no substitute for corporate policies that genuinely 
respect all members of an organization.
Open Systems: The Whole 
Wide World of Work
Both the rational-system and the natural-system perspectives attend to life 
inside of organizations; but over time, sociologists came to realize that it’s 
impossible to really understand any organization without understanding its 
environment: all the social conditions surrounding the organization. In this 
section, I discuss the topics of setting organizational boundaries, seeing orga-
nizations as networks, institutional isomorphism (a.k.a. the “me-toos”), and 
organizational mission drift.
Getting down to business: Dolly knows best
In the 1980 movie 9 to 5, Dabney Coleman plays 
a sexist, know-it-all boss who thinks he knows 
how to run an office. He doesn’t allow his work-
ers to display any personal belongings; their 
bare desks are arranged in perfect rows. “An 
office that looks efficient,” goes his motto, “is 
efficient!” He’s inattentive to his employees’ 
personal needs, and in fact sexually harasses 
his secretary, played by Dolly Parton.
When an unusual chain of circumstances leads 
to Coleman being absent from the office for sev-
eral weeks, Parton and two other employees — 
played by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda — sign 
his name to memos changing office policies. 
Personal photos and decorations are encour-
aged, new flexible time-share arrangements 
are instituted, and the company even opens 
a daycare for the convenience of working 
parents. Coleman is flabbergasted when he 
returns, but before he has time to change any-
thing back, the chairman of the board arrives 
and personally praises Coleman for the dra-
matic rise in productivity Coleman’s brought 
about with “his” new policies.
The movie plays this all for laughs, but it reflects 
a very real change in corporate culture that was 
taking place at that time, as women — often 
working mothers — poured into offices and 
companies that once ran Tayloresque opera-
tions with rows of men sitting in desks and 
working from nine to five came to terms with 
the reality that the members of their new work-
force had different needs. The movie reflects 
companies’ growing understanding that work-
ers are not interchangeable, and that running 
a workplace based on standards of pure “effi-
ciency” is actually not all that efficient.

227
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
Keeping the riff-raff out: Setting 
organizational boundaries
The fundamental insight of the open-system perspective is that no organiza-
tion is an island.
Think of a very simple organization: two kids running a lemonade stand. The 
life of the organization is in its relationships with the outside world. These 
kids need a steady supply of lemonade mix from the kitchen cupboard or 
the grocery store; and they need an equally steady supply of customers who 
will buy the lemonade. With a more complex organization, such as the coffee 
chain I describe at the start of this chapter, the organization’s relationships 
with the outside world can be fearfully complex.
First, they have their suppliers. Just to name a few:
 
✓ Coffee growers
 
✓ Paper cup manufacturers
 
✓ Providers of heat, water, and other utilities
Then, they have their customers, including:
 
✓ Individuals who buy coffee
 
✓ Franchisees who buy the rights to sell coffee
 
✓ Supermarkets who buy coffee in bulk
Finally, there are all the other individuals and organizations they must deal 
with:
 
✓ Governments and regulatory agencies
 
✓ Landlords
 
✓ Transportation companies
 
✓ Competitors
If any of these people make any significant change, the organization is 
going to have to change, too. Frederick Taylor might be able to walk into a 
Starbucks today and come up with an ideal workflow and organization, but 
that might all change tomorrow if circumstances change. Changing opera-
tional procedures is costly and troublesome for any organization, especially 
if an organization needs to exert effort just to find out what conditions are; so 
organizations seek to minimize uncertainty.
One relatively straightforward way to minimize uncertainty is to absorb 
uncertain elements of the environment right into your organization. 

228
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Coffee suppliers giving you a hard time and changing their prices often? Buy 
a farm and grow your own coffee! Franchisees getting hard to negotiate with? 
Then operate your own stores! Landlords giving you headaches? Buy your 
own building!
The logic is appealing, and in fact many large companies do expand to own 
almost the entire chain of production. A retail store might operate its own 
factory in China, ship its own products to the United States, distribute them 
itself, and own and operate its own stores; just about the only things those 
companies don’t own are their customers!
Companies can further insulate themselves against instability by expand-
ing into other lines. The company that owns the Gap mid-price clothing 
retailer, for example, also owns the high-end Banana Republic chain and the 
low-priced Old Navy chain; whether sales sag at the high end or the low end 
of the market, Gap, Inc. has its other stores to help pick up the slack. Some 
companies, known as “conglomerates,” even go so far as to buy completely 
unrelated businesses — like diversifying a stock portfolio.
At some point, though, it becomes unwieldy to manage. Companies often 
find it more efficient to outsource operations like cleaning, transportation, 
and security, rather than try to run those things themselves. In other words, 
organizations need to set their boundaries — they need to decide which 
operations will be part of the organization and which will be part of the envi-
ronment. The best answer is rarely obvious, but it’s a question that all orga-
nizations need to consider.
Organizations as networks, 
networks in organizations
In Chapter 7, I describe the network perspective in sociology and explain 
what network analysts have contributed to the understanding of society. 
Understanding the complex nature social networks is key to understanding 
organizations.
Most of my focus in Chapter 7 is on networks of individuals: Your personal 
network is the network of individuals you’re acquainted with or otherwise 
connected to. If you read that chapter and the earlier sections of this chap-
ter, you can see how network analysis fits well with the natural-system view 
of organizations. You have a professional network that might be drawn on 
a map of your company’s bureaucracy: There are people you’re officially 
expected to know and interact with in certain ways as part of your job.

229
 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
On top of that, however, you also have a personal network at your company: 
You have friends at work, and your personal relationships certainly don’t 
overlap perfectly with your professional relationships. This distinction 
becomes important when you consider that professional information can 
flow through personal networks just as quickly, if not even more quickly, than 
through professional networks.
To add another layer of complexity, consider the fact that your personal 
and professional networks both spread well beyond your company. Many of 
these connections have little or nothing to do with your professional work, 
but many of them do — companies are connected by complicated webs of 
personal ties in addition to all the professional ties they need to maintain. 
This can be extremely tricky for companies to negotiate, and sociologists 
appreciate that a company’s environment impacts that company through 
both personal and professional networks.
Institutional isomorphism: If that company 
jumped off a cliff, would your company 
jump off a cliff, too?
If you’ve been reading this chapter from the beginning, you’ve seen how 
the tidy world of Frederick Taylor has come unglued as social scientists 
have revealed one reason after another why understanding organizational 
life isn’t like understanding a machine. To some extent it’s accurate to say 
that an effective organization is designed like an efficient machine, but the 
more closely you look at the realities of organizational life, the more clear it 
becomes that “efficiency” and “effectiveness” are very often not things that 
can be objectively measured.
When organizations face so many choices about what to do and how to do 
it, it can be hard to see what they’re “supposed” to be doing. You may recog-
nize this feeling from your own life: Think of your first day at a new school or 
in a new job. You walk into the place with a general idea of what you’re sup-
posed to be doing, but there’s still a lot you don’t know and you’re not going 
to be explicitly told. What are you supposed to wear? What are you supposed 
to talk about? How often are you supposed to take breaks? If the coffee is 
gone, whose problem is that? What you’ll probably end up doing is just look-
ing around and doing whatever everybody else is doing.
Organizations — from governments to retailers to nonprofits — have the 
same problem, and often they solve it in the same way: by doing what every-
one else is doing. This is called isomorphism.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Sociologists Paul DiMaggio and Walter W. Powell note that there are three dif-
ferent reasons why companies behave in an isomorphic manner — in other 
words, why they copycat one another.
 
✓ Coercive isomorphism happens when an organization feels like it needs 
to act in a certain way or it will be punished (formally or informally). For 
example, a country that doesn’t respect certain human rights will find 
itself facing economic sanctions from the rest of the world — if it drafts 
children into its army or denies women the right to vote, it will be ostra-
cized from the global community.
 
✓ Mimetic isomorphism is instinctive behavior in response to uncertainty, 
like when you’re unsure what to wear so you decide to wear what every-
one else is wearing. Say that hypothetical coffee company doesn’t know 
whether or not to sell tea; it might be profitable, or it might not. What to 
do? Why not see what the other coffee companies are doing, and follow 
suit?
 
✓ Normative isomorphism is, according to DiMaggio and Powell, the 
result of professionalization. Though individual health clinics, in a 
private healthcare system like in the United States, compete with one 
another for patients, it’s in the interest of the entire medical field for 
doctors and nurses to be trained only at certain accredited institutions. 
This means that healthcare professionals across the United States are 
similarly trained and are bound to follow similar procedures no matter 
where they work.
Sociologist John Meyer has spent his career studying institutional isomor-
phism, and he believes that the pressures for organizations to conform are so 
great that they’ll often converge on the same way of doing things even when it 
seems completely illogical. He points out, for example, that tiny, desperately 
poor countries will found their own national airlines even when their people 
are starving; they feel they need to win the respect of the international com-
munity, and they don’t think they can do that without having things like a 
national airline. Again, this may remind you of your own behavior — have you 
ever spent money on a status symbol when you really ought to have used it for 
something else?
 
In Chapter 5 I explain the sociological difference between “culture” and “struc-
ture,” and the debate over the role culture plays in society. The work of John 
Meyer and like-minded sociologists is a demonstration of the importance of 
culture: If structure were all that mattered, each organization would do exactly 
what its unique circumstances dictated, regardless of what other organiza-
tions are up to — unless those organizations are directly forcing compliance 
with a certain behavior. In many cases, though, cultural ideas about what 
they’re “supposed” to be doing actually define how organizations see them-
selves and set their priorities.

 Chapter 12: Corporate Culture: The Study of Organizations (and Disorganizations)
Mission drift: Searching for a purpose
If you need any further evidence that social organizations are more than just 
machines doing set jobs, consider how often their missions drift from what 
they were originally “designed” to do.
 
✓ Political parties may change their positions over the decades, as other 
parties rise and fall and different coalitions come together to support 
the parties. The current Republican Party in the United States is the 
same party that President Lincoln was part of in the 1860s, but it’s not 
certain that Lincoln would consider himself a Republican today.
 
✓ Businesses may switch their products as the market changes. For exam-
ple, when the success of Starbucks demonstrated how much customers 
were willing to pay for a cup of coffee, Dunkin’ Donuts switched its busi-
ness model and now makes most of its profits not from doughnuts but 
from coffee.
The world’s smartest sheep
A colleague and I spent several years studying 
universities around the world; specifically, we 
looked at changes in the academic subjects that 
were taught and studied there. We found that to 
an amazing extent, universities from Malawi to 
Jamaica to England to Japan maintained simi-
lar curricula, and that their curricula changed in 
the same ways over the course of the 20th cen-
tury. The social sciences (especially sociology!) 
became studied much more frequently around 
the world, and the humanities much less fre-
quently. This was true even among countries that 
were very different in many ways — faculty at 
their universities seemed to imitate one another 
like sheep in a field.
Why did all these universities change in the 
same ways? All three of the mechanisms iden-
tified by Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell 
(see “Institutional isomorphism” section of 
this chapter) were at play. To some extent uni-
versities needed to pursue certain subjects to 
please funders and attract students (coercive 
isomorphism), to some extent they converged 
on the same way of doing things because all 
their faculty were trained at the same institu-
tions (normative isomorphism), and to some 
extent they just pursued certain subjects 
because that’s what everyone else was doing 
(mimetic isomorphism).
It’s an especially interesting example of iso-
morphism, we think, because universities claim 
to present the truth. The subjects taught at 
colleges are supposedly the most important 
subjects for people in the world to know about. 
The fact that university curricula are becom-
ing more and more similar around the world is 
evidence, we believe, that people in different 
countries are becoming more and more similar 
in the way they see the world, in what they think 
is important to know and do. (See Chapter 16 for 
more on globalization.)

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
 
✓ Charismatic leaders may sway the focus of an organization. For example, 
as leader of the Guggenheim Foundation, Thomas Krens controversially 
turned the organization’s focus from maintaining its landmark museum 
in New York City to expanding is presence with new museums in cities 
around the world.
As several sociologists have noted, when established, organizations tend to 
focus on preserving themselves rather than on fulfilling their mission; if self-
preservation leads down a different road than the organization initially fol-
lowed, it will tend to go down that road.
Occasionally this means a dramatic about-face in an organization’s purpose, 
but more often changes in organizational purpose occur in a gentle drift. 
One function that used to be performed is no longer performed, and one new 
function is added. A former goal is dropped, and a new one acquired. Before 
you know it, the organization is doing something very different than it was 
doing in the first place.
Given that complex organizations may have a large number of potential goals 
to achieve, this “mission drift” can happen very easily. In fact, some sociolo-
gists wonder whether it even makes sense to think of complex organizations 
as having any real “purpose” in any meaningful sense of that word.
In 1972, social scientists Michael D. Cohen, James G. March, and Johan P. Olsen 
invented what they called the “Garbage Can Model” of organizations. When 
very complex organizations are put in highly uncertain situations, Cohen, 
March, and Olsen argued, the result can be that the organization’s behaviors 
seem to have little to do with either problems to be solved or with reasonable 
solutions to those problems. There are any number of actions the organization 
can take at any time, and they’re taken almost randomly, as though they were 
being pulled out of an overflowing garbage can. Each action has some costs 
but reaps some rewards, and the organization lumbers along aimlessly.
Cohen, March, and Olsen’s classic example was a university: There are so 
many different things a university can do — regarding teaching, research, 
administration, public outreach, student life — that might qualify as part of its 
mission, and a university’s decision-making structure is often so sprawling and 
decentralized, that a university can seem to be doing a little bit of everything at 
once, without a clear purpose to any of its actions. No wonder Larry Summers 
was frustrated! (See sidebar, “Larry Summers’s hard lesson in soft skills.”)
All this may make it sound like organizations are completely ineffective — 
and indeed, it often seems that way! But in fact they are not; they’re power-
ful means to accomplish collective goals. If the nature of those goals drifts 
around from time to time . . . well, that’s how people act individually. Why 
shouldn’t they act that way collectively?

The Rules of the Game:

Political Sociology
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the role of government in society
▶ Thinking about power: how it’s shared, and not shared
▶ Getting social movements off the ground
W
hen you’re paying your taxes or applying for a passport, it may seem 
like government is all-powerful. Government decides what you can 
and can’t do, where you can and can’t go, what money it takes and what 
money it lets you keep. With all these rules, regs, and restrictions, it seems 
like “government” and “society” are the same thing.
It’s true that government has a unique role in society; it’s the manager of 
society, determining the rules of the game and the allocation of resources. 
But government is only a part of society: Government is affected by social 
forces outside itself, and it often changes. Sometimes those changes are 
sudden and violent — as in political revolutions — and sometimes those 
changes are gradual, with laws and policies shifting slowly over many years 
or decades.
Political sociologists study not only the way government works, but the way 
it interacts with other social institutions. In this chapter, I first explain, from 
a sociological perspective, what government is. Then I explain how sociolo-
gists think about power in society, and finally I summarize what sociologists 
have discovered about social movements formed to effect change in govern-
ment and society.

234
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Government: Governing 
and Being Governed
So what is government, and how does it work? Those are big-picture ques-
tions, and sociologists who study them have to step way back and consider 
many different societies at many points in time. In this section, I first explain 
what “the state” is, and then tell you what we know about the causes of politi-
cal revolutions — the points at which everything can change, and at which all 
bets are off.
Social structure and the state
The United States uses the term “state” to refer to one of the 50 little govern-
ments that make up the nation, but sociologists and political scientists use 
the term “the state” to refer to the overall government. Like many social 
institutions, “the state” (a.k.a. “the government”) is something people know 
when they see it, but it can be slippery to define. Think of all these different 
examples of governments:
 
✓ Traditional rule by wise elders (A tribal chieftain and a tribal council)
 
✓ Imperial republic (The Roman Empire)
 
✓ Monarchy (King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table)
 
✓ Democratic republic (The Canadian Prime Minister and Parliament)
 
✓ Theocracy (The Supreme Leader of Iran, with a Council of Guardians 
and Assembly of Experts)
 
✓ Communist republic (The Chinese President, National People’s 
Congress, and State Council)
They’re all very different, but what they have in common is that they’re the 
legitimate users of force. In other words, a government is, fundamentally, that 
organization in society that reserves for itself — or has delegated to it — the 
ultimate right to use force to compel people to behave in a certain way. If you 
are going to use any kind of force to bend people to your will, you had best 
have the support of your society’s government or you could find yourself in 
trouble.
Beyond this basic, defining characteristic, governments take many different 
forms. They arise, persist, and end for different reasons. Some governments 
are pure dictatorships, where a leader enforces their will over a group of 
people simply because they have influence over the army and the police and 

235
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
can punish anyone who does not do as they say. Most, though, at least nomi-
nally govern with the consent of the governed — in other words, they have 
the support of the majority of the people in their power. In most countries 
today, the majority of citizens support the system of government, even if not 
the specific people who are in power at any given time.
Political scientists and legal scholars are specifically interested in the work-
ings of government, sometimes very particular governments. They share 
many interests with sociologists, but fundamentally, the reason you’d call 
yourself a “political sociologist” instead of a “political scientist” is that you’re 
interested in the workings of society generally, not just in the specific work-
ings of government. The core questions political sociologists ask about gov-
ernment are:
How does government work, and . . .
How does it interact with the rest of society?
Look back at the list of government examples. It includes several different 
types of government, such as theocracy, monarchy, and communist republic. 
Sociologists would like to know how each of those types of government work, 
but they’d also like to know why different societies have different types of gov-
ernment. Is it just a coincidence that China is a communist country, Canada 
is a democratic republic, and Iran is a theocracy? (A “theocracy” is a country 
where religious leaders also control the government.) Maybe . . . or maybe 
there’s something about each of those societies that caused those different 
types of government to arise. That’s what sociologists would like to know.
They’d also like to know how each of those different types of government 
interacts with other social institutions, such as the economic system and the 
educational system. Governments are officially “in charge” of the people they 
rule, but there are many powers that governments don’t have:
 
✓ They can’t change culture and customs, though they can influence both 
(see Chapter 5).
 
✓ They can’t control the economy, though they can influence it (also see 
Chapter 5).
 
✓ They can’t enforce all their laws all the time (see Chapter 11).
 
✓ They can’t control the outside world (governments, like other organiza-
tions, are open systems — see Chapter 12).
All of these other institutions — culture, the economy, other governments, 
and outside powers — influence governments in complicated ways, and polit-
ical sociologists are curious about all those interactions. That’s what the rest 
of this chapter is about.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
The big takeover: Causes 
of political revolution
When it comes to government, political revolution is about the biggest 
change there is. In a revolution, an existing government is forcefully over-
thrown and replaced by another.
Political revolution has been a hot topic among sociologists from the very 
beginning, in part because sociology was born in a world wracked by revolu-
tion (see Chapter 3). The European revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries 
were horrifically violent and disruptive, and one of the reasons a scientific 
approach to society seemed so appealing was that if sociologists could deter-
mine the causes of political revolutions, they could possibly help to prevent 
them — or at least to help people carry them off in a more peaceful, less dis-
ruptive manner.
After 200 years of investigations, sociologists still haven’t come up with a 
“recipe for revolution,” but their investigations have made clear just how 
precarious governments really are. If you live in a country with a functioning 
government that is reasonably stable, does a good job of meeting people’s 
basic requirements, and is at least somewhat responsive to its citizens’ 
changing needs and demands, consider yourself lucky — that government is 
one of the greatest achievements of the human race.
Think about all the actions that can destabilize or topple a government:
 
✓ An environmental catastrophe, like a drought or natural disaster (for 
example, the Rapanui of Easter Island who ran short of resources and 
fell into disastrous conflict with each other)
 
✓ An outside attack by an aggressive neighbor (for example, European 
nations in the Second World War)
 
✓ Internal fighting or disorganization among the people in the government 
(for example, the American Civil War)
 
✓ Too much economic inequality, which can cause the have-nots to rise 
up and take over (for example, the French Revolution)
 
✓ A cultural challenge to the justification for the system of government 
(for example, the Russian Revolution)
In large, complex societies with relatively elaborate governments, there is 
rarely any one single cause that can be isolated as the reason for a revolu-
tion. Usually economic, social, and political factors interact to weaken a gov-
ernment’s grip; then a charismatic opposition leader or external challenge 
becomes the straw that breaks the camel’s back.

237
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
The challenges of understanding political stability and instability are well 
understood not only by sociologists but by leaders who have tried to stabi-
lize their own governments or — in some cases — the governments of other 
countries. Various world powers that have tried intervening to topple other 
governments have further learned that there’s no magic trick that can induce 
a revolution, either.
Still, “nation building” has become its own discipline, studied by military 
and political leaders the world over who want to help build stable, peaceful 
governments both inside and outside their own countries. It’s not easy, but 
there are some common principles sociologists and other social scientists 
have established as being important for a government to gain and keep the 
support of its citizens.
 
✓ A functioning infrastructure, with people’s basic needs (food, health, 
shelter, transportation) being met
 
✓ A stable economy, with people able to find legitimate work to feed them-
selves and their families
 
✓ A transparent system of government, where people feel that officials are 
honest and accountable for their actions
 
✓ Official respect for cultural and religious traditions
 
✓ A sense of independence from foreign influence, especially the influence 
of foreign powers not seen as friendly or supportive
It sounds simple, but it’s extremely tricky. A functioning government that 
successfully balances the needs of a large, diverse group of citizens requires 
the trust and support of those citizens — and in the wake of war or turmoil, 
or if a previous government was corrupt or irresponsible, people may be 
very wary and reluctant to trust the official powers.
When you read the news, you may sometimes find it difficult to trust your 
own government. Does it deserve your support? Your government needs to 
earn your trust and support, and the trust and support of your neighbors, 
every day — when governments are unable or unwilling to make their citi-
zens happy, things start to get ugly.
 
Though sociologists have learned a lot about the causes of political stability 
and instability, there’s no perfect formula for determining whether a govern-
ment will stand or fall. You may be able to think of contemporary examples of 
governments that fail to meet their citizens’ basic needs and yet still stand 
strong — why? It may be that there is no sufficiently organized opposition, or 
it may be that they’ve manipulated their citizens into believing that there is no 
superior alternative.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Sharing (or Not Sharing) 
Power in Society
Questions about the state and social movements tend to boil down to ques-
tions about power in society. What is power? Who has it, and when do they 
(or don’t they) share it? If one person has more power, does that necessarily 
mean others have less? In this section, I summarize the two main ideas soci-
ologists have about power in society — the idea that power is a limited quan-
tity that cannot be shared, and the idea that power is a collective good that 
everyone can work together for.
But how do they know?
To ask what factors cause political revolutions 
is to ask a big question. As I explain in Chapter 4, 
sociologists who ask big questions have to 
make do with fewer comparative cases than 
sociologists who ask little questions. If I want to 
know what factors cause a person to vote one 
way or another, I can survey millions of people 
(providing I have the time). If I want to know 
what factors cause a political revolution, I don’t 
have that many examples to look at. What’s 
more, if I’m surveying individual people, I can 
survey a bunch of people who are all living at 
the same time, in very similar conditions. If I’m 
looking at political revolutions, I’m going to have 
to go back in history for examples, which means 
that I’ll be looking at revolutions that happened 
at different times and in different places. That 
can make them hard to compare for similarities 
and differences.
One of the best-regarded sociological studies of 
political revolutions is Theda Skocpol’s States 
and Social Revolutions, published in 1979. 
It’s a careful analysis of revolutions in France 
(1789), China (1911), and Russia (1917). Skocpol’s 
study has been influential, but it’s also been 
criticized — as have been many similar 
studies — for having too few examples. 
Sociologists point out that you would never try 
to build a theory of job change based on study-
ing only three people, so how can you build 
a theory of revolutions based on only three 
countries? Don’t you have to look at many more 
examples to see what the patterns are?
There’s no easy answer to that question: 
Ultimately, every sociologist has to decide for 
themselves what counts as valid evidence. If 
you don’t have hundreds of revolutions to go on, 
does that mean you should give up even trying 
to understand them — or should you do the best 
you can with the evidence available to you? 
Sociologists may disagree about the answer to 
that question, but what they do agree on is that 
all evidence should be carefully, systematically 
examined and that, even though evidence is 
always limited, more is always better than less.

239
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
Conflict models: Every man, woman, 
and child for themselves
One way to think about power is as influence over other people. This is prob-
ably the most “common sense” way to think about power: If I have a lot of 
power, I have the ability to compel a lot of other people to do as I want them 
to. If I have only a little power, there are few people I’m in a position to coerce, 
and I’m going to spend a lot of time doing what other people want me to do.
This is what’s known as a zero-sum view of power. It means that there is a 
limited amount of power to go around, and if I get more power, you must 
have less. Either you have power over me, or I have power over you. It’s as 
simple as that.
Naturally, in this view, power is something that everybody wants. If I don’t 
have power, that must mean that someone else has power over me; while 
that person might choose to be nice to me, they might just as easily make a 
decision that I’m unhappy with. The best-case scenario for me would be to 
have all the power for myself, and that way I can call the shots.
This way of thinking about power doesn’t necessarily mean that one person 
in a given society needs to have all the power — different people may have 
power in different situations, or for different reasons. I might have power 
because of my money, for example, while you might have power because 
you’re ridiculously good looking. A third person — let’s call him Don — might 
have power because of his extensive social connections. We each have some 
power, and each of us can be especially influential in different situations.
Still, when the rubber hits the road, only one of us can come out on top. If all 
three of us run for elected office, we can each try to use our power to win:
I can buy lots of ads for my campaign.
You can make lots of personal appearances and wow voters with your 
good looks.
Don can work his connections and try to get influential people to per-
suade voters on his behalf.
We can probably each earn lots of votes, but only one of us is going to get the 
most votes. In a zero-sum model of power, power may have different sources, 
but it all ultimately comes down to the basic question of who gets their way.

240
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
 
Sociologists who think this way about power are often called conflict theorists 
because they theorize that everyone is in conflict with everyone else, pretty 
much all the time. Sometimes they might work together to achieve certain 
shared goals, but when their common purpose is achieved (or frustrated), 
they’ll part ways. If this is how you think about power, you likely think of a 
political party as an uneasy coalition of people who make a truce to put a can-
didate in power, but might otherwise have nothing in common.
The granddaddy of conflict theorists was Karl Marx. In fact, this kind of 
theory about the social or political world is often called a Marxist theory. As 
noted in Chapter 3, Marx believed that power and influence in society were 
largely about material goods: food, clothing, land, and other resources, repre-
sented in a modern capitalist economy by money.
Marx distrusted money because it’s like liquid power: It flows easily from 
one person to another, and it can be easily used by one person or group of 
people to gain advantage over others. If your assets are in the form of land, 
a house, cattle, skills, or even social connections, I might be able to swindle 
you out of those things — but it’s going to be a lot easier for me to swindle 
you out of your money. 
 
Precisely as Marx would have feared, when the Soviet Union ended and 
Russian citizens were given large sums of money representing their share of 
formerly state-owned enterprises, many were quickly cheated out of it and 
were left with nothing.)
You can see why Marxist political thinkers are often concerned with the 
influence of money on the government. In fact, Marxists tend to see the gov-
ernment as essentially a tool of the wealthy, something that exists at the 
pleasure of — and for the convenience of — people with money. A Marxist, 
zero-sum view of political power is to some degree behind each of these con-
cerns about politics:
 
✓ Campaign finance. Should wealthy candidates (and candidates with 
wealthy supporters) be allowed to spend as much money as they want 
on their political campaigns, or should there be laws to equalize funding 
among all candidates?
 
✓ Lobbying and gifts. Should corporations and other organizations be 
able to employ lobbyists whose job is to get the attention of officehold-
ers? Should the access and privileges of lobbyists be limited? Should 
officeholders be limited in the type and amount of gifts they’re able to 
receive — to prevent “gifts” from being used as bribes?
 
✓ Term limits. Should officeholders be able to stay in office for as long as 
they can gain the majority of the vote, potentially accruing more and 
more power and influence with each term and becoming harder and 
harder to beat — or should officeholders be subject to term limits, pre-
venting them from serving beyond a certain amount of time?

241
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
These and other issues reflect people’s underlying concern that one person 
or group of people might have too much influence, for too long, over what 
the government does. They reflect a concern that the government will use its 
power for the good of one or a few rather than being fair to all.
 
A big debate among political sociologists concerns “the autonomy of the state.” 
The question, in other words, is whether the government actually has any inde-
pendent influence and power in society, or whether it’s strictly a tool of other 
interests. Marx believed that the state, at least in modern capitalist society, 
had little autonomy — that it was essentially a tool of the bourgeois. This was 
a view shared by 20th century Marxist C. Wright Mills (see Chapter 3), whose 
book The Power Elite suggested that if the wealthy told the government to 
jump, the government’s answer would be, “How high?”
Others point out that the government does have a lot of independent power, 
by virtue of its unique role in society. The government, after all, has the guns; 
even the wealthiest members of society must obey the government’s laws, 
or they’ll find themselves on the wrong side of a set of jail bars. In revolu-
tions like the Russian Revolution, the government can seize the assets of the 
wealthy and redistribute them (or keep the assets for itself); short of that, 
governments can raise taxes on whomever they please. In many countries, 
people with high incomes pay a greater share of their income in taxes than 
do people with low incomes.
What conflict theorists on both sides of this debate agree on is, though, that 
power is zero-sum: Whether the wealthy have it, or the beautiful people have 
it, or the government has it, someone has it — and that means that someone 
else doesn’t, or a lot of other people don’t.
Pluralist models: Fair is fair
The Marxist C. Wright Mills attacked the Durkheimian Talcott Parsons for 
having too rosy a view of society. Parsons thought that modern industrial 
society actually worked pretty well — in fact, better than any previous form 
of society — to meet people’s needs. When Mills accused Parsons of forget-
ting that a privileged few “power elite” were in charge of everything, and 
were bending everyone else to their will, Parsons snapped right back with 
some valid observations criticizing the Marxist view of power.
Parsons believed that power was not zero-sum: that giving power to some 
didn’t necessarily mean taking it away from others. How could that be? 
Parsons pointed out that there simply has to be someone in charge, or soci-
ety would descend into chaos and nothing would get done. If no one has the 
power to make decisions, then no decisions get made. When society is effec-
tively organized, choosing one person or group of people to give power to 
actually gives everybody more power over their collective situation.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
To understand how this works, think about a coxswain on a rowing team. 
The “cox” doesn’t row at all; they just sit at the end of the boat and coordi-
nate the rowing by calling out to the rest of the team. In a sense, the cox has 
“power” over the rest of the team in that they can tell the rowers what to do 
and when to do it — but everyone on the team understands that without a 
cox, the team’s rowing would be uncoordinated and they would be wasting 
a lot of effort. By giving power to the cox, all the team members gain power 
over their opponents; if each team member kept for themselves the “power” 
over when and how to row, the whole team would lose.
Of course, that’s all well and good when it comes to a rowing team whose 
members agree on what needs to be done (fast and efficient rowing), but does 
that view of power make any sense for large, complicated industrial societies? 
In situations where it’s far from clear what the best course of action is, won’t 
any leader be tempted to take the course of action that’s most rewarding for 
the people they like — or for the people who are paying them off?
That’s certainly a possibility, but Parsons also believed Mills was empirically 
wrong in saying there was a “power elite” working behind the scenes. When 
things aren’t going your way, it may seem like the world’s conspiring against 
you…but is it actually? If your boss yells at you, your dog pees in the house, 
and your son gets in trouble at school, does that mean they all had a secret 
meeting somewhere and decided to do everything they could to make your 
day miserable?
 
Political sociologists with a pluralist view of power point out that when you 
closely observe actual working societies, it’s rare to find power concentrated 
in the hands of a few, and — far from conspiring to work to their collective 
advantage — the people who are in positions of power often argue among 
themselves.
Consider all the different types of power people have in a contemporary 
society:
 
✓ Political power: Heads of state, members of a legislative body, mayors 
and aldermen — presidents, prime ministers, supreme leaders, queens 
and kings
 
✓ Economic power: Captains of industry, wealthy families — CEOs with 
princely salaries, people with vast property holdings, people with 
money stuffed in their mattresses
 
✓ Cultural power: Entertainers, artists, writers and thinkers — famous 
actors, bestselling authors, TV hosts
 
✓ Network power: Well-connected socialites and “power players” — 
agents, lobbyists, neighborhood gossips
 
✓ Human capital: People with special education, skills, or talents — 
engineers, professional athletes, good plumbers

 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
It’s sometimes the case that the people in these various domains agree with 
one another about which direction a society should go, but very often it’s 
not — and furthermore, the people within each domain rarely agree with one 
another! Within each of these domains of power, there’s a diverse spectrum 
of people with different interests and desires.
If this is starting to sound like everyone’s in a rowboat without a cox, that’s 
exactly — a pluralist might say — why society delegates authority to particu-
lar people to make particular kinds of decisions. In a well-functioning plural-
ist society, the decisions that end up being made at least roughly balance the 
needs of all the different people in that society. Some voices may be louder 
than others, but in the long run, most people get heard.
Is this actually how society works? Well, there are many different societies 
that work many different ways, and certainly in some cases the decisions that 
are made are hardly “plural” at all. There are dictatorships and other types 
of society where, in fact, the power is concentrated among a very few people. 
Many sociologists, though, believe that a pluralist model is a better model for 
the way the world actually works than a Marxist model is.
Median voter theory and “common sense”
The median voter theory, first formulated by 
economist Duncan Black, holds that where 
voter’s political preferences range along a 
continuum from very liberal to very conserva-
tive, in a two-party election candidates will end 
up gravitating towards the middle rather than 
taking extreme positions that risk alienating 
moderate voters. I was explaining this theory to 
a student once when a friend of mine, overhear-
ing, said, “Jay’s going to hate it that I’m saying 
this . . . but that sounds like a fancy name for 
simple common sense.”
She was right — I did hate it that she said that! 
Why? Because dismissing any theory about 
the social world as “common sense” suggests 
that it can’t be empirically tested. Sure, to an 
American used to a two-party system, the idea 
of a political spectrum running from right to left 
with two more or less centrist candidates sit-
ting in the middle seems very familiar, but there 
are all sorts of ways the median voter theory 
could be wrong — or, at least, incomplete.
For one thing, who’s to say the political spec-
trum runs from right to left? Where would a lib-
ertarian who’s socially liberal but economically 
conservative fall? What if voters’ views are 
more complicated than big government (lib-
eral) versus little government (conservative)? 
That would be hard for the median voter theory 
to explain.
And what if voters’ preferences don’t fall in a 
bell curve — what if there’s a big group of very 
conservative voters and a big group of very 
liberal voters, and few in the middle? What if 
voters abandon a candidate who strays too 
far from their ideals? What about third-party 
candidates — when do they make an impact? 
These are all questions that challenge or com-
plicate median voter theory; theories that seem 
like “common sense” aren’t always right.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Robert Dahl, a political scientist whose work is widely respected by sociolo-
gists, responded directly to C. Wright Mills in the 1950s and 60s. In Dahl’s 
most famous book, Who Governs?, he presented New Haven, Connecticut 
as a case study in pluralism. Dahl scoffed at the idea that any kind of secret 
cabal was running New Haven — instead, he argued, the city government did 
its best to balance the competing interests of all the different people it gov-
erned. Sometimes people felt slighted and got angry, sometimes people took 
advantage of others, but by and large, Dahl said, New Haven was a demo-
cratic city — “warts and all.”
Dahl and other pluralists believe that’s the way government works, at least in 
democratic societies: by helping large, diverse groups of people work in their 
own best interest.
Social Movements: Working for Change
In the perfect pluralist society, democratic voting and fair representation 
would be enough to bring about a system of laws and policies that appropri-
ately balance the interests of everyone in a society. It never quite seems to 
work out that way, though — in part because there is no such thing as a per-
fectly democratic society, and in part because many of the most important 
institutions in society are not governmental at all. For that reason, people 
often find it necessary to organize social movements to work as a group for 
the kind of changes they want to see.
In this section, I explain how social movements get off the ground and mobi-
lize supporters — and how and why they succeed.
Getting off the ground
A social movement, in the sociological sense, is more than just a bunch of 
people who say they want something: it’s an organized effort to achieve social 
change. Social movements can be very small, or they can be very large; they 
can be very successful, and they can be complete failures. Nonetheless, 
what all social movements have in common is that they represent concerted 
efforts to bring about social change. They typically represent people who feel 
that their voices are not being heard through other channels; that they don’t 
have the means to get through to the powers that be without an organized 
effort to make their demands known.
 
There are many different kinds of social movements, with many different kinds 
of goals. From community-organizing groups like ACORN to religious groups 
like the Christian Coalition to lawless groups like the Ku Klux Klan, a social 
movement is any group of people organizing to bring about social change.

245
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
Social movements often target governmental officials and agencies, but they 
sometimes also target corporations or influential individuals. Most social 
movements seek to raise public awareness of the issues with which they’re 
concerned; in fact, some social movements seek to do nothing but raise 
public awareness.
Social movements’ efforts may take many forms. Most social movements 
involve one or more of these efforts:
 
✓ Rallys, marches, and parades: Public gatherings to show the world how 
many people feel a certain way, and how strongly they feel it.
 
✓ Coordinated demands: Letters, e-mails, or other messages to the move-
ment’s target(s).
 
✓ Publicity: Advertisements, posters, graffiti, or other means of spreading 
a group’s message.
 
✓ Civil disobedience: Members of a group defying the law to show 
how strongly they feel about their cause, especially when their cause 
involves a law they find unjust.
Social movements do not necessarily have to be coordinated from the top 
down; in fact, most large social movements are diverse, with different orga-
nized groups working towards some shared goals and some different goals. 
Groups within a social movement may also disagree on the means of achiev-
ing a goal: For example, some groups may believe that violent vigilante efforts 
are justified and necessary whereas other groups believe that efforts should 
be exclusively peaceful.
So why do social movements arise? It’s a question sociologists have been 
studying for a long time, and the answer isn’t obvious. After all, everybody 
wants something in society, but not everybody is going to go down to City 
Hall and picket over it, write letters about it, or even tell anyone else how 
they feel about it. There are any number of grievances that exist in any given 
society; which ones turn into full-fledged social movements? There are at 
least two good answers to this question; they come from relative deprivation 
theory and resource mobilization theory.
Relative deprivation theory
One answer that seems to make sense goes by the name of relative depriva-
tion theory. According to relative deprivation theory, people are spurred into 
organized action when a gap opens up between what they think they deserve 
and what they are actually getting. In other words, if society is setting a group 
of people up to think that they ought to have something, but then doesn’t 
give it to them, they feel “relatively deprived” and are inclined to take their 
grievances to the streets.

246
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
As an example, think about the women’s suffrage movement of the late 19th 
century and early 20th century. In the United States (and in many other 
countries) at that time, there was a concerted movement by women — with 
the support of sympathetic men — to gain the right to vote. This effort 
definitively succeeded with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the 
Constitution, guaranteeing all women the right to vote.
That amendment, though, was not ratified until 1920 — and women had been 
without the guaranteed right to vote for all of American history up until that 
time. Why was there no major suffrage movement in the 18th century, or 
in the early 19th century? Certainly there were plenty of women who were 
unhappy about their lot during those times, but they didn’t form a major suf-
frage movement until later.
Relative deprivation theory would say that women didn’t organize a mass 
suffrage movement until they felt relatively deprived of the right to vote. As 
the 19th century neared its end, the idea that any group could be legitimately 
deprived of the right to vote was under increasing attack from all sides. 
Slavery had ended, and in many places people of all races could vote. (Jim 
Crow laws, sadly, kept African-Americans in many places from actually voting 
until decades later.) Women in certain other countries were gaining the right 
to vote in the late 19th century, and some U.S. states and territories were 
granting suffrage (that is, the right for women to vote) for elections within 
their jurisdiction.
All this meant that a woman in 1900 who was living in a state where she was 
unable to vote could read about plenty of other examples of women who did 
have the right to vote. A hundred years previous, in 1800, a woman unable 
to vote would not have been able to point to many examples of women who 
could legally vote — so though both the woman in 1800 and the woman in 
1900 were equally deprived of the right to vote, the woman in 1900 would feel 
more deprived.
A useful aspect of this theory is that it’s helpful for explaining why there are 
just as many social movements in wealthy societies as there are in poor soci-
eties. Objectively, people in some societies are more deprived than people in 
others — but what inspires social movements, according to this theory, is a 
sense of relative deprivation.
 
If relative deprivation theory still seems confusing, think about a child whose 
father spontaneously decides to buy him a one-scoop ice cream cone; now, 
think about a child who is given the same one-scoop cone while his sibling is 
given a two-scoop cone. Which child is more likely to get upset?
Resource mobilization theory
Many sociologists, though, feel that relative deprivation theory is not enough 
to explain how and why social movements arise. Not only are there just as 
many social movements in wealthy societies, note those sociologists, when 

247
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
you start counting them you realize that there are even more social move-
ments in wealthy societies than in poor societies. These sociologists — in 
fact, most sociologists studying social movements today — prefer a theory 
called resource mobilization theory, a term coined by sociologist Douglas 
McAdam.
Why? Because coordinating a social movement isn’t just about sharing a 
grievance. Just because a significant number of people feel deprived of some-
thing doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to get together and coordinate a social 
movement. For that to happen, they need resources such as:
 
✓ Leaders with the time to coordinate the group’s activities.
 
✓ Communication resources, like mailing lists, phone trees, computer 
networks.
 
✓ Money to buy advertisements and other attention-getting devices, as 
well as to buy other resources.
 
✓ Social resources, such as contacts in the government, the media, and 
other spheres of influence.
 
✓ Transportation resources, such as planes, trains, and automobiles.
Those resources are all more readily available in wealthy societies, so it’s 
easier for people to mobilize social movements in wealthy societies than in 
resource-poor societies. Resource mobilization also explains why certain 
groups within a particular society are able to generate social movements, 
whereas others aren’t. It’s not necessarily the case that people involved in 
big, elaborate social movements feel more aggrieved than the people whose 
grievances don’t lead to social movements — it’s just that some people are 
better able to access the necessary resources for a social movement than 
others are.
This way of thinking about social movements is especially popular among 
Marxists, who — as I explain in the previous section “Sharing (or Not Sharing) 
Power in Society” — are concerned about the impact of money and power 
on political outcomes. Marxists point out that it’s exactly the people who 
already have many advantages who are able to mobilize social movements to 
give themselves even more advantages, whereas the people with relatively 
few advantages — the people who have the most basis for demanding social 
change — are also the people with the fewest resources to mobilize social 
movements. That can lead to an unfair situation becoming even more unfair.
 
Think about how much easier it is to start a social movement now than it was 
before the development of the Internet. Before, you’d have to make phone 
calls or drop flyers to organize rallies; now, you can create a Facebook event 
and the word will spread like wildfire. This is an illustration of why sociolo-
gists emphasize the importance of resource availability in the generation of 
social movements.

248
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Rounding up the posse
If one question is how social movements get started, another question is how 
people become involved in them. Even in the case of large, widespread social 
movements, most people in a society — even most people who care greatly 
about a given issue — do not become involved. Why?
One answer comes from microsociology, and points to the importance 
of frames. As I note in Chapter 6, a “frame” is a definition of a social situ-
ation. What I think my role is in a given social situation — including how, 
and whether, I need to act — depends on the frame around that situation. 
Whether or not a person chooses to join an active social movement depends, 
at least in part, on whether or not the situation is framed as one that person 
has an interest in.
This becomes especially important when you consider the fact that some-
times the grievances social movements fight for are quite removed from 
the lives of the people whose support the movement needs. In the women’s 
suffrage example above, the aggrieved, deprived group is quite clear: it’s 
women. In other cases, it’s not so clear; to mobilize supporters, social move-
ments need to convince as many groups of people as possible that the move-
ment’s cause is something the groups have a stake in.
As an example, think about the animal rights movement. There are many 
different organizations involved in that movement, with different goals and 
methods, but the general goal is to end practices that harm or cause suffering 
to animals. To mobilize as many supporters as possible, the various groups 
involved in the animal rights movement place a number of different frames 
around the issue.
 
✓ To attract supporters who are concerned about the environment, advo-
cates portray animal rights as an environmental issue: raising animals 
for food, they point out, requires more resources and creates more pol-
lution than raising grains and vegetables does.
 
✓ To attract supporters who are concerned about their health, advocates 
portray animal rights as a health issue: eating vegetarian, they say, 
means you’ll be healthier.
 
✓ To attract supporters who are pet owners, advocates portray animal 
rights as a moral issue: they spread photos and videos of animals being 
mistreated to win the sympathy of people who would never want their 
pets to be treated that way.
 
✓ To attract people who are conscious of their social status, advocates 
portray animal rights as something it’s cool to be worried about: they 
have attractive people pose for ads — sometimes unclothed (“I’d rather 
go naked than wear fur”) — to suggest that caring about animal rights is 
something that hot, high-status people do.

249
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
Sometimes being mobilized into a social movement is simply a matter of 
having the issue framed in a way that is compelling to you.
Interestingly, sociologists have also found that it’s often the case that people 
active in social movements did not necessarily have strong pre-existing 
beliefs in line with the movement’s principles — that is, that belief may follow 
action rather than vice-versa.
In the late 1990s, sociologist Ziad Munson set out to study the U.S. movement 
to make abortion illegal. He knew that many millions of Americans believed 
that abortion was wrong under most or all circumstances, but he also noted 
that only a small fraction of those people became active in what was known 
as the “pro-life movement,” the organized movement to prevent abortion 
with the ultimate goal of making it illegal. Munson arranged a series of inter-
views with activists in the movement, seeking to understand what led them 
from being passive supporters of the movement to being active supporters of 
the movement.
He was surprised to discover that many of his supporters reported that before 
they became active in the pro-life movement, they had not had strong views 
on the issue at all — in fact, some even said that they would have considered 
Taking it to the extreme
The sociology department at Harvard is located 
in the same building as the psychology depart-
ment, and when I was in grad school the build-
ing would be given enhanced security when 
there were animal-rights protests in the Boston 
area. Why? Because the building supervisor 
was concerned, justifiably based on his past 
experiences, that ardent activists might try to 
break into the building and free the caged mon-
keys used for psychological experiments.
The supervisor’s fear demonstrates the fine line 
between agitating for social change and forc-
ibly bringing that change about. All major social 
movements, from the Civil Rights movement to 
the environmental movement, have involved 
some significant elements of lawlessness. 
Sometimes it’s fairly minor — say, occupying 
a college building to protest a tuition hike — 
and sometimes it escalates into outright armed 
rebellion.
Is violence in a social movement justified? That 
all depends on whether or not you agree with 
the movement’s goals. Does it work? Often, 
yes . . . but then again, it sometimes backfires 
and embarrasses more moderate members 
of the movement, especially when people get 
hurt. The decision to obey or defy the law in the 
course of a social movement will always be a 
matter of judgment.
Social movements can sometimes seem ridicu-
lous, and sometimes they invite ridicule by using 
humor or intentionally extreme methods to get 
their point across. Still, social change is a seri-
ous matter, and throughout history people have 
gone to extremes to bring about the changes 
they seek. Sometimes that may seem hard to 
justify, but at other times, doing too little seems 
even worse.

250
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
themselves “pro-choice” (that is, in favor of keeping abortion legal), and had 
switched their views after becoming active in the pro-life movement. What hap-
pened in these cases was that people typically became involved in the move-
ment through friends and family: licking envelopes or making signs to support 
someone they cared about. After they started participating in the movement, 
they found that their beliefs about the issue became much stronger — that 
they turned into dyed-in-the-wool advocates for the pro-life cause.
 
Even, it seems, when it comes to an issue as personal and where views are 
held, by many people, so strongly, people can more easily be induced to act 
than to believe; after they start acting, their beliefs may follow. For this 
reason, social movements may have as much luck going through personal net-
works and offering other incentives (even material rewards) for people to act 
as they’d have appealing to people’s fundamental beliefs.
What it means for a social movement 
to be successful
Some social movements quickly meet with success, some find success only 
after many years, and some social movements meet with no success at all. Is 
there any way to understand why some movements succeed and others fail?
With an eye to exactly this question, sociologist William Gamson studied sev-
eral dozen organizations involved in social movements. After careful study, 
he concluded that (you’ve heard this before!) it wasn’t quite that simple. To 
“succeed” or to “fail” can mean different things in different contexts.
Gamson offered at least four different outcomes that social movements can 
meet, depending on whether or not they’re accepted as legitimate organiza-
tions and whether or not their material goals are met. Here are the four out-
comes Gamson saw:
 
✓ Full response. When a movement is recognized as legitimate and 
achieves its goals, it’s unquestionably been a success. This is the kind 
of success that the Civil Rights movement has had after many years of 
struggle: Not only do African-Americans have the universal right to vote 
and to gain employment without discrimination, the movement’s leaders 
have been given much recognition. In the United States, Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day is a national holiday.
 
✓ Preemption. Social movements may experience bittersweet victories 
when they realize their goals but are not accepted as legitimate orga-
nizations or as welcome movements. Music fans who have organized 
digital file-sharing networks to pressure record companies to loosen 

251
 Chapter 13: The Rules of the Game: Social Movements and Political Sociology
copyright restrictions have met with some success — companies have 
lifted certain protective measures, and have pulled back from their ini-
tial strategy of prosecuting copyright violators — but nonetheless, those 
fans have never been recognized as acting legally or legitimately. In this 
way, the goal of their movement has been “preempted” by the record 
companies.
 
✓ Co-optation. This happens when a social movement wins recognition, 
but doesn’t actually meet its goals. Gay pride festivals are now major 
civic events in many cities around the world, but some gay rights activ-
ists believe that their movement has been co-opted: that governments 
are visibly welcoming to gay rights organizations even as they fail to 
actually grant the rights (for example, marriage rights) that the organiza-
tions demand.
 
✓ Collapse. When a movement fails to achieve its goals and fails to win 
recognition, it simply collapses. For example, the movement to re-legalize 
polygamy in the state of Utah has failed to either change the law or to be 
recognized as legitimate. There are still a number of people who prac-
tice polygamy, but they often do so secretly and have been unable to 
muster anything resembling a genuine social movement.
The success of a social movement is sometimes a matter of having a charis-
matic leader, sometimes a matter of successful framing and mobilization, and 
sometimes a matter of raw resources — but often it’s a matter of whether or 
not the society is disposed to accept the movement’s demands, and whether 
or not there’s a genuine opportunity for those demands to be met.
 
When it comes to understanding the success or failure of social movements, 
it’s handy to remember the Latin phrase carpe diem: “seize the day.” For a 
social movement to succeed, the time has to be ripe — that is, it has to be the 
right “day” — but the movement must also successfully mobilize supporters 
to fight for its cause. That is, the movement has to do its share of seizing.

Urban Sociology and 
Demographics: (Ain’t No) Love 
in the Heart of the City
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding urban society
▶ Changing neighborhoods
▶ Making cities happy and healthy for everyone
I
 don’t know about you, but I’ve never seen a sociology textbook that has a 
photo of a small town on the cover. Cover images tend to portray bustling 
cities with towering skyscrapers, sometimes with people moving so quickly 
they blur. Why is that? After all, a village is a society, too.
Urban life is at the heart of sociology. As you can read in Chapter 3, sociology 
was founded at a time when cities were growing rapidly as people moved in 
search of jobs and new opportunities. When they did, they would encounter — 
many for the first time in their lives — people from different religions, different 
races, different places.
When you’re among people who are similar to you, it’s easy forget about the 
fact that you’re all operating under a set of assumptions and expectations 
about the social world. In the city, there’s no getting around the fact that 
there are many different traditions and languages and ways of life: many of 
them are right in front of you when you walk down the street. It can easily 
make you curious about society, and about how all those different people can 
possibly get along together.

254
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
In this chapter, I begin by talking about classic sociological studies of the 
city. I then talk about urban change and diverse neighborhoods, and finally 
look to the future of the city. Can cities remain peaceful, productive places 
for everyone to live? Sociologists believe they can, but they acknowledge that 
there’s always going to be tension, always going to be diversity and change. 
That’s what urban life is all about.
Sociology in the City
Sociologists have always looked to the heart of the city for people and situ-
ations to observe. Urban life is enormously complex, and it will always be a 
challenge to understand how it works. (It’s often a challenge just to live it!) In 
this section, I explain how 19th century sociologists understood city life, and 
how 20th century sociologists threw themselves right into the thick of it.
The loneliness of a crowd
“The lonely crowd” is a cliché (and the title of a classic sociology book that 
actually has more to do with suburban life than with urban life), but it is one 
of the paradoxes of social life that being in a crowd of people can indeed be 
lonelier than being alone. Hundreds or thousands of people may be in the same 
place as you, but if don’t or can’t relate to them, it can feel very isolating — 
even frightening.
That’s a new feeling for people who move to big cities from small communi-
ties: the feeling of almost always being surrounded, even crowded, by people, 
but by people who don’t necessarily know or even care who you are or where 
you came from. On a bus or subway car, you may have your face jammed into 
the armpit of someone who’s completely ignoring you. For a number of rea-
sons, that’s not pleasant.
The sociologist who’s best known for writing about why it feels different to be 
in a city than in a small community was a German named Ferdinand Tönnies, 
whose most important work was published in the late 19th century.
In his book Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies explained what he saw as 
a difference between Gemeinschaft — a world usually translated into English 
as “community” — and Gesellschaft, which is usually translated as “society.”
For Tönnies, Gemeinschaft characterizes a community that feels like a com-
munity. It’s characteristic of a group you’re usually born into, and like other 
members of the community, you share many things in common. You natu-
rally feel a kinship with other people in Gemeinschaft because you have a set 
of shared interests and, for that and other reasons, you do many of the same 
things. Examples of groups bound by Gemeinschaft include:

255
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
 
✓ Farming communities
 
✓ Families
 
✓ Religious communities
Gesellschaft, on the other hand, characterizes a group of people who come 
together by choice, usually for very specific practical reasons. When you opt 
to move to a place or join a group because there’s something in particular 
that you want to accomplish — not necessarily because you feel any particu-
lar affinity for the other people in that group — the bond you share with the 
other people in that group is the impersonal bond of Gesellschaft. Examples 
of these groups include:
 
✓ Urban business centers
 
✓ Corporations and trade cooperatives
 
✓ Universities
 
✓ Political parties
In Gemeinschaft, when you encounter someone you can safely assume that 
he or she has a lot in common with you and is, or wants to, share a personal 
relationship — in other words, that he or she is your friend. In Gesellschaft, 
people are together for a very specific reason and may otherwise want noth-
ing to do with one another. In fact, in some such groups (for example, in 
business ventures), close personal relationships may be discouraged or even 
outright forbidden!
 
In Gemeinschaft, bonds among people are intimate and personal. In 
Gesellschaft, bonds are practical and impersonal.
Groups characterized by Gemeinschaft are generally much more comfortable, 
and if you ever read Tönnies’s writing, you may get the feeling that he pre-
fers Gemeinschaft and wishes there could be more of it. From a sociological 
perspective, though, Gemeinschaft isn’t something you can just put in a can 
like paint and spray wherever you think the world needs some peace, love, 
and understanding: it’s the result of living among people who have a lot in 
common with you. In most social situations today, the fact is that you just 
don’t have much in common with the people around you and it would be silly 
to pretend that you do.
When I was living in the Boston area, a neighbor from St. Paul — the quieter, 
less crowded city where I grew up — came to visit, and as we walked through 
downtown Boston he turned to me. “I keep saying hi to people,” he said, “but 
they don’t say hi back!” Were people in Boston less friendly than people in St. 
Paul? Yes, but for a reason. When you’re walking down a crowded city street, 
you’re continually passing people who you are not friends with and may 
never see again. If you stop to say hi to everyone, you’ll essentially be wast-
ing breath that could be saved for the people you are friends with.

Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Tönnies believed that society, over time, was increasingly characterized by 
Gesellschaft: it’s becoming more urban, more diverse, and more bureaucratic. 
All those things can make society feel less friendly and warm, but they’re 
happening for many reasons — including many good reasons — and short of 
some terrible disaster, the clock is unlikely to turn back (see Chapter 16 for 
more on social change).
Gesellschaft is something people are going to have to learn to live with . . . and, 
in fact, most people are doing so quite happily. Diverse urban life is full of sur-
prises: new people, new experiences, new ideas. Sometimes the surprises are 
nasty, but most people today have decided that urban life is worth that risk.
Street corner society
Look on any city street at any given time, and you’re apt to see people buzz-
ing about, going to and fro, jumping in their cars and hopping out of cabs, 
selling things, buying things, arguing, making out . . . it can be dizzying to see 
how much activity is going on at any given time. It may seem like there’s no 
pattern, no sense to be made of it at all.
Smile! You’re on candid (sociological) camera
William Whyte is a big name in urban sociol-
ogy: it was shared by two different men who 
both made major contributions to the discipline. 
William Foote Whyte was the sociologist whose 
participant observation was the basis for his 
classic book Street Corner Society; William H. 
Whyte was the author of The Organization Man 
(see the section “The rise and fall of the sub-
urbs”) and a pioneer in visual sociology, the use 
of cameras to document social life.
William H. Whyte and his team turned video 
cameras on a number of spaces in New York 
City, watching to see how people used the 
spaces. They made a number of fascinating 
findings, and they had the video evidence to 
back them up. (You can use a search engine 
to find their film The Social Life of Small Urban 
Spaces for viewing on the Internet.)
Even in the crowded city, Whyte and his 
team found many urban spaces were usually 
deserted; people flocked to a few busy plazas 
even when they were planning to sit alone. 
Why? Because the most common activity 
among people observed by Whyte’s team 
turned out to be — that’s right — watching 
other people. And, it turned out, people liked to 
be watched! Whyte expected smooching lovers 
to be found in private, secluded spaces, but 
most often they sat or stood right in the center 
of things for everyone to see. Further, people 
having private conversations would stand in the 
middle of the sidewalk, forcing people to step 
around them.
The next time you’re out and about in a big 
city, watch to see how people gather and use 
spaces. Even people who are “alone” really 
aren’t: They’re relating to all the people around 
them in ways that fit the circumstances of the 
city. 

257
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
Over time, though, if you watch carefully, patterns will emerge. You’ll notice 
the shopkeeper who always comes out for a smoke break at three specific 
times each day, the bus driver who helps the little old lady up the steps with 
her shopping cart each Tuesday morning, the kids who come home from 
school every weekday and pass by the musician playing his guitar. You’ll 
notice cops on a beat — and, maybe, criminals on their own beats. There are 
rules and regularities to even the most chaotic urban neighborhood.
Though many different research methods have been used to study urban life, 
the research method most closely associated with urban sociology has been 
ethnography: hitting the streets to talk to city residents and understand how 
their lives and relationships work. From the Chicago School on down (see 
Chapter 3), this has been an enormously productive pursuit that has yielded 
some of the most important studies in all of sociology.
One of the most famous studies is described in the book Street Corner Society 
by the great American sociologist William Foote Whyte. Over the course of 
several years in the 1930s, Whyte lived among the predominantly Italian-
American residents of an inner-city neighborhood in Boston. His careful 
study shows many of the complex aspects of life in that place at that time:
 
✓ The tension between neighborhood-oriented “corner boys” and the 
upwardly mobile “college boys.”
 
✓ Local politics, with officeholders and candidates for office working to 
win the allegiance of important individuals and families.
 
✓ The prevalence of organized (and disorganized) crime, with racketeers 
knit into the neighborhood’s social fabric.
The most memorable, and poignant, aspect of Street Corner Society is Whyte’s 
description of the complex relations among a gang of “corner boys”; he cap-
tured the way they had to balance their personal friendships and relation-
ships with complex social forces. Over Whyte’s years of observation, various 
boys’ fortunes rose and fell, and those boys in leadership positions faced 
hard choices about how to use their influence with their peers.
 
Books like Whyte’s — and, to be sure, there have been many more excellent 
studies along these lines — demonstrate the complex nature of urban life, 
even in communities that look desperate and disorganized. Many Bostonians 
dismissed the North End neighborhood where Whyte lived and worked as a 
“slum,” but Whyte’s book paints a complex picture: one that isn’t always 
pretty, but does show the strong webs of social organization present in the 
neighborhood.
Street Corner Society was also pioneering in Whyte’s use of the research 
method known as “participant observation,” in which the researcher joins 
a social group and participates in activities along with its members. (See 
Chapter 4.) The method has its drawbacks — it can be hard to objectively 

258
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
analyze a group of which you’re a part, which is something you know if 
you’ve ever tried to figure out your own family — but it’s hard to imagine 
that Whyte would have been able to paint so rich a portrait if he had stayed 
at arm’s length from the people he was hoping to understand.
Changing Neighborhoods
Cities aren’t static — they’re always changing. If you’ve lived in a neighbor-
hood even for a year, you’ve seen it change; and if you’ve lived there for 
longer, you’ve seen it change even more. Sociologists have long been inter-
ested in how and why neighborhoods change their character (and their 
characters). In this section, I explain how sociologists think about urban 
transformation.
It’s 10 PM. Do you know 
who your neighbors are?
Do you know who your neighbors are? Could you step out your front door, 
point at each house or apartment building, and say who lives there? When 
you walk down your street, do you know the names of the people you pass?
Based on sociological studies of neighborhoods, I’m going to guess that you 
probably don’t — and that you feel at least a little bad about it. TV shows, 
political campaigns, and Currier & Ives prints of community ice rinks send 
the message that your neighborhood is very important, and that your neigh-
bors ought to be your bosom buddies. Your parents may talk about how, 
when they were young, everybody knew and trusted everybody on the block, 
how if you misbehaved in front of the neighbor lady, she’d punish you just 
like your own mom would.
There are indeed many communities that are tightly knit, but there are many 
more that aren’t. Most people today don’t identify with their neighborhoods 
as being important to their identities; it’s just where they happen to live. 
They each probably know a few people who they happen to come across or 
who they’ve borrowed sticks of butter from, but they don’t really see their 
streets as being their streets.
The “good old days” shouldn’t be romanticized: people have always been 
mobile, and there has always been variety in the types of neighborhoods 
they’ve shared. In certain pockets, multiple families may have lived on the 
same city block for decades or even generations, but that kind of stability has 
never been universal, or even the norm — especially in urban neighborhoods 
as opposed to rural communities.

259
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
Some aspects of urban life, though, have indeed changed over the past sev-
eral decades:
 
✓ Transportation and communications technology allows people to have 
much more frequent and meaningful interaction than in the past with 
others who are far away, and though in general this supplements rather 
than replaces interaction with people who they see in person, it is cer-
tainly true that sitting on the porch and watching the world go by isn’t 
quite as compelling as it was 50 or 100 years ago.
 
✓ Immediate families are smaller and more independent than they once 
were.
 
✓ Rising wealth and living standards around the world mean less sharing 
of community resources — including housing. It was once common for 
families to host unrelated, paying boarders in their private homes; that 
practice is much less often seen today.
 
✓ From grocery shopping to entertainment, more activities are done at large 
urban or suburban centers and fewer are done at small neighborhood 
establishments. This is more efficient, and saves money for everyone.
 
✓ For a number of reasons (both parents working, increased participation 
in educational programs, safety concerns), children are much less fre-
quently encouraged to play in the areas directly outside their homes — 
especially unsupervised — than was formerly the case.
All these factors, and more, have contributed to the declining significance of 
neighborhoods as centers of activity. It’s very easy to know almost nothing 
about your neighbors — to come and go in your car and possibly even to 
live in a home for years without having any significant interaction with those 
living near you.
That said, it would be a mistake to think that this overall trend means that 
your neighborhood simply doesn’t matter any more!
There is tremendous variety among types of neighborhoods and types of 
communities. True, many neighborhoods are only loosely connected — but 
many neighborhoods are very tight-knit, with neighbors socializing and sup-
porting each other. This is true for different reasons in different types of 
neighborhoods. In relatively wealthy neighborhoods, residents may have 
more resources to communicate among themselves, to host events, and to 
mobilize around causes like street repair and public safety . . . but in less 
wealthy neighborhoods, residents may have more incentive to band together 
and support each other.
 
The importance of your neighborhood goes beyond just the influence of the 
people you share it with. Your neighborhood impacts your access to transpor-
tation, utilities, and other resources; it impacts your safety as well as your 

260
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
educational and work options; it may even directly impact your health if pollu-
tion or housing quality are significant factors. Those things are, in turn, 
affected by the people who live around you.
Neighborhoods on the tipping point
You don’t need a sociologist to tell you that neighborhoods change over 
time. What’s a little trickier is knowing how and why they change. Urban soci-
ologists have spent decades studying patterns of neighborhood change, and 
they’ve come up with some interesting theories about what’s going on.
The invasion-succession model: Make room, make room!
Sociologists in — and influenced by — the Chicago School likened neighbor-
hoods to biological ecosystems. Robert Park, a major figure in that crowd, 
espoused a model that became known as the invasion-succession model.
According to the invasion-succession model of neighborhood change, a neigh-
borhood — like a forest or a prairie — hosts a number of “species” that exist 
together in harmony. In my neighborhood in Minneapolis, for example, you 
might say that there is one social “species” of older, wealthy people who own 
large homes. With more space than they can use, they rent their extra rooms 
and carriage houses to members of a second social “species”: young, single 
adults who are upwardly mobile but don’t yet have the means or desire to buy 
their own houses. These two “species” exist together in harmony.
But what if a new “species” moved in — say, entrepreneurs who wanted to 
run businesses out of their houses? That might spur conflicts over parking, 
traffic, and the neighborhood’s historical character. Any of the following 
things might happen:
 
✓ The neighborhood might somehow find a way to accommodate this new 
“species” of resident.
 
✓ The current residents might band together to drive out the “invaders,” 
and the neighborhood would remain as it is.
 
✓ The entrepreneurial “invaders” might cause the longtime residents to 
move out, making more room for new business-oriented “invaders,” who 
would ultimately succeed the former residents and create a new local 
“ecosystem.”
This way of thinking about neighborhood change has been of great interest to 
sociologists hoping to understand transitions in neighborhoods’ racial com-
position. If a neighborhood has predominantly residents of one race, then if 
residents of another race move in, the existing residents may feel threatened 

261
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
and try to make the newcomers feel unwelcome; if more and more of the new-
comers move in, though, the neighborhood may reach a tipping point where 
the previous residents simply decide to leave.
This model of neighborhood change seemed to make a lot of sense in the 
early 20th century, when open racism was still common; in some ways it’s 
still useful today, whether it’s used to describe changes in neighborhoods’ 
racial composition (unfortunately, many neighborhoods are still racially seg-
regated, and residents of a different race may feel unwelcome) or changes 
in the occupation or income level of residents. Sociologists today, though, 
realize that neighborhood change happens for more reasons than simply 
because of “invaders” changing a neighborhood’s demographic composition.
 
For an interesting and controversial look at neighborhood change today, take 
a look at Bill Bishop’s book The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded 
America is Tearing Us Apart. Bishop believes that people’s tendency to move 
to neighborhoods where people share their political beliefs and cultural inter-
ests is damaging to the larger community because it means there’s less oppor-
tunity for exchange and dialogue. Others would argue that it’s for the better if 
people feel they have a lot in common with their closest neighbors. What do 
you think?
The life and death of neighborhoods
Another influential theory of neighborhood change was the “life cycle” 
theory, in which neighborhoods are thought of as being more like organisms 
themselves than like ecosystems.
The sociologists who invented the life cycle model believed that neighbor-
hoods went through repetitive cycles of change. First, a neighborhood would 
be developed, and people would start to move in. As it attracted more resi-
dents and more development, a neighborhood would enter its prime — but 
eventually, the neighborhood’s infrastructure would start to decay, the quality 
of life there would start to decline, and residents would move out in pursuit of 
newer, nicer neighborhoods. Eventually, the neighborhood would be in bad 
shape, and would need to be redeveloped, starting the cycle all over again.
This model makes a lot of sense: If you think about your own city, you can 
probably identify neighborhoods that seem to be in each of the “stages” of 
neighborhood life. There’s the shiny new suburban community or downtown 
development where everybody seems to want to move; there’s the vital neigh-
borhood with popular businesses and longtime residents; there’s the declining 
neighborhood where another business seems to close every day; and there’s 
the dangerous neighborhood where crime is frequent and where no one lives 
unless they can’t afford to live anywhere else. In the case of the latter neighbor-
hood, you have probably heard calls for “renewal” and “redevelopment.”

262
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
This way of thinking about neighborhood change acknowledges that urban 
life is more than just a big game of Risk, with “invading armies” of different 
groups trying to “take over” different neighborhoods. In fact, many of the 
healthiest, most vibrant neighborhoods have incredibly diverse social “eco-
systems” and can easily accommodate newcomers without making the long-
time residents feel threatened. The life cycle model also takes into account 
the importance of neighborhood infrastructure: building quality, local ser-
vices and amenities. It’s true that when buildings, streets, and other human-
made artifacts reach a certain age, they start to decay, and many people find 
it easier to just move away than to replace the old stuff.
Still, sociologists realize that this way of thinking about neighborhood change 
also has its limitations. Failed experiments in “urban renewal” (see sidebar 
“Out with the old and in with the new . . . for better or worse”) have made 
clear that you can’t just hit the restart button on a neighborhood — that 
neighborhood change is a complex process that involves location, infrastruc-
ture, demographic change, social networks, and many other factors.
The rise and fall of the suburbs
I teach at a college in Eagan, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul. Eagan is only a 
short drive from the central city; it’s green and hilly, parking is copious, and 
a big shopping area near the freeway has one of just about every big chain 
store you can name. Life is relatively easy in Eagan, and that’s why most 
Americans prefer to live in communities a lot like it.
Ever since there have been cities, there has been a market for housing at 
their outskirts, accessible to the commercial activity and entertainment in 
the cities’ centers but with more affordable space. Many inner-city residential 
neighborhoods started out as suburban areas when the cities were smaller, 
and older cities like London and New York City have inner-ring suburbs that 
are themselves hundreds of years old, with beautiful (and hugely expensive) 
historic houses.
Most neighborhoods that are now called “suburbs,” though, are products 
of the highway system, which allows people to drive great distances at high 
speeds. The highway system means that a person can reasonably commute 
to work in, say, St. Paul from not only Eagan, but from a city like Hugo — 
which is 20 miles away.
The suburbs built in the United States after World War II seemed to promise 
“the American dream”: on a single income (usually the father’s), a family could 
have a freestanding house with its own yard. For reasons of both efficiency and 
style, many suburbs built at that time — and since — have featured houses 
that are very similar in appearance.

263
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
Sociologists have always been fascinated by suburbs: Although it’s clear that 
many families find them highly desirable as places to live, sociologists have 
often been troubled by certain aspects of suburban life:
 
✓ In his bestseller The Lonely Crowd, sociologist David Riesman worried 
that suburban life was helping to turn Americans into “other-directed” 
people who did what everyone else was doing instead of what their 
“inner compasses” told them to do.
 
✓ Sociologist William H. Whyte made a similar argument in The Organization 
Man, which painted the suburbs as cookie-cutter neighborhoods where 
people lived bland, interchangeable lives.
 
✓ In The Levittowners, a study of the first new-model American suburb, 
sociologist Herbert J. Gans observed how racially and economically 
homogeneous the suburbs were, and wondered whether suburbs were 
contributing to social segregation.
Out with the old and in with the new . . . 
for better or worse
The life cycle model of neighborhood change 
(see section “The life and death of neighbor-
hoods” earlier in this chapter) inspired a wave 
of calls for “urban renewal” in the middle of the 
20th century. The idea behind urban renewal 
was that decaying or dangerous neighborhoods 
could be reinvigorated with massive invest-
ments in development. Sometimes this worked, 
but often it didn’t. In downtown Boston, a suc-
cessful example of urban renewal sits right next 
to an unsuccessful example.
Starting in the early 19th century, Boston’s 
Scollay Square neighborhood was a buzzing hub 
of commerce and entertainment — including, 
especially after 1940, the kind of “entertain-
ment” that involved women wearing lots of 
sequins and feathers with not much under-
neath. By the 1960s, the neighborhood was seen 
as seedy and was completely torn down; in its 
place went what is now called Government 
Center, a vast plaza that houses Boston’s City 
Hall and other government buildings. The devel-
opment has been widely criticized for replacing 
a vibrant neighborhood with a cold, windswept 
expanse where no one really wants to go.
Right across the street, though, an aging fish 
market next to the historic Faneuil Hall was 
turned into an outdoor shopping mall in 1976; 
the resulting Faneuil Hall Marketplace was 
instantly hailed as a triumph of urban renewal 
and has been packed with residents and tour-
ists ever since. People come from all over to 
stroll among inviting gift shops, entertaining 
street performers, and vendors selling seafood 
and other local specialties.
Why did Faneuil Hall Marketplace work so 
well in rejuvenating a troubled neighborhood, 
and Government Center fail? There are many 
answers, but one answer is that no one was 
displaced in the building of the marketplace. A 
lesson from Boston’s experiences is that just 
because a neighborhood strikes some people 
as unsavory doesn’t mean it’s “dying,” and that 
when a neighborhood is destroyed, you can’t 
grow a new one overnight no matter how much 
money you spend.

264
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
Sociologists also, however, acknowledge that residents of some suburban 
communities have social bonds that are very tightly knit — perhaps even 
too tightly knit. Whyte’s study of a growing suburban community in The 
Organization Man shows how many residents were kept almost dizzyingly 
busy with schedules of card games, church meetings, and other social func-
tions. Residents were able to rely on one another for everything from child 
care to a stick of butter to emotional support. Far from being isolating, the 
suburbs were intensely social. The suburbs’ relative homogeneity was both a 
cause and an effect of that aspect of suburban life.
At first, sociologists like Gans were concerned at the “white flight” repre-
sented by suburban growth, with relatively wealthy — often white — city 
dwellers abandoning urban neighborhoods for the shiny, safe suburbs. As 
those mid-century suburbs have aged, though, they’ve become less desir-
able and more diverse. Many well-to-do families have left older suburbs like 
Levittown; some heading for the newer, shiner “exurbs” that lie beyond the 
suburbs and others heading back into the city, where they contribute to the 
process of gentrification (see the section “Gentrification and the new creative 
class” later in this chapter).
 
Many post-war American suburbs are now populated by a diverse mix of long-
time residents and new arrivals priced out of their inner-city neighborhoods. 
Some are home to thriving enclaves of immigrants from places like Africa and 
East Asia. Though the houses may still be “cookie-cutter,” their residents are 
anything but.
Life in the City: Perils and Promise
As they have always been, cities are places of great hope, great promise, 
and — like any place — real dangers. Some people live in cities because 
they’ve always dreamed of being there, others find city life to be a night-
mare from which they can’t escape. In this section, I address the conflicts 
and tensions inherent in city life.
The upper class, the lower 
class, and the underclass
Diversity of all sorts is among the essential features of big-city life, but not 
all urban neighborhoods are particularly diverse. Some neighborhoods are 
primarily occupied by wealthy people who own lavish homes or high-rise 
condominiums, some are primarily occupied by working-class people who 

265
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
live in modest homes or rent decent but not luxurious apartments, and 
others are downright rough, occupied by people who wish they could afford 
to live elsewhere.
As I note earlier in the section “Changing Neighborhoods,” an essential 
insight of urban sociology is that your neighborhood isn’t just a place where 
you live, it’s a place that affects your life. Residents of expensive neighbor-
hoods don’t just get the nice, expensive house or apartment they’re paying 
for; they also get everything that goes with living in that neighborhood:
 
✓ Good schools
 
✓ Well-kept public spaces and parks
 
✓ Well-maintained roads and sidewalks
 
✓ Good police protection
 
✓ A thriving business community, with multiple shopping and dining 
options
Those things make easier the lives of people who already live in relative com-
fort. In theory, these things should all be available to all residents of a city — 
but in reality, poorer neighborhoods tend to lack those amenities. Residents 
of a poor neighborhood are likely relatively poor to begin with; in addition to 
having to get by with limited money, they suffer the disadvantages of living in 
a poor neighborhood:
 
✓ Overcrowded, understaffed schools
 
✓ Public spaces and parks that are not as accessible or well-maintained as 
those in wealthier areas of town, and that may sometimes play host to 
dangerous or criminal activities
 
✓ Roads and sidewalks that are poorly maintained
 
✓ A police presence that may be inadequate, hostile, or so overwhelmed 
with serious crimes that isn’t very responsive to ordinary residents’ 
concerns
 
✓ A depressed business community, with few job opportunities and lim-
ited shopping options
To find jobs, good schools, and reasonably priced consumer goods, residents 
of poor neighborhoods are often forced to travel long distances by car — or, 
if they can’t afford a car, by public transportation. At home, they may face 
physical danger and other challenges. Plus, they likely find it relatively dif-
ficult to make the social connections that will help them get up and out of 
poverty.

266
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
 
To describe these exceptionally challenging circumstances, sociologists 
sometimes use the term underclass. Sociologist William Julius Wilson, in his 
1987 book The Truly Disadvantaged, argued that members of the urban under-
class are those left behind when people who could afford to fled the city for 
the suburbs. As manufacturing jobs dried up in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, mem-
bers of the urban underclass were especially vulnerable and had a hard time 
maintaining steady employment, sometimes turning to crime, drug use, and 
other destructive activities.
Though a disproportionate share of the underclass are minorities, Wilson 
believes that the challenges of the underclass have less to do with racism 
than with simple economic realities. “White flight,” says Wilson, wasn’t just 
white flight — it was the flight of people of all races who could afford to leave 
the troubled inner cities. The disappearance of middle-class blacks might, 
in some ways, have created much more of a challenge for inner-city African-
American communities than did the disappearance of middle-class whites.
Gentrification and the new creative class
Elijah Anderson’s 1990 book Streetwise tells the stories of two neighboring 
inner-city communities: “Northton,” a predominantly black neighborhood 
plagued with low employment, high crime rates, poor health, and other prob-
lems; and “the Village,” a diverse neighborhood that’s on the upswing.
Many Northton residents could be described as members of the underclass, 
and Anderson notes that the community is home to fewer and fewer role 
models as the guru-like “old heads” of the neighborhood die, move out, or are 
simply marginalized as young people in the community fall under the sway of 
less constructive influences. By contrast, Anderson’s Village neighborhood is 
steadily becoming wealthier — and whiter. The challenge faced by the Village 
is the challenge of gentrification.
The word “gentrification” is derived from the word “gentry,” which describes 
wealthy landowners in traditional European society. Gentrification is the pro-
cess by which neighborhoods become steadily wealthier, especially inner-
city neighborhoods that have long been relatively affordable.
If you live in a city, you’ve seen gentrification happening, even in you 
haven’t heard the process called by that name. Think about a neighborhood 
in your city where the “creative types” have been moving — the artists, the 
single professionals, the people who enjoy living where “the action” is. It 
may be a working-class neighborhood, it may be a “tough” neighborhood 
downtown. The new residents move there because it’s affordable and 

267
 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
conveniently located, but as more and more well-educated people with rela-
tively high incomes move into the neighborhood, you start to see the signs 
of gentrification:
 
✓ “Hip” bars and coffee shops
 
✓ Art galleries and theaters
 
✓ New construction, including housing renovations and expansions
These things all serve to, over time, increase the desirability of the 
neighborhood — which makes houses and apartments there more valuable, 
which makes them more expensive to buy or rent. This can create tension 
between the new residents and the longtime residents, who not only see the 
character of their neighborhood changed, but also find themselves increas-
ingly priced out of their own communities.
Neighborhoods have always gone up and down in value over time, but gentri-
fication has particularly been a concern among sociologists and urban plan-
ners over the past few decades, as inner-city neighborhoods have become 
more desirable to what Richard Florida, a scholar of urban life, calls “the 
creative class.”
According to Florida, members of the “creative class” are becoming increas-
ingly central to economic life in developed countries. As manufacturing 
jobs move overseas, life in countries like Germany, the United States, and 
Australia is increasingly dominated by people who essentially think for a 
living. They may be software engineers, businesspeople, artists, or film-
makers. What they have in common is that they thrive in diverse, dense 
communities that give them many opportunities for intellectual and social 
stimulation. Where do they find these communities? Often, in inner cities.
Are those inner cities ready for the creative class? Ready or not, here they 
come.
Order and disorder on the streets
Chances are that today, your city looks a lot like mine, Minneapolis.
 
✓ There’s a central city that’s home to important economic, political, and 
cultural institutions; within that city there are pricey residential neigh-
borhoods, hip “up and coming” neighborhoods, sturdy working-class 
and middle-class neighborhoods, neighborhoods home to large (and 
growing) immigrant populations, and “tough” neighborhoods where you 
don’t want to spend too much time after dark.

268
Part IV: All Together Now: The Ins and Outs of Social Organization 
 
✓ There are affordable inner-ring suburbs where life is often still regarded 
as “nice,” but not as nice as it was in the 1950s, when they were the 
place to be. They’re still a place to be, but not the place to be.
 
✓ There are exurbs, where young families and older retirees move when 
they want the space and comfortable safety that the inner-ring suburbs 
once offered. Much of the city’s new-home construction is happening here.
People often move to the exurbs and suburbs because they seem safe, and 
in some ways they are: Though suburbanites have their share of problems, 
crime rates are generally lower in the suburbs. Most importantly, though, the 
suburbs feel safer.
What is it that makes a neighborhood feel safe? What is it that makes a 
community feel like a place you want to live, or don’t want to live? Why are 
crimes so much more frequent in some neighborhoods than in others?
In Chapter 2, as an example of a sociological study that’s helped policy-
makers find out what “really matters,” I cite a study by Robert J. Sampson 
and Stephen Raudenbush that surprisingly challenged the idea that small 
signs of seeming disorder in a neighborhood — for example, broken win-
dows in houses — cause people to think those are lawless places where 
anything goes. It is true, found Sampson and Raudenbush, that people are 
more likely to commit crimes in places they perceive to be “disordered,” 
but they judge urban disorder not by the condition of windows and walls 
but by the people they see there. Specifically — and unfortunately — they 
tend to associate a significant minority presence in a neighborhood with 
“disorder.” (In fact, this holds true even for observers who are themselves 
members of minority groups.)
Of course, all cities are disordered to some extent; that’s part of their 
appeal. In his book The Geography of Nowhere, social critic James Howard 
Kunstler observes that what makes cities exciting for some — and scary for 
others — is that, unlike in a suburban community, when you walk down a 
city street you have no idea who you’re going to run into. If you live in the 
city, you’re going to have at least glancing interactions every day with a 
lot of people who are quite different from you and whom you may see only 
once in your life.
What should a city look like? Kunstler is a proponent of a philosophy called 
“New Urbanism.” He and other New Urbanists believe that cities worked best 
before they were so sharply divided into commercial and residential zones, 
when urban areas had a mix of uses. They tend to favor:

 Chapter 14: Urban Sociology and Demographics
 
✓ Affordable housing integrated with more expensive, luxurious housing.
 
✓ Housing integrated with commercial establishments — for example, 
apartments above stores.
 
✓ Pedestrian-friendly public plazas.
 
✓ Accessible, affordable public transportation.
Can New Urbanism bring diverse, lively environments to the inner city? 
In some cases it’s worked, but in other cases — for example, a Disney-
sponsored New Urbanist city called Celebration — it’s fallen flat.
 
New Urbanism may be a useful way of thinking about successful city spaces, 
but whether or not the Chicago School sociologists were 100 percent right in 
thinking of cities as “ecosystems,” it’s clear that successful neighborhoods are 
like successful natural ecosystems: They’re hard to build from scratch, they’re 
tremendously valuable, and they’re surprisingly fragile.

n a recent production of J. B. Priestley’s play When We Are Married at the 
Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, audience members enjoyed the story 
of three couples who were married on the same date in 1883 meeting to 
celebrate their shared 25th anniversary. The actors were, or were made to 
appear to be, in their 60s. No one except me seemed to find that peculiar — 
but they should have! Why? Because in 1883, the average age of marriage for 
women was under 21. The actors should have been in their 40s!
As with all other social norms, it’s easy to assume that the way things are in 
your society is the way they’ve always been, or the way they are everywhere 
else. That’s rarely true, though; and it’s especially not true with respect to 
the timing and progression of steps through the life course. Different people, 
at different times and in different places, have had widely varying ideas about 
what makes “a good life.”
In this chapter, I explain how the life course itself is socially constructed. 
First, I discuss the social construction of age (at both ends of the spectrum, 
childhood and old age); then, I explain how demographers study the life 
course. Finally, I explain how sociologists study the always-timely issue of 
health care, and how family life has changed over time.

274
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
The Social Construction of Age
Age itself isn’t socially constructed — the body’s basic life cycle is the same 
for all people, everywhere. To say that “age” is socially constructed is to say 
that people’s ideas about what is necessary and appropriate for people at 
each stage of life varies from place to place and from time to time. In this sec-
tion, I explain how ideas of childhood and old age have varied, and continue 
to change.
The “invention” of childhood
A historian named Phillippe Ariés made headlines (well, academic headlines) 
in the 1960s with his bold assertion that the idea of childhood was “invented” 
in the Middle Ages. According to Ariés, before that point in history, people 
didn’t think of kids as being all that different from adults: They were just a 
little smaller. As soon as possible, kids became involved in the economic and 
productive life of society; they weren’t regarded as needing any kind of spe-
cial treatment just because they were below a certain age.
Historians today agree that Ariés overstated his case by a long shot, that the 
essential dynamic of family life — with parents loving their children tenderly, 
sometimes coddling them while also often encouraging them to do chores 
and achieve tasks — has been just about the same since the beginning of his-
tory. Still, Ariés was on to something: For most of human history, childhood 
wasn’t nearly as distinct from adulthood as it is now. Think about the ways 
that children today are regarded as being different than adults:
 
✓ Children cannot legally vote, sign contracts, or take independent respon-
sibility for themselves — rights that are guaranteed to all adults.
 
✓ Children are not allowed to work for pay (except for teenagers, within 
strict limits), and they are forced to attend school.
 
✓ Children are seen as being especially vulnerable and innocent, and are 
in need of shelter from the dangers of the world.
For much of human history, none of those things were seen as being true. 
Until very recently — a couple hundred years ago — most children did not 
attend grade school, let alone high school. They were needed to help sup-
port their family by working on the family farm (or, later, in factories), and 
the skills they’d be learning in school (even reading and writing) were seen 
as luxuries, not necessities. As for their innocence . . . many people, including 
the Puritans who settled America, believed that children were fundamentally 
sinful, and were in need of strict discipline to mold them into responsible 
adults.

275
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
Interestingly, along the way children acquired some specific rights that they 
did not previously have. Today, children in most countries have the right to 
seek legal protection (or to have protection sought for them) if their parents 
or guardians abuse or overwork them. Plus, it’s increasingly the norm in 
educational and family settings to allow children a lot of say in what they do 
and when. (“Would you like to play in the block area or in the art area? What 
book do you want to read? Where do you want to go today?”) That’s much 
different than when children were meant to be seen and not heard.
Why the change? Has society simply become more . . . enlightened? Well, yes, 
but it’s also true that the seismic social changes that gave birth to modern 
society (and to sociology — see Chapter 3) changed the place of children in 
society.
As a society develops, industrializes, and urbanizes, it eventually undergoes 
what demographers (people who study trends in population) call a “demo-
graphic transition.” At that time, both mortality (death rates) and fertility 
(birth rates) fall steeply: Fewer people are born, and they live longer. This 
happened in the United States and in Europe between 100 to 200 years ago.
After a demographic transition, there are fewer children around, and 
because they live in a (relatively) high-tech, industrializing society, they 
need to go to school for many years before they can be productive mem-
bers of society. This means that they need to be supported by their parents 
for many years — instead of supporting their parents through their work, 
as was formerly the case. Is it any surprise, then, that most parents have 
fewer children than they used to?
So the children who do come along are bigger deals than they used to be. 
They’re not loved any more than they used to be — parents throughout 
history have always loved their children — but they are the focus of more 
schooling, more money, and much more attention. That is new, and that is 
the main reason why childhood today is so much different than childhood 
was just a few hundred years ago.
Are kids today spoiled? If being “spoiled” means being doted upon by overly 
accommodating adults, then that’s a matter of judgment. If being “spoiled,” 
though, means being guaranteed an education and protected from forced 
labor . . . then yes, they’re spoiled rotten.
 
To understand the profound difference between childhood today and child-
hood just over a century ago, consider that in the late 19th century — as soci-
ologist Viviana Zelizer has pointed out — parents were invited to insure their 
children’s lives to compensate the family for income deceased children would 
have made had they survived. Today, by contrast, the cost of raising and edu-
cating a middle-class child in the United States can exceed $250,000. Children 
may represent a “net gain” emotionally, but certainly not financially!

18 again: The new senior citizens
Just as the earliest stages of life have been changing rapidly in recent years, 
so have the later stages.
People in the final decades of life have always been an important part of soci-
ety, serving as leaders and mentors and supporting younger people as they 
raise children and take up leadership positions. A number of changes over 
the past century, though, have completely transformed seniors’ experiences 
and essentially created an entire new stage of life.
For one thing, there’s simply much more of life than there used to be. My 
grandma will occasionally include in her e-mails and letters statements like, 
“I’m 89!” She seems almost surprised to still be alive — and no wonder. She’s 
already lived over 30 years longer than most other American girls born in 
1919. Grandma’s great-granddaughter, though — my niece Madeline, born 
Dad, can I take the car?
Anyone who’s read Jane Austen’s Pride and 
Prejudice, or seen a film adaptation of the story, 
has an idea of how courtship worked before 
the 20th century. Couples got married without 
ever exactly “dating”: They would make each 
other’s acquaintance in public settings, and 
if the match was deemed suitable (at least by 
their families, and ideally by the members of 
the couple as well), they’d become engaged 
and that was that.
What you did as a teenager may have surprised 
your parents, but it would have really mortified 
your great-great-great-grandparents. There’s 
still some controversy around whether or not 
teenagers should have sex, but just about 
everyone agrees that it’s proper for there to be 
a stage of life during which young people go 
about independently with members of the oppo-
site gender (or, now, whichever gender they’re 
attracted to), hang out with friends, be alone 
together, and at least do a little smooching.
Modern adolescence was born in the early 
20th century, as attending high school became 
widespread and technology (notably, the 
automobile) gave young people a measure of 
independent mobility. The whole commercial 
culture of adolescence — from soda fountains 
to school dances to youth fashions — sprang 
up around that time.
Ever since then, “adolescence” has been 
expanding to fill more and more of the life span. 
Today, 12-year-olds often act like 16-year-olds — 
running around at all hours and having a series 
of boyfriends or girlfriends — but so do 30-year-
olds! A major reason for this is the increase 
in college and grad school attendance, with 
many people taking until their mid-20s or even 
their 30s to finish schooling and settle down to 
begin a career. It’s hard to do homework when 
you have a toddler walking around . . . just ask 
anyone who’s tried!

 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
in 2007 — can reasonably expect that she and most of her peers will easily 
reach the age of 80. Further, medical advances have dramatically improved 
the quality of life for older people.
Additional social changes that have changed the experience of being past 
“middle age” (whatever that is) include:
 
✓ Economic changes that have made things both easier and harder for 
senior citizens. On the one hand, jobs relying on experience and knowl-
edge rather than physical endurance have become more plentiful and 
lucrative; but on the other hand, economic tumult means that more and 
more seniors find themselves unexpectedly out of work — and possibly 
facing age discrimination (see Chapter 8) when they apply for new jobs. 
Further, Baby Boomers have now reached what used to be considered 
“retirement age,” but many are finding themselves without the pension 
plans their parents had and thus forced to continue working, at least 
part-time.
 
✓ Childbearing changes have meant that people are having children later 
and later — in some cases, even after age 40. This means that not infre-
quently, people reach their 60s still supporting their children in college 
or grad school. With a predominance of two-earner families, grandpar-
ents also find themselves more essential to the day-to-day care of their 
grandchildren than they would have been 50 years ago.
 
✓ Changes in relationships — including a divorce rate around 40 percent — 
and reproductive technology (yes, Viagra) have meant that more and 
more seniors are dating and leading active sex lives.
All this adds up to a very different experience for today’s seniors than their 
parents and grandparents had. The title of this section — “18 again” — is 
tongue-in-cheek, but it’s not a joke. Seniors today often lead lives with a mix 
of work, family responsibilities, romance, and recreation that’s not dissimilar 
to the kind of life a teenager or college student leads. (In fact, increasing num-
bers of seniors are going back to school and becoming college students.) The 
only differences? Seniors go to bed earlier . . . and do more drugs.
This sounds like fun, and that’s absolutely true: Whether living indepen-
dently, with friends or relatives, in retirement or assisted-living communities, 
or in nursing homes, seniors today are leading notably exciting, fulfilling 
lives. Though people over 50 didn’t grow up with the Internet, they’ve 
learned quickly and are fueling much of the growth of social networking sites 
and other online communities.
It’s also true, however, that seniors today face a historically unique set of 
stressors. With families being small and economic times being tight, seniors 
can’t count on their children to support them — in fact, they’re having to 

278
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
support their children for unprecedentedly long periods of time. Most of 
them have not had life-long jobs, and robust pension plans or retirement sav-
ings accounts are fewer and fewer. Government subsidies help, but are hard 
to live on. What this means is that not only are seniors able to live active 
lives, many of them have to live active lives — they need the income. Being 
able to be up and at ‘em and on the job every morning when you’re 70 is 
great, but being forced to is not.
 
Social scientists project that over the next few decades, the number of 
people age 65 and over will grow at three times the rate of the population 
generally — so seniors are going to become a bigger and even more impor-
tant part of society.
Running the Course of Life
From a sociological perspective, understanding the life course doesn’t 
just mean understanding what happens over the course of a life; it means 
understanding when it happens. In this section, I explain how sociologists, 
demographers, and other social scientists study the incidence and timing of 
life-course transitions.
Demographics and life transitions
Demographics is the study of population patterns — in other words, the 
study of how populations of different groups of people grow, shrink, and 
move over time.
If you’re interested in TV, you may have heard the term used in connection 
with ratings. TV producers pay close attention to the demographics of their 
audience because they need to report that information to their advertisers. 
Here are the kind of information advertisers want to know:
 
✓ How many people watch a program?
 
✓ Where do they live?
 
✓ How old are they?
 
✓ Are they men or women?
 
✓ Are they married or unmarried?
 
✓ How much money do they make?

279
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
This is important information for advertisers because they want to target 
their products: If you manufacture pantyhose, you probably don’t want 
to advertise on a program watched mostly by men — unless they’re drag 
queens or bank robbers.
Demographic information is also essential, however, for many other orga-
nizations. Governments need to know how many representatives to assign 
to a state (the primary purpose for the U.S. census), as well as where to put 
libraries and mailboxes and swing sets. Corporations need to know where 
to open new electronics stores, bakeries, and day care centers; and non-
profit organizations need to know where to focus their efforts to support 
single mothers, or elderly Lutherans, or people with HIV. Demographic data 
are also, of course, very important to sociologists as well as other social 
scientists.
Demographers, and sociologists interested in demography, tend to be par-
ticularly interested in life-course transitions. Those are the points at which 
people transition from one stage of life to the next. Some transitions (aging, 
for example) are gradual, but most are quite abrupt: Even if they’re a long 
time coming, they happen more or less instantly. Important life-course transi-
tions include:
 
✓ Birth
 
✓ Completing stages of education (grade school, high school, college, grad 
school)
 
✓ The beginning of labor-force participation (in other words, getting a job)
 
✓ The start of dating and sexual activity
 
✓ Moving out of one’s parents’ household
 
✓ Childbearing
 
✓ Cohabitation (moving in with a romantic partner)
 
✓ Marriage
 
✓ Divorce
 
✓ Death
Gathering data on these can be tricky; some are matters of public record, but 
others need to be gathered with surveys or other techniques (see sidebar, 
“Counting and recounting”). These are the essential signposts of life, though, 
and with these transitions come enormous changes in people’s activities and 
goals. Having accurate demographic data is invaluable for understanding 
how communities work — and how they change over time.

Different shapes of the circle of life
The average American man graduates from high school at 18, moves out of 
his parents’ house at age 22, gets married at age 27, and has his first child at 
age 32. Does that describe any actual American man you know? It might, but 
it probably doesn’t. Those are averages calculated from data on many thou-
sands of men, but each individual American man follows his own course.
So do those averages mean anything at all? Absolutely. They describe the 
normative life course in American society. They describe the typical path of 
life for American men, and they’re roughly equal to the averages seen in simi-
lar countries. Americans know about what those averages are, and men know 
that if they go through those transitions earlier or later than average — or 
not at all — they’re unusual.
Counting and recounting
When you hear someone tell you that “the 
population of Boise is 205,314,” or “the aver-
age Canadian male has first sexual intercourse 
at age 16,” or “700 million people watched the 
Oscars,” do you ever wonder how the heck they 
know that? You should. Demographic data are 
gathered by a variety of means, none of them 
perfect.
It may seem easy to call someone up and ask 
how old he or she is, but in actuality surveys are 
hugely expensive — and the better they are, 
the more expensive they get. The U.S. census 
aspires to survey every single American resi-
dent, but it’s impossible to reach that goal. The 
Census Bureau itself estimates that it missed 
over six million people in the 2000 census . . . 
and that’s just for the bare headcount. More 
detailed demographic information comes from 
the census’s long form, which was intentionally 
only sent to about 16 percent of households. 
That doesn’t mean the long form data are inac-
curate, but it does mean that there’s greater 
room for error there — and there’s even more 
room for error in smaller, privately administered 
surveys.
Among surveys commonly used by sociologists, 
the number of respondents range from tens of 
thousands at the high end — larger sample 
sizes are highly unusual, especially when data 
are detailed — to mere hundreds at the low 
end. Many sociological studies derive from 
just a few big surveys where data are publicly 
available; few sociologists have the resources 
to survey thousands of respondents.
As I explain in Chapter 4, having a relatively 
small sample size doesn’t mean that data are 
inaccurate, just so long as the group you man-
aged to survey is actually representative of 
the population you want to study. That’s easier 
said than done (and as you can see by the 
last sentence, it’s not even that easily said). 
Statisticians have developed some extremely 
impressive tools for analyzing data, but when 
someone throws a bunch of demographic data 
at you to prove his or her point, it’s not a bad 
idea to read the fine print.

281
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
Of course, “American men” is a vast group, comprising well over 100 million 
people. It includes white working-class men in Philadelphia, Latino architects 
in Miami, black dentists in Oregon, and Asian farmers in California. Each of 
those groups has its own averages, and for various reasons they’re all differ-
ent. Demographers, and sociologists interested in demography, spend a lot of 
time trying to figure out how life course transitions are different among differ-
ent groups of people, as well as why they’re different and when they happen 
for each group. This may include asking questions like:
 
✓ Why do people whose parents are college graduates become financially 
independent at a later age than people whose parents are not?
 
✓ Why do women typically marry at a younger age than men?
 
✓ Why do divorce rates vary among races and ethnicities?
 
✓ Why do people in some states retire at earlier ages than people in other 
states?
 
✓ Why are small towns typically populated by older people than are big 
cities?
Just starting to think about what the answers to these questions might be, 
you can see how life course transitions are deeply tied to all other aspects of 
society. The average age of, say, marriage is tied to a range of things includ-
ing education, dating and courtship practices, the economy, and the law. If 
it varies — as it does — from group to group, that’s typically for a range of 
good reasons, and it falls to sociologists and other social scientists to sort 
those reasons out.
Because the sequence and timing of life transitions varies among social 
groups, that means it varies from place to place, from society to society, and 
from time to time. Another task that keeps sociologists and demographers 
busy is figuring out why those transitions vary over time. As I note in the 
introduction to this chapter, people today marry several years later than 
they did in the fairly recent past . . . why? Since 1883, the shape of life has 
changed . . . and it will continue to change.
 
The very nature of life course transitions changes over time. Transitions that 
may seem momentous and universal at one time and in one place may disap-
pear as important life markers, and others may arise.
Retirement, for example, was not too long ago regarded as a hugely signifi-
cant life transition. When a man or woman had finished a successful career, 
they stopped working and commenced to spend the rest of their life on pur-
suits they chose, living off retirement savings or a pension. Today, that life 
transition is disappearing. More and more people are working throughout 
their lives, and changing companies or even changing careers as they do so. 

282
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
The number of people who officially “retire” after multiple decades at one 
company (or in one career) is declining, so young people today don’t expect 
to “retire” as their grandparents did. One result of this is that they’re less 
likely, among other things, to save money for retirement.
A life course transition that’s becoming increasingly common, on the other 
hand, is cohabitation. Just a few decades ago, a couple who lived together 
before marriage was seen as exceptional, and “shacking up” was something 
you might not even talk openly about. In some circles, that’s still the case; 
but increasingly, cohabitation is a normal step in relationships that may 
or may not lead to marriage. In acknowledgement of this as well as of the 
increasing prevalence of couples who openly live together in same-sex rela-
tionships, invitations to events are now more likely to say “partners invited” 
than “spouses invited.” Cohabitation is becoming a newly common transition 
in the ever-changing life course.
Taking Care: Health Care and Society
No matter what bad things happen to members of our family, my grandma 
has a single response: “At least you have your health!” Not just for her, but 
for many people, health is the fundamental concern in life: Without your 
health, it’s hard to enjoy anything else. Further, it’s a family concern: Your 
health can affect your employment, your mobility, your life expectancy, and 
many other aspects of your life that have a profound bearing on your family.
Sociologists have found, however, that “health” can mean different things to 
different people — and that providing health care is a matter of making hard 
decisions, both for individuals and society. In this section, I explain why.
Deciding what counts as “healthy”
It may seem absurd to think of health as something that’s socially con-
structed. After all, a broken arm is a broken arm, no matter what society 
you’re in. That’s of course true, but if you’re asked whether or not you’re 
“healthy,” you could answer that question in many ways, and in doing so 
you’ll consider what is normally considered healthy in your society.
Even if I make the question more specific and ask whether you need treat-
ment for a health concern, your answer will vary depending on what treat-
ment options are available to you and your family. Think about all these 
different examples of people seeking medical treatment:

283
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
 
✓ A 69-year-old woman has ovarian cancer and goes with her husband to a 
clinic to receive chemotherapy.
 
✓ A 41-year-old man has an appointment with a counselor to talk about 
emotional problems he’s been having since the end of a relationship.
 
✓ After starting a new relationship, a 26-year-old woman visits her gyne-
cologist to request a prescription for birth control pills.
 
✓ A 12-year-old boy has broken his collarbone skateboarding, and his 
mother takes him to the emergency room to have the bone set and a 
cast put on.
 
✓ A 52-year-old man goes to his dentist to have a root canal performed.
 
✓ A 37-year-old woman is having back pain after childbirth and receives 
acupuncture to relieve the pain.
Those are all legitimate health issues, but they would have been treated 
very differently — or possibly not at all — in different places and times. 
Why does the definition of what counts as “healthy” change over time and 
from place to place?
One obvious factor that changes is technology. As the ability to treat health 
issues grows, the bar for what counts as “healthy” goes up. Today, medical 
professionals have the ability to replace missing teeth, excise unwanted fat 
deposits, do full-body cancer scans, and perform thousands of other treat-
ments that would have been impossible just a few decades ago. This means 
that the number of different health issues any given person can be treated for 
at any given time has grown significantly. That’s not to say any given family 
can necessarily afford to have those things treated or would choose to have 
them treated, but the possibilities are there.
Another aspect of health that varies, though, is a society’s — and a family’s — 
notion of what lifestyle and bodily state corresponds to the picture of “health.” 
Having conspicuously visible fat in the belly and elsewhere has been regarded 
in many societies as being especially healthy; in most societies today, it’s con-
sidered healthier to be on the thin side rather than the heavy side. This is a 
result of changes in:
 
✓ Knowledge: Medical professionals today understand that being obese 
increases one’s risk of heart failure and other health problems.
 
✓ Material circumstances: Because of changes in agriculture, transporta-
tion, and food-processing technology, it’s now more expensive to eat 
a healthy diet of vegetables than to eat a poor diet of junk food. Thus, 
being thinner is an indicator of greater wealth.
 
✓ Culture: Prominent opinion-makers in the media and in social networks 
have promulgated the idea that thinness is attractive.

284
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Mental health is an area where attitudes particularly vary among societies. At 
the extreme, mental states like schizophrenia that may be regarded as dan-
gerous or unhealthy in some societies may be regarded as special or blessed 
in others; short of that, though, opinions may vary widely from one society 
to the next about whether it’s desirable to seek treatment for depression, 
attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, or anxiety. Even within a given 
society, different individuals may have strikingly different views on those 
matters. (See sidebar, “Is ADHD socially constructed?”)
 
When families are making decisions about health care, they are influenced by 
the attitudes in their society — and, if they have immigrated, in the society 
from which they came — as they decide whether to pursue preventative medi-
cine, emergency medicine, traditional or holistic medicine, or nothing at all. 
Is ADHD socially constructed?
After decades of debate, psychologists have 
arrived at a definition of a disorder now called 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
a condition in which individuals experience 
inattentiveness and/or impulsive behavior to 
an extent that interferes with their daily lives. 
Common treatments for ADHD include medica-
tions like Ritalin that often help increase atten-
tion span, concentration, and self-control.
ADHD has been diagnosed with increasing fre-
quency in recent years, especially among chil-
dren, and has become a matter of much debate 
among parents and educators. Some believe 
that many children diagnosed with ADHD are 
simply unusually active, and that medicat-
ing children for the condition is tantamount to 
drugging them into submission. Others — both 
children and adults — have found that taking 
medication has completely transformed their 
ability to get work done and has significantly 
enhanced their lives. When my friend’s doctor 
prescribed Ritalin for her, he explained that 
some of his patients liken it to putting on a pair 
of glasses: It brings clarity.
It’s hard to blame people for being suspicious 
of the medical establishment, which has not 
always worked well in the past (as recently as 
the 1950s, doctors were appearing in cigarette 
advertisements to tout their favorite brands). 
Still, most people find that professional asso-
ciations like the American Psychological 
Association are generally trustworthy, and 
when they decide — as in this case — that 
a disorder is “real,” then it’s best to assume 
they’re right.
Definitions of health and sickness have always 
changed, and will always do so. Sociologists 
(and physicians) agree that the current medi-
cal consensus is by no means the final word 
on what diseases “actually” exist. Still, unless 
you’re ready to write off the medical establish-
ment entirely — and some are! — the best you 
can do, in medicine as in sociology, is to find 
the most reliable data and interpret them as 
well as you are able. You can refine your views 
as more data become available. Right now, the 
best evidence suggests that, though it’s not for 
everyone, medication can be enormously help-
ful for many people who have ADHD.

 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
The complex challenges faced by families in making health-care decisions are 
also challenges faced by governments, as they decide where, how, and when 
to devote resources to their citizens’ health care.
Organizing and distributing health care
Because health is so fundamentally important, there will always be debates 
over how health care is organized and distributed within societies. Everyone 
wants the best possible care for themselves and their loved ones, but the 
best possible care is extremely expensive.
Many governments and health care organizations aspire to guarantee 
adequate — ideally, far better than merely adequate — health care for all 
their citizens, but if every single person had unlimited access to all existing 
medical treatments and technology, the cost could be so high that a society 
would hardly be able to afford much else. If your family finances have ever 
been strained by the cost of health care, you understand the challenges 
that leaders in your government are facing.
What this means is that, one way or another, every society must somehow 
determine how and when various treatments will be provided — and how 
they’ll be paid for. Sociologists often study health care both to help improve 
it and because the medical establishment is a fascinating social institution.
A sociologist’s overall perspective on the health care establishment will 
depend on whether he or she leans more in the direction of Durkheimian 
functionalism or Marxism. (See Chapter 3 for more on those perspectives.)
 
✓ A functionalist will likely pay attention to the overall norms — formal 
and informal — defining who is “sick” and how they’ll be treated. Talcott 
Parsons believed that “sick” is a particular role in society, a role that 
varies among societies of different sizes and at different stages of devel-
opment. Just as there is always crime in society, there will always be 
the sick; but if a society defines too many people as sick, not enough 
work will get done and too much money will be spent on health care. If a 
society defines too few people as sick and fails to attend to basic health 
needs, it will suffer in the long run.
 
✓ A Marxist will emphasize that different parties have different material 
stakes in health care. Providers and insurance companies want to pro-
vide as much care as possible providing they’re generously paid for it, 
but the patients want that care provided at low or no cost. The govern-
ment could conceivably adjudicate between them, but is likely to be in 
control of the wealthy and thus to favor their interests.

286
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Of course, this isn’t just a black-or-white proposition: Most sociologists today 
don’t fall strongly in either of those camps but instead have a view akin to 
Weber’s: that different groups and individuals have real material interests, 
but that the conflicts among them play out on a field where the ground rules 
are set by cultural norms. For example, hospitals or insurance companies 
find themselves under siege when they deny lifesaving care to children; that 
care might be vastly expensive, and the children’s families may be unable 
to pay the cost of that care, but there’s a strong social norm discouraging 
anyone from allowing a child to die if there’s anything that can be done to 
prevent it.
What all sociologists agree on is that health care organizations are exactly 
that — organizations — and they are apt to behave like all other complex 
organizations. I explain in Chapter 12 that organizational life is about much 
more than just “getting the job done,” it’s about managing the people in the 
organization as well as managing the organization’s relationship with its 
surroundings. This is just as true for hospitals and clinics as it is for coffee 
shops, despite the fact that the stakes are much higher.
Medical professions — especially the profession of physician — are deeply 
institutionalized: To become a doctor or a nurse, you have to go through long 
training that provides not just an education in how the human body works, 
but an education in how to be a doctor or a nurse. Members of those profes-
sions tend to go about various practices and procedures in certain ways; as 
with any profession, some of those traditional practices are wise and provide 
continuity and reliability whereas others may be bad habits that ought to be 
broken. Consider that when training to be a doctor, residents (young doc-
tors learning the ropes) often work for shifts of over 24 hours. By the end of 
those shifts, they’re exhausted and, evidence suggests, more prone to make 
mistakes — but the current system is a longstanding tradition and has been 
resistant to change.
Doctors have more extensive training than do nurses, and have traditionally 
been the authorities in medical settings. Nurses, however, argue that their 
close day-to-day experience with patients (a doctor may see a given patient 
much less frequently than that patient’s nurses do) give them a valuable per-
spective that doctors too often neglect to consider, just because the doctors 
are “the experts.”
Medical professionals can be just as hesitant to believe evidence that contra-
dicts their beliefs as everyone else is. A doctor may diagnose a patient based 
on a quick assessment or a hunch, and then may be slow to notice or accept 
subsequent evidence that they may have erred in their initial judgment.

287
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
 
Medical professionals are human beings, and medical organizations are 
human institutions. As such, they’re subject to the same forces that make it 
alternately inspiring and frustrating to be a part of a complex organization. It 
may seem scary to think that your and your family’s health is in the hands of 
an organization that makes the same kind of mistakes your company or 
school makes, but it’s the truth — and only by accepting that can sociolo-
gists and others work to make medical organizations safer, more effective, 
and more efficient.
Families Past and Present
Have you ever noticed how many books, movies, and TV shows are about 
family life? Families are at the heart of most people’s lives, and they’re end-
lessly fascinating to people trying to understand the human condition. No 
sociologist (or author or filmmaker or anyone else, for that matter) can 
tell you how your family works, but sociology can help you understand the 
social patterns that influence your family. In this section, I first describe 
the history of the family and then explain what social scientists know about 
families today.
The way we never were
The family in the 1950s Dick and Jane series of reading primers for children 
featured a father in a business suit (the implication being that he’s the bread-
winner), a mother in an apron (the implication being that she’s the home-
maker), a son, a daughter, and a dog. That’s become the default image of “the 
family” that pops into many people’s minds, but it’s certainly not representa-
tive of most families today — and there were many, many families it wasn’t 
representative of even then.
The 1950s, which still loom so large in people’s imaginations as an era of 
idealized family life, were a unique time in recent history. Many men were 
returning home after fighting in World War II, and they were settling down 
with their partners to start families in the so-called “Baby Boom.” It was a 
time of relative prosperity, and both social norms and government policies 
encouraged the building of new homes in suburban settings.
Since then, there have been many conspicuous changes in family life. More 
families have two earners (rather than a single earner supporting the entire 
family), more children are born out of wedlock, and more marriages end 
in divorce. These changes are sometimes portrayed as a decline in “family 
values.”

288
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
 
You’re entitled to your opinion about what the best family structure is, and to 
argue for government policies that promote that structure, but be careful 
when using phrases like “family values.” There are many different kinds of 
family, and your family values may not be the same as your neighbor’s.
As I explain in Chapter 5, cultural change and structural change almost 
always go hand-in-hand, and it can be very difficult to sort out what caused 
what. There have certainly been some significant changes in cultural ideals 
regarding family life: Divorce, single parenting, and unmarried partnership 
are all more commonly accepted than they were five or six decades ago. 
Whether or not you regard this change as something bad, it’s important to be 
aware that there have been some real structural changes — that is, changes 
in basic social conditions — since the post-war era:
 
✓ The economy is more turbulent, and it’s much more challenging for a 
single individual to secure and hold a job that will support a family over 
several decades. Many more families have to be dual-income families 
than was the case in the 50s.
 
✓ Developments in law and corporate policies, some spurred by the efforts 
of same-sex couples unable to marry, have made it easier for unmarried 
couples to enjoy some of the practical benefits — insurance coverage, 
shared child custody — of marriage. (Still, however, it’s much more dif-
ficult for unmarried than married couples to access these benefits.)
 
✓ Though sociologists of gender still see a “glass ceiling” (see Chapter 9), 
implicit and explicit discrimination against women in educational and 
professional settings have sharply declined, making it easier for women 
to pursue careers on the same terms as men. When women today 
choose to leave jobs to raise children, because women are making rela-
tively more money today, that choice is likely to have economic conse-
quences that are more significant for the average family than they would 
have been in the 1950s.
 
✓ Advancements in contraceptive technology — most notably, the refine-
ment and legalization of the birth control pill — have given men and 
women the option to be sexually active without conceiving children. 
Exercising this option is a personal choice, but previously, it was far 
more likely that sexual activity would result in pregnancy (with abortion 
being illegal and unsafe), so people were making choices about marriage 
and family life in a very different universe of possibilities.
So change in family life has definitely happened, for a number of reasons — 
but that said, the 1950s were not the idyllic time they may seem to have 
been. In her bestselling book The Way We Never Were, historian Stephanie 
Coontz deflates what she calls “the nostalgia trap”: a trap in which people 
assume that because family life was more homogeneous in the 1950s, things 
were better then.

289
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
Among other things, Coontz points out that authorities often looked the 
other way in cases of spousal and child abuse, that it was not unusual for 
working fathers to spend a disproportionate amount of their income on luxu-
ries for themselves, and same-sex relationships were almost entirely taboo. 
The divorce rate, though it’s risen since the 1950s in most countries, pla-
teaued at about 40 percent and has now remained stable for many years. And 
marriages continue to happen at a high rate; in fact, it’s now more common 
for unmarried women in middle age and older to eventually marry (or, if 
they’re divorced, remarry) than it was in the past.
Coontz and other historians of the family also point out that in the big pic-
ture, the 1950s were a very unusual decade — probably for reasons having 
to do more with the economy and post-war social policy than with people’s 
values. The relatively low divorce rate in the 50s was just a temporary dip; 
in the United States, the divorce rate has been rising since the 1860s. Many 
changes in family life — from women’s increasing economic and social free-
dom to the removal of children from the workforce — that are often seen 
as originating in the 1960s actually began a century earlier, in the Industrial 
Revolution.
Going it alone: The challenges of single parenting
People become single parents for many rea-
sons. Often, there’s a divorce or death that 
leaves one partner with custody of children; 
sometimes grandparents or other relatives take 
custody of children whose parents can’t care 
for them; in other cases, people choose to have 
children while single; and then, of course, there 
are accidental pregnancies.
These all result in very different family situations, 
but what they all have in common is that the 
single parents face enormous challenges. That’s 
not to say that life is always a bowl of cherries for 
partnered parents, but single parents generally 
have fewer financial and personal resources to 
draw upon as they raise their children. This will 
certainly mean that they have less personal and 
professional flexibility than partnered parents; 
and the financial challenges they face mean that 
children of single parents, who are dispropor-
tionately poor in the first place, are more likely 
than the children of partnered parents to grow 
up in poverty and to suffer the consequences of 
that difficult situation.
Single parents need a lot of support from their 
families and their communities. Some find 
it unfortunate that single parenting is more 
socially acceptable today than it was in the 
past, but the past shouldn’t be romanticized.
My grandmother became a single parent when 
my grandfather died of cancer while my grand-
mother was pregnant with their sixth child. In 
their small farming town, Grandma sensed a lot 
of uneasiness about her unusual situation — in 
fact, she felt somewhat stigmatized — and she 
ultimately sought out other single parents; they 
bonded together for mutual support. Single par-
ents today may (or may not) feel less of a stigma 
than my grandmother did, but they need just as 
much help and support to give their children the 
safe, happy lives they deserve.

Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Family life, like every aspect of social life, has always changed and will con-
tinue to change. Just as there’s no such thing as a “perfect family,” there’s no 
such thing as a perfect norm of family life. Each family is different, for better 
and for worse.
The family today
What is “the family today”? Sociologically speaking, a family is any group of 
people who live together in mutual economic and social support. Usually 
families are connected by blood ties as well as emotional and financial ties, 
but as the saying goes, family is as family does. In this section, I consider a 
few of the most important issues facing families today.
Work — at home and outside the home
The division of labor in families has been a topic of contention for as long as 
there have been families; in recent decades in particular, the growing number 
of two-career families have been struggling to figure out an efficient and equi-
table way of dividing the tasks that have to be done in the home and out of 
the home.
In her 1989 book The Second Shift, sociologist Arlie Hochschild put her 
finger on the challenge facing many two-career families: Both mother and 
father work full-time jobs outside the home, but after work it’s the mother 
who takes on the “second shift” of caring for the couple’s children and man-
aging other household tasks. What especially frustrated many of the women 
Hochschild talked with was that their husbands nominally accepted the 
idea that household labor should be equitably divided . . . they just didn’t 
do their share.
Happily, evidence suggests that in the years since 1989, men have done a lot 
of catching up: Their household contributions now come closer to matching 
the work they admit they should do. Today, an unprecedented number of 
fathers are involved in tasks — from bathing children to sweeping floors to 
baking meatloaf — that most of their fathers and grandfathers could hardly 
have imagined taking routine responsibility for. Women still do the majority 
of household labor, but the gap is closing.
Men getting up off the couch has picked up some of the slack in the con-
stant amount of household labor that needs to be accomplished in a shrink-
ing amount of time . . . but getting things taken care of around the home is 
tough for any working family. Families that can afford to do so outsource 
housework and childcare, hiring nannies or housecleaners, many of whom 

291
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
travel from poorer neighborhoods (and even countries) in search of higher 
wages. Hochschild has written of the challenges faced by nannies who are 
mothers themselves, struggling to care for both their own children and 
their employers’ children. Wealthy countries are “exporting emotional 
labor,” says Hochschild. This will continue to be a challenge in the years 
and decades to come.
Kids today! They grow up so . . . slow?
Childbearing rates are falling in developed countries around the world, and 
no wonder! Kids are expensive, and they’re getting more expensive all the 
time. Just 200 years ago, most children contributed significantly to their fam-
ily’s livelihood, often by helping out on the family farm or by taking paying 
work. Today, children are required to attend school well into their teenage 
years; most finish high school and many go on to attend college or even grad-
uate school before beginning their careers in earnest.
Children in low-income families often still contribute significantly to their 
households by caring for younger siblings or by contributing income to the 
family, but most children in developed countries work only to earn experi-
ence and discretionary spending money. Parents who can afford to do so 
(including many who must stretch to do so) often find themselves entirely or 
partially supporting their children well into the children’s 20s.
As I note in the sidebar “Dad, can I take the car?”, the semi-autonomous 
state associated with adolescence is becoming increasingly the norm for 
children both young and old. Both because of technologies like the Internet 
and changing social norms, young children have more social autonomy than 
they’ve ever had; at the other end of the teenage years, young adults are 
remaining dependent on their parents for longer and longer. This is a big 
change in family structure, and families are still trying to figure out how to 
handle it.
 
Though child labor laws now limit the nature and extent of work that can be 
done by young people, teenagers normally seek some kind of employment — 
and in tough economic times, they may feel the pain even more acutely than 
mature workers. Having not completed their education, teenagers need to 
seek jobs that don’t require complex skills or training, and those jobs are 
often the first to dry up when the economy goes south.
Marriage: What’s in a ring?
The institution of marriage is not going away. A large majority of people, in 
societies around the world, still aspire to make a public lifelong commitment 
to a partner; most do marry, many more than once.

292
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
That said, the meaning of marriage is changing. Marriage was once primar-
ily a legal arrangement; now, the legal aspect of marriage is generally seen 
as secondary to its emotional aspect. A spouse is still, in a sense, a business 
partner; but he or she is also now expected to be a lifelong love and a best 
friend. That’s a tremendous amount of weight to put on a relationship. It 
works well for many couples, but the increased emotional expectation put 
upon marriage has surely been one of the factors leading to the increasing 
divorce rate over the past century.
 
Because the legal aspect of marriage is now seen as secondary, marriage is 
less universally seen as a necessary bond for loving couples. Out-of-wedlock 
births have been rising sharply in the past few years, and a big part of that 
growth has been accounted for by committed couples who begin families 
together without bothering to get married. That can create legal challenges for 
unmarried couples, but for various reasons people are increasingly using their 
growing freedom to live together and even raise children together without 
being married. Among them are millions of gay and lesbian couples who are 
not legally able to marry.
Again, though, marriage is not going away. Notably, older adults are increas-
ingly marrying, whether for the first time or in the wake of divorce or wid-
owhood. Life is getting longer, and many middle-aged and senior adults are 
finding new love in their later years — love that they’re celebrating by getting 
married. (Or remarried. Or re-remarried.)
A return to the extended family
Among the many unrealistic aspects of the Dick-and-Jane image of the family, 
perhaps the most unrealistic is the suggestion that the nuclear family is an 
island unto itself. It may or may not take a village to raise a child, but it’s 
absolutely true that every family draws on the support of extended family 
members including blood relatives, relatives by marriage, friends, coworkers, 
neighbors, and other community members. Dick and Jane’s parents couldn’t 
have done it by themselves, and neither could yours or mine.
That said, the mid-century nuclear family, in its own single-family home, was 
more independent than families before or since. Throughout history, families 
have lived together in compounds, houses, or apartment buildings. It’s long 
been routine for aged parents to live with their children, for married sisters 
to move in with their brothers, and for hired help and other people to be 
brought in to boot. The idea that a couple should live alone with their young 
children, support themselves financially, and do everything else themselves 
is relatively new, and it’s already crumbling.

293
 Chapter 15: The Family and the Life Course 
All the developments outlined in this chapter — extending adolescence, 
more school, later marriage, fewer children, longer lives, economic 
pinches — add up to an increasing reliance on extended family members 
for emotional and logistic support. Grandparents are increasingly involved 
in their grandchildren’s day-to-day lives, parents are increasingly involved 
in their grown children’s lives, middle-aged children are increasingly 
involved in their grown parents’ lives, and everyone is texting and e-mailing 
and calling and Facebooking everyone else 24/7.
It all gets a little crazy sometimes . . . but, well, that’s family.

Chapter 16
Future Passed: 
Understanding Social Change
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why societies change
▶ Predicting what comes next
▶ Considering the future of sociology
F
rom the very beginning (see Chapter 3), sociologists have wanted to 
understand, predict, and influence social change. Historians may be 
content with understanding social change in retrospect, but sociologists 
want to understand the fundamental, universal processes by which societ-
ies change . . . and if you understand those processes, you should be able 
to predict what’s going to happen in the future!
Wouldn’t that be nice? In practice, of course, it’s very difficult to predict how 
societies will change, no matter how much you understand about society. 
Think about meteorologists: Despite centuries of scientific observation and 
with all the most sophisticated technological tools at their command, they 
can’t predict the weather with any more than approximate certainty. The 
forces determining the weather are simply too complex and subject to unpre-
dictable variation for meteorologists to do much better.
And yet, they can predict the weather with reasonable accuracy. If the 6 
o’clock news on Wednesday says it’s going to rain on Friday, it probably will. 
Similarly, sociologists and other social scientists can’t tell you with perfect 
accuracy who’s going to win the next election or which neighborhoods will 
rise in value, but they can make an educated guess that will more than likely 
be accurate.
In this chapter, I first explain the Big Three sociologists’ (Marx, Durkheim, 
and Weber, for those who haven’t been paying attention) views on social 
change because they set the terms for all future sociological debate on the 
subject. Then, I explore some likely scenarios for existing societies; finally, I 
consider the future of sociology itself.

296
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Why Societies Change
As in most other aspects of sociology, debate over social change often 
returns to the ideas of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber — not just because 
they’re Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, but because together they laid out three 
views of social change that represent three convincing but distinctly differ-
ent arguments for why and how societies evolve. Understanding their views 
on social change is a good starting point for understanding how sociologists 
today think about the subject.
 
See Chapter 3 for more on Marx, Durkheim and Weber, the “big three” 
sociologists.
Marx: If it’s not one revolution, it’s another
In all things, Karl Marx emphasized the importance of the material world and 
the distribution of resources. Marx thought that societies changed as differ-
ent social groups fought over things like food, land, and power.
Marx was what’s known as a “stage theorist”: He thought that social change 
happened not gradually, but relatively suddenly. A society might be in one 
stage for centuries, then over the course of just a short period it might totally 
reorganize itself and move to the next stage. Further, he believed that the 
basic progression of stages was essentially universal and inevitable — just 
as all human beings go from being infants to toddlers to young children to 
adolescents to adults, Marx believed that all societies have to work through 
certain conflicts on their way to a final utopian stage — which, he believed, 
all societies would eventually achieve.
 
In Marx’s ideal society, everyone would have access to their share (or, if they 
had special needs, more than their share) of social resources, and everyone 
would contribute their share (or, if they had special abilities, more than their 
share) of resources to the common good.
Similar to Durkheim and Weber, Marx did a tremendous amount of historical 
research. When he looked at human history, Marx saw a series of histori-
cal stages, in each of which there were divisions among social classes. The 
nature of those classes changed, thought Marx, from time to time — slaves 
and slave owners, feudal lords and serfs, merchants and farmers. Each period 
of time, thought Marx, had its own “mode of production” in which the various 
classes were organized in a particular way to do the work required to provide 
for everyone’s needs.

297
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
None of the modes of production, though, have been perfect. In a perfect 
society, everyone would work together happily and harmoniously to grow 
food, build houses, and do everything else that needs to get done. That 
would only happen, though, said Marx, if the division of the fruits of the labor 
were equal — if everyone got a fair share of the goods created by the classes’ 
collective labor. That’s never happened.
To understand Marx’s theory of historical change, think about trying to get 
somewhere on a bike when your friends keep jumping on. One of your friends 
might hop on the pegs on the rear wheel, another might jump on the handle-
bars, and maybe someone even tries to sit on the bike’s crossbar. You can 
keep going for a little while — and, for your friends, that’s nice while it lasts — 
but before too long you’ll get tired and have to stop, or maybe even wipe out, 
in which case everyone is likely to get hurt.
For Marx, every mode of production has in one way or another been like that. 
Society can exist for a while with one class doing more than its share of the 
work and reaping less than its share of the rewards, but over time, that class 
builds resentments and anger — even as it becomes more and more crucial 
to everyone else’s well-being. Eventually, the exploited people can’t take it 
any more and rise up in opposition or otherwise sabotage the system. At that 
point, the system is essentially broken and needs to be rebuilt. The rebuilt 
system — the next mode of production — will be superior to the previous 
mode of production in some ways, but it will have its own problems that will 
eventually lead to its downfall.
Most attention (in this book and elsewhere) has been given to Marx’s theory 
about what’s specifically going to happen next: that the current mode of pro-
duction — capitalism — will give way to communism. Marx believed that the 
proletariat, who are being exploited by the bourgeois, would one day revolt 
and overthrow the inequitable system to replace it with a perfectly fair com-
munist system, in which each person contributes what they can and takes 
what they need.
So why hasn’t this happened? That’s not an easy question for Marxists to 
answer. For all its imperfections and injustices, capitalism has actually been 
spreading around the world since Marx’s time. Some societies that have 
experimented with communism (notably the defunct U.S.S.R.) have relapsed to 
capitalism, and the world’s biggest nominally communist society — China — is 
becoming de facto more capitalist every day. Where’s the revolution?
There are at least a couple of different answers. Some Marxists believe the 
revolution is still coming: that inequality is continuing to grow, and that 
revolution has only been thwarted by cunning maneuvers on the part of the 
bourgeois. (For example, exporting inequality — see Chapter 8.) Thinkers like 

298
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Noam Chomsky and Ralph Nader believe that people in power are oppressing 
the disadvantaged just as much as they ever were, that the system is just as 
corrupt as it ever was, and that revolution is necessary, perhaps inevitable.
Other Marxists observe that significant changes in technology and economic 
organization have made the division between the haves and have-nots less 
stark than it was in Marx’s time. Technological progress has lifted the stan-
dard of living around the world, so everyone is objectively living better than 
they were in the 19th century. Both technological and social changes have 
created a large middle class that didn’t exist in Marx’s time (see section “The 
growth of the middle class,” later in this chapter). If this situation persists, 
the revolution Marx anticipated may not come about because the circum-
stances Marx saw have changed dramatically.
 
The bottom line is that for Marx, social change is about conflict: about groups 
fighting for resources and power. Marx believed that when a communist 
utopia is finally achieved, social history will essentially come to an end 
because there will be no more conflict to drive social change. We’ll see!
Durkheim: Increasing diversity
Emile Durkheim agreed with Marx that social change followed a certain pre-
dictable progression, but he strongly disagreed with Marx about the nature 
of that change and the reasons for it. (See Chapter 3 for more on Durkheim’s 
life and work.)
The fundamental point to understand about historical change, said 
Durkheim, is that society is getting bigger and more complex. That’s happen-
ing for a number of interrelated reasons. As technology develops, societies 
are able to sustain greater and greater populations of people who travel and 
communicate in wider and wider circles.
For tens of thousands of years of human history, people had to work very 
hard all the time at procuring the basic necessities such as food (first by 
hunting and gathering, later by farming) and shelter (from the elements and 
from each other). Everyone had to help with these basic tasks, leaving little 
room for real diversity. In a hunting-and-gathering band, it isn’t really con-
structive to have a wide-ranging and vigorous debate about where the band 
will roam next — much less about what language should be spoken or about 
the meaning of life. Everyone had to pitch in with the basic tasks, and that 
was that. If you didn’t like it, you could leave and try to go join another band 
where you’d inevitably be doing just about exactly the same thing.
As technology developed, there was more need for a division of labor. A 
small farming community might have specialists in raising crops, specialists 
in raising animals, and specialists in facilitating trade. There became the need 
for specially trained blacksmiths, builders, and shopkeepers. Eventually, 

299
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
societies supported standing armies of professional soldiers whose job was 
to keep the wolves (actual and figurative) at bay. There started to be genuine 
diversity: The life of a farmhand was wildly different from the life of a shop-
keeper or a knight-errant.
Today, people work at an astounding variety of extremely specialized occu-
pations. My cousin’s husband works at an auto plant, where some days he 
does nothing but screw dome lights into trucks’ ceilings. My sister works 
at a firm where she sells software services that facilitate communication 
between retailers and suppliers. I’m writing a book that might be of interest 
to some people studying a particular academic discipline, very few of whom 
will take their studies in that discipline far enough to earn a living from it. 
Globalization has connected people around the world, but that means the 
people connected include a rickshaw driver in Vietnam, a stockbroker in 
Manhattan, and an artist in Uganda. All three of those people exist in the 
same global society, but they couldn’t even speak with one another if you put 
them in the same room together.
Durkheim believed that all aspects of social change are tied to this sweeping 
historical change. This diversity makes society stronger — not just in the 
sense that you get to meet interesting new people, but in the sense that when 
people organize themselves into a division of labor, they’re able to accom-
plish more. If each of the workers at an auto plant were given responsibility 
for building a car from start to finish, their jobs might be more interesting, 
but they’d get far fewer cars built. If everyone in society did the same job, 
that job would be farming or hunting, and everyone would be right back 
to the prehistoric days — complete with comfy rock floors to sleep on and 
handy flint knives to prepare food with. Only because of the division of labor 
can we have waterbeds and Ginsu knives.
As the division of labor increases, profound social change comes with it. 
People need to accept — in fact, embrace — diversity because their liveli-
hoods depend on it. All aspects of society change to accommodate the 
increasing division of labor.
 
✓ Laws become less about forcing citizens to do certain things and more 
about keeping them from infringing on other people’s prerogative to do 
different things.
 
✓ Governments — and all other social organizations — become more open 
and democratic rather than closed and hierarchical.
 
✓ Formal education increases across society, to prepare citizens to enter 
an increasingly specialized workforce.
 
✓ Religions become more tolerant, more ecumenical, and less dogmatic. 
(The relatively few exceptions are especially visible, but the fact that 
they stand out proves the overall rule.)
 
✓ Social statues and roles become much more flexible.

Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
Durkheim identified this change as the transition from “mechanical solidar-
ity” to “organic solidarity.” More on this transition — specifically as it applies 
to religion — is in Chapter 10, but in terms of social change, the important 
point to understand is that Durkheim believed that social change is driven 
by increasing diversity and functional differentiation. Unlike Marx, Durkheim 
believed that what fundamentally drives social change is people cooperating 
to bring about a better world rather than groups competing for a share of the 
world that exists.
 
Sound a little pie-in-the-sky? Maybe . . . Marx would certainly say so! Still, con-
sider the fact that an international group of researchers recently showed that 
global conflicts have been declining over the past half-century, both in overall 
number and in the number of fatalities. Does this mean that there’s another 
great conflict simmering and waiting to erupt (as Marx would say), or does it 
mean that peace is on the march (as Durkheim would say)? Only time will tell.
Weber: Into the iron cage
Max Weber came after Marx and Durkheim and was familiar with their work. 
He also conducted a great deal of historical research, and he had his own 
ideas about what forces bring about social change. (See Chapter 3 for more 
on Weber, who many sociologists today consider the most insightful sociolo-
gist of all time.)
Weber agreed with Marx that history was often marked by conflict, and that 
the results of conflicts could have profound consequences for the direction 
society would take thereafter. He agreed with Durkheim, though, that con-
flict over material things wasn’t the bottom line; that ideas and values could 
be even more powerful than hunger. When he put those two ideas together, 
what Weber ended up with was a theory of history that didn’t have the inevi-
tability of Marx’s or Durkheim’s.
For Weber, history was a little bit like a mystery novel that you open on the 
last page. You know how the story ends, but you don’t know how it got to 
that point. The butler’s dead, but was he killed by the rich heiress because he 
knew too much? Or was he killed by the maid after he was unfaithful to her? 
Or perhaps was he killed accidentally by a person who mistook him for some-
one else? The ending may not seem to make any sense, but of course if you 
went back and read the story from the beginning, it would all become clear.
The trick is that when it comes to understanding social change, “the book” 
is thousands of years long and includes every word ever written. That’s a lot 
of information to sift through, but somewhere in there is the explanation for 
why society is the way it is. What this means is that Weber didn’t have a tidy 
overall theory of history the way that Marx and Durkheim did.

301
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
 
The historical theories of Marx and Durkheim are sometimes described as 
teleological — meaning that they saw history as inevitably progressing 
toward a particular end. Weber thought that historical change happened for 
a reason, but that its end was not predetermined and that future events 
could not be foretold, they could only be guessed at.
Things happened to turn out this way, said Weber, but they could have turned 
out differently if the complex play of ideas and interests had taken a different 
turn. If Marx or Durkheim read the last page of that novel, they would say the 
butler obviously had to die. In fact, they would predict, if you opened every 
mystery novel in the library, the butler would be dead at the end of every one 
of them. Marx might guess that it was because the heiress killed him in every 
one, and Durkheim might say that no, it was the maid in every case — but the 
point is that they would both say the outcome was really never in question. 
Weber would say that things could have been different, and he wouldn’t be too 
surprised to find that a different character ended up dead in every different 
novel, maybe even the ones that started the same way.
To illustrate his point, Weber cited the examples of different countries. 
Chinese society is just as old as German society, and look how differently 
things turned out in those two countries! If those countries are looking more 
and more the same, that has to do with the current pressures of globaliza-
tion, a Weberian might say, than with the fact that the two countries’ histo-
ries had to converge. If they were on two different planets, they might look 
even more different than they do today.
Weber had specific ideas about how the Western world ended up in the “iron 
cage” of capitalism. Broadly, Weber believed that the world is caught up in 
a cycle of “rationalization,” where tradition, custom, and local identity are 
giving way to systematization, standardization, and planning. This has many 
advantages — it makes the world more fair and lets things be accomplished 
more efficiently — but it can also make the world seem colder and more 
impersonal. Anyone whose neighborhood coffee shop has been replaced by a 
Starbucks, or whose independent bookstore has been put out of business by 
Amazon, probably understands a little bit about what Weber meant.
 
If you’re interested in reading more about Weber’s ideas, see Chapter 10 for 
his views on the role of religion in history and Chapter 12 for his ideas about 
bureaucratization.
What Comes Next?
At the beginning of this chapter I liken sociological forecasting to meteorolog-
ical forecasting — it’s impossible to predict exactly what’s going to happen. 
Just as meteorologists can tell when there’s a storm front coming, though, so 

302
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
do sociologists have a fair sense of what the most important changes affect-
ing societies are, and they can make an educated guess about how things 
will shake down. In this section, I describe four major developments that are 
already taking place and will continue to be hugely important in shaping the 
future of societies around the world. Finally, I mention what we can learn 
from the past about looking to the future.
Globalization
You’ve probably heard it said that “the world is getting smaller.” Obviously 
that’s not literally true: What it means is that advances in transportation and 
communication effectively bring people and places around the world closer 
to us. In this sense, the world has been “shrinking” since the beginning of 
human history. In the following sections, I discuss advances in transporta-
tion; advances in communication; and the social effects of globalization.
Transportation
In 1873, when Jules Verne published his novel Around the World in 80 Days, 
it seemed almost impossibly daring to travel completely around the globe 
in under three months’ time. Today, you can fly around the world in a tiny 
fraction of that time: just a couple of days. It’s not cheap to do so, but you 
certainly don’t need to be fabulously wealthy to pull it off: You could do it for 
about the price of a 15-year-old car.
The prevalence and relative affordability of passenger air travel means that a 
middle-class citizen of a developed country can comfortably manage to visit 
other continents at least a few times in their life, and can fairly routinely fly 
around their own continent.
In 1873, the fastest way to get from place to place was by train, or perhaps 
by water if the winds and currents were favorable. Today, if you’re not flying 
you can drive from city to city at speeds ranging from 55 to 90 miles an hour. 
This means that not only can you road-trip across a continent in a few days, 
you can comfortably commute each day from one side of a sprawling metro 
area to the other. For example, here in Minnesota, towns that are today con-
sidered suburbs of the Twin Cities were considered way out in the country 
when my dad was young.
Still, you don’t cross the ocean every day, but you do constantly use prod-
ucts manufactured on the other side of the world. Just as profoundly impor-
tant as increased human mobility is the increased mobility of things. Last 
summer I went to an “ice bar” in Minnesota, where I drank from glasses made 
of ice. I was surprised — but not shocked — to learn later that the glasses 
had been made in New Zealand and shipped to Minnesota in frozen form. 
Transportation technology is now such that it’s more cost-effective for that 

303
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
company to manufacture all its ice glasses at a central facility in New Zealand 
and ship them to ice bars all around the world than to freeze the glasses at 
each individual ice bar.
Communication
I’m almost finished writing this book, and I’ve never even met my editors. 
They’re in Indiana, I’m in Minnesota. We’ve been sending chapters back and 
forth by e-mail. That’s something, of course, you could do by standard mail, 
but we’d never be getting this entire book written and edited in six months if 
we were doing it that way! And if we were using standard mail, it would cer-
tainly matter how far away I was; with e-mail, I could be sitting in Hong Kong 
and things would get done just as quickly. E-mail is so efficient, in fact, that 
postal services around the world are struggling with the rapid decline in mail 
volume — especially the volume of business mail. The daily delivery of stan-
dard mail to average households may soon be a thing of the past.
The development of reliable Internet service in major cities — and, increas-
ingly, small towns and rural areas — around the world is an unprecedented 
advance in communication technology. Massive volumes of information rico-
chet around the world in virtually no time, at relatively tiny cost.
There have been game-changers before, though: the printing press, the tele-
phone, radio broadcasting, television broadcasting. Each has created such a 
seismic change in the way people live that they’ve taken decades to adjust to. 
The volume of information available to the average middle-class person now 
is so great that there’s an increasing demand for “aggregators,” or people 
whose job it is to take information freely available to anyone and to sift 
through it to tell you what the bits you need to pay attention to are.
 
There’s no substitute for personal contact — and, as I note in Chapter 7, most 
of your communication via phone and Internet is probably with the people 
you see often in person anyway — but the world is now available to you with 
an immediacy that would have made Jules Verne’s head spin.
What globalization means
In the words of Marshall McLuhan, you and I truly do now live in a “global 
village.” The impact of globalization is already apparent — after all, it’s been 
happening for thousands of years. Still, the process of globalization is speed-
ing up, and by the time you’re the age your parents are (or would be), you’ll 
have seen much more change in your lifetime than they have in theirs.
One absolute certainty is that places around the world will become more sim-
ilar to each other. Travel now, if you can, because whatever places you travel 
to, they’ll never again look as different from your home town as they do now. 
Language, culture, customs, food — all those things are becoming more and 
more similar around the world.

304
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
This may seem depressing, but it’s happening for a reason, and not necessar-
ily a bad reason. The newspapers in Minneapolis and St. Paul are both hurt-
ing financially and have been laying workers off left and right, in part because 
more and more people read news online, often reading out-of-town papers 
like the New York Times or the Guardian of London. And why wouldn’t they? 
The New York Times has a news staff without parallel, and there’s no way the 
Minneapolis Star Tribune or the St. Paul Pioneer Press could compete with the 
New York Times for quality and quantity of coverage of national and interna-
tional issues.
That does mean some local voices are lost — just as the prevalence of 
Hollywood movies means that people attend local entertainments less, and 
just as the growth of McDonald’s fast food restaurants means that some 
neighborhood diners go out of business? A local theater company could 
never produce a blockbuster movie, and a local diner could never produce 
food as cheaply and quickly as a McDonald’s restaurant can, so people 
choose to go to the megaplex and eat fast food.
Of course, that’s the Durkheimian perspective — that globalization is fulfilling 
a function. A Marxist would say that huge, growing conglomerates are stifling 
small enterprises, and that we’re all poorer (culturally and otherwise) as a 
result. There’s truth to that as well, but it’s worth observing that technology 
is multiplying everyone’s choices. When my dad was growing up, you could 
get your news from the Pioneer Press, and that was it. Today, you can read 
virtually any newspaper in the world for free online. Just because we all have 
the same choices available doesn’t mean we have to make the same choices. 
(Often, of course, we do . . . and if you’ve been reading since the beginning of 
this book, you should have a lot of good ideas as to why.)
Globalization isn’t just about cultural choices, though: It’s about structure 
as well, about jobs and governments and the economy. Transportation 
technology has allowed people in developed nations to own big televisions 
and fast computers for relatively small sums, but it’s also meant the loss of 
millions and millions of manufacturing jobs in those countries as that work 
goes overseas.
 
As I write, the United States is just emerging from an economic recession that 
affected the rest of the world; there’s no way it could not have! Today, all 
countries around the world are tied in a global economy. There isn’t a world 
government, but communication and cooperation with all countries are 
increasingly essential for every national government. Globalization is tying 
every single person on Earth more and more tightly to every single other 
person, and that process is only going to accelerate in coming years. Like it or 
not, we’re all in this together.

305
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
Increasing — and decreasing — diversity
Has the place where you live been growing more diverse every year? It would 
be very surprising if it hasn’t. Even as globalization is making places more 
similar to each other, it’s also making them more diverse. Maybe 30 or 40 
years ago you had a one-of-a-kind local diner instead of a McDonald’s, but the 
crowd of people who ate there was probably a lot more homogeneous than 
the crowd you’ll find there now.
One of the results of globalization has been an acceleration of the pace of immi-
gration. There’s always been immigration, of course, but 200 or even 100 years 
ago it would have been hard to imagine large populations of immigrants from 
Somalia and Laos streaming into Minneapolis and St. Paul over just a few years’ 
time, as has happened in recent years, markedly changing the Twin Cities’ 
social landscape. Whether for jobs, political asylum, or simply wanderlust, 
people are moving all over the world at an unprecedented rate.
It’s worth repeating: The world has always been diverse. Immigrants to the 
United States and Europe today are moving for many of the same reasons — 
and having many of the same experiences as — immigrants to those places 
100 years ago. Tension, sometimes productive and sometimes destructive, 
among different groups living in the same place has always marked human 
society.
That said, social diversity, by many measures, has increased over the past 
several hundred years and will continue to increase for the foreseeable 
future. Whereas some societies remain stubbornly intolerant, overall, societ-
ies around the world embrace diversity much more fully than they did in the 
past. The idea that not everyone in their neighborhood will dress the same 
way, or speak the same language, or worship the same god, or celebrate the 
same holidays, is something that people today are much more likely to take 
for granted than their parents or grandparents were.
Further, communication and transportation technology has allowed for 
the formation and maintenance of what sociologists call transnational com-
munities: groups of people who identify and communicate with one another 
despite the fact that they are geographically spread around the globe.
From her St. Paul home, my friend Julia maintains a Web site for news and 
discussion about issues related to the Kenyan community, a community that 
is far larger than the people actually living in Kenya. On Julia’s Web site, 
people who are living in Kenya, who have emigrated from Kenya, who have 
family in Kenya, or who are simply interested in issues regarding Kenya can 

306
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
all connect and share their views. It would have been impossible for that 
global Kenyan community to connect so meaningfully before the advent 
of the Internet. Further, like many emigrants, Julia returns to Kenya every 
couple of years. It’s expensive to do so, but it would have been far more 
expensive 50 or 100 years ago.
 
But “diversity” is about more than just national, ethnic, and racial diversity: 
It’s about everything people share and don’t share. Think about all the ways a 
group of people who work in the same office are — or, at least, are more likely 
to be — more diverse than in the past.
 
✓ They can each plug in their headphones and listen, over the Internet, 
to streaming audio of almost any kind of music. They don’t all have to 
listen to the same radio station.
 
✓ They are more likely to be a mixed group of men and women.
 
✓ Dress codes have been substantially relaxed: Gone are the days when 
the subway would be filled with men in identical black suits and hats on 
the way to their jobs.
 
✓ They are more likely to have different employment histories.
 
✓ They are more likely to have lived in different places.
 
✓ They can go down to the bar after work and each choose from a wide 
array of domestic and imported beverages. You can’t just go to the bar 
and order “a beer” any more.
Those are just a few examples of how the world is growing more diverse. 
At the same time, as I note earlier, in some ways people are becoming less 
diverse. People are more likely to have come from different places, but 
the experiences they had in those different places are more similar than 
they would have been in the past. People are more likely to have different 
religious views, but how they actually practice those faiths is more similar 
than it would have been in the past. You can go to the multiplex and choose 
from among a dozen movies instead of just one, but they’re the same dozen 
movies that are showing in multiplexes across the country and, increasingly, 
around the world.
So paradoxically, societies are becoming both more and less diverse. That 
may be confusing to wrap your head around, but here’s the bottom line: Your 
identity is less and less closely tied to the place you were born or the color 
of your skin. People everywhere may have, increasingly, the same options to 
choose among (McDonald’s or Burger King?), but they do, in general, have 
more freedom to choose.

307
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
The march of technology
You may notice in the first section of this chapter that despite the differences 
among Marx’s, Durkheim’s, and Weber’s theories of historical change, the 
theorists do have something in common: They all appreciate the significance 
of technology in bringing about social change.
When I mentioned that I was working on this chapter, one of my friends asked 
in only a half-kidding way, “Why don’t you just summarize Guns, Germs, and 
Steel?” You may be familiar with that book by geographer Jared Diamond, in 
which he argues that the history of the world has essentially been shaped by 
technology and geography. Most sociologists wouldn’t agree with Diamond 
that technological and geographical resources have so definitively shaped 
human history (Marx would be most likely to agree), but no sociologist can 
deny that technology and other material resources play a huge role in shap-
ing the social world.
 
The social world that exists today would not be possible without the tech-
nology that has been developed over the past millennia — notably including 
the communication and transportation technology referenced earlier, but 
also including medical technology, agricultural technology, manufacturing 
technology, and, yes, weapons technology. Similarly, in years to come the 
social world will be affected by technological developments that it’s hard to 
foresee.
Geographers like Diamond correctly point out that a great number of tragic 
human conflicts have been caused or exacerbated by resource shortages: 
food, water, fuel. The growth of the world’s population is finally beginning 
to slow — especially in the developed world — but the Earth is still sup-
porting a tremendous number of people, billions of whom are living in pov-
erty. Barring almost unimaginable technological developments, they cannot 
all live at the standard currently enjoyed by residents of the developed 
world. You don’t need to be a strict Marxist to appreciate that vast dispari-
ties in wealth and comfort are bound to be a source of tension, perhaps 
deadly tension. In the future of global society, much will depend on how 
successfully famine and disease can be fought using technological develop-
ment and other means.
Further, the world currently relies to a great extent on irreplaceable fossil fuels 
like oil and natural gas; this is obviously unsustainable. Eventually the fuels 
will run out, and many of the technological benefits we currently enjoy — cars, 
gas heat, electricity — will be out of reach unless we develop other means of 
power generation.

308
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
So on a global scale, the priorities for technological development are clear. 
But what else will happen in terms of technological change? How else will 
people’s lives be affected by advancing technology?
That’s, of course, impossible to say. Watch any old sci-fi movie to see how 
difficult it is to guess how the world will look in the future. What it’s safe 
to say is that while technological development will bring some unwelcome 
changes and require many adjustments, it will also give people more freedom 
to live the lives they want to lead — and, in some cases, the freedom to live, 
period.
The growth of the middle class
If you ask them, most people will tell you that they’re members of the “middle 
class.” Can this be possible?
Well, technically, yes — if you consider “class” to be a vertical hierarchy 
stretching from highest class to lowest class, then everyone in the world can 
point to both someone “higher class” and someone else “lower class” than he 
or she is. Also, the “middle class” is where people want to be: It doesn’t have 
the stigma of the “lower class,” but nor does it sound as hoity-toity as the 
“upper class.”
Being “middle class” is about more than just being comfortable and unpreten-
tious, though: The middle class is real, and it’s been decisive in the economic 
history of the past couple of centuries. It’s been growing over the course of 
that period, and it’s probably a good thing if it continues to grow.
Different sociologists and economists have different definitions of what tech-
nically constitutes the “middle class,” but the various definitions generally 
include all these elements:
 
✓ A middle-class family is financially stable, but its members still have to 
work; may, in fact, need to have two incomes.
 
✓ A middle-class family can comfortably afford food and shelter, and can 
further afford a modest number of luxuries like vacations, boats, and 
home entertainment systems.
 
✓ A middle-class job typically requires specialized training or experience, 
and may involve significant individual autonomy and/or the manage-
ment of others.
 
✓ A middle-class individual likely owns a fair amount of personal property 
(house, car, furniture) but doesn’t have enough assets to draw signifi-
cant income from investments. 

309
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
The growth of the middle class is something that Marx did not see coming; 
he believed capitalist society would continue to polarize between the haves 
and the have-nots. Marxists today point to the growth of the middle class as 
one of the reasons there hasn’t been a global communist revolution — and 
it’s true, most members of the middle class are pretty happy with capitalism. 
They may feel like they’ve been unfairly deprived of something or other at 
some point, but they probably don’t think it would be a good idea to funda-
mentally change the structure of the economy.(The political views of the 
lower class and the upper class don’t line up exactly as Marx would have 
predicted, either — but that’s another matter.)
From an economic standpoint, the key to the growth of the middle class 
has been the increasing importance of skilled labor. Advancing technology 
has increased the overall productivity of society, so that the perks middle-
class families enjoy are more readily available; at the same time, it’s steadily 
increased the demand for skilled labor. By developing a useful skill of any 
sort, a person can lift themselves into the middle class if (and this is a big if) 
an appropriate job is available.
Politicians look to the middle class, with good reason, as a bellwether: In 
a democracy, if the middle class is unhappy with your policies, you’re not 
likely to stay in office for long. Will the middle class stay happy, and grow, in 
future years? That’s a big, and a very important, question.
For well over a century, members of the middle class in developed countries 
have enjoyed a steadily rising standard of living. For a long time, middle-class 
parents have been able to reasonably expect that their children will have 
bigger houses, better food, and in general a more comfortable lifestyle than 
the parents did. That’s not necessarily the case today, in part because of the 
growth of the middle class around the world. Middle-class jobs require more 
training and experience than ever, and there is more and more competition 
for those jobs.
Some countries, like India and China, are booming whereas long-developed 
countries like those in Europe and North America are reeling from the loss 
of manufacturing jobs even as they enjoy the many benefits of trade with 
countries where goods and services can be provided more cheaply. It seems 
clear that developed countries are going to have to re-imagine themselves to 
remain economically competitive in the global economy, but it also may be 
the case that their residents are going to have to accept a significant decline 
in their standard of living.
The middle class is relatively new, and it may be more fragile than most 
of its members realize. Technological advances can improve everyone’s 
standard of living — as has been the case for millennia — but technology 
can only do so much. As aspirants to a middle-class standard of living grow, 
policymakers around the world are going to have to make some difficult 
choices. Among them:

310
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
 
✓ Should trade and immigration become more free? Does any given coun-
try have more to gain or more to lose by opening its borders to new 
workers and new trade?
 
✓ As their economies change, what protections should governments guar-
antee? Food? Shelter? Transportation? Education? Health care? If these 
things are provided by the government, where will the money to fund 
them come from, and how will they be allotted among the needy?
 
✓ Is it acceptable for inequality to rise, so long as the people on the 
bottom are adequately well-off; or is rising inequality a bad thing 
regardless?
 
When I wrote, at the beginning of this section, that middle-class is something 
people want to be, I didn’t just mean that they want to say they’re “middle 
class;” I meant that they actually want to be middle class.
Everyone daydreams of a life of luxury, but very few people expect to 
achieve it. What people do generally expect is a life where they will be 
physically comfortable and financially secure, where they have to work for 
a living but where there’s a living to be had for those who will work. They 
don’t expect to have a mansion, but they expect to have a nice home. They 
don’t expect to have diamonds falling out of their pockets, but they expect 
to be able to splurge on a reasonable luxury item every once in a while. 
They don’t expect to run a big company, but they do expect to work in a job 
where they’re needed and respected, where they learn valuable skills and 
use those skills to help their employer get ahead; and to be fairly compen-
sated in return.
That’s the middle-class lifestyle. Right now, it’s a reasonable lifestyle for most 
people in the developed world, and an increasing number of people in the 
developing world, to expect. Whether it will continue to be is something no 
one knows.
A lesson from the past: Work 
for change, but don’t panic
The past few sections may seem a little scary . . . but when it comes to specu-
lation about the future, it can definitely get scarier!
Environmental disaster and economic disaster are possibilities, though (I 
write with fingers crossed) not probabilities. Other scary possibilities for the 
future include disastrous warfare, possibly on a global scale. Truly dangerous 
weapons, weapons that can destroy cities, exist in the world and are perpetu-
ally at risk of falling into the hands of people who will use them. In fact, the 
people whose hands they’re in now might well use them — they have before. 
That’s a genuine, frightening possibility.

311
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
The old-fashioned weapons are still around as well, and unfortunately they 
are used every day; millions of people around the world live in war-torn 
places where they justifiably fear for their safety. A machete is scarier than a 
nuclear warhead if it’s held by someone who’s threatening you or someone 
you love. Preventing violent conflict of all kinds is something that anyone 
concerned about society’s future has to work for.
Fortunately, a third world war may not occur; nor may environmental catas-
trophe or a global economic depression. I certainly hope they don’t, and I 
don’t suppose you’re rooting for them either. There is, however, one thing 
that’s guaranteed about the future: In your lifetime, you will see social change 
of some sort. The world is not going to stay the same.
If you’re old enough to be reading this book, you already have seen social 
change — and maybe you didn’t much care for it.
 
✓ Maybe your country elected a leader you don’t like, or passed a law you 
disagree with.
 
✓ Maybe there’s something new that everyone seems to be doing all of a 
sudden — dressing a certain way, or talking a certain way, or using some 
new device.
 
✓ Maybe you’ve seen your favorite local business close, or your favorite 
drink go out of production, or your favorite TV show go off the air.
 
✓ Maybe you’ve seen violence flare up in a previously peaceful neighbor-
hood, city, or country.
You’re perfectly justified in being concerned about any of those things. 
Sometimes things do change for the worse, and any kind of change can be 
stressful and worrisome. If you’re a senior citizen, you’ve seen some dra-
matic, downright shocking changes in your life — and chances are, you’ll 
see even more to come. If you’re still relatively young, just wait and see what 
happens. It will surely surprise you. (It will surprise me, too.)
 
It’s true that some aspects of social change are hard to control, but it’s also 
true you do have the power to influence social change. Whatever world you 
want to see in the future, you can help make it more likely that it will come 
about. Whatever power you have to make your voice heard, use it! History 
books are full of stories about people who fought, sometimes against formida-
ble odds, to bring about the change they wanted to see, and succeeded.
Another thing worth paying attention to in history books, though, is that 
they are similarly full of people who thought the world was going to hell 
in a handbasket. It’s no exaggeration to say that since the beginning of 
recorded history, there have been people who thought that the change they 
were seeing — after all, everyone’s seen change, no matter when and where 
they’ve lived — was absolutely it, the final straw, the end of all that is good 
and right in the world. You know people like that; in fact, you might be a 
person like that. If so, you have a lot of company.

312
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
As it happens, the world hasn’t ended. Babies are still being born, teenagers 
are still disobeying their parents, people are still falling in love (and out of 
love, and in love again), people are working hard at jobs they’re proud of, and 
fighting and praying and laughing and crying and, eventually, dying. I don’t 
know who you are or where you’re living, but even if you’re somehow picking 
this book up in the year 3001, I’ll bet you’re living in a form of social organiza-
tion where most people, most of the time, care for one another and work to 
make the world a better place for everyone. You’re probably living in a place 
where most people are happy most of the time, but even if you’re living in a 
place where some terrible things are happening, you probably have hope for 
the future, hope that things will get better. And sociologists would say that 
you have many, many reasons to believe that.
Sociology in the Future
Enough about the possibility of world peace or global catastrophe . . . let’s 
get down to brass tacks. What’s the future of sociology? In this section, I look 
in the direction(s) sociology itself might be heading in decades to come.
Will sociology continue to exist?
It may surprise you to find that heading in a book full of useful sociologi-
cal information: Why wouldn’t sociology continue to exist? Clearly, it’s been 
useful in the past. Why wouldn’t it be useful in the future? I think it will be, 
and I think sociology will be around for a long, long time. The interesting 
question is whether people will continue to call it “sociology.”
There’s no question that the sociological worldview has become more and 
more common since sociology was founded in the 19th century. The idea that 
it would be interesting, productive, or even appropriate to study human inter-
action scientifically was something that was not at all taken for granted in the 
time of Comte or even Durkheim. (See Chapter 3 for more on these thinkers.) 
Both of those sociologists spent a lot of their time defending the social sci-
ences generally — and sociology specifically — against people who believed 
the humanities and the natural sciences could together tell the world every-
thing it needed to know about society.
Today, it’s safe to say, the basic premise of sociology is taken for granted. 
Can you imagine a university that didn’t offer course in economics, psychol-
ogy, political science, anthropology, geography, education, regional studies, 
women’s studies, or business administration? All of those disciplines, today, 
are social sciences, built on the same premise as sociology: that society can, 
and should, be studied scientifically. Further, disciplines ranging from history 

313
 Chapter 16: Future Passed: Understanding Social Change
to law to even theology are using more and more of the tools of the social 
sciences. As long as human interaction is studied scientifically and systemati-
cally, sociology will be around in some form.
But with all those other disciplines studying society scientifically, what’s the 
point in having a separate discipline called “sociology”? After all, there’s no 
one thing that sociologists study that isn’t studied by people who don’t call 
themselves sociologists. There are political scientists — what’s the use of 
“political sociologists”? There are economists — what’s the use of “economic 
sociology”? There are social scientists working in schools of education — 
what’s the use of “sociologists of education”?
 
There’s a real possibility that “sociology” could go the way of “philosophy.” 
Centuries ago, most scholars were called “philosophers.” The ancient Greek 
and Roman “philosophers” studied everything from society to art to medicine 
to astronomy. The wide-ranging legacy of the term “philosophy” lives on in the 
fact that the highest degree in any basic academic is a Ph.D. — its holders are 
“doctors of philosophy” whether they study plants, people, or Plato. But who, 
today, actually calls themselves a “philosopher”? Only a relatively few people 
studying the history of philosophy and highly abstract, theoretical questions.
Way down the line, that could happen to sociology — it could become the 
very basic science of human interaction in groups and networks, with all 
the details about ethnicities and governments and places and times left to 
scholars in other disciplines. For now, though, sociology is standing strong 
on the basis of its claim to be the only social science that studies all aspects 
of social life.
For me, the most exciting thing about sociology is seeing the connections 
between how people interact at one time and how they interact at another, 
how one place is unexpectedly similar to another. To see those connections, 
you have to be open to studying wildly diverse situations, places, and times; 
you have to be open to looking, scientifically and systematically, at politics 
and education and the economy and the family and the church and every-
thing else about human life. That’s what sociologists, and only sociologists, 
do. It’s not easy, but it’s tremendously, sometimes unexpectedly, rewarding.
The paradox: More data, less information
Sociologists look at the entire social world — and thanks to advances in tech-
nology, there’s more and more of the social world to be seen. That sounds 
like a good thing, but it can also be a challenge.
In his 2000 inaugural address as president of the American Sociological 
Association, Joe Feagin pointed out that sociologists are used to working 
with only a small sample of what could possibly be known about the world. 

314
Part V: Sociology and Your Life 
How, he asked provocatively, would things be different if we suddenly knew 
everything? It might actually make sociologists more necessary than they are 
today.
Of course, sociologists still don’t know everything, but as more and more of 
the world moves online, they know vastly more than they could have imag-
ined knowing before. Consider these facts:
 
✓ Not only are social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter becom-
ing more popular, they’re increasingly linking with one another and with 
other sites. As I write, you can use your Facebook account to log on to 
many other sites — which means that information about what you do on 
those sites, to some extent, exists on the Facebook servers. Facebook 
administrators don’t know everything about the online social world, but 
they know a lot . . . and what they don’t know, their colleagues at Google 
or Microsoft may well know.
 
✓ Banks have histories of credit card transactions, and various companies 
track the progress of products from the factory to the warehouse to the 
retailer and possibly even to the individual home of the consumer. 
 
✓ When you buy your car, and when you subsequently take it in for ser-
vice, its vehicle ID number is recorded. This gives organizations who 
care to do the legwork access to detailed records of a car’s history.
 
✓ Cell phones enabled with GPS can be tracked around the world, and 
there’s serious discussion of implanting trackable microchips under 
children’s skin. (If you think that sounds scary, think about how you’d 
feel if your child was missing and there was a technology that could tell 
you precisely where they were.) 
What this adds up to is an almost inconceivable amount of information about 
human activity being — or potentially being — gathered. That has sparked 
concerns about privacy, but the fun and convenience of being networked 
seem to be irresistible for most people not to embrace. In the not-too-distant 
future, there could be in existence a minute-by-minute record of the aver-
age person’s life. Imprecise tools like surveys would be a thing of the past; 
already, network surveys (“please list all the people you know”) are being 
replaced by the far-superior data available from social networking sites.
So once the world has all this data, will the mystery of human life be 
solved? Not likely — without the help of sociologists to draw useful informa-
tion from that mountain of data, those gajillions of bits of data will be about 
as useful as a phone book that isn’t alphabetized. In the new world of infi-
nite data, sociology — a tool for making sense of social life in all its bound-
less diversity — will be more important than ever.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
S
ociology, what can I do with thee? Let me count the 
ways . . . to be precise, 30 of them. The first ten are 
books you can read if you’re looking for another sociology 
fix, the second ten are ways you can use sociological 
insights in your everyday life, and the final ten are myths 
about society busted by sociology.

Chapter 17
Ten Sociology Books That Don’t 
Feel Like Homework
In This Chapter
▶ Finding books that are fun and informative
▶ Reaching a better understanding of social conditions
I
f you want to learn more about sociology — and subjects studied by soci-
ologists — you can always pick up a textbook, or one of Talcott Parsons’s 
impenetrable tomes. You’ll probably have a better experience, however, and 
possibly even learn more if you start with one of the many sociological books 
that are fun and interesting to read.
Your local librarian or bookseller may be able to recommend some, but 
here are my personal suggestions: ten books that represent a wide range of 
sociological topics. In each of these books you’ll find interesting, eye-opening 
observations; many of them also tell compelling true stories. Qualitative 
research is particularly well-represented here because qualitative studies can 
be easier to relate to — but each of these books takes into account, and has 
informed, quantitative studies as well. (See Chapter 4 for a description of the 
distinction between qualitative and quantitative research.)
Some of these titles are relatively obscure, and some are bestselling classics 
of sociology; they’re all well-researched and well-written, and each is a door 
into the vast, fascinating discipline of sociology.
Randall Collins: Sociological Insight
Randall Collins is a preeminent sociologist in his own right, but he’s also 
helped to communicate sociological theory — thorny as it sometimes is — to 
a wide audience of students, researchers, and general readers with his publi-
cations Four Sociological Traditions and Sociological Insight.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Sociological Insight is the book that got me hooked on sociology. Here, 
Collins’s goal is to share what he refers to as “non-obvious” insights from 
sociology, to show why sociology is a unique and powerful way of thinking 
about the social world. The very readable chapters range over topics such 
as crime, relationships, and power; in each case, Collins shows why thinking 
about the topic sociologically lets you understand it in a way you might not 
otherwise.
What the book Freakonomics did for economics a few years ago, Sociological 
Insight did for sociology in 1982. How is being in a romantic relationship like 
owning property? What is the true nature of power in society? Why is crime 
inevitable, and maybe even good? You come away from Sociological Insight 
feeling like you’re in on a secret — that because of sociology, you now under-
stand the world in a way that most other people don’t. It can be a little disori-
enting, but it’s also a lot of fun.
William Foote Whyte: 
Street Corner Society
This 1943 book is one of the most important books in American sociology. 
It’s one of the best demonstrations of the power of ethnography — a form of 
qualitative research involving deep immersion in a community. Whyte con-
ducted the research for this book while he was a fellow at Harvard; he spent 
four years living in Boston’s “Little Italy” and got to know the community 
intimately. Street Corner Society is a detailed, fascinating portrait of that com-
munity. (See Chapter 14 for more on William Foote Whyte and his place in 
urban sociology.)
Besides demonstrating the value of patient ethnography, Street Corner Society 
documents the deep complexities of the kind of communities commonly 
regarded as marginal. Before sociology, people looked to great philosophers 
or the ancient Romans for models of how society “should” work. Sociologists 
said, let’s take a look at how society does work — and that meant, and still 
means, looking at societies that might not be considered exemplary. By writ-
ing about the tremendous richness and depth of society in a neighborhood 
some might have called a “ghetto” (and that Whyte himself called a “slum”), 
Whyte proved that society is just as fascinating when viewed from the 
bottom up as it is when viewed from the top down.
 
It’s also a touching human story, particularly the portion about the “corner 
boys” whose leader struggles to find his own place in life even as he helps 
resolve conflicts and knit friendships among gang members. The corner boys 
do a lot of bowling, and it turns out that the boys held in higher esteem at 
the moment also tend to score the highest at bowling. Bowling leagues today 
probably observe the same phenomenon.

319
 Chapter 17: Ten Sociology Books That Don’t Feel Like Homework
William H. Whyte: The 
Organization Man
This thick but readable 1955 book is more of an extended essay than a tra-
ditional sociological study, and in part for that reason, it’s more dated than 
other sociological bestsellers of its time. Still, it’s a fascinating portrait of 
postwar America, where suburbs were sprouting and national corporations 
were extending their reach with a big and well-trained workforce.
Like other sociologists of his time (including David Riesman, author of The 
Lonely Crowd), William H. Whyte was concerned about the homogeneity of 
American society in the 1950s. He believed that “the organization man,” a 
man concerned with conformity more than enterprising individuality, was 
becoming the new model for the American worker.
In the central section of the book, Whyte documents social life in a newly 
developing suburb; he sees suburbs as the monotonous hubs of the lives of 
the new “organization men.” Almost against his own will, though, Whyte doc-
uments the vibrant, bustling social life among the young families who enthu-
siastically populate the suburban homes of which he’s so suspicious. (For 
more on William H. Whyte and his views on suburban life, see Chapter 14.)
Erving Goffman: The Presentation 
of Self in Everyday Life
For over half a century, this 1959 book has all but defined microsociology. 
Like a good novel, it reads as though it were written in one sitting, with ideas 
and inspirations spilling out of Goffman as fast as his fingers could type.
Goffman’s central idea is that we’re actors on a stage, performing the “char-
acters” we want others to see. That idea is at least as old as Hamlet, but what 
Goffman brings is an acute sociological eye and a drive to push his premise 
as far as it will go. If we’re actors on a stage, when and how do we switch 
characters? What happens when the “stage” (the setting) or the “costumes” 
change? If we’re always acting, then is the “character” at work one who’s 
“played” by the character we are at home? And who plays that character? 
The possibilities might make your head spin, and they’ll no doubt be inspir-
ing sociological research for the next 50 years as well.

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Elijah Anderson: Streetwise
Elijah Anderson’s contemporary classic, published in 1992, is really two stud-
ies in one. Anderson writes about two Philadelphia neighborhoods: the gen-
trifying “Village” and the tough, impoverished “Northton.” (See Chapter 14 for 
more on this study.) Both neighborhoods are facing serious challenges, and 
Anderson takes the reader deep inside each neighborhood, offering greater 
understanding but not promising any easy solutions . . . because there are 
none. Many of the best sociology books are about communities, but Northton 
and the Village may be more recognizable to you than a Depression-era slum 
(Street Corner Society) or a 1950s suburb (The Organization Man).
The Northton section is especially compelling, and has been especially 
controversial. Anderson’s claim that the disappearance of “old head” role 
models has contributed greatly to the destructive behavior of younger gener-
ations has been criticized by some as an argument blaming the young victims 
of poverty and racism for their own circumstances. Decide for yourself after 
reading the book — you won’t regret it, and you won’t forget it.
Arlie Hochschild: The Second Shift
You’ll definitely recognize yourself, or your parents, or other people you 
know in Hochschild’s stories of couples managing their household labor. The 
Second Shift is worth reading — especially for couples — if only for acknowl-
edgement that it’s not only you who face challenges dividing responsibilities 
fairly. (See Chapter 15 for more on Hochschild’s observations about gender 
and household labor.)
The Second Shift is also notable in the sociology of sex and gender as one of the 
first major works to signal that the “sexual revolution” was far from over — not 
at the book’s initial 1989 publication, and not today. Just because men agree 
that women deserve equal treatment doesn’t mean that they actually treat 
women equally, or that they’re willing to take on responsibilities traditionally 
allotted to women. That situation is happily beginning to change, but as long 
as there’s tension between what people say and what they do, The Second Shift 
will remain relevant.
Viviana Zelizer: Pricing 
the Priceless Child
A real eye-opener. Forget everything you ever thought you knew about what’s 
“best” for children: Zelizer shows just how very different childhood was 

321
 Chapter 17: Ten Sociology Books That Don’t Feel Like Homework
prior to the 20th century, and how quickly it changed in just a few decades 
as rates of childbirth (and also of child death) dropped quickly and children 
were yanked out of the workforce and off the streets. One of many fascinating 
stories that Zelizer tells regards the transition in children’s life insurance, the 
value of which was once computed by figuring the amount of income parents 
were losing with the death of a child. Once children were no longer economi-
cally valuable, they became emotionally “priceless.” (For more on this idea, 
see Chapter 15.)
Pricing the Priceless Child is also an excellent example of historical sociology, 
a method where historical records serve as the evidence to answer a socio-
logical question. Zelizer relies on an array of sources: some of them shocking, 
some of them amusing, all of them interesting.
Michael Schwalbe: Unlocking 
the Iron Cage
Although The Second Shift shows that even “sensitive men” can be awfully 
insensitive, Unlocking the Iron Cage shows that even “manly” men can be 
surprisingly sensitive. Schwalbe’s fascinating study takes the reader inside 
the “men’s movement,” a movement in which men gathered to explore issues 
of gender and power. Media reports of sweat lodges and drum-beating made 
the participants sound like insecure sexists, but Schwalbe found that most 
participants were actually committed feminists who wanted to be as proud of 
their own gender as their wives, mothers, and daughters were of theirs.
Schwalbe’s methodology was participant observation — he actually sat in 
those circles and hunched in those sweat lodges along with his subjects — 
and he’s honest about the friendships he formed with the men he met. How 
can sociologists avoid being biased by their personal feelings about their 
subjects? Suggest Unlocking the Iron Cage to your book club; you’ll want to 
debate about it with someone when you’ve finished reading it.
Richard Peterson: Creating 
Country Music
In addition to being a top sociologist of culture, Richard Peterson is an ardent 
music fan — and it shows in this fun book about the history of country music. 
Country music is often spoken of as “real” music, a music that somehow taps 
into the heart of America; in this book, Peterson shows that what “real” (or 
“authentic”) means has changed over time, from the music’s early hillbilly 
days to the present, when “real” country musicians wear cowboy hats.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Creating Country Music is a fascinating look behind the scenes of country 
music, showing that what’s “authentic” is actually, in a sense, quite artificial. 
After reading this book, you’ll spend a lot less time worrying about whether a 
French restaurant, or a dance troupe, or anything is “authentic.” What counts 
as “authentic,” Peterson shows, is whatever people happen to decide is 
“authentic” at any given time.
Katherine Newman: No 
Shame in My Game
Katherine Newman is a preeminent qualitative sociologist — not that she’s 
a slouch in the quantitative department. In this book, she tells the stories of 
the working poor: people who work sometimes grueling jobs but still have a 
hard time getting ahead. Sitting behind the counter at McDonald’s and talk-
ing with the people who work there may not seem like the most complicated 
thing to you — unless you’ve done it, or unless you’ve read Newman’s book. 
As Whyte did in Street Corner Society, Newman reveals a complex world of 
pride, prejudice, struggle, and success among a group of people who are 
often ignored or dismissed by those who benefit from their labor.
 
Each of these books will teach you different things about people from different 
walks of life, but I’ll tip you off as to one of the main lessons to be learned from 
each of these books: don’t assume that you understand someone until you’ve 
walked in their shoes. By getting up close and personal (or, in some cases, 
down and dirty) with their subjects, sociologists repeatedly discover that 
choices (for example, working at McDonald’s — or not working at McDonald’s) 
that seem hard to understand actually make a lot of sense to the people who 
are making them.

Chapter 18
Ten Ways to Use Sociological 
Insight in Everyday Life
In This Chapter
▶ Using sociology to gain a new perspective on your own life
▶ Understanding how sociology affects your daily life
W
hat’s the point of studying sociology? For passing sociology tests, 
sure. For creating social policy, yes. But for your life, when you’re not 
in a sociology class or writing laws? You bet!
Sociology is useful because it can change the way you think about the world. 
When you understand how sociologists think about the social world and 
what they’ve discovered, you may find that sociology gives you a new way to 
understand the people and situations around you.
In this chapter, I list ten ways that you can use sociological insight to influ-
ence your life. In some ways, sociology can help you accomplish tasks or 
meet goals. In other ways, it can help you know what to worry about and 
what not to worry about. And, of course, it can simply help you make sense 
of confusing situations. The more you know about sociology, the more you 
know about yourself and the world around you.
Sometimes, understanding these situations through a sociological lens is like 
a light bulb turning on: You suddenly see everything in a new light. In other 
cases, you may be inspired to read further about a particular topic — or per-
haps even to conduct your own sociological research on that topic! There’s a 
huge body of sociological literature in libraries and online, but with a subject 
as complex as society, there’s always room for more.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Think Critically About Claims 
That “Research Proves” One 
Thing or Another
You can hardly turn on the TV or read the news without stumbling across a 
claim that “research proves” one product works better than another, or 
that drinking certain beverages or eating certain foods is good for you. Most 
of the time, these claims offer some kernel of truth, but it’s usually mislead-
ing to claim that existing research really “proves” something beyond any 
doubt — especially when making claims about society.
To be clear, sociologists definitely appreciate the value of research. A good 
sociologist will insist on empirical verification of any fact about the social 
world, and after they have that verification, they will critically examine it to 
see what its strengths and limitations are.
It’s precisely because sociologists so greatly value high-quality research that 
they want to see it done as well as possible. A research study can be hugely 
expensive and time-consuming, and if there’s a methodological error or if its 
results are interpreted inaccurately, all that effort becomes a waste.
Having seen and conducted many research studies, sociologists know just 
how difficult it is to conduct a convincing study. It’s well worth paying atten-
tion to the statistical significance of a study’s results, but you also have to 
ask how those results were achieved. When someone tells you that “research 
proves” something, don’t be afraid to ask what that research is and how it 
was conducted.
Beware of Unprovable Assertions 
About Society
If research studies are faulty, they can be improved with better research . . .
but there are also many statements people make about society that are 
totally unprovable. A statement is unprovable if there is no information that 
can be gathered to support or refute it. The kind of unprovable statements 
you typically hear about society are those that are so vague that it’s almost 
impossible to imagine how you would go about verifying whether or not 
they’re correct. For example:

325
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Use Sociological Insight in Everyday Life
 
✓ “Life used to be simpler.” Simpler how? Technology was less advanced 
and there were fewer career options, but does that mean that people’s 
lives were actually less complicated? If you were to conduct a study 
measuring how simple life is, what information would you gather?
 
✓ “Boys will be boys.” What does it mean to “be a boy”? Boys have Y 
chromosomes, yes, but is that really what this statement means? Or 
does it mean that there’s a particular type of behavior associated with 
being a boy that boys always do and have always done? What behavior 
is that? Can you prove it?
 
✓ “The government should stay out of it.” Why? What should the gov-
ernment do, and what should the government not do? The proper role 
of government is an incredibly complex question, and different people 
have different views on the question. Data can help determine what 
works and what doesn’t, but there’s no clear answer to the question of 
what any given social institution (government, education, the family) 
“should” or “shouldn’t” do.
When you hear statements like these, think about what kind of information 
would help to answer the question. Is there an objective way to answer the 
question with evidence? If not, then it’s something that simply must be taken 
(or not) as a matter of faith.
 
Sometimes “a matter of faith” is actually a theological question regarding God 
or the supernatural world, but “having faith” can also mean simply trusting 
someone or holding on to a hope. In this sense, everyone has faith in some-
thing: You may have faith in your friends, or have faith that things will work out 
in your romantic relationship. Having faith is important, but it’s also important 
to understand the difference between a matter of faith and a matter of fact.
Understand Barriers to Effective 
Communication
You may have heard it said that everyone’s human, and that deep down 
inside people are the same. It certainly is true that there’s common ground 
to be found even among people from very different walks of life, but it’s also 
true that there are very different languages and customs on Earth, and you 
can’t take for granted that a word or gesture that means something to you 
will mean the same thing to the next person.
This doesn’t just apply to the kind of intercultural differences you’d find 
between, say, someone from downtown London and someone from the 
Australian outback. Every household has its own little culture, and it can be frus-
trating trying to communicate with someone who lives just down the street.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
How can you transcend these barriers? Sociology doesn’t have any easy 
answers, but at least it can help you be aware of the barriers. The more you 
learn about societies and traditions other than your own, the more respect 
you have for those differences, and the more you appreciate that as difficult 
as it is to achieve understanding among people from very different social 
situations, it’s critically important.
 
Chapters 5 and 6 have a lot more information about culture and interpersonal 
communication.
Know the Difference Between the 
Identity You Choose and the 
Identities Others Choose For You
Sociologists draw a clear distinction between race, which is something other 
people look at you and decide to associate with you, and ethnicity, which is 
something that you choose for yourself. The same principle applies to all 
aspects of identity: People will look at you, or will learn things about you, and 
will make assumptions — some reasonable, some unreasonable — about who 
you are. (See Chapter 6 to read about Erving Goffman and his theory that 
you’re an “actor” on a social “stage.”)
Sociologists emphasize that “who you are” is shaped by your society and by 
your place in it, so it’s not that you can or should try to ignore your social 
context. The way you dress, what you say, where you live, who you associ-
ate with — those things do affect the way other people think about you, and 
in turn do affect the way you think about yourself. Further, the meanings 
of those things change from place to place and from time to time. Wearing 
sneakers to a baseball game and wearing sneakers to a wedding are very dif-
ferent things, and as much as you might prefer not to be judged by what you 
wear, clothes — along with other lifestyle choices — are symbols, and people 
will think differently about you depending on how you look.
But that’s not to say that you don’t have any choices in society! You can, and 
do every day, shape your own identity by the messages you send and the 
actions you take.
 
Many sociologists believe that there is no “you” in any meaningful sense out-
side of your social context — that is, that you and everyone around you think 
about you in terms of your society — so it’s not necessarily selling out to take 
social expectations into account when making choices about your life. That 
doesn’t mean, though, that you always have to meet those expectations! You 
didn’t get to choose the society you were born into, but you do get to choose 
how you navigate through it.

Understanding Art: If It Seems Confusing, 
That’s Exactly the Point
People have strong feelings about painting, music, theater — about all the 
arts. Everybody knows what they like and, in general, what they don’t, but 
they don’t always think very hard about why. Sociology probably won’t be 
very helpful in explaining precisely why one song makes you cry and another 
makes you cringe, but sociologists of culture have spent a lot of time study-
ing how different kinds of art have been used in different ways at different 
times. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but art is a social institution — 
and like all social institutions, it makes a lot more sense when you consider it 
in its social context.
Have you ever looked at a painting or a sculpture that the “experts” say is 
amazing, but that you can’t understand in the slightest and don’t even like? 
Maybe there are works of art, or songs, that even offend you — and probably, 
you’re not alone in being offended by those things. What you may not realize 
is that the artist probably knows it will offend or confuse you and people like 
you, and that may be part of why the artist is doing it. If you look at a paint-
ing and feel angry or confused, it may not be because you don’t understand 
it or you’re not smart enough or well-educated enough: making you angry 
or confused while making other people swoon with delight may be precisely 
what the artist was trying to accomplish. That doesn’t mean you’re wrong to 
feel the way you do.
Art always belongs to its place and its time. Some works of art may be reso-
nant to people for hundreds or even thousands of years, whereas others may 
seem dated within a few months. If a critic likes something — well, they come 
from a particular social context, and if that’s not a social context you share, 
it only makes sense that you won’t be interested in the same things for the 
same reasons. It doesn’t mean you’re “wrong” when you say you don’t like a 
piece of art or a certain song.
 
Art doesn’t have to match your couch — it’s more important that it matches 
your own sense of what is beautiful and interesting.
Be Smart About Relationship-Building
“It’s all about who you know” sounds like one of those unprovable assertions, 
but sociologists are appreciating its wisdom more and more every year. If 
this book were written 20 or 30 years earlier, it might not have had an entire 
chapter on social networks; but today, sociologists understand that net-
works are at the heart of almost every social process. If you live in the United 
States, then yes, in a sense the United States is “your society.” But on a 

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
concrete, day-to-day basis, it’s the actual people who you know and interact 
with who are truly “your society.” I barely know the woman who lives across 
the hall from me, but I call or e-mail my friend Whitney across the country 
in Virginia multiple times a week. My social tie to Whitney makes her much 
more influential in my life than most people in my home city of Minneapolis. 
(See Chapter 7 for more on social networks.)
What does this mean for you? It means that it’s a good idea to be deliberate 
about making and maintaining social connections. Think about what social 
networks you want to be a part of, and work your way in to them through 
both professional and personal connections. The more people you know, the 
better your information is and the more powerful you are in those people’s 
social context.
This doesn’t mean you ought to spend all your time trying to make friends 
with people you wouldn’t otherwise associate with — but it does mean that 
if you want to achieve a certain goal in society, it pays to make connections 
with people who are connected to that job you want or that place you want 
to be. Be sincere about relationship-building, but also be assertive about 
making and keeping valuable social ties. It’s highly likely to pay off.
 
Network sociologists agree that it’s good to exert some effort to meet people 
and maintain social connections that you’ve made, but it’s not necessarily 
beneficial to seem like an over-aggressive “networker.” No one likes to feel like 
they’re being used by someone else who only wants information or influence 
from them. Your most useful social ties are those with people you genuinely 
have something in common with.
Changing Society: Be Optimistic, But 
Keep Your Expectations Reasonable
So you have some issues with the world? Yeah, who doesn’t? Want to change 
the world? Go for it! You can do it; at least, you can change something. 
Still, appreciate that your society is the way it is for a lot of complex reasons. 
From the things you hate most about your society to the things you love 
dearly, it’s been a long road that’s led to your time and place. When dramatic 
social change happens quickly, it’s typically because of very unusual (and 
possibly quite painful) circumstances. Historical sociologists have spent 
decades and decades trying to understand the fascinating and mysterious 
course of social history.

329
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Use Sociological Insight in Everyday Life
How does A lead to B lead to C? It’s not always obvious, but sociologists do 
believe that somehow it all makes sense . . . and if it does make sense, that 
means you can figure out how to change it. (See the next section for more on 
social movements.)
 
A common phrase suggests that you “think globally, act locally.” That may 
sound a little hokey, but it makes good sociological sense — you can have the 
greatest impact on the people and places closest to you. Making changes in 
your everyday life can have a big impact over time, on you and on the people 
around you.
Learn How to Mobilize 
a Social Movement
Sociologists studying social movements have story after story about indi-
viduals and small groups who successfully brought about enormously conse-
quential changes in laws, policies, and customs. The Civil Rights Movement, 
the movement to end child labor, the pro-recycling movement — all of those 
had uphill battles to start with, but eventually they turned into spectacular 
successes.
Of course, they also have story after story about social movements that 
didn’t work so well. In the middle of the 20th century, there was a big move-
ment to get the United States to convert to the metric system (kilometers 
instead of miles, Celsius instead of Fahrenheit) — that one didn’t turn out 
so well, despite the fact that millions of schoolkids were made to memorize 
the metric system and learn how to convert “standard” units to metric units. 
Once they finished the fourth grade, the kids all tended to decide that was 
enough of that.
 
In social movements as in poker, it’s good to remember Kenny Rogers’s 
advice: “You gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em; know when 
to walk away, know when to run.”
If you’re interested in making social change happen, read Chapter 13 of this 
book (if you haven’t already) and then consider reading more about the 
sociology of social movements. You’ll learn something about what strategies 
might work and what strategies won’t. It pays to try to convince people that 
you’re right, but appealing only to their heads probably won’t work: You also 
have to appeal to their hearts and their bodies. Consider all the different 
ways you can connect with them and interest them in your cause. With per-
sistence and a little luck, you just might change the world . . . but be patient. 
It’s not apt to happen overnight.

Run Your Company Effectively
In Chapter 12, I explain sociologist Richard Scott’s argument that organi-
zations behave as “rational systems,” as “natural systems,” and as “open 
systems.” If Scott is correct — and most organizational sociologists believe 
that, at least in general terms, he is — your company is a machine, yes, but 
a machine made up of human beings and a machine that does its work by 
interacting with other machines. To run your company effectively, you need 
to understand:
 
✓ Your corporate organization. Is your company designed to do its job as 
efficiently as possible? Does information travel accurately and quickly 
from one part of the company to another? Is there any obvious waste? 
Does everyone know what their job is?
 
✓ Your corporate culture. How do people feel about working at your 
company? Do they like their coworkers? Do they feel like their jobs are 
healthy, satisfying parts of their lives generally — or are they just punch-
ing the clock?
 
✓ Your corporate environment. What’s going on among the companies 
you deal with as suppliers, customers, and competitors? What are the 
laws and policies that affect your business, and how are they changing?
Understanding just one — or even two — of these aspects of corporate life won’t 
do it: You have to appreciate all these dimensions of corporate life. In many 
ways, sociological insight can help you understand how your company works, 
and (even if you don’t own the place) how to be most effective in your job.
Understand How We Can All Be 
Different, Yet All Be the Same
This is one of the many paradoxes of sociology. On the one hand, sociologists 
study human societies in all their wild diversity, so sociologists appreciate 
how very different societies can be. Sociologists love to question assump-
tions that are taken for granted in their societies: Some of your very deepest 
values, beliefs, and customs are probably unique to your particular society. 
Even if it seems like it’s “common sense” or “human nature” for norms and 
values (see Chapter 2) to be the way they are in your society, that’s typically 
not the case.

331
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Use Sociological Insight in Everyday Life
And still, sociologists know that there are commonalities among all people, in 
all places, at all times. That’s why sociologists interested in corporate life in 
New York City in the 21st century might read books or articles about social 
networks in Paris in the 18th century or about the spread of a fad across 
southeast Asia in the 19th century. In the generals — if not the particulars — 
people are people, and sociology demonstrates the similarities as well as the 
differences among people in different societies.
Sociology can surprise you by demonstrating just how very different people 
are in some ways, but it can also — and just as interestingly — surprise you 
by revealing unexpected connections between people living in very different 
places at very different times.

Chapter 19
Ten My ths About Society 
Busted by Sociology
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the truth behind common myths about society
▶ Using sociology to question erroneous assumptions
You may have seen the TV program Mythbusters, where scientists and 
engineers test myths about the world to see if there’s any possibility 
these claims could actually be true. Can you actually survive a fall from a 
great height into a full dumpster? Can you make a bullet curve by flicking 
your wrist while you shoot a gun? It’s very interesting — and social scientists 
can do that, too!
Just as many people are convinced, despite all evidence, that tapping on the 
top of a soda can will make it less likely to fizz over when it’s opened, many 
people are absolutely convinced of the truth of some things about society 
that are actually not entirely true. In this chapter, I run down a list of ten 
myths about society that sociologists have shown to be at least partially 
untrue; in some cases, however, they’re complete whoppers.
These myths range across the entire discipline of sociology — so if you’ve 
been reading this book from the beginning, you’ll recognize some of them as 
myths right away. There is some truth to some of them, but none of them are 
as completely, unambiguously true as many people are convinced they are. 
Two centuries of sociological research have shown that long-held assump-
tions about the social world can actually crumble quite quickly when held up 
to the light of scientific research.
And these are just a few examples. I hope this book inspires you to question 
whether all the things you believe about society are actually true, or whether 
they’re just faulty assumptions that you haven’t bothered to test or research. 
They may well be true . . . but sociology can help you to think about how they 
can be put to the test.
Here are a few that don’t pass.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
With Hard Work and Determination, 
Anyone Can Get What They Deserve
This may be the myth that most aggravates sociologists. Especially in estab-
lished capitalist societies like the United States and Europe, there’s a wide-
spread belief that by and large, people get what they “deserve” — that is, 
that in general, wealth, income, and personal freedom correspond to how 
hard a person has tried to get ahead in life. It would be nice if it were true 
because that would mean if you needed a little more money, all you’d have to 
do would be to try a little bit harder; and if you tried as hard as you possibly 
could, you’d be fabulously wealthy.
It is true that, in most cases, some effort and dedication and sacrifice are nec-
essary to achieve material comfort. There’s no question that most people of 
comfortable (or more than comfortable) means have worked very, very hard 
to get where they are. Saying that “anyone can get ahead” is a myth is not 
to diminish the achievements of people who do work hard every day for the 
money they earn, however much it is.
What makes this a myth is that there is not a level playing field. For any 
number of reasons, some people face challenges that others don’t. There is 
racism, and there are health problems, and there are friends and family mem-
bers who need to be cared for, and there’s just plain bad luck. It happens. 
Further, what can be hard to appreciate — because few people have been 
on both ends of the wealth spectrum — is that the disadvantages of poverty 
are multiplicative, and the advantages of wealth are multiplicative. The more 
poor you are, the harder it is to climb out of poverty no matter how hard you 
work; and the more wealthy you are, the harder it is to fall out of that situa-
tion no matter how lazy you are.
It is important to make smart, prudent decisions no matter what your 
financial situation; and to get ahead, you do typically need to work hard. 
Nonetheless, the idea that people with more money must be somehow work-
ing harder or be more deserving than people with less money is a complete 
and utter myth.
Our Actions Reflect Our Values
I would like to believe that I know who I am and what I value, that there is 
something consistent and steadfast at my core and that all my actions flow 
naturally from that. Unfortunately, that’s not entirely true.
Not just sociologists, but everyone who closely and systematically examines 
human behavior — psychologists, economists, political scientists — have 
found that this is at least partially a myth. It would be very convenient for the 

335
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths About Society Busted by Sociology
social scientists if it weren’t a myth because that would mean you could poll 
someone on their attitudes and beliefs and then safely assume that you know 
what they’re going to do. In fact, again and again and again social scientists 
have seen that someone can, apparently in all honesty, tell you one thing, 
and then turn around and do something completely different. Further, people 
forget what they’ve done in the past, changing their past actions to be consis-
tent with their present values — which are likely to change in the future. This 
certainly makes life interesting for novelists and poets, but it’s a complete 
nightmare for social science.
Why don’t people act on what they seem to believe? Well, sometimes they 
do; in fact, usually they do. But there are many influences on people’s actions, 
and their core beliefs are only one of those influences. There’s peer pressure, 
there’s convenience, there’s habit . . . and let’s face it, you’re a complicated 
human being. You didn’t come with a user’s manual; you’re writing it every 
day. The bottom line is that you can’t look at someone’s actions and assume 
you know “who they are”; and vice-versa, knowing all about someone’s 
beliefs and values tells you only so much about what actions they’re going to 
take in the future.
We’re Being Brainwashed by the Media
The ubiquity of the mass media in contemporary society can be frightening. 
With tens or even hundreds of millions of viewers or listeners, it can seem 
like TV hosts and radio personalities and pop stars have a huge amount of 
influence. Those people often get pretty extreme, and it can seem like they’re 
leading the charge in fashion, politics, attitudes, and behaviors. In fact, many 
people believe that those charismatic figures are so influential that everyone 
is essentially being brainwashed by them, that they can make people do just 
about anything they want.
That is a myth. Certainly, mass-media celebrities have great influence in cer-
tain respects: They can jumpstart trends and influence social attitudes. But 
there is little sociological evidence to suggest that TV programs, radio shows, 
or Web sites can influence people in significant numbers to behave entirely 
uncharacteristically.
 
Sociologist Stanley Lieberson has found that first names for babies often 
become popular due to the rising fame of celebrities with those names. And 
The Cosby Show is widely credited with helping to erode widespread stereo-
types about African-American families.
Particularly in the present day, when people have an unprecedented number 
of options, they typically choose to watch, listen to, or read media that are 
consistent with their preexisting beliefs; if anything, media reinforce the 
beliefs and habits people had in the first place. Most importantly, though, 
people — even young children — are active and inquisitive consumers of the 

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
media. Do you believe everything you hear someone say on TV? Of course 
not . . . and neither do your neighbors.
 
Rather than getting caught up in debates over whether some media outlet or 
another has a political bias, remember that there is no such thing as a purely 
“objective” source. That’s not to say there’s no such thing as “the truth” — it’s 
just that there are different ways of telling the truth. With media from around the 
world available at a click of your computer mouse, you’ll do yourself a favor by 
looking at multiple different news sources, not just relying on any one source.
Understanding Society is Just 
a Matter of “Common Sense”
Among all these myths, the falsehood of this one should seem most obvious 
to those of you who have read any or all of this book. It’s worth repeating, 
though — not only because if it were true, every sociologist would be out of a 
job, but also because it’s potentially the most dangerous of all these myths.
There was once a time when it was “common sense” that certain races 
should be subjugated to others. It was also once “common sense” that 
women were not suited to vote, and in some societies it’s still widely 
regarded as “common sense” that women are unsuited to choose their own 
husbands or even their own sexual partners. Should people with mental dis-
abilities be locked away in institutions, or maybe even killed? That, too, was 
once “common sense.”
Those beliefs probably — hopefully! — all seem ludicrous to you now, but 
it’s not enough to dismiss long-refuted beliefs. Sociology challenges you to 
question the beliefs you take to be common sense today. That’s a lot harder, 
but to really understand how society works, and how it might be made better 
for everyone, you have to be willing to question even your most dearly held 
beliefs. That’s not to say you have to discard them, but you have to keep an 
open mind. If you don’t, not only will you be closed to interesting new ideas, 
you risk falling victim to destructive myths. They’re still out there — for 
examples, see every other section in this chapter!
 
For lots of good reasons, it’s easy to get caught up in the assumptions and 
biases of your own society — but it’s a certainty that some of those are 
regarded as nonsense in other societies, and some of the beliefs that people 
around you take for granted today will seem ridiculous 500 years from now. 
You don’t have to be a relativist — that is, someone who thinks there’s no such 
thing as truth — to appreciate the importance of questioning even assump-
tions that seem perfectly obvious and normal in your particular society.

337
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths About Society Busted by Sociology
Race Doesn’t Matter Any More
Just a few decades ago, African-Americans couldn’t sit in certain places on 
public buses or in restaurants. In 2008, an African-American was elected 
President of the United States. Does that mean race doesn’t matter any more? 
Has Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream come true: that people may be judged by 
the content of their character and not by the color of their skin?
It doesn’t diminish the amazing achievements of civil rights activists, and the 
almost unbelievable progress that’s been made in social tolerance, but to 
say that the idea that race “doesn’t matter any more” is a myth. Many more 
options are today available to people around the world regardless of their 
race, but race remains very much a factor in how people are seen, how they 
are judged, and how they are treated.
What does this mean for social policy? It’s not obvious, except that “race 
blind” policies, whatever their virtues in particular situations, are not nec-
essarily consistent with the way people see the world. What it means for 
sociology is that race remains, and will remain for the foreseeable future, 
something that must continue to be studied.
In Time, Immigrant Families Will 
Assimilate and Adopt a New Culture
If the falseness of this myth doesn’t seem obvious to you, that’s okay; for a 
long time, it didn’t seem obvious to sociologists either! For much of the 20th 
century, sociological studies of immigration were dominated by the theory 
that one way or another, over time immigrant families would melt into the 
“melting pot,” that they would leave their culture behind and join the culture 
of their new society.
Today, though, sociologists understand that there are many problems with 
this theory. The biggest problem is its assumption that there’s some kind of 
path from “less assimilated” to “more assimilated,” a path along which all 
immigrant families can all be located. It’s true that immigrant families some-
how adapt to their new circumstances, but that adaptation isn’t necessarily 
linear; they may completely change their behavior in some respects while 
remaining exactly the same in others. Further, it’s problematic to assume 
that there is a single “receiving” culture into which families can assimilate — 
any culture is really many different cultures, and it’s a mistake to think that 
becoming “American” or “English” or “Japanese” means one thing in particu-
lar, one lifestyle or set of values or even one language to which newcomers 
need to assimilate.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Further, though, the entire concept of “assimilation” suggests a kind of 
absorption that erases the experiences and values families bring with them. 
In truth, what happens is that those families’ experiences and values are 
added to the culture of their new home. Presuming otherwise can justify a 
scientifically inaccurate and personally hurtful disregard for those families’ 
contributions. Cultural integration doesn’t have to be a win-lose process of 
“assimilation”; it can be a win-win process of addition and enrichment.
Bureaucracy is Dehumanizing
This myth is touched on in Chapter 12. Like you (I’m guessing), some of the 
most brilliant sociologists in history have had concerns about the effect of 
bureaucracy on society. Max Weber called it an “iron cage” that locks people 
in its cold grip.
But those same sociologists also appreciated its virtues. Most obviously, 
there’s the fact that bureaucracy allows people to do more, more efficiently; 
Marx, Durkheim, and Weber all understood this and alluded to it in one way 
or another. By raising productivity, the widespread adoption of bureaucracy 
has meant a higher standard of living for people around the world. If busi-
ness was still done through informal understandings and personal contact, 
it would take much more time and be much more expensive to get anything 
done, and accordingly, prices of goods and services would skyrocket.
It’s also true, though, that sometimes a little dehumanizing can be a good 
thing. It may seem infuriating when you can’t get a human being on the 
phone, or can’t convince anyone to bend a policy when you accidentally miss 
a credit card payment — but that “dehumanizing” property of corporate 
bureaucracy also makes it much harder for those companies to discriminate 
or mistreat people for arbitrary reasons. Bureaucracy can sometimes feel 
cold and impersonal, but it also gives you a tremendous amount of freedom 
to be who you want and do what you want, to be treated simply as a number 
rather than as a person about whom others have expectations and to whom 
they will extend only certain privileges. In that way, bureaucracy can actually 
allow you to be more human.
People Who Make Bad Choices Are 
Just Getting the Wrong Messages
There’s a persistent belief that people who make “bad choices” — whether 
they’re choices you simply disagree with, or choices that seem to actively 
contradict their values or goals — are “getting the wrong messages,” that 
they’re somehow under the influence of people or publications that are 

339
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths About Society Busted by Sociology
persistently misleading them about what the “right choices” are. And some-
times they are.
Most people, however, in most societies, are getting a lot of messages from a 
lot of sources. Those sources may include:
 
✓ Friends
 
✓ Family members
 
✓ Teachers
 
✓ Coworkers
 
✓ Spiritual leaders
 
✓ Physicians or counselors
 
✓ The media
Among those messages, the ones they pay attention to may vary from situa-
tion to situation, and from day to day.
Sociologist David Harding’s study, mentioned in Chapter 7, shows that people 
who get conflicting messages are often more confused and may have less pre-
dictable behavior than people who are hearing consistent messages; but every-
one has a number of different sources of information to inform their decisions.
If you make poor decisions, it probably does mean that you’re getting “the 
wrong messages” . . . but you’re probably getting “the right messages” as 
well. Which messages you choose to act on is up to you.
Society Prevents Us From 
Being Our “True Selves”
Some psychologists believe that the process of growing up is, at least in con-
temporary society, almost universally traumatic — that as people learn to 
adapt to social expectations, they are forced to betray their “true selves.”
It certainly feels like that sometimes, but most sociologists believe that it 
doesn’t even make sense to think about a “true self” that stands outside 
of society. Who you are and what you do is fundamentally social, from the 
moment you are born. It’s your society that gives meaning to your life, that 
gives you a language, history, friends, and family. For your entire life, even 
your most intimate, personal thoughts are deeply wrapped in your social life. 
Your “true self” cannot be separated from your society: Even if you leave your 
society, your experiences there will continue to give shape and meaning to 
your experience for the rest of your life.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
This may be the very best reason to study sociology because unless you 
understand your society, you cannot really understand yourself. And if you 
don’t understand yourself, how can you understand anything else?
There Is Such a Thing 
as a Perfect Society
Auguste Comte, the man who coined the term “sociology,” thought that one 
day we’d get it all figured out, that with enough effort and study we’d achieve 
the perfect society and that would be that. Needless to say, sociologists 
would be the ones in charge. (See Chapter 3 for more on Comte.)
Comte’s intellectual descendents, those being sociologists today, don’t 
believe that any more. Never in the history of the world has there been a 
society without inequality, conflict, crime, and unhappiness. Whatever you 
might consider to be a “perfect” society, we haven’t figured it out yet and we 
almost certainly never will.
Why? Because we’re not perfect people. People are selfish, foolish, and incon-
sistent, and they make mistakes. Building a perfect society out of human 
beings is like trying to build a cathedral out of Gummi Bears. It’s just not 
going to happen.
But that doesn’t mean you should give up hope! With the help of sociology 
and the other social sciences, we’ve come a long way since Comte’s time, and 
you and I have every reason to think that social conditions will get better yet. 
People aren’t perfect, but nor is there reason to think they’re fundamentally 
wicked or destructive. By working together, and by asking tough questions 
and demanding the best answers we can get, we can make the world a better 
place to live. It will never be perfect, but you know what? I’m okay with that.

Understand human and 
social interactions in an 
ever-changing world
Sociology is the study of human and societal interaction. 
Whether you’re currently enrolled in a course or want to 
learn how to apply sociological concepts to your personal 
or professional life, Sociology For Dummies helps you under-
stand how to scientifically analyze social organization and 
cultural structure.
•  Discover the who, what, and where of sociology — wrap your 
head around the basics of sociology to get a handle on what it is, 
where it came from, and who practices it
•  Put on your sociology sunglasses — learn how to look at society 
through the eyes of a sociologist to get a better understanding of 
culture, social networks, society and your place in it, and more 
•  Get a grip on the social status quo — find out how everything 
from race to sex and gender plays a role in social equality and 
inequality
•  Organize (and disorganize) social organizations — discover what 
sociology tells us about how corporations, nonprofits, govern-
ments, and social movements work (and sometimes don’t)
•  Take a look in the mirror — understand how your life’s course is 
inexplicably tied to your society
