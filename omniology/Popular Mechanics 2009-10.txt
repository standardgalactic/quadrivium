 THE NEXT BIG WARPLANE  We are now  
ﬁghting in two wars that are primarily focused 
on infantry troops, helicopters and unmanned 
aerial vehicles. As Defense Secretary Robert 
Gates continues to reﬆruAure the military, the 
future of big-ticket warplanes appears to be 
hanging in the balance.
How will the Pentagon weigh the needs of 
current wars againﬆ those of possible con-
ﬂiAs with high-tech enemies? Is the Defense 
Department responding to battleﬁeld demands 
for more surveillance aircraI rather than more 
bomb-dropping warplanes? Will the Air Force’s 
planned Next Generation Bomber have pilots at 
all—or a price tag the nation can aﬀord? For all 
these critical issues, PM provides expert,  
behind-the-scenes analysis and news. 
 COMMERCIAL TROUBLES  Recent Airbus A330 
crashes and produAion delays for Boeing’s 787 
Dreamliner have called into queﬆion the reliabil-
ity of modern aviation materials, pilot training 
and manufaAuring. PM walks you through the 
search for black-box ﬂight data recorders and 
pores over the details of crashes with aviation 
experts to keep readers current on all the day’s 
major aviation safety issues.

Aldrin is marking the 40th 
anniversary of the Apollo 11 
moon landing this summer 
with two new books, 
Magniﬁcent Desolation and 
Look to the Stars. In the 
August issue of PM, he set 
out his vision for space 
exploration, arguing that 
NASA should focus on 
establishing a Mars colony. 
And Aldrin recently worked 
with Snoop Dogg to record 
a song called “Rocket 
Experience.” Xe key line: 
“It’s time to venture far; 
let’s take a trip to Mars;  
our destiny is to the stars.”

To Mars or to the Moon 
I completely agree with Buzz 
Aldrin’s space plan —we should 
be making Mars our priority 
without completely forgetting 
about the moon (“A Bolder 
Mission”). Robert Zubrin 
[founder of the Mars Society] 
also suggeﬆed using the same 
vehicles and habitats to set up 
a moon base, which would 
save the space program 
billions of dollars. Ke shuttle 
was a miﬆake from the ﬆart, 
and the sooner it is replaced by 
the SpaceX Dragon, the better.
WES C ARR
CLERMONT, FL 
Aldrin’s article on traveling to 
Mars is a great read for an 
explorer, but misses the point 
of going to the moon. Why are 
countries intereﬆed aWer 40 
years? Firﬆ, water, which will 
help us remain there. Second: 
helium-3, which is readily 
available on the moon. It’s used 
in fusion and can produce 
energy on Earth or in rocket 
engines in space.  
CHUCK BARR
NEW BERN, NC
I agree with the majority of 
Aldrin’s plan for Mars. But as far 
as colonization is concerned, I 
think bypassing the moon is 
rash. Ke diﬆance between 
Mars and Earth creates some 
disadvantages. Emergency help 
is two years away from a 
colony, and the inhabitants will 
experience extreme isolation. 
Kese problems would be  
less severe on the moon and 
could be overcome to eventu-
ally eﬆablish a Mars colony 
when the technology and the 
people are ready.

Shaky Science 
I muﬆ address some of the 
issues you take with forensic 
science in your ﬆory “Reason-
able Doubt.” Ke ﬁeld’s 
underlying principles and 
theories originated with 
scientiﬁc ﬆudies and analysis 
of balliﬆics, blood and 
ﬁngerprints published in 
journals such as Nature as early 
as the 1880s. It was this 
foundation, combined with 
modern peer-reviewed 
publications, proﬁciency teﬆs 
and validation ﬆudies, that 
eﬆablished the forensic science 
disciplines used in crime labs. 
Many of the isolated 
problems associated with foren-
sic science can be prevented 
through lab accreditation, 
analyﬆ certiﬁcation, technical 
review and the use of opposing 
experts in court. While these 
measures will not eliminate all 
of the problems, they will go a 
long way in identifying, solving 
and minimizing their eﬀeds.
GEORGE SCHIRO, M.S., 
F-ABC, FORENSIC SCIENTIST
CADE, LA 
I was sad to see a negative 
spotlight put on forensic 
science. I’m currently ﬆudying 
biology and have taken two 
forensic science courses. 
Although I was relieved that 
you included the National 
Academy of Sciences’ 
suggeﬆion to create a National 
Inﬆitute of Forensic Science, 
accredited colleges and 
universities already oﬀer 
degrees in the subjed.

A series of successful rocket tests in the 
Mojave Desert (below) marked another step 
in the development of a car built to acceler-
ate to more than 1000 mph. The Bloodhound 
Supersonic Car project is led by the same 
British-based team that built Thrust SSC, the 
car that in 1997 set the current land speed 
record of 763 mph. The design calls for 
three completely different engines: a custom-
designed hybrid rocket for initial thrust, the 
jet engine from a Euroﬁghter Typhoon war-
plane for additional power and a typical gas 
engine used to start the car and pump 
high-test peroxide into the rocket engine.

of the lower jaw —the same range of movement oﬀered 
by aircra^ simulators. Engineers at Britain’s University of

that controls aircra^ simulators to build a “chewing

Electric Flight Line A Aviation designers around the world are experimenting with 
novel ele5ric-power designs.  e Boeing Fuel Cell Demonﬆrator combines a proton 
exchange membrane fuel cell and lithium-ion battery to power its ele?ric motor. In January 
French designers ﬂew the Alatus ele?ric glider for the ﬁrﬆ time and plan to sell it this year, 
taking advantage of their freedom from the rules that limit U.S. companies. Makers of the 
Sonex E-Flight, made in Wisconsin, hope data from their plane will help shape new FAA rules. 
 
Even as the federal government jump-ﬆarts ele.ric 
cars with $2.4 billion in research funds, ele.ric airplanes 
are getting held back. In fa., current Federal Aviation 
Adminiﬆration rules prohibit ele.ric motors in light sport 
aircraC, a class of planes typically ﬂown by less experienced 
pilots. Ge FAA decrees that LSAs be powered only by recipro-
cating engines, a measure intended to keep high-powered 
turbine engines out of the hands of novice sport pilots. Gis 
rule is now thwarting the sale of ele.ric airplanes in the 
United States. “We’re relu.ant to introduce new technology 
on a less experienced pilot population,” says the FAA’s Steve 
Flanagan, who helped write the LSA rules. “We need to get 
some more ﬂight experience with ele.ric motors.” Gat 
position is fruﬆrating to Randall Fishman, an ultralight pilot 
who’s currently developing an ele.ric two-seat sport plane, 
the Ele.raFlyer-X. Ge $65,000 kit plane is being designed to 
LSA speciﬁcations so it can quickly go into produ.ion if and 
when the FAA gives ele.ric airplane motors the okay.
Powerplant: 
:e plane uses 
a 100-volt 
50-hp 
brushless

magnet motor.

Ele.ric airplanes are 
not being made juﬆ for 
joyrides (“Who’s Killing 
the Ele.ric Plane?,“ 
right). Swiss engineers 
have unveiled the 
prototype of an airplane 
they hope will become 
the ﬁrﬆ manned vehicle 
to ﬂy around the world 
powered only by the 
sun. Ge Solar Impulse 
has the wingspan of a 
Boeing 747-400 but 
weighs only 3500 
pounds, comparable to 
a typical family car. Ge 
wings are packed with 
more than 12,000 solar 
cells that power four 
10-hp ele.ric motors 
and charge lithium-ion 
polymer batteries. Teﬆ

Once considered oddities, multiarmed tools are 
becoming mainﬆays of hospital operating rooms. 7e 
induﬆry trailblazer in the human–robot medical team is the 
da Vinci HD Surgical Syﬆem, a multiarmed assiﬆant that is 
dire?ly controlled by a surgeon who sits at a nearby console. 
7e syﬆem, made by Intuitive Surgical of Sunnyvale, Calif., 
has been ﬆeadily adopted by hospitals performing urology, 
gynecology and cardiology operations since the HD’s 
introdu?ion in 2006. A new version of the da Vinci includes a 
powerful high-deﬁnition camera, a fourth arm for complex 
procedures, and dual control ﬆations used for teaching new 
surgeons or to allow two do?ors to collaborate during 
surgery. Jim Hu, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
in Boﬆon, has removed more than 600 cancerous proﬆates 
with the da Vinci. He says that robotic assiﬆance allows him 
to overcome the limitations of human do?ors, allowing 
smaller incisions and less blood loss. 7e syﬆem even 
auto-corre?s for any shaking as the do?or manipulates the 
tools from the console. But could the assiﬆant one day 
operate without a do?or’s guidance? “Unless they develop 
artiﬁcial intelligence that can recognize 
variations in human anatomy, physi-
cians will always be needed,” Hu says. 
“But who knows? If you had told me 
when I was in medical school in the 
’90s that I would be using a robot to 
make incisions one day, I wouldn’t have 
believed it.”

When a missile punched through the clouds
oﬀ the coaﬆ of California this paﬆ June, the world’s  
moﬆ powerful mobile military laser had it in its sights. But the 
Airborne Laser (ABL), a 747 with a chemical laser mounted in 
its nose, ﬁred only a low-intensity beam to track its target. 
Oﬃcials at Boeing, which heads a coalition of companies that 
make ABL, say it is a crucial ﬆep to proving that lasers can 
deﬆroy balliﬆic missiles as they launch, yet the success may 
not be enough to save the program. Teﬆifying before 
Congress, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that ABL 
would likely never be deployed for its mission. “You would 
need a laser something like 20 to 30 times more powerful 
than the chemical laser in the plane right now to be able to 
get any diﬆance from the [defenses that prote^ the target 
missile’s] launch site,” Gates said. He also scrapped plans to 
build another ABL aircraa—and program oﬃcials in the 
Pentagon admit funding is in limbo.
But there is another ﬂying prototype in Boeing’s hangar 
that hints at a more promising future for laser weapons: the 
Advanced Ta^ical Laser. ATL’s kilowatt-class chemical laser 
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the ABL’s, since it is designed to 
hit targets at shorter ranges, essentially replacing bullets 
and bombs with a more precise beam of lethal light. Boeing 
won’t release speciﬁcations, but in a recent teﬆ at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, ATL hit a target from  
9 miles away, roughly a tenth of the planned teﬆ range for 
ABL mentioned by Gates. A smaller laser could ﬁnd wider 
use on helicopters, warships or unmanned aerial drones, 
making potential sales worth the ﬆeep development coﬆs.

deﬆroying the robots in a 
way that kills their

Harvey Greer (Bruce Willis) 
muﬆ ﬆop the rampage. 
Moﬆow’s team created 
the ﬁlm’s various surrogate 
forms using a combination of 
computer graphics, animatron-
ics and proﬆhetics. EﬀeHs-
house KNB built 70 machines—
from FBI watcher drones to the 
display models used to sell surro-
gates to cuﬆomers. Pe team also 
layered silicon skin over robotic 
frames, then digitally added details 
like circuit boards in poﬆproduHion. 
And for scenes where Greer’s 
surrogate is mangled, Willis wore 
proﬆhetics to gain a more realiﬆic 
visual result than CGI. “It’s juﬆ more 
fun to build ﬆuﬀ and ﬁlm it,” Moﬆow 
says. “We’re all little kids with our 
eleHric train sets. Our eleHric train 
set juﬆ happens to be a big Holly-
wood movie with all the bells and 
whiﬆles on it.”
Creating the illusion of robotic 
perfeHion also required some subtle 
alterations. For example, when aHors 
were portraying surrogates, visual-
eﬀeHs artiﬆs digitally cleaned their 
skin of ﬂaws in poﬆproduHion. 
“Before I ﬆarted this movie, I [thought] 
Hollywood was full of fabulous-looking 
people,” Moﬆow says. “But the 
number of people who look like ideal 
prototypes is aHually not that many.”

says. “We were ﬂying in models.”
In the near future, humans never

sophiﬆicated robot surrogates into 
the world. Piloting these proxies from 
a special chair that plugs into their 
brain, operators experience everything 
their surrogates do, but incur none of 
the risks. Pat is, until someone ﬆarts

Using an emergency generator is both a balancing a; and a 
guessing game: It’s tempting to try to pull as many watts from  
the machine as possible, but plug in too many appliances and 
you’ll trip the circuit breaker. Ge Generac Power Syﬆems 
XG8000E Generator ($1299) features a unique power meter 
that indicates when the unit is approaching its limit. Given that 
the machine can produce a heJy 8000 watts (10,000 for brief 
surges), you’ll have more than enough power to run a well  
pump, a full-size fridge, a fan, lights, a microwave and a space 
heater before that happens.  — SETH PORGES

 E Ink e-book readers

a whole lot less 
expensive. We like it  
as a budget-priced 
e-book reader, but its 
lack of an internal  
3G connePion 
(translation: no 
downloading books 
over the air) might be a 
deal breaker for 
anybody who has ever 
used a Kindle. 
Stud-Seeking Radar
 If you’re juﬆ searching for a ﬆud, any 
old ﬆud ﬁnder (or even a magnet) will do. 
But if you’re drilling into concrete and need 
to avoid rebar, you’ll want something with 
slightly  keener radar.  e Milwaukee M12 
Cordless Sub-Scanner Dete1ion Tool 
($350) can pinpoint materials buried 
under 6 inches of concrete (not to mention 
ceramic tile, marble or gypsum). Wat’s a 
full 2 inches deeper than anything else on 
the market. And, yeah, it’ll ﬁnd a ﬆud, too.

has a 4.3-inch touchscreen 
that allows users to pull and 
print online coupons, movie

 Reaching the heights 
necessary to hang drywall 
has traditionally involved a 
choice of two tools: ﬆilts, 
which can be dangerous and 
tiring, or a ladder, which 
needs to be continually 
moved. Because the 
Tru-Stride Drywall Stilts 
($320) have an anklelike 
articulating motion built 
into their heel, they purport 
to better mimic a natural 
ﬆride, allowing for greater 
comfort and mobility. To see 
for ourselves, we ﬆrapped 
them on and ﬆarted liLing 
30-pound pieces of 
wallboard. Our ﬁndings: 
While the heel took some 
getting used to, we quickly 
found ourselves able to 
handle drywall tasks with 
greater speed and eﬃcien-
cy. But if you’ve never used 
ﬆilts before, the height can 
be intimidating. (Our 
suggeﬆion: Wear a helmet.)

new model. It comes in powertrain 
tiers—2.5i, 3.6R and 2.5GT—and eight 
trim levels. Ge new Legacy feels 
markedly more grown up than its 
predecessor. And, yes, it’s much bigger 
too, with almoﬆ 4 inches more rear 
legroom and 9.5 more cubic feet in the 
trunk. A four- cylinder and V6 are 
available, but our hearts belonged to the 
265-hp 2.5GT turbo. Externally 
diﬀerentiated by its hood scoop, the 
turbo is a blaﬆ to drive, oﬀering smooth 
power with a torque peak that plateaus 
between 2000 and 5200 rpm. Apart 
from the painfully slow, manual-
transmission-equipped base model, 
there isn’t a Subaru Legacy we wouldn’t 
enjoy driving at length—especially that 
lively 2.5GT.  — B.W.
+e S model comes 
with Ducati Tra<ion 
Control (DTC), 
which measures 
lean angle and will 
retard the ignition 
when dangerous 
levels of wheelspin 
are dete<ed. +e 
syﬆem can be set 
to one of eight 
sensitivity levels or 
switched oﬀ. We 
only felt the syﬆem 
intrude once, gently 
cutting engine 
power and perhaps 
saving our hide.

Not surprisingly, the 
specs of the Cadillac 
mirror those of the Lexus—the outside 
dimensions of these crossovers are 
within 3 inches of one another. Under the 
hood, the RX has more power, and only 
Lexus oﬀers a hybrid model. Both have 
generously sized, leather-lined interiors. 
But when it comes to hauling, there are 
diﬀerences. Fe Lexus rear seats adjuﬆ 
fore and aI, a feature the SRX lacks. Fe 
Cadillac has two-tiered shelves in all the 
doors, adjuﬆable thigh support for the 
driver’s seat and a power tailgate with 
adjuﬆable opening height that can 
prevent the gate from hitting garage 
ceilings—smart. Fe SRX’s navigation 
syﬆem can discern the speed limit of the 
road you’re traveling and display it on the 
gauge cluﬆer. Lexus packs its own tech: 
Fe Remote Touch haptic device that 
controls the interior funOions is 
incredible. It’s natural to use and oﬀers 
feedback in the joyﬆick with noticeable 
resiﬆance when the cursor moves over 
any of the buttons. Impressive.
As much as  
Cadillac may 
have had its 
crosshairs set 
on Lexus, it built 
a much diﬀerent, 
much sportier 
car. If you hauled 
the family to a 
mountain 
retreat along 
some twiﬆy 
roads, the SRX 
would be the 
beﬆ tool. But in 
the daily grind, 
the RX’s greater 
reﬁnement, 
power and 
comfort would 
make us choose  
the Lexus. 
Bouncing over the 
pockmarked Detroit 
ﬆreets in the SRX, we noticed swiveling 
heads. We’re fans too. Fe designers 
really spent time on the details; by 
comparison, the Lexus is a bit plain. But 
open the doors and the situation 
reverses. Fe Caddy’s interior is too 
highly ﬆylized and busy for our taﬆe, 
while the Lexus interior is handsome, 
with materials two notches above those 
of the SRX. Fe Lexus oﬀers a far soIer 
ride—impaOs are barely audible. Fe 
ﬆruOure feels solid, and the resilient 
suspension makes road imperfeOions 
disappear. Fe SRX is noticeably ﬆiﬀer. 
Fe payoﬀ is sharper ﬆeering response 
and cornering: Fe Caddy eagerly takes 
to the curves. Fis is one buttoned-down 
crossover. Fe ﬆeering ﬆays ﬂuid, with a 
natural buildup of eﬀort. But squeeze the 
throttle, and that Lexus will out-huﬆle 
the Caddy—every time.

Clutch Player 
Every new product GM launches in 
the next few months—or years, or 
decades—will be scrutinized. So it’s 
crucial that the redesigned $23,185 
Equinox not only be solid, but that it 
provide a mainﬆream hit for GM. Ke 
basic unibody ﬆruLure and suspension 
remain from the previous Equinox. Yet 
there are two new engines, a 182-hp 
2.4-liter four-cylinder that returns 32 
mpg highway, and a 264-hp 3.0-liter V6 
that delivers 25 mpg highway—both 
hitched to six-speed automatics. Ke 
four-cylinder muﬆ work hard to move 
the 3770-pound Equinox. Fortunately, 
the six-speed automatic shiVs with 
precision and extraLs every bit of thruﬆ 
available. Ke V6 oﬀers extra muscle 
and a calmer driving experience. It’s no 
rocket, but it reaches freeway speeds 
with less ruckus and makes sweeter 
noises doing it. Still, the Equinox is more 
appliance-like than invigorating. But the 
interior is greatly improved, and 
rear-seat legroom simply dwarfs the 
competition’s.  — J.P.H. 
Game Changer
The most eagerly anticipated Porsche 
is not an even hotter version of the 911, 
but the all-new four-door Panamera. So 
we were eager to climb behind the 
wheel. Ke S model receives a 400-hp 
4.8-liter V8, but the twin turbo 
increases the aLion to 500 hp. Both 
come paired to a dual-clutch, seven-
speed PDK transmission. Ke V8 lights 
with a powerful whumph. Naturally,  
we squeezed the throttle ﬂat to  
the ﬂoor. Porsche says it hits 60 mph  
in 5 seconds—and we had no trouble 
maintaining 150 mph on our autobahn 
drive. Ke Panamera simply excels on 
home turf; it runs like it’s locked to the 
tarmac. Ke ﬆruLure is solid and the 
suspension compliant, dispatching 
surface irregularities with little cabin 
intrusion. Plenty of cars are good at this 
elevated velocity, but this one is in 
another league. Ke $89,800 Panamera 
is an amazing machine.  — L.W.

An eﬃciency model with that smaller

the artful rendering of the interior could

the 2.4-liter engine is adequate, and we 
were impressed by the SportshiU

“Oh, let the boy pick the engine. What 
difference does it make?”
So my dad agreed. 
I even remember the salesman’s 
name. It was Tom Lawrence. I pulled 
him aside and said, “Tom, here’s what 
we need: We want the full-size Galaxie 
with the 7 Litre package.” In 1966, 
for just one year, the 7 Litre was a sepa-
rate model. It was the top-of-the-line 
Galaxie, and it came standard with a 
428-cubic-inch V8. 
I couldn’t convince my dad to get the 
four-speed manual, so we ordered our 
oﬆ of us have a special afﬁnity for the 
cars our parents owned when we were 
growing up. I was brought home from 
the hospital in a ’49 Plymouth sedan. 
At age 7, I was with my dad when we 
went to Crabtree Motors in New 
Rochelle, N.Y., and bought a black and 
white Plymouth Belvedere—the one 
with the big ﬁns.
In 1966 we walked into the dealer-
ship to buy another car—a Ford Galaxie. 
By this time, I was 16 and could drive. 
Usually my dad would just buy whatever 
they had on the showroom ﬂoor.
But there were no full-size Galaxies. 
There were only Fairlanes and Falcons. 
“I don’t want a little car,” my father said. 
“I want a full-size car.” So the salesman 
asked if we wanted to order a car. And I 
piped up, “Can I pick the engine? I want 
to pick the engine.” So my mother said,

1966 FORD GALAXIE  
7 LITRE—JUST LIKE 
THE CAR HIS DAD  
ONCE OWNED.
J A Y  L E N O ’ S  G A R A G E


7 Litre with the heavy-duty Cruise-o-
Matic. I remember saying to the 
salesman, “Can we get the mufﬂer 
delete, and just go with the straight 
glasspacks?”  
“Are you sure you want that?” 
“Yup,” I told him. “That’s what 
we want.” 
Four weeks went by, 
and my whole family 
headed down to pick up 
the Galaxie. It was maroon, 
and, of course, it wore 
those 7 Litre hubcaps that 
looked like imitation cus-
tom wheels. They were 
wrapped with those skinny 
little whitewalls too. It was 
a two-door pillarless coupe 
with a black interior—a 
beautiful car.
I’ll never forget what happened 
next. My father got in the car—
we were back in the service area—
and he turned the key. The car let 
out a thunderous rrrraaaagggg- 
rrrrrraaaahhhh. And my father said, 
“There’s a hole in the mufﬂer. It’s 
a brand-new car, and there’s a hole 
in the muffler!” The salesman 
explained, “No, Mr. Leno. That’s the 
way it sounds.”
“Whaddya mean that’s the way it 
sounds?” my dad said. “What new 
car sounds like that?” The salesman 
made it clear that we had checked 
mufﬂer delete on the order, which 
specified glasspacks. My father 
looked at the order sheet, then 
looked at me. “What did you make 
me buy here?”
Frustrated, he said, “Oh fachris-
sakes, let’s get out of here.” He put it 
in drive and just nailed it. The car 
went eeeeerrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeerrrkkk! 
spinning the tires on the cement 
floor. My father said, “I bought 
a rocket ship; you made me buy a 
rocket ship!” He was yelling about 
“the stupid car” all the way home.
A couple of months went by, and I 
was in my parents’ bedroom looking 
for something. I opened my father’s 
top dresser drawer, and I saw a ticket. 
46  O C T O B E R  2 0 0 9   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
He got a ticket for going 110 mph. So 
I knew he really enjoyed the car. 
Unfortunately, like most cars of 
that time, it was brand new in ’66, 
but it didn’t look that way for long. 
By ’68, rust bubbles were appearing 
on the top of the fenders. By 1973, 
the car was pretty much rusted out. 
But that didn’t matter too much 
because I wrapped the Galaxie 
around a tree and broke it in half. 
I always loved that 7 Litre. And I 
wanted to relive the experience. 
Last year, I ﬁnally found a 7 Litre in 
Canada, a four-speed car—the one I 
always wanted my dad to get. I con-
tacted the guy, bought it and brought 
it home. Just going for a cruise down 
the highway, it makes me smile, 
remembering those days. And it still 
seems pretty quick. 
We’ve stripped down the car and 
started the restoration process. As we 
began to take the car apart, we ripped 
up the carpet where the four-speed 
was, and there was a big hacked-out 
hole around the transmission. I 
thought maybe it wasn’t a four-speed 
car after all. I checked the data plate 
and called my friend Vince Panicola, 
at the Galaxie 7 Litre website 7litre
.org, who conﬁrmed it was a real four-
speed. In those days, most people 
bought the automatics, so the cars 
came with the C6 ﬂoor pan. If a car 
was marked “four-speed,” the line 
workers took a Sawzall or a torch and 
just cut a bigger hole so they could 
stick in the manual transmission. 
That just shows you the way they did 
things back in the day. 
Speaking of which, after our 
family had bought that 7 Litre Gal-
axie, I started working at my local 
Ford dealership as the lot boy. Every 
day I’d go out with a rubber hammer 
and put on 50 or 60 sets of hubcaps. 
And every night I’d have to take 
them off, because kids would steal 
them. One day, I was carrying a big 
pile of hubcaps. As I came around 
the corner, I bumped into my boss 
and dropped all the hubcaps. He 
yelled and fired me on the spot. I 
was so upset I didn’t even tell my 
parents. I pretended to go to work 
every day for two weeks. Then I wrote 
a letter to Henry Ford II. I told him 
about the Fords our family owned 
and mentioned that this was my ﬁrst 
job. After 10 days, my boss, Ben 
Ristuccia, called me and said, 
“I don’t know who you know in 
Detroit, but you can have your old 
job back.” So you can see, I have a lot 
of history with Ford.

Resilience engineering as an  
academic idea was born in response 
to the 2003 space shuttle Columbia 
disaster. The spacecraft disinte grated 
on re-entry because thermal  panels 
had been damaged by a piece of foam 
that broke off during the launch. But 
investigators identiﬁed a larger issue: 
NASA had responded to budget cuts 
in the 1990s by adopting a “faster, 
better, cheaper” approach, launch-
ing more missions with fewer 
resources. Safety margins gradually 
narrowed, information sharing with-
ered and overconﬁdence ballooned 
without anyone really noticing. The 
organization had become brittle and 
prone to disaster. 
When a system looks solid year 
after year, it’s easy to become com-
placent, like the generals behind 
France’s old Maginot Line—which, 
after all, was pretty good at keeping 
the Germans out, though useless 
once they found another way in. It’s 
just a short step from complacency 
to pure arrogance: Why worry about 
lifeboats when the Titanic is unsink-
able? Resilience is about having 
enough lifeboats anyway. 
NASA’s not the only institution 
where ﬁnancial pressures can lead to 
brittle operations. When you squeeze 
the slack out to cut costs, you’re left 
with systems that have no real mar-
gin for error. Modern, “just-in-time” 
manufacturing methods allow facto-
ries to save money by eliminating 
stockpiles of parts and materials—
ere’s a simple truth: It’s better to bend than to 
break, and it’s best to be prepared for the worst. This 
age-old wisdom is going by a new name in slide-rule 
circles: “Resilience engineering” starts with the 
insight that it’s smart to design and maintain systems 
so they have some give. That means building technol-
ogies that offer extra capacity to handle sudden loads, 
plenty of warning when normal operations are begin-
ning to break down, backup systems in case things do 
go wrong, diverse digital architectures so that a single 
bug doesn’t produce widespread failure, and decen-
tralization so that when (not “if”) communication 
breaks down things don’t grind to a halt.

but if transportation is interrupted, 
those superefﬁcient assembly lines 
shut down in a hurry. This doesn’t 
mean that just-in-time delivery 
should go away, but the people in 
charge had better have a backup 
plan: early-warning systems and a 
plan to temporarily switch manufac-
turing sites, perhaps, or a short-term 
supply of parts always kept in reserve 
in case of emergencies.
Often, technologies become so 
tightly coupled that when one piece 
goes down, it produces a cascade 
of failures. In his 1988 book, The 
Collapse of Complex Societies, anthro-
pologist Joseph Tainter suggested 
that it was increasing complexity that 
really toppled the Mayan and Roman 
empires. The northeastern blackout 
of 2003 didn’t bring about the end of 
our civilization—but it was serious. 
The problem started when a single 
power line brushed against some 
overgrown trees, then quickly spread 
to affect 50 million people. One pro-
posal for adding resilience to the 
electrical grid is called “distributed 
energy,” with homes, businesses and 
municipalities producing at least a 
portion of their own electricity.
Resilience engineering is a spe-
cialized field, but it simply takes 
some common sense to apply its 
principles to the ordinary world. For 
instance, when the power goes out, 
trafﬁc signals go down. This causes 
accidents and traffic jams—often 
exacerbated by people who decide to 
leave work or home in favor of ﬁnd-
ing someplace where there might 
be lights and a/c. During the 2003 
blackout, New York City streets were 
gridlocked by traffic-signal failure, 
causing some to abandon their cars 
and walk, which, of course, made the 
congestion even worse. 
Happily, there’s a simple solution 
to that one: Battery backups for trafﬁc 
signals. The batteries may only last a 
few hours, but that’s a huge improve-
ment. Most blackouts are over by 
then, and even if the backup power 
does run out, there’s enough time for 
trafﬁc to disperse and police ofﬁcers 
to arrive. The system fails gracefully 
rather than catastrophically. Califor-
nia’s Sacramento County, New York 
City and many smaller communities 
have started installing battery back-
ups. And when New York experienced 
outages in 2006, many trafﬁc lights 
continued working. 
Backup power for cellphone sys-
tems can be equally important, but 
here things aren’t 
going as well. After 
studying the after-
math of Hurricane 
Katrina, the Federal 
Communications 
Commission ordered 
mobile providers to 
install backup power 
for all cell towers, but 
the industry resisted 
and the requirement 
was dropped. This 
means that cellphones, which many 
rely on in emergencies, aren’t as reli-
able in a crisis as they should be. 
 e Public Option
When it comes to large-scale emer-
gencies, the country has a hidden 
weapon—and we can do more with 
this resource. I’m talking about 
a populace filled with self-reliant, 
community-minded individuals. 
During a major crisis, on the order of 
Katrina or a serious California earth-
quake, relief services can be over-
whelmed. When individuals are pre-
pared to look after themselves for a 
while, with food, water and medicine 
on hand, and alternative sources of 
heat or power, it makes a big differ-
ence. The government can’t take care 
of everybody at once. If disaster-relief 
staffs don’t have to worry about you, 
they can take care of others—which 
means that being self-reliant can 
actually help your community.
Often, government ofﬁcials worry 
about the public panicking in a 
widespread disaster. But they have 
that backwards. In studies of more 
than 500 emergencies, the University 
of Delaware’s Disaster Research 
Center found that panic rarely 
occurred. In fact, people consis-
tently jump in to help themselves 
and their neighbors. Research by 
scholars like Kathleen Tierney, who 
directs the Natural Hazards Center 
at the University of Colorado at Boul-
der, shows that the true first 
responders are often the people on 
the scene when a disaster strikes. 
They save lives by administering ﬁrst 
aid, getting people out of hazardous 
areas and spreading warnings. Vol-
unteers improvised the water-based 
evacuation of lower Manhattan on 
Sept. 11, called an American Dunkirk 
by some, that moved masses of peo-
ple out of the danger zone.
A self-reliant attitude is good, 
but skills help mightily, too. Citizen 
training is available through the 
Red Cross, Community Emergency 
Response Teams and Neighborhood 
Emergency Response Teams. One 
underappreciated resource is the 
amateur radio community. Acquire a 
ham radio license (American Radio 
Relay League site, arrl.org) and you 
can become a major resource if a 
disaster strikes. It’s fun, too. 
In the meantime, architects, 
engineers, regulators and govern-
ment officials should take heed, 
and think about creating systems 
that don’t leave us hanging when 
things go wrong. Because, inevita-
bly, they will.

OFTEN, OFFICIALS WORRY 
ABOUT THE PUBLIC PANICKING  
IN A DISASTER. BUT THAT’S  
BACKWARDS. IN FACT, PEOPLE  
CONSISTENTLY JUMP IN TO HELP.




Turn on a light, drive a car, visit a store, and you are instantly connected to 
thousands of people you’ve never met: coal miners, autoworkers, engineers, 
farmers, truck drivers—all the people who extract, invent, build, grow and deliver 
the myriad products we use each day.
That interdependence is one of the hallmarks of the modern world—no single 
person could make a pencil from scratch today, much less manufacture a 
microchip—but it also makes us nervous. What happens when the power goes 
out? What if the global supply chain that brings us raspberries in January breaks 
down? Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina remind us that the networks supplying 
power, food, water and communications are all fragile. And we can’t always

rely on the government to save us when those systems go 
down. We are, to some extent, on our own. Then there are 
the slow-motion disasters: global epidemics, energy 
shortages, environmental degradation. 
Whether they’re concerned with short-term threats or 
long-term challenges, more Americans are deciding to get 
their own homes in order. Having a good stock of food, 
water and survival basics is a start. But many of us are going 
further, installing wind and solar power, planting modern 
versions of the victory garden and lovingly restoring (rather 
than discarding) broken appliances around our homes. We 
are discovering that, in an age of plenty, it can be satisfying 
to do things for ourselves—and that many of the same steps 
needed to make a lifestyle more disaster-resistant also make 
it more sustainable. 
The notion of self-reliance is hardly new. Henry David 
Thoreau advocated it; America’s western pioneers exem-
pliﬁed it; and institutions like the Boy Scouts inculcated it 
into generations of young people. In this special issue, PM 
explores how the concept is gaining new currency today. 
We visit some of the modern pioneers who are ﬁnding new 
frontiers of independence—people living off the grid, 
building the next generation of solar homes and challeng-
ing our throwaway culture. And in our Home, Auto and 
Tech columns this month we offer some advice on how to 
embrace the off-the-grid approach in your own life, from 
making your own biodiesel to rigging an emergency cell-
phone charger. Of course, being self-reliant doesn’t mean 
giving up the tools and technologies of the modern world. 
Even the most hardcore DIYer wouldn’t be able to repli-
cate a simple tool like the wrench pictured above (which 
my father purchased in the late 1930s and used to help 
maintain the Panama Canal). But it does mean using those 
tools to build a smarter, safer, more sustainable life.

shoeless and only a couple of sips into my morn-
ing coffee. “Hi, it’s Novella Carpenter,” the caller 
said. “My goat is giving birth.” 
Twenty minutes later I was crouched in the 
hay at Ghost Town Farm, pushing away chickens 
and peering into the pen that housed the expect-
ant mother, Bébé. Her udder was so swollen she 
couldn’t get her hindquarters down. Bleating, 
she clawed at the dirt with her right front hoof as 
if searching for a stash of Vicodin. “Pass me the 
iodine,” Carpenter said. “We better wash up.”
Similar birthing scenes have unfolded countless times in America’s agrarian past, but none, I sus-
pected, had the soundtrack of the Ghost Town neighborhood in Oakland, Calif. As Bébé’s cries reached 
an apex they were matched by the caterwauling of a police car siren on Martin Luther King Jr. Way. Then 
came the intestine-undulating bass of hip-hop from a passing car. Residents disagree on how Ghost 
Town got its name—for the isolation created when freeways cleft the neighborhood from the rest of the 
city in the 1950s? For the appallingly high murder rate? For the casket companies that used to be located 
here? More unanimously accepted is that Ghost Town is a singularly odd location for a homestead that 
hosts pigs, goats, geese, peaches, potatoes, spinach and bees. Carpenter is living a version of the Laura 
Ingalls Wilder fantasy all right, but hers is Little House in the ’Hood.

Carpenter, the author of Farm City: The Education of an 
Urban Farmer, is, by her own admission, “a bit nuts.” If so, 
she has company—similar farms have sprung up on city 
blocks in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh and Detroit. And 
food is hardly the only commodity that people are producing 
for themselves these days. A small but growing number of 
American households generate all of their electricity using 
wind, solar or micro-hydro. But off-the-grid living has come 
to mean something more nuanced than cutting all ties with 
utilities and society; for many, it’s about ﬁnding creative 
ways to produce and conserve resources at home. Hundreds 
of thousands of Americans capture rainwater in barrels, can 
food from their gardens, heat water with solar collectors and 
commute by bicycle. We may be nearly a decade into the 21st 
century, but the self-reliant spirit of an earlier era—that of 
homesteading pioneers—has returned with gusto.
At Ghost Town Farm, Carpenter cleared the head-high 
weeds from a 4500-square-foot lot and started planting. She 
didn’t ask permission. When the lot’s owner discovered the 
squat garden he warned that he would soon develop the real 
estate—that was ﬁve years ago. Now the lot is verdant with 
lavender, sage and thyme; lime, rhubarb and raspberries; 
artichoke, collard greens and avocado.  
Strolling through the garden, I became overwhelmed by a 
feeling that could only be described as vegetable lust. But 
something deeper than my appetite had been stimulated, 
too. My grandfather once worked a small mountain farm in

Greece. He immigrated to California’s Central Valley in his 
20s, opening a produce stand and then a grocery store, but 
he never totally severed his connection to the land. I remem-
ber strolling through fruit-laden trees in his backyard as a 
boy. Now, I was gearing up for major changes myself—the 
arrival of my ﬁrst child, the purchase of my own home—and I 
had been thinking about what sort of sanctuary I could cre-
ate for my own family. The house I envisioned was solar-
powered and garden-ringed, a little safer, smarter and more 
productive than the wasteful world around it. I was deeply 
curious about the experiments of modern homesteaders 
because I wondered just how self-sufﬁcient I could be, too. 
In the pen Bébé continued to push and, with a little gentle 
guidance from Carpenter, the newborn’s head crowned. 
Then the front legs were out. Bébé gave a ﬁnal, anguished cry 
and the kid was born, a female, soon to be named Hedwig. 
Twenty minutes later, she had a brother, Eeyore. The two 
Nigerian dwarf goats wobbled about on untested legs and, 
undistracted by a car alarm that had started to blare, tried to 
ﬁnd their mother’s teats.
America is dotted with remote, off-the-grid home-
steads. Certain regions—including western Texas around 
Big Bend National Park; the mesas outside of Taos, N.M.; and 
pockets of the Sierra Nevada northeast of Lake Tahoe—host 
whole mini communities. The Surprise Valley of northeast-
ernmost California supports another. There, where skyscrap-
ers of light slant from the heavens to the mirror-ﬂat ﬂoor of 
the desert, I was crouched on a mattress attached to a rope. 
The other end of the rope was hitched to a Ford F-350. The 
tires spun and soon I was hooky bobbing—surfing at 30 
mph, a roostertail of dust in my wake. I felt as gleeful as the 
Road Runner with Wile E. Coyote giving futile chase. The 
truck stopped after a few minutes and, as I spat dirt clods 
from my mouth, a pretty young woman in a red plaid shirt 
and a white cowboy hat emerged from the cab. “You’re lucky 
you’re just visiting,” Tierra Hodge said. “If you lived here we 
would have set the mattress on ﬁre.”
I’d been introduced to Tierra through a tortured chain of 
connections—my wife’s cousin’s father’s friend’s daughter, 
or something like that. She grew up off the grid on land near 
here, and had agreed to guide me around a place I never 
knew existed and introduce me to people who didn’t neces-
sarily want to be found. 
The ﬁrst stop was welcoming enough: a mountain home-
stead replete with mud, solar panels, semi-clothed children, 
and chickens. Then we had lunch in the town of Eagleville 
with Ed and Wendi Lutz, trompe l’oeil painters who’d retired 
to build an off-the-grid retreat. Tierra said the place was 
beautiful—circular, with deep wooden sills and colorful

Tina and Bill Hodge with their daughter Tierra (center) in the kitchen of their earth-berm home in Cali-
fornia’s Surprise Valley. “I’ve been building houses all my life and can say for sure that ferro-cement is 
much more forgiving,” Bill says. “If it looks right, it is right. It’s more like building a sculpture.”

bottles embedded in the walls—but the Lutzes refused to dis-
close its exact location. I’d told them I was a journalist and 
might as well have said One World Government Spy. “We have 
come to value our privacy,” Wendi said, eyeing me warily. That 
afternoon we drove past a doomsday retreat, complete with 
its own private airstrip, belonging to a wealthy Bay Area busi-
nessman. “He’s preparing for the end of the world as we know 
it,” Tierra said with an enigmatic smile. I couldn’t tell if she 
was mocking him or applauding his foresight.
The specters of ﬁnancial crisis, climate change, 
uncertain energy reserves and a fragile food supply loom large 
for the new generation of survivalists—and though I don’t 
share their apocalyptic mind-set, I ﬁnd myself relating to the 
urge to run for cover. In April, the top-selling action and 
adventure book on Amazon.com was Patriots: Surviving the 
Coming Collapse, a work described to me by its author, James 
Wesley Rawles, as a “survival manual dressed as ﬁction.” Its 
plot appeals to those on the political right, who fear a too-
powerful government—and the anarchy to come in the wake 
of its inevitable collapse. Leftie off-the-gridders gravitate more 
to the “grow-local” approach championed by author Michael 
Pollan. “We’re using up the world’s resources more quickly 
than you could imagine,” says Ruby Blume of the Institute of 
Urban Homesteading. “I think we need to be prepared.”
Lately, homesteaders of all political stripes have settled 
upon a common concern: globalization. The shock waves of 
any crisis—for instance, the subprime meltdown—now 
spread far, fast and wide. Many doubt that major institutions 
can be counted upon to save the day. “You’re on your own, 
your job is at risk, and a lot of the commodities you rely upon 
are vulnerable to disruption,” says John Robb, author of Brave 
New War, which describes how terrorists could exploit global 
systems. To my ear, such statements straddle the line between 
reasonable advice and hyperventilated threat. One day you’re 
sipping a frappuccino. The next you’re using a pitchfork to 
fend off rioting mobs. But even if I don’t fully agree with the 
dystopian diagnosis, I like Robb’s proposed cure: “You’re 
going to have to start doing more for yourself.” The beauty of 
the DIY solution is that the exact problem doesn’t matter; 
greater self-sufficiency 
makes sense to survivalists 
and eco-utopians alike.
In the early 1970s, Tier-
ra’s parents established 
their own fully off-the-grid 
homestead in Mendocino, 
and later in Surprise Valley, 
with the thought that “when 
society crumbles, we’ll be 
able to raise our children in a safe environ-
ment,” Tierra says. She and her sister, 
Celesta, grew up in a tepee; her mom, Tina, 
and dad, Bill, supported the family by breed-
ing llamas and selling medicinal herbs. 
Instead of sitting in a classroom the Hodge 
girls were home-schooled, usually outdoors. 
Instead of playing video games, they 
explored the mountains on horseback. 
Growing up in the wild was idyllic but not 
always easy. When Tierra was 15 a boy braved 
the long dirt road to the homestead to pick 
her up for a date to the county fair. He 
emerged from the car looking spiffy in an all-
white outﬁt only to have the Hodges’ pet rac-
coon pounce with muddy paws. Then one of 
the llamas pegged him with a wad of saliva. 
Tina, always on the lookout for free meals for 
wildlife she rehabilitates, shouted after the 
couple, “Goodbye, honey, have fun, and don’t 
forget to look for roadkill!” “I just about 
died,” Tierra recalls. But in spite of their 
upbringing—or because of it—the girls 
turned out ﬁne. Tierra went to college. And 
Celesta moved almost directly from the tepee 
to a penthouse in New York, gracing the cover 
of Cosmopolitan as a fashion model. 
The day after hooky bobbing, I found 
myself standing ankle deep in llama poop 
with a shovel. My job was to ferry wheelbar-
rows of the stuff up a hill to a garden, dump 
the smelly payload and then do it again. And 
again, ad inﬁnitum, until it got dark or my 
blisters burst. It was raining, so I was damp, 
and the sodden manure was getting heavy. 
Then the clouds broke, and the sun beamed 
down on the Hodges’ secluded moun-
tain—160 acres surrounded by protected 
wildlands. The air was pine-scented and 
pulsing with the sound of a creek. 
Just as my back began to give out, Bill 
mercifully invited me to tour the family’s 
airy, three-bedroom house. It was built 
earth-berm style, dug into the mountainside 
and covered by a living roof of soil and vege-
tation. The ground temperature stays close 
to 57 F year round, which makes the house 
extremely energy efficient. A small solar 
array provides enough electricity for lights, a 
refrigerator and a stereo.

Bill crouched beside an unﬁnished section of wall, where 
he pointed out a grid of 3⁄8-inch rebar layered with steel mesh. 
He had painstakingly covered the rest of the grid with a mix-
ture of sand, cement and water—ferro-cement construction 
that was affordable, ﬁre- and pest-resistant and exceptionally 
tough. Bill bent the rebar before applying the mortar, which 
resulted in strong, gracefully curving walls. The house had 
taken him more than two decades to complete—and should 
be there for a thousand more, he says. 
That kind of work—the kind that results in dirt under ﬁn-
gernails—is back in vogue. Not everybody builds his own 
home, of course, but people with ofﬁce jobs are raising hens, 
bees and wind turbines, learning to weld and taking up quilt-
ing. My blistered palms reminded me that manual work is 
still work, and tasks like shoveling manure can be just as 
mind-numbing as data entry. But I couldn’t deny the appeal 
of creating something tangible and unique. 
After the tour, Bill and I plopped chairs down outside and 
popped tops off of a couple of beers. Purplish mesas ﬂanked 
the horizon to the east. To the west rose the snow-topped War-
ner Mountains. He admitted that living off the grid on 160 
acres was “a utopian thing” not many people could emulate. 
As for Tierra, she moved back to Surprise Valley after sev-
eral years away. She started a fencing company and has built a 
small off-the-grid place of her own. It has three tiny rooms 
that she shares with Sienna, her 4-year-old daughter from a 
recent marriage. The house has only enough 
solar power for a refrigerator, a few light 
bulbs and a boom box, but the desert view 
surpasses that of most million-dollar vaca-
tion homes. 
Tierra is conﬂicted about her future and 
considering a move to the Bay Area. After 
getting a taste of her life for the past few 
days, I had more than an inkling why: It is 
lonely to live this far out of the mainstream. 
I couldn’t do it myself, no matter how daz-
zling the mountain scenery. And yet Tierra is 
proud of what she has achieved. “There’s a 
resourcefulness to living this way,” she says. 
“You know that if all else fails in the world, 
you’ll still be okay.”

around for, what, 96 billion more years?” Beck says. 
Yet it wasn’t until recently that he built his magnum opus: 
a 5800-square-foot spread with a 270-degree view of Rocky 
Mountain National Park. “When most people think about an 
off-the-grid house I don’t think they’d picture this,” Beck said 
when I arrived. Inspired by the Arts and Crafts style of archi-
tecture, Beck used wood beams, stone and stucco to create 
multiple wings fanning out under long diagonal rooﬂines. We 
passed through the front door, elaborately carved from stand-
ing dead hardwoods, and proceeded to the Great Room—a 
cavernous space with a ﬂat-screen television, a dining table 
long enough for 16 and a baby grand piano. Beams recycled 
from a century-old railroad trestle support the lofty ceiling. In 
the kitchen, granite countertops could land a small plane. 
Yet Beck’s only utility bill is for propane. Outdoors, above a 
wood-ﬁred hot tub, rise two wind turbines that can produce 
800 watts of electricity. Integrated photovoltaic cells on the 
roof contribute another kilowatt. A few dozen yards from the 
front door stands the power house: An array of solar panels on 
top generates 1.44 kilowatts and, inside, three inverters charge 
lead-acid batteries—32 in all. Three banks of evacuated-tube 
solar thermal collectors heat water for both domestic use and 
the 3.5 miles of radiant ﬂoor tubing that warms the house. 
Beck stepped out to meet with a client and encouraged 
me to explore the house on my own. I went downstairs,

where a lap pool with 10,000 gallons of 
solar-heated water acts as a thermal reser-
voir to help stabilize the home’s tempera-
ture. I was tempted to go for a quick swim—
but then chickened out. The whole place, in 
fact, screamed “look but don’t touch,” and 
I wondered what it might say about the 
broader movement for sustainability. This 
eco-mansion took copious amounts of natu-
ral resources to construct. I would love to 
live here. But, environmentally, it seemed a 
bit like a biodiesel-powered Hummer. While 
an impressive showcase for off-the-grid 
tech, Beck’s luxurious spread appeared no 
more realistic—for me anyway—than the 
Hodges’ bare-bones retreat.
The dream of living more inde-
pendently from civilization is almost as old 
as civilization itself. When Rome fell 1500 
years ago, city dwellers ﬂed to the country-
side, becoming some of the world’s first 
back-to-the-landers. The Diggers of 17th-
century England and Depression-era Ameri-
cans similarly tried to provide for themselves 
locally. By the late 1960s and early 70s, as 
many as 1 million Americans, decrying con-
sumerism and Vietnam, set out for what they 
thought would be a purer life in the country-
side. For inspiration they read Aldo Leopold 
and Henry David Thoreau; for practical 
advice on everything from carpentry to com-
post they clutched issues of the Whole Earth 
Catalog. However well-armed with informa-
tion, though, most of the would-be pioneers 
lacked practical experience and abandoned 
small-farm living after learning that it was—
as Novella Carpenter indelicately put it to 
me—“a s---ton of work.”
Carpenter knows firsthand about the 
travails of the back-to-the-landers. She 
spent her early childhood on a rural retreat 
in Idaho. Directly emulating her parents 
horriﬁed her, but the apple fell only so far 
from the tree. “I recognized that if my par-
ents were Utopia 8.5 with their hippie farm 
in Idaho, I was merely Utopia version 9.0 
with my urban farm in the ghetto,” she 
wrote in Farm City.
A few weeks after the goats were born, 
Carpenter and I strolled past a graffitied 
warehouse across from the farm, then 
turned left on Martin Luther King Jr. Way. 
Carpenter said that instead of tumbleweeds 
she sometimes spotted “tumbleweaves,” 
the lost hairpieces of prostitutes, blowing 
down the block. When we stopped in a small 
park to pick pellitory, a nettle-like plant 
that the chickens love, Carpenter recounted 
a shooting she’d witnessed there. I really 
admired Carpenter, but I thought she was more than a little 
crazy. What made her urban version of utopia any better than 
the rural approach of her parents? 
“I ﬁnd the country incredibly lonely,” Carpenter said as we 
headed back. Ghost Town was diverse and intriguing; the 
menace of thugs was tempered by the support of the commu-
nity. We strolled past a bodega whose owner, a goatherd in 
Yemen before he emigrated to the U.S., had taught her how to 
slaughter livestock. And Carpenter pointed out a monastery 
occupied by Vietnamese monks, one of whom had helped her 
chase down a runaway pig. 
Carpenter’s urban farm is doubtless an extreme case 
study. But it also seems to me the most tenable future for 
self-sufﬁcient, environmentally sustainable living. Home-
steading, to be sure, needs the sense of hardy independence 
that I’d found in Surprise Valley. And I certainly appreciated 
the appeal of some eco-luxury à la Beck. But for homestead-
ing to truly transcend niche status—for it to have any appre-
ciable impact on the world—it must embrace the community 
spirit of Carpenter’s urban experiment. Maybe I’d drunk too 
much organic goat milk. But after seeing everybody else, I 
knew that it is Carpenter’s city setup I want to draw from to 
create my own family’s future home—minus the gun-toting 
teens and the tumbleweaves, of course.
“People are always like, ‘I know where I’m going to go 
when the s--- hits the fan, Novella—to your house!’” Carpen-
ter says. “And my response to that is, if it hits the fan, it’s 
going to hit the fan for all of us.” We left the street and walked 
behind her house, where she scattered sawdust on the 
ground to cloak the livestock odors. We tossed out the pelli-
tory, and the chickens scrambled to gobble it down.

Rule 1: 
Prepare for the Worst
“The last thing I want from my story is for 
people to risk their lives,” Vaplon says. “But 
I’d thought about protecting my home, and I 
felt comfortable with my decision to stay.” 
The day before the ﬁre swept through his 2.5-acre spread, he 
woke up early to the distant smell of smoke. He immediately 
broke out 500 feet of ﬁre hose and attached it to a standpipe 
hooked up to a 10,000-gallon water tank. “I started watering

dark in Poway, Calif., as 75-mph winds drove chap-
arral embers through the air and shook the bones of 
Frank Vaplon’s house. One ember lodged in his 
woodpile and set it ablaze. Most of his neighbors 
had evacuated, but Vaplon had decided to stay and 
ﬁght the wildﬁre that was closing in on his property. 
Geared up in a mail-order ﬁreﬁghter’s outﬁt—
helmet, bunker coat, respirator, the whole thing—
Vaplon began his assault by shooting a high-
pressure stream of water at the ﬂames, but it just 
blew back against him in a hot mist. “It was like 
pissing into the wind,” Vaplon says. “So I turned 
around and started spraying down the house.”
The Witch Creek ﬁre was the fourth largest on 
record in California. A reported 1800 ﬁreﬁghters bat-
tled the blaze and several others nearby; more than 
250,000 people in San Diego County were evacuated. 
Conventional wisdom says that when a wildﬁre is 
burning down your neighborhood, you shouldn’t stick around. And, for most homeowners, 
evacuation was certainly the smartest option. But Vaplon stayed and fought back against 
the ﬁre. What did he know that everyone who followed the conventional wisdom didn’t? 
Some disasters are simply not survivable. But most are, and research on human behav-
ior suggests that the difference between life and death often comes down to the simple—
yet surprisingly difﬁcult—task of recognizing threats before they overwhelm you, then 
working through them as discrete challenges. The people who survive disasters are not 
necessarily braver or luckier than those who perish. They do, however, tend to be better 
prepared and more capable of making smart decisions under pressure. Not everyone is 
born with these traits, but almost anyone can learn them.

down everything that I could,” Vaplon says. 
“The roof, my lawn, everything.”
The former Hewlett-Packard engineer 
didn’t stop there. He raked up all the loose 
debris around his house, and then boarded 
up the attic vents where embers might get 
in. He checked the fuel for his three backup 
generators. And he put important papers in 
a steel box, which he loaded into his RV. He 
parked the vehicle facing out just in case he 
needed to bolt. “I had a plan to go if I had to 
go,” he says. “If for one minute I started to 
get scared, I would have left.”
The gear and setup were just part of 
Vaplon’s extensive preparation. Whether 
deliberately or not, he had organized his 
brain to deal with disaster by planning a 
detailed ﬁre strategy. 
“The brain is an engineering system,” 
says John Leach, a former Royal Air Force

Frank Vaplon saved

mail-order ﬁreﬁghting 
equipment and plenty 
of preparation.

combat survival instructor who now works with the Norwe-
gian military on survival training and research. “Like any 
engineering system, it has limits in terms of what it can pro-
cess and how fast it can do so. We cope by taking in informa-
tion about our environment, and then building a model of 
that environment. We don’t respond to our environment, but 
to the model of our environment.” If there’s no model, the 
brain tries to create one, but there’s not enough time for that 
during an emergency. Operating on an inadequate mental 
model, disaster victims often fail to take the actions needed 
to save their own lives.
Not Vaplon. As the ﬁrestorm approached, he stayed calm 
and clearheaded. He had done so much advance work that 
he had created a model for his brain to act on when disaster 
came. All his equipment would have been useless if he hadn’t 
thought through how to use it.
The Witch Creek blaze swept past in less than 2 minutes. 
Vaplon quickly put out the small ﬁres on his property, then 
doused his neighbors’ ﬁres. He saved one house, but another 
burned after embers set the garage on ﬁre. “There was noth-
ing I could do about that one,” he says. “When I got back to 
my house I heard these two loud thumps. Those were the gas 
tanks exploding.”
Rule 2: 
Keep Cool in a Crisis
The tornado siren sounded at the Little Sioux 
Scout Ranch in western Iowa just before the 
power went out on June 11, 2008. Scout 
Leader Fred Ullrich, an IT manager at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center, opened the door of 
the building where he and 65 Boy Scouts had taken shelter. 
“I was looking for lightning and listening for that freight 
train sound you’re supposed to hear with tornadoes, but 
there was nothing like that,” Ullrich says. “But something

told me we were in deep trouble—I don’t 
know what it was. I yelled for the boys to get 
under the tables.” As the scouts dove for 
cover, the wind came up. Ullrich leaned into 
the door from the outside, trying to push it 
shut, but instead he was picked up and 
thrown from the building. Then the 150-mph 
wind simply blew the Boy Scout shelter 
apart. “I can only describe my actions in that 
moment as being totally futile,” Ullrich says. 
“There was absolutely nothing I could do.”
Once the tornado passed, Ullrich noticed 
he couldn’t hear out of one ear. He felt 
around and ﬁshed out a stone. All around 
him was chaos. Some scouts were pinned 
under a collapsed brick chimney; others 
were trapped by the debris of the wrecked 
structure. For a brief moment Ullrich was 
dazed. Then he went into autopilot rescue 
mode. “I don’t know how to describe it,” he 
says. “It was like my brain went away, and I 
went to a very businesslike place.” He circled 
what was left of the disintegrated shelter, 
directing the able-bodied to take care of the 
injured. And the scouts did just that—apply-
ing pressure to wounds, turning T-shirts 
into bandages and elevating the legs of those 
who were in shock. Ullrich used a 6-foot iron 
bar to pry up a wooden board and bricks that 
had fallen on one boy.
In a disaster roughly 10 percent of people 
panic, while 80 percent essentially do noth-
ing. Unable to come to terms with what’s 
happening, they freeze. The remaining 10 
percent jump into action. Ullrich was 
trained in CPR and first aid, skills that 
doubtless helped the scouts that day, but 
before any of that formal training would 
even matter, Ullrich needed a separate and 
equally important skill: to get hold of him-
self and get people organized. 
According to Chris Hart, a former Navy 
psychologist and now professor at Texas

Woman’s University, being able to set aside 
fear is what separates people like Ullrich 
from others. “Fear is a good thing,” Hart 
says. “You want to have it because it can 
motivate you to action. But if you become 
overwhelmed by it, then it’s debilitating.” 
What’s worse, research shows that the 
greater the number of people who are 
involved in an emergency situation, the less 
likely it is that anyone will intervene—a phe-
nomenon known as the Bystander Effect. 
Ervin Staub, professor emeritus of psychol-
ogy at the University of Massachusetts, who 
has done extensive research on the subject, 
says that in group situations, there is a diffu-
sion of responsibility; people look for cues 
from others before deciding how to act. “Just 
being aware of this tendency and saying ‘I 
am responsible’ can make a difference. Peo-
ple who believe that they are responsible for 
other people’s welfare help more.” 
Ullrich didn’t know what he and his 
scouts were in for that day, but mental pre-
paredness and responsibility are central to 
the Boy Scout philosophy. The night before 
the tornado, Ullrich had put the boys 
through a ﬁrst-aid drill. When emergency 
responders arrived after the tornado, what 
they saw was devastating—four scouts were 
dead or mortally wounded. Scores were suf-
fering from broken pelvises, dislocated 
shoulders, lacerations and punctured lungs. 
Yet, amazingly, the rescue crew also saw that 
Ullrich and the uninjured scouts were put-
ting their training to work. They had orga-
nized an on-the-spot triage center, helping 
to prepare the most seriously injured for 
their journey to the hospital. 
By teaching his scouts to leap into action, 
Ullrich skewed the 10-80-10 math of disas-
ter. He saw the drill as part of his responsi-
bility to care for the troop. “The point of it is 
to get these scouts to be the people who 
don’t sit around when something bad hap-
pens,” he says, “but to be the type of people 
who do something.” 
Rule 3: 
Hang in There
On Saturday, Nov. 18, 2007,  
Daryl Jané left his cottage on 
Bainbridge Island in Washington 
State to head for an overnight  
sky-watching event 190 miles southeast at 
Trout Lake. He had planned to be back the 
next day to watch a Seattle Seahawks game. 
Jané never made it to Trout Lake. Instead he 
became the prisoner of a tremendous late 
autumn snowstorm. Jané was driving on a 
widely used—at least in good conditions—
forest service road as the snow began to pile 
up. He became stuck 35 miles from his des-
tination when the tires of his ’93 Jeep Chero-
kee sank into deep snow.  
In the car, Jané had a near-full gallon of 
water, some food for the evening, a Wal-Mart 
sleeping bag and a Seahawks jacket with a 
ﬂeece liner. He was certain he’d be rescued 
the next day, but no one came. He knew he 
shouldn’t leave the shelter of his vehicle to 
look for help, so he stayed with the Jeep and, as the days 
passed, settled into a survival routine. He slept in ﬁts and 
starts so he could keep brushing the snow off his door and 
the roof in case a search helicopter came looking for him. (In 
fact, the local sheriff had called off the search after the ﬁfth 
day, convinced Jané was not in the area.)
After eight days, Jané was seriously dehydrated. He was 
literally buried in frozen water, but he knew that it would do 
him more harm than good. “I had read somewhere not to 
eat snow if you were stuck,” he says. He was correct: It low-
ers the core temperature of the body, which then must 
expend precious energy to keep warm. Yet his head ached, 
his teeth felt fuzzy, and his tongue and lips were cracked—
he had to ﬁnd water or die. Eventually, he wrote a goodbye 
note to his family and friends and set out with his empty gal-
lon jug to search for water.
Jané struggled through the 5-foot-deep snow until he 
noticed a depression. He dug through it with a cup, and 

      
P H O T O G R A P H  B Y  P H I L I P  F R I E D M A N /  S T U D I O  D
discovered water. He drank an entire gallon. “It was the 
greatest feeling,” he says, still recalling the ﬁrst sip vividly. 
“I could feel that water going through my body. It was like 
I was the Tin Man being oiled.” Once he got back to his 
Jeep he put away his pen and goodbye note. The water he 
found kept him alive and gave him hope as the snow con-
tinued to fall day after day.
In the end, Jané was stuck for 14 days before a local 
snowmobile club found him. He had lost 10 pounds but 
had suffered from neither frostbite nor hypothermia.
Jané’s survival story is, of course, amazing. But is it 
miraculous? According to John Leach, the former RAF 
instructor turned survival psychologist, it 
shouldn’t be. “Unfortunately, people in 
his situation die all the time, but they 
don’t have to,” Leach says. “He didn’t have 
food, but that’s not a problem for two 
weeks—you can live without it. Fluid is the 
issue, but he found water.” What really 
saved Jané, Leach says, is that he adapted 
to his environment; he understood that he 
was in trouble and changed his behavior. 
“Being aware of your surroundings and 
recognizing the threats means your brain 
is working on solutions,” Leach says, “and 
that gives you an edge.” That awareness 
starts your brain modeling a plan to keep 
yourself alive and help in your own rescue, 
instead of remaining in denial about the 
problem or simply panicking.
Steve Leslie, a 20-year veteran of Wash-
ington State–based Olympic Mountain 
Rescue, has seen countless people get lost 
or stranded in the woods. He sees long-
term wilderness survival as a challenge of 
maintenance. “Basically it’s housekeep-
ing—your chances of survival go way up if 
you maintain a good shelter, find water 
and, if you have any food, parcel it out.”
Jané created a survival routine and 
stuck to it: He avoided desperate actions 
and stayed with his vehicle, kept the roof 
clear to increase the odds of being found 
and, most important, never gave up. By 
facing reality—he was stuck and might be 
there a long time—and adapting to it, 
Jané set himself up for the slow, disci-
plined work of long-term survival.
Rule 4:
Outlast the Aftermath
Last September, a 600-mile-
wide hurricane named Ike 
carved through the Caribbean
with wind speeds of up to 145
mph before slamming into Texas near 
Houston. As a direct result of the storm, 
48 people in Texas died. 
But, according to a report by the 
National Hurricane Center, the aftermath 
proved to be deadlier than the storm itself. 
As many as 64 post-storm deaths occurred 
in Texas because of factors such as carbon 
monoxide poisoning and electrocution. 
More than 1 million Texans were left with-
out power. Municipal water systems were 
overwhelmed, and clean water was the 
next to go. Enormous lines formed at 
FEMA food centers, grocery stores and gas 
stations—which had no electricity to

pump what little gas was left. That ﬁrst 
weekend after Ike, some 37,000 Texans 
were holed up in shelters that ran short of 
food and water within 24 hours. The next 
few weeks brought countless scores of 
injuries from clearing debris.
While many in the area were awaiting 
assistance, Mark Vorderbruggen and sev-
eral of his neighbors in the Houston sub-
urb of Spring were already busy cleaning 
up their neighborhood. The crew had orga-
nized before the storm by gathering all the 
two-way Family Radio Service walkie-talkies they could ﬁnd 
and then distributing them among 14 occupied houses. 
They had already taken a quick inventory of residents with 
generators, chain saws and ﬁrst-aid skills (one neighbor 
was a retired Army medic). The day before Ike hit, Vorder-
bruggen went door to door with four or ﬁve guys from the 
neighborhood, serving as an impromptu pickup crew, 
clearing yards of furniture, tools and anything else that 
might turn into a deadly missile in hurricane-force winds.
Thanks to his preparations, Vorderbruggen’s house 
survived largely intact. But there was still plenty of debris 
to clean up in the neighborhood. “Almost every leaf and 
every pine needle on every tree was stripped off,” he says. 
“There was an incredible amount of raking to be done.” 
He and his neighbors all pitched in to clean up every yard 
and sidewalk. 
In times of danger, many people can 
retreat into a defensive crouch, but “every 
man for himself” is a terrible strategy for 
post-disaster situations. Psychologists 
use the term “reciprocal altruism” to 
describe what happens when people over-
come their tendency toward selﬁshness 
and work together. “We tend to extend 
help to others,” says psychologist Andrew 
Shatté, one of the world’s leading experts 
on the psychology of resilience, “on the 
understanding that some ‘other’ will 
expend a few resources to save us.” By 
working together, groups reduce the dan-
ger and stress to individuals. “Once their 
basic survival needs are met,” says Shatté, 
“people like Vorderbruggen instinctively 
reach out to help the community. They 
are more resilient and happier with their 
lives for doing so.”
In fact, for Vorderbruggen and his 
neighbors, the aftermath of Ike was less 
like a disaster and more like a barbecue. 
The area was without power for ﬁve days, 
but the neighbors conserved resources 
by eating meals together at a different 
house each night to ensure that no food 
was spoiled. “We cooked on the grill, and 
I ran a small light off a battery-powered 
electric inverter,” Vorderbruggen says. “I 
got to walk around in Hawaiian shirts and 
swim shorts for nearly a week. Cooking 
outside, clearing debris. It was actually 
kind of fun—for me.”

electricity fails, the ﬂoodwaters begin to rise and the orders for evacua-
tion come, everyone will surely be concerned with stockpiles of food, 
blankets and water, but I’m going to be equally worried about Blu-rays, 
computers, Wii games and cold drinks. After all, I’ve got a modern fam-
ily to provide for. How are we going to maintain our high-
tech lifestyle? I recently decided to design and test a plan 
to keep our gadgetry humming once society collapses.
I created a closed-loop power supply using two 
Exide Orbital gel-cell deep-cycle batteries, an inverter, 
If it were truly the end of the 
world as we know it, wouldn’t 
you want it on video?
The lone LED in this lantern puts 
out powerful light; the battery 
lasts up to 10 hours.
My 6-month-old rocked out to 
Sesame Street songs on this 
portable radio with iPod dock. 
Since this 12-volt fridge ran all 
day long, it was a real battery 
killer, but it kept our beer cold.
This Wi-Fi hotspot with 3G broad-
band connectivity goes wherever 
you want it—a must-have.

720p HDTV used less power than 
a 40-watt light bulb.

! 2  By the next morning, however, both 
batteries were dead, and my beer was get-
ting warm. It was time to break out the fos-
sil fuels: I started the generator and 
attached one battery. Then my stepfather 
and I finished raising the 29-foot wind-
turbine tower and hooked both that and 
the solar array up to the second battery. 
The Yamaha generator took about 
2 hours to charge one of the batteries. (I 
learned later that it is a far better use of the 
1000-watt generator’s power to charge both 
batteries in parallel.) My solar–wind hybrid 
setup, by contrast, took about 6 hours to 
charge a battery. Making power this way is 
a hell of a workout on the arms and shoul-
ders: Our deep-cycle batteries weighed 
40 pounds each and had to be hauled from 
the open field where we were making 
power to our gadget-stuffed bunker. 
! 3 and Beyond  After the ﬁrst few days, 
my family and I settled into a groove, alter-
nating batteries back and forth from the 
solar–wind station, then topping off the 
charge with the generator when the sun 
set. When I wasn’t busy hauling batteries, 
we had plenty of music, movies, Internet 
access and video games to keep us enter-
tained. But I learned to moderate my usage 
of the most power-hungry devices. Accord-
ing to my measurements, the TV and pro-
jector pulled 35 and 41 watts, respectively, 
but generally only ran for an hour or two at 
a time. The fridge, on the other hand, 
sucked up 50 to 60 watts all day long, so we 
unplugged it in the evening.
We got lucky with the sunshine—after 
the initial thunderstorms, we had good 
weather for several days. The wind, how-
ever, was not as reliable. The Air Breeze 
turbine needs at least an 8-mph wind to 
spin; for maximum effectiveness, that 
wind should come from a consistent direc-
tion. Unfortunately, the swirling Hudson 
River Valley breezes spent more time spin-
ning the turbine like a weathervane than 
rotating its blades.
After three and a half days, the genera-
tor ran out of fuel. However, I determined 
that if I were willing to forgo the fridge and 
be a bit more judicious in the use of the 
TV, we could have kept using our electron-
ics as long as the weather held. 
So our tech-survival trial run taught us 
two lessons: First, there is no reason we 
can’t all watch HD movies and play video 
games in the aftermath of society-crushing 
disaster. Second, we will have to make some 
sacriﬁces—get used to warm beer.

For three and a half days, 
PM technology editor Glenn 
Derene and his family  
powered all their gadgets 
with a portable energy farm.
Gasoline 
Generator
Wind  
Turbine
Solar
Array
a small wind turbine, a 60-watt solar array and a portable gasoline genera-
tor. Then I assembled a suite of electronic devices and conveniences 
selected for maximum efﬁciency. I loaded it all into the back of a pickup 
and brought the whole operation, along with my wife and 6-month-old 
son, to my mother’s 17-acre farm in upstate New York. Her property 
seemed well-positioned to harvest power from both wind and sun. 
q! 1  Both batteries were 
fully charged, so on arrival 
I immediately hooked one 
up to our 40-quart Cole-
man thermoelectric fridge 
and stocked it with beer, 
water and soda to ensure 
cold beverages would be 
available as soon as possi-
ble. I also plugged in my 
battery-powered devices 
so that everything would 
be charged up by the time 
I had my solar and wind 
generators ready.  
I assembled the solar 
rig in a half-hour, but the 
wind turbine proved to be 
a more complicated affair. 
I’d love to give an estimate 
of how long it took to 
erect, but I can’t, since the 
project was interrupted by three thunderstorms in 4 
hours, which threatened to deliver a far higher dose of 
natural electricity than I had in mind. So we postponed 
the completion of the turbine until the second morning. 
While waiting out storms, I set up a survival base camp 
in my mother’s living room and made my family vow to 
use only the electronics and power we brought with us. 
Our Internet access was supplied by Verizon’s MiFi 3G 
wireless hotspot, and we tapped into it for e-mail on an 
Acer netbook. We put our son to sleep with lullabies 
played on a Tivoli mini boombox. And when night fell, we 
watched a Blu-ray of Wall-E on a 22-inch HDTV. Since 
many of the devices were operating on their own battery 
power, we were able to get through the ﬁrst evening with-
out having to recharge either of the deep-cycle Orbitals.

(MREs) are the military’s answer 
to a long-term, disaster-proof food 
supply. These vacuum-packed 
foodstuffs—also available in 
civilian versions—require little 
more preparation than activating 
an included heating pad by adding 
water, and have all the nutrition 
necessary to keep you alive. But 
does the taste inspire the will to 
survive? To ﬁnd out, we served up 
civilian MREs from three different 
manufacturers to some of PM’s 
hungriest staffers in a ﬂavor 
face-off. Here’s what the end of 
the world tastes like.

 Food isn’t juﬆ about 
calories. Your disaﬆer 
menu may include MREs or 
canned food, but either 
way, a few extra shelf-
ﬆable ingredients can go a 
long way toward civilizing 
your supper. Don’t forget 
to ﬆock up on ﬂavor-
enhancing items that don’t 
need refrigeration, such as 
ketchup, muﬆard, salt, 
spices, hot sauce, bouillon, 
powdered drink mix and 
chocolate. A few bottles of 
wine wouldn’t hurt either.

repair a dishwasher? In the case of a balky Maytag at Eric Wilhelm’s 
house in Oakland, Calif., one doctorate sufﬁced. After a plastic wheel 
on the dishwasher’s upper rack broke off of its assembly, Wilhelm 
faced a classic consumer conundrum. The same plastic part had bro-
ken and been replaced three times—and now the warranty had 
ended. Considering this history and Wilhelm’s mounting frustra-
tion, repairing the 3-year-old appliance seemed marginally less logi-
cal than buying a new one.
But discarding the machine didn’t feel right to Wilhelm, who is 
the co-founder and CEO of Instructables.com, a website that details 
DIY projects, from simple repairs to elaborate, artsy computer 
mods. Armed with a drill, a vise and a spare stainless-steel bolt, Wil-
helm repaired the wheel and got his rack rolling again—and it 
hasn’t broken since. “From a purely monetary standpoint, it proba-
bly made no sense for me to spend an hour and a half ﬁxing a plastic 
wheel on my dishwasher,” he says. “But I got an intangible reward—
a satisﬁed feeling that I ﬁxed something and didn’t replace it.” 
Not so many decades ago, Wilhelm’s little project wouldn’t have 
seemed noteworthy. Typical American homes were places where 
socks were darned, lawnmowers rebuilt and bushings, gaskets, nuts 
and bolts were transfused into a steady stream of machines that 
needed rehabilitation. By the time I was growing up in the 1970s, 
though, many people had come to look on tinkering as less a sign of 
competence than of deprivation and backwardness. My father, who 
grew up in poverty, probably felt more pride in getting a new washing 
machine delivered than in keeping an old, outmoded one working 
for a few more years. Buying new and buying often were American 
ideals—signs of a modern outlook and success. 
Popular Mechanics readers were among those who never 
stopped building, modifying and ﬁxing the technology in their lives: 
cars, stereos, garden sheds, computers, the occasional wind turbine 
or one-man submarine. But today the repair culture is making a

technology to kite-surﬁng equipment, credits the digital rev-
olution. “You have 20-year-olds who grew up with Microsoft 
Windows, accustomed to complete control and personaliza-
tion,” Grifﬁth says. “They want the same control over their 
physical objects. Repairing and making things does that.” 
Whatever the cause, diverse data points support the con-
clusion that a mechanical revival is underway: the ubiquity of 
home-improvement megastores and even more numerous 
DIY and man-and-machine shows on TV; the rise of websites 
such as FixItClub.com and RepairClinic.com; and the healthy 
trafﬁc at the plans-and-advice section of PopularMechanics
.com and at Instructables. Among this summer’s most widely 
reviewed books was Shop Class as Soulcraft, a manifesto call-
ing for renewed respect for mechanical skills, written by a 
one-time philosophy post-doc turned motor-
cycle mechanic. (Hipsters in Brooklyn carry 
their copies in Crumpler messenger bags as 
they pedal restored Schwinn bikes to welding 
class.) The Internet has fostered communi-
ties of guitarists fixing old Fender amps, 
shade-tree mechanics endlessly rebuilding 
Volvos and steampunk show-offs grafting 
motherboards into antique-looking brass 
and steel contraptions.
Premature Demise
Mr. Jalopy is annoyed. An artist, business 
consultant and used-bike store owner in Los 
Angeles, the self-named tinkerer has become 
an outspoken advocate for keeping old 
machines running. “Repair culture is right in 
line with the rise of sewing, crafting and the 
slow-food movement,” he says. “All of these 
are about engagement with the stuff around 
us.” And he is troubled by the hands-off mes-
sage that many modern products convey. 
Take the Apple iPhone. The battery is sealed 
into the phone, so when the battery goes the 
whole unit is supposed to be returned to 
Apple for an expensive and time-consuming 
replacement. For an indispensable digital 
tool, that’s a death sentence. 
“When a product can’t even be opened, it 
takes away a fundamental aspect of owner-
ship,” Mr. Jalopy says. “If I can’t repair it, 
then who owns it? What I’m buying is tempo-
rary use of an object that will soon [meet its] 
demise.” In a world designed by Mr. Jalopy, 
cases would be easy to open and ease of 
repair would be a primary engineering goal.
There are products made that way—
they’re just not sold in electronics stores. 
Industrial mainstays such as jet airplanes 
and diesel locomotives can stay in service for 
decades, thanks to robust construction and 
maintenance-friendly design. Modular archi-
tecture in Xerox’s commercial-grade copiers 
allows the machines to remain state of the 
art through multiple innovation cycles. Such 
“product life extension” strategies could be 
extended to more consumer products, says 
industrial ecologist and operations manage-
ment specialist V. Daniel Guide Jr., of Penn 
State’s Smeal College of Business. But 
whether people want them is uncertain—
such items often cost more, and people tend 
to choose cheap, disposable goods over 
expensive, long-lasting ones. (For a sampling 
of durable, repairable products, see “Tomor-
row’s Classics,” page 85.) 
Complexities also arise with the question 
of what environmental beneﬁts come from 
ﬁxing, rather than replacing, broken items. 
As the heralds of the DIY resurgence point

out, it takes a lot of energy to mine raw mate-
rials, transform them into useful goods and 
ship those items from warehouses to stores 
to living rooms. “Repair is a small act to save 
money, but it’s also small action to save the 
planet,” Grifﬁth says. 
Broadly speaking, that’s true. But it’s dif-
ﬁcult to determine the total 
environmental impact of a 
product—or just about any 
aspect of modern life. (It 
once took Grifﬁth, who has 
multiple advanced degrees 
and won a MacArthur genius 
grant in 2007, several days
to calculate his own carbon 
footprint.) Researchers who 
study the issue have identi-
fied a distinction between 
faddish electronics and the 
longer-lasting workhorses 
of domestic life. A paper in 
the journal Environmental 
Science 
& 
Technology
reported that it takes 8 gal-
lons of water and 3 pounds 
of fossil fuels and chemi-
cals to build a microchip 
weighing just 2 grams. But 
the chips aren’t used for 
long. “Consumer electron-
ics are designed with six-
month life cycles,” Guide 
says. “All the energy embod-
ied in them is consumed 
during the production phase—very little 
while they’re being used—but we get rid of 
them quickly.” If mobile phones could be 
upgraded rather than replaced, there would 
be a solid environmental payoff. 
In contrast, many an ancient appliance 
could help the environment by retiring from 
service. “A washing machine is designed for a 
20-year life cycle,” Guide says, “and very little 
energy is consumed in its production. Almost 
all of it is used during the life cycle.” New 
models of such appliances tend to be far 
more efﬁcient than their predecessors—so if 
Wilhelm’s dishwasher breaks again when it’s 
10 years old, he might want to dump it.
Machine Code
Malcolm Frazier, 35, of Stratford, Conn., 
learned small-engine repair and a mending 
mind-set from his father. For him, life-cycle 
analyses don’t matter when the wheels come 
off a machine. Fixing the problem just feels 
right—it fulﬁlls a personal code that com-
bines self-reliance with thrift. “I don’t throw 
anything out without trying to ﬁx it ﬁrst,” he 
says. Nothing is too humble—Frazier will replace the broken 
handle on a Swiffer sweeper—but he gets a bigger payoff with 
products like the stereo receiver he ﬁxed not long ago. “I think 
I can usually do a better job than paying someone else to do 
it, and it makes me feel good knowing that receiver would 
have cost $400 to replace. In my mind, I’m ahead $400.”  
For Talbot Hack, 47, of Ann Arbor, Mich., diagnosing a 
leaky coffee maker or replacing the hard drive on a laptop is 
a welcome change from his work as a marketing executive. 
And, he uses repair as a way to connect with his teenagers. “I 
try to instill in my kids that they can feel conﬁdent taking on 
certain tasks,” he says. Recently, he and his son solved an 
engine compression problem on a 20-year-old moped. “The 
lessons my kids learn are: Do a little research beforehand, 
break the problem down, go step by step and don’t give up at 
the ﬁrst sign of trouble,” Hack says. 
In the end, no accounting of monetary savings and carbon 
balances can outweigh the psychic rewards of taking charge 
of a concrete problem and resolving it. Old-school repair hob-
byists and new-school garage hackers seem to agree that 
reanimating a machine or tool bound for the trash heap can 
yield outsize paybacks. “When you repair, there’s satisfaction 
in understanding your world and having power over it,” Grif-
ﬁth says. “You think, I know this machine. I brought it back 
from the grave. It’s a part of me, and I’m a part of it.”

red steel frame of a half-built house, its footprint a jagged stamp 
on the landscape, glints in the sunshine beaming down on Santa 
Clara University. Crawling around the crescent-shaped structure, 
workers holler measurements, fasten sheathing and snap chalk 
lines. They’re wearing hard hats and tool belts, and the noise of 
steel swatting plywood sounds unmistakably like a job site. But 
this is hardly a construction crew out of central casting. Swinging a 
sledgehammer in this gravel lot somewhere between the quad and 
the cafeteria, a student volunteer with arms as skinny as the tool’s 
handle tries in vain to pound a steel spike into the ground. He 
swings, misses and repeats, while the crew snickers. Each stroke 
gets more and more desperate, until, ﬁnally, a cartwheel swing 
sends the kid headlong. His oversized hard hat ﬂies off and the 
crowd cracks up, prompting structural and construction manager 
Dan Ruffoni, a 22-year-old senior at Santa Clara, to intervene. Ruf-
foni sinks the spike in a few clean blows and progress resumes, 
but the sledgehammer slapstick has cost the rookie contractors 
7 precious minutes. They really don’t have 7 minutes to spare. 
The students have been working 100-hour weeks all semester, 
running to the job site after class and dofﬁng hard hats to take 
midterms. So far, they’ve managed to ﬁnance the project and ﬁle 
138 pages of engineering drawings on deadline—not to mention 
pass their exams. But the big deadline, though still months away,

is approaching fast. That’s when the half-clad structure now 
rising from the campus will have to function as a super-
efﬁcient, sun-powered home of the future at the Solar Decath-
lon, in Washington, D.C. Sponsored by the U.S. Department 
of Energy this fall, the competition will pit 20 teams of college 
students against each other in an international showdown of 
innovative engineering. Team California’s young roster tops 
out at age 23, whereas some schools attract Ph.D. candidates, 
or students Ruffoni describes as “old enough to look like 
they’re already in the homebuilding business.” As team 
 project manager Allison Kopf puts it: “We don’t have a con-
struction background. We’re undergrads—we have no back-
ground, period.” But the students don’t see that as a serious  
impediment; if anything, it has increased their drive to win. 
Like many of his teammates, 21-year-old Preet Anand says 
Preet Anand, far le), 
dismantles a mockup 
of the house framing. 
He says Team Califor-
nia’s proje8 can prove 
that renewable energy 
and eﬃcient design 
are “a necessity, not 
a luxury.” Above right, 
sophomore Allison 
Kopf makes cuts a)er 
class while freshman 
Vi8oria Watson holds 
the sawhorses ﬆeady.
he “works on the project full-time and does 
school on the side.” While workers whistle to 
“Layla” from a dusty boombox, Anand, the 
team’s water systems leader, gestures to a 
rec tangle of blue sky visible through the ceil-
ing beams in the asymmetrical structure. 
“We’re putting solar photovoltaics and ﬂat-
plate solar thermal collectors on the roof,” 
he says, “and clerestory windows will provide 
simple daylighting. Our architecture is not 
only performance-driven, we want the house 
to look good.” He describes his team’s strat-
egy as a “young, daring Silicon Valley 
approach”—and it’s not without its chal-
lenges. Window shutters with thin-ﬁlm solar 
collectors along the louvers had to be axed 
because of safety concerns. Certain products 
have proven to be so obscure that it was 
unclear whether they could be shipped to the 
U.S. For other prototypes, students have had

they finally complete it and transport the

planned, 2848-mile journey across the coun-

six days upon arrival at the National Mall. 
Then, they must move into their house for

they’re not just building a solar-powered

host other teams for two dinner parties and 
a movie night.
During the competition, the DOE will 
open the solar village’s 20 homes for public 
tours from Oct. 9 to 13 and Oct. 15 to 18. On 
Oct. 14, expert judges in 10 categories—
including architecture, engineering and 
market viability—will comb through each

ment of the lighting. This year, there’s an 
added twist: The houses will be plugged into

How It Works
where real-time meters will monitor both the amount of 
energy consumed and the power each home feeds back into 
the system. Nationally, meters like these could help utilities 
respond more quickly to power outages or prevent rolling 
brownouts. At the Solar Decathlon, they will keep score—
50 additional points go to houses that generate more energy 
than they consume.
Team California’s heating and cooling system may help 
the house hover near that perfect zero. “Doing all the heating 
and cooling with electricity would take a lot of power from 
our solar panels,” 23-year-old thermal design leader Tim 
Sennott says. So the students drew up an elaborate system in 
which solar thermal collectors heat and cool the house 
through radiant tubing in the ﬂoor and ceiling. An energy-
recovery ventilator maintains a constant indoor temperature 
and humidity, further reducing HVAC demands. “What we 
designed is a whole ton more complicated than something 
we would ever put in a residential home,” Sennott says. 
“We’re trying to do stuff with technology that’s not main-
stream yet.” The tactic can be risky. In July, the supplier of 
the cooling system’s solar-powered absorption chiller pulled 
out, leaving students scrambling for an alternative.
The Solar Decathlon has a precedent of such edgy 
approaches, according to its director, Richard King. Students  
in years past have adopted solar technologies that were

“hardly even heard of at the time,” King says. The compe-
tition gives the public a chance to see these new technol-
ogies work together as a system—some, like California’s 
radiant cooling, for the ﬁrst time. 
Santa Clara’s 2007 Solar Decathlon house, its boxy 
frame crowned with solar panels, stands a short walk from 
the current job site.  In its sunny living room, sitting in a 
chair made from reclaimed wine-barrel staves, Anand 
pulls a tape measure from his back pocket and points to 
handsome bamboo joists along the ceiling. The 2007 team 
wanted to develop bamboo-based structural materials, he 
says. That idea caught the eye of the company Teragren, 
which sent unﬁnished bamboo for the students to test in a 
Tinius Olsen machine—a massive contraption that 
stresses I-beams to evaluate tensile strength and shear-
load capacities. That year, underdog Santa Clara took third 
place. The students’ joists, now certiﬁed under multiple 
international building codes, will soon be on the market. 
“It’s one thing to manufacture a product, but it’s 
another to have it installed in a building that meets code,” 
says Tom Goodham, Teragren’s vice president of opera-
tions. “The beauty of putting products into 
an actual building is that it helps people 
understand it’s not just conceptual. This is 
a material that’s ready to be used, that can 
be integrated into design today.” Working 
with Santa Clara on this year’s house, Tera-
gren revised the joist to create open-web 
ﬂoor trusses. The elegant, trestle- shaped 
bamboo beams have openings to run con-
duit, simplifying installation.
But really, all the cutting-edge technol-
ogy eclipses the core challenge—building 
a house isn’t easy. Try doing it on top of a 
full college course load. Despite the occa-
sional decision Ruffoni describes as “so 
embarrassingly wrong that only students 
would do it,” his teammate Anand credits 
their team’s inexperience as a major asset. 
Unfamiliar with the sobering constraints 
of actual construction, he says, “The only 
thing we had to apply was creativity.”  FC

Laﬆ winter, Conne0icut homeown-
ers Keith Goodrow and Jody Willis 
began looking into ways to cut their 
fuel bills. Goodrow, a civil engineer, and 
Willis, a veterinarian, were spending 
about $3000 a year on fuel oil to heat 
their ranch home and to produce hot 
water. Looking for a way to trim that 
number, they decided to follow the 
lead of a neighbor who had inﬆalled a 
ﬆove that burns pellets made from 
wood, or, to be precise, sawduﬆ.  
Oese clean-burning ﬆoves form 
one leg of a dual-fuel ﬆrategy that is 
appealing to growing numbers of 
homeowners concerned with per-
sonal independence, sustainability 
and coﬆ savings. Unlike oil and natu-
ral gas, wood pellets typically are pro-
duced close to where they’re used—
reducing the energy used in 
transportation—and they come from

a renewable resource. Moﬆ compel-
lingly, the pellets are made from a saw-
mill waﬆe produ;—no trees are cut 
juﬆ to manufa;ure them. 
>en there’s the coﬆ advantage: 
Oil and natural gas are tightly tied to a 
global syﬆem that’s sensitive to politi-
cal disruptions and reﬁnery-damaging 
hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, both 
of which can cause prices to spike. (An 
online calculator maintained by Penn 
State helps homeowners compare the 
coﬆs of various fuels: energy.cas.psu
.edu/costcomparator.html.) Federal 
tax credits are helping to make such 
stoves more attractive as well. Tax-
payers can receive a credit of 30 per-
cent, up to $1500, for the purchase 
and inﬆallation of a 75 percent eﬃ-
cient biomass-burning ﬆove in 2009 
or 2010. By leaving a conventional sys-
tem in place, homeowners can hedge 
their bets—at times, fossil fuels may 
well be less expensive than pellets. 
“What drove our decision was the eco-
nomics,” Goodrow says. He expects 
the $6000 investment in the stove, 
including its installation and a large 
bulk fuel purchase, will pay for itself in 
less than three years.
In the Hopper
A pellet ﬆove is simpler to operate 
than a classic wood-burning ﬆove, but 
it’s certainly not as hands-oﬀ as a con-
ventional furnace. “Our whole culture 
is built around giving the consumer 
produ;s that you can plug in and for-
get,” says Dan Freihofer, vice president 
of operations for PelletSales.com, a 
pellet provider. “But the pellet ﬆove 
takes a little more involvement. You’ve 
got to ﬁll it every day, and clean the 
ash out every few days. >e archetypal 
owner is someone who isn’t daunted 
by a little technology—an engineer or 
someone who likes to tinker.” >ere 
are two basic ﬆove types: inserts that 
fit into a fireplace and freestanding 
models, like the Lopi Leyden that 
Goodrow and Willis bought. >is ﬆove 
produces 45,100 Btu per hour, roughly 
matching the output of a small resi-
dential boiler or furnace—enough to 
heat 2250 square feet of living space.
>e homeowner pours pellets into 
the hopper and tinkers with settings to 
determine how faﬆ the fuel will burn, 
and thus how much heat it will throw 
off. Some stoves can even be con-
ne;ed to a wall thermoﬆat, allowing 
you to turn the heat up or down as 
though it were a furnace. When the 
ﬆove is in operation, an ele;rically driv-
en auger meters fuel into the ﬁre pot. 
>e fuel is ignited and hot combuﬆion 
gases wind their way through a tubular 
heat exchanger at the top of the burn 
chamber. >e gases transfer their heat 
to the exchanger and are then pulled 
outside by an exhauﬆ blower. Air from 
the room is pulled through the heat 
exchanger and warmed before dis-
charging into the room. 
Depending on the burn rate, a ﬆove 
will run anywhere from several hours to 
all day before its hopper needs another 
load of fuel. Each pellet is an energy-
dense sawduﬆ extrusion that meas-
ures about ¼ inch in diameter and 
¾ inch long. The average household 
uses between 2 and 3 tons per heating 
season. Laﬆ winter a ton of pellets (50 
40-pound bags) coﬆ about $200 to 
$275—providing, that is, you could ﬁnd

them. #e pellet induﬆry got a sooty 
black eye over the laﬆ few seasons 
in regions where demand outﬆripped 
supply. #e producers and retailers 
say they have ﬁxed the problem for 
this year with better production 
methods and logistics. Just to be 
sure, many stove owners started 
placing orders in the spring. Some 
groups of owners started pooling 
their orders to buy a whole traAor-
trailer load of fuel at a time—bringing 
down the price while ensuring they’d 
have pellets once the temperature 
drops. “Supply looks dramatically 
better this year,” Freihofer says. 
“Supply will exceed demand.”
Hole in the Wall
To see how these heaters go in, I 
visited Goodrow and Willis to help 
the dealer inﬆall their Leyden ﬆove—
and tried not to get in the way. #e 
process turned out to be ﬆraightfor-
ward. Firﬆ, the two-man crew from 
Dean’s Stove and Spa, in Plantsville, 
Conn., set down a UL-liﬆed hearth 
pad with a pedeﬆal base that would 
raise the 400-pound stove about 
7½ inches above the ﬂoor. Next, we 
located wall ﬆuds, and temporarily 
set the stove in place to decide 
where to run the vents through the 
wall without hitting any ﬆuds. 
With the vent locations deter-
mined, we moved the stove and 
bored a pilot hole as the center mark 
for the exhauﬆ vent. Next, we cut 
the interior wall surface with a dry-
wall saw. Outside, we used a recip-
rocating saw to remove wood siding 
and sheathing and fitted the wall 
thimbles into their holes. #is hard-
ware provides a noncombustible 
surface to pass the exhauﬆ pipes 
through. We used essentially the 
same method to inﬆall a fresh-air 
intake vent, which would supply out-
door air for combustion. Then we 
fastened all the exterior vent sur-
faces to the siding and caulked with 
high-temperature sealant. 
Back inside, we set the ﬆove on 
the hearth pad and conneAed the 
vents. #e fresh-air vent conneAs to 
the ﬆove bottom with a ﬂexible cor-
rugated vent pipe, while rigid metal 
pipe runs from stove to exhaust. 
Finally, we attached the hard-wired 
thermoﬆat, which comes with the 
ﬆove. (For added convenience, wire-
less remote thermostats are also 
available for about $150.) 
#e inﬆallation done, we plugged 
in the ﬆove and ﬁlled its hopper. #e 
auger delivered pellets to the fire 
pot, and the automatic igniter lit the 
fuel. In no time, the room was glow-
ing with warmth.

Raising Chickens  
            Input / Output
P H O T O G R A P H  B Y  S A R A H  S H A T Z
A
Lots of people with no farming 
background have started raising 
chickens in the past few years, mainly 
to add a satisfying dose of 
self-reliance to their daily 
diet. You can raise chick-
ens anywhere that zoning 
laws don’t prohibit it, from 
a small yard in a rural 
township to the heart of 
many big cities—the proj-
ect doesn’t take much 
space. My first piece of 
advice is to start slow. 
“One of the most common 
mistakes made by novice 
chicken owners is getting 
too many birds too fast,” 
says Gail Damerow, who 
has raised countless chick-
ens and written several 
books on farm-animal 
care, including Storey’s 
Guide to Raising Chickens. 
A laying hen produces an 
egg a day, so it doesn’t 
take more than a couple 
of birds to put breakfast 
on the table. That’s your 
output. As for input, count 
on providing each bird 
with 2 pounds of feed per 
week and 1 to 2 cups of 
clean water a day. (But 
your chicken mileage may 
vary—as Damerow points 
out, “Chickens haven’t 
read the books.”)
The size of your flock 
determines the size of the 
coop you build. If anything, 
err on the side of making 
the ﬆruUure a little larger

Q 
My husband and I are thinking of raising a few 
chickens to provide eggs, but we want to make 
sure we’re not getting in over our heads. Could you 
give us some general guidelines on chicken care and 
building a coop?
Retroﬁt a shed to 
house chickens, or 
build a small coop, 
complete with a 
swing-up hatch that 
leads to a chicken 
yard enclosed by a 
chain-link fence.

When it comes to building the 
ﬆru7ure, a chicken coop is much 
like any small outbuilding. It’s wise 
to keep it simple and inexpensive, 
yet ﬆurdy enough to safely house 
animals. Ae gold ﬆandard of coop 
construction is to pour a slab of 
concrete and ere7 the building on 
that. Ais design is suitable even to 
meet organic poultry ﬆand ards. If 
you’re not concerned about these 
ﬆringent requirements, build the 
base and floor out of pressure- 
treated lumber. 
Finally, check with your local 
agricultural extension office or 
other amateur poultry raisers to 
find out about carnivorous var-
mints that live in your area. Aey 
range from raccoons, skunks and 
weasels to coyotes.  When I was a 
kid, local farmers dealt harshly with 
these critters, usually with a shot-
gun blaﬆ. I’m not embarrassed to 
say that as a young guy who hunted 
on those farms, I had no qualms 
about assiﬆing them. 
Ae times have changed, though. 
Before you pull the trigger on a 
peﬆ, know what your responsibili-
ties are. Laws regarding varmint 
control vary by ﬆate. Ae ﬁrearm 
method aside, take sensible precau-
tions against animal intruders. 
Aose Yankee farmers kept a tidy 
coop. Aey knew that local preda-
tors were stealthy and needed 
cover, so they removed piles of 
brush or rocks from anywhere near 
the coop, and they mowed nearby 
to keep grass short. 
We haven’t dealt with aeﬆhet-
ics here, not a topic normally asso-
ciated with these buildings. Still, I 
don’t see why a coop has to be 
ugly. Ae poultry plans oﬀered by 
North Dakota State University 
Extension Service on its website 
(some going back to the 1930s) 
are particularly attractive exam-
ples. Even if the archite7ural nice-
ties are lost on the birds them-
selves, they won’t be overlooked by 
your neighbors. And if you decide 
some day to leave chicken-raising 
behind, at leaﬆ you’ll be leW with 
an attra7ive ﬆru7ure. Sanitized 
and repainted, the coop could go 
on to a second life as a garden shed 
or to enclose ﬁrewood.
Flood Control 
I live in an old house with a sump 
pump that sits in a murky, muddy 
pit. :e pump failed recently a<er 
the pit partially caved in. I need 
to upgrade the whole setup. 
Where do I ﬆart?
It’s a long shot, but buy a plaﬆic 
sump liner and lid and see if it will 
simply ﬁt in the hole. If it does, ﬁll 
the space between the liner and 
pit wall with clean gravel and 
declare vi7ory.
Assuming that doesn’t work, 
dig a new sump pit. Ais is a tough 
and muddy job that will require a 
stout shovel, a wrecking bar and 
perhaps a posthole digger. You 
may even need to rent a wet-cut-
ting pavement saw or an electric 
jackhammer to remove some of 
the existing basement ﬂoor.
Make the hole large enough to 
surround the plastic sump liner 
with a layer of gravel about 2 to 3 
inches thick. In addition to the plas-
tic sump liner and lid, you’ll need a 
new pump. If the old pump dis-
charged using a makeshiW setup, 
then inﬆall new PVC pipe and a 
back-ﬂow valve. (Search for “Inﬆall-
ing a Sump Pump” at popular 
mechanics.com.)
If the outlet supplying the pump 
is not GFCI-protected, complete 
the inﬆallation with an ele7rical 
upgrade. Inﬆall a GFCI receptacle 
in the pump’s outlet box. Uncom-
fortable with this work? Call in an 
ele7rician.

“You’re not making heat, you’re moving heat,” Colorado geothermal 
inﬆaller Jim Lynch says. Inﬆallations like Lynch’s tap into the earth 
below the froﬆ line—which always ﬆays around 50 degrees Fahren-
heit—to reduce a home’s heating and cooling loads. All HVAC syﬆems 
require energy-intensive heat movement, a task responsible for over 
half of the average house’s total energy demand. Geothermal works 
more eﬃciently because the syﬆem’s mild ﬆarting point creates an 
eﬃcient shortcut to the target temperature. Imagine a 100-degree 
Florida day or a 0-degree Michigan night: Spot the syﬆem 50 degrees, 
and it doesn’t work so hard to get the house comfortable.
Unlike wind and solar, geothermal’s power source never varies.  
Bob Brown, vice president of engineering with equipment maker 
Water Furnace, says, “Se ground’s there all the time. It’s great for 
heating and it’s great for cooling. All I’ve got to do is bury a plaﬆic  
pipe, put ﬂuid in and, lo and behold, I’ve got a great syﬆem.”

fry oil out of tanks behind a 
restaurant, and mixing it 
with lye and methanol in a 
5-gallon bottle before pour-
ing it into an old water heater. 
Two hours later, I opened the valve 
at the bottom of the heater and black 
goo oozed from the hose, a biodegrad-
able subﬆance called glycerin. Before 
long the glycerin drained and gave way 
to a thin, clear, amber liquid: I had my 
ﬁrﬆ batch of biodiesel.  
Young and Fuelish
I made that ﬁrﬆ batch of fuel ﬁve 
years ago. If you faHor in all the time I 
spent making the homebuilt biodiesel 
processor (a converted eleHric water 
heater) and experimenting with the 
design (some batches went, umm, less 
than perfeHly—I had to replace two 
injeHion pumps on my truck), my expe-
rience with DIY fuels was oNen a frus-
trating and, occasionally, very expen-
sive process. 
Since then, the biodiesel induﬆry 
and the technology have 
evolved. With the profes-
sionally engineered biodiesel 
syﬆems available today, the 
process is simpler, safer, takes less time 
and yields more consiﬆent results. So I 
decided to try one of the commercially 
available processors—it came boxed 
with all of the equipment and reagents 
needed to turn out consistent, high-
quality biodiesel fuel. Qe FuelMeiﬆer 
processor used here has five fewer 
valves than the eight in my old home-
made one. It also mixes the lye and 
methanol inside the tank to prevent the 
chance of dangerous spills.

1. Start by ﬁltering 
your waﬆe vegeta-
ble oil to remove 
chunks of food leN 
over from the fryer. 
We used a paint 
ﬁlter. Qe ﬁltrate is 
moﬆly breading, 
with the 
occasional chunk 
of ... something. 
Mix all your oil 
from diﬀerent 
sources to achieve 
a uniform sample.
2. Next we need 
to titrate to see 
how acidic the oil 
is. Add a small 
amount of 
phenolphthalein 
indicator dye to a 
carefully prepared 
mixture of 
methanol and 
sodium hydroxide. 
Add a sample of 
the acidic waﬆe 
oil to the mix  
with a calibrated 
pipette. 
3. Trickle in a 
prepared basic 
reagent until  
the mixture  
ﬆays purple for  
10 seconds of 
swirling. Qe 
quantity of reagent 
you add here 
determines the 
amount of 
methoxide (methyl 
alcohol/sodium 
hydroxide mixture) 
to add to the oil  
to complete the 
transeﬆeriﬁcation 
process. It takes 
some simple math 
or a look-up table 
to calculate  
the amount. 
Yes, you can make biodiesel in a plaﬆic bucket with little 
more than some drain cleaner, gas-line de-icer and a wooden 
spoon, if you know what you’re doing. But it can be danger-
ous. Splashing lye and/or methanol into your eyes can blind 
you. And ele[rical pumps unattended in the presence of 
hundreds of gallons of ﬂammables will make your local ﬁre 
marshall underﬆandably nervous. In addition, poor-quality 
produ[ will damage your very expensive diesel-inje[ion 
pump. Our advice? Research biodiesel produ[ion properly 
before doing the mad-scientiﬆ routine.  — MIKE ALLEN

A Little &eory
 ere’s quite a bit of chem-
iﬆry involved in transform-
ing vegetable oil into biodie-
sel, in a process known as 
transeﬆeriﬁcation. Vegeta-
ble oil (VO) is made up of 
chains of fatty acids held 
together by glycerol mol-
ecules. Methanol breaks 
those chains of fatty acids 
apart. &e corrosive, alkaline 
lye (sodium hydroxide, 
although you can also use 
potassium hydroxide) breaks 
the glycerol (a heavy alcohol) 
off those chains and the 
methanol (a light alcohol) in 
turn takes the place of the 
glycerol, leaving shorter, 
lighter, more combustible 
molecules. &e result is an 
oil that burns well as a direG 
replacement for petroleum-
based diesel fuel, with 12 to 
15 percent glycerin leK over 
at the bottom of the tank. 
&e lye aGs only as a cata-
lyst in this case, and isn’t 
consumed in the process. 
On the other hand, waﬆe 
vegetable oil (WVO) , like we 
get out the back door of res-
taurants, is somewhat acidic 
because it has free fatty 
acids, which are produced 
during heating and cooking. 
Fortunately, that acidity is 
neutralized by the extremely 
alkaline lye essential to the 
transesterification. Adding 
lye converts free fatty acids 
to a form of soap, moﬆ of which will 
drain out with the glycerin. &e remain-
ing soap is removed in the wash. Of 
course, we have to be sure that the 
amount of alkaline lye is juﬆ enough to 
counterbalance the acidity, or we wind 
up with poor-quality fuel.
Biodiesel in PraGice 
You can’t make biodiesel if you don’t 
have a couple of high-quality reﬆau-
rants in your area. Greasy spoons need 
bottom of the 
vessel in a few 
hours, where you 
can drain it out. 
6. Allow the fuel  
to air out for a day 
or two with the  
top oﬀ to let any 
cloudiness (caused 
by a small amount 
of remaining  
water) dissipate.
5. Drain the glycerin 
from the bottom 
until you get 
lighter-colored, 
thinner biodiesel 
pouring from the 
valve. Qen use 
water to wash the 
excess methanol, 
lye and soapy 
residue from the 
biodiesel. Qe water 
will settle to the 
4. Heat your oil to 
120 F,  then add the 
calculated amount 
of methanol/
hydroxide mixture. 
Qe FuelMeiﬆer 
processor we used  
conveniently lets 
you do the  
methanol/lye mixing 
inside a tank 
mounted to the lid. 
Agitate for an hour 
by running the 
transfer-pump hose 
back into the vessel. 
At this point the oil 
will have been 
converted into 
biodiesel. Allow the 
heavier glycerin  
to settle out for  
a few hours.
not apply. That’s because the more 
pure the WVO is, the better the biodie-
sel. Reﬆaurants that overcook their 
food, don’t change their oil frequently 
or cook lots of frozen food will have oil 
with high free-fatty-acid content. 
As for water, less is better. As little 
as 5 percent in the WVO 
can leave you with a batch 
of soapy glop instead of 
biodiesel in your processor.  
You don’t want to deal with the mess 
of cleaning up, so care in selecting 
feedﬆock will pay oﬀ in the long run. 
Heat a couple of ounces of the WVO in 
a frying pan. If it sizzles, there’s too 
much water. This water can be 
removed by heating the oil to above 
220 degrees in an open container, and 
then letting it cool down. But that con-
sumes a lot of energy, and you’ll need 
to baby-sit the whole business because 
of the danger of ﬁre. Beﬆ juﬆ to ﬁnd 
higher-quality WVO.
Busy restaurants are like food-
cooking assembly-lines. &ey heat their 
oil at the same time, at the correG 
temperature, and fry about the same 
amount of food every day. &ey also 
change their cooking oil at the same 
time and in the same way every week.

Other places aren’t as careful, and their 
oil gives me less, and poorer quality, 
biodiesel per batch. I get almoﬆ all my 
WVO from two local reﬆaurants, and 
I’ve never had water in the oil. Biodiesel 
processing has become popular. Res-
taurants used to be thrilled when I took 
the old oil away without charging them. 
Now WVO is a commodity not unlike 
crude oil. When regular diesel is about 
$2.50 a gallon, I pay $0.30 per gallon. 
When diesel was $4.85 a gallon, I paid  
$0.60 a gallon.
Doing the Math
The 40-gallon processor we used 
here costs nearly three grand. We 
saved about $1.20 a gallon over the 
current price of petro-diesel, if you 
don’t count the $2995 price tag for the 
processor. Rat means we’d have to 
make 62 or more batches to pay back 
the inveﬆment, or one batch every six 
days—for a year. A couple of batches 
can be fun, but spending every Satur-
day with greasy hands can get to be a 
chore. You’ll also need to set up a place 
to ﬆore the WVO, the methanol and 
the biodiesel, all of which are ﬂamma-
ble, and a place to work. Don’t forget 
you’ll also need to dispose of leYover 
poor-quality WVO, a fair amount of 
glycerin and the occasional batch of 
glop. There’s an excess of methanol 
and alkali remaining aYer the transes-
teriﬁcation, and commercial biodiesel 
producers recover the methanol and 
use it for the next batch. Your local 
authorities may have an opinion as to 
the  proper, legal disposal of glycerin.
You’ll ﬆill need to run a fair amount 
of conventional mineral diesel in your 
tank along with your home-brew fuel, 
especially in the winter when low tem-
peratures turn even the best-quality 
biodiesel into jello. 
Also, the current crop of direct- 
inje]ion diesels don’t fare well on con-
centrations of bio higher than 10 per-
cent. Why? To thermally purge the 
diesel particulate ﬁlter (DPF), the injec-
tion syﬆem periodically inje]s fuel into 
the cylinder during the exhauﬆ ﬆroke 
to raise exhaust temperatures high 
enough to ignite the carbon inside the 
DPF. Re carbon simply burns oﬀ, leav-
ing the DPF ready to filter out more  
particles. Biodiesel, more viscous than 
mineral diesel, sticks to the cylinder 
walls and washes paﬆ the rings into 
the crankcase. This can dilute the 
engine oil, potentially causing engine 
damage. Moﬆ car manufa]urers pro-
hibit the use of more than 10 percent 
biodiesel if you expect any warranty 
prote]ion. Biodiesel works beﬆ in  older 
diesel vehicles with precombustion- 
chamber mechanical inje]ion. 
Caveats aside, you can make diesel 
fuel sustainably while also reducing 
pollution. Getting a good supplier of 
WVO when fuel prices are low should 
ensure an adequate supply when 
demand  rises. Biodiesel stores very 
well in a cool, dry place if you squirt a 
little nitrogen from a welding supply 
shop into the top of the barrel. Making 
a lot of the ﬆuﬀ now might be one way 
to have your own little inveﬆment in 
home-brew biodiesel futures as regular 
diesel prices climb.

Here’s a little-known secret—
many of the relays used on most 
cars are identical, whether they are 
used for the fuel pump, the headlights, 
the fans or the rear-window defroster. 
It’s a standard 30-amp SPDT relay. He 
probably repurposed a relay from some 
other circuit on your car, like the 
foglamps or the rear defroster, and 
plugged it into the fuel-pump relay 
socket. I’m just impressed that he fig-
ured out it was the relay in such a short 
time. (Sounds like the voice of experi-
ence.) It’s easy to tell which relay is 
which. Relay positions, as well as fuse 
positions and values, are listed in the

My 4x4 quit suddenly, on the side of a mountain. My wife and 
I were looking at a potential 20-mile hike, until a guy on an 
ATV came by and ﬁxed it in 5 minutes—without any parts. How  
did he know, and what did he do? He moved this little box-shaped 
thing in the fuse box underhood from one place to another.
Poked a hole in your gas 
tank on a rock? 
 Stuﬀ a wedge from a bar of  
 soap into the hole.  It’ll laﬆ 
long enough to get into town. 
Or a few hundred yards paﬆ 
that ﬆream you need to ford.
Punched a hole in the oil 
pan with a stone?
 Whittle a plug from a twig  
 and hammer it into the hole.  
Trim oﬀ the excess so the plug 
doesn’t catch on the next rock.
But now you don’t have enough 
oil to reﬁll the crankcase. 
 Add a quart of  water.  Really.

I’m Melting
I’ve had to replace the radiator in 
my truck twice and the heater core 
three times in the laﬆ ﬁve years 
because of corrosion. I use fresh 
antifreeze, but it doesn’t seem to 
help. What’s happening here?
If fresh coolant, changed every other 
year, isn’t holding the corrosion at 
bay, look for one of two problems. 
Firﬆ, the combuﬆion gases could 
be leaking into the cooling syﬆem 
through a bad intake manifold gas-
ket, head gasket or a cracked head 
or block. You can chase that by sniﬀ-
ing the radiator neck with the probe 
of an exhaust-gas analyzer. If you 
can deteE any carbon monoxide in 
the radiator, it’s a sure sign there’s 
exhauﬆ leaking in.
Second, the corrosion problem 
could be eleErical. Measure the volt-
age between the battery ground and 
the liquid in the radiator. Juﬆ dip the 
voltmeter probe into the coolant 
without touching the side of the ﬁller 
neck. If the meter indicates any more 
than a few hundred millivolts—bad 
news, dude. I’d ﬆart by replacing all 
of the ground wires and clamps con-
necting the battery to the engine 
block as well as to the frame and 
body of the vehicle. Remember, 
you’ve got a cooling syﬆem with sev-
eral dissimilar metals (iron, copper 
and aluminum are all common in 
engines, radiators and heater cores) 
wetted with an electrolyte. That 
essentially creates a big battery, and 
the eleErolysis can eat through thin 
radiator tubes in short order.
Clutching Techniques
I had to replace the clutch slave 
unit on my 2003 Ford F-150. Fe 
mechanic wanted to know how I 
drove the truck. I said that when I 
ﬆop for traﬃc lights, I usually leave 
it in gear with my foot on the clutch 
pedal. He said that this praJice 
might have caused the slave unit to 
fail. I’ve been driving manual 
transmission cars and trucks for 
some 30 years and have never had 
a problem with the clutch before. 
What is the right way to drive a 
manual truck or car? Leave it in 
gear with my foot on the clutch 
pedal or take it out of gear and 
keep my foot oﬀ of the clutch pedal 
when I am ﬆopped?
I dare say moﬆ of the vehicles you’ve 
driven, unless they were either a 
tiddlywink-size sports car or a big 
rig, didn’t have a hydraulic clutch like 
your late-model F-150. So you may 
not have seen this problem in the 
paﬆ. Moﬆ American iron uses a pure 
Starting next year  
it should be simpler to 
comparison shop for tires. 
He NHTSA is proposing a 
new label be aﬃxed to the 
sidewall of every new tire. 
He label (which hasn’t 
been ﬁnalized yet) will 
show a tire’s rolling 
resiﬆance (rolling 
resiﬆance has a direS 
eﬀeS on fuel economy), 
wet traSion and wear 
resiﬆance in an easy-to 
assimilate form. Since 
1976, tread-wear ratings 
have been liﬆed on tire 
sidewalls, in tiny raised 
print. Unfortunately, the 
current ratings are not 
consiﬆent among tire 
manufaSurers, making it 
impossible to compare the 
relative tread-wear of tires 
from diﬀerent companies. 
He new ratings are 
induﬆry ﬆandard, and the 
easy-to-digeﬆ label should 
make it easier to compare 
and shop.  — M.A.

mechanical linkage, or maybe 
a cable. Regardless, keeping 
your foot on the pedal while 
ﬆopped, or in motion for that 
matter, is poor pra;ice. 
First, there’s a safety 
issue: Leaving the truck in 
gear might make it easier to 
lurch into traﬃc if you sneeze 
or lose your concentration 
and release the clutch pedal. 
On a more mechanical level, 
the pra;ice keeps hydraulic 
pressure on the slave cylin-
der, shortening the life of the 
seals. It also keeps the 
throw-out bearing spinning. 
Unlike any other bearing in 
the drivetrain, this bearing 
doesn’t have liquid motor oil, 
ATF or gear lube conﬆantly 
circulating paﬆ it. Je throw-
out bearing is lubed by a 
scant spoonful of grease 
sealed inside. When this 
bearing fails, the ﬁrﬆ ﬆep in 
repairing it is to remove the 
transmission from the car, 
which isn’t easy or cheap. 
Outmoded 
What’s the replacement for 
Type A transmission ﬂuid?
Type A automatic transmis-
sion fluid (ATF) was a GM 
specification for transmis-
sion fluid back when they 
ﬆill used buggy whips. Well, 
not exa;ly: It was ﬁrﬆ used 
in 1947 when GM started 
selling cars with modern 
automatic transmissions. 
Type A ATF was superceded 
by Dexron in 1967, and then 
by Dexron II and Dexron III. 
Some power-ﬆeering units, 
convertible-top hydraulic sys-
tems and even outdoor pow-
er equipment still specify 
Type A. You should be able 
to substitute Dexron III in 
moﬆ applications that spec-
ify Type A. If you’re really 
compulsive about an older 
vehicle’s diet, you can find 
true Type A from some 
smaller manufa;urers if you 
hunt around.

where the paper clip comes in handy. 
Unfold it and hook one end through 
the metal spring in the negative end of 
the empty slot. 9en take the other 
end and bend it so it touches the metal 
conta; on the outside of the tray at 
the positive end of the same slot.
9is clip will a; as a sort of On/Oﬀ 
switch—as long as it is touching both 
the spring and the metal contact, 
 power will be ﬂowing and the charger 
will be on. To turn the charger off,  
simply move one end of the paper clip 
away from one of the conta;s. 
Hook Up the Power
For our contraption to work, you 
need to conne; the tray to the phone 
battery. 9e tray will have two wires 
running from it: A red wire carrying cur-
rent from the positive battery terminal, 
and a black one carrying current back 
to the battery’s negative terminal. 
Crimp or solder a red alligator clip to 
the red wire, and a black alligator clip 
to the black wire. If a voltmeter is avail-
able, hooking your clips to it can con-
ﬁrm that your batteries are providing 
the corre; voltage.
Now look closely at the phone bat-
tery. It will have a series of small metal 
conta;s that it uses to suck up elec-
tricity. 9ere should be a positive (+) 
sign next to one of them, and a nega-
tive (−) next to another. (Note that 
moﬆ phone batteries contain three or 
more conta;s, but you can juﬆ ignore 
the reﬆ of them. And if they don’t have 
positive or negative markings, a volt-
meter will tell you which is which.)
Taking care to make sure the two 
clamps don’t come into conta; with 
each other, clasp the red alligator 
clamp to the side of the battery so that 
its metal jaws are touching the posi-
tive metal contact, and the black 
clamp to the side of the battery so that 
it’s touching the negative one. 
Your battery is now charging. But 
be warned: Since this makeshiX mech-
anism has no built-in way of limiting 
the current or guarding againﬆ over-
heating, you’ll want to keep an eye 
(and a finger) on it to make sure it 
doesn’t get too hot. If the phone bat-
tery starts to heat up, unplug it 
immedi ately, or you could damage it. 
And there are other reasons why you 
should only try this if you have no other 
choice: 9e process could violate your 
phone’s warranty, and the sharp alliga-
tor clips can scratch up a battery’s 
plaﬆic shell. And, to be safe, I wouldn’t 
recommend using this method to 
charge your battery for more than  
10 minutes at a time. When you’re 
done, put the battery back in the 
phone and ﬆart dialing.

car, takes minutes and uses parts that 
can be found at Radio Shack for a total 
of less than $5.
To do it yourself, you’ll need the fol-
lowing: a few AA batteries, a four- AA-
battery tray, a metal paper clip and 
two alligator clips. 9at’s it, and the ﬁn-
ished produ; should be able to charge 
juﬆ about any phone (with the notable 
exception of the iPhone, which does 
not have an easily removable battery) 
if you ﬁnd yourself in the wilderness or 
waiting out a power outage. 
Check the Voltage
,e ﬁrﬆ ﬆep is to check the voltage 
on your phone battery. Moﬆ clock in at 
about 3.7 volts, but you should pop it 
out of the phone and read the ﬁne print 
to see for sure. 9is information will let 
you calculate how many AA batteries 
you need. 9e key is to use enough to 
barely exceed the phone battery’s volt-
age—employ fewer and you won’t be 
producing enough juice to charge the 
battery, but hook up too many and you 
could burn out the whole thing. AA bat-
teries are 1.5 volts each, so charging  
a 3.7-volt battery requires combining 
three of them for a total of 4.5 volts.
Pop the batteries into the AA tray. 
It’s a four-battery tray, so you’ll need to 
put something else in the laﬆ AA slot 
in order to complete the circuit. 9is is

Compared to other USB devices, 
external hard drives are power 
hogs—they oUen require more juice 
than older laptops are capable of 
delivering through a single USB jack. 
When it’s conne?ed to a computer 
through a double-ended Y cable, the 
hard drive is able to suck up a double 
dose of power through two USB 
slots simultaneously.
However, because newer laptops 
are able to deliver more power 
through each USB jack, you may not 
a?ually need the Y cable. ^e only 
way to know for sure: Try plugging it 
in with a single USB cable. If your 
hard drive works, you can probably 
get by with conne?ing it to that com-
puter using any old USB cable.

1. Raceway Pond
!is 2000-square-foot, 
rubber-lined pond produces 
25 pounds of dry algae 
a day. Rather than grow 
“designer” ﬆrains, Sprouse 
uses native algae. “We get 
seeding through the air and 
water,” he says. !ough his 
crop has lower energy-rich 
lipid content than geneti-
cally modiﬁed algae, it’s 
easier to grow. Sprouse’s 
long-term goal: Scale up to 
a 25-acre farm that would 
produce 14,000 pounds of 
dry algae per day. 
2. Centrifuge   
!e algae solution enters 
as 99 percent water; it 
exits as 60 percent algae. 
Sprouse is designing  
a ﬁlter press that would  
use less energy. 
3. Fertilizer Tanks  
Sprouse uses two tanks—
one full of diluted pig excre-
ment, high in phosphorus 
and potassium, and one 
containing nitrogen-rich 
urea—to create fertilizer. 
4. Algae Coal Oven   
Algae paﬆe is cooked for 
several hours, under pres-
sure, inside this 55-gallon 
drum—producing granules 
that are non-water-soluble 
and can be ﬆored outdoors. 
“It’s a drop-in replacement 
for coal,” he says. Unlike 
coal ash, algae ash contains 
no mercury or lead and can 
be applied to farm ﬁelds.
5. Harvester   
Positioned at the terminus 
of the raceway, the  
harveﬆer houses a pump 
that pulls water through 
ﬁlters, which extraU a 
diluted algae solution. !e 
water is then recycled to 
grow more algae. Sprouse 
invented the device.

When Jes Sprouse was a kid, he used to watch mile-long 
coal trains rumble across the Wyoming plains, headed for the 
power plants his ironworker father had helped to build. Now, he is in the energy business 
himself, but inﬆead of coal he focuses on algae farming. So far, his operation is limited to 
a single pond in his front yard, but he’s got big plans: to fuel America as a tycoon of algae 
pellets (for home use) and algae coal (for power plants). Both produPs yield 10,500 Btu 
per pound—nearly as much energy as bituminous coal. And they’re a lot cleaner. “I’ve 
known for a long time that our path is unsuﬆainable,” he says. “Farming algae is environ-
mentally driven, but I also want to make money.”  — PAUL TOLMÉ
