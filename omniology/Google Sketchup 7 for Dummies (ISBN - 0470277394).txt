About the Author
Aidan Chopra has always had a thing for computers — his parents thought-
fully sent him to Apple camp instead of hockey lessons like every other 
eight-year-old in Montreal — but he learned to draft and build physical 
models the old-fashioned way, working for his architect father. These days, 
Aidan is a Product Evangelist at Google, where he’s been since that company 
bought SketchUp in the first part of 2006. In the five years since he gradu-
ated with a Master of Architecture degree from Rice University, he’s done a 
lot of writing and lecturing about the way software is used in design. Aidan 
writes the SketchUpdate, a monthly e-mail newsletter that reaches over a 
million SketchUp users worldwide. He has taught architecture at the uni-
versity level and at Google and works on ways to mediate between power 
and usability. He believes the best software in the world isn’t worth a darn 
if nobody can figure out how it works. Aidan is based in Boulder, Colorado, 
even though he is what many would consider to be the diametric opposite of 
a world-class endurance athlete.

Dedication
For my parents, Jenny and Shab, and my brother, Quincy, because I love 
them very much.
Acknowledgments
For helping in all the ways that it is possible to help with a book — offering 
technical advice, lending a critical ear, providing moral support and encourage-
ment — I’d like to thank Sandra Winstead. It’s rare to find everything you need 
in a single person, and I can’t imagine having written this book without her.
I’d like to thank Chris Dizon for agreeing to be the Technical Editor for this 
volume; I can’t think of anyone who brings more enthusiasm and curiosity 
to everything he does. As a dyed-in-the-wool SketchUpper who uses the soft-
ware even more than I do, I knew he’d do a bang-up job of keeping me honest, 
and he did.
I thank Kyle Looper, Becky Huehls, John Edwards, and Tonya Cupp, my editors 
at Wiley, for making what I fully expected to be a painful process not so at all. 
It was a delight to work with a team of such intelligent, thoughtful, and well-
meaning professionals; I only hope I’m half as lucky on the next book I write.
Finally, I need to thank the very long list of individuals who provided critical 
help. From clearing the way for me to be able to write this book to patiently 
explaining things more than once, I owe the following people (and almost 
certainly a few more) a whole lot: Tommy Acierno, Brad Askins, John Bacus, 
Brian Brewington, Brian Brown, Todd Burch, Chris Campbell, Mark Carvalho, 
Chris Cronin, Steve Dapkus, Jonathan Dormody, Bil Eberle, Joe Esch, Rich 
Feit, Jody Gates, Toshen Golias, Scott Green, Barry Janzen, Tyson Kartchner, 
Chris Keating, Patrick Lacz, Mark Limber, Scott Lininger, Allyson McDuffie, 
Millard McQuaid, Tyler Miller, Parker Mitchell, Simone Nicolo, Steve Oles, 
Bruce Polderman, Alok Priyadarshi, Peter Saal, Brad Schell, Matt Simpson, 
Mike Springer, Tricia Stahr, Bryce Stout, Daniel Tal, James Therrien, Mason 
Thrall, Nancy Trigg, Tushar Udeshi, John Ulmer, David Vicknair, Greg Wirt,

Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies

Introduction
A
 couple years ago, I was teaching a workshop on advanced SketchUp 
techniques to a group of extremely bright middle and high school (or 
so I thought) students in Hot Springs, Arkansas. As subject matter went, I 
wasn’t pulling any punches — we were breezing through material I wouldn’t 
think of introducing to most groups of adults. At one point, a boy raised his 
hand to ask a question, and I noticed he looked younger than most of the 
others. Squinting, I read a logo on his T-shirt that told me he was in elemen-
tary school. “You’re in sixth grade?” I asked, a little stunned. These kids were 
motoring, after all. The boy didn’t even look up. He shook his head, double-
clicked something, and mumbled, “Third.” He was 8 years old.
SketchUp was invented back in 1999 by a couple of 3D industry veterans (or 
refugees, depending on your perspective) to make it easier for people to see 
their ideas in three dimensions. That was it, really — they just wanted to 
make a piece of software that anyone could use to build 3D models. What I 
saw in Arkansas makes me think they were successful.
Before it was acquired in 2006 by Google, SketchUp cost $495 a copy, and it 
was already a mainstay of architects’ and other designers’ software toolkits. 
No other 3D modeler was as easy to understand as SketchUp, meaning that 
even senior folks (many of whom thought their CD/DVD trays were cup 
holders) started picking it up. These days, SketchUp is being used at home, 
in school, and at work by anyone with a need to represent 3D information the 
way it’s meant to be represented: in 3D. Google SketchUp (as it’s now called) 
is available as a free download in six languages and is just as popular interna-
tionally as it is in North America.
About This Book
The thing I like least about software is figuring out how it works. I once saw a 
movie where the main character acquired knowledge by plugging a cable (a 
rather fat cable, actually) into a hole in the back of his head. A computer then 
uploaded new capabilities — languages, martial arts, fashion sense (appar-
ently) — directly into his brain. Afterward, the character ate a snack and took 
a nap. That’s how I wish I could get to know new software.

Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies 
This book, on the other hand, is a fairly analog affair. In it, I do my best to 
guide you through the process of building 3D models with SketchUp. I wrote 
this book for people who are new to 3D modeling, so I don’t assume you 
know anything about polygons, vertices, or linear arrays. The nice thing is 
that the people who make SketchUp don’t assume you know any of those 
things, either. That means I don’t have to spend many words explaining 
theoretical concepts, which I think we can both appreciate.
I don’t think many people want to use software just for the sake of using soft-
ware. You probably didn’t learn to drive just because you thought seatbelts 
and turn signals were cool; I’m betting you wanted to be able to get around 
in a car. People use SketchUp so that they can build 3D models. As such, 
most of this book focuses on what you can do with SketchUp, and not what 
SketchUp does. Naturally, this has a few implications:
 
✓ I use the word you a lot. You’re reading this book because you have 
something you want to build in 3D on your computer, and you think 
SketchUp can help you do that. I try to keep this in mind by letting you 
know how you can use the features I talk about to do what you want to do.
 
✓ I err on the side of architecture. The fact is, a lot of people want to 
use SketchUp to model buildings, so I’m assuming that a good many of 
you (the collective you, in this case) want to do the same. You can use 
SketchUp to build just about anything you want, but to ignore the fact 
that it’s extra-great for architecture would be silly.
 
✓ I don’t cover everything SketchUp can do. If this book were about 
SketchUp, and not modeling with SketchUp, I would list every feature, 
every tool, and every command in exhaustive detail. I would tell you 
exactly what every radio button and slider bar is for. I would, in effect, 
just copy the documentation that comes with SketchUp (available in the 
Help menu) and call it a day. In writing this book, I had to make a tough 
choice: I had to figure out what to show you and, more importantly, 
what to leave out. The Table of Contents I settled on is a list of what 
most people want to know, most of the time.
 
 Just in case you’re interested, here’s what didn’t make the cut (and why):
 
• The Dimension and Label tools: I left these out because they’re 
so simple to use that I didn’t think they needed any explanation. 
That’s not to say they’re not great — they are. It’s just that this 
book could only be so long.
 
• The 3D Text tool: Why’d I leave this one out? Like the Dimension 
and Label tools, it’s too easy to use. Just try it out and you’ll see 
what I mean.

 Introduction
 
• Style Builder: Because it’s a separate program that comes with 
SketchUp Pro 7, I decided not to dive into Style Builder. You use it 
to create your own Styles for SketchUp; learn more about Styles in 
Chapter 9.
 
• Ruby: Actually, I do talk a little bit about Ruby, but only in Chapter 
17, which is practically at the end of the book. Ruby is a scripting 
(programming) language that you (maybe) can use to code your 
own tools for SketchUp. I think that says it all, don’t you?
One more thing: Because SketchUp is a cross-platform program (meaning that 
it’s available for both Windows and Macintosh computers), I make reference 
to both operating systems throughout this book. In most cases, SketchUp 
works the same in Windows and on a Mac, but where it doesn’t, I point out 
the differences. Just so you know, any figures in this book that show the 
SketchUp user interface show the Windows version.
Foolish Assumptions
I mentioned earlier that I don’t presume you know anything about 3D modeling, 
much less 3D modeling with SketchUp, in this book. That’s true — you’re 
safe even if you call SketchUp “Sketch’em-Up” (which I’ve heard more than 
once, believe it or not). If you happen to know a thing or two about SketchUp, 
I think you’ll still find plenty of useful stuff in this book. Even though it’s 
written with beginners in mind, I’ve included a lot that definitely isn’t 
beginner-level information. I mean for this book to be useful for people with 
just about any level of SketchUp skill.
That said, I assume you’re familiar with a few important concepts. To begin 
with, I assume you know how to work your computer well enough to under-
stand how to do basic things like saving and opening files. I don’t cover those 
things in this book because SketchUp handles them just like every other 
program does. If you’re trying to model with SketchUp and figure out how to 
use a computer at the same time, Wiley has some excellent books that can 
help you out, such as Windows Vista For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone, or Mac 
OS X Leopard For Dummies, by Bob LeVitus, just to name two; visit www.
dummies.com for other options.
Next, I take for granted that you have, and know how to work, a mouse with 
a scroll wheel. SketchUp all but requires you to have a scroll wheel mouse — 
especially when you’re just starting out. The good news for folks who don’t 
have one is that they’re fairly cheap. Just look for something with a left 
button, a right button, and a little scroll wheel in the middle.

Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies 
Finally, I assume you have at least occasional access to the Internet. Don’t 
panic! Unlike most Google applications, you don’t have to be online to use 
SketchUp — I do most of my best work on airplanes, in fact. You can find 
some great resources on the Web, though, and I point them out when I think 
they’re important.
How This Book Is Organized
Tell me if you think this is strange: I read most computer books in completely 
random order. I never start at the beginning and work my way through. In 
fact, I only pick them up for two reasons:
 
✓ To figure something out: I like to have a book on hand when I’m 
beginning something new because I like the way books work. If I need 
help, I look it up, but something else invariably happens — I end up 
reading more than I needed to, and I usually end up finding out some-
thing I didn’t even know I didn’t know. That almost never happens when 
I use digital media; it’s too good at providing me with just the answer to 
my question. Computers are lousy for browsers like me.
 
✓ To kill time: I hate to admit this, but I don’t usually keep my computer 
books anywhere near my computer. I keep them in the bathroom, 
because my bathroom has excellent light for reading and because I’m 
afraid that a television would fall in the bathtub and electrocute me. 
When I’m just killing time, I open my book to a random page and start 
reading.
Despite these two facts, this book does have structure. Basic concepts are 
grouped in the first few chapters, and more advanced material appears 
toward the end. Chapter 3 is entirely devoted to a step-by-step approach to 
getting started, just for those who like to get to know software that way.
In general, though, this book is intended to be a reference. If you keep 
reading from this page on, right to the end of the index, you’ll have a pretty 
good idea of how to use SketchUp to make 3D models — but that isn’t what 
I’m expecting you to do. I recommend that you start with Chapters 1 and 2, 
just to get your bearings. After that, you should use the Table of Contents or 
the index to find what you’re looking for; then proceed from there.
To make it easier to understand how certain chapters are related, this book 
lumps them together into parts. Check out the following summaries to get an 
idea of what’s in each one.

 Introduction
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp
If you’re completely new to SketchUp and 3D modeling, this is the most 
important part in this book. Start here, lest you get frustrated and decide to 
use these pages to line your rabbit coop. Chapter 1 talks about how SketchUp 
fits into the bigger 3D modeling picture. Chapter 2 lays out all — that’s 100 
percent — of the basic concepts you need to understand to do anything 
useful with SketchUp. Chapter 3 offers a basic end-to-end workflow for 
creating and sharing a model. You can skip it, but I think it’s a nice way to 
ease into the program.
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp
SketchUp is a 3D modeling tool, so this part is, in Shakespeare’s eternal 
words, “where it’s at.” Chapter 4 dives right into using SketchUp to make 
buildings, with an emphasis on drawing and extruding simple plans, modeling 
stairs, and constructing roofs. This isn’t easy, mind you, but it’s what a lot of 
people want to use SketchUp to do, so I put it right at the beginning.
Chapter 5 deals with using groups and components, two of the most important 
elements in any SketchUp model you make. Chapter 6 deals with tools you 
can use to manage big models, and Chapter 7 lays out advanced techniques 
for modeling things like terrain, characters, and other non-boxy objects. In 
Chapter 8 I talk about using photographs in SketchUp. The second part of the 
chapter is all about SketchUp’s photo-matching feature, which I guarantee 
will make you smile.
Part III: Viewing Your Model 
in Different Ways
Making models in SketchUp is only half the fun. The chapters in this 
part present some of this software’s truly unique presentation features. 
Chapter 9 dives into Styles and Shadows. Also, don’t skip the last part of 
Chapter 10 on using sections to create animations — it’s easy and more 
rewarding than almost anything else you can do in SketchUp.

Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies 
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made
These chapters are dedicated to getting your models out into the world. 
In Chapter 11 I talk about using SketchUp with Google Earth, which, if you 
haven’t tried it, is reason in itself to have a fast Internet connection. Chapters 
12 and 13 deal with printing and exporting images and movies from your 
model files. Chapter 14 is an introduction to LayOut. This whole-new pro-
gram, which is included as part of SketchUp Pro, is for creating 2D presenta-
tion documents that automatically link to your 3D models.
Part V: The Part of Tens
My favorite thing about books in the For Dummies series is the way they 
embrace people’s love of lists. I could have spread the information contained 
in these ultra-short chapters throughout the entire book, but it’s so much 
easier to read when it’s all in one place, don’t you think?
Chapter 15 is a list of ten things that you’ll definitely struggle with when 
you’re first using SketchUp; remember to check here before you do anything 
drastic. Chapter 16 lists great add-ons that’ll make your SketchUping more 
enjoyable, and Chapter 17 is all about where to turn when the information 
you need isn’t in this book.
On the Web site
I created a little online presence for this book in order to be able to share 
more information with you. This book’s Web site (www.dummies.com/go/
SketchUp7FD) includes lots of useful stuff:
 
✓ A Bonus Chapter: The previous edition of Google SketchUp For Dummies 
included a whole chapter on exporting 2D and 3D vector information 
with SketchUp Pro. That information is still relevant, but I cut it out of 
this book to make room for new features in SketchUp 7. The good news 
is that you can get the whole chapter in digital form on the Web site.
 
✓ Videos: I recorded about six dozen videos and put them up on YouTube. 
They’re pretty basic (just me talking and modeling) but seeing SketchUp 
in action is often very helpful — black and white pictures can only 
convey so much. All my videos are also embedded in this book’s Web 
site, and they’re organized by chapter and section to make them easier 
to find.

7
 Introduction
 
✓ Color images: It often helps to be able to see a figure in color, so I put 
color versions of some of the images in this book online.
 
✓ SketchUp files: These are actually stored on the Google 3D Warehouse 
(which you can find out about in Chapters 5 and 11), but I link to them 
to make them easier to find.
 
✓ Links to other cool resources: There’s a world of great SketchUp 
material — plugins, components, models, blogs — out there, and you 
can find direct links to many of them on my Web site.
Icons Used in This Book
 
This icon indicates a piece of information I think will probably save you time.
 
When you’re working in SketchUp, you need to know a lot of things. I use the 
Remember icon to remind you of something I cover earlier in the book, just in 
case you might have forgotten (or skipped) it.
 
Everyone’s a little bit of a nerd sometimes, and paragraphs that bear this icon 
indulge that nerdiness. You can skip them without fear of missing anything 
important, but reading them can give you something to annoy your SketchUp 
friends with later on.
 
When you see this icon, pay special attention. It occurs rarely, but when it 
does, something you do could harm your work.
 
This icon denotes a spot where you can find supporting material on this 
book’s companion Web site, including videos, sample files, and links to helpful 
material, which you can find at www.dummies.com/go/SketchUp7FD.
 
I revised this book to cover SketchUp 7, but instead of adding a section at 
the beginning that lists everything that’s new, I added the information 
throughout — I think it makes more sense that way. This icon denotes what’s 
new or different in the new version.
If you’d like to see a complete list of new features and improvements in 
SketchUp 7, open your Web browser of choice and try doing a Google search 
for new in SketchUp 7 — something gloriously list-like will no doubt appear.

Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies 

Part I
Getting Started 
with SketchUp

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is dedicated to helping you get 
your bearings. It’s not a step-by-step guide to starting 
a new file in SketchUp; instead, it provides a little bit of 
information about what SketchUp is, what you can use it 
to do, and how to get the most out of it.
Chapter 1 is a very general overview of Google SketchUp. I 
try not to bore you with too much background informa-
tion, but here’s where you can read about what the soft-
ware is supposed to let you do, how it compares to other 
3D modeling applications, and where everything is.
In Chapter 2, I jump right in. There are a few things about 
SketchUp you absolutely need to know when you’re just 
getting started, and here’s where I lay them out. I think 
this is the most important chapter in this book; read it, 
and you’ll know more about SketchUp than millions of 
other folks who already use it every day.
The contents of Chapter 3 are included for the benefit of 
those readers who like to learn software by getting their 
hands dirty right away. The whole chapter is a workflow 
that takes you through the process of making a simple 
model, changing the way it looks, and creating an image of 
it that you can keep forever.

In This Chapter

▶ Comparing SketchUp with other 3D software
▶ Finding out what you can and can’t do with SketchUp
▶ Looking around the application
O
nce upon a time, software for building three-dimensional (3D) models 
of thing like buildings, cars, and other stuff was hard to use. I mean 
really hard — people went to school for years to learn it. And if that wasn’t 
bad enough, 3D modeling software was expensive. It was so expensive that 
the only people who used it were professionals and software pirates (people 
who stole it, basically). Then along came SketchUp.
Operating under the assumption that lots of people might want — and need — 
to make 3D models, the folks who invented SketchUp decided to design a 
program that worked more intuitively. Instead of making you think about 3D 
models as complex mathematical constructs (the way computers think), they 
created an interface that lets you build models using elements you’re already 
familiar with: lines and shapes.
So do you need to know how to draw to use SketchUp? In the latest version of 
the software, not really. Traditional drawing is about translating what you see 
onto a flat piece of paper: going from 3D to 2D, which is hard to do for most 
people. In SketchUp, you’re always in 3D, so no translation is involved — you 
just build, and SketchUp takes care of stuff like perspective and shading for you.
This first chapter is about putting SketchUp in context: why Google offers it 
for free, how it compares to other 3D software, and what you can (and can’t) 
do with it. In the last part of the chapter, I give a quick tour of the program, 
just to let you know where things are.

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Things You Ought to Know Right Away
Before I continue, here’s some information you might need:
 
✓ You get SketchUp by downloading it from the Internet. Just type 
http://sketchup.google.com into your Web browser and read 
through the first page of the Google SketchUp Web site. Click the links 
to download the application to your computer, and then follow the 
installation instructions on the Web.
 
✓ SketchUp works in Windows and Mac OS X. Google SketchUp is 
available for both operating systems, and it looks (and works) about 
the same way on both.
 
✓ A Pro version is available. Google offers a Pro version of SketchUp 
(called Google SketchUp Pro) that you can buy if you need it. It includes 
a few terrific features that folks like architects, production designers, 
and other design professionals need for exchanging files with other 
software. SketchUp Pro also includes a whole separate application 
for creating presentation documents with your SketchUp models. It’s 
called LayOut, and it’s the subject of Chapter 14. If you think you might 
need Pro, you can download a free trial version at http://sketchup.
google.com.
Where SketchUp Fits in Google’s World
A long time ago, somebody invented photography (hey — this isn’t a history 
book), and all of a sudden there was a way to make pictures of things that 
didn’t involve drawing, engraving, or painting. Nowadays, you can’t throw 
a rock without hitting a photograph of something. Everything (it seems) can 
take pictures, including people’s phones. Photography is the main way that 
visual information is communicated.
But what comes after photography? Google (and just about every science-
fiction writer who ever lived) thinks it’s 3D, and here’s why: You live in 3D. 
The furniture you buy (or build) is 3D, and so is the route you take to work. 
Because so many of the decisions you need to make (buying a couch, finding 
your way) involve 3D information, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to experience 
that information in 3D?
Software like SketchUp lets you see 3D information on a 2D screen, which is 
good, but affordable 3D printers and holography (yep, holograms) are just 
over the horizon. All that’s left is to build a model of every single thing in the 
world — and guess who’s going to do it?

13
 Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp
You. By making SketchUp free for everyone, Google is leading the 3D charge. 
Rather than relying on a small number of 3D nerds to get around to modeling 
everything in the universe, Google made SketchUp available to anyone who 
wants to participate. After all, Google is about organizing the world’s informa-
tion — not creating it. By giving SketchUp away, the company has created a 
whole new kind of information to organize. Chapter 11 is all about SketchUp 
and Google Earth, as well as the Google 3D Warehouse, where the world’s 3D 
information is being stored — at least for now.
Comparing SketchUp to Other 
3D Modeling Programs
If you’re reading this book, I presume you’re at least interested in two things: 
building 3D models and using SketchUp to do so. The following sections 
tell you something about how SketchUp compares to other 3D modeling 
programs — how long it takes to figure out how to use it and what kind of 
models it produces.
Jumping right in
When it comes to widely available 3D modeling software, it really doesn’t get 
any easier than SketchUp. This software has been as successful as it has for 
one reason, and it has everything to do with how quickly people are able to 
get good enough at SketchUp to build something within a couple of hours of 
launching it for the first time. You have no thick manuals to read, no special 
geometric concepts to understand; modeling in SketchUp is about grabbing 
your mouse and making something.
So how long should it take you to discover how it works? It depends on your 
background and experience, but in general, you can expect to be able to 
make something recognizable in under four hours. That’s not to say you’ll be 
a whiz — it just means that SketchUp’s learning curve is extremely favorable. 
You don’t need to know much to get started, and you’ll still be picking things 
up years from now. In fact, I’ve learned a couple of things just writing this 
book.
But is SketchUp easy? Lots of people say so, but I think it’s all relative. 
SketchUp is without a doubt easier than any other modeling program I’ve 
tried, but 3D modeling itself can be tricky. Some people catch on right away, 
and some folks take longer. But I can say this for sure: If you want to build 3D 
models, and you have an afternoon to spare, there’s no better place to start 
than SketchUp.

14
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Understanding the difference 
between paper and clay
Three-dimensional modeling software comes in two basic flavors: solids and 
surfaces. Figure 1-1 and the following points illustrate the difference:
 
Figure 1-1: 
SketchUp 
models are 
hollow.
 
Surface models are hollow
Solid models are solid
 
✓ SketchUp is a surfaces modeler. Everything in SketchUp is basically 
made up of thin (infinitely thin, actually) surfaces — these are called 
faces. Even things that look thick (like cinder-block walls) are actually 
hollow shells. Making models in SketchUp is a lot like building things out 
of paper — really, really thin paper.
 
 Surface modelers like SketchUp are great for making models quickly, 
because all you really need to worry about is modeling what things look 
like. That’s not to say that they’re less capable; it’s just that they’re 
primarily intended for visualization.
 
✓ Using a solids modeler is more like working with clay. When you cut 
a solid model in half, you create new surfaces where you cut; that’s 
because objects are, well, solid. Programs like SolidWorks, Form●Z, and 
Inventor create solid models.
 
 People who make parts — like mechanical engineers and industrial 
designers — tend to work with solid models because they can use 
them to do some pretty precise calculations. Being able to calculate the 
volume of an object means that you can figure how much it will weigh, 
for example. Also, special machines can produce real-life prototypes 
directly from a solid-model file. These prototypes are handy for seeing 
how lots of little things are going to fit together.
An important point to reinforce here is that there’s no “best” type of model-
ing software. It all depends on three things: how you like to work, what you’re 
modeling, and what you plan to do with your model when it’s done.

15
 Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp
 
When I said (a few paragraphs ago) that 3D modeling programs come in two 
basic flavors, I sort of lied. The truth is, you can split them into two groups 
another way as well: by the kind of math they use to produce 3D models. You 
can find polygonal modelers (of which SketchUp is an example) and curves-
based modelers. The former type uses straight lines and flat surfaces to define 
everything — even things that look curvy, aren’t. The latter kind of modeler 
uses true curves to define lines and surfaces. These yield organic, flowing 
forms that are much more realistic than those produced by polygonal modelers, 
but that put a lot more strain on the computers that have to run them — and 
the people who have to figure out how to use them. Ultimately, it’s a trade-off 
between simplicity and realism.
What You Should (and Shouldn’t) 
Expect SketchUp to Do
Have you ever been to a hardware store and noticed the “multitool” gizmos 
on the racks next to the checkout stands? I once saw one that was a combina-
tion screwdriver, pliers, saw, tape measure, and (I swear) hammer. I some-
times wonder whether the hardware-store people put them there as a joke, 
just to make you feel better about standing in line.
I generally don’t like tools that claim to be able to do everything. I much 
prefer specialists — tools that are designed for doing one thing really well. In 
the case of SketchUp, that one thing is building 3D models. 
Here’s a list of things (all model-building-related) that you can do with 
SketchUp:
 
✓ Start a model in lots of different ways: With SketchUp, you can begin a 
model in whatever way makes sense for what you’re building:
 
• From scratch: When you first launch SketchUp, you see nothing 
except a little person standing in the middle of your screen. If you 
want, you can even delete him, leaving you a completely blank 
slate on which to model anything you want.
 
• In Google Earth: Chapter 11 goes into this in detail. Basically, you 
can bring an aerial photograph of any place on Earth (including 
your home) into SketchUp and start modeling right on top of it.
 
• From a photograph: The second part of Chapter 8 talks all about 
how you can use SketchUp to build a model based on a photo of 
the thing you want to build. It’s not really a beginner-level feature, 
but it’s there.

16
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
• With another computer file: SketchUp can import images and 
CAD (computer-aided drawing) files so that you can use them as a 
starting point for what you want to make.
 
✓ Work loose or work tight: One of my favorite things about SketchUp is 
that you can model without worrying about exactly how big something 
is. You can make models that are super-sketchy, but if you want, you can 
also make models that are absolutely precise. SketchUp is just like paper 
in that way; the amount of detail you add is entirely up to you.
 
✓ Build something real or make something up: What you build with 
SketchUp really isn’t the issue. You only work with lines and shapes — 
in SketchUp, they’re called edges and faces — so how you arrange them 
is your business. SketchUp isn’t intended for making buildings any more 
than it is for creating other things. It’s just a tool for drawing in three 
dimensions.
 
✓ Share your models: After you’ve made something you want to show off, 
you can do a number of things, which you can discover in detail in Part IV:
 
• Print: Yep, you can print from SketchUp.
 
• Export images: If you want to generate an image file of a particular 
view, you can export one in any of several popular formats.
 
• Export movies: Animations are a great way to present three-
dimensional information, and SketchUp can create them easily.
Is it a toaster or a bungalow?
SketchUp models are made from two basic 
kinds of geometry: edges (which are straight 
lines) and faces (which are 2D surfaces bound 
by edges). That’s it. When you use SketchUp to 
draw a bunch of edges and faces in the shape 
of a staircase, all SketchUp knows is how many 
edges and faces it has to keep track of, and 
where they all go. There’s no such thing as a 
stair in SketchUp — just edges and faces.
That said, there’s a brand new development 
in SketchUp 7: Dynamic Components are pre-
programmed objects that know what they are. A 
dynamic staircase, for example, is smart enough 
to know that it should add or subtract steps 
when you make it bigger or smaller. Dynamic 
Components are a big step for SketchUp; 
all of a sudden, there’s a class of stuff in the 
program that has (what software types would call) 
intelligence. What’s that mean for you? For 
starters, SketchUp is easier to pick up than 
it’s ever been. I go on and on about Dynamic 
Components in Chapter 5.
With the exception of Dynamic Components, 
though, things in SketchUp don’t have any idea 
what they’re supposed to represent. Coming to 
this realization has the tendency to freak some 
people out. If you want a model of something, 
you have to make it out of edges and faces. The 
thing to remember is that SketchUp was created 
to let you model anything, not just buildings, so 
its tools are designed to manipulate geometry. 
That’s good news, believe it or not, because it 
means that you’re not restricted in any way; you 
can model anything you can imagine.

17
 Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp
 
• Export other 3D model formats: With the Pro version of SketchUp, 
you can share your model with other pieces of software to create 
CAD drawings, generate photorealistic renderings, and more.
 
• Upload to the 3D Warehouse: This is a giant, online repository of 
SketchUp models that you can add to (and take from) all you want.
What can’t SketchUp do? A few things, actually — but that’s okay. SketchUp 
was designed from the outset to be the friendliest, fastest, and most useful 
modeler available — and that’s it, really. Fantastic programs are available 
that do the things in the following list, and SketchUp can exchange files with 
most of them:
 
✓ Photorealistic rendering: Most 3D modelers have their own, built-in 
photo renderers, but creating model views that look like photographs 
is a pretty specialized undertaking. SketchUp has always focused on 
something called nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) instead. NPR (as it’s 
known) is essentially technology that makes things look hand-drawn — sort 
of the opposite of photorealism. If you want to make realistic views of 
your models, I talk about some renderers that work great with SketchUp 
in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Animation: A few paragraphs ago, I mentioned that SketchUp can export 
animations, but that’s a different thing. The movies that you can make 
with SketchUp involve moving your “camera” around your model. True 
animation software lets you move the things inside your model around. 
SketchUp doesn’t do that, but the Pro version lets you export to a 
number of different programs that do.
Taking the Ten-Minute SketchUp Tour
The point of this portion of the chapter is to show you where everything is — 
kind of like the way a parent shows a new babysitter around the house before 
leaving for a couple of hours. It’s not meant to explain what anything does, 
per se. I just want you to feel like you know where to start looking when you 
find yourself hunting around for something.
Just like most programs you already use, SketchUp has five main parts. 
Figure 1-2 shows all of them, in both the Windows and Mac versions of the 
program. I describe these parts, plus an additional feature, in the following 
list:
 
✓ Modeling window: See the big area in the middle of your computer 
screen? That’s your modeling window, and it’s where you spend 
99 percent of your time in SketchUp. You build your model there; it’s 
sort of a frame into a 3D world inside your computer. What you see in 
your modeling window is always a 3D view of your model, even if you 
happen to be looking at it from the top or side.

18
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ Menu bar: For anyone who has used a computer in the last 30 years, 
the menu bar is nothing new. Each menu contains a long list of options, 
commands, tools, settings, and other goodies that pertain to just about 
everything you do in SketchUp.
 
✓ Toolbars: These contain buttons that you can click to activate tools and 
commands; they are faster than using the menu bar. SketchUp has a few 
different toolbars, but only one is visible when you launch it the first 
time: the Getting Started toolbar.
 
 If your modeling window is too narrow to show all the tools on the 
Getting Started toolbar, you can click the arrow on the right to see the 
rest of them.
 
✓ Dialog boxes: Some programs call them palettes and some call them 
inspectors; SketchUp doesn’t call them anything. Its documentation 
(the SketchUp Help document you can get to in the Help menu) refers to 
some of them as managers and some as dialog boxes, but I thought I’d 
keep things simple and just call them all the same thing: dialog boxes.
 
✓ Status bar: You can consider this your SketchUp dashboard, I suppose. 
It contains contextual information you use while you’re modeling.
 
✓ Context menus: Right-clicking things in your modeling window usually 
causes a context menu of commands and options to open. These are 
always relevant to whatever you happen to right-click (and whatever 
you’re doing at the time), so the contents of each context menu are 
different.

Although the following items aren’t part of the SketchUp user interface (all the 
stuff I just listed in the previous list), they’re a critical part of modeling in 
SketchUp:
 
✓ A mouse with a scroll wheel: You usually find a left button (the one you 
use all the time), a right button (the one that opens the context menus), 
and a center scroll wheel that you both roll back and forth and click 
down like a button. You should get one if you don’t already have one — 
it’ll improve your SketchUp experience more than any single other thing 
you could buy.
 
✓ A keyboard: This sounds silly, but some people have tried to use 
SketchUp without one; it’s just not possible. So many of the things you 
need to do all the time (like make copies) involve your keyboard, so 
you’d better have one handy if you’re planning to use SketchUp.
Hanging out at the menu bar
SketchUp’s menus are a pretty straightforward affair; you won’t find anything 
surprising like “Launch Rocket” in any of them, unfortunately. All the same, 
here’s what they contain:
 
✓ File: Includes options for creating, opening, and saving SketchUp files. 
It’s also where to go if you want to import or export a file, or make a 
printout of your model view.
 
✓ Edit: Has all the commands that affect the bits of your model that are 
selected.
 
✓ View: This one’s a little tricky. You’d think it would contain all the 
options for flying around in 3D space, but it doesn’t — that stuff’s on the 
Camera menu. Instead, the View menu includes all the controls you use 
to affect the appearance of your model itself: what’s visible, how faces 
look, and so on. View also contains settings for turning on and off certain 
elements of SketchUp’s user interface.
 
✓ Camera: Contains controls for viewing your model from different angles. 
In SketchUp, your “camera” is your point of view, literally.
 
✓ Draw: Includes tools for drawing edges and faces in your modeling 
window.
 
✓ Tools: Most of SketchUp’s tools are contained here, except of course for 
the ones you use for drawing.
 
✓ Window: If you’re ever wondering where to find a dialog box you want 
to use, this is the place to look; they’re all right here.

20
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ Plugins: You can get extra tools for SketchUp — little programs that 
“plug in” to it and add functionality. Some of them show up here after 
they’re installed. Chapter 16 has some information on these.
 
✓ Help: When you’re stuck, and this book isn’t helping (heaven forbid), 
check out the Help menu. It’s the gateway to SketchUp salvation.
Checking the status bar
Even though the big part in the middle is the most obvious part, there’s 
plenty more to the modeling window that you should know about:
 
✓ Context-specific instructions: Most of the time, you check here to see 
what options might be available for whatever you’re doing. Modifier 
keys (keyboard strokes that you use in combination with certain tools 
to perform additional functions), step-by-step instructions, and general 
information about what you’re doing all show up in one place: right 
here.
 
✓ The Measurements box: The Measurements box is where numbers 
show up (to put it as simply as I can). Chapter 2 goes into more detail 
about it, but the basic purpose of the Measurements box is to allow you 
to be precise while you’re modeling.
Where are all the tools?
The Getting Started toolbar contains a small 
subset of the tools that you can use in SketchUp. 
The thinking (which I agree with, incidentally) 
is that seeing all the tools right away tends 
to overwhelm new users, so having a limited 
selection helps people out.
To get access to more tools (through toolbars, 
anyway — you can always access everything 
through the menus), you do different things, 
depending on which operating system you’re 
using:
 ✓ Windows: Choose View➪Toolbars. The 
mother lode! I recommend starting off with 
the Large Tool Set to begin with, and then 
adding toolbars as you need them (and as 
you figure out what they do).
 ✓ Mac: Choose View➪Tool Palettes➪Large 
Tool Set. To add even more tools, right-click 
the Getting Started toolbar (the one right 
above your modeling window) and choose 
Customize Toolbar. Now drag whatever 
tools you want onto your toolbar, and click 
the Done button.

21
 Chapter 1: Meeting Google SketchUp
 
✓ Status indicator icons: SketchUp 7 has three little icons that appear in 
the lower-left corner of your screen. They change to tell you things 
about your model, and you can click them to find out what they do. The 
most important one to note (this early on in your SketchUp tutelage) is 
the one that looks like a question mark. When you click it, it opens the 
Instructor dialog box, which contains information about the tool you’re 
currently using.
Taking a peek at the dialog boxes
Most graphics programs have a ton of little controller boxes that float around 
your screen, and SketchUp is no exception. After the dialog boxes are open, 
you can “dock” them together by moving them close to each other, but most 
people I know end up with them all over the place — me included. Dialog 
boxes in SketchUp contain controls for all kinds of things; here are some of 
the ones that I think deserve special attention:
 
✓ Preferences: While the Model Info dialog box (see the next point) 
contains settings for the SketchUp file you have open right now, the 
Preferences dialog box has controls for how SketchUp behaves no 
matter what file you have open. Pay particular attention to the Shortcuts 
panel, where you can set up keyboard shortcuts for any tool or com-
mand in the program.
 
 On the Mac, the Preferences dialog box is on the SketchUp menu, which 
doesn’t exist in the Windows version of SketchUp.
 
 Some changes to the Preference settings don’t take effect until you open 
another file or restart SketchUp altogether, so don’t worry if you can’t 
see a difference right away.
 
✓ Model Info: This dialog box is, to quote the bard, the mother of all 
dialog boxes. It has controls for everything under the sun; you should 
definitely open it and take your time going through it. Chances are, the 
next time you can’t find the setting you’re looking for, it’s in Model Info.
 
✓ Entity Info: This little guy is small, but it shows information about 
entities — edges, faces, groups, components, and lots of other things — 
in your model. Keeping it open is a good idea, because it helps you see 
what you have selected.
 
✓ Instructor: The Instructor only does one thing: It shows you how to 
use whatever tool happens to be activated. While you’re discovering 
SketchUp, you should keep the Instructor dialog box open off to the 
side. You can also open it at any time by clicking the little “?” icon in the 
Status bar, at the bottom of your screen.

hen you were learning how to drive a car, you probably didn’t just 
get behind the wheel, step on the gas, and figure it out as you went 
along. (If you did, you probably have bigger things to worry about than 
getting started with SketchUp.) My point is, you should really know several 
things before you get started. This chapter is dedicated to introducing 
those things — concepts, really — that can make your first few hours with 
SketchUp a lot more productive and fun.
So here’s the deal: I’ve divided this chapter into three main parts:
 
✓ The first part talks about edges and faces — the basic stuff that SketchUp 
models are made of.
 
✓ The second part deals with the way SketchUp lets you work in 3D (three 
dimensions) on a 2D (flat) surface — namely, your computer screen. 
Understanding how SketchUp represents depth is everything when it 
comes to making models. If you’ve never used 3D modeling software 
before, pay close attention to the middle part of this chapter.

24
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ The final part of this chapter is all about the things you need to do all 
the time — things like navigating around your model, drawing lines, 
selecting objects, and working with accurate measurements.
It’s All about Edges and Faces
In SketchUp, everything is made up of one of two kinds of things: edges and 
faces. They’re the basic building blocks of every model you’ll ever make.
 
Collectively, the edges and faces in your model are called geometry. When 
someone (including me) refers to geometry, we’re talking about edges and 
faces. Other modeling programs have other kinds of geometry, but SketchUp 
is pretty simple. That’s a good thing — there’s less to keep track of.
The drawing on the left in Figure 2-1 is a basic cube drawn in SketchUp. 
It’s composed of 12 edges and 6 faces. The model on the right is a lot more 
complex, but the geometry’s the same: It’s all just edges and faces.
 
Figure 2-1: 
SketchUp 
models are 
made from 
edges and 
faces.

Living on (with, actually) the edge
Edges are lines. You can use lots of different tools to draw them, erase them, 
move them around, hide them, and even stretch them out. Here are some 
things you ought to know about SketchUp edges:
 
✓ Edges are always straight. Not only is everything in your SketchUp 
model made up of edges, but all those edges are also perfectly straight. 
Even arcs and circles are made of small straight-line segments, as shown 
in Figure 2-2.

25
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
Figure 2-2: 
Even curved 
lines are 
made up 
of straight 
edges.
 
Straight edges
 
✓ Edges don’t have a thickness. This one’s a little tricky to get your head 
around. You never have to worry about how thick the edges in your 
model are because that’s just not how SketchUp works. Depending on 
how you choose to display your model, your edges may look like they 
have different thicknesses, but your edges themselves don’t have a built-
in thickness. You can read more about making your edges look thick in 
Chapter 9.
 
✓ Just because you can’t see the edges doesn’t mean they’re not there. 
Edges can be hidden so that you can’t see them; doing so is a popular 
way to make certain forms. Take a look at Figure 2-3. On the left is a 
model that looks rounded. On the right, I’ve made the hidden edges vis-
ible as dashed lines — see how even surfaces that look smoothly curved 
are made of straight edges?
 
Figure 2-3: 
Even 
organic 
shapes and 
curvy forms 
are made up 
of straight 
edges.
 
These edges are smoothed, but still there

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Facing the facts about faces
Faces are surfaces. If you think of SketchUp models as being made of tooth-
picks and paper (which they kind of are), faces are basically the paper. 
Here’s what you need to know about them:
 
✓ You can’t have faces without edges. To have a face, you need to have at 
least three coplanar (on the same plane) edges that form a loop. In other 
words, a face is defined by the edges that surround it, and those edges 
all have to be on the same, flat plane. Because you need at least three 
straight lines to make a closed shape, faces must have at least three 
sides. There’s no limit to the number of sides a SketchUp face can have, 
though. Figure 2-4 shows what happens when you get rid of an edge that 
defines one or more faces.
 
Figure 2-4: 
You need 
at least 
three edges 
to make a 
face.
 
 
✓ Faces are always flat. In SketchUp, even surfaces that look curved are 
made up of multiple, flat faces. In the model shown in Figure 2-5, you 
can see that what looks like organically shaped surfaces (on the left) 
are really just lots of smaller faces (on the right). To make a bunch of 
flat faces look like one big, curvy surface, the edges between them are 
smoothed; you can find out more about smoothing edges in Chapter 6.
 
Figure 2-5: 
All faces are 
flat, even 
the ones 
that make 
up larger, 
curvy 
surfaces.
 
Each of these triangles is perfectly flat

27
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
✓ Just like edges, faces don’t have any thickness. If faces are a lot like 
pieces of paper, they’re infinitely thin pieces of paper — they don’t have 
any thickness. To make a thick surface (say, like a 6-inch-thick wall), you 
need to use two faces side by side.
Understanding the relationship 
between edges and faces
 
Now that you know that models are made from edges and faces, you’re most 
of the way to understanding how SketchUp works. Here’s some information 
that should fill in the gaps (and also check out additional resources on this 
book’s companion Web site; see the Introduction for details about the site):
 
✓ Every time SketchUp can make a face, it will. There’s no such thing as 
a “Face tool” in this software; SketchUp just automatically makes a face 
every time you finish drawing a closed shape out of three or more copla-
nar edges. Figure 2-6 shows this in action: As soon as I connect the last 
edge that I draw to the first one to close the loop, SketchUp creates a 
face.
 
Figure 2-6: 
SketchUp 
automati-
cally makes 
a face 
whenever 
you create a 
closed loop 
of coplanar 
edges.
 
 
✓ You can’t stop SketchUp from creating faces, but you can erase them 
if you want. If a face you don’t want ends up getting created, just right-
click it and choose Erase from the context menu. That face will be 
deleted, but the edges that defined it will remain. (See Figure 2-7.)
 
✓ If you delete one of the edges that defines a face, that face will be 
deleted, too. When I erase one of the edges in the cube (with the Eraser 
tool, in this case), both of the faces that were defined by that edge disap-
pear. This happens because it’s impossible to have a face without also 
having all its edges.

28
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
Figure 2-7: 
You can 
delete a 
face without 
deleting the 
edges that 
define it.
 
 
✓ Retracing an edge re-creates a missing face. If you already have a closed 
loop of coplanar edges, but no face (because you erased it, perhaps), 
you can redraw one of the edges to make a new face. Just use the Line 
tool to trace over one of the edge segments, and a face will reappear. 
(See Figure 2-8.)
 
Figure 2-8: 
Just retrace 
any edge 
on a closed 
loop to tell 
SketchUp 
to create a 
new face.
 
Drawing an edge from here...
...to here...
...causes this face to be created
 
✓ Drawing an edge all the way across a face splits the face in two. When 
you draw an edge (like with the Line tool) from one side of a face to 
another, you cut that face in two. The same thing happens when you 
draw a closed loop of edges (like a rectangle) on a face — you end up 
with two faces, one “inside” the other. In Figure 2-9, I split a face in two 
with the Line tool, and then I extrude one of them out a little bit with the 
Push/Pull tool.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Splitting a 
face with 
an edge, 
and then 
extruding 
one of the 
new faces.
 

29
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
✓ Drawing an edge that crosses another edge automatically splits both 
edges where they cross. This is new for SketchUp 7. In previous ver-
sions, edges didn’t split each other; you had to do it manually with the 
Line tool.
Drawing in 3D on a 2D Screen
For computer programmers, letting you draw three-dimensional objects on 
your screen is a difficult problem. You wouldn’t think it would be such a big 
deal; after all, people have been drawing in perspective for a very long time. If 
some old guy could figure it out 500 years ago, why should it give your com-
puter any problems?
The thing is, human perception of depth on paper is a trick of the eye. 
And of course, your computer doesn’t have eyes that enable it to interpret 
depth without thinking about it. You need to give it explicit instructions. In 
SketchUp, this means using drawing axes and inferences, as I explain in the 
sections that follow.
Don’t worry about drawing in perspective
Contrary to popular belief, modeling in SketchUp 
doesn’t involve drawing in perspective and 
letting the software figure out what you mean. 
There are two reasons for which this turns out 
to be a very good thing:
 ✓ Computers aren’t very good at figuring
out what you’re trying to do. This has 
probably happened to you: You’re working 
away at your computer, and the software 
you’re using tries to “help” by guessing 
what you’re doing. Sometimes it works, but 
most of the time it doesn’t, and eventually, 
it gets really annoying. Even if SketchUp 
were able to interpret your perspective 
drawings, you’d probably spend more time 
correcting its mistakes than actually building 
something.
 ✓ Most people can’t draw in perspective 
anyway. I can see you nodding, because 
even if you’re one of the few folks who 
can, you know darn well that most people 
couldn’t draw an accurate 3D view of the 
inside of a room if their life depended on 
it — drawing just isn’t one of the things 
we’re taught, unfortunately. So even if 
SketchUp did work by turning your 2D 
perspective drawings into 3D models (which 
it most certainly doesn’t), the vast majority
of those who “can’t draw” wouldn’t be 
able to use it. And that would be a shame, 
because building 3D models is a real kick.

30
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Giving instructions with the drawing axes
 
Color Plate 1 is a shot of the SketchUp modeling window, right after you create 
a new file. See the three colored lines that cross in the lower-left corner of the 
screen? These are the drawing axes, and they’re the key to understanding how 
SketchUp works. Simply put, you use SketchUp’s drawing axes to figure out 
where you are (and where you want to go) in 3D space. When you’re working 
with the color axes, you need to keep three important things in mind:
 
✓ The red, green, and blue drawing axes define three-dimensional 
space in your model. If you were standing at the spot where all three 
axes meet (the axis origin), the blue axis would run vertically, passing 
through your head and feet. The red and green axes define the ground 
plane in SketchUp; you’d be standing on top of them. The axes are all at 
right angles to one another, and extend to infinity from the origin.
 
✓ When you draw, move, or copy something parallel to one of the 
colored axes, you’re working in that color’s direction. Take a look at 
Color Plate 2. In the first image, I’m drawing a line parallel to the red 
axis, so I would say I’m drawing “in the red direction.” I’m sure that the 
line I’m drawing is parallel to the red axis because it turns red to let me 
know. In the second image, I’m moving a box parallel to the blue axis, 
so I’m “moving in the blue direction.” I know I’m parallel to the blue axis 
because a dotted, blue line appears to tell me so.
 
✓ The whole point of using the red, green, and blue axes is to let 
SketchUp know what you mean. Remember that the big problem 
with modeling in 3D on a computer is the fact that you’re working on 
a 2D screen. Consider the example shown in Color Plate 3: If I click the 
cylinder with the Move tool and move my cursor up, how is SketchUp 
supposed to know whether I mean to move it up in space (above the 
ground) or back in space? That’s where the colored axes come into play: 
If I want to move it up, I go in the blue direction. If I want to move it back, 
I follow the green direction (because the green axis happens to run from 
the front to the back of my screen).
 
 When you’re working in SketchUp, you use the colored drawing axes all 
the time. They’re not just handy; they’re what makes SketchUp work. 
Having colored axes (instead of ones labeled x, y, and z) lets you draw 
in 3D space without having to type in commands to tell your computer 
where you want to draw. They make modeling in SketchUp quick, accu-
rate, and relatively intuitive. All you have to do is make sure that you’re 
working in your intended color direction as you model by lining up your 
objects with the axes and watching the screen tips that tell you what 
direction you’re working in. After your first couple of hours with the 
software, paying attention to the colors becomes second nature — I 
promise.

31
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
Keeping an eye out for inferences
 
If you’ve spent any time fiddling with SketchUp, you’ve noticed all the little 
colored circles, squares, dotted lines, yellow tags, and other doodads that 
show up as you move your cursor around your modeling window. All this stuff 
is referred to collectively as SketchUp’s inference engine, and its sole purpose 
is to help you while you’re building models. Luckily, it does. Without inferences 
(the aforementioned doodads), SketchUp wouldn’t be very useful.
Point inferences
Generally, SketchUp’s inferences help you be more precise. Point inferences 
(see Color Plate 2-4) appear when you move your cursor over specific parts 
of your model. They look like little colored circles and squares, and if you 
pause for a second, they’re accompanied by a yellow tag that says what they 
are. For example, watching for the little green Endpoint inference (which 
appears whenever your cursor is over one of the ends of an edge) helps you 
accurately connect an edge you’re drawing to the end of another edge in your 
model. Here’s a list of them (I don’t give descriptions because I think they’re 
pretty self-explanatory):
 
✓ Endpoint (green)
 
✓ Midpoint (cyan or light blue)
 
✓ Intersection (red X)
 
✓ On Edge (red)
 
✓ Center (of a circle, green)
 
✓ On Face (dark blue)
 
In SketchUp, lines are called edges, and surfaces are called faces. Everything in 
your model is made up of edges and faces.
Linear inferences
As you’ve probably already noticed, color plays a big part in SketchUp’s user 
interface (the way it looks). Maybe the best example of this is in the soft-
ware’s linear inferences — the “helper lines” that show up to help you work 
more precisely. Color Plate 2-5 is an illustration of all of them in action, and 
here’s a description of what they do:
 
✓ On Axis: When an edge you’re drawing is parallel to one of the colored 
drawing axes, the edge turns the color of that axis.
 
✓ From Point: This one’s a little harder to describe. When you’re moving 
your cursor, sometimes you’ll see a colored, dotted line appear. This 

32
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
means that you’re “lined up” with the point at the end of the dotted line. 
Naturally, the color of the From Point inference corresponds to which-
ever axis you’re lined up “on.” Sometimes From Point inferences show 
up on their own, and sometimes you have to encourage them; see the 
section “Encouraging inferences,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
✓ Perpendicular: When you’re drawing an edge that’s perpendicular to 
another edge, the one you’re drawing turns magenta (reddish purple).
 
✓ Parallel: When it’s parallel to another edge in your model, the edge 
you’re drawing turns magenta to let you know. You tell SketchUp which 
edge you’re interested in “being parallel to” by encouraging an inference.
 
✓ Tangent at Vertex: This one only applies when you’re drawing an arc 
(using the Arc tool) that starts at the endpoint of another arc. When the 
arc you’re drawing is tangent to the other one, the one you’re drawing 
turns cyan. Tangent, in this case, means that the transition between the 
two arcs is smooth.
 
One of the most important inferences in SketchUp is one that you probably 
didn’t even realize was an inference. It’s the fact that, unless you specifically 
start on an edge or a face in your model, you’ll always be drawing on the 
ground plane by default. That’s right — if you just start creating stuff in the 
middle of nowhere, SketchUp just assumes that you mean to be drawing on 
the ground.
Using inferences to help you model
 
A big part of using SketchUp’s inference engine involves locking and encourag-
ing inferences — sometimes even simultaneously. At first, it’ll seem a little like 
that thing where you pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time, 
but with practice, it gets easier.
Locking inferences
If you hold down Shift when you see any of the first four types of linear infer-
ences described previously, that inference gets locked — and stays locked 
until you release Shift. When you lock an inference, you constrain whatever 
tool you’re using to only work in the direction of the inference you locked. 
Confused? Check out the following example for some clarity.
Color Plate 6 shows a situation where it would be useful to lock a blue On 
Axis inference while I’m using the Line tool. I want to draw a vertical line 
that’s exactly as tall as the peak of the house’s roof, so here’s what I do:
 
1. Click once to start drawing an edge.

33
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
2. Move my cursor up until I see the edge I’m drawing turn blue.
 
 This is the blue On Axis inference that lets me know I’m exactly parallel 
to the blue drawing axis.
 
3. Hold down Shift to lock the inference I see.
 
 My edge gets thicker to let me know it’s locked, and now I can only draw 
in the blue direction (no matter where I move my cursor).
 
4. Click the peak of the roof to make my vertical edge end at exactly that 
height.
 
5. Release Shift to unlock the inference.
Encouraging inferences
Sometimes, an inference you need doesn’t show up on its own — when this 
happens, you have to encourage it. To encourage an inference, just hover 
your cursor over the part of your model you’d like to “infer” from, and then 
slowly go back to whatever you were doing when you decided you could use 
an inference. The following example demonstrates how to encourage an 
inference.
Color Plate 7 shows a model of a cylinder. I’d like to start drawing an edge 
that lines up perfectly with the center of the circle on top of the cylinder, but 
I don’t want it to start at the center itself. Follow these steps:
 
1. Hover (don’t click) over the edge of the circle for about two seconds.
 
2. Move slowly toward the middle of the circle until the Center Point 
inference appears.
 
3. Hover (still don’t click) over the center point for a couple of seconds.
 
4. Move your cursor slowly in the direction of where you want to start 
drawing your edge.
 
 A dotted From Point inference should appear.
 
5. Click to start drawing your edge.
Warming Up Your SketchUp Muscles
I can think of seven activities you’ll need to do every time you use SketchUp. 
Formal-education types would probably call them “core competencies,” but I 
find language like that tends to put people to sleep. Whatever you care to call 
these activities, I’ll introduce them all at the same time, in the following sec-
tions, so you can come back and get a quick refresher whenever you want.

34
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Getting the best view of what you’re doing
 
Using SketchUp without learning how to orbit, zoom, and pan is like trying to 
build a ship in a bottle. In the dark. With your hands tied behind your back. 
Using chopsticks. Get the picture?
Fully half of modeling in SketchUp uses the aforementioned navigation tools, 
which let you change your view so that you can see what you’re doing. Most 
people who try to figure out SketchUp on their own take too long to under-
stand this; they spend hours squinting, grunting, and having an all-around 
miserable time trying to “get at” what they’re working on. The following sec-
tions help you avoid the headache (literally).
 
SketchUp has three tools that are dedicated to letting you get a better view of 
your model. I usually call them the Big Three, but I’m a little afraid of lawsuits 
from big companies in Detroit, so I’ll just refer to them collectively as the navi-
gation tools.
Going into orbit
Hold a glass of water in your hand. Now twist and turn your wrist around in 
every direction so that the water’s all over you and the rest of the room. Stop 
when the glass is completely empty. I think that’s a pretty memorable way to 
find out about the Orbit tool, don’t you?
Just as your wrist helps you twist and turn a glass to see it from every angle, 
think of using Orbit as the way to fly around your work. Figure 2-10 shows 
Orbit in all its glory.
Here’s some stuff you should know about using Orbit:
 
✓ It’s on the Camera menu. By far the least productive way to use Orbit is 
to choose it from the Camera menu.
 
✓ It’s also on the toolbar. The second-least productive way to activate 
Orbit is to click its button on the toolbar. It looks like two blue arrows

✓ You can orbit using your mouse. Here’s how you should always orbit: 
Click the scroll wheel of your mouse and hold it down. Now move your 
mouse around. See your model swiveling around? Release the scroll 
wheel when you’re done. Using your mouse to orbit means that you 
don’t have to switch tools every time you want a better view, which 
saves you truckloads of time.

Zooming in and out
Hold your empty glass at arm’s length. Close your eyes, and then bring the 
glass rushing toward you, stopping right when it smashes you in the nose. 
Now throw the glass across the room, noticing how it shrinks as it gets far-
ther away. That, in a nutshell, describes the Zoom tool.
You use Zoom to get closer to (and farther from) your model. If you’re work-
ing on something small, you zoom in until it fills your modeling window. To 
see everything at once, zoom out. Figure 2-11 is a demonstration. I can think 
of a couple things to tell you about Zoom:

✓ Just like Orbit, you can activate the Zoom tool in several ways. The 
worst way is from the Camera menu; the next-worst way is to click the 
Zoom tool button in the toolbar. If you use Zoom either of these two 
ways, you actually zoom in and out by clicking and dragging up and 
down on your screen.
 
 The best way to zoom is to roll your finger on the scroll wheel of your 
mouse to zoom in and out. Instead of clicking the scroll wheel to orbit, 
just roll your scroll wheel back and forth to zoom. And just like Orbit, 
using your mouse to zoom means that you don’t have to switch tools — as 
soon as you stop zooming, you revert to whatever tool you were using 
before.
 
✓ Use Zoom Extents to see everything. Technically, Zoom Extents is a 
separate tool altogether, but I think it’s related enough to mention here. 
If you want your model to fill your modeling window (which is especially 
useful when you “get lost” with the navigation tools — trust me, it 
happens to everyone), just choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
 
When you use the Zoom tool, SketchUp zooms in on your cursor; just position it 
over whatever part of your model you want to zoom in on (or zoom out from). 
If your cursor isn’t over any of your model’s geometry (faces and edges), the 
Zoom tool won’t work very well — you’ll end up zooming either really slowly 
or really quickly.
Just panning around
Using the Pan tool is a lot like washing windows — you move the paper towel 
back and forth, but it stays flat and it never gets any closer or farther away 
from you. The Pan tool is basically for sliding your model view around in 
your modeling window. To see something that’s to the right, you use Pan to 
slide your model to the left. It’s as simple as that. You should know these 
three things about Pan:
 
✓ Pan is on the Camera menu. But that’s not where you should go to 
activate it.
 
✓ Pan is also on the toolbar. You could access the Pan tool by clicking its 
button on the toolbar (it looks like a severed hand), but there’s a better 
way. . . . 
 
✓ Hold down your mouse’s scroll wheel button and press Shift. When 
you do both at the same time — basically, Orbit+Shift — your cursor 
temporarily turns into the Pan tool. When it does so, move your mouse 
to pan.

 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
Drawing edges with ease
 
Being able to use the Line tool without having to think too much about it is the 
secret to being able to model anything you want in SketchUp. You use the Line 
tool to draw individual edges, and because SketchUp models are really just 
fancy collections of edges (carefully arranged, I’ll admit), anything you can 
make in SketchUp, you can make with the Line tool.
 
SketchUp models are made up of edges and faces. Anytime you have three or 
more edges that are connected and on the same plane, SketchUp creates a face. 
If you erase one of the edges that “defines” a face (borders it), the face disap-
pears, too. Take a look at the section “It’s All about Edges and Faces,” earlier 
in this chapter, for more information on the relationship between edges and 
faces.
Drawing edges is simple. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Line tool (some people call it the Pencil tool).
 
2. Click where you want your line to begin.
 
3. Move your cursor to the desired endpoint for your line, and click 
again to end.
 
 Figure 2-12 demonstrates the basic idea.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Use the Line 
tool to draw 
edges.
 
 
 When you draw a line segment with the Line tool, notice how SketchUp 
automatically tries to draw another line? This is called rubber banding — 
the Line tool lets you “continue” to draw edge segments, automatically 
starting each new one at the end of the previous one you drew.
 
4. When you want the Line tool to stop drawing lines, press Esc to snip 
the line at the last spot you clicked.

38
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
SketchUp lets you draw lines in two ways: You can either use the click-drag-
release method or the click-move-click one. They both work, of course, but 
I highly recommend training yourself to do the latter. You’ll have more con-
trol, and your hand won’t get as tired. When you draw edges by clicking and 
dragging your mouse (click-drag-release), you’re a lot more likely to “drop” 
your line accidentally. Because the Line tool only draws straight lines, think 
about using it less like a pencil (even though it looks like one) and more like a 
spool of sticky thread.
 
The Eraser tool is specifically designed for erasing edges; use it by clicking 
the edges you don’t like to delete them. You can also drag over edges with the 
Eraser, but I think that’s a little harder to get used to.
Injecting accuracy into your model
 
It’s all well and fine to make a model, but most of the time, you need to make 
sure that it’s accurate. Without a certain level of accuracy, it’s not as useful for 
figuring things out. The key to accuracy in SketchUp is the little text box that 
lives in the lower-right corner of your SketchUp window — the one I point out 
in Figure 2-13.
It’s called the Measurements box, and here are some of the things you can do 
with it:
 
✓ Make a line a certain length
 
✓ Draw a rectangle a certain size
 
✓ Push/pull a face a certain distance
 
✓ Change the number of sides in a polygon
 
✓ Move something a given distance
Turning off “rubber-banding” lines
Depending on what you’re making, and on how 
you work, you might want to turn the Line tool’s 
rubber-banding behavior off. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 1. Choose Window➪Preferences (SketchUp➪
Preferences on the Mac).
 2. Choose the Drawing panel from the list on 
the left in the Preferences dialog box.
 3. Deselect the Continue Line Drawing check 
box.

 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
Figure 2-13: 
SketchUp’s

ments box 
is the key 
to working 
precisely.
 
Value Control box
 
✓ Rotate something by a certain number of degrees
 
✓ Make a certain number of copies
 
✓ Divide a line into a certain number of segments
 
✓ Change your field of view (how much you can see)
Here are some things you should know about the Measurements box:
 
✓ You don’t have to click in the Measurements box to enter a number. 
This one’s a big one: When they’re first starting out with SketchUp, 
people assume that they need to click in the Measurements box (to 
select it, presumably) before they can start typing. They (and you) 
don’t — just start typing, and whatever you type shows up in the box 
automatically. When it comes to being precise, SketchUp is always “lis-
tening” for you to type something in this box.
 
✓ The Measurements box is context-sensitive. This means that what it 
controls depends on what you happen to be doing at the time. If you’re 
drawing an edge with the Line tool, it knows that whatever you type is a 
length; if you’re rotating something, it knows to listen for an angle.

40
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ You the set the default units for the Measurements box in the Model 
Info dialog box. Perhaps you want a line you’re drawing to be 14 inches 
long. If you’re set up to use inches as your default unit of measurement, 
just type 14 into the Measurements box and press Enter — SketchUp 
assumes that you mean 14 inches. If you want to draw something 14 feet 
long, you would type in 14', just to let SketchUp know that you mean feet 
instead of inches. You can override the default unit of measurement by 
typing in any unit you want. If you want to move something a distance 
of 25 meters, type in 25m and press Enter. You set the default units for 
the Measurements box in the Units panel of the Model Info dialog box 
(which is on the Window menu).
 
✓ Sometimes, the Measurements box does more than one thing. In 
certain circumstances, you can change its mode (what it’s “listening 
for”) by typing in a unit type after a number. For example, when you’re 
drawing a circle, the default “value” in the Measurements box is the 
radius — if you type 6 and press Enter, you’ll end up with a circle with a 
radius of 6 inches. But if you type in 6s, you’re telling SketchUp that you 
want 6 sides (and not inches), so you’ll end up with a circle with 6 sides. 
If you type in 6 and press Enter, and then type in 6s and press Enter 
again, SketchUp will draw a hexagon (a 6-sided circle) with a radius of 6 
inches.
 
✓ The Measurements box lets you change your mind. As long as you 
don’t do anything after you press Enter, you can always type a new 
value and press Enter again; there’s no limit to the number of times you 
can change your mind.
 
✓ You can use the Measurements box during an operation. In most 
cases, you can use the Measurements box to be precise while you’re 
using a tool. Here’s how that works:
 
1. Click once to start your operation (such as drawing a line or using 
the Move tool).
 
2. Move your mouse so that you’re “going in the correct color direc-
tion.” If you’re using the Line tool and you want to draw parallel to 
the green axis, make sure that the edge you’re drawing is green. Be 
sure not to click again.
 
3. Without clicking the Measurements box, just type in the dimension 
you want; you should see it appear in the box.
 
4. Press Enter to complete the operation.
 
✓ You can also use the Measurements box after an operation. Doing this 
revises what you’ve just done. These steps should give you an idea of 
what I’m talking about:
 
1. Complete your operation. This might be drawing a line, moving 
something, rotating something, or any of the other things I men-
tioned at the beginning of this section.

41
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
2. Before you do anything else, type in whatever dimension you 
intended, and then press Enter. Whatever you did should be 
redone according to what you typed in.
To give you a more concrete example, say I want to move my box (shown in 
Figure 2-14) a total of 5 meters in the red direction (parallel to the red axis). 
Here’s what I’d do:
 
1. Using the Move tool, I click the box once to pick it up.
 
2. I move my mouse until I see the linear inference that tells me I’m moving 
in the red direction.
 
3. I type in 5m, and then I press Enter. My box is positioned exactly 5 
meters from where I picked it up.
 
4. On second thought, I don’t think I’m happy with the 5 meters, so I decide 
to change it. I type in 15m, and then press Enter again; the box moves 
another 10 meters in the blue direction. I can keep doing this until I’m 
happy (or bored).

the box 5

and then 
I change

Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Resizing everything with the Tape Measure tool
Consider that you’ve been working away in 
SketchUp, not paying particular attention to how 
big anything in your model is, when you sud-
denly decide that you need what you’ve made to 
be a specific size. SketchUp has a terrific trick 
for taking care of this exact situation: You can 
use the Tape Measure tool to resize your whole 
model based on a single measurement.
Here’s how it works: In the following figure, 
I’ve started to model a simple staircase, and 
now I want to make sure that it’s the right size; 
doing so will make it easier to keep working on 
it. I know I want the riser height (the vertical 
distance between the steps) to be 7 inches, so 
this is what I do:
 1. Select the Tape Measure tool (choose 
Tools➪Tape Measure).
 2. Make sure that the Tape Measure is in 
Measure mode by pressing Ctrl (Option on 
the Mac) until you don’t see a plus sign (+) 
next to the Tape Measure cursor.
 3. To measure the distance I want to change 
(in this case, the riser height), I click once 
to start measuring and click again to stop.
 4. I type in the dimension I want what I just 
measured to be: 7 (for 7 inches).
 5. In the dialog box that appears, asking me 
whether I want to resize my whole model, 
I click the Yes button.
When I click the Yes button, my whole model 
is resized proportionately to the dimension I 
entered.

 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
Selecting What You Mean to Select
 
If you want to move something in your model, or rotate it, or copy it, or do any 
number of other things to it, you need to select it first. When you select ele-
ments, you’re telling SketchUp that this is the stuff you want to work with. To 
select things, you use (drum roll, please) the Select tool, which looks exactly 
the same as the Select tool in every other graphics program on the planet — 
it’s an arrow. That’s a good thing, because selecting isn’t the sort of thing you 
should have to relearn every time you pick up a new program. Here’s every-
thing you need to know about selecting things in SketchUp:
 
✓ Just click anything in your model to select it (while you’re using the 
Select tool, of course).
 
✓ To select more than one thing, hold down Shift while you click all the 
things you want to select. (See Figure 2-15.)
 
 Shift works both ways when it comes to the Select tool. You can use it 
to add to your set of selected objects (which I mention above), but you 
can also use it to subtract an object from your selection. In other words, 
if you have a bunch of stuff selected, and you want to deselect some-
thing in particular, just hold down Shift while you click it — it won’t be 
selected anymore.
 
✓ Selected objects in SketchUp look different depending on what kind of 
objects they are:
 
• Selected edges and guides turn blue.
 
• Selected faces look covered in tiny blue dots.
 
• Selected groups and components (which you can read about in 
Chapter 5) get a blue box around them.
 
• Selected section planes (see Chapter 10 for more info on these) 
turn blue.
 
Figure 2-15: 
Click things 
with the 
Select tool 
to select 
them. Hold 
down Shift 
to select 
more than 
one thing.
 

44
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ A much fancier way to select things in your model is to double- and 
triple-click them. When you double-click a face, you select that face and 
all the edges that define it. Double-clicking an edge gives you that edge 
plus all the faces that are connected to it. When you triple-click an edge 
or a face, you select the whole object that it’s a part of. Figure 2-16 
shows what I mean.
 
Figure 2-16: 
Try single-, 
double-, and 
triple-
clicking 
edges and 
faces in 
your model 
to make 
different 
kinds of 
selections.
 
Single click selects a face
Double-click selects the 
face and edges
Triple-click selects the
whole object
 
✓ You can also select several things at once by dragging a box around 
them. You have two kinds of selection boxes; which one you use 
depends on what you’re trying to select (see Figure 2-17):
 
• Window selection: If you click and drag from left to right to make 
a selection box, you create a window selection. In this case, only 
things that are entirely inside your selection box are selected.
 
• Crossing selection: If you click and drag from right to left to make a 
selection box, you create a crossing selection. With one of these, 
anything your selection box touches (including what’s inside) ends 
up getting selected.
 
I keep saying that selected stuff turns blue in SketchUp, but you can make it turn 
any color you want. Blue is just the default color for new documents you create. 
The “selected things” color is one of the settings you can adjust in the Styles 
dialog box; if you’re interested, you can read all about styles in Chapter 9.
 
Just because you can’t see something doesn’t mean it isn’t selected. Whenever 
you make a selection, it’s a very good idea to orbit around to make sure 
you’ve got only what you intended to get. Accidentally selecting too much is 
an easy mistake to make.

Moving and copying like a champ
 
To move things around in SketchUp, you use the Move tool. To make a copy of 
something, you use the Move tool in combination with a button on your key-
board: Ctrl in Windows and Option on a Mac. It’s really that simple.
Moving things around
The Move tool is the one that looks like crossed red arrows. Using it involves 
clicking the entity you want to move, moving it to where you want it to be, and 
clicking again to drop it. It’s not a complicated maneuver, but getting the hang 
of it takes a little bit of time. Here are some tips for using Move successfully:
 
✓ Click, move, and click. Don’t drag your mouse. Just like using the Line 
tool, try to avoid the temptation to use the Move tool by clicking and 
dragging around with your mouse; doing so makes things a lot harder. 
Instead, practice clicking once to pick things up, moving your mouse 
without any buttons held down, and clicking again to put down what-
ever you’re moving.

46
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ Click a point that will let you position it exactly where you want when 
you drop it (instead of just clicking anywhere on the thing you’re 
trying to move to pick it up). Figure 2-18 shows two boxes that I want 
precisely to stack on top of each other. If I just click anywhere on the 
first box and move it over the other one, I can’t place it where I want; 
SketchUp just doesn’t work that way.
 
 To stack the boxes precisely, I have to click the bottom corner of the 
soon-to-be top box to grab it there, and then move my cursor over the top 
corner of the bottom box to drop it. Now my boxes are lined up perfectly.
 
Figure 2-18:

choose 
precise 
points to 
grab things 
and put 
them down.
 
...doesn’t let you stack properly
Picking it up here...
...lets you stack precisely
Picking it up here...
 
✓ Press Esc to cancel a move operation. Here’s something beginners do 
all the time: They start to move something (or start moving something 
accidentally), and then they change their minds. Instead of pressing Esc, 
they try to use Move to put things back the way they were. Inevitably, 
they don’t, and things end up getting messed up.
 
 If you change your mind in the middle of moving something, just press 
Esc; everything will go back to the way it was.

47
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
✓ Don’t forget about inferences. To move something in one of the colored 
directions, just wait until you see the dotted On Axis linear inference 
appear; then hold down Shift to lock yourself in that direction. For more 
information about using SketchUp’s inference engine, check out the sec-
tion “Keeping an eye out for inferences,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Don’t forget about the Measurements box. You can move things precise 
distances using the Measurements box; have a look at the section “Injecting 
accuracy into your model,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how.
Modeling with the Move tool
In SketchUp, the Move tool is very important for modeling; it’s not just for 
moving whole objects around. You can also use it to move just about any-
thing, including vertices (edges’ endpoints), edges, faces, and combinations of 
any of these. By only moving certain entities (all the things I just mentioned), 
you can change the shape of your geometry pretty drastically. Figure 2-19 
shows what I mean.
 
Figure 2-19: 
You can use 
the Move 
tool on 
vertices, 
edges, 
and faces 
to model 
different 
forms.
 
Moving a vertex

48
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
Using the Move tool to create forms (instead of just moving them around) is 
an incredibly powerful way to work, but isn’t particularly intuitive. After all, 
nothing in the physical world behaves like the Move tool — you can’t just grab 
the edge of a hardwood floor and move it up to turn it into a ramp in real life. 
In SketchUp, you can — and should.
Telling SketchUp who’s boss with Auto-Fold
This will happen to you sooner or later: You’ll 
be trying to move a vertex, an edge, or a face, 
and you won’t be able to go in the direction you 
want. SketchUp doesn’t like to let you create 
folds (when extra faces and edges are created 
in place of a single face) with the Move tool, so 
it constrains your movement to directions that 
won’t end up adding them. If SketchUp won’t 
let you move whatever you’re trying to move, 
force it by doing one very important thing: 
Press and hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) while 
you’re moving. When you do this, you’re telling 
SketchUp that it’s okay to proceed — to create 
folds if it has to. This is called Auto-Fold, and the 
following figure shows how it works.
Click once with the Move tool

 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
To preselect or not to preselect
The Move tool works in two different ways; you’ll eventually need to use both 
of them, depending on what you’re trying to move:
 
✓ Moving a selection: When you have a selection of one or more entities, 
the Move tool only moves the things you’ve selected. This comes in 
handy every time you need to move more than one object; Figure 2-20 
shows a selection being moved with the Move tool.
 
Figure 2-20: 
Using the 
Move tool 
when you 
have a 
selection 
only moves 
the things 
in that 
selection.
 
This isn’t selected
...so it doesn’t move with the rest
 
✓ Moving without a selection: If you don’t have anything selected, you 
can click anything in your model with the Move tool to move it around. 
Only the thing you click is moved. Figure 2-21 shows what I’m talking 
about.
Making copies with the Move tool
Lots of folks spend time hunting around in SketchUp, trying to figure out how 
to make copies. It’s very simple: You just press a modifier key (a button on 
your keyboard that tells SketchUp to do something different) while you’re 
using the Move tool. Instead of moving something, you move a copy of it. 
Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Press Ctrl to copy in Windows, and press Option to copy on a Mac. 
This tells SketchUp to switch from Move to Copy while you’re moving 
something with the Move tool. Your cursor shows a little + next to it, 
and your copy moves when you move your mouse. Figure 2-22 shows 
this in action.
 
 If you decide you don’t want to make a copy, just press Ctrl (Option) 
again to toggle back to Move; the + sign will disappear.
 
✓ Copying is just like moving, except you’re moving a copy. This means 
that all the same rules that apply to using the Move tool apply to making 
copies, too.

✓ You can make more than one copy at a time. Perhaps I wanted to make 
five equally spaced copies of a column, as shown in Figure 2-23. All I have 
to do is move a copy to where I want my last column to be; then I type 
in 5/ and press Enter. This makes five copies of my column and spaces 
them evenly between the first and last column in the row. Neat, huh?
 
 If I know how far apart I want my copies to be, I can move a copy that 
distance, type in 5x, and press Enter. My five copies appear equally 
spaced in a row. (See Figure 2-24.)

Making and using guides
 
Sometimes you need to draw temporary lines while you’re modeling. These 
temporary lines, called guides, are useful for lining things up, making things 
the right size, and generally adding precision and accuracy to what you’re 
building.
In previous versions of SketchUp, guides were called construction geometry, 
because that’s basically what they are: a special kind of entity that you create 
when and where you need them. They aren’t part of your model, because 
they’re not edges or faces. This means that you can choose to hide them or 
delete them — they don’t affect the rest of your geometry.
Figure 2-25 shows an example of guides in action. I use guides positioned 12 
inches from the wall and 36 inches apart to draw the sides of a doorway. I 
use another guide 6 feet, 8 inches from the floor to indicate the top, and then 
I draw a rectangle, bounded by my guides, which I know is exactly the right 
size. When I’m done, I erase my guides with the Eraser tool, as I explain in a 
moment.
 
Figure 2-25: 
Use guides 
to measure 
things

draw.
 
Creating guides with the Tape Measure tool
You can create three different kinds of guides, and you use the Tape Measure 
tool to make all of them. (See Figure 2-26.)

✓ Parallel guide lines: Clicking anywhere (except the endpoints or mid-
point) along an edge with the Tape Measure tells SketchUp that you 
want to create a guide parallel to that edge. (See Figure 2-26.) Just move 
your mouse and you’ll see a parallel, dashed line; click again to place it 
wherever you want.
 
✓ Linear guide lines: To create a guide along an edge in your model, click 
one of the endpoints or the midpoint once, and then click again some-
where else along the edge.
 
✓ Guide points: You might want to place a point somewhere in space; you 
can do exactly that with guide points. With the Tape Measure tool, click 
an edge’s midpoint or endpoint, and then click again somewhere else in 
space. A little x appears at the end of a dashed line — that’s your new 
guide point.

54
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
Here’s an important point about the Tape Measure tool: It has two modes, and 
it only creates guides in one of them. Pressing Ctrl (Option on a Mac) toggles 
between the modes. When you see a + next to your cursor, your Tape Measure 
can make guides; when there’s no +, it can’t.
Using guides to make your life easier
As you’re working along in this software, you’ll find yourself using guides 
all the time; they’re an indispensable part of the way modeling in SketchUp 
works. Here are some things you should know about using them:
 
✓ Position guides precisely using the Measurements box. Check out the 
section “Injecting accuracy into your model,” earlier in this chapter, to 
find out how.
 
✓ Erase guides one at a time. Just click or drag over them with the Eraser 
tool to delete guides individually. You can also right-click them and 
choose Erase from the context menu.
 
✓ Erase all your guides at once. Choosing Edit➪Delete Guides does just 
that.
 
✓ Hide guides individually or all at once. Right-click a single guide and 
choose Hide to hide it, or deselect View➪Guides to hide all of them. It’s 
a good idea to hide your guides instead of erasing them, especially while 
you’re still modeling.
 
✓ Select, move, copy, and rotate guides just like any other entity in your 
model. Guides aren’t edges, but you can treat them that way a lot of the 
time.
Painting your faces with color and texture
When it comes to adding colors and textures — collectively referred to in 
SketchUp as materials — to your model, there’s really only one place you 
need to look, and one tool you need to use — the Materials dialog box and 
the Paint Bucket tool, respectively.
The Materials dialog box
To open the Materials dialog box (or Colors dialog box on the Mac), choose 
Window➪Materials. Figure 2-27 shows what you see when you do. The 
Materials dialog box is radically different in the Windows and Mac versions of 
SketchUp, but that’s okay — they basically do the same thing.

55
 Chapter 2: Establishing the Modeling Mind-Set
 
Figure 2-27: 
The 
Materials 
dialog box 
in Windows 
(left) and on 
the Mac.
 
In SketchUp, you can choose from two different kinds of materials to apply to 
the faces in your model:
 
✓ Colors: These are simple — colors are always solid colors. You can’t 
have gradients (where one color fades into another), but you can pretty 
much make any color you want.
 
✓ Textures: Basically, a SketchUp texture is a tiny image — a photograph, 
really — that gets tiled over and over to cover the face you apply it to. 
If you paint a face with, say, a brick texture, what you’re really doing is 
telling SketchUp to cover the surface with however many “brick photo” 
tiles it takes to do the job. The preview image you see in the Materials 
dialog box is actually a picture of a single texture image tile.
 
 SketchUp comes with a whole bunch of textures, and you can always go 
online and choose from thousands more available for sale. And if that’s 
still not enough, you can make your own (though the process is well 
beyond the scope of this humble tome).
 
On the Mac, you have to click the little brick icon in the Materials dialog box 
to see the textures libraries that ship with SketchUp; it’s the drop-down list 
next to the little house icon.
Here’s some more interesting information about SketchUp materials:
 
✓ Materials can be translucent. Sliding the Opacity slider makes the 
material you’ve selected more or less translucent, which makes seeing 
through windows in your model a lot easier.

56
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
✓ Textures can have transparent areas. If you take a look at the materi-
als in the Fencing library, you’ll notice that a lot of them look kind of 
strange; they have areas of black that don’t seem right. These black 
areas are areas of transparency — when you paint a face with one of 
these textures, you’ll be able to see through the areas that look black.
 
✓ You can edit materials, and even make your own. I’d consider this to 
be a pretty advanced use of SketchUp, so I’m not going to talk about it in 
this book, but I thought you should at least know it’s possible.
The Paint Bucket tool
The Paint Bucket tool looks just like — you guessed it — a bucket of paint. 
Activating it automatically opens the Materials dialog box, which is handy. 
Here’s everything you need to know about the Paint Bucket:
 
✓ You fill it by clicking in the Materials dialog box. Just click a material 
to load your bucket, and then click the face you want to paint. It’s as 
simple as that.
 
✓ Holding down Alt (Ô on a Mac) switches to the Sample tool. With the 
Sample tool, you can click any face in your model to load your Paint 
Bucket with that face’s material. Release the Alt key to revert to the 
Paint Bucket tool.
 
✓ Holding down Shift paints all similar faces. If you hold down Shift when 
you click to paint a face, all faces in your model that match the one you 
click will be painted, too. If things don’t turn out the way you want, just 
choose Edit➪Undo to go back a step.

▶ Building a simple model
▶ Changing the way the model looks
▶ Exporting a JPEG file that you can e-mail
I
f you can’t wait to get your hands dirty (so to speak), you’ve come to the 
right chapter. Here, I help you make a simple model step by step, spin it 
around, paint it, and even apply styles and shadows. You don’t need to read 
another word of this book to be able to follow along, although I do refer you 
to chapters where you can find out more. Above all, these pages are about 
doing and about the basics of putting together the various SketchUp features 
to produce a knockout model in no time.
So what are you going to build? Perhaps a doghouse. The nice thing about 
doghouses is that they’re a lot like peoplehouses in the ways that count: 
They have doors and roofs, and just about everybody has seen one.
 
One last thing: Just about every other piece of this book is written so that you 
can jump around to the bits you need; you don’t have to follow a particular 
order. I’m afraid this chapter is the exception to that rule. If you want to follow 
along, you should start on this page and work your way to the end. Otherwise, 
things just won’t make sense.
Setting Things Up
I know — setup is boring. Who wants to flip through menus and options 
dialog boxes instead of jumping in? I completely agree, so I’ll keep this short 
and sweet. This section is just about making sure that you’re starting at the 
right place. That’s it.

58
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
Follow these steps to get ready:
 
1. Launch Google SketchUp.
 
2. Choose your default settings.
 
 If you’ve never launched SketchUp on your computer before, you’ll see 
the Welcome to SketchUp dialog box. (See Figure 3-1.) Here’s what to do 
if it pops up:
 
Figure 3-1: 
The 
Welcome to 
SketchUp 
dialog box, 
which pops 
up the first 
time you 
launch 
SketchUp.
 
 
a. Click the Choose Template button.
 
b. Choose one of the “Architectural Design” templates — it doesn’t 
matter if you prefer Feet and Inches or Millimeters.
 
c. Click the Start using SketchUp button to close the dialog box and 
open a new SketchUp file.
 
 If the Welcome to SketchUp dialog box doesn’t appear, someone (maybe 
you) has told the dialog box not to show up automatically on startup. 
Don’t worry — just follow these steps to set things straight:
 
a. Choose Help ➪Welcome to SketchUp from the menu bar.
 
b. Do Steps a and b from the list a few sentences ago.
 
c. Open a new file by choosing File➪New.
 
 If you’re using the Pro version of SketchUp 7, the Welcome to SketchUp 
dialog box looks a little different — it includes information about your 
software license. The best place to go for help when you’re having trou-
ble with your license is the SketchUp Help Center. Choose Help➪Online 
Help Center to go there directly from SketchUp.

59
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
3. Make sure that you can see the Getting Started toolbar.
 
 Figure 3-2 shows the Getting Started toolbar. If it’s not visible in your 
modeling window, choose View➪Toolbars➪Getting Started to make it 
show up. If you’re on a Mac, choose View➪Show Toolbar.

4. Clear your modeling window.
 
 If this isn’t the first time SketchUp has been run on your computer, you 
might see dialog boxes all over the place. If that’s the case, just open the 
Window menu and make sure that everything is deselected to get rid of 
them.
Making a Quick Model
Figure 3-3 shows what your computer screen should look like at this point. 
You should see a row of tools across the top of your modeling window, a 
little man, and three colored modeling axes (red, green, and blue lines).
 
Figure 3-3: 
This is what 
your screen 
should 
look like in 
Windows 
(left) and 
on a Mac 
(right).
 
 
Follow these steps to build a doghouse (and check this book’s companion 
Web site at www.dummies.com/go/SketchUp7FD for additional help):

60
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
1. Delete the little man on your screen.
 
 Using the Select tool (the arrow on the far left of your toolbar), click the 
little man to select him (his name is Sang, in case that matters to you), 
and then choose Edit➪Delete.
 
2. Choose Camera➪Standard Views➪Iso.
 
 This switches you to an isometric (3D) view of your model, which allows 
you to build something without having to “move around.”
 
3. Draw a rectangle on the ground.
 
 Use the Rectangle tool (between the pencil and the circle on your tool-
bar) to draw a rectangle by doing the following:
 
a. Click once to place one corner on the left side of your screen.
 
b. Click again to place the opposite corner on the right side of your 
screen.
 
 Remember that you’re in a 3D, perspective, view of the world, so your 
rectangle will look more like a diamond — 90-degree angles don’t look 
like 90-degree angles in perspective. Figure 3-4 shows what you should 
be aiming for in this step.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Draw a 3D 
rectangle on 
the ground.
 
Click here to start drawing
Finish drawing here
 
 It’s important to draw the right kind of rectangle for this example (or for 
any model you’re trying to create in Perspective view), so try it a few times 
until it looks like the rectangle in Figure 3-4. To go back a step, choose 
Edit➪Undo Rectangle; the last thing you did will be undone. You can use 
Undo to go back as many steps as you like, so feel free to use it anytime.

61
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
4. Use the Push/Pull tool to extrude your rectangle into a box.
 
 Use this tool (it looks like a brown box with a red arrow coming out the 
top) to pull your rectangle into a box by following these steps:
 
a. Click the rectangle once to start the push/pull operation.
 
b. Click again, somewhere above your rectangle, to stop pushing/
pulling.
 
 At this point, you should have something that looks like Figure 3-5; if you 
don’t, use Push/Pull again to make your box look about the right height.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Use the 
Push/Pull 
tool to 
extrude your 
rectangle 
into a box.
 
 
 If you are happily pushing/pulling away on your box, and everything 
suddenly disappears, it’s because you pushed/pulled the top of your 
box all the way to the ground. Just choose Edit➪Undo and keep going.
 
5. Draw a couple of diagonal lines for your roof.
 
 Use the Line tool (it’s shaped like a pencil) to draw two diagonal edges 
(lines) that will form your peaked roof, as shown in Figure 3-6. Follow 
these steps:
 
a. Click once at the midpoint of the top of your box’s front face to 
start your line.
 
 You’ll know you’re at the midpoint when you see a small, light-blue 
dot and the word Midpoint appears. Move slowly to make sure that 
you see it.
 
b. Click again somewhere along one of the side edges of your box’s 
front face to end your line.

62
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
Figure 3-6: 
Draw two 
diagonal 
lines that 
will become 
your peaked 
roof.
 
Click here to start drawing
Click here to finish your first edge
 
 Wait until you see a red On Edge cue (just like the Midpoint one 
in the last step) before you click; if you don’t, your new line won’t 
end on the edge like it’s supposed to.
 
c. Repeat the previous two steps to draw a similar (but opposite) line 
from the midpoint to the edge on the other side of the face.
 
 Don’t worry about making your diagonal lines symmetrical; for the 
purposes of this exercise, it’s not important that they are.
 
6. Push/pull the triangles away to leave a sloped roof.
 
 Use the Push/Pull tool (the same one you used back in Step 4) to get rid 
of the triangular parts of your box, leaving you with a sloped roof. Have 
a look at Figure 3-7 to see this in action, and follow these steps:
 
Figure 3-7: 
Use the 
Push/Pull 
tool to form 
a peaked 
roof on your 
box.
 

63
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
a. Select the Push/Pull tool, then click the right triangular face once 
to start the push/pull operation.
 
b. Move your cursor to the right to push the triangle as far as it will 
go (even with the end of your box).
 
c. Click again (on the triangle) to end the push/pull operation and to 
make the triangular face disappear.
 
d. Still using the Push/Pull tool, double-click the left triangular face to 
repeat the previous push/pull operation, making that face disap-
pear as well.
 
7. Draw a rectangle on your front face.
 
 Switch back to the Rectangle tool (which you used in Step 3) and draw 
a rectangle on the front face of your pointy box. Make sure that the 
bottom of your rectangle is flush with the bottom of your box by watch-
ing for the red On Edge hint to appear before you click. Check out Figure 
3-8 to see what it should look like when you’re done.
 
Figure 3-8: 
A rectangle 
drawn on 
the front of 
your pointy 
box.
 
Finish here
Click here to start drawing
 
 Using the Rectangle tool is a two-step process: You click once to place 
one corner and again to place the opposite corner. Try not to draw lines 
and shapes in SketchUp by dragging your cursor; doing so makes things 
more difficult. Practice clicking once to start an operation (like drawing 
a rectangle) and clicking again to stop.

64
Part I: Getting Started with SketchUp 
 
8. Draw an arc on top of the rectangle you just drew.
 
 Use the Arc tool (to the right of the Circle tool) to draw an arc on top of 
your rectangle (see Figure 3-9). Follow these steps to draw an arc:
 
Figure 3-9: 
Draw an 
arc on top 
of your 
rectangle.
 
Click here to start 
Click up here third
Click here second
 
a. Click the upper-left corner of the rectangle to place one endpoint 
of your arc. Make sure that you see the green Endpoint hint before 
you click.
 
b. Click the upper-right corner of the rectangle to place the other end-
point of your arc.
 
c. Move your cursor up to “bow out” the line you’re drawing into an 
arc, and click when you’re happy with how it looks.
 
9. Select the Eraser tool and then click the horizontal line between the 
rectangle and the arc to erase that line.
 
10. Push/pull the doorway inward.
 
 Use the Push/Pull tool (which you’re an old hand with by now) to push 
the “doorway” face you created in Steps 7 through 9 in just a bit.
 
 You use Push/Pull by clicking a face once to start, moving your cursor to 
“push/pull” it in or out, and then clicking again to stop.

65
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
11. Erase the horizontal line at the bottom of the doorway by clicking it 
with the Eraser tool.
 
 This makes the line (and the whole face above it) disappear. Figure 3-10 
shows what your finished doghouse should look like.
 
Figure 3-10: 
Create 
the door 
opening 
by erasing 
its bottom 
edge.

points, angles, and more, flip to Chapter 2.
Slapping on Some Paint
 
I have an ulterior motive for getting you to paint your doghouse: To color 
it, you have to understand how to spin it around first. Moving around your 
model is the most important skill to develop when you’re first learning 
SketchUp. Run through these steps to apply colors (and textures) to the faces 
in your model, and to find out about moving around while you’re doing it:
 
1. Choose Window➪Materials to open the Materials dialog box (see 
Figure 3-11). Click a color or texture you like.
 
 When you do, you automatically “pick up” the Paint Bucket tool and fill 
it with your chosen material.
 
2. Paint some of the faces in your model by clicking any face you want to 
paint with the Paint Bucket tool.
 
3. Switch materials.
 
 Choose another material from the Materials dialog box by clicking it.
 
4. Paint the rest of the faces you can see. (Refer to Figure 3-12.)
 
 Loop through Steps 2 to 4 for as long as you like. Finding the Materials 
dialog box in SketchUp is just like getting a brand-new box of crayons 
when you were little (you know, the big box, with the built-in sharpener).

Figure 3-12:

5. Choose the Orbit tool; it’s just to the left of the creepy white hand on 
the toolbar.
 
6. Click somewhere on the left side of your screen and drag your cursor 
over to the right. (See Figure 3-13.) Release your mouse button when 
you’re done.
 
 Your model spins! This is called orbiting. Orbit around some more, just 
to get the hang of it.
 
 If you’re orbiting, and you’ve dragged your cursor over as far as it will 
go, and you haven’t orbited as much as you wanted to, don’t fret. Just 
release the mouse button, move your cursor over to where it was when 
you started orbiting, and orbit some more by clicking and dragging. You 
usually can’t see what you want to see with a single orbit; you need a 
bunch of separate drags (separate orbits, I guess) to get things looking 
the way you want them to.

67
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
Figure 3-13: 
Choose the 
Orbit tool 
and drag 
your 
cursor to 
spin your 
model 
around.
 
 
7. Zoom in and out if you need to by selecting the Zoom tool and 
dragging your cursor up and down in your modeling window.
 
 The Zoom tool looks like a magnifying glass, and it’s on the other side of 
the creepy white hand. Dragging up zooms in, and down zooms out.
 
8. If needed, move around in two dimensions with the Pan tool by 
selecting it and then clicking and dragging the Pan cursor inside your 
modeling window.
 
 The Pan tool is the creepy white hand between Orbit and Zoom. You use 
Pan to slide your model around inside your modeling window without 
spinning it around or making it look bigger or smaller. You can pan in 
any direction.
 
9. Use the Orbit, Zoom, Pan, and Paint Bucket tools to finish painting 
your doghouse.
 
 Now that you know how to move around your model, here’s how I’d like 
you to paint it (Color Plate 8 shows what it should look like):
 
• Paint the exterior walls red-brown.
 
• Paint the roof light blue.
 
• Paint the interior yellow-orange.
 
When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to get a little lost with the navigation 
tools (Orbit, Zoom, and Pan); it happens to everybody. If you find yourself in 
a pickle, just choose Camera➪Zoom Extents. When you do, SketchUp auto-
matically plunks your model right in front of you; check out Figure 3-14 to see 
Zoom Extents in action. Just so you know, Zoom Extents is also a button on 
the toolbar; it’s right next to the Zoom tool.
Chapter 2 is the place to look for extra tips and tricks on orbiting, zooming, 
and panning, as well as for details about using the Materials dialog box to 
paint the faces of an object.

Giving Your Model Some Style
SketchUp Styles allow you to change your model’s appearance — the way it’s 
drawn, basically — with just a few clicks of your mouse. You can create your 
own styles, of course, but SketchUp also comes with a library of pre-made 
ones that you can use without knowing anything about how they work.
Follow these steps to try out a couple of styles on your doghouse:
 
1. Choose Window➪Styles.
 
 The Styles dialog box opens.
 
2. Click the Select tab to show the Select pane.
 
3. In the Libraries drop-down menu (see Figure 3-15), choose the 
Assorted Styles library.
 
Figure 3-15: 
The 
Assorted 
Styles 
library is a 
sampler of 
ready-mixed 
SketchUp 
styles.
 

69
 Chapter 3: Getting Off to a Running Start
 
4. Click through the different styles to see what they’re about.
 
 When you click a style in the Styles dialog box, that style is applied to 
your model. Figure 3-16 shows our doghouse with a few different styles 
applied — can you figure out which ones?
 
Figure 3-16:

very differ-
ent styles

5. Go back to your original style.
 
 Click the little house icon in the Styles dialog box to see a list of all the 
Styles you’ve applied to your model. Find the one called “Architectural 
Design Style” (it should be first in the list) and click to choose it.
Switching on the Sun
 
You’re about to use what I consider to be one of SketchUp’s best features: 
shadows. When you turn on shadows, you’re activating SketchUp’s built-in 
sun. The shadows you see in your modeling window are accurate for whatever 
time and location you set. For the purposes of this example, though, don’t 
worry about accuracy. Go through these steps to let the light shine in:
 
1. Use Orbit, Zoom, and Pan to get an aerial, three-quarter view of your 
doghouse, sort of like the one shown in Figure 3-17.

70

Figure 3-17: 
Use Orbit, 
Zoom, and 
Pan to navi-
gate around 
until your 
model looks 
something 
like this.
 
 
2. Choose Window➪Shadows.
 
 This opens the Shadow Settings dialog box (as shown in Figure 3-18).
 
Figure 3-18: 
The Shadow

dialog box

3. Select the Display Shadows check box to turn on the sun.
 
 Your doghouse should be casting a shadow on the ground.
 
4. In the Shadow Settings dialog box, move the Time slider back and 
forth.
 
 Changing the time of day means that you’re moving SketchUp’s sun 
around in the sky. When the sun moves around, so do your shadows. 
Take a look at Figure 3-19 to see what I mean.

Sharing Your Masterpiece
Now that you have a model that looks about the way you want it to, you 
probably want to show it to someone. The easiest way to do that is by 
exporting a JPEG image that you can attach to an e-mail. Follow these steps 
and you’ll be on your way:
 
1. Navigate around (using Orbit, Zoom, and Pan) until you like the view 
of your model that you see in your modeling window.
 
2. Choose File➪Export➪2D Graphic.
 
3. In the Export dialog box that opens, choose JPEG from the Export 
Type drop-down menu.
 
4. Pick a location on your computer system, and give your exported 
image a name.
 
5. Click the Export button to create a JPEG image of what’s visible in 
your modeling window.
Exporting a JPEG file is just one way to share models. To find out about all 
your options, see Part IV, which explains how to share your model on Google 
Earth, as a printout, as an image or animation, or as a slick presentation that 
will (hopefully) impress all your friends.

Part II
Modeling in 
SketchUp

In this part . . .
W
hen all is said and done, SketchUp is about making 
3D models. Sure, you can paint them, make anima-
tions with them, print them, and e-mail images of them to 
your friends, but first you have to actually create them.
Chapter 4 makes the assumption that sooner or later, 
you’re going to want to use SketchUp to make a model of a 
building. Starting with drawing simple floor plans and pro-
ceeding into the transition from 2D to 3D, modeling stairs 
and creating roofs, this chapter does its best to get you 
started.
In Chapters 5 and 6, I go over all the different ways you 
can organize your model; doing so improves your model-
ing efficiency, your computer’s performance, and ulti-
mately, your sanity. You don’t have to be a tidy person to 
“work clean” in SketchUp — I’m living proof.
Don’t want to use SketchUp to just model buildings? 
Chapter 7 describes how to use things like components 
and the Follow Me tool to create some pretty advanced 
models.
Chapter 8 talks about how you can use photographs in 
SketchUp, both to “paint” your faces, and to create whole 
models based on photographs of objects like buildings 
and furniture.

Chapter 4
Building Buildings
In This Chapter
▶ Drafting a simple floorplan
▶ Going from a 2D plan to a 3D model
▶ Inserting doors and windows
▶ Modeling stairs
▶ Adding a roof
E
ven though SketchUp lets you make (just about) anything you can think 
of, certain forms are easier to make than others. Fortunately, these 
kinds of shapes are exactly the ones that most people want to make with 
SketchUp, most of the time. That’s no accident; SketchUp was designed with 
architecture in mind, so the whole paradigm — the fact that SketchUp models 
are made of faces and edges, and the kinds of tools it offers — is perfect for 
making things like buildings.
But what about curvy, swoopy buildings? You can use SketchUp to make 
those, too, but they’re a little harder, so I don’t think they’re a good place to 
start. Because most of us live in boxy places with right-angled rooms and flat 
ceilings, that kind of architecture is relatively easy to understand.
In this chapter I introduce you to some of the fundamentals of SketchUp mod-
eling in terms of making simple, rectilinear buildings. By writing about how 
to build certain kinds of things, instead of just describing what the individual 
tools do, I hope to make it easier for you to get started. Even if you’re not 
planning to use SketchUp to model any of the things I describe, you should 
still be able to apply these concepts to your own creations.
 
One more thing: Just about every page in this chapter relies heavily on the 
stuff I introduce in Chapter 2. Working with the colored drawing axes, select-
ing objects, navigating around your model, and drawing things accurately are 
pretty key to making anything in SketchUp, so be prepared to flip back and 
forth while you’re getting used to how things work. I like to use paper clips as 
bookmarks, but I’m sure you have your own method. . . .

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Drawing Floors and Walls
Most floors and walls are flat surfaces, so it’s easy to model them with 
straight edges and flat faces in SketchUp. In fact, chances are good that the 
first thing you ever modeled in SketchUp looked a lot like the floor and walls 
of a building.
I can think of two different kinds of architectural models that most people 
want to create in SketchUp; how you approach modeling floors and walls 
depends entirely on the type of model you’re making:
 
✓ Exterior: An exterior model of a building is basically just an empty shell; 
you don’t have interior walls, rooms, or furniture to worry about. This 
type of model is a slightly simpler proposition for folks who are just 
starting out.
 
✓ Interior: An interior model of a building is significantly more complicated 
than an exterior-only one; dealing with interior wall thicknesses, floor 
heights, ceilings, and furnishings involves a lot more modeling prowess.
 
Here’s the thing: Because everything in SketchUp is made up of super-flat 
faces (they have no thickness), the only way to model a wall that’s, say, 8 
inches thick is to use two faces side by side and 8 inches apart. For models 
where you need to show wall thicknesses — namely, interior models — this 
is what you’ll have to do. Exterior models are easier to make because you can 
use single faces to represent walls. Figure 4-1 shows what I’m talking about.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Use single 
faces for 
exterior 
models 
and double 
faces for 
interior 
ones.
 
Single-face walls
Double-face walls
 
One of the biggest mistakes new SketchUp users make is attempting an 
“inside-outside” model right off the bat. Making a model that shows both the 
interior and the exterior of a building at the same time is, to be honest, way 
too hard when you’re just getting started. Instead, build two separate models 
if you need both interior and exterior views. If you need a combination model 
later on, you’ll be able to build it in a quarter of the time it took you to build 
either of the first two — I guarantee it.

77
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
Starting out in 2D
Of course, you can make a 3D model of a building’s interior in lots of different
ways, but I’m going to show you the one I think makes the most sense. 
Basically, it involves drawing a two-dimensional floorplan that includes all 
your interior and exterior walls, and then pulling it up to be the right height. 
In my method, you don’t worry about doors, windows, or stairs until after 
your model is extruded; you put them in afterward, which I think is an easier 
and more logical way to work.
 
If you’re importing a floorplan from another piece of software like AutoCAD 
or VectorWorks, I think you’ll appreciate this approach — it lets you take 2D 
information and make it 3D, regardless of where it comes from.
Even though SketchUp is a 3D modeling program through and through, it’s 
not a bad tool for drawing simple 2D plans. The toolset is adequate and easy 
to use, and doing a couple of things before you get started will help a lot. 
 
The thing to keep in mind is that SketchUp isn’t a full-fledged drafting pro-
gram, and it probably never will be. 
If you’re an architect-type who needs to do heavy-duty CAD (computer-aided 
drawing) work, you should probably be drafting in another piece of soft-
ware and importing your work into SketchUp when you need 3D. If you’re 
just drawing your house or the place where you work, look no farther — 
SketchUp should do just fine.
Switching to a 2D view
If you’re going to use SketchUp to draw a 2D plan, the first thing you need to 
do is orient your point of view. It’s easiest to draw in 2D when you’re directly 
above your work, looking down at the ground plane. You also want to make 
sure that you’re not seeing things in perspective, which distorts your view of 
what you have.
 
Follow these simple steps to set things up (and find additional help on this 
book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/SketchUp7FD):
 
1. Create a new SketchUp file.
 
 Depending on the template you have set to open when you create a 
new SketchUp file, you might already be in a 2D view. If all you see 
are the red and green axes on a white background, you can skip Step 
2. Remember that you can always switch templates by choosing 
Help➪Welcome to SketchUp and clicking on the Templates section of 
the dialog box that pops up.
 
2. Choose Camera➪Standard➪Top.
 
 This changes your viewpoint so that you’re looking directly down at the 
ground.

78
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Choose Camera➪Parallel Projection.
 
 Switching from Perspective to Parallel Projection makes it easier to draw 
plans in 2D. At this point, your modeling window should look like the 
one shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Your model-
ing window 
should look 
like this 
before you 
start draw-
ing in 2D.

Red axis
 
Feel free to delete Sang. That little diagonal line that’s visible in your model-
ing window when you’re in Top view is a top view of Sang — the 2D guy who 
appears in every new SketchUp file you create. To get rid of Sang, just right-
click him and choose Erase.
Dusting off SketchUp’s drafting tools
 
Here’s some good news: You don’t need many tools to draft a 2D plan in 
SketchUp. Figure 4-3 shows the basic toolbar; everything you need is right 
there:

79
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
Figure 4-3: 
All the tools 
you need to 
draft in 2D 
in SketchUp 
are on the 
basic 
toolbar.
 
Line
Circle
Arc
Eraser
Select
Tape
Measure
Zoom
Zoom
Extents
Offset
Pan
 
✓ Line tool: You use the Line tool (which looks like a pencil) to draw 
edges, which are one of the two basic building blocks of SketchUp 
models. Fundamentally, you click to start drawing an edge and click 
again to finish it. (You can find lots more information about drawing 
lines in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Eraser tool: You use the Eraser to erase edges; see Figure 4-4. Keep in 
mind that you can’t use the Eraser to delete faces, though erasing one of 
the edges that defines a face automatically erases that face, too. Take a 
look at the section about edges and faces at the beginning of Chapter 2 
for more detail on this. You can use the Eraser in two different ways:
 
• Clicking: Click edges to erase them one at a time.
 
• Dragging: Click and drag over edges to erase them; this is faster if 
you have lots of edges you want to get rid of.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Use the 
Eraser tool 
to erase 
edges. 
Erasing an 
edge that 
defines a 
face erases

too.

✓ Circle tool: Drawing circles in SketchUp is pretty easy: You click once 
to define the center and again to define a point on the circle (which 
also defines the radius). To enter in a precise radius, just draw a circle, 
type in a radius, and press Enter (see Figure 4-5). For more information 
on typing while you draw, check out the section on model accuracy in 
Chapter 2.

Type the radius you want and

✓ Arc tool: To draw an arc, you click once to define one end, again to 
define the other end, and a third time to define the bulge (how much the 
arc sticks out). If you want, you can type in a radius after you draw your 
arc by entering the radius, the units, and the letter r. If you want an arc 
with a radius of 4 feet, you would draw it however big, type in 4'r, and 
press Enter. This is shown in Figure 4-6.

Arc tool is a 
three-step 
operation.

 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
✓ Offset tool: The Offset tool helps you draw edges that are a constant 
distance apart from edges that already exist in your model. Pictures 
are usually better than words, so take a look at Figure 4-7. Using Offset 
on the shape I’ve drawn lets me create another shape that’s exactly 6 
inches bigger all the way around (middle image), or 6 inches smaller all 
the way around (right image). Offsetting edges is a useful way to create 
things like doorways and window trim.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Offset 
lets you 
create 
edges 
based on 
other edges.
 
Click to start drawing; then
move your cursor
6 inch outside offset
6 inch inside offset
 
 You can use Offset in two ways; for both ways you click once to start off-
setting and again to stop:
 
• Click a face to offset all its edges. If nothing is selected, clicking 
a face with the Offset tool lets you offset all that face’s edges by a 
constant amount (as shown in Figure 4-7).
 
• Preselect one or more coplanar (on the same plane) edges, and 
then use Offset. If you have some edges selected, you can use 
Offset on just those edges; this comes in handy for drawing things 
like doorframes and balconies, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Using Offset 
on a set of 
preselected 
edges is 
handy for 
drawing 
things like 
doorframes.
 
Select the edges you want to offset
Use Offset to create more edges

82
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ Tape Measure tool: The Tape Measure is one of those tools that does 
a bunch of different things. To use it for measuring distances, click any 
two points in your model to measure the distance between them. The 
distance readout is in the Measurements box, in the lower-right corner 
of your modeling window. You can also use it for sizing a model and for 
creating guides, as I explain in Chapter 2.
Coming up with a simple plan
If all you’re trying to do is model an exterior view of a building, just measure 
around the perimeter, draw the outline of the building in SketchUp, and pro-
ceed from there. (See Figure 4-9.) Your walls will only be a single face thick 
(meaning paper-thin), but that’s okay — you’re only interested in the outside, 
anyway.
 
Figure 4-9: 
To make 
an exterior 
model, just 
measure the 
outside of 
your build-
ing to draw 
an outline in 
SketchUp.
 
If, on the other hand, you want to create an interior view, your life is a little 
bit more complicated. The business of measuring an existing building so that 
you can model it on the computer is easier said than done — even experi-
enced architects and builders often get confused when trying to create as-
builts, as drawings of existing buildings are called. Closets, ventilation spaces, 
interior walls, and all kinds of other obstructions inevitably get in the way of 
getting good measurements; most of the time, you just have to give it your 
best shot and then tweak things a bit to make them right.
Drawing an interior outline
Because the main goal of making an interior model of a building is to end up 
with accurate interior spaces, you need to work from the inside out. If your 
tape measure is long enough, try to figure out a way to get the major dimen-
sions first — this means the total interior width and length of the inside of 
your building. You might not be able to, but do your best. After that, it’s 
really just a matter of working your way around, using basic arithmetic and 
logic to figure things out.

83
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
It really helps to make a paper drawing before you start in with SketchUp. 
You’ll know what you need to do, leaving all your concentration for drafting 
on the computer. Figure 4-10 shows the paper sketch I used when modeling 
my own house.
 
Figure 4-10: 
This is 
the paper 
sketch I 
used to 
model my 
house in 
SketchUp.
 
 
From this paper drawing, here’s how I would draw a basic interior outline of 
my house:
 
1. I switch into a 2D, overhead view.
 
 The section “Switching to a 2D view,” earlier in this chapter, explains 
how.
 
2. Using the Line tool, I draw an edge 17 feet long (see Figure 4-11, top 
left), representing the eastern wall of the house.

84
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
 To draw it, I click once to start the edge, move my cursor up until I see 
the green linear inference (indicating that I’m drawing parallel to the 
green axis), and click again to end my line. To make it 17 feet long, I type 
in 17’ and then press Enter — the line resizes itself automatically to be 
exactly 17 feet in length. If I wanted to, I could use the Tape Measure to 
double-check what I did.
 
Figure 4-11: 
I start by 
drawing an 
edge 17 feet 
long; then I 
draw a per-
pendicular 
edge 11 feet 
10 inches 
long.
 
3. Draw another edge
4. Type 11’10
11’10 and press Enter
Finish
1. Start
2. Type 17’
17’ and press Enter
 
3. I draw an edge 11 feet 10 inches long, starting at the end of the first 
edge, heading to the right in the red direction. (See Figure 4-11, 
bottom right.)
 
 To do this, I do exactly what I did to draw the first edge, except that I 
move parallel to the red axis this time, type in 11’10, and then press 
Enter.
 
4. I keep going all the way around the house, until I get back to where I 
started. (See Figure 4-12.)
 
 If I make a mistake, I either use the Eraser to get rid of edges I’m 
unhappy with or I choose Edit➪Undo to go back a step or two.

85
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings

pleted

perimeter of 
my house.
 
Edge

5. If all my measurements don’t add up, I adjust things so that they do — 
a few extra inches here and there never killed anyone, after all.
 
 After I completed my outline (forming a closed loop of edges that were 
all on the same plane), a face automatically appeared. Now I have a total 
of 11 edges and 1 face.
 
When you’re drafting in 2D, whatever you do, don’t use the Orbit tool. 
Because you’re working in 2D, you only need to use Zoom and Pan to navigate 
around your drawing. (See Chapter 2 for more information on this.) If you 
accidentally end up orbiting your model into a 3D view, follow the steps in the 
section “Switching to a 2D view,” earlier in this chapter, to get things back in 
order.
 
If you get lost, and no amount of zooming and panning gets you back to a view 
of your floorplan, choose Camera➪Zoom Extents — think of it as an emer-
gency lever you can pull to fill your modeling window with your geometry.
Offsetting an exterior wall
 
I decided to offset (using the Offset tool) an exterior wall thickness, just to 
make it easier to visualize my spaces. Here’s how I do it:

86
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
1. Using the Offset tool, I offset my closed shape by 8 inches to the 
outside. (See Figure 4-13, left.)
 
 An offset of 8 inches is a pretty standard thickness for an exterior wall, 
especially for houses in my neck of the woods. This is how I use the 
Offset tool:
 
a. I make sure that nothing is selected by choosing Edit➪Select None.
 
b. I click once inside my shape.
 
c. I click again outside my shape to make a second, bigger shape.
 
d. I type in 8 and then press Enter.
 
Figure 4-13: 
I use Offset 
to create an 
exterior wall 
thickness, 
and then 
I do some 
cleanup 
using the 
Line and 
Eraser tools.
 
Offset an exterior wall
thickness
Draw in edges
Delete unwanted edges
 
2. Because I know there are no alcoves on the exterior, I use the Line 
tool to close them off, creating pockets of wall that are thicker than 
the rest. (See Figure 4-13, middle.)
 
3. I use the Eraser tool to get rid of the extra edges. (See Figure 4-13, 
right.)
 
 By deleting the extra edges, I go back to having only two faces: one 
representing the floor and one representing the exterior wall thickness. 
It doesn’t matter that the wall is thicker in a couple of places; I can 
always go back and fiddle with it later on.
Putting in the interior walls
For this part of the process, I use guides a lot. If you haven’t done so already, 
read Chapter 2 and check out the last part — you’ll find a full description of 
guides and how to use them.
 
When I’m drafting a floorplan in SketchUp, I find it really helps to ignore things 
like doors and windows — where a doorway should be in a wall, I just draw a 
solid wall. I like to add in doors and windows after I’ve extruded my floorplan 
into a three-dimensional figure.

87
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
Here’s how I put in the few interior walls on the first floor of my house:
 
1. With the Tape Measure tool, I drag a parallel guide 5 feet, 3
1⁄2 inches 
from the inside of my entryway. (See Figure 4-14, left.)
 
 To do this, I just click the edge from which I want to draw the guide, 
move my cursor to the right (to tell SketchUp which way to go), type 
5’3.5, and press Enter.
 
Figure 4-14: 
I draw a 
guide to 
help me 
locate my 
first interior 
wall, and 
then I draw 
a bunch 
more.
 
Create a parallel guide
Create more guides
Draw edges using your guides
 
2. I draw a few more guides the same way I drew the first one.
 
 Working from my pencil drawing, I figure out the location of each inte-
rior wall, and I create guides to measure off the space. (See Figure 4-14, 
right.)
 
3. Switching to the Line tool, I draw in edges to represent the interior 
walls.
 
 By using the guides as, er, guides, it’s easy to draw my edges correctly. 
Figure 4-15 shows what I have so far.
 
 Don’t forget to zoom! When you have a jumble of edges and guides, and 
you can’t see what you’re doing, just zoom in. It sounds obvious, but 
you’d be surprised how many folks forget to change their point of view 
while they’re working — it makes all the difference.
 
4. I use the Eraser to delete my guides.
 
5. I use the Eraser to get rid of all the extra edge segments. (See Figure 
4-16.)
 
 By doing this, I go back to only having two faces in my model (one for 
the floor and one for the walls). When it is time to extrude my plan into 
walls, as I explain in a moment, performing this step will help out a lot.

Going from 2D to 3D
With a 2D plan in hand, the next step is to extrude it into a 3D model. This 
is basically a one-step process, and it involves the tool that made SketchUp 
famous: Push/Pull. In the following sections, I take a simple floorplan (one I 
drew earlier in this chapter) and turn it into three-dimensional walls.

89
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
Getting a good view
 
Before I pop up my plan into the third dimension, I need to change my point 
of view to get a better view of what I’m doing. (See Figure 4-17.) Follow these 
steps:
 
Figure 4-17: 
Before I 
start work-
ing in 3D, 
I switch 
over to a 3D 
view.
 
Switch to Perspective view
Switch to Iso view
Zoom Extents
 
1. Choose Camera➪Perspective.
 
 This turns on SketchUp’s perspective engine, meaning that now I can see 
things more realistically — the way people really see things in 3D.
 
2. Choose Camera➪Standard➪Iso.
 
 This switches me from a top view to an isometric (three-quarter) one. I 
could do this with the Orbit tool, too — you always have more than one 
way to do everything in SketchUp.
 
3. Choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
 
 Zoom Extents has its own button on the basic toolbar, but I thought I’d 
stick with the Camera menu theme, just for consistency.

90
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
4. Choose Camera➪Field of View, type in 45, and press Enter.
 
 You’ve changed the field of view from 35 to 45 degrees. By default, 
SketchUp’s field of view is set to 35 degrees. (For more information on 
what this means, check out Chapter 10.)
Pushing/pulling your way to happiness
The Push/Pull tool is a simple creature; you use it to extrude flat faces into 
3D shapes. It works (like everything else in SketchUp) by clicking — you click 
a face once to start pushing/pulling it, move your cursor until you like what 
you see, and then click again to stop push/pulling. That’s it. I doubt that any 
software tool has ever been so satisfyingly easy to use and understand. For 
more detail on Push/Pull, see the nearby sidebar, “More fun with Push/Pull.”
 
Push/Pull only works on flat faces; if you need to do something to a curved 
face, you’ll have to use something else. Read about the Intersect with Model 
feature in the section “Getting to know Intersect with Model,” later in this 
chapter — it might be what you’re looking for.
 
To use Push/Pull to extrude my house’s first floorplan into a 3D model, this is 
what I do. (See Figure 4-18.)
 
Figure 4-18: 
I use Push/
Pull to 
extrude one 
of my faces 
into all the 
walls in 
my house. 
Presto!
 
Click to start Push/Pulling
Move your cursor
Type a height and press Enter
 
1. Select the Push/Pull tool from the toolbar.
 
 It looks like a little box with a red arrow coming out the top.
 
2. Click the wall’s face once to start extruding it.
 
 If I click the “floor” face, I would end up extruding that, instead. If you 
choose the wrong face by accident, press Esc to cancel the operation, 
and try again.
 
3. I move my cursor up to pull up the walls; click to stop extruding.
 
 It doesn’t matter how much I extrude my face, because I’m going to add 
precision in the next step.

91
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
4. I type 8' and press Enter.
 
 When I do this, my push/pull distance is revised to be exactly 8 feet — 
the height of the walls in my house.
 
If you forget to erase any little edge segments before using Push/Pull, all your 
walls might not be pulled up at once. In this case, use Push/Pull again on any 
faces that need it.
Adding doors and windows
You can make openings in your walls in a couple of different ways. What you 
choose to do depends on what kind of building you’re modeling, whether 
you’re using single-face or double-face walls, and how much detail you plan 
to include in your model. You have two options:
 
✓ Use SketchUp components that cut openings themselves. SketchUp 
comes with a handful of sample doors and windows that you can drag 
and drop into your model. The really cool thing about these is that they 
cut their own openings when you place them. Here’s the catch, though: 
SketchUp’s “cut opening” components only work on single-face walls, 
which means that they’re really only useful for exterior building models. If 
you’re building an interior model, you’ll have to cut your own openings.
 
✓ Cut openings yourself. For double-face walls, this is your only option; 
luckily, it’s easy to do. Basically, you draw an outline for the opening 
you want to create, and then you use Push/Pull to create the opening — 
it works the same way for doors and windows.
Using SketchUp’s handy-dandy components
As long as you’re making an exterior model, you can use the doors and win-
dows that come with SketchUp. These are components, which you can read 
more about in Chapter 5. Without going into a ton of detail, here’s what you 
need to know about them:
 
✓ They’re accessible from the Components dialog box. Choose 
Window➪Components to open the dialog box, and then choose the 
“Architecture” collection from the Navigation drop-down menu (it looks 
like an upside-down triangle). The “Doors” and “Windows” collections 
are in there somewhere. Keep in mind that you need to be online for this 
to work — the collections are hosted on Google’s 3D Warehouse, some-
where in cyberspace.
 
✓ You can find hundreds more online. If you’re connected to the Internet, 
you can type any search query (like “revolving door”) into the little 
search area at the top of the Components dialog box. This scours the 
3D Warehouse for whatever you’re looking for, and shows the results 
below. Some advice: There’s lots of stuff in the world, so be specific.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
More fun with Push/Pull
Because Push/Pull is the tool that most people 
think of when they think of SketchUp, I thought 
you might appreciate knowing more about 
what it can do. The people who invented this 
software (back in the last millennium) started 
with the idea for Push/Pull — that’s how closely 
linked SketchUp and Push/Pull are. Here are 
four things about Push/Pull that aren’t immedi-
ately obvious when you first start using it:
 ✓ Double-click with the Push/Pull tool to 
extrude a face by the last distance you 
pushed/pulled. When you double-click a 
face, it automatically gets pushed/pulled by 
the same amount as the last face you used 
Push/Pull on.
 ✓ Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to push/pull 
a copy of your face. The first graphic in 
the following figure shows what I’m talk-
ing about here. Instead of using Push/Pull 
the regular way, you can use a modifier 
key to extrude a copy of the face you’re 
pushing/pulling. This comes in super-handy 
for modeling things like multistory buildings 
quickly.
 ✓ While pushing/pulling, hover over other 
parts of your geometry to tell SketchUp how 
far to extrude. Take a look at the second 
graphic. Perhaps I want to use Push/Pull to 
extrude a cylinder that is exactly the same 
height as my box. Before I click the second 
time to stop pushing/pulling, I hover over a 
point on the top of the box; now the cylinder 
is exactly that tall. To complete the opera-
tion, I click while I’m still hovering over the 
box. It’s pretty simple, and it’ll save you 
hours of time after you’re used to doing it.
 ✓ Pushing/pulling a face into another, copla-
nar face automatically cuts a hole. In fact, 
this is how you make openings (like doors 
and windows) in double-face walls. The 
last graphic shows this in action.
Hit Control 
(Option on Mac)
 to copy your face
Click while 
you’re hovering
Push/Pull a face all the

✓ They are editable. I go into lots of detail about this in Chapter 5, but 
here’s the gist: If you don’t like something about one of SketchUp’s 
built-in doors or windows, you can change it.
 
✓ Some are dynamic. In SketchUp 7, some components have special 
abilities that make them easier to resize and otherwise reconfigure. You 
can read all about Dynamic Components in Chapter 5. 
 
✓ They cut their own openings, but the openings aren’t permanent. 
When you move or delete a door or window component you’ve placed, 
its opening goes with it.

Adding a hole-cutting component to your model is a piece of cake. Follow 
these steps to do it yourself. (See Figure 4-19.)

Chapter 2) to reposition your component.
Figure 4-20 shows a simple building to which I’ve added a door and a couple 
of window components. Notice how I use guides to line things up — doing so 
is the best way to make sure that everything’s in the right spot.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Making your own openings
Most of the time, you won’t be able to get away with using SketchUp’s built-
in door and window components — the fact that they can’t cut through 
two-faced walls means that they’re limited to external use only. That’s okay 
though; cutting your own holes in walls is quick and easy, and you’ll always 
end up with exactly what you want.
 
To cut a precise opening in a double-face wall, here’s what you need to do; 
Figure 4-21 shows the basic steps:
 
1. Mark where you want your opening to be with guides.
 
 For a refresher on using guides, have a look at the section “Making and 
using guides,” in Chapter 2.
 
2. Draw the outline of the opening you want to create, making sure to 
create a new face in the process.
 
 You can use any of the drawing tools to do this, though I recommend 
sticking with the Line tool when you’re starting out. You’ll know you’ve 
made a new face if the edges in your outline look thin; if they don’t, check 
out the nearby sidebar, “Working through thick and thin,” for more info.
 
3. Use Push/Pull to extrude your new face back into the thickness of the 
wall until it touches the face behind it.
 
 If everything goes well, your face should disappear, taking with it the 
corresponding area of the face behind it. Now you have an opening in 
your wall. If your face doesn’t disappear, and no opening is created, it’s 
probably for one of the following reasons:
 
• Your faces aren’t parallel to each other. This technique only 
works if both faces are parallel. Keep in mind that just because two 
faces look parallel doesn’t mean that they are.
 
• You hit an edge. If you push/pull your face into a face with an edge 
crossing it, SketchUp gets confused and doesn’t cut an opening. 
Use Undo, get rid of the pesky edge (if you can), and try again.

to plan 
where you 
want an 
opening,

Don’t forget to orbit! If you can’t quite push/pull what you mean to push/pull, 
orbit around until you can see what you’re doing.
Staring Down Stairs
There are probably a million different ways to make stairs in SketchUp, but 
(naturally) I have my favorites. In the following sections, you’ll find two dif-
ferent methods that work equally well; take a look at both of them and then 
decide which works best for your situation. In the last part of Chapter 5, I 
describe a third, slightly trickier (but way more powerful) way of making 
stairs using components; feel free to take a look if you’re feeling more 
advanced.
Working through thick and thin
Pay attention to which edges look thick and 
which ones look thin. When you’re drawing in 2D, 
you can tell a lot from an edge’s appearance:
 ✓ Thin edges cut through faces. Edges that 
are thin are ones that have “sunk in”; you 
can think of them like cuts from a razor-
sharp knife. When you successfully split a 
face with an edge that you draw with the 
Line tool, it looks thin. The first image in 
the following figure shows what I’m talking 
about.
 ✓ Thick edges sit on top of faces. If the edge 
you just drew looks thicker than some of 
the other edges in your model, it isn’t actu-
ally cutting through the face it’s on — it’s 
only sitting on top. Most of the time, this is 
because it has one free end. So-called free 
edges aren’t connected to other edges at 
both ends (see the second image).
This edge is sunken
Free (one-sided) edges don’t sink in

96
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
SketchUp 7 introduced Dynamic Components, which has some pretty neat 
implications for people who need stairs to use in their models. So-called 
dynamic stair components automatically add or subtract individual steps as 
you make them bigger or smaller with the Scale tool. Depending on what 
you’re trying to accomplish, one of these pre-made dynamic stair components 
might save you a bunch of time. Find out more about them in the Dynamic 
Components section of Chapter 5.
Before I dive in, here’s some simple stairway vocabulary, just in case you 
need it; take a look at Figure 4-22 for a visual reference:
 
✓ Rise and run: The rise is the total distance your staircase needs to 
climb. If the vertical distance from your first floor to your second (your 
floor-to-floor distance) is 10 feet, that’s your rise. The run is the total 
horizontal distance your staircase takes up. A set of stairs with a big rise 
and a small run would be really steep.
 
✓ Tread: A tread is an individual step — the part of the staircase you step 
on. When someone refers to the size of a tread, he’s talking about the 
depth — the distance from the front to the back of the tread. Typically, 
this is anywhere from 9 to 24 inches, but treads of 10 to 12 inches are 
most comfortable to walk on.
 
✓ Riser: The riser is the part of the step that connects each tread in the 
vertical direction. Risers are usually about 5 to 7 inches high, but that 
depends on your building. Not all staircases have actual risers (think of 
steps with gaps between treads), but they all have a riser height.
 
✓ Landing: A landing is a platform somewhere around the middle of a set 
of stairs. Landings are necessary in real life, but modeling them can be a 
pain; figuring out staircases with landings is definitely more complicated. 
Sometimes, it’s easier if you think of your landings as really big steps.
The Subdivided Rectangles method
This is the way most people think to draw their first set of stairs. It’s intuitive 
and simple, but it’s also a bit more time-consuming than the other methods I 
describe in this book.
 
The key to the Subdivided Rectangles method is to use a special trick you 
can do with edges: Called Divide, it lets you pick any edge and divide it up 
into as many segments as you want. If you know how many steps you need to 
draw, but not how deep each individual tread needs to be, this comes in really 
handy.

97
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings

anatomy of 
a staircase.

Here’s how the Subdivided Rectangles method works. (See Figure 4-23.)
 
1. Start by drawing a rectangle the size of the staircase you want to 
build.
 
 I strongly recommend modeling steps as a group, separate from the rest 
of your building, and then moving them into position when they’re done. 
You can read all about groups in Chapter 5.
 
2. With the Select tool, right-click one of the long edges of your rectangle 
and choose Divide.
 
 If your staircase is wider than it is long, right-click one of the short 
edges, instead.
 
3. Before you do anything else, type in the number of treads you want to 
create and press Enter.
 
 This command automatically divides your edge into many more edges, 
eliminating the need to calculate how deep each of your treads needs 
to be. Essentially, each of your new edges will become the side of one of 
your treads.

Connect new endpoints

4. Draw a line from the endpoint of each of your new edges, dividing 
your original rectangle into many smaller rectangles.
 
 You can use the Line or the Rectangle tool to do this; pick whichever 
one you’re most comfortable with.

99
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
5. From one of the corners of your original rectangle, draw a vertical 
edge the height of your staircase’s total rise.
 
6. Use the Divide command to split your new edge into however many 
risers you need in your staircase (generally your number of treads, 
plus one).
 
 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to do this. The endpoints of your new, little edges 
will tell you how high to make each of your steps.
 
7. Push/pull the rectangle that represents your last step to the correct 
height.
 
 Here’s where you need to use the hover-click technique that I describe 
in the sidebar “More fun with Push/Pull,” earlier in this chapter. Just 
click once to start pushing/pulling, hover over the endpoint that 
corresponds to the height of that tread, and click again. Your step will 
automatically be extruded to the right height.
 
 It’s a good idea to start extruding your highest step first, but keep in 
mind that it doesn’t go all the way to the top; you always have a riser 
between your last step and your upper floor.
 
8. Repeat Step 7 for each of your remaining steps.
 
9. Use the Eraser to get rid of any extra edges you don’t need.
 
 Don’t accidentally erase geometry on the part of your staircase you 
can’t see.
The Copied Profile method
This method for modeling a staircase relies, like the last one, on using Push/
Pull to create a three-dimensional form from a 2D face, but I think you’ll agree 
it’s a lot more elegant. In a nutshell, you draw the profile — the side view, 
sort of — of a single step, and then you copy as many steps as you need, 
create a single face, and extrude the whole thing into shape. It’s breathtak-
ingly satisfying the first time you do it — one of those “guaranteed to make 
you smile” SketchUp operations you’ll want to repeat for friends (assuming 
you have nerdy friends like me).
 
Follow these steps to make a staircase using the Copied Profile method. (See 
Figure 4-24.)

then xx, and press Enter
Push/Pull the stair into 3D
 
1. Start with a large, vertical face; make sure that it’s big enough for the 
flight of stairs you want to build.
 
 You’re going to end up pushing/pulling the whole shebang out of the 
side of this face, just so you know.
 
2. In the bottom corner of the face, draw the profile (side outline) of a 
single step.
 
 I usually use the Line tool to do this, though you might want to use an 
arc or two, depending on the level of detail you need. For a refresher on 
drawing lines accurately, check out Chapter 2.
 
3. Select all the edges that make up your step profile.
 
 Remember that you can hold down Shift while clicking with the Select 
tool to add multiple objects to your selection. Chapter 2 has lots of 
selection tips.
 
4. Make a copy of your step profile and place it above your first one.
 
 If you’re unfamiliar with how to make copies using the Move tool, refer 
to the section on moving and copying, toward the end of Chapter 2.
 
5.  Type in the number of steps you’d like to make, type the letter x, and 
then press Enter.
 
 For example, if you wanted ten steps, you would type in 10x. This tech-
nique repeats the copy operation you just did by however many times 
you tell it to; adding an x at the end of the number tells SketchUp you 
want to make copies.

101
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
6. Draw an edge to make sure that all your step profiles are part of a 
single face.
 
 You don’t have to do this step if your stair profiles already fit perfectly 
on your vertical face; if you measured carefully, they just might. If you 
can’t seem to make things work, read the sidebar “Working through 
thick and thin,” earlier in this chapter. That might shed some light on 
what’s going on.
 
7. Push/pull the staircase face out to be the width you need it to be.
 
 This is the part that seems like magic to most folks; I don’t think it ever 
gets old.
 
This method of stairway building also works great in combination with the 
Follow Me tool, which I talk about in Chapter 6. Figure 4-25 should whet your 
appetite — Follow Me is cool beans, all the way around.

Raising the Roof
If you’re lucky, the roof you want to build is fairly simple. Unfortunately, 
home builders sometimes go a little crazy, creating roofs with dozens of 
different pitches (slopes), dormers, and other doodads that make modeling 
them a nightmare. For this reason, I’m going to keep things pretty simple: The 
following sections are dedicated to showing you how to identify and model 
some of the basic roof forms. After that, I tell you about a great tool you can 
use to assemble complicated roofs from less-complicated pieces — it’s called 
Intersect with Model, and I think you’ll get a kick out of it.

102
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
The tricky thing about roofs is that they’re hard to see. If you want to make a 
model of something that already exists, it helps to be able to get a good look 
at it — that’s not always possible with roofs. One neat way to get a better view 
of a roof you’re trying to build is to find it in Google Earth. For more information, 
check out Chapter 11.
 
Always, always make a group out of your whole building before you start 
working on your roof.
Before I dive in, what follows is a brief guide to general roof types and 
terminology; this might come in handy for some of the explanations I give 
later on. Figure 4-26 provides a visual accompaniment to my written 
descriptions:
 
✓ Flat roof: Flat roofs are just that, except they aren’t — if a roof were 
really flat, it would collect water and leak. That’s why even roofs that 
look flat are sloped very slightly.
 
✓ Pitched roof: Any roof that isn’t flat is technically a pitched roof.
 
✓ Shed roof: A shed roof is one that slopes from one side to the other.
 
✓ Gabled roof: Gabled roofs have two planes that slope away from a 
central ridge.
 
✓ Hip roof: A hip roof is one where the sides and ends all slope in different 
directions.
 
✓ Pitch: The angle of a roof surface.
 
✓ Gable: A gable is the pointy section of wall that sits under the peak of a 
pitched roof.
 
✓ Eave: Eaves are the parts of a roof that overhang the building.
 
✓ Fascia: Fascia is the trim around the edge of a roof’s eaves where gutters 
are sometimes attached.
 
✓ Soffit: A soffit is the underside of an overhanging eave.
 
✓ Rake: The rake is the part of a gabled roof that overhangs the gable.
 
✓ Valley: A valley is formed when two roof slopes come together; this is 
where water flows when it rains.
 
✓ Dormer: Dormers are the little things that pop up above roof surfaces. 
They often have windows, and they serve to make attic spaces more 
usable.
 
✓ Parapet: Flat roofs that don’t have eaves have parapets: These are 
extensions of the building’s walls that go up a few feet past the roof 
itself.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Building flat roofs with parapets
 
Good news — SketchUp was practically made for modeling these kinds of 
roofs. By using a combination of the Offset tool and Push/Pull, you should be 
able to make a parapet in under a minute. Follow these steps (see Figure 4-27):
 
Figure 4-27: 
Modeling 
parapets on 
flat-roofed 
buildings is 
easy.
 
Offset to the inside
Push/pull your parapet up
 
1. With the Offset tool, click the top face of your building.
 
2. Click again somewhere inside the same face to create another face.
 
3. Type in the thickness of your parapet, and then press Enter.
 
 This redraws your offset edges to be a precise distance from the edges 
of your original face. How thick should your parapet be? It all depends 
on your building, but most parapets are between 6 and 12 inches thick.
 
4. Push/pull your outside face (the one around the perimeter of your 
roof) into a parapet.
 
5. Type in the height of your parapet, and then press Enter.
Creating eaves for buildings 
with pitched roofs
 
My favorite way to create eaves (roof overhangs) is to use the Offset tool. 
Follow these steps to get the general idea (see Figure 4-28):
 
Figure 4-28: 
Eaves are 
the parts of 
the roof that 
overhang a 
building’s 
walls.

Push/Pull a fascia thickness

105
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
1. Make a group out of your whole building before you start modeling 
the roof.
 
 This makes it easier to keep your roof separate, which in turn makes 
your model easier to work with.
 
2. Use the Line tool to create an outline of the parts of your roof that will 
have eaves of the same height.
 
 The goal here is to end up with a single face to offset. A lot of buildings 
have complex roofs with eaves of all different heights; for the sake of 
this step, just create a face which, when offset, will create roof over-
hangs in the right places.
 
3. Use the Offset tool to create an overhanging face.
 
 For instructions on how to use Offset, see the section “Dusting off 
SketchUp’s drafting tools,” earlier in this chapter.
 
4. Erase the edges of your original face.
 
 A quick way to do this (with the Select tool) is to:
 
a. Double-click inside your first face; this selects both it and the 
edges that define it.
 
b. Press Delete to erase everything that’s selected.
Pitched roofs can make you crazy
That fact notwithstanding, a few tips might 
make building your next one a little easier:
  ✓ Start by making the rest of your building 
a group. Always make a group out of your 
whole building before you start working on 
your roof. If you don’t, your geometry will 
start sticking together, you’ll end up eras-
ing walls by accident, and eventually, you’ll 
lose your mind. On top of that, it’s really 
handy to be able to separate your roof from 
the rest of your building whenever you 
want. You can also group your roof, if that 
makes sense for what you’re doing. Check 
out Chapter 5 for a full rundown on making 
and using groups.
 ✓ Draw a top view of your roof on paper first. 
I find this really helps me figure things out. 
Adding measurements and angles is even 
better — anything so that you know what 
you need to do when you get around to 
using SketchUp.
 ✓ Learn to use the Protractor tool. This tool 
(which is on the Tools menu) is for measur-
ing angles and, more importantly, creat-
ing angled guides. Because sloped roofs 
are all about angles, you probably need 
to use the Protractor sooner or later. The 
best way to find out how it works is to 
open the Instructor dialog box by choosing 
Window➪Instructor and then activating 
the Protractor tool.

106
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
5. Push/pull your overhanging roof face to create a thick fascia.
 
 Different roofs have fasciae of different thicknesses; if you don’t know 
yours, just take your best guess.
Constructing gabled roofs
You can approach the construction of a gabled roof in a bunch of different 
ways (every SketchUp expert has his or her favorite), but I find one method 
in particular that works well on a consistent basis.
 
Follow these steps to build a gabled roof, which is shown in Figure 4-29:
 
Figure 4-29: 
Gabled 
roofs are 
relatively 
easy to 
make in 
SketchUp.
 
Push/pull it back
Create an angled guide with the Protractor
Draw a vertical edge
Complete the roof profile
 
1. Create a roof overhang, following the steps in the previous section.
 
 Most gabled roofs have eaves, so you’ll probably need to do this for 
your building.
 
2. Use the Protractor tool to create an angled guide at the corner of your 
roof.

107
 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
 
 See the nearby sidebar, “Pitched roofs can make you crazy,” for more 
information about drawing angled guides with the Protractor.
 
 Architects and builders often express angles as rise over run ratios. For 
example, a 4:12 (pronounced four in twelve) roof slope rises 4 feet for 
every 12 feet it runs — a 1:12 slope is very shallow, and a 12:12 slope is 
very steep. When using the Protractor tool, SketchUp’s Measurements 
box understands angles expressed as ratios as well as those expressed 
in degrees. Typing 6:12 yields a slope of 6 in 12.
 
3. Use the Line tool to draw a vertical edge from the midpoint of your 
roof to the angled guide you created in Step 1.
 
 The point at which your edge and your guide meet is the height of your 
roof ridge.
 
4. Draw two edges from the top of your vertical line to the corners of 
your roof.
 
 This should cause two triangular faces to be created.
 
5. Erase the vertical edge you drew in Step 3 and the guide you drew in 
Step 1.
 
6. Push/pull your triangular gable back.
 
 If your gabled roof extends all the way to the other end of your build-
ing, push/pull it back that far. If your roof runs into another section of 
roof (as in Figure 4-30), extrude it back until it’s completely “buried.” 
The section “Sticking your roof together,” later in this chapter, has more 
information on what to do when you’re making a complex roof.

If your 
gabled roof 
is part of a

structure, 
it might just 
run into 
another roof 
pitch. Let it. 
Push/pull it all the way into the other roof pitch
 
7. Finish your eaves, fascia, soffit, and rake(s) however you want.
 
 You find lots of different kinds of gabled roof details, so I can’t cover 
them all, but Figure 4-31 shows a few common ones. Instead of writing 
about them (which would get confusing anyway), I’ll let the pictures do 
the talking.

 Chapter 4: Building Buildings
Making hip roofs
 
Believe it or not, building a hip roof is easier than making a gabled one. Hip 
roofs don’t have rakes, which makes them a lot less complicated to model. 
Follow these steps to find out what I mean (see Figure 4-32):
 
Figure 4-32: 
To make 
a hip roof, 
start with a 
gabled one.
 
Measure half-width of your gable
Create a guide that distance
from end of gable
Draw edges connecting ridge and corners 
and erase 3 edges that form gable 
Now you have a hip
 
1. Follow Steps 1 through 5 in the preceding section “Constructing 
gabled roofs.”
 
2. Measure the distance from the midpoint of the gable to the corner of 
the roof.
 
 Because hip roofs have pitches that are the same on all sides, you can 
use a simple trick to figure out where to locate the hip in your roof. It’s a 
lot easier than using the Protractor; trust me.
 
3. With the Tape Measure, create a guide the distance you just measured 
from the end of the gable.

110
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
4. Draw edges from the point on the ridge you just located to the corners 
of your roof.
 
 This does two things: It splits the sides of your roof into two faces each 
and creates a new face (which you can’t see yet) under the gabled end of 
your roof.
 
5. Erase the three edges that form the gabled end of your roof, revealing 
the “hipped” pitch underneath.
 
 Neat, huh? Now all three faces of your roof are the same pitch — just the 
way they should be.
 
6. If appropriate, repeat the process on the other end of your roof.
Sticking your roof together
In general, the newer and more expensive a house is, the more roof slopes 
it has. Who knows why this is the case; it probably has something to do 
with folks thinking complex-roofed houses look more like French chateaus. 
Whether or not crazy roofs (there’s my bias showing again) are a good thing 
isn’t relevant to this book, but I know one thing for sure: They’re a pain in 
the, um, gutters to model.
Getting to know Intersect with Model
Luckily, SketchUp has a relatively little-known feature that often helps when 
it comes to making roofs with lots of pitches: Intersect with Model. Here’s 
what you need to know about this terrific little tool:
 
✓ Intersect with Model makes new geometry from existing geometry. 
That’s how it works: It takes faces you’ve selected and creates edges 
wherever they intersect. You use Intersect with Model in cases where 
you need to create forms that are the union (both put together), dif-
ference (one minus the other), or intersection (the part they have in 
common) of other forms. Figure 4-33 shows what I’m talking about: 
Perhaps I want to make a model that’s a cube with a cylinder-shaped 
chunk taken out of it. I would model the cube and model the cylinder. 
After positioning them carefully, I could then use Intersect with Model 
to create edges where the two shapes’ faces come together. After that, 
I would use the Eraser to get rid of the edges I didn’t want — the rest of 
the cylinder, in this case.
 
✓ Intersect with Model and the Eraser tool go hand in hand. Anytime 
you use Intersect with Model, you need to follow up by spending some 
time deleting the geometry you don’t want. This isn’t a bad thing, but it 
does mean that you need to be good at orbiting, zooming, and panning 
around your model. It also means that you need to be handy with the 
Eraser.

✓ Most of the time, choose to Intersect with Model. This tool has three 
different modes (just introduced in SketchUp 6), but the majority of the 
time, you’ll end up using the basic one. Here’s what all three of them do:
 
• Intersect with Model: Creates edges everywhere your selected 
faces intersect with other faces in your model — whether the other 
faces are selected or not.
 
• Intersect Selected: Only creates edges where selected faces inter-
sect with other selected faces. This is handy if you’re trying to be a 
little bit more precise.
 
• Intersect with Context: This one’s a little trickier: Choosing this 
option creates edges where faces within the same group or compo-
nent intersect; that’s why it’s only available when you’re editing a 
group or component.
 
✓ Intersect with Model doesn’t have a button. To use it, you have to either:
 
• Right-click and choose Intersect with Model.
 
• Choose Edit➪Intersect.
 
Most 3D modeling programs let you do Boolean operations, meaning that you’re 
encouraged to make models by adding, subtracting, and intersecting different 
shapes to make new ones. This makes sense for solids modelers (like SolidWorks, 
Inventor, and Form●Z) because this paradigm is a lot like sculpting with clay. But 
because SketchUp is more paper-like than clay-like (it’s not clay-like at all, come 
to think of it), Boolean operations are not technically possible. Intersect with 
Model is about as close as SketchUp comes to letting you work this way.
Using Intersect with Model to make roofs
When it comes to creating roofs, you can use Intersect with Model to 
combine a whole bunch of gables, hips, dormers, sheds, and so on into a 
single roof. It’s no cakewalk, and it requires a fair amount of planning, but it 
works great when nothing else will.

112
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
Figure 4-34 shows a complicated roof with several different elements. Gabled 
roofs have been pushed/pulled into the main hip roof form at all different 
heights, but edges don’t exist where all the different faces meet. In the steps 
that follow, I use Intersect with Model to create the edges I want and then I use 
the Eraser to clean up my mess:
 
Figure 4-34: 
Here’s a 
typically 
complex 
roof that I 
could use 
Intersect 
with Model 
to unify.
 
Erase from underside stuff that doesn’t belong
 
1. Select the whole roof.
 
 You can select the whole roof a number of ways, but the one that I find 
works the best is to first hide the group that contains the rest of your 
building, and then draw a big selection box around the whole roof with 
the Select tool.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Intersect➪Intersect Selected.
 
 This tells SketchUp to go through and create edges everywhere you 
have faces that intersect — everywhere they pass through each other 
without an edge.
 
3. Get out your Eraser and carefully delete all the extra geometry on the 
inside of your roof.
 
 I won’t lie; this can be a lot of work. But it’s a whole lot easier than using 
the Line tool and SketchUp’s inference engine to figure out where every-
thing should go. The last image in Figure 4-37 shows the end result.
When all else fails, use the Line tool
Fancy tools like Follow Me and Intersect with 
Model are useful most of the time, but for some 
roofs, you just have to resort to drawing good old 
edges. If that’s the case, you’d better get familiar 
with most of the stuff at the beginning of Chapter 
2, because you’re going to be inferencing like 
there’s no tomorrow. SketchUp users who really 
know what they’re doing can draw anything with 
the Line tool and the Eraser too; it’s a beautiful 
thing to watch. Unfortunately, it’s not a beautiful 
thing to write (or read) about in a black-and-white

from first principles” stuff as I’d like.
All the same, check out the following figure. In

I
wish there was a way to use the typography in this book to convey the 
relative importance of certain topics; if there was, the word COMPONENTS 
would be printed 4 inches high, and it would be colored neon green. 
Components are that important.
Making a component (or a group) is like gluing together some of the geom-
etry in your model. Edges and faces that are grouped together act like mini-
models inside your main model; you use components and groups to make 
it easier to select, move, hide, and otherwise work with parts of your model 
that need to be kept separate. Getting used to using groups and components 
is the single biggest thing you can do to get better at SketchUp.
This chapter is about creating and using SketchUp components to make your 
life a whole lot simpler. I begin by talking about groups (which are a little bit 
like lobotomized components). After that, I jump into components — finding 
them, managing them, and making your own. The last part of this chapter 
is brand new for SketchUp 7; it’s all about Dynamic Components, which are 
the best thing to happen to SketchUp since the invention of the scroll-wheel 
mouse.

116
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Grouping Things Together
 
Anyone who’s worked with SketchUp for even a short time has probably 
noticed something: SketchUp geometry (the edges and faces that make up 
your model) is sticky. That is to say, stuff in your model wants to stick to other 
stuff. The people who invented SketchUp built it this way on purpose; the rea-
sons why would take a while to explain. Suffice it to say, making and using 
groups are the keys to keeping the stuff in your model from sticking together.
You have many reasons to make groups; here are a few of them:
 
✓ Grouped geometry doesn’t stick to anything. Perhaps you’ve modeled 
a building, and you want to add a roof. You want to be able to remove 
the roof by moving it out of the way with the Move tool, but every time 
you try, you end up pulling the whole top part of the house along with it 
(like the middle image in Figure 5-1). Making the roof a separate group 
allows you to let it sit on top of your house without sticking there, 
making it easier to deal with, as shown in the right image in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Making the 
roof into 
a group 
means that 
it won’t stick 
to the rest 
of your 
building. 
The house is being stretched
 
✓ Using groups makes it easier to work with your model. You can select 
all the geometry in a group by clicking it once with the Select tool. You 
can move groups around and make copies with the Move tool. To edit 
a group, you double-click it with the Select tool. To stop editing it, you 
click outside it, somewhere else in your modeling window.
 
✓ You can name groups. If you turn a selection of geometry in your model 
into a group, you can give it a name. In the Outliner (which I talk about 
in Chapter 7) you can see a list of the groups (and components) in your 
model, and if you’ve given them names, you can see what you have.

117
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
Follow these steps to create a group:
 
1. Select the geometry (edges and faces) you’d like to turn into a group.
 
 The simplest way to select multiple entities (edges and faces) is to click 
them one at a time with the Select tool while holding down Shift. You 
can also use the Select tool to drag a box around the entities you want 
to select, but this can be tough, depending on where they are. For more 
information on making selections, check out Chapter 2.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Make Group.
 
 You can also right-click and choose Make Group from the context menu 
that pops up.
 
If you want to “ungroup” the geometry in a group, you need to explode it. 
Right-click the group and choose Explode from the context menu. The edges 
and faces that were grouped together aren’t grouped together anymore.
Working with Components
Even though components are incredibly important, there’s nothing too magi-
cal about them — they’re just groupings of geometry (edges and faces) that 
make working in SketchUp faster, easier, and more fun. In a lot of ways, com-
ponents are really just fancy groups — they do a lot of the same things. In 
the following sections, I talk about what makes components special and give 
some examples of what you can do with them. Next, I give a quick tour of the 
Components dialog box, pointing out where components live and how you 
can organize them. The last part of this section is devoted to making your 
own. It’s not hard, and after you can make components, you’ll be on your 
way to SketchUp stardom. (Check out Chapter 11 for more on sharing your 
SketchUp models with the world.)
What makes components so great?
By now, you’ve probably figured out that I’m a big fan of using components 
whenever you can. Here’s why:
 
✓ Everything that’s true about groups is true about components. That’s 
right: Components are just like groups, only better (in some ways, at 
least). Components don’t stick to the rest of your model, you can give 
them meaningful names, and you can select them, move them, copy 
them, and edit them easily — just like you can with groups.

118
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ Components update automatically. When you use multiple copies 
(called instances) of the same component in your model, they’re 
all spookily linked. Changing one makes all of them change, which 
saves loads of time. Consider a window component that I created and 
made two copies of, as shown in Figure 5-2. When I add something (in 
this case, some shutters) to one instance of that component, all the 
instances are updated. Now I have three windows, and they all have 
shutters.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Changing 
one 
instance 
of a com-
ponent 
changes all 
the other 
instances, 
too. 
These windows are instances
of the same component
 
✓ Using components can help you keep track of quantities. You can use 
the Components dialog box to count, select, substitute, and otherwise 
manage all the component instances in your model. Figure 5-3 shows 
a great big (and ugly) building I designed to go with the window com-
ponent I made. I have a lot more control because they’re component 
instances than I would have otherwise.
 
✓ You can make a component cut an opening automatically. Perhaps 
you’ve made a window (which I have) and you’d like that window to 
poke a hole through whatever surface you stick it to (which I do). You 
can set up SketchUp components to cut their own openings in faces. 
These openings are even temporary; when you delete the component, 
the hole disappears. Check out Figure 5-4 to see this in action.
 
 Components that are set up to automatically cut openings can only do 
so through a single face. Even if your wall is two faces thick, your com-
ponents will cut through only one of them.
 
✓ You can use your components in other models. It’s a simple operation 
to make any component you build available for use whenever you’re 
working in SketchUp, no matter what model you’re working on. If you 
have a group of parts or other things you always use, making your own 
component collection can save you a lot of time and effort. There’s more 
information about creating your own component collections later in this 
section.

✓ Components are great for making symmetrical models. Because you 
can flip a component instance and keep working on it, and because com-
ponent instances automatically update when you change one of them, 
using components is a great way to model anything that’s symmetrical. 
And if you look around, you’ll notice that most of the things we use are 
symmetrical. The second-to-last part of this chapter dives headlong into 
modeling symmetrical things like couches and hatchbacks; Figure 5-5 
shows some examples.

Exploring the Components dialog box
 
It’s all fine and well that SketchUp lets you turn bits of your models into 
components, I suppose, but wouldn’t it be nice if you had someplace to keep 
them? And wouldn’t it be great if you could use components made by other 
people to spiff up your model, instead of having to build everything yourself? 
As you’ve probably already guessed, both of these things are possible, and 
both involve the Components dialog box, which you can find on the Window 
menu. It’s been completely overhauled for SketchUp 7.

121
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
Here’s something you need to realize: You can bring any SketchUp model on 
your computer into your current file as a component. That’s because compo-
nents are really just SketchUp files embedded in other SketchUp files. When 
you create a component in your model, you’re effectively creating a new, 
nested SketchUp file. Neat, huh?
The Components dialog box is made up of four major areas, which I describe 
in the following sections.
Info and buttons
I don’t really know what to call this part of the dialog box, so I’ll call it like 
it is: It’s for information and buttons. Figure 5-6 points out its elements, and 
here’s what everything does:
 
✓ Name: The name of the component you select appears here. If it’s a 
component in your model, it’s editable. If it’s in one of the default col-
lections, it’s not. A component is considered to be in your model if it 
appears in your In Model collection, which you can read about in the 
section “The Select pane,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Description: Some, but not all, components have descriptions associ-
ated with them. You can write one when you’re creating a new com-
ponent, or you can add one to an existing component in your model. 
Just like the name, you can only edit descriptions for models in your In 
Model library.
The Google 3D Warehouse
Imagine a place online where everyone in the 
world can share SketchUp models for free. 
That’s the 3D Warehouse in a nutshell. It’s 
hosted by Google, it’s available in over 20 lan-
guages, and it’s searchable — just like you’d 
expect from the world’s most popular search 
engine.
You can get to the 3D Warehouse in a couple of 
different ways:
 ✓ On the Web: Just type http://sketch
up.google.com/3dwarehouse into 
your Web browser.
 ✓ Through SketchUp: New for SketchUp 7, 
the Components dialog box is hooked up 
directly to the 3D Warehouse, as long as 
you’re online. You can also open the 3D 
Warehouse in a separate window by choos-
ing File➪3D Warehouse➪Get Models.
Anything you find on the 3D Warehouse, you 
can download and use in your own models. You 
can also upload anything you make so that other 
people can use it. Find out more about sharing 
your work on the 3D Warehouse in Chapter 11.

✓ Display Secondary Selection Pane button: Clicking this button opens a 
second view of your collections at the bottom of the Components dialog 
box. You use this to manage the components on your computer system.
The Select pane
This is where your components live (if they can be said to live anywhere). 
You use the Select pane to view, organize, and choose components. 
Figure 5-7 shows the Select pane in all its glory.
 
✓ In Model Collection button: SketchUp automatically keeps track of the 
components you’ve used in your model and puts a copy of each of them 
in your In Model collection. Each SketchUp file you create has its own 
In Model collection, which contains the components that exist in that 
model. Clicking the In Model Collection button displays the components 
in your In Model collection, if you have any.
 
✓ Collections List button: The components listed under the Favorites 
heading are a mix of two different collection types:
 
• Local collections are folders of components that live on your hard 
drive. You can access them anytime because they refer to files on 
your computer.
 
• Online collections are groupings of components that live in the 
Google 3D Warehouse (which you can read lots more about in this 
book). Unlike local collections, you can only access online collec-
tions when you’re — you guessed it — online.

 Unfortunately, there’s no way to tell just by looking at them in the list 
which collections are local and which are online. If you click the name 
of a collection and see a Searching Google 3D Warehouse progress bar 
before you see any models, that collection is online.
 
✓ 3D Warehouse Search bar: It works just like regular Google search: 
Type in what you’re looking for and press Enter. Models in the Google 
3D Warehouse that match your search terms appear in the Components 
window below. Naturally, you need to be online for this to work.
 
✓ Components Window: This window displays the components in the cur-
rently selected component collection, or the results of a 3D Warehouse 
search you’ve just performed. Click a component to use it in your model.
 
 Components that have a little green arrow icon next to them are special; 
they’re called Dynamic Components. They’re new in SketchUp 7 and 
they have special abilities. You can read about DCs later in this chapter.
 
✓ View Options button: Pretty simple, really. This is where you decide 
how to view the components (or subcollections) in the Components 
window.
 
✓ Collection Details menu: Here’s where you manage your component 
collections. A bunch of options exist, so I’d better explain what most of 
them mean:

124
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
• Open a local collection: Lets you choose a folder on your com-
puter system to use as a component collection. Any SketchUp 
models in that folder show up in the Components Window, ready 
to be used as components in your models.
 
• Create a new collection: Allows you to create a folder somewhere 
on your computer system that you can use as a component collec-
tion. This is handy if you have a number of components that you use 
all the time; putting them all in one place makes them easier to find.
 
• Save as a local collection: When you choose this option, SketchUp 
lets you save the components that currently appear in your 
Components Window as a brand-new local collection. If the com-
ponents you’re viewing are online, copies of them get downloaded 
to your computer. If you’re viewing your In Model collection, the 
contents get copied and included in a new folder. If you’re already 
viewing a local collection, this option isn’t available.
 
• View in Google 3D Warehouse: If you’re viewing an online collec-
tion, this option opens that collection in a separate window that 
displays the 3D Warehouse in much more detail.
 
• 3D Warehouse Terms of Service: Choose this option if you’re 
having trouble sleeping. If you’re wondering who owns the stuff on 
the 3D Warehouse, this is where it’s at.
 
• Add to Favorites: Choosing this option adds whatever you’re 
viewing in the Components Window to the Favorites section of the 
Collections list. That goes for local collections (folders on your 
computer); online collections (from the 3D Warehouse); and 3D 
Warehouse Searches. That’s right — you can save a search as a 
favorite collection. The models in a Favorite Search collection will 
always be different, depending on what’s in the 3D Warehouse.
 
 The next two options only appear when you’re viewing your In Model 
collection:
 
• Expand: Because components can be made up of other, nested 
components, a component you use in your model might really be 
lots of components. Choosing Expand displays all the components 
in your model, whether or not they’re nested inside other compo-
nents. Most of the time, you’ll probably want to leave Expand dese-
lected.
 
• Purge Unused: Choose this to get rid of any components in your In 
Model collection that aren’t in your model anymore. Be sure to use 
this before you send your SketchUp file to someone else; it’ll seri-
ously reduce your file size and make things a whole lot neater.

125
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
The Edit pane
Because the options in this part of the Components dialog box are similar to 
the ones you get when you make a new component, you should check out the 
section “Creating your own components,” later in this chapter, for the whole 
scoop.
 
You can only use the options in the Edit pane on components in your In Model 
collection — everything is grayed out for components that live in any other 
place.
The Statistics pane
Can you remember who won the 1975 Super Bowl? How many home runs did 
Hank Aaron hit in his career? Do you always check the nutrition information 
panel on food packaging? You might be a sucker for statistics, and if so, wel-
come home. . . .
Select and replace all your troubles away
On top of all the buttons, menus, and windows 
you can immediately see in the Select pane 
of the Components dialog box, some hidden 
options exist that most people don’t find until 
they go looking for them; they’re on the context 
menu that pops up when you right-click an In 
Model collection component:
 ✓ Select Instances: Perhaps you have 15 
instances (copies) of the same component 
in your model, and you want to select them 
all. Just make sure that you’re viewing your 
In Model collection, and then right-click the 
component (in the Components dialog box) 
whose instances you want to select all of. 
Choose Select Instances, and your work’s 
done. This can save you tons of time, par-
ticularly if you have component instances 
all over the place.
 ✓ Replace Selected: Now you might want to 
swap in a different component for one that’s 
in your model. Simply select the component 
instances (in your modeling window) that 
you want to replace, and then right-click 
the component (in the Components dialog 
box) that you want to use instead. Choose 
Replace Selected from the context menu to 
perform the swap.
Ready for an even better tip? Use Select 
Instances and Replace Selected together 
to help you work more efficiently. Instead of 
placing 20 big, heavy tree components in your 
model (which can seriously slow things down), 
use a smaller, simpler component instead (like 
a stick). When you’re finished modeling, use 
Select Instances to select all the stand-in com-
ponents at once, and then use Replace Selected 
to swap in the real component. 

126
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Even if you’re not, the Statistics pane is a useful place to spend some time. 
You use it to keep track of all the details related to whatever component you 
have selected in the Components dialog box. (See Figure 5-8.) This is espe-
cially useful for doing the following things:
 
Figure 5-8: 
The 
Statistics 
pane of the 
Components 
dialog box: 
Geek out on 
numbers.
 
 
✓ Checking the size of your components: The information in the Edges 
and Faces areas of this pane lets you know how much geometry is in a 
component. If you’re worried about file size or your computer’s perfor-
mance, try to use small components — ones with low numbers of faces 
and edges.
 
✓ Seeing what components are inside your components: The Component 
Instances line lists how many component instances are in your selected 
component. If you switch from All Geometry to Components in the drop-
down list at the top of the pane, you can see a list of all the constituent 
components: subcomponents within your main component.
 
The Statistics pane doesn’t show details for components you have selected 
in your actual model; it only shows information about the component that’s 
selected in the Select pane of the Components dialog box. To see information 
about whatever component (or other kind of object) you have selected in 
your modeling window, use the Entity Info dialog box (located in the Window 
menu).
Creating your own components
Now that I’ve got you all jazzed up about the wonder and mystery of using 
components in your models, I’ll bet you can’t wait to start making your own. 
At least I hope so — using components is probably the single best SketchUp 
habit you can develop. Here’s why:

127
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
✓ Components keep file sizes down. When you use several instances of a 
single component, SketchUp only has to remember the information for 
one of them. This means that your files are smaller, which in turn means 
you’ll have an easier time e-mailing, uploading, and opening them on 
your computer.
 
✓ Components show up in the Outliner. If you’re a person who’s at all 
interested in not wasting time hunting around for things you’ve mis-
placed, you should create lots of components. Doing so means that 
you’ll be able to see, hide, unhide, and rearrange them in the Outliner, 
which I go over in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Components can save your sanity. Hooray! You’ve finished a model of 
the new airport — and it only took three weeks! Too bad the planning 
commission wants you to add a sunshade detail to every one of the 
1,300 windows in the project. If you made that window a component, 
you’re golden. If, on the other hand, that window isn’t a component, 
you’re going to be spending a very long night holding hands with your 
computer mouse.
 
✓ Components can be dynamic. New for SketchUp 7, Dynamic 
Components are components with special abilities. They can be set up 
with multiple configurations, taught to scale intelligently, programmed 
to perform simple animations, and more. Anyone can use existing DCs, 
but only people with SketchUp Pro 7 can create new ones. Check out 
“Discovering Dynamic Components” later in this chapter, for the whole 
story.
Making a new component
 
Creating simple components is a pretty easy process, but making more com-
plicated ones — components that automatically cut openings, stick to sur-
faces, and always face the viewer — can be a little trickier. Follow these steps, 
regardless of what kind of component you’re trying to make:
 
1. Select at least two edges and faces you’d like to turn into a 
component.
 
 For more information on making selections, see Chapter 2.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Create Component.
 
 The Create Component dialog box opens. (See Figure 5-9.)
 
3. Give your new component a name and description.
 
 Of these two, the name is by far the most important. Make sure to 
choose one that’s descriptive enough that you’ll understand it when you 
open your model a year from now.

 Wondering what the heck all this stuff means? I don’t blame you — it can 
be a bit confusing the first time. For a quick introduction to each option 
and tips for using it, check out Table 5-1.
 
5. Select the Replace Selection with Component check box, if it isn’t 
already selected.
 
 This drops your new component into your model right where your 
selected geometry was, saving you from having to insert it yourself from 
the Components dialog box.
 
6. Click the Create button to create your new component.

What It Does
Tips and Tricks
Glue To
Makes a component 
automatically stick to a 
specific plane. For example, 
a chair will almost always 
be sitting on a floor. It will 
almost never be stuck to a 
wall, turned sideways. When 
a component is glued to a 
surface, using the Move tool 
only moves it around on that 
surface — never perpen-
dicular to it (up and down, if 
the surface is a floor).
Use this feature for objects 
that you want to remain on the 
surface you put them on, espe-
cially objects you’ll want to 
rearrange: Furniture, windows, 
and doors are prime examples. 
If you want to “unstick” a glued 
component from a particular 
surface, right-click it and 
choose Unglue from the 
context menu.

Axes
Sets a component’s axis 
origin and orientation. This 
is important primarily if you 
have SketchUp Pro 7 and are 
planning to make this into a 
Dynamic Component. If you 
aren’t, you can safely leave 
this alone.
Click the Set Component Axes 
button to choose where you 
want your component’s axis 
origin to be (where the red, 
green, and blue axes meet). 
Click once to center your 
axes, again to establish the

establish the green and blue 
directions. If you’re creating 
a Dynamic Component, this is 
something you absolutely must

moves, too.

Face-Me components (that’s 
what they’re called) work 
right, rotate your component-
to-be so that it’s perpendicular 
to your model’s green axis 
before you choose Make 
Component.
Using flat, lightweight compo-
nents instead of 3D heavy ones 
is a great way to have lots of

You should leave this check box

in two or more separate places, 
as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
Components can only cut through one face at a time. If your model’s walls are 
two faces thick, you’ll have to cut your window and door openings manually.

Making your own doors and windows
If you’re kind of nerdy like I am, nothing beats 
making your own window and door compo-
nents. Here’s what you need to know (check 
out the illustration that follows this sidebar for 
visual instructions):
 1. Start by drawing a rectangle on a vertical 
surface, like a wall.
 2. Delete the face you just created to make a 
hole in your vertical surface.
 3. Select all four edges of the hole you just 
created. Then right-click one of the edges 
and choose Make Component from the 
context menu.

131
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 4. Make sure that Glue to Any, Cut Opening, 
and Replace Selection with Component are 
all selected; then click the Create button to 
create your new component.
 5. With the Select tool, double-click your 
new component (in the modeling window) 
to edit it; the rest of your model will appear 
to fade back a bit.
 6. Use the modeling tools just like you 
always would to keep building your door 
or window any way you want.
 7. When you’re done, click outside your com-
ponent to stop editing it.
If the opening you create ever closes up, one of 
two things probably happened:
 ✓ A new surface was created. Try deleting 
the offending surface to see whether that 
fixes things; it usually does.
 ✓ The cutting boundary was messed up. The 
cutting boundary consists of the edges that 
define the hole your component is cutting. 
If you take away those edges, SketchUp 
doesn’t know where to cut the hole any-
more. Drawing them back in usually sets 
things straight.

132
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Editing, exploding, and locking component instances
Right-clicking a component instance in your modeling window opens a context 
menu that offers lots of useful choices; here’s what some of them let you do:
 
✓ Edit Component: To edit all instances of a component at once, right-
click any instance and choose Edit Component from the context menu. 
The rest of your model will fade back, and you’ll see a dashed bounding 
box around your component. When you’re done, click somewhere out-
side the bounding box to finish editing; your changes have been made in 
every instance of that component in your model.
 
✓ Make Unique: Sometimes you want to make changes to only one or a 
few of the instances of a component in your model. In this case, select 
the instance(s) you want to edit, right-click one of them, and choose 
Make Unique from the context menu. This turns the instances you 
selected into a separate component. Now edit any of them; only those 
instances you made unique will reflect your changes.
 
✓ Explode: When you explode a component instance, you’re effectively 
turning it back into regular ol’ geometry. Explode is a lot like Ungroup in 
other software programs (in SketchUp, you use Explode to disassemble 
both components and groups).
 
✓ Lock: Locking a group or a component instance means that nobody — 
including you — can mess with it until it’s unlocked. You should use this 
on parts of your model you don’t want to change accidentally. To unlock 
something, right-click it and choose Unlock.
Taking Advantage of  Components 
to Build Better Models
The fact is, a huge amount of the stuff in the galaxy is made up of some kind 
of repeated element. In the case of bilaterally symmetrical objects (like most 
furniture), that element is a mirrored half; for things like staircases, it’s a 
step or tread. The whole is composed of two or more instances of a single 
part. This makes modeling a heck of a lot easier, because it means you don’t 
often have to model things in their entirety — especially if you’re using 
components.
The following is a list of reasons why you should work with components 
whenever you’re building an object that’s made up of repeated elements:
 
✓ It’s faster. This one’s obvious. Not having to model the same things 
twice provides you with more time for playing golf or answering e-mail, 
depending on what you prefer to do.

133
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
✓ It’s smarter. Everybody knows that things change, and when they do, 
it’s nice not to have to make the same changes more than once. Using 
component instances means only ever having to do things once.
 
✓ It’s sexy. Modeling something and then watching it repeat in a bunch of 
other places are fun to do, and the overall effect impresses the heck out 
of a crowd. Somehow, people will think you’re smarter if they see things 
appearing “out of nowhere.”
In this section, I describe two methods for modeling with components. The 
first involves symmetrical objects, and it covers about 50 percent of the 
things you might ever want to model. The second technique applies to things 
like stairs and fences, which are both perfect examples of why components 
were invented in the first place.
Modeling symmetrically: Good 
news for lazy people
And smart people, I suppose. First off, take a hard look at the shape of the 
things you might want to model. I want you to think about all the objects in 
the universe. I’ll wait a couple of minutes while you do that. Done so soon? 
Good. Everything in the world (as I’m sure you realized) can be categorized 
as either of the following formal types:
 
✓ Symmetrical: Objects that exhibit bilateral symmetry are made of mir-
rored halves. You’re (more or less) bilaterally symmetrical, and so is 
your car. Another kind of symmetry is radial symmetry; starfish are good 
examples of this, as are umbrellas and apple pies. If you were going to 
build a model of something that exhibits some form of symmetry, build-
ing one part and making copies would be a smarter way to do it.
 
✓ Asymmetrical: Some things — puddles, oak trees, many houses — aren’t 
symmetrical. There’s no real trick to making these things; you just have 
to make some coffee, settle in, and get to work.
You can take advantage of both bilateral and radial symmetry with SketchUp 
components. To do so, you just assemble those components as follows, 
depending on what type of symmetry your object has (also take a look at 
Figure 5-11):
 
✓ Bilateral symmetry: To make a model of something that’s bilaterally 
symmetrical, you just build half, make it into a component, and flip over 
a copy.
 
✓ Radial symmetry: Radially symmetrical objects can be (conceptually, 
anyway) cut into identical wedges that all radiate from a central axis. You 
can use components to model things like car wheels and turrets by build-
ing a single wedge and rotating a bunch of copies around a central point.

Working smarter by only building half
Bilaterally symmetrical forms are everywhere. Most animals you can name, 
the majority of the furniture in your house, your personal helicopter — they 
can all be modeled by building half, creating a component, and flipping over 
a copy.
Follow these steps to get the general idea of how to start building a bilater-
ally symmetrical model in SketchUp (see Figure 5-12):
 
1. Make a simple box.
 
 You can do this however you want, but I think the easiest way is to draw 
a rectangle and push/pull it into 3D.
 
2. Draw a diagonal edge on the corner of your box.
 
 The point of this step is to mark one side of your box so that when you 
flip it over, you don’t get confused about which side is which.
 
3. Turn your box into a component.
 
 Refer to “Creating your own components,” earlier in this chapter, if 
you’re wondering how to do this.

135
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
4. Make a copy of your new component instance.
 
 The last part of Chapter 2 has information about moving and copying 
objects in SketchUp, but here’s a simple version:
 
a. Choose the Move tool.
 
b. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to toggle from Move to Copy mode. 
You should see a little plus sign (+) next to your cursor.
 
c. Click your component instance.
 
d. Move your copy over beside the original, and click again to drop it. 
Make sure that you move in either the red or the green direction; it 
makes things easier in the next step.
 
5. Flip the copy over.
 
 To do this, right-click the copy and choose Flip Along from the context 
menu. If you moved your copy in the red direction in the previous step, 
choose Flip Along➪Component’s Red. Choose Component’s Green if you 
moved in the green direction.
 
6. Stick the two halves back together.
 
 Using the Move tool (this time without Copy toggled on), pick up your 
copy from the corner and move it over, dropping it on the corresponding 
corner of the original. Take a look at the last image in Figure 5-12 to see 
what I mean. Doing this precisely is important, if you want your model to 
look right.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Now you’re set up to start building symmetrically. If you want, you can do a 
test to make sure things went smoothly (see Figure 5-13). Follow these steps:
 
1. With the Select tool, double-click one of the halves of your model to 
edit it.
 
2. Draw a circle on the top surface and push/pull it into a cylinder.
If the same thing happens on the other side, you’re good to go. If the same 
thing doesn’t happen on the other side, it’s possible that:
 
✓ You’re not really editing one of your component instances. If you 
aren’t, you’re drawing on top of your component instead of in it. You’ll 
know you’re in Component Edit mode if the rest of your model looks 
grayed out.
 
✓ You never made a component in the first place. If your halves don’t 
have blue boxes around them when you select them, they’re not compo-
nent instances. Start a new file and try again, paying particular attention 
to Step 3 in the preceding steps.
  
Whatever you do on this
side should happen on the
other side, too

The coolest things since radially sliced bread
You can model objects that exhibit radial symmetry just as easily as those 
with bilateral symmetry; you just start out slightly differently. The only thing 
you have to decide before you start is how many wedges — how many identi-
cal parts — your object is made of.
To set yourself up to model something with radial symmetry, you start by 
modeling one wedge, then you make it into a component, and then you rotate 
copies around the center. Follow these steps to get the hang of it yourself:
 
1. Draw a polygon with as many sides as the number of segments you 
need for the object you’re modeling.
Making two halves look like one whole
Looking carefully at the little boat in the figure 
that follows, notice how the edges in the middle 
clearly show that it’s made out of two halves? 
If I were to erase those edges, my whole model 
would disappear, because those edges are 
defining faces, and without edges, faces can’t 
exist.
Instead of erasing those unwanted edges, I can 
hide them by using the Eraser while pressing 
Shift. See the second and third images of the 
boat? When I hold down Shift as I drag over the 
edges I want to hide with the Eraser, they disap-
pear. Two things are important to know about 
hidden edges:
 ✓ Hidden edges aren’t gone forever. Actually, 
this applies to any hidden geometry in your 
model. To see what’s hidden, choose 
View➪Hidden Geometry. To hide it again, 
just choose the same thing.
 ✓ To edit hidden edges, you have to make 
them visible. If you need to make changes 
to your model that involve edges you’ve 
already hidden, you can either view 
your hidden geometry (see the previous 
point) or unhide them altogether. Just 
show your hidden geometry, select the 
edges you want to unhide, and choose 
Edit➪Unhide➪Selected.
Distracting edges
Use Eraser to hide

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
 Here’s the easiest way to draw a polygon in SketchUp, as shown in 
Figure 5-14:
 
a. Choose Tools➪Polygon to select the Polygon tool.
 
b. Click once to establish the center (I like to do this on the axis 
origin), move your cursor, and then click again to establish the 
radius. Don’t worry about being accurate right now.
 
c. Before you do anything else, type in the number of sides you’d like 
your polygon to have and press Enter.

polygon to 
start, draw 
two edges 
to create a 
wedge, and 
erase the 
rest of your 
polygon.

Define a wedge
Erase the rest
 
2. Draw edges from the center of your polygon to two adjacent vertices 
(endpoints) on the perimeter, creating a wedge.
 
 To find the center of a polygon (or a circle), hover your cursor over the 
outline for a couple of seconds and move the cursor toward the middle; 
a center inference point should appear.
 
3. Erase the rest of your polygon, leaving only the wedge.
 
4. Turn your wedge into a component.
 
 Check out “Making your own components,” earlier in this chapter, if 
you’re unsure of how to do this.
 
5. Make copies of your wedge component instance with the Rotate tool 
(see Figure 5-15).
 
 Just like with the Move tool, you can use the Rotate tool to make copies. 
You can even make an array (more than one copy at a time). Here’s how 
to do it:
 
a. Select your wedge’s edges (sorry — I just wanted to say that). 
Select the face, too.
 
b. Choose Tools➪Rotate to select the Rotate tool.

139
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
c. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to tell SketchUp you want to make a 
copy; a + should appear next to your cursor.
 
d. Click the pointy end of your wedge to set your center of rotation.
 
e. Click one of the opposite corners of your wedge to set your rota-
tion start point.
 
f. Click the other corner to make a rotated copy of your wedge.
 
g. Before you do anything else, type in the number of additional 
wedges you want, followed by the letter x, and then press Enter.
 
6. Test your setup, if you want.
 
 Follow the steps at the end of the previous section in this chapter to test 
things out.
 
Hiding the edges in your component instances makes your finished model 
look a whole lot better. Take a look at the sidebar “Making two halves look like 
one whole,” earlier in this chapter, to read how.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Modeling with repeated elements
A staircase is a perfect example of an object that’s composed of several iden-
tical elements. If, when you hear the phrase “several identical elements,” a 
big, flashing neon sign that screams “COMPONENTS!” doesn’t appear in your 
head, you’re not using SketchUp enough. On the other hand, maybe there’s 
something wrong with me. . . .
In the following example, I’m trying to kill two birds with one stone: I’m using 
it to demonstrate how you might use components to model more efficiently, 
and I’m using it to show readers of Chapter 4 the smartest way to build a set 
of stairs.
The Treads Are Components method involves (you guessed it) making 
each tread (step) in your staircase into an instance of the same component. 
Basically, you build one simple tread that’s the right depth, make it into a 
component, and copy a bunch of instances into a full flight of stairs. Because 
every step is linked, anything you do to one automatically happens to all of 
them. If you don’t know the first thing about components, now would be a 
terrific time to start from the beginning of this very chapter.
 
Go through these steps to build a staircase using the Treads Are Components 
method:
 
1. Model a single step, including the tread and the riser.
 
 You can make this very simple at this stage, if you want to; all that mat-
ters is that the tread depth and the riser height are correct. You can fiddle 
with everything else later. Figure 5-16 shows a simple example of this.
 
Figure 5-16: 
Model a 
single step, 
making sure 
that the 
depth and 
height are 
accurate.
 
 
2. Make a component out of the step you just built.
 
 Take a look at “Making your own components,” earlier in this chapter, if 
you need help.

141
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
3. Move a copy of your step into position, above the first one (see 
Figure 5-17).
 
4. Type in the total number of steps you want, type an x, and then press 
Enter.
 
 You’re creating a linear array, meaning that you’re making several 
copies at regular intervals, in the same direction you moved the first 
one. Typing 12x generates 12 steps the same distance apart as the first 
step and its copy. The last image on the right in Figure 5-17 shows what I 
mean.
 
5. With the Select tool, double-click any one of your steps to edit all 
instances of your component.
 
 Everything besides the component instance you’re editing should fade 
out a little.
 
6. Go nuts.
 
 This really is the fun part. Having your staircase made up of multiple 
component instances means that you have all the flexibility to make 
drastic changes to the whole thing without ever having to repeat your-
self. Add a nosing (a bump at the leading edge of each tread), a stringer 
(a diagonal piece of structure that supports all your steps), or even a 
handrail by getting creative with how you modify a single component 
instance. Figure 5-18 shows some of what you can do. The color insert in 
this book shows the Treads Are Components method applied to building 
a circular stair.

Discovering Dynamic Components
 
Once upon a time, the smartest thing a component could do was cut its own 
hole in a surface. “Wow!” all of us SketchUp aficionados thought, “Components 
are geniuses!” And so they were — until SketchUp 7 came along. With the 
latest release, the folks at Google have introduced an entirely new dimension 
to modeling with SketchUp: Dynamic Components are components with spe-
cial powers.
Until version 7, SketchUp components were basically dumb. If you wanted to 
make a staircase longer, you had to make copies of the steps and place them 
in the right spot. If you needed to change the color of a car, you had to dig 
out the Paint Bucket and dive into the geometry. The problem was that com-
ponents didn’t know what they were supposed to represent; they were just 
groupings of faces and edges in the shape of an object.
Dynamic Components (DCs) are models that have an idea of what they are; 
they know what to do when you interact with them. This section outlines 
what DCs represent for SketchUp modelers, how to use them, and how to go 
about creating your own.
Getting acquainted with DCs
There’s a lot to cover, so dive right in. Here’s what you need to know about 
Dynamic Components:
 
✓ DCs are just like regular components, but with extra information 
added. That extra information makes them easier to deal with than 
other components, because they know how they’re supposed to behave 
when you need to use them. More on that later.

143
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
✓ They can do all sorts of things. Describing what DCs do is tricky 
because they’re all different. The simple (but totally unsatisfying) 
answer is that they do what they’ve been programmed to do. I think 
some examples are in order (see Figure 5-19):
 
• A dynamic door component might be set up to swing open when 
you click it with the Interact tool.
 
• The same dynamic door might also be configured into different 
sizes, styles, and finishes by using simple drop-down menus in the 
Component Options dialog box.
 
• A dynamic stair component might automatically add or remove 
steps as you use the Scale tool to make it taller or shorter.
 
Figure 5-19: 
Dynamic 
Components 
can do all 
kinds of 
things.
 

144
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
• A dynamic chair might be scaled into a sofa, but without stretching 
the arms — it would also add cushions as you make it longer.
 
• Sang (the little dude who shows up by default when you start a 
new SketchUp file) is also dynamic: click his shirt with the Interact 
tool to cycle through the Google colors.
 
✓ Anyone can use DCs. Both the free and Pro versions of SketchUp 7 can 
read and use Dynamic Components. The SketchUp team invented them 
(at least partially) to make SketchUp easier for new modelers to pick up.
 
✓ You need Pro to make your own DCs. If you need to build your own 
Dynamic Components (or modify ones that other folks have made), you 
need a copy of SketchUp Pro 7. If you’d like, you can download a free trial 
of Pro from the SketchUp Web site: http://sketchup.google.com.
 
✓ DCs are free. People are adding new DCs to the Google 3D Warehouse 
every day. As you can imagine, companies that make things like furni-
ture and building products (windows, kitchen cabinets, flooring) are 
really excited about the possibilities that Dynamic Components offer. 
Many of them are in the process of producing DCs of everything in their 
catalogues and posting them to the 3D Warehouse. That’s good news for 
us; soon you can download and use a configurable model of almost any-
thing you need.
 
✓ They’re in the 3D Warehouse. When you download SketchUp, you find 
a few sample DCs in the Components dialog box. They’re the ones with 
the little, green dynamic icon next to them (that looks kind of like an 
arrow). The best way to get more is to visit the 3D Warehouse and do a 
special search:
 
1. Choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Get Models to open a window into 
the 3D Warehouse from inside SketchUp.
 
2. Add the following parameter to any search for models you do: 
:isdynamic. For example, if you were looking for a dynamic door, 
you’d search for door :isdynamic. You can also just search for 
is:dynamic to find all of the DCs in the 3D Warehouse.
Using Dynamic Components
In SketchUp 7, you can interact with Dynamic Components in three basic 
ways. Depending on what it’s been set up to do, a particular DC might 
respond to one, two, or all three of the following interactions.
Smart Scaling
DCs designed to react intelligently to the Scale tool are the closest thing to 
true magic that SketchUp offers. Instead of stretching and getting all dis-
torted when you scale them, the parts that are supposed to change dimen-
sions, do; the other parts don’t.

145
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
Take a look at Figure 5-20. The first image shows what happens when I scale 
a non-dynamic window component to make it wider. See how the frame 
stretches? Yuck. The image on the bottom shows the dynamic version of 
the same window. It gets wider when I scale it, but the frame stays the same 
thickness. It’s smart enough to know that only some parts of it should get 
wider when I scale it.
There’s another way that DCs can scale smartly: by adding or subtracting 
pieces as they get bigger or smaller. Dynamic stairs are a perfect example of 
this, as you can see in Figure 5-21. When I use the Scale tool to make it taller, 
the staircase adds steps instead of stretching.

You can turn on the Dynamic Component toolbar, which is a quicker way to 
work with DCs than constantly using the menu bar. Just choose View➪
Toolbars➪Dynamic Components, and you’re all set.
Component Options
Version 7 added the Component Options dialog box, which is on the Window 
menu. You can configure DCs that have been hooked up to this dialog box by 
choosing options from drop-down lists, typing in dimensions, and performing 
other simple tasks. When you change a setting in Component Options, the 
DC you’ve selected updates to reflect the change. It’s kind of like modeling by 
remote control.

147
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
The Component Options dialog box looks different for every DC. 
The first image in Figure 5-22 shows the Component Options dialog box for a 
simple, straight staircase I built. I set it up so you can choose a riser height 
and a tread depth from preprogrammed lists. The dialog box also displays 
the total height (rise), total length (run), and number of steps in the staircase 
as it currently appears.
The second image in Figure 5-22 shows the Component Options for a circular-
stair DC. I wanted to provide a lot of configuration options, so it looks a lot 
different. The dialog box lets you enter a size, structure type, and other infor-
mation, then redraws the staircase based on your specifications.

ent for every

The Interact tool
The Interact tool is another all-new thing in SketchUp 7. Activate the Interact 
tool by choosing it from the Tools menu. Using it couldn’t be simpler: When 
a DC is set up to react to the Interact tool, it does stuff when you click it. Its 
actions depend on what you’ve programmed it to do.

149
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
Check out the truck in Figure 5-23. It’s been designed to react to the Interact 
tool in a few different ways:
 
✓ Clicking the back of the truck cycles through the following options: box, 
flatbed, or flatbed with rails.
 
✓ Clicking the front wheels turns them from side to side.
 
✓ Clicking the doors makes them open and close.
 
When you’re hovering over a DC that’s been connected to the Interact tool, 
your cursor (it was originally called the Magic Finger) gets a little yellow glow 
at the end of it.
Poking around to see what happens
You can’t know which interactions you can use with any particular Dynamic 
Component just by looking at it. If you know you’re dealing with a DC, the 
best way to figure out what it does is to experiment:
 
✓ Select it and open Component Options to see if there’s anything there.
 
✓ Get the Interact tool and hover over it to see if a glow appears at the end 
of your cursor.
 
✓ Get the Scale tool and click it to show its scale grips (little green boxes). 
If any show up, grab one and scale to see what happens. If none show 
up, your DC can’t be scaled with the Scale tool.
 
You should know that groups can be dynamic, too. Deep down in the dark 
recesses of SketchUp’s programming, groups and components are pretty much 
the same thing — groups are just components that behave differently. This 
means that it’s possible to have a group that’s been assigned dynamic abilities. 
What does it matter to you? Not much, but I thought I’d point it out. It’s good 
to know, especially if you plan to build your own DCs with SketchUp Pro.
Building your own Dynamic Components
Keeping in mind that this topic could easily occupy the remainder of this 
book if I let it, making your own Dynamic Components really is easier than 
it sounds. If you’ve been reading the rest of this section, you’ve probably 
noticed that I use the word programmed a lot in conjunction with DCs; I 
shouldn’t. DC creation has nothing to do with programming at all, and you 
certainly don’t need to be a programmer to do it — goodness knows I’m not.
 
You need SketchUp Pro 7 to create new Dynamic Components.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
Based on the limited amount of time I (and everyone else) have been making 
my own DCs, here are the things I think it’s most important to know before 
you get started:
 
✓ It’s based on spreadsheets. If you’re familiar with using formulas and 
simple functions in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Docs, you’ll 
catch on right away. It also helps to remember a little bit of algebra. If 
you’re frowning right now, I’m afraid you might be in for a bit of a bumpy 
ride. There’s no getting around it: Creating Dynamic Components is way 
more technical than anything else you’ll ever do in SketchUp.
 
✓ You need to be very familiar with groups and components. When 
you’re building a DC that has many different parts, you build each of 
those parts as a separate component. Many DCs end up being made 
of complicated hierarchies of components nested inside other compo-
nents, which are in turn nested inside other components. If you haven’t 
already done so, take the time to read this chapter from the beginning — 
it’s a start.
 
✓ You need to know about Component Axes. Because a SketchUp com-
ponent is actually a mini-model inside your main model, it has its own 
set of red, green, and blue axes. If you double-click any component with 
Select, you’ll see what I mean.
 
 Here’s where it gets interesting: Every single one of the dimensions or 
spatial positions you specify when you’re building a DC refers to the 
Component Axes of the components you’re working on. When it comes 
to making DCs, it’s all about knowing where each component’s axes are, 
and being very comfortable with repositioning them when you have to. 
Have a look at the sidebar “Getting to know your components’ axes” for 
more about this.
 
✓ Colors are now letters. Until now, you’ve been able to get away 
with thinking about SketchUp’s three directional axes in terms of 
colors; they’re just red, green, and blue. When it comes to Dynamic 
Components, things get a little bit more complicated. This is what you 
need to know: X is red, Y is green, and Z is blue. 
Coping with Component Attributes
 
First, a word of warning: This section is technical and boring and won’t mean 
much to you until you’ve gotten a little further with DCs. It’s a little bit like 
reading the owner’s manual for a car before you get behind the wheel — infor-
mative but essentially meaningless. This section is here because it contains 
information you’ll need sooner than later, and because it’s too long to be a 
sidebar. 
 
I strongly suggest skipping to the following DC example sections and coming 
back when you feel like it. Now that that’s out of the way . . . 

151
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
Building Dynamic Components is all about setting up rules and relationships 
for the different parts of your model. Each piece of information about your 
DC — dimensions, colors, angles, copies, visibility — is a discrete value 
called an attribute. Which attributes your DC has depends entirely on what 
you want it to do.
In SketchUp Pro 7, you manage all of your components’ attributes in a new 
dialog box called Component Attributes. Choose Window➪Component 
Attributes from the menu bar to open it up. Figure 5-24 shows what it looks 
like for a semi-simple dynamic staircase.
It’s set up like a spreadsheet — like a series of spreadsheets, actually. 
There’s one for each component and subcomponent in your DC, and they’re 
indented so you can see what’s nested inside what. The staircase example in 
this sidebar includes three children, or subcomponents: Tread, Backstop, and 
Stringer.
Getting to know your components’ axes
Every SketchUp component — dynamic or oth-
erwise — has its own set of red, green, and blue 
axes. To build your own Dynamic Components, 
you always need to know exactly where each 
component’s axes are. Moreover, you need to 
be able to relocate them when necessary; as 
you get into authoring DCs, it becomes second 
nature. Component Axes are as integral to DCs 
as the Push/Pull tool is to regular SketchUp 
modeling.
To see a component’s axes, double-click it with 
the Select tool (as if you’re planning to edit it). 
The axes are in the corner of the component by 
default, but you can place them wherever you 
like. You can do this in two ways:
 ✓ When you’re creating the component. The 
Create Component dialog box has a button 
labeled Set Component Axes. Clicking it lets 
you position your new component’s axes 
anywhere you like. As you get familiar with 
DCs, you develop a good sense of where 
they should go, right from the start. Until 
then, there’s always . . . 
 ✓ Anytime after that. Right-click the compo-
nent and choose Change Axes. When you 
do, your cursor turns into a set of axes. 
Click to place the origin (where the three 
colors meet), click again to orient the red 
direction, and again to indicate which way 
is up.
I know what you’re thinking: Where am I sup-
posed to put them? The answer, unfortunately, 
isn’t simple. It all depends on what you’re build-
ing and how you’re building it. For right now, 
simply knowing that your component has its 
own axes and that you control where they are is 
the first step in understanding how DCs work.

The Component Attributes dialog box only shows two levels of hierarchy 
at a time. If you have more than two levels of nesting in your DC, drill down 
into your component (by double-clicking it with the Select tool) to make the 
deeper levels appear in Component Attributes.
Each row in the dialog box is a single attribute. The name of the attribute is 
in the cell on the left, and the value is in the cell on the right. Some attributes 
are very simple (StringerHeight), some are formulas that calculate values 
based on other attributes (RiserActual), and some include scary-looking 
functions (StepNumber). You can switch between viewing formulas and 
the values they produce by clicking the Toggle Formula View button in the 
upper-right corner of the dialog box.

153
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
If you’re used to working with spreadsheets, this should be familiar territory. 
These tips are for creating and editing attributes:
 
✓ Add an attribute by clicking the + icon in the last row of your compo-
nent. When you do, a list of pre-made attributes pops up. Click one to 
add it, or type in a name to create a custom attribute.
 
✓ Edit the name of an attribute by double-clicking it. Keep your attri-
bute names short but meaningful. Use underscoring (Like_This) or 
CamelCase (LikeThis) instead of spaces.
 
✓ Edit the value of an attribute by clicking its cell. When you’re finished 
editing, press Enter to register the change. If you don’t, your edit won’t 
take.
 
✓ Grayed-out values are just there. See how the value of LenZ in the com-
ponent Staircase is lighter than most of the others? That means that it’s 
a current value; it’s not a value I specified. It just happens to be the cur-
rent value of that attribute.
 
✓ Use = to constrain an attribute. When you type an equal sign (=) before 
anything you enter for an attribute, you’re telling SketchUp that what 
comes after is a rule; it constrains that attribute. If I make a box and type 
6 for the length, 8 for the width, and =12 for the height, I’ve made a rule 
that no matter how I scale the box, it will always snap back to being 12 
inches high. Typing a value without an = simply sets that value until it 
changes. Using an = tells SketchUp to preserve that value at all costs.
 
✓ Since formulas and functions are basically constraints, use an = before 
them, too. Just like in other spreadsheets.
 
✓ To reference another attribute, click it. When you’re entering a for-
mula, you don’t have to type the names of other attributes you want to 
use; you can click them to add them automatically. It’s faster and makes 
for more accurate formulas.
 
✓ The ! indicates a referenced attribute from another component. In 
the child component Tread, the attribute LenY is defined as =Staircase!
TreadDepth. The exclamation point (!) means you’re looking at the 
attribute TreadDepth from the parent component Staircase.
 
✓ Attributes appear in alphabetical order. No matter what order you 
add them in, your attributes always arrange themselves in alphabetical 
order — in Component Attributes and in the Component Options dialog 
box. To make them appear the way you want, try adding a prefix (like 
A_ and B_) to your attributes’ names.

154
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
When SketchUp is calculating values for the formulas in a DC, SketchUp 
always starts at the first formula in the top-level component and works down 
from there. When it gets to the bottom (the last formula in the lowest-level 
nested component in your DC), it redraws the model. This means that values 
that are calculated later in the process have no effect on formulas earlier in 
the process. You need to keep this in mind when you’re planning complicated 
DCs with lots and lots of formulas.
Damn the torpedoes: Smart Scaling
I think the best way to get started with Dynamic Components is to dive right 
in and look at an example. Writing about stuff like this in the abstract makes 
my brain sore. I assume you feel the same way.
Here’s a fairly (but not entirely) simple one: The first image in Figure 5-25 is 
a table that I’ve made dynamic; I can use the Scale tool to make it longer or 
wider but not taller. When I scale it, the legs don’t get distorted — they stay 
the same size. I can use the Component Options dialog box to choose table 
height, leg thickness, and tabletop thickness. I can also use the Interact tool 
to cycle through three different color choices.
 
Figure 5-25: 
This table 
component 
is made 
up of five 
subcompo-
nents, each 
with its own 
Component 
Axes.
 Main component axis origin

155
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
Look at how the table’s put together. The second image in Figure 5-25 shows 
that it has five parts, all of which are individual components nested inside 
the main component called Table, for a total of six components:
 
✓ Table
 
• TableTop
 
• TableLeg1
 
• TableLeg2
 
• TableLeg3
 
• TableLeg4
Next, pay attention to where I’ve positioned the Component Axes for each 
part. (Take a look at the sidebar “Getting to know your components’ axes” if 
you’re wondering what’s going on.) The third image in Figure 5-25 shows the 
location of the axes for each of the six components. I placed the axes for each 
leg at the outside corners of the table so that scaling the table also reposi-
tions the legs.
Now take a look at the Component Attributes dialog box for the component 
Table; see Figure 5-26. Component Attributes is the spreadsheet-like interface 
where you put in all your formulas, and it’s available on the Window menu. 
Refer to the section “Coping with Component Attributes,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for details. Notice the following:
 
✓ Subcomponents are indented under their parent component. In this 
case, the four TableLegs and TableTop are children of the main compo-
nent Table.
 
✓ Each component is collapsible. Clicking the little triangles next to each 
component reveals and hides the rows (called attributes) associated with 
that component. Right now, only Table, TableLeg1, and TableTop are 
expanded. The formulas in TableLeg2, 3, and 4 are identical to the ones 
in TableLeg1, so I didn’t show them in the image.
 
✓ Table has a total of six visible attributes. Here’s what each of them 
does:
 
• LenZ: Short for “Length in the Z direction,” it determines the over-
all height of Table. The Z direction is the same as the blue direc-
tion. While I’m at it, X is red and Y is green.
 
• Material: Determines the material (in this case, the color) of Table. 
This attribute’s value is set by the formula in the OnClick attribute, 
which I cover in a moment.

• ScaleTool: Determines which scale grips appear when Table is 
scaled. “Some scale handles hidden” refers to the fact that I’ve 
decided to hide all but the X (red) and Y (green) direction scale 
grips, so that Table can only be scaled wider and longer. I clicked 
the Details button (on the right side of the row) to set which grips 
should be visible.
 
• OnClick: Determines what happens when someone clicks Table 
with the Interact tool. Here, I’ve used the Set() function to tell it 
to cycle through three colors. When it’s clicked, it sets the attri-
bute Material to one of the three values listed in the function: red, 
green, or white.
 
 To learn more about the DC-building functions, click the More 
button at the top of the Component Attributes dialog box. I’m 
afraid I just don’t have enough space to go into any detail about 
them in this book.

157
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
• Leg: Determines the thickness of each TableLeg.
 
• Top: Determines the thickness of TableTop.
 
✓ TableLeg1 has three visible attributes. They’re very similar, actually:
 
• LenX: Short for “Length in the X direction,” it determines the 
dimension of TableLeg in the X (red) direction. The value of 
this attribute is equal to the value of the attribute Leg in Table: 
=Table!Leg.
 
• LenY: Short for “Length in the Y direction,” it determines the 
dimension of TableLeg in the Y (green) direction.
 
• LenZ: Short for “Length in the Z direction,” it determines the 
dimension of TableLeg in the Z (blue) direction. The value of this 
attribute is equal to the difference between the overall table height 
and the thickness of the tabletop: =Table!LenZ-Table!Top.
 
✓ TableTop has only one visible attribute. “LenZ,” in this case, deter-
mines the dimension of TableTop in the Z (blue) direction. Its value is 
equal to the value of the attribute Top in Table: =Table!Top.
Having fun yet? Don’t worry — it gets easier the more you do it. Look at 
one more aspect of the way I set up this DC: the way it’s connected to the 
Component Options dialog box.
Take another look at Figure 5-26; see the little Details button next to the LenZ, 
Leg, and Top attributes in Table? Clicking that button opens a special part of 
the Component Attributes dialog box. There you can decide if — and how — 
that attribute should be visible in the Component Options dialog box. 
Figure 5-27 shows the Component Options dialog box for Table, as well as 
the settings in Component Attributes that make those options available.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Moving right along: Smart Replication
 
Here’s another example: The bookcase in Figure 5-28 is a Dynamic Component 
that automatically adds shelves as you use the Scale tool to make it taller. 
When you scale is shorter, it removes shelves. This DC is an example of a 
behavior I like to call smart replication, meaning that it adds (or removes) 
copies of a particular part as it changes size. As you can imagine, things like 
stairways and fences also benefit from this kind of setup.
Pass those attributes up the chain
For an attribute (SketchUp sometimes calls 
them options) to show up in the Component 
Options dialog box, it has to be associated with 
the parent (main) component of a Dynamic 
Component. In other words, if you want to be 
able to set an attribute from the Component 
Options dialog box, make sure it’s in the top 
level of your DC.
If your DC has multiple layers of nested compo-
nents, and you want to show an option associ-
ated with one that’s buried a few layers deep, 
you need to create attributes in each parent 
component to create what I like to call an attri-
bute chain. It’s a little bit messy, but c’est la 
vie. Take a look at the following diagram to see 
what I’m talking about.
 

159
 Chapter 5: Falling in Love with Components
 
The key to making DCs that replicate automatically is to use the Copies attri-
bute (which I describe at the end of this section, oddly enough). It takes most 
new DC-makers a couple of tries to figure out Copies, so don’t get discouraged. 
This stuff isn’t rocket science, but it isn’t exactly finger painting, either.
The images in Figure 5-28 show three things:
 
✓ The effect of using the Scale tool on the bookcase. Notice that I’ve set 
up this DC to only be able to scale in the blue (height) and red (width) 
directions.
 
✓ The subcomponents in the DC. The hierarchy of this Dynamic 
Component is very simple. The parent (main) component is called 
Bookcase, and it contains three children (subcomponents):
 
• Right: The right-hand vertical support.
 
• Left: The left-hand vertical support.
 
• Shelf: Even though the bookcase currently has four shelves, this 
DC actually only has one Shelf component in it. The other three 
are copies that have been generated based on the bookshelf’s 
total height.

cally adds

Main component axis origin

160
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ The Component Axes of each component. As always, where you locate 
the axes for your DCs (and their children) is the single biggest factor in 
determining how complicated your formulas will be. Take a look at the 
sidebar “Getting to know your components’ axes” for advice.
 
 Here’s why I located my components’ axes where I did:
 
• Bookcase: The axis origin is right smack dab in the middle, along 
the bottom edge of the front of the component. I put it there 
because Bookcase is symmetrical; it’s the same on both sides. If I 
ever need to add parts that are equidistant (equally far) from the 
center of the bookcase, specifying their locations (by means of for-
mulas) is a lot easier — one is just the negative of the other.
 
• Right and Left: Their axes are positioned on the outside edges of 
the bookcase so that scaling Bookcase to change its width will also 
move Right and Left. If I hadn’t done this, I’d be forced to use a 
formula to tell each of them where to be, relative to the rest of the 
component. It’s all about making things simpler while retaining the 
flexibility to make changes later.
 
• Shelf: Just like its parent component Bookcase, the axis origin for 
this component is in the center. Putting it there makes it easy to 
specify its location relative to the rest of the component.
Figure 5-29 is an image of the Component Attributes dialog box for Bookcase. 
Here’s a brief rundown on the attributes (remember those?) for each of the 
four components:
 
✓ Bookcase has four visible attributes:
 
• ScaleTool: Clicking the Details button on the right of the row lets 
you specify how this component is allowed to be scaled.
 
• Shelf: The thickness of each shelf, in inches.
 
• Sides: The thickness of the side pieces, in inches.
 
• Spacing: The center-to-center spacing between shelves.
 
✓ Left and Right have only one visible attribute each. It’s LenX, and it 
determines the thickness of the side pieces. Its value is equal to the 
value of Sides, in Bookcase. Having these two subcomponents refer to 
an attribute in their parent component makes changing them easier; it’s 
one place instead of two.
 
✓ Shelf has five visible attributes:
 
• X: Determines the location of the axis origin of Shelf relative to the 
axis origin of Bookcase, along the X (red) axis. Because I centered 
the axes on each component when I set things up, I can make this 
value 0. Effectively, the center of each shelf should be 0 inches 
from the center of the bookcase.

How many copies of Shelf
to draw
The position along the 
parent component’s Y axis
The size of the upright

• Z: Determines the location of the axis origin of Shelf relative to the 
axis origin of Bookcase, along the Z (blue) axis. Basically, it deter-
mines the height of each shelf by multiplying two values together: 
the shelf spacing (Spacing in Bookcase) and the copy number of 
the shelf.
 
 Here’s where it gets interesting. There are four shelves in 
Bookcase, but only one component called Shelf, right? That’s 
because the other three (the top three, in this case) are copies of 
the first one. Take a look at my description of the Copies attribute, 
a couple of paragraphs from now, to get the rest of the story.
 
 The word copy in this formula (Z=copy*Bookcase!Spacing) tells 
SketchUp to use the copy number of the shelf it’s trying to posi-
tion. If it’s drawing the third shelf, it uses the copy number 2 
(because it’s the second copy) to do the calculation. If the shelf 
spacing is 8 inches, then the third shelf is 8 x 2 inches high.

162
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
• LenX: Determines the dimension of Shelf in the X (red) direction. 
This attribute’s formula takes the overall width of Bookcase and 
subtracts the thickness of the two side pieces.
 
• LenZ: Determines the dimension of Shelf in the Z (blue) direction — 
its thickness. According to this attribute’s simple formula, its value 
is equal to the value of Shelf in Bookcase. By referring to an attribute 
in the parent component (Bookcase), you can expose its value in the 
Component Options dialog box. That way, it’s easier for anyone to 
edit. Take a look at the “Pass those attributes up the chain” sidebar 
to find out more about this.
 
• Copies: Determines how many copies of this component will be 
created. Take a look at the formula: I told it to decide how 
many shelves to draw by taking the overall height of Bookcase 
(Bookcase!LenZ), subtracting the thickness of a single 
shelf (Bookcase!Shelf), and dividing by the shelf spacing 
(Bookcase!Spacing).
 
The attribute Copies automatically rounds down to the nearest whole number, 
which is why I don’t have to worry about SketchUp trying to draw a fraction of 
a shelf. When you’re building your own smart-replication DCs, you sometimes 
need to specify the number of shelves in another attribute. In that case, take a 
look at the ROUND, FLOOR, and CEILING functions listed in the drop-down 
menu at the top of the Component Attributes dialog box.
Just for good measure: Rotation and Animation
 
It might not be the most useful thing you can design Dynamic Components to 
do, but it sure is satisfying. Making your models come to life is actually easier 
than making them scale intelligently, which is good news all around.
Look at Figure 5-30: It’s a simple two-door cabinet that I made into a DC. 
When I click one of the doors with the Interact tool, it swings open. When I 
click it again, it swings shut. Couldn’t be simpler. Pay special attention to the 
third image in Figure 5-30; it shows where I placed the Component Axes for 
the cabinet door on the right. They’re where the hinge would be if there was 
one. The door swings about (around) the Z (blue) axis.
Figure 5-31 shows the Component Attributes dialog box for Cabinet. I’ve 
hidden the sections for all but the two doors, DoorR and DoorL — they’re the 
only ones that matter for this example.
Here’s some detail about the two visible attributes for each door:
 
✓ RotZ: Determines the angle that the component is currently rotated 
around the Z (blue) axis. When your component isn’t rotated, this angle 
is 0. Entering a value of 90 for this attribute rotates your component 90 
degrees. Note that positive values rotate counterclockwise, and negative 
ones (like –90) rotate clockwise.

What to do when someone
clicks with the Interact tool

164
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ OnClick: Determines what happens when someone clicks Door with the 
Interact tool. Here, the ANIMATE function tells Door to animate while it 
changes the value of RotZ, which in turn causes the door to swing open 
or closed. The two numbers after RotZ in the function are the values I 
want it to plug into that attribute when I click with the Interact tool: 0 
degrees, and then 130 degrees (or –130 degrees, for the door on the left 
side). It returns to the beginning when it gets to the end of the list, so 
clicking multiple times tells RotZ to alternate between 0 and 130 (or –130) 
degrees forever.
 
You can choose between a couple of other animation functions; ANIMATE is 
just the simplest to understand. The others let you control things like duration 
and easing (speeding up and slowing down). Check out the list of functions in 
Component Attributes and experiment.
 
You can find all of the Dynamic Components in this chapter on this book’s 
companion Web site. You can also find videos, color images, and links to other 
DC help resources. You should definitely dissect as many DCs as you can to 
see how they work; taking a look at the Dynamic Components Training collec-
tion in your Components dialog box is a great place to start.

H
ere’s something you already know: There’s more to life than model-
ing buildings. Even though SketchUp is really good at letting you make 
models of built structures, you can use it to build just about anything you can 
think of — all it takes is time, ingenuity, and the ability to take a step back 
and break things down into their basic parts. SketchUp provides some fan-
tastic tools for creating forms that aren’t the least bit boxy, but they’re not 
as obvious as Push/Pull and Rectangle, so most people never find them. This 
chapter is devoted to helping you discover SketchUp’s “rounder” side.
In this chapter, I present tools, techniques, and other tips for creating forms 
that are distinctly unbuilding-like — my hope is that you’ll use them to push 
the limits of what you think SketchUp can do.
Extruding with Purpose: Follow Me
Follow Me is probably the best example of a powerful SketchUp tool with 
kind of an underwhelming name. The problem that faced the software 
designers when they were trying to figure out what to call their new baby was 
this: It does what other 3D modeling programs dedicate two or three other 
tools to doing. They chose an unconventional name because it’s a wholly 
unconventional tool.
In the following sections, I talk about how to use Follow Me to create a 
number of different types of shapes; examples of these are shown in 
Figure 6-1 and are as follows:

✓ Pipes, gutters, and moldings: If you look closely, all three of these 
things are basically created by extruding a 2D face along a 3D path; the 
result is a complex 3D form.
 
✓ Chamfers, fillets, and dados: Without explaining what all of these things 
are (I get to that later in this chapter), know this: You can use Follow Me 
to cut away profiles, too.
Using Follow Me
At its core, Follow Me lets you create forms that are extrusions. It’s a little 
bit like Push/Pull, except that it doesn’t just work in one direction. You tell 
Follow Me to follow a path, and it extrudes a face all along that path. This 
means that you need three things to use Follow Me:
 
✓ A path: In SketchUp, you can use any edge, or series of edges, as a 
path. All you have to do is make sure that they’re drawn before you use 
Follow Me.
 
✓ A face: Just like with Push/Pull, Follow Me needs a face to extrude. You 
can use any face in your model, but it needs to be created before you 
start using Follow Me.
 
✓ Undo: Imagining what a 2D face will look like as a 3D shape isn’t easy — it 
usually takes a couple of tries to get a Follow Me operation right. That’s 
what Undo is for, after all.
Follow these steps to use Follow Me; Figure 6-2 shows a basic example of how 
it works:
 
1. Draw a face to use as an extrusion profile.
 
 In this example, I’m creating a pipe, so my extrusion profile is a circular 
face.

Follow Me

Select the whole path
Click the face with Follow Me
 
2. Draw an edge (or edges) to use as an extrusion path.
 
 Although the edge (or edges) is touching the face in this case, it doesn’t 
have to for Follow Me to work.
 
3. Select the complete extrusion path you want to use.
 
 Check out the section on making selections in Chapter 2 for pointers on 
using the Select tool to best advantage.
 
4. Activate the Follow Me tool by choosing Tools➪Follow Me.
 
5. Click the face you want to extrude.
 
 Magic! Your face (extrusion profile) is extruded along the path you 
chose in Step 3, creating a 3D form (in this case, a section of pipe).
 
If you want to use Follow Me all the way around the perimeter of a face, you 
don’t need to spend time selecting all the individual edges. Just select the face 
and then use Follow Me; the tool automatically runs all the way around any 
face you have selected.
You can use Follow Me another way, too: Instead of preselecting a path (as 
in Step 3 of the preceding list), you can click any face with Follow Me and 
attempt to drag it along edges in your model. While this works on simple 
things, I find that preselecting a path works a lot better — it’s really the only 
option for using Follow Me in a predictable way.
Making lathed forms like 
spheres and bottles
And nuclear power plant chimneys. A surprising number of things can be 
modeled by using Follow Me to perform a lathe operation. A lathe is a tool 
that carpenters (and machinists) use to spin a block of raw material while 
they carve into it — that’s how baseball bats are made (the good ones, 
anyway).
A simple example of a lathed object is a sphere. Here’s how you might make 
one with Follow Me:

168
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
1. Draw a circle on the ground.
 
2. Rotate a copy of your circle up by 90 degrees, as shown in Figure 6-3.

 If you’re wondering how to do this, follow these steps:
 
a. Select the face of your circle with the Select tool.
 
b. Choose Tools➪Rotate to activate the Rotate tool.
 
c. Press Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to tell SketchUp you want to make a 
copy.
 
d. Click a green endpoint inference along the edge of your circle and 
hold down your mouse button to drag. Don’t let go just yet.
 
e. Still dragging, move your cursor over to the endpoint on the exact 
opposite side of your circle; then release your mouse button. Now 
your axis of rotation is a line right through the center of your circle.
 
f. Click anywhere on the edge of your circle, and then move your 
mouse over a little bit.
 
g. Type in 90 and press Enter.
 
 You can read all about the Rotate tool in the sidebar “Wrapping your 
head around the Rotate tool,” later in this chapter.
 
3. Make sure that one of your circles is selected.
 
4. With the Follow Me tool, click the circle that’s not selected (see 
Figure 6-4).
 
 Now you have a sphere. The Follow Me tool lathed your circular face 
around the path you selected — the other circle.
 
If you really need a sphere, the easiest way to get one is in the Components 
dialog box. The Shapes library that comes installed with SketchUp has a 
selection of spheres (and cones and other things) you can choose from.
If you want to make your curved surfaces look smooth (hiding the edges 
between them), check out the sidebar “Smoothing out those unsightly 
edges,” later in this chapter.

Under normal circumstances, you only have to model half a profile to use 
Follow Me to make it three-dimensional. Figure 6-5 shows a few different 
examples of 3D objects.

Creating extruded shapes like 
gutters and handrails
A lot of the time, you’ll want to use Follow Me to create geometry (edges 
and faces) that’s attached to another part of your model. An example of this 
might be modeling a gutter that runs all the way around the roof of your 
house. In this case, you’re likely to already have the path along which you 
want to extrude a profile (the edge of the roof).
When you’re using Follow Me to extrude a face along a path that consists 
of edges that already exist as part of your model, there are two things you 
should always do:
 
✓ Before using Follow Me, make the rest of your model a separate 
group. Take my word for it — Follow Me can sometimes mess things up, 
so you want to be able to keep the geometry it creates separate, just in 
case.

170
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ Make a copy of your extrusion path outside your group. There’s a con-
sequence to working with Follow Me on top of a group: The edge (or 
edges) you want to use as an extrusion path will no longer be available, 
because you can’t use Follow Me with a path that’s in a separate group 
or component.
 
 What to do? You need to make a copy of the path outside the group, and 
then use the copy to do the Follow Me operation. Here’s the best way to 
make a copy of the path:
 
1. With the Select tool, double-click your group to edit it.
 
2. Select the path you want to use for Follow Me.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Exit (stop editing) your group by clicking somewhere else in your 
modeling window.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place. Now you have a copy of the path you 
want to use, and it’s outside your group.
 
Take a look at Chapter 17. You’ll find a Ruby script (don’t worry — I explain 
what that means) called “Weld” that’s super-useful for creating extrusion 
paths for Follow Me.
When you’re using an existing edge (or series of edges) as an extrusion path, 
the hard part is getting your profile in the right place. You have a choice 
of two ways to proceed; which one you use depends on what you need to 
model:
 
✓ Draw the profile in place. Do this only if the extrusion path is parallel to 
one of the colored drawing axes.
 
✓ Draw the profile on the ground and then move it into position. If your 
extrusion path doesn’t start out parallel to a colored drawing axis, you 
should probably draw your profile somewhere else and move it into 
place later.
Drawing your profile in place
Consider that I have a model of a house. I want to use Follow Me to add a 
gutter that goes all the way around the perimeter of the roof. I decide to draw 
the profile in place (right on the roof itself) because the edges of the roof 
are drawn parallel to the colored drawing axes. This means that I’ll have an 
easier time using the Line tool to draw in midair.
The trick to drawing an extrusion profile that isn’t on the ground is to start 
by drawing a rectangular face. You then draw the profile on the face and 
erase the rest of the rectangle. Figure 6-6 shows how you would draw the pro-
file of a gutter directly on the corner of a roof; the steps that follow explain 
the same things in words:

171
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
Why your computer is so slow
When you use Follow Me with an extrusion 
profile that’s a circle or an arc, you’re creating 
a piece of 3D geometry that’s very big. By big, 
I mean that it has lots of faces, and faces are 
what make your computer slow down. Without 
going into detail about how SketchUp works 
(I don’t really know that anyway), keep this in 
mind: The more faces you have in your model, 
the worse your computer’s performance will be. 
At a certain point, you’ll stop being able to orbit, 
your scenes (which I talk about in Chapter 10) 
will stutter, and you’ll be tempted to do some-
thing terrible to someone you don’t know.
The first pipe in the figure that follows has been 
extruded using Follow Me. It was made with a 
24-sided circle as an extrusion profile, and it 
has 338 faces. Hidden Geometry is turned on (in 
the View menu) so that you can see how many 
faces you have.
The second pipe uses a 10-sided circle as an 
extrusion profile. As a result, it only has 116 
faces. What an improvement!
The third pipe also uses a 10-sided circle as 
an extrusion profile, but the arc in its extrusion 
path is made up of only 4 segments, instead 
of the usual 12. It has a total of 52 faces. Even 
better.
The second image in the figure shows all three 
pipes with Hidden Geometry turned off. Is the 
difference in detail worth the exponential 
increase in the number of faces? Most of the 
time, the answer is no.
To change the number of sides in a circle or an 
arc, just before or just after you create it, follow 
these steps:
 1. Type in the number of sides you’d like to 
have.
 2. Type an s to tell SketchUp that you mean 
“sides.”
 3. Press Enter.

 I can’t tell you how many people try to work without filling their 
modeling windows with the subject at hand. Not doing so is 
like trying to do a crossword puzzle while looking the wrong 
way through a pair of binoculars. Get close — SketchUp models 
don’t bite!

 This involves paying careful attention to SketchUp’s inference engine; 
watch the colors to make sure that you’re drawing in the right direction.

173
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
3. Use the Line tool (and SketchUp’s other drawing tools) to draw your 
profile directly on the rectangle you just drew.
 
 The important thing here is to make sure that your extrusion profile is a 
single face; if it’s not, Follow Me won’t work the way you want it to.
 
4. Erase the rest of your rectangle, leaving only the profile.
Drawing your profile somewhere else
The awful thing about handrails is that they’re almost always at funny angles, 
not parallel to a colored axis. When it’s not convenient to draw your extrusion 
profile in place, it’s best to draw it on the ground and move it into position 
afterwards.
Wrapping your head around the Rotate tool
In the last version of SketchUp, the software’s 
designers introduced a feature that pretty much 
everybody realizes is great: You can establish 
your axis of rotation (the invisible line around 
which you’re rotating) while you’re using the 
Rotate tool. This makes it about a million times 
easier to rotate things around, and those of us 
who use SketchUp a lot danced little jigs (albeit 
awkwardly) when we heard the news.
By default, the Rotate tool “sticks” itself to 
whatever plane you happen to be hovering 
over — that’s why it changes color as you move 
its big, round cursor all over your screen. When 
it’s blue, its axis of rotation is the blue axis; the 
same goes for red and green. When it’s black, 
its axis of rotation doesn’t line up with any of the 
colored drawing axes.
If you want to show SketchUp the axis of 
rotation you want to use while you’re using the 
Rotate tool, you can. In this case, using Rotate 
goes from being a three-step operation to a 
five-step one (check out the following figure for 
a visual explanation):
 1. Click once to establish your center of 
rotation, but don’t let go — keep your finger 
on your mouse button.
 2. Drag your cursor around (still holding the 
mouse button down) until your axis of rota-
tion is where you want it. As you drag, you’ll 
notice your Rotate cursor changing orienta-
tion; the line from the center of the cursor to 
your mouse is the axis of rotation.
 3. Release your mouse button to set your axis 
of rotation.
 4. Click (but don’t drag) the point at which you 
want to “pick up” whatever you’re rotating.
 5. Click again to drop the thing you’re rotating 
where you want it.
Whew! It takes practice, but it’s worth it. The 
efficiency you gain by being able to rotate 
things in free space is huge. Two more things 
about Rotate, while I’m on the subject:
 ✓ Type in a rotate angle during or after you 
rotate something. Check out the section

 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
Here’s the trick: Draw a tail — a short edge — perpendicular to your extru-
sion profile. You can use this tail to help line up your profile with the edge 
you want to use as an extrusion path for Follow Me. The following steps, and 
Figure 6-7, describe how you would draw and position a profile for a handrail:

2. Draw a short edge perpendicular to the face you just drew.
 
 This tail should come from the point where you want your profile to 
attach to the extrusion path.

176
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Make your profile and its tail into a group.
 
 This makes it easier to move and rotate around all at once. See Chapter 
5 for information on creating and using groups, if you need it.
 
4. Using the Move tool, place your profile at the end of the extrusion 
path.
 
 To make sure that you position it accurately, pick it up by clicking the 
point where the tail meets the face, and drop it by clicking the end of the 
extrusion path.
 
5. With the Rotate tool, rotate your profile into position.
 
 Here’s where you need to use a bit of skill. See the nearby sidebar, 
“Wrapping your head around the Rotate tool,” for guidance. The Rotate 
tool is easy to use when you get the hang of it.
 
6. Right-click the group you made in Step 3 and choose Explode; delete 
your tail.
Subtracting from a model with Follow Me
What if you want to model a bar of soap? Or a sofa cushion? Or anything that 
doesn’t have a sharp edge? The best way to round off edges in SketchUp is to 
use Follow Me. In addition to using it to add to your model, you can also sub-
tract from your model.
Here’s how it works: If you draw an extrusion profile on the end face of a long-
ish form, you can use Follow Me to remove a strip of material along whatever 
path you specify. Figure 6-8 demonstrates the concept on the top of a box.
 
If the extrusion path you want to use for a Follow Me operation consists of the 
entire perimeter of a face (as is the case in Figure 6-8), you can save time by 
just selecting the face instead of all the edges that define it.
But what if you want to create a corner that’s rounded in both directions, 
as so many corners are? That one’s a little trickier to do in SketchUp, but 
because it’s such a common problem, I thought I’d devote a few hundred 
words to explaining how to do it. The basic technique involves using Follow 
Me on a corner you’ve already rounded with the Push/Pull tool. After you 
have a corner that’s filleted with an arc of the correct radius, you can use 
copies (or component instances, if you’re clever) of that corner several 
times, wherever you need them. It’s not what I’d call an elegant solution, but 
it’s possible, and it works when you need it to.

Figure 6-9 gives a step-by-step, visual account of the process, while I explain 
it in words, as follows:
 
1. Draw a box.
 
 It doesn’t really matter how big, as long as it’s big enough for the fillet 
you want to apply.
 
2. With the Arc tool, draw an arc on the corner of the box.
 
 When you’re drawing an arc on a corner, keep an eye out for the 
inferences that help you draw properly:
 
a. After clicking to place one endpoint of your arc, as you cut across 
the corner, the point at which your line turns magenta is where 
your endpoints are equidistant (the same distance) from the corner 
across which you’re cutting.
 
b. After clicking to place your second endpoint, you see a point at 
which the arc you’re drawing turns magenta — this means your 
arc is tangent to (continuous with) both edges it’s connected to. 
You want this to be the case, so you should click when you see 
magenta.

 I strongly recommend reducing the number of sides on your arc before 
you start filleting away. See the sidebar “Why your computer is so slow,” 
earlier in this chapter, to find out why.
 
3. Push/pull the new face down to round off the corner.

179
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
4. Draw another, identical arc on one of the corners directly adjacent to 
the corner you just rounded.
 
 This is where you’ll have to refer to Figure 6-14. Pictures are better than 
words when it comes to explaining things like which corners are adja-
cent to which.
 
5. Select the edges shown in Figure 6-14.
 
6. Activate the Follow Me tool.
 
7. Click the arc corner face to extrude it along the path you selected in 
Step 4.
 
8. Hide or smooth out any edges that need hiding or smoothing.
 
 For information about hiding edges, see the sidebar “Making two halves 
look like one whole,” earlier in this chapter. Check out the “Smoothing 
out those unsightly edges” sidebar for the whole scoop on how to 
smooth edges.
After you have a fully rounded corner, you can use a bunch of them to 
make anything you want; it just takes a little planning. Figure 6-10 shows 
a simple bar of soap I created out of eight rounded corners, copied and 
flipped accordingly. The text (in case you’re wondering) was created with 
SketchUp’s 3D Text tool, which you can find on the Tools menu.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Modeling with the Scale tool
It’s not obvious, but real heroes rarely are. The Scale tool is, in my opinion, 
the single most misunderstood member of SketchUp’s mercifully limited 
toolkit. New modelers assume that Scale is for resizing things in your model. 
That’s technically true, but most folks only use it to resize whole objects; the 
Smoothing out those unsightly edges
If you’re wondering how to get rid of all the ugly 
lines you end up with when you use Follow Me, 
the answer is pretty simple: You can smooth 
edges, just like you can hide them. (See the side-
bar “Making two halves look like one whole,” 
earlier in this book, for more information about 
hiding edges.) The difference between hiding 
and smoothing is illustrated by the images of 
the cylinders in the figure that follows:
 ✓ When you hide an edge between two faces, 
SketchUp still treats those faces as though 
your edge is still there — it just doesn’t 
show the edge. Materials you’ve applied to 
each face stay separate, and each face is 
lit separately by SketchUp’s sun. The latter 
fact is the reason why simply hiding the 
edges between faces that are supposed 
to represent a smooth curve doesn’t make 
things look smooth — you still end up with 
a faceted look.
 ✓ When you smooth an edge between two 
faces, you’re telling SketchUp to treat 
them as a single face — with a single 
material and smooth-looking shading. The 
difference is pretty huge, as you can see in 
the second cylinder.
You can smooth edges in two different ways:
 ✓ Use the Eraser. To smooth edges with the 
Eraser tool, hold down Ctrl (Option on the 
Mac) while you click or drag over the edges 
you want to smooth.
 ✓ Use the Soften Edges dialog box. Located 
on the Window menu, this dialog box lets 
you smooth a bunch of selected edges all 
at once, according to what angle their adja-
cent faces are at. It’s a little complicated at 
first, but here’s what you need to know to 
get started: Select the edges you want to 
smooth, and then move the slider to the right 
until things look the way you want them to.
To unsmooth edges, follow these steps:
 1. Turn on Hidden Geometry to make edges 
visible.
 2. Select the edges you want to unsmooth.
 3. In the Soften Edges dialog box, move the 
slider all the way to the left.

 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
real power of Scale happens when you use it on parts of objects to change 
their shape. Take a look at Figure 6-11 to see what I mean.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Getting the hang of Scale
The basic principle of this technique is pretty simple: You select the geom-
etry (edges and faces) in your model that you want to resize, activate the 
Scale tool, and go to town.
 
Here’s a list of steps, just so it’s crystal clear (Figure 6-12 tells the story in 
pictures):
 
Figure 6-12: 
The Scale 
tool is a 
cinch 
to use.
 
 
1. Select the part of your model that you want to scale.
 
 Use the Select tool to do this; check out the latter part of Chapter 2 if 
you need a refresher.
 
2. Activate the Scale tool by choosing Tools➪Scale from the menu bar.
 
 You can also make Scale active by clicking its button on the toolbar, or 
by pressing S on your keyboard. After you activate Scale, the geometry 
you selected in Step 1 should be enclosed in a box of little green cubes 
called grips.
 
3. Click a grip and then move your mouse to start scaling your selected 
geometry.
 
 Take a look at the next part of this section for the lowdown on all the dif-
ferent grips.
 
4. When you’re finished scaling, click again to stop.
While I’m on the subject of Scale, here are a few more things you should 
know:
 
✓ Use different grips to scale different ways. Which grip (the little green 
boxes that appear when you activate the Scale tool) you use determines 
how your geometry scales:
 
• Corner grips scale proportionally — nothing gets distorted when 
you use them.
 
• Edge and side grips distort your geometry as you scale — use 
them to squeeze what you’re scaling.

183
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
✓ Hold down Shift to scale proportionally. This happens automatically if 
you’re using one of the corner grips, but not if you’re using any others. If 
you don’t want what you’re scaling to be distorted, hold down Shift.
 
✓ Hold down Control (Option on a Mac) to scale about the center of your 
selection. I find myself doing this more often than not.
 
✓ Type in a scaling factor to scale accurately. To scale by 50 percent, 
type 0.5. Typing 3.57 scales your geometry by 357 percent, and typing 
1.0 doesn’t scale it at all. Take a look at Chapter 2 to read more about 
using numbers while you work.
 
✓ Which grips appear depend on what you’re scaling. Have a look at 
Figure 6-13 to see what I’m talking about.
 
Figure 6-13: 
Grips 
depend on 
what you’re 
trying to 
scale.
 
This face is off-axis
This face is perpendicular
 to blue axis
 
• Most of the time, you’ll see a scaling box enclosed by 26 green 
grips.
 
• If you’re scaling flat, coplanar geometry (faces and edges that all lie 
on the same plane), AND that plane is perfectly aligned with one of 
the major planes in your model, then you get a rectangle consisting 
of 8 grips instead of a box comprised of 26.
 
• If what you’re scaling is a Dynamic Component, you may see any-
where from 0 to all 26 grips; it depends on how the builder set up 
the component. Take a look at Chapter 5 for more information 
about Dynamic Components.
 
✓ You can’t make a copy while you’re scaling. Both the Move and Rotate 
tools let you make copies by holding down a button on your keyboard 
while you’re using them, but Scale doesn’t work this way, unfortunately. 
If you need to make a scaled copy, try this instead:
 
1. Select the geometry that you want to scale and copy.
 
2. Make it into a group. (See Chapter 5 for more information on 
making groups.)
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy from the menu bar.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place from the menu bar.
 
5. Scale the copied group as you would anything else.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Scaling profiles to make organic forms
Here’s where it gets really interesting. I need to thank über-SketchUpper 
Justin Chin (who goes by the handle monsterzero online) for demonstrating 
the power of this technique. It’s great because it’s easy to understand and 
powerful enough to be applied all over the place; that’s why I’m so excited to 
show it to you in this book.
So what is it? This method involves using the Scale tool in combination with 
a series of 2D profiles to create curvy, lumpy, distinctly un-boxy 3D shapes. 
An awful lot of the stuff in the universe fits squarely in this category: me, you, 
slugs, intergalactic alien fighter vessels, bananas — just about everything 
that wasn’t made by a machine can be modeled using the “scaled profiles” 
method of 3D modeling.
Combining Scale and Push/Pull
 
The simplest way to use this method is in association with Push/Pull. Here’s a 
very simple example of how it works (check out Figure 6-14 for an illustrated 
view):
 
1. Create a 2D shape.
 
 This shape might be something simple (like a circle), or something more 
complex; it all depends on what you’re trying to model. It might also be 
a “half-shape” if what you’re trying to make exhibits bilateral symme-
try. Take a look at the last section in Chapter 5 for more information on 
using components to build symmetrical models.
 
2. Push/pull your 2D shape into a 3D form.
 
3. Scale the new face you created so it’s slightly bigger (or slightly 
smaller) than the original 2D shape from Step 1.
 
 Refer to the previous section in this chapter for more specifics about 
using the Scale tool. Pay special attention to the points about using mod-
ifier keys (keyboard buttons) to scale proportionally or about the center 
of what you’re working on.
 
4. Push/pull the face you scaled in the previous step.
 
 Try to make this extrusion about the same as the one you made in Step 2. 
 
 Remember that you can usually double-click a face with the Push/Pull 
tool to repeat the last Push/Pull operation you did.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you’re done.
 
 You can add skillful use of the Rotate tool into the mix if you like; doing 
so allows you to curve and bend your form as you shape it.

Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Keep the following tidbits in mind as you explore this technique:
 
✓ Watch your polygon count. Polygons are faces, basically — the more 
you have, the “heavier” your model becomes, and the worse it performs 
on your computer. Try to minimize the number of faces you’re working 
with by reducing the number of edges in your original 2D shape. Have a 
look at the sidebar “Why your computer is so slow,” earlier in this 
chapter, for the whole scoop.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to go back and tweak. The beauty of this method is its 
flexibility. While you’re working, you can select any of the 2D profiles 
(shapes) in your model and use the Scale tool to tweak them. Just select 
the loop of edges along the perimeter of the profile you want to scale 
and take it from there. Check out Figure 6-15 to see what I’m referring to.
 
Figure 6-15: 
You can go 
back and 
scale any 
profile at 
any time 
while you’re 
working.
 
Combining Scale and Follow Me
Another way to create extruded forms is to use Follow Me. (See the first part 
of this chapter if you need a refresher.) This technique is ideally suited to 
making long, curvy, tapered things like tentacles and antlers. It’s a little time 
consuming, but it works like a charm.
Modeling a simplified bull’s horn is a good, straightforward illustration of 
how the Follow Me variation of this method works. Here’s how I’d go about it; 
take a look at Figure 6-16 to see the story in pictures:
 
1. Draw a circle.
 
 This is the extrusion profile for Follow Me. Strongly consider reducing 
the number of sides in your circle from the standard 24 to something 
more like 10 or 12. See the sidebar “Why your computer is so slow” (ear-
lier in this chapter) to find out how and why you should do this.
 
2. Draw a 10-sided arc that starts perpendicular the center of the circle 
you drew in Step 1.
 
 Type 10s and press Enter right after you click to finish drawing your arc. 
This tells SketchUp to make sure your arc has 10 sides (instead of the 
default 12). Why 10 sides? It makes the math easier a few steps from now.

187
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

with Follow 
Me to 
create long, 
tapered 
forms (like 
this bull’s 
horn).
 
 
 The easiest way to create a halfway-accurate arc in 3D space is to start by 
drawing a rectangle. Once you’re sure this rectangle is properly situated, 
use the Arc tool to draw on top of it, then delete everything but the arc.

188
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Select the arc you just drew.
 
 This is the extrusion path for Follow Me.
 
4. Activate the Follow Me tool by choosing Tools➪Follow Me from the 
menu bar.
 
5. Click the circle you drew in Step 1 to extrude it along the path you 
drew in Step 2.
 
6. Choose View➪Hidden Geometry from the menu bar.
 
 Showing the hidden geometry in your model lets you select the edges 
that were automatically smoothed (made hidden) when you used Follow 
Me in Step 5.
 
7. Scale the face at the end of your new extrusion by a factor of 0.1.
 
 See “Getting the hang of Scale,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions 
on how to do this. Use any of the four corner grips on the scaling box, 
and don’t forget to hold down Control (Option on a Mac) while you’re 
scaling — this forces SketchUp to scale about the center of the face 
you’re resizing.
 
8. Select the edges that define the next-to-last profile in your extruded 
form.
 
 Depending on the angle of your arc, making this selection can get tricky. 
Here are some considerations that might help:
 
• See Chapter 2 for tips on making selections.
 
• Choose View➪Face Style➪X-ray from the menu bar to make it 
easier to see what you’ve selected.
 
• Hold down Control (Option on a Mac) while you’re orbiting to turn 
off SketchUp’s “blue is up/down gravity bias.” While orbiting this 
way, try drawing lots of tight, little circles with your mouse to get 
your view to tilt in the direction your want. This is by no means 
simple stuff, but getting the hang of temporarily disabling the 
Orbit tool’s tendency to keep the blue axis straight up and down 
is a very nifty way to work. Doing so makes it infinitely easier to 
get just the right angle for making a window selection. This in turn 
makes selecting the edges that define profiles a whole lot easier, 
and that’s what becoming a Zen master of the Orbit tool is all 
about.
 
9. Scale the edges you selected in the previous step by a factor of 0.2.
 
 Starting to see what’s happening?
 
10. Repeat Steps 8 and 9 for each of the remaining profiles in your form, 
increasing the scaling factor by 0.1 each time.
 
 Of course, you can absolutely choose to sculpt your form however you 
like, but this method (counting up by tenths) yields a smooth taper.

189
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
Have a look at the Santa and reindeer project in the color insert (in the center 
of this book) to get an idea of the kind of fancy, not-a-box models you can 
build once you master the Scale tool. It’s not beginner-level material, but it’s 
worth the time when you’re ready for it. 
Digging Around in the Sandbox
Continuing in the grand tradition of building extremely powerful tools and 
then hiding them away so you’ll never find them, the people at SketchUp 
introduced the Sandbox in version 5 of the software. It’s not new, but owing 
to its less-than-obvious location, most SketchUp users have never used it. So 
what’s the Sandbox for? Here are the facts:
 
✓ The Sandbox is a collection of tools. You’re supposed to use them to 
model things like terrain — the stuff your buildings sit on (or in, if what 
you’re making is underground). That said, like all of SketchUp’s tools, 
they’re incredibly flexible. You can use them to model anything you want.
 
✓ The Sandbox is in both free and Pro: Despite what many people think, 
the Sandbox tools aren’t just for Pro users; people who use the free ver-
sion of SketchUp can use them, too. They’re just hidden, which brings 
me to my next point.
 
✓ The Sandbox is hidden. The reasons for this are complicated, but the 
tools in the Sandbox are a little bit special; they’re extensions, which 
means that you have to find them and turn them on before you can start 
using them. If you’re using SketchUp Pro 7, you can skip the first two 
steps in the following list — they’re already turned on.
 
 Follow these steps to switch on the Sandbox tools:
 
1. Choose Window➪Preferences from the menu bar to open the 
Preferences dialog box. (Choose SketchUp➪Preferences if you’re 
on a Mac.)
 
2. In the Extensions panel, make sure the Sandbox Tools check box is 
selected.
 
3. Close the Preferences dialog box.
 
4. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Sandbox from the menu bar to show the 
Sandbox toolbar.
Taking inventory of the Sandbox tools
Before you dive into using them, I think it’s helpful to know what each of the 
tools in the Sandbox actually does. The following sections provide a rundown 
on what you’ll find.

190
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
From Contours
You know the squiggly lines on topographical maps that show you where the 
hills and valleys are? They’re called contour lines (or contours) because they 
represent the contours of the terrain; every point on a single line is the same 
height above sea level as every other point on that line. Where the lines are 
close together, the ground between them is steep. Where the lines are far 
apart, the slope is less steep. Cartographers, surveyors, engineers, and archi-
tects use contour lines to represent 3D terrain in flat formats like maps and 
site drawings.
Sometimes, you’ll have contour lines for a building site that you want to 
model in 3D. You can use the From Contours tool in the Sandbox to automati-
cally generate a three-dimensional surface from a set of contour lines. Have a 
look at Figure 6-17 to see what I’m talking about.
Here are some things to keep in mind about the From Contours tool:
 
✓ It’s a two-step tool. Using From Contours is simple once you get the 
hang of it:
 
1. Select all of the Contour lines you want to use to create a surface.
 
2. Choose Draw➪Sandbox➪From Contours from the menu bar (or click 
the From Contours tool button, if the Sandbox toolbar is visible).
 
 If you can’t see the Sandbox tools in your menus, you haven’t turned them 
on yet. See the previous section in this book to rectify the situation.
 
✓ Your contour lines need to be lifted up. The From Contours tool 
creates a surface from contour lines that are already positioned at their 
proper heights in 3D space. Most of the time you’ll be working with 
contours that were part of a 2D drawing, and that means you’ll probably 
have to lift them up yourself using the Move tool — one at a time. It’s 
tedious but necessary. Just oil up the Select tool, put on some music, 
and get to work. For a refresher on selecting things, take a look at the 
last part of Chapter 2.
 
✓ You’ll end up with a group. When you use From Contours, SketchUp 
automatically makes your new surface (the one you generated from your 
contour lines) into a group. It leaves the original lines themselves com-
pletely alone; you can move them away, hide them, or delete them if you 
want. I recommend making another group out of them, putting them on 
a separate layer (see Chapter 7 for more on this) and hiding that layer 
until you need it again.
 
 To edit the faces and edges inside a group, double-click it with the Select 
tool to go inside it. Refer to Chapter 5 for all the details on groups and 
components.

192
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ To edit your new surface, turn on Hidden Geometry. The flowing, 
organic surface you just created is actually just a bunch of little tri-
angles. The From Contours tool smoothes the edges that define them, 
but they’re there. To see them, choose View➪Hidden Geometry from the 
menu bar.
 
✓ Try to keep it reasonable. The From Contours tool is super useful, but 
it has its limits. The trouble is that it’s too easy to use it to create enor-
mous amounts of geometry (faces and edges) that can really bog down 
your system. If it’s taking forever for your contours to turn into a sur-
face, or if that surface is so big that your computer turns blue and curls 
up into a fetal position (so to speak), you need to go back a few steps 
and do one (or perhaps all) of the following:
 
• Work on a smaller area. As nice as it would be to have the whole 
neighborhood in your SketchUp model, you might have to narrow 
your scope. Only creating what you need is good modeling policy.
 
• Only use every other contour line. Doing this effectively halves 
the amount of geometry in your resulting surface.
 
• Dumb down the contour lines themselves. This is a little bit 
hard to explain, but here goes: The From Contours tool works by 
connecting adjacent contour lines together with edges that form 
triangles. How many triangles it creates depends on how many 
individual edge segments are in each contour line; Figure 6-18 
provides an illustration. Unless you created the contour lines to 
begin with — there’s a good chance you imported them as part of 
a CAD drawing — you have no control over how detailed they are. 
Redrawing each contour line is a major bummer, but luckily, you 
can download a great Ruby script called Simplify Contours that 
makes the process much simpler. Take a look at Chapter 16 for 
more information on using Ruby scripts.
 
✓ You don’t have to start with existing contour lines. In fact, drawing 
your own edges and using From Contours to generate a surface from 
them is one of the most powerful ways to create organic, non-boxy 
forms in SketchUp. Take a look at the next part of this chapter to see 
what I mean.
 
✓ Get ready to do some cleanup. The surfaces that From Contours cre-
ates usually need to be cleaned up to some extent. Use the Eraser to 
delete extra geometry (you’ll find lots along the top and bottom edges of 
your surface), and the Flip Edge tool to correct the orientation of some 
of your triangular faces. Keep reading to find out more about this.

193
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings

triangles

start with.
 
Low-detail lines yield fewer triangular faces
Flip Edge
Flip Edge is a simple beast, but it’s indispensable if you’re working with the 
From Contours tool. Basically, you use it to clean up the surfaces that From 
Contours creates. When you turn contour lines into a surface, you get lots 
and lots of triangular faces. Sometimes, the From Contours tool decides to 
draw an edge between the wrong two line segments, creating two triangular 
faces that form a “flat spot” in your surface. Figure 6-19 shows what I’m talk-
ing about.
You get rid of these flat spots manually by flipping the edges that create 
them. Doing so changes the resulting triangular faces, usually making them 
end up side-by-side (instead of one-above-the-other).
To use the Flip Edge tool (Tools➪Sandbox➪Flip Edge), just click the edge you 
want to flip. If you’re not sure about an edge, go ahead and flip it, then see if 
things look better. If they don’t, you can always undo or flip it back.
From Scratch
You use the From Scratch tool to create a big, flat rectangle that represents 
a chunk of terrain. Since it’s already divided into triangular faces, it’s easy to 
use the Smoove tool (which I talk about next in this chapter) to shape it into 
hills, valleys, berms, sand traps, and whatever else you have in mind.

takes made

Flip incorrect edges
Here’s the thing, though: It’s a very rare occasion that you have carte blanche 
with a piece of land. Unless you’re designing something like a golf course in 
the middle of a dry lake bed, or terraforming a new planet for colonization, 
you probably have pre-existing terrain conditions to contend with. And if 
that’s the case, you’re probably better starting off with a set of contour lines 
that describe those conditions — I talk all about the From Contours tool ear-
lier in this chapter.
So although the From Scratch Tool works great, I doubt you’ll end up needing 
to use it much. All the same, here’s how to do so, just in case.
Follow these steps to create a new terrain surface with the From Scratch tool, 
and take a look at Figure 6-20 while you’re at it:
 
1. Choose Draw➪Sandbox➪From Scratch from the menu bar to activate 
the From Scratch tool.
 
2. Type in a grid spacing amount and press Enter.

195
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
Figure 6-20: 
Use the 
From 
Scratch tool 
to create big 
swatches of 
flat terrain. 
Ah, the pos-
sibilities. . . .
 
 
 The default grid spacing amount is 10 feet, which means the tool draws 
a rectangle made up of squares that are 10 feet across. The grid spacing 
you choose depends on how big an area you’re planning to model, and 
on how detailed you plan to make the terrain for that model.
 
 If I were modeling a single-family house on a reasonably sized lot, I’d 
probably use a grid spacing of 2 feet — that would provide enough detail 
for elements like walkways and small berms without creating too much 
geometry for my computer to handle. If I were laying out an 18-hole golf 
course, on the other hand, I’d choose a grid spacing closer to 50 feet, 
then add detail to certain areas later on.

196
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Click to position one corner of your new terrain surface where you 
want it.
 
4. Click to determine the width of the surface you’re drawing.
 
5. Click to establish the length of your new terrain surface.
 
 When you’re done, the great big rectangle you’ve created will automati-
cally be a group. Double-click with the Select tool to edit it, and good 
luck. You’ll probably decide to use the Smoove tool next; read on to find 
out how.
Smoove
It’s a tool for moving smoothly — get it? Smooth + Move = Smoove. I’ll wait 
while you compose yourself.
Smoove is actually one of the coolest tools in SketchUp. It lets you shape ter-
rain (or any horizontal surface that’s made up of smaller, triangular faces) 
by pushing and pulling (sort of) bumps and depressions of any size. It’s fun 
to use, and it yields results that you’d be hard-pressed to produce with any 
other tool in SketchUp. Figure 6-21 shows what Smoove can do.
Follow these steps to shape a surface with Smoove:
 
1. Double-click the group containing your terrain to begin editing it.
 
 If your terrain isn’t part of a group, then forget I said that.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Sandbox➪Smoove from the menu bar to activate the 
Smoove tool.
 
3. Type in a radius and press Enter.
 
 Smoove creates lumps and bumps and dimples that are circular. The 
radius you enter here determines how big those lumps and bumps and 
dimples should be.
 
4. Click somewhere on your terrain surface to start smooving.
 
5. Move your mouse up or down (to create a bump or a depression), then 
click again to stop smooving.
Fun, huh? Here are some more things to keep in mind when you’re using 
Smoove:
 
✓ Use the From Scratch tool beforehand. You don’t have to, but creating a 
surface with the From Scratch tool (described earlier in this chapter) is by 
far the easiest way to end up with terrain which you can smoove easily.
 
✓ Try smooving to edit other terrain surfaces. You can also use Smoove 
after you create a terrain surface with the From Contours tool. In fact, 
Smoove works on any geometry — it just works best on surfaces made 
up of triangular faces.

197
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
Figure 6-21: 
Smoove 
creates 
shapes that 
are unlike 
anything 
else you can 
make with 
SketchUp.
 
 
✓ Double-click to repeat your previous Smoove. As with Push/Pull, 
double-clicking tells SketchUp to carry out the same operation as you 
did the last time you used the tool.

198
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ Pre-select to smoove shapes other than circles. Any faces and edges 
you select before you use the Smoove tool will move up (or down) by 
a constant amount. This means you can use Smoove to create things 
like ridges and ditches by selecting the right geometry beforehand. 
Figure 6-22 provides a much-needed picture of what I mean.

Stamp
Eventually, you might need to plunk a building (or some other structure) 
down on the terrain you’ve lovingly crafted. The Stamp tool provides an easy 
way to — you guessed it — stamp a building footprint into a terrain surface, 
creating a flat “pad” for something to sit on. It also provides a way to create 
a gently sloping offset around the perimeter of your stamped form. This cre-
ates a smoother transition between the new, flat pad and the existing terrain.
Follow these steps to use the Stamp tool; check out Figure 6-23 to see the cor-
responding pictures:

199
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
Figure 6-23: 
Use the 
Stamp tool 
to create 
a nice, flat 
spot for your 
building.
 
 
1. Move whatever it is you want to stamp into position above your ter-
rain surface.
 
 It shouldn’t be touching; it should be floating in space directly above your 
terrain. Also, it helps to make a group before you start moving anything; 
take a look at Chapter 5 to find out all about groups and components.
 
 If you’re having trouble moving it into position accurately, I suggest moving 
it to the correct height first, then switching to a top, no-perspective view 
to finish the job. Look in the Camera menu for both of these commands.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Sandbox➪Stamp from the menu bar to activate the 
Stamp tool.

200
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Click the floating object to tell SketchUp what you want to use as the 
stamp.
 
4. Type in an offset distance, then press Enter.
 
 The offset distance is the amount of space around the perimeter of 
whatever you’re stamping that SketchUp uses to smooth the transition 
between the flat spot it’s creating and the existing terrain. The offset 
amount you choose depends entirely on what you’re stamping. Go nuts, 
and thank your lucky stars for Undo.
 
5. Move your cursor over your terrain surface and click again.
 
6. Move (but don’t drag) your mouse up and down to position the flat 
pad in space, then click again to finish the operation.
Here are a couple of things you should know about using Stamp:
 
✓ SketchUp uses the bottommost face in your stamp object as the tem-
plate for the flat pad it creates in your terrain.
 
✓ Go back a few pages and read about the Flip Edge tool; Stamp creates 
triangular faces that sometimes need cleaning up.
Drape
The Drape tool works a little like a cookie cutter; you use it to transfer edges 
from an object down onto another surface, which is directly beneath it.
Perhaps you have a gently-sloping terrain, and you want to draw a meander-
ing path on it. The path only has to follow the contours of the terrain, but you 
still want to paint it with a different material — so it needs to be a separate 
face. In this case, you’d draw the path on a separate face and use the Drape 
tool to transfer it to your terrain surface.
Taking the above example, follow these steps to use the Drape tool to draw a 
path on a non-flat terrain surface (Figure 6-24 illustrates the steps):
 
1. Use the Line tool (see the last part of Chapter 2) to draw a flat face 
somewhere directly above your terrain surface.
 
 If you can, it’s not a bad idea to make your flat face exactly the same size 
as your terrain. Just make sure it’s big enough for whatever you’re plan-
ning to draw next (in this example, a path).
 
2. Paint the face you just created with a translucent material.
 
 I find that a light gray works well; there’s a good one in the Translucent 
library, inside the Materials dialog box.

 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
 
Figure 6-24:

to transfer

202
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. Use the Line tool to carry up any important points on your terrain 
surface.
 
 In this case, I want to make sure my path begins precisely at the door of 
the building, so I draw vertical lines from the sides of the door to the flat 
face directly above. That way, I’ll have something to snap to in Step 6.
 
4. Choose Camera➪Standard Views➪Top from the menu bar to switch to 
a top view.
 
5. Choose Camera➪Parallel Projection from the menu bar to turn off 
perspective.
 
6. On the upper face, draw the edges you’d like to drape.
 
 Make sure that your edges form closed loops to create faces. If they 
don’t, you’ll have a miserable time trying to paint the path (in this case) 
once it’s draped onto your terrain surface.
 
7. Orbit your model so you can see both the upper and lower surfaces.
 
8. Soften/smooth the edges of the triangles in your terrain surface (if 
they aren’t already).
 
 To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Select all of the edges and faces in your terrain.
 
2. Choose Window➪Soften Edges from the menu bar.
 
3. In the Soften/Smooth Edges dialog box, move the slider all the 
way to the right and make sure that both the Smooth Normals and 
Soften Coplanar check boxes are selected.
 
9. Select the edges you want to drape.
 
 If your edges define closed faces, you can select those faces instead; 
sometimes that’s easier than selecting a bunch of individual edges. Take 
a look at the last part of Chapter 2 for tips on selecting things.
 
10. Choose Draw➪Sandbox➪Drape from the menu bar to activate the 
Drape tool.
 
11. Click once on your terrain surface to drape the edges you selected in 
Step 9.
 
 It doesn’t matter if your terrain is inside a group — the Drape tool will 
work anyway.
Add Detail
Like the Flip Edge tool, Add Detail is kind of a one-trick pony. You use it to 
add triangles to areas of your terrain surface that need more detail. That way, 
you can save geometry (and file size, and waiting) by only having lots of faces 
in the areas of your terrain that require it. If I were designing a golf course, I’d 
use very big triangles for the vast majority of it. I’d use the Add Detail tool to 
add triangles to areas where I planned to have smallish things like sand traps.

203
 Chapter 6: Going Beyond Buildings
You can use the Add Detail tool in two different ways:
 
✓ Add detail to an area all at once. This is actually my favorite way to 
use this tool; it’s quick and easy to understand. All you have to do is 
select the faces on your terrain you want to subdivide, then choose 
Tools➪Sandbox➪Add Detail from the menu bar. Take a look at Figure 
6-25 to see what happens when you do.
 
✓ Add detail to faces one at a time. To be honest, I’ve never used the 
tool this way, but here goes: You can activate the tool (see the previous 
bullet) without having any geometry selected, then click faces or edges 
on your terrain to divide them into more faces. I suppose this comes in 
handy when you’re modeling something very precisely.
Roughing out a site
Perhaps your building is sitting on a piece of land that isn’t flat, and you want 
to model the terrain around it. Maybe you’re trying to reproduce existing site 
conditions, or maybe you’re in the process of designing the landscape for a 
project. You can use From Contours to quickly generate a surface from just a 
few simple outlines.
Follow these steps to model a terrain surface with the From Contours tool 
(see Figure 6-26):
 
1. Extend the bottom of your building down so the exterior walls drop 
below ground level.
 
2. Make your building into a group. 
 
 See Chapter 5 if you need help.
 
3. Use SketchUp’s drafting tools to draw the outline of the chunk of ter-
rain you want to model around the building. 
 
 You should end up with a horizontal face by using a combination of the 
Tape Measure and Line tools. Keep in mind that this outline should be

line you draw is below, above, or in line with the building — you’ll see 
why in the next step.
 
4. Use the Push/Pull tool to extrude the face you drew in Step 3 into a 
box that extends above and below your building, then delete the top 
and bottom faces of the box you just drew.
 
5. Paint the walls of your box with a translucent material.
 
 You can find some in the Translucent library, in the Materials dialog box.
 
6. Draw edges on the sides of the box that represent where the ground 
should intersect them.

All hail the From Contours tool
I really can’t stress enough how useful the From 
Contours tool is. All it does, really, is connect 
edges in 3D space with more edges, which 
in turn creates triangular faces. The folks at 
SketchUp designed it to make it easier to create 
terrain, but you can use it create all kinds of 
irregular surfaces.
The following image shows a tent canopy that I 
created in about ten minutes with the Line tool, 
the Arc tool, the Eraser, and From Contours.
Full credit for this discovery goes to my 
friend Daniel Tal, a landscape architect and 
SketchUpper extraordinaire who regularly 
builds models that defy explanation. In fact, 
Daniel has written a book about SketchUp 
and design that should be available at your 
local bookstore. If you’re serious about build-
ing smart, clean models, I highly recommend 
checking it out.

 Take a look at the previous section in this book for some tips on using 
From Contours; at this point, you need to use the Flip Edge tool and the 
Eraser to do some cleanup — particularly in the area where your build-
ing is supposed to go.

Chapter 7
Keeping Your Model Organized
In This Chapter
▶ Taking stock of your model with the Outliner
▶ Avoiding problems by using layers the right way
▶ Looking at how everything works together
S
tarting with this chapter, I might sound like your mom: “Clean up your 
room! Don’t leave your toys in the driveway! Put your dishes in the 
sink!” As everybody knows, living life can be a messy ordeal, and modeling in 
SketchUp is no exception. As you crank away at whatever it is you’re build-
ing, you will reach a time when you stop, orbit around, and wonder how your 
model got to be such a pigsty. It’s inevitable.
Luckily, SketchUp includes a bunch of different ways to keep your geometry 
(edges and faces) from getting out of control. Because big, unwieldy, dis-
organized models are a pain to work with — they can slow your computer, 
or even cause SketchUp to crash — you should definitely get in the habit 
of “working clean” (as cooking shows like to call it). As I said earlier, I don’t 
mean to nag; I just want you to be familiar with the techniques experienced 
SketchUp modelers use to keep from going insane.
In this chapter, I present the two main tools that SketchUp provides for 
organizing your model. In the first section, I outline both and talk about what 
they’re for. Then I dive in to each one in a good amount of detail, describing 
how to use them and how not to use them (are you listening, layers?). This 
chapter ends with a detailed example of how both methods can be used 
together to make your life easier; I show you how I organize a model of my 
house.

210
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Taking Stock of Your Organization 
Options
When it comes to sorting out the thousands of edges and faces in your 
model, it’s all about lumping things together into useful sets. After you’ve 
separated things out, you can name them, hide them, and even lock them so 
that you (or somebody else) can’t mess them up.
 
If you haven’t read about groups and components yet, now would be a good 
time to go back and take a look at Chapter 5 — the stuff in this chapter is best 
understood if you have a firm grasp on the stuff in that one.
You have two organizational methods at your disposal in SketchUp. The best 
modelers use both all the time:
 
✓ Outliner: The Outliner is a dialog box that’s basically a fancy list of 
all the groups and components in your SketchUp model. It shows you 
which groups and components are nested inside other ones, lets you 
assign names for them, and gives you an easy way to hide parts of your 
model you don’t want to see. If you use a lot of components (and you 
should), the Outliner may well become your new best friend.
 
✓ Layers: This is where a lot of people reading this book let out a big sigh 
of relief. “Thank goodness,” they’re thinking, “I was beginning to think 
SketchUp doesn’t have layers.” For people who are used to organizing 
content in other software programs, layers are usually where it’s at — you 
put different kinds of things on different layers, name the layers, and then 
turn them on and off when you need to. It’s a pretty simple concept.
 
 In SketchUp, layers are similar, but there’s a problem: Using layers the 
wrong way can seriously mess up your model. I’m not kidding. If you’re 
going to use them, read the section “Discovering the Ins and Outs of 
Layers,” later in this chapter. Not doing so could result in serious injury 
or even death (depending on how upset you get when your 50-hour 
model gets ruined).
Seeing the Big Picture: The Outliner
I’m a person who really likes to make lists. Not only that, but I love to look at 
lists — information arranged neatly into collapsible rows is the kind of thing 
that brings a tear to my eye.

211
 Chapter 7: Keeping Your Model Organized
Now, before you decide that I ought to be locked in a small room with cush-
ions on the walls, consider this: most halfway-complicated SketchUp models 
consist of dozens, if not hundreds, of groups and components. These groups 
and components are nested inside each other like Russian dolls, and a lot of 
them are heavy, computer-killing behemoths like three-dimensional trees and 
shrubs.
Without a list, how are you going to manage all your groups and compo-
nents? How are you going to keep track of what you have, hide what you 
don’t want to see, and (more importantly) unhide what you do want to see? I 
thought so — I guess it turns out I’m not so crazy after all.
Taking a good look at the Outliner
You can open the Outliner dialog box by choosing Window➪Outliner. 
Figure 7-1 shows what it looks like when a model consists of a simple room 
with some furniture in it. Each piece of furniture is a separate component 
which I downloaded from the Google 3D Warehouse. (Check out Chapter 5 
for the whole story.)

212
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
The Outliner dialog box has the following features:
 
✓ Search filter box: If you type a word or phrase into this box, the 
Outliner only shows the items in your model that include that word or 
phrase in their name. If I were to type in coffee, only the coffee table 
component would be visible.
 
✓ Outliner Options flyout menu: This handy little menu contains three 
options:
 
• Expand All: Choose this option to have the Outliner show all the 
nested groups and components in your model — every last one of 
them (provided they’re on visible layers).
 
 It’s important to note that the Outliner only shows groups and 
components that exist on layers that are visible in your model. 
In other words, anything on a hidden layer won’t appear in the 
Outliner, so be extra careful if you’re using both the Outliner and 
layers to organize your model. You can read all about layers in the 
next section.
 
• Collapse All: This option collapses your Outliner view so that 
you only see top-level groups and components — ones that aren’t 
nested inside other groups and components.
 
• Sort by Name: Select this option to make the Outliner list the 
groups and components in your model alphabetically.
 
✓ Outliner List window: All the groups and components in your model are 
listed here. Groups and components that have nested groups and com-
ponents inside them have an Expand/Collapse toggle arrow next to their 
names. When they’re expanded, the constituent groups and components 
appear as an indented list below them.
Making good use of the Outliner
 
If you’re going to use lots of groups and components (and you should), having 
the Outliner open on your screen is one of the best things you can do to model 
efficiently. 
Here’s why:
 
✓ Use the Outliner to control visibility. Instead of right-clicking groups 
and components in your model to hide them, use the Outliner instead. 
Just right-click the name of any element in the Outliner and choose Hide. 
When you do, the element is hidden in your modeling window, and its 
name is grayed out and italicized in the Outliner. To unhide it, just right-
click its name in the Outliner and choose Unhide.

213
 Chapter 7: Keeping Your Model Organized
 
✓ Drag and drop elements in the Outliner to change their nesting order. 
Don’t like having the component you just created nested inside another 
component? Simply drag its name in the Outliner to the top of the list. 
This moves it to the top level, meaning that it’s not embedded in any-
thing. You can also use the Outliner to drag groups and components 
into other ones, too.
 
✓ Find and select things using the Outliner. When you select something 
in the Outliner, its name gets highlighted and it is selected in your mod-
eling window. This is a much easier way to select nested groups and 
components, especially if you’re working with a complex model. 
Discovering the Ins and Outs of Layers
I’m gonna give it to you straight: Layers are a very useful part of SketchUp, 
and they can make your life a lot easier. Layers can also be a major source of 
heartache, because they can really mess up your model if you’re not careful. 
I’ll try to get you going on the right track.
What layers are — and what they’re not
In a 2D program like Photoshop or Illustrator, the concept of layers makes 
a lot of sense: You can have content on any number of layers, sort of like a 
stack of transparencies. You find a distinct order to your layers, so anything 
that’s on the top layer is visually in front of everything on all the other layers. 
Figure 7-2 shows what I’m talking about.
 
Figure 7-2: 
In 2D soft-
ware, layers 
are pretty 
straightfor-
ward.
 

214
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
But hold on a second — SketchUp isn’t a 2D program; it’s a 3D program. So 
how can it have layers? How can objects in three-dimensional space be lay-
ered on top of each other so that things on higher layers appear in front of 
things on lower ones? In short, they can’t — it’s impossible. This means that 
layers in SketchUp are different from layers in most other graphics programs, 
and that’s confusing for lots of people.
 
SketchUp has a layers system because some of the very first SketchUp users 
were architects, and many, many architects use drawing software called 
AutoCAD. Because AutoCAD uses layers extensively, layers were incorporated 
into SketchUp to maximize compatibility between the two products. When you 
import a layered AutoCAD file into SketchUp, its layers show up as SketchUp 
layers, which is pretty convenient.
 
So what are SketchUp layers for? Layers are for controlling visibility. You use 
them to gather particular kinds of geometry so that you can easily turn it on 
(make it visible) and turn it off (make it invisible) when you need to. That said, 
layers don’t work the same way as groups and components; your edges and 
faces aren’t isolated from other parts of your model, which can cause major 
confusion if you’re not careful. Take a look at the section “Staying out of trou-
ble,” later in this chapter, to find out more.
Using layers in SketchUp
You can find the Layers dialog box on the Window menu. It’s a pretty simple 
piece of machinery, as you can see in Figure 7-3. Here’s what everything does:
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Layers 
dialog box.
 
Add Layer
Delete Layer
Layer Options flyout menu
Layers list
 
✓ Add Layer: Clicking this button adds a new layer to your SketchUp file.
 
✓ Delete Layer: Click this button to delete the currently selected layer. If 
anything is on the layer you’re trying to delete, SketchUp will ask you 
what you want to do with it; choose an option and select Delete.

215
 Chapter 7: Keeping Your Model Organized
 
✓ Layer Options flyout menu: This contains the following useful options:
 
• Purge: When you choose Purge, SketchUp deletes all the layers 
that don’t contain geometry. This is a handy way to keep your file 
neat and tidy.
 
• Color by Layer: Notice how each layer in the list has a little 
material swatch next to it? Choosing Color by Layer temporarily 
changes all the colors in your SketchUp model to match the colors 
(or textures) assigned to each layer. To see what’s on each layer, 
this is the way to go.
 
✓ Layers list: This is a list of all the layers in your SketchUp file. You need 
to know about these three columns:
 
• Name: Double-click a layer’s name to edit it. Giving your layers 
meaningful names is a good way to quickly find what you’re 
looking for.
 
• Visible: This check box is the heart and soul of the Layers dialog 
box. When it’s selected, the geometry on that layer is visible; when 
it’s not, it’s not.
 
• Color: You can choose to view your model using Color by Layer, 
which I describe in the previous list. You can choose which mate-
rial (color or texture) to assign to each layer by clicking the Color 
swatch.
Adding a new layer
Follow these steps to add a layer to your SketchUp file:
 
1. Choose Window➪Layers.
 
 This opens the Layers dialog box.
 
2. Click the Add Layer button to add a new layer to the Layers list.
 
 If you want, you can double-click your new layer to rename it.
Moving entities to a different layer
Moving things from one layer to another involves using the Entity Info dialog 
box. Follow these steps to move an entity (an edge, face, group, or compo-
nent) to a different layer:
 
1. Select the entity or entities you want to move to another layer.
 
 Keep in mind that you should only be moving groups and components to 
other layers; have a look at the next section in this chapter to find out why.
 
2. Choose Window➪Entity Info.
 
 This opens the Entity Info dialog box. You can also open it by right-
clicking your selected entities and choosing Entity Info from the context 
menu.

216
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
3. In the Entity Info dialog box, choose a layer from the Layer drop-down 
list.
 
 Your selected entities are now on the layer you chose from the list.
Staying out of trouble
As I said before, layers can be really helpful, but you need to know how to 
use them; if you don’t, bad things can happen. Here’s some more detail:
 
✓ Do all your modeling on Layer0. Always make sure that Layer0 is your 
current layer when you’re working. Keeping all your loose geometry 
(that’s not part of a group or component) together in one place is the 
only way to make sure that you don’t end up with edges and faces all 
over the place. SketchUp, unfortunately, lets you put geometry on what-
ever layer you want, which means that you can end up with a face on 
one layer, and one or more of the edges that define it on another. When 
that happens, it’s next to impossible to work out where everything 
belongs; you’ll spend literally hours trying to straighten things out. This 
property of SketchUp’s layers system is a major stumbling point for new 
SketchUp users; knowing to keep everything on Layer0 can save you a 
lot of anguish.
 
✓ Don’t move anything but groups and components to other layers. If 
you’re going to use layers, follow this rule: Never put anything on a layer 
other than Layer0 unless it’s a group or a component. Doing so ensures 
that you don’t end up with stray edges and faces on separate layers.
 
✓ Use layers to organize big groups of similar things. More complicated 
SketchUp models often include things like trees, furniture, cars, and 
people. These kinds of things are almost always already components, 
so they’re perfect candidates for being kept on separate layers. I often 
make a layer called Trees and put all my tree components on it. This 
makes it easy to hide and show all my trees all at once. This speeds my 
workflow by improving my computer’s performance. (Trees are usually 
big, complicated components with lots of faces.)
 
✓ Don’t use layers to organize interconnected geometry; use the 
Outliner instead. By interconnected geometry, I mean things like building 
floor levels and staircases. These model parts aren’t meant to be physi-
cally separate from other parts (like vehicles and people are). When you 
put Level 1 on one layer and Level 2 on another, more often than not, 
you’ll get confused about what belongs where: Is the staircase part of 
Level 1 or Level 2? Instead, make a group for Level 1, a group for Level 2,
and a group for the staircase — you’ll need less headache medicine at 
the end of the day.

217
 Chapter 7: Keeping Your Model Organized
 
✓ Feel free to use layers to iterate. Iteration is the process of doing multi-
ple versions of the same thing. Lots of designers work this way to figure 
out problems and present different options to their clients. Using layers 
is a great way to iterate: You can move each version of the thing you’re 
working on to a different layer, and then turn them on and off to show 
each in turn. Just remember to follow the rule about only using groups 
and components on separate layers (mentioned previously), and you’ll 
be fine.
Putting It All Together
 
In this chapter (and in Chapter 5), I talk about each of SketchUp’s organiza-
tional methods in isolation: discussing how they work, why they’re special, 
and when to use them. In fact, you’ll probably end up using a combination of 
all of them when you’re working in SketchUp, so I thought it might be helpful 
to see an example of everything in action.
Figure 7-4 (along with a couple of the pages in this book’s color insert) shows 
a model of a small house I’m building in SketchUp. I’m using all of SketchUp’s 
organizational tools to help me manage my model’s complexity while I’m 
working:

218
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
✓ Each floor level is a group. By working with each floor level as a sepa-
rate group, I’m able to use the Outliner to hide whichever one I’m not 
working on. This makes it easier to see what I’m doing. I’m including the 
house’s only staircase in the first floor group, because that turns out to 
be the easiest thing to do.
 
 I’ve decided to include the interior walls on each level of my house in 
that level’s group. I don’t think I’ll ever have to hide them, so it wasn’t 
worth making them a separate group. For what it’s worth, I think the 
same thing probably applies to most buildings, unless you plan to study 
different floor plans with different interior wall arrangements.
 
✓ The roof and exterior walls are groups inside of another group. I want 
to be able to “remove” the roof and the exterior walls separately, so I’ve 
made each of them a group. I also want to be able to hide and unhide 
them both at the same time, so I made a group called Shell that includes 
both of them. Using the Outliner, I can selectively show or hide just the 
geometry I want. (See Figure 7-5.)
 
 The floor levels, roof, and exterior walls of my house are groups instead 
of components because they’re unique — I only have one First Floor, so 
it doesn’t need to be a component.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Each floor of 
my house, 
as well as 
the roof and 
the exterior 
walls, is a 
group.
 
All groups are visible
Shell group is hidden
Only First Floor group is visible
 
✓ All the furniture and plumbing fixtures are components. All the com-
ponents I use to furnish my house are ones I either built myself, took 
from the Components dialog box, or found in the 3D Warehouse.
 
 But I only have one couch: Why make it a component instead of a group? 
By making every piece of furniture in my model a component, I’m able 
to see a list of my furniture in the In Model collection of the Components 
dialog box. (See Figure 7-6.) I can also save that as a separate compo-
nent collection on my computer. The next time I move, I’ll have all my 
furniture in a single place, ready to drop into a model of my new house.

219
 Chapter 7: Keeping Your Model Organized
 
Figure 7-6: 
Because all 
my pieces 
of furniture 
are com-
ponents, I 
can use the 
Components 
dialog box 
to make 
my own, 
custom 
component 
collection.
 
 
✓ All my furniture is on a separate layer. Because furniture components 
can be a little heavy (taxing my computer system), and because I want to 
be able to see my house without furniture, I created a new layer (called 
Furniture) and moved all my furniture onto it. Using the Layers dialog 
box, I can control the visibility of that layer with a single click of my 
mouse.
 
 But why not just create a group from all my furniture components and 
use the Outliner to hide and unhide them all, instead of bothering with 
layers? Good question. Because it’s easier to change a component’s 
layer than it is to add it to an existing group. To add something to a 
group, I would need to use the Outliner to drag and drop it in the proper 
place; with complex models, this can be a hassle. Changing a compo-
nent’s layer is just a matter of using the Entity Info dialog box to choose 
from a list.

Modeling with Photographs
In This Chapter
▶ Painting faces in your model with photographs
▶ Tweaking your textured faces with the Texture Tweaker
▶ Modeling on top of photo-textured faces
▶ Building a model from scratch with SketchUp’s photo-matching tools
▶ Using photo-matching to match your model to a photograph
T
hese days, it’s next to impossible to meet someone who doesn’t take pic-
tures. Aside from the millions of digital cameras out there, lots of mobile 
phones have cameras in them, too. I expect that by the time I’m working on 
the next edition of this book, I’ll be writing about the digital cameras we all 
have in our sunglasses — just wink to take a snapshot and then blink three 
times to e-mail it to your grandma.
You can use all these photos you’re taking in SketchUp in a couple of differ-
ent ways:
 
✓ If you have a model you’d like to paint with photographs, you can 
do that in SketchUp. You can apply photos to faces and then use the 
information in the pictures to help you model; building windows is a lot 
easier when they’re painted right on the wall. That’s what I talk about in 
the first part of this chapter.
 
✓ If you want to use a photo to help you model something from scratch, 
you can do that in SketchUp, too. Photo-matching makes it (relatively) 
simple to bring in a picture, set things up so that your modeling window 
view matches the perspective in the photo, and then build what you see 
by tracing with SketchUp’s modeling tools. Sound like fun? It is — and 
that’s why I devote the whole second half of this chapter to it.
 
Neither of these techniques is what I’d call super-easy — that’s why I put this 
chapter at the end of the modeling part of this book. If you haven’t at least 
skimmed through Chapter 4, I recommend doing so; you’ll spend less time 
scratching your head and thinking evil thoughts about me.

222
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Painting Faces with Photos
Funny thing about the tool I’m about to explain: Nobody really seems to know 
what it’s called. During its development, the SketchUp team referred to it as 
the Texture Tweaker, mostly because both words start with the same letter, 
and they thought that was catchy. For some reason, it’s called the Position 
Texture tool in SketchUp’s Help documentation, even though it’s not really a 
tool — at least not in the traditional sense. There’s no button for the Texture 
Tweaker/Position Texture tool; you can only get to it by choosing a command 
from a menu. All the same, it’s one of SketchUp’s coolest — and most useful — 
“hidden” features.
I refer to it by its original name; I’m a sucker for alliteration. Here are some of 
the things you can do with the Texture Tweaker:
 
✓ Stick artwork to 3D prototypes or packaging designs
 
✓ Create photo-realistic buildings that you can upload (send) to Google 
Earth (See Chapter 11 for more detail on this.)
 
✓ Figure out where things like windows, doors, signs, and ornamentation 
belong on your building models
Adding photos to faces
Technically, painting surfaces with pictures using 3D software is mapping, as 
in “I mapped a photo of your face to the underside of the pile-driver model 
I’m building.” Different software programs have different methods for mapping 
pictures to faces, and luckily, SketchUp’s is very straightforward.
 
Mapping photos of building facades to your building models with the Texture 
Tweaker/Position Texture tool has a number of benefits:
 
✓ Using photographs can make your models look more realistic.
 
✓ Taking advantage of details that are visible in a photograph (instead of 
modeling them) results in a smaller, easier-to-manage model.
 
✓ You can use a photograph to help you locate building elements, like 
doors, windows, and signs, if you plan to model them.
 
✓ Models to which you apply photo textures can be submitted to the 
3D Warehouse, where they might be used on Google Earth’s default 
Buildings layer (Chapter 11 has all the details on this).

223
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
 
SketchUp uses lots of different terms to refer to the stuff you can paint faces 
with; generically, they’re all called materials. Materials can be colors or tex-
tures; textures are image-based, and colors are a single, solid hue. When you 
import an image to map it to a face, it becomes a texture — just like any of the 
other textures in your Materials dialog box. Read more about using materials 
in SketchUp at the end of Chapter 2.
 
Follow these steps to map an image to a face (and find additional help on this 
book’s companion Web site; see the Introduction for details):
Before you begin, I should probably mention that you need to have at least 
one face in your model before you go through these steps; if you don’t, you 
won’t have anything to map your texture to.
 
1. Choose File➪Import.
 
 The Open dialog box opens.
 
2. Select the image file you want to use as a texture.
 
 You can use JPEGs, TIFFs, PNGs, and PDFs as textures in SketchUp; all of 
these are common image-file formats.
 
3. Select the Use as Texture option shown in Figure 8-1.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Make sure 
to pick Use 
as Texture.
 
 
4. Click the Open button.
 
 This closes the Open dialog box, switches your active tool to Paint 
Bucket, and “loads” your cursor with the image you chose to import.
 
5. Click once in the lower-left corner of the face you want to “paint” (see 
Figure 8-2).

224
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
 Where you click tells SketchUp where to position the lower-left corner of 
the image you’re using as a texture. You can click anywhere on the face 
you’re trying to paint, but I recommend the lower-left corner — it keeps 
things simple.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Click once 
to locate the 
lower-left 
corner of 
the image 
you’re using 
as a texture, 
and then 
again to 
locate the 
upper-right 
corner.
 
Click here to place the bottom left
corner of your image...
...then click here to finish
placing your image
 
6. Click somewhere else on the face you’re painting; see Figure 8-2.
 
 Time for a little bit of theory: Image textures in SketchUp are made up of 
tiles. To make a large area of texture (like a brick wall), SketchUp uses a 
bunch of tiles right next to each other. In the case of a brick wall, it may 
look like there are thousands of bricks, but it’s really just the same tile 
of about 50 bricks repeated over and over again.
 
 Because SketchUp treats imported image textures just like any other tex-
ture, what you’re really doing when you click to locate the upper-right 
corner of your image is this: You’re telling SketchUp how big to make 
the tile for your new photo texture. Don’t worry too much about getting 
it right the first time, though — you can always tweak things later on 
(hence the name Texture Tweaker).

225
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
 
Unless the proportions of your image perfectly match the face onto which it 
was mapped, you should see your image repeating. Don’t worry — that’s 
normal. SketchUp automatically tiles your image to fill the whole face. If you 
want to edit your new texture so that it doesn’t look tiled (and you probably 
do), keep reading. You can scale, rotate, skew, or even stretch your texture to 
make it look however you want.
Editing your textures
After you’ve successfully mapped an image to a face, you’re probably going 
to want to change it somehow: make it bigger, flip it over, rotate it around — 
you get the idea. This is where the Texture Tweaker/Position Texture tool 
comes in.
The Position Texture tool is actually more of a mode; I call it Texture Edit 
mode. Within this mode, you can be in either of two submodes. Their names 
are less important than what they do, so that’s how I describe them:
 
✓ Move/Scale/Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture mode: You use this mode 
to move, scale, rotate, shear, or distort your texture (surprised?); it’s 
technical name is Fixed Pin mode — you’ll see why in a little bit.
 
✓ Stretch Texture mode: Stretch Texture mode lets you edit your texture 
by stretching it to fit the face it’s painted on. If you want to map a photo-
graph of a building façade to your model, this is the mode you want to 
use. In SketchUp’s Help documentation, Stretch Texture mode is called 
Free Pin mode, just in case you’re interested.
 
You can only edit textures on flat faces; the Texture Tweaker doesn’t work on 
curved faces. To find out more about working with textures and curved faces, 
see the section, “The tricky case: Mapping photo textures to curved surfaces,” 
later in this chapter.
Moving, scaling, rotating, shearing, and distorting your texture
The title of this section should pretty much say it all — doing the aforemen-
tioned things to your texture involves the Texture Tweaker, which is a little 
bit hidden, unfortunately.
 
Follow these steps to move, scale, rotate, or skew your texture:
 
1. With the Select tool, click the face with the texture you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Face➪Texture➪Position.

226
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
 This enables (deep breath) Move/Scale/Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture 
mode. You should be able to see a transparent version of your image, 
along with four pins, each a different color. Have a look at Color Plate 9 
to see what I’m talking about. If all your pins are yellow, you’re in Stretch 
Texture mode. Right-click your textured face and make sure there’s a 
check mark next to Fixed Pins to switch into the correct mode.
 
 A quicker way to get to Edit mode is to right-click the textured face and 
then choose Texture➪Position from the context menu.
 
3. Edit your texture.
 
 At this point, the things you can do to edit your texture are located in 
two different places.
 
 Right-clicking your texture opens a context menu with the following 
options:
 
• Done: Tells SketchUp you’re finished editing your texture.
 
• Reset: Undoes all the changes you’ve made to your texture, and 
makes things look like they did before you started messing around.
 
• Flip: Flips your texture left to right or up and down, depending on 
which suboption you choose.
 
• Rotate: Rotates your texture 90, 180, or 270 degrees, depending on 
which suboption you choose.
 
• Fixed Pins: When this option is selected, you’re in Move/Scale/
Rotate/Shear/Distort Texture mode (Fixed Pin mode). Deselecting 
it switches you over to Stretch Texture mode, which I talk about in 
the section “Stretching a photo over a face,” later in this chapter.
 
• Undo/Redo: Goes back or forward a step in your working process.
 
 Dragging each of the colored pins has a different effect (see Figure 8-3):
 
• Scale/Shear (Blue) pin: Scales and shears your texture while you 
drag it. Shearing keeps the top and bottom edges parallel while 
making the image “lean” to the left or right.
 
• Distort (Yellow) pin: Distorts your texture while you drag it; in this 
case, the distortion looks like kind of a perspective effect.
 
• Scale/Rotate (Green) pin: Scales and rotates your texture while 
you drag it.
 
• Move (Red) pin: Moves your texture around while you drag it. Of 
all four colored pins, I think this one’s the most useful. I use it all 
the time to precisely reposition brick, shingle, and other building 
material textures in my model.
 
 Instead of just dragging around the colored pins, try single-clicking one 
of them to pick it up; this lets you place it wherever you want (just click 
again to drop it). This comes in especially handy when you’re using the 
Move and Rotate pins.

4. Click anywhere outside your texture in your modeling window to exit 
Edit mode.
 
 You can also right-click and choose Done from the context menu, or 
press Enter.
Stretching a photo over a face
 
The basic metaphor here is one of a photograph printed on a piece of really 
stretchy fabric. You stretch the fabric until the photo looks the way you want 
and then you hold it in place with pins.
 
Follow these steps to stretch your texture using the Texture Tweaker’s Stretch 
Texture mode:
 
1. With the Select tool, click the face with the texture you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Face➪Texture➪Position.
 
 A quicker way to get to Edit mode is to right-click the textured face and 
choose Texture➪Position from the context menu.
 
3. Right-click your texture and deselect the Fixed Pins option (make sure 
that no check mark is next to it).

228
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
 Deselecting Fixed Pins switches you to Stretch Texture mode (or Free 
Pin mode, if you’re reading SketchUp’s online Help). Instead of four 
differently colored pins with little symbols next to them, you should see 
four, identical yellow pins — Figure 8-4 shows you what to expect.
 
Figure 8-4: 
You know 
you’re in 
Stretch 
Texture 
mode when 
all the pins 
are yellow.
 
 
4. Click a pin to pick it up.
 
 Your cursor should clench up into a fist, and the pin should follow it as 
you move your mouse around.
 
 Press Esc to drop the pin you’re carrying without moving it; pressing 
Esc cancels any operation in SketchUp.
 
5. Place the pin at the corner of the building in your photograph by 
clicking once.
 
 If the pin you’re “carrying” is the upper-left one, drop it on the upper-left 
corner of the building in your photograph, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
6. Click and drag the pin you just moved to the corresponding corner of 
the face you’re working on.
 
 If the pin you just moved is the upper-left one, drag it over to the upper-
left corner of the face whose texture you’re “tweaking.” Check out Figure 
8-6 to see this in action.

7. Repeat Steps 4–6 for each of the three remaining pins (see Figure 8-7).
 
 If you need to, feel free to orbit, zoom, and pan around your model to 
get the best view of what you’re doing; just use the scroll wheel on your 
mouse to navigate without switching tools.
 
 A good way to work is to pick up and drop each yellow pin in the general 
vicinity of the precise spot you want to place it. Then zoom in and use 
your better point of view to do a more accurate job.
 
8. Press Enter to exit Texture Edit mode.
 
If you don’t like what you see, just go back and edit the texture again; there’s 
no limit to the number of times you can muck around.

Scaling your model until the photo looks right
When you’re happy with the way your texture is stretched to fit the face, one 
of two things will be true:
 
✓ The proportions are correct. By this, I mean that the photo doesn’t look 
stretched or squashed. This will only be the case if the face to which 
you applied the photo texture was already exactly the right size.
 
✓ The proportions aren’t correct. If the photo texture you just “tweaked” 
looks stretched or squashed, the face it’s on is the wrong size. No 
worries — you just need to stretch the whole face until the texture looks 
right. Better yet, if you know how big the face is supposed to be (in real 
life), you can stretch it until it’s correct.

231
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
 
Follow these steps to stretch a face until the texture looks right:
 
1. Use the Tape Measure tool to create guides that you can use to 
accurately stretch your face.
 
 In this case, I know the building I’m modeling is supposed to be 50 feet 
wide. I talk about using the Tape Measure tool and guides in Chapter 2, 
just in case you need a refresher.
Photomodelers rejoice
For SketchUp 7, the folks at Google added three 
super-useful new features that make it a whole 
lot easier to build efficient (small file size) photo-
textured models.
Make Unique Texture: Right-clicking any face in 
your model and choosing Make Unique Texture 
does two things: It creates a copy of the tex-
ture you’ve selected, and it crops (trims away 
everything that isn’t visible) that copy according 
to the face it’s on. Why is this important? Just 
because you can’t see part of an image doesn’t 
mean it’s not there; SketchUp saves the whole 
photo with the model, even if you only end up 
using a little bit of it. In a complex model with 
dozens of photo textures, all that invisible, extra 
photo data can really add up. Making your 
textures unique can make your models much, 
much smaller.
Combine Textures: This lets you take two or 
more textures in your model and combine them 
into a single texture. Why? The fewer unique 
textures in your model, the smaller its file size. 
Follow these steps to use this feature:
 
 1. Select two or more coplanar (on the same 
plane) faces with different textures applied 
to them.
 
 2. Right-click on any of the faces you 
selected in Step 1 and choose Combine 
Textures. This creates a new texture in the 
In Model library of your Materials dialog 
box. Letting SketchUp delete the interior 
edges (the ones between the faces whose 
textures you combined) further reduces 
your file size because it eliminates faces.
Edit Texture Image: Perhaps there’s something 
in a photograph you’re using, and you don’t 
want it to be there. You use Edit Texture Image 
to open the texture you’ve selected in an image-
editing program; you can edit it directly. Which 
image-editing program actually opens depends 
on what you have installed on your computer; 
you specify which one you want to use in the 
Applications panel of the Preferences dialog 
box. For what it’s worth, most designers use 
Adobe Photoshop, but you can use whatever 
you’ve got.
Follow these steps to use Edit Texture Image:
 
 1. Right-click the texture in your model 
you want to edit and choose Texture➪Edit 
Texture Image.
 
 2. In the program that opens up, make what-
ever changes you need to make.
 
 3. Save (don’t Save As) the image you’re 
editing and close it if you like.
 
 4. Back in SketchUp, check to make sure 
your edits have been applied.

232
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
2. Select the face you want to stretch.
 
 If your model is at a fairly early stage, just select the whole kit and 
caboodle. Triple-click the face with the Select tool to select it and every-
thing attached to it. Figure 8-8 shows my whole model selected, because 
I’m just starting out.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Select 
everything 
you want to 
stretch.
 
 
3. Choose Tools➪Scale to activate the Scale tool.
 
 When the Scale tool’s active, everything that’s selected in your model 
should be surrounded by SketchUp’s Scale Box — its 27 little green 
cubes (they’re called grips) and thick, yellow lines are hard to miss.
 
4. Scale your selection to be the right size (see Figure 8-9).
 
 Use the Scale tool by clicking on the grips and moving your cursor to 
stretch whatever’s selected (including your texture). Click again to stop 
scaling.
 
To scale something precisely using a guide, click a scale grip to grab it and 
then hover over the relevant guide to tell SketchUp that’s where you want to 
scale to. Click again to finish the scale operation.

Modeling on top of photo textures
After you place a photo texture on the right face and in the right place on 
that face (I’m turning into Dr. Seuss), I wouldn’t blame you a bit for wanting 
to use the information in your photograph to help you add geometry to your 
model. It’s a great way to be more or less accurate without having to measure 
much, and the combination of photo textures and a few simple push/pull 
operations can be very convincing.
The thing you have to know
 
Modeling with photo-textured faces isn’t hard, but you have to know one 
critical step before you can do it: You have to make sure that your texture is 
projected.
Figure 8-10 shows what happens when you try to push/pull an opening in a 
photo-textured face: On the left, when the texture isn’t projected, the inside 
faces are painted with random parts of the texture, making your model look 
like a sticker-laden eye puzzle. On the right, when it is projected, note how 
the “inside” faces that are produced by the push/pull operation are a plain, 
easy-to-discern gray. I call this painting with “stretched” pixels, and the result 
is typically more appropriate for what you’re doing.
 
It’s a good idea to make sure that your face’s texture is projected before you 
start drawing on top of it. Happily, telling SketchUp to make a photo texture 
projected is just a matter of flipping a switch. Right-click the face with the 
photo texture and choose Texture➪Projected from the context menu. If you 
see a check mark next to Projected, your texture is already projected; don’t 
choose anything.

1. Make a basic rectangular box.
 
2. Apply a photo texture to one of the side faces.
 
 Check out the section, “Adding photos to faces,” earlier in this chapter.
 
3. Right-click the textured face and choose Texture➪Projected from the 
context menu.
 
 Make sure that Projected has a check mark next to it.
 
4. Draw a rectangle on the textured face and push/pull it inward.
 
 Notice the “stretched pixels” effect?
 
5. Add other angles or features to your model, if you like.
 
 In Figure 8-11, I create an angled face.
 
6. Switch to the Paint Bucket tool.
 
7. Hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) and click somewhere on the textured face 
to sample the texture. (Your cursor should look like an eyedropper 
when you do this.)
 
 This “loads” your Paint Bucket with the projected texture.
 
8. Release the Alt (Ô) key to switch back to the Paint Bucket cursor, and 
click the angled face once to paint it with the projected texture.
 
 You should see the “stretched pixels” effect here, too.
The tricky case: Mapping photo textures to curved surfaces
This is always one of the first things folks ask about, and it always makes me 
wince a little. The thing is, mapping projected textures to curved surfaces 
is complicated, and in four years of SketchUping, I can count the number of 
times I’ve needed to do it on one finger. Nevertheless, you can do it, with a 
little effort.
The key is to line up a flat surface with the curved surface to which you want 
to apply the photo texture. You then “paint” the flat surface with the texture, 
make it projected, sample it, and finally, paint the curved surface with the 
projected, sampled texture. Whew.
 
Follow these steps to get the basic idea (see Figure 8-12):
 
1. Create a curved surface.
 
 In this case, I draw a couple of arcs on the top face of a rectangular 
block and then use Push/Pull to create a curved surface by “pushing” 
one of the top faces down to make it disappear.

236
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
Figure 8-12: 
Mapping 
projected 
textures 
to curved 
surfaces is 
possible, but 
it ain’t easy.
 
 
2. Create a flat surface that lines up with your curved surface.
 
 I use the Line tool and SketchUp’s inferencing system to draw a flat face 
that lines up with (and is the same size as) my curved surface.
 
3. Apply a photo texture to your flat surface and make sure that it’s 
positioned correctly.
 
 You can refer to the earlier parts of this chapter for detailed instructions 
on how to do this.
 
4. Right-click the textured face and choose Texture➪Projected.
 
 This ensures that the texture is projected, which is the key to this whole 
operation.
 
5. Use the Paint Bucket tool with the Alt key (Ô on a Mac) held down to 
sample the projected texture.
 
 This “loads” your Paint Bucket tool with the projected texture.
 
6. Use the Paint Bucket tool without pressing anything on your key-
board to paint the curved surface with the projected texture.
 
 If everything goes as it’s supposed to, the photo texture should be 
painted on your curved surface; the pixels in the image should look 
stretched in some places.
 
7. Delete the flat surface that you originally mapped the image to; you 
don’t need it anymore.

237
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
 
If you’re trying to do this on your own curved surface, and things don’t seem 
to be working, your curved surface is probably part of a group or component. 
Either explode or double-click to edit the group or component before you do 
Step 6 and see if that helps.
Modeling Directly from a Photo: 
Introducing Photo-Matching
The first time I saw SketchUp’s photo-matching feature in action, I giggled 
and clapped my hands like a 2-year-old at a petting zoo. I’m not ashamed of 
it, either. Sometimes technology that’s so useful, so unexpectedly satisfying, 
comes along, and you just can’t help yourself. Besides — people think I’m a 
little strange, anyway.
So what’s it do? You can use this feature to do a couple of things:
 
✓ Build a model based on a photograph: If you have a good photograph 
(or multiple photographs) of the thing you want to model, SketchUp’s 
photo-matching feature can help you set things up so that building your 
model is much easier.
 
✓ Match your model view to a photograph: Perhaps you have a model 
of a building and a photograph of the spot where the building will be 
constructed. You can use photo-matching to position your “camera” in 
SketchUp to be exactly where the real-life camera was when the photo-
graph was taken. Then, you can create a composite image that shows 
what your building will look like in context.
 
Photo-matching only works on photographs of objects with at least one pair of 
surfaces that are at right angles to each other. Luckily, this includes millions 
of things you might want to build, but still, if the thing you want to photo-
match is entirely round, or wavy, or even triangular, this method won’t work.
Looking at all the pretty colors
Like some of SketchUp’s other features, photo-matching is more of a method 
than a tool: You use it to set things up, you model a bit, you use the Match 
Photo dialog box a bit, and so on. If you don’t know the basics of modeling 
in SketchUp yet, you won’t have any luck with photo-matching — it’s really 
more of an intermediate-level feature, if such a thing exists.

238
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
Color Plate 10 shows what your screen might look like when you’re in the 
throes of photo-matching. I’ll admit it’s daunting, but after you’ve used it 
once or twice, it’s not so bad. I include the image in the color section of this 
book because SketchUp’s photo-matching method (at least at the beginning 
of the process) uses color as a critical part of its user interface.
The following elements of the photo-matching interface show up in your 
modeling window:
 
✓ Photograph: The photograph you pick to work with shows up as a kind 
of background in your modeling window; it stays there as long as you 
don’t use Orbit to change your view. To bring it back, click the Scene 
tab (at the top of your modeling window) labeled with the photograph’s 
name.
 
✓ Perspective bars: These come in two pairs: one green and one red. You 
use them when you’re setting up a new matched photo by dragging their 
ends (grips) to line them up with perpendicular pairs of parallel edges in 
your photograph. For a clearer explanation of how this works, see the 
next section in this chapter.
 
✓ Horizon line: This is a yellow, horizontal bar that, in most cases, you 
won’t have to use. It represents the horizon line in your model view, 
and as long as you placed the perspective bars correctly, it takes care of 
itself.
 
✓ Vanishing point grips: These live at both ends of the horizon line, and 
once again, as long as you did a good job of setting up the perspective 
bars, you shouldn’t have to touch them.
 
✓ Axis origin: This is the spot where the red, green, and blue axes meet. 
You position it yourself to tell SketchUp where the ground surface is.
 
✓ Scale line/vertical axis: Clicking and dragging this blue line lets you 
roughly scale your photograph by using the colored photo-matching 
grid lines. After you’re done, you can always scale your model more 
accurately using the Tape Measure tool (check out Chapter 2 for more 
information on how to do this).
You also need to work with a few things that appear outside your modeling 
window:
 
✓ Matched photo scene tab: When you create a new matched photo, you 
create a new scene, too (you can read all about scenes in Chapter 10). 
Clicking a matched photo scene tab returns your view to the one you set 
up when you created (or edited) that matched photo. It also makes the 
associated photograph reappear — handy if you’ve orbited into another 
view.
 
✓ Match Photo dialog box. This is photo-matching Mission Control. It’s 
where you can find almost all the controls you need for creating, editing, 
and working with your matched photo.

239
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
Getting set up for photo-matching
 
Modeling with SketchUp’s photo-matching feature is generally a step-by-step 
procedure. Whether you’re building a new model or lining up an existing 
model with a photograph, you start by getting your modeling window ready. 
How you do this depends on which one you’re trying to do:
 
✓ Use a photograph to build a model: If this is what you want to do, open 
a fresh, new SketchUp file and you’re good to go.
 
✓ Line up a model you’ve built already with a photograph: This case 
requires you to re-orient your view and then reposition your drawing 
axes before you’re ready to begin photo-matching. To do this, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Orbit around until your model view more or less matches the camera 
position in your photograph.
 
2. Choose Tools➪Axes.
 
3. Click to place your Axis Origin somewhere on your model. 
 
 The Axis origin is where your colored axes meet. Try to choose a spot 
that’s also visible in your photograph, if there is one.
 
4. Click somewhere in the lower-left quadrant of your modeling window. 
 
 This ensures that the red axis runs from the upper-left to the lower-right 
corner of your screen.
 
5. Watch your linear inferences to be sure that your repositioned red 
axis is parallel to some of the edges in your model.
 
 Chapter 2 has more about linear inferences.
 
6. Click somewhere in the upper-right quadrant of your modeling 
window to make sure that the blue axis is pointing up.
After your modeling window is set up, follow these steps to create a new 
matched photo in your SketchUp file:
 
1. Choose Camera➪Match New Photo.
 
 A dialog box opens. 
 
2. Select the image on your computer that you want to use and click the 
Open button.
 
 The dialog box closes, and you see the image you chose in your modeling 
window. You also see a jumble of colorful techno-spaghetti all over the 
place. Don’t worry — it’s all part of the photo-matching interface. Figure 
8-13 gives you an idea of what I’m referring to; Color Plate 10 shows the 
same image in color.

 SketchUp’s photo-matching feature requires that you use certain kinds 
of photographs for it to work properly. See the sidebar, “Taking the 
right kind of picture,” later in this chapter, for pointers on what kinds of 
photos you can — and can’t — use.
 
3. In the Match Photo dialog box (which should open automatically), 
choose the style that matches your photograph.
 
 The style buttons in the Match Photo dialog box correspond to three 
different types of photographs you might be using. 
 
• Inside if your photo is an interior view 
 
• Above if it’s an aerial shot 
 
• Outside if your photo is an exterior view taken from a human 
vantage point
 
 Figure 8-14 shows examples of each of these scenarios.
 
4. Begin positioning the perspective bars, starting with the two green 
ones, by lining them up with any two parallel edges. 
 
 The tops and bottoms of windows are good candidates, as are rooflines, 
tabletops, and ceiling tiles. Take a deep breath — this is easier than it 
looks. You move each perspective bar one at a time, dragging each end 
into position separately. Color Plate 11 shows what I mean in color.

 The following tips can help you get the bars positioned correctly:
 
• Zoom in and out (using the scroll wheel on your mouse) to get a 
better view of your photograph while you’re placing your perspective 
bars. The more accurate you can be, the better things will turn out.
 
• Pick nice, long edges in your photograph to match your bars to; 
you’ll get better results that way.
 
• If you’re working with an existing model, it might help to hide it 
while you place your perspective bars; sometimes it gets in the 
way. Just deselect the Model check box in the Match Photo dialog 
box to temporarily hide it.
 
5. Line up the two red perspective bars with a different set of parallel 
edges — just be sure that these parallel edges are perpendicular (at 
right angles) to the first pair.
 
 If the parallel edges aren’t perpendicular to the first set of edges, photo-
matching doesn’t work. Color Plate 12 shows what it looks like when all 
four perspective bars have been positioned properly.
 
6. Drag the axis origin (the little square where the axes come together) 
to a place where your building touches the ground.
 
 This is how you tell SketchUp where the ground plane is. Try to make 
sure your axis origin is right at the intersection of two perpendicular 
edges — it’ll make things easier later on. Color Plate 13 shows what this 
looks like.
 
 If you’re photo-matching an existing model, dragging the axis origin 
moves your model, too. Line up your model with the photograph so
that the spot where you placed the axis origin is right on top of the 
corresponding spot in your photo. Don’t worry about size right now; 
you’ll deal with that in a moment.

242
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
7. Roughly set the scale of your photograph by clicking and dragging 
anywhere on the blue scale/vertical axis line to zoom in or out until 
your photograph looks to be at about the right scale.
 
 You do this by first setting your grid spacing in the Match Photo dialog 
box and then using the grid lines in your modeling window to “eyeball” 
the size of your photo until it looks about right.
 
 Color Plate 14 shows an example where my grid spacing is set at 5 feet 
(the default setting). Because I know the barn in my photo is about 20 
feet tall, I zoom in or out until it’s about 4 grid lines high, because 4 
times 5 feet is 20 feet.
 
 If you’re trying to match an existing model to your photo, just zoom in 
or out until your model looks like it’s the right size.
 
 You don’t have to be very exact at this stage of the game. You can 
always scale your model later by using the Tape Measure tool (Chapter 
2 talks about how to do that).
 
8. Click the Done button in the Match Photo dialog box.
 
 When you click the Done button, you stop editing your matched photo. 
All the colorful lines and grips disappear, and you’re left with the photo 
you brought in, your model axes, and your thoughts. It might have 
seemed like a lot of magic, but what you did was pretty simple: You 
used photo-matching to create a scene (which I talk about extensively 
in Chapter 10) with a camera position and lens settings that match the 
ones used to take the picture that’s on your screen. In effect, you’re 
now “standing” exactly where the photographer was standing when the 
photograph was taken.
Modeling by photo-matching
Setting up a new matched photo was just the first step. Now it’s time to use 
SketchUp’s modeling tools (with a little help from the Match Photo dialog 
box) to build a model based on the photograph you matched. Here are a 
couple of the basic concepts:
 
✓ It’s not a linear process. Building a model using a matched photo entails 
going between drawing edges, orbiting around, drawing some more 
edges, going back to your matched photo scene, and drawing yet more 
edges. Every photo is different, so the ones you work with will present 
unique challenges that you’ll (hopefully) have fun figuring out.
 
✓ Don’t forget the photo textures. By far one of the coolest features of 
photo-matching is the ability to automatically photo-texture your model’s 
faces using your photograph as “paint.” It’s a one-button operation, and 
it’s guaranteed to make you smile.

243
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
Taking the right kind of picture
Your level of success with photo-matching 
depends to some extent on the photograph you 
start out with. Here are some tips for what kind of 
images are good candidates for this process:
 ✓ Cropped photos won’t work. Photo-
matching uses your photo’s center point 
to help figure out its perspective; if you try 
to use a picture that’s been cropped (had 
some of the original shot cut away), the 
center point will be different, and things 
won’t work properly.
 ✓ Make sure that the edges of two perpen-
dicular surfaces are visible in the shot. You 
need to be able to see planes that are at 
right angles to each other to be able to use 
photo-matching properly.
 ✓ Shoot at a 45-degree angle if you can. 
Because of the way perspective works, 
you’ll get a more accurate result if you use 
a photograph where you can see both per-
pendicular surfaces clearly; if one of them 
is sharply distorted, you’ll have a harder 
time. The images in the following figure 
show what I’m talking about.
 ✓ Watch out for lens distortion. When you 
take a picture with a wide-angle lens, 
some of the straight lines in the image bow 
a little bit, depending on where they are in 
the frame. Try to use photos taken with a 
normal or telephoto lens: 50mm to 100mm 
is a good bet.
Good Match Photo candidate: you can see both sides clearly
Bad Match Photo candidate: bad angle

244
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
Follow these steps to start building a model with Photo Match:
 
1. Click the matched photo scene tab to make sure that you’re lined up 
properly.
 
 If you orbit away from the vantage point you set up, you’ll know it; your 
photograph will disappear. You can easily get back by clicking the scene 
tab for your matched photo. It’s labeled with the name of your photo, 
and it’s at the top of your modeling window (see Figure 8-15).

you back to

2. Trace one of the edges in your photograph with the Line tool.
 
 Make sure that you’re drawing in one of the three main directions: red, 
green, or blue. Color Plate 15 shows this in action.
 
 It’s a good idea to start drawing at the axis origin; it’ll help to keep you 
from getting confused.

245
 Chapter 8: Modeling with Photographs
 
3. Keep tracing with the Line tool until you have a rectangular face.
 
 The key here is to make sure that you keep watching the color of your 
edges as you draw. You always want to see your lines turn red, green, or 
blue when you’re starting out. Have a look at Color Plate 16 to see what 
this looks like.
 
 Be careful not to orbit while you’re drawing — if you do, repeat Step 1 
and keep going. You can zoom and pan all you want, though.
 
4. Click the Project Textures from Photo button in the Match Photo 
dialog box.
 
 Every time you do this, SketchUp paints the faces in your model with 
the photograph you used while photo-matching. The face you created in 
Step 3 should now be photo-textured according to the image you used to 
model it. Orbit around and you’ll see what I mean (see Color Plate 17).
 
5. Click the matched photo scene tab to return to your photo-matching 
view.
 
6. Use SketchUp’s modeling tools to continue to “trace” the photograph 
in three dimensions.
 
 Here are some pointers for doing this successfully:
 
• Always start an edge at the end of an edge you’ve already 
drawn. If you don’t, your geometry won’t make any sense, and you 
won’t end up with what you expect.
 
• Never draw an edge in “midair.” Okay — this is the same as the 
last one, but it bears repeating: If you don’t draw edges based on 
other edges, you won’t get good results.
 
• Orbit frequently to see what’s going on. You’ll be surprised what 
you have sometimes — tracing a 2D image in 3D is tricky business. 
Get in the habit of orbiting around to check on things and draw 
certain edges. Click the matched photo scene tab to return to the 
proper view.
 
• Use other tools (like Push/Pull and Offset) when appropri-
ate. Nothing prevents you from using the full complement of 
SketchUp’s modeling tools. I just prefer to stick to Line and Eraser 
while I’m drawing the basic skeleton of my model with SketchUp’s 
photo-matching tools. I think it’s simpler.
 
• Pay attention to the colors. With a photograph as an underlay, it’s 
a little harder to see what you’re doing. But when photo-matching, 
watching to make sure that you’re drawing the edge you intend to 
draw is critical.

246
Part II: Modeling in SketchUp 
 
• Draw angles by “connecting the dots.” If you need to trace an 
edge in your photo that doesn’t line up with any of the colored 
axes (an angled roofline, for example), figure out where the end-
points are by drawing perpendicular edges and connecting them 
with an angled line. Color plate 18 shows this in glorious, full-
spectrum detail.
 
• If you want, keep pressing the Project Textures from Photo 
button to use the photograph to paint your model. Of course, 
using Project Textures from Photo only works on faces that are 
visible in the photograph. For everything else, you need to use the 
Paint Bucket and the Texture Tweaker (which I describe in the first 
part of this chapter) to do your best.
 
If you have more than one picture of the thing you want to model, you can use 
photo-matching on each to help you build it. Just get as far as you can with the 
first photo and then start again with the next, using the geometry you created 
as an “existing building.” Refer back to “Getting set up for photo-matching” 
earlier in this chapter, and follow the steps to line up an existing model with a 
new photograph.
Color Plate 19 shows a model I started to build of Habitat 67, in Montreal. I 
used two pictures to create two matches in the same SketchUp file, which let 
me build more of the model than I could see in a single picture.
 
New for SketchUp 7, you can edit any texture in your model — including ones 
produced by photo-matching — by opening them in image-editing software 
(like Photoshop) directly from SketchUp. This is handy for taking out stuff you 
might not want in your photos, like trees, cars and ex-husbands. Take a look 
at the sidebar “Editing the image itself,” earlier in this chapter, for all the juicy 
details.

Viewing 
Your Model in 
Different Ways

In this part . . .
B
uilding models is actually only half of what Google 
SketchUp is all about. After you’ve actually got 
something built, you can do a whole bunch of things with 
your geometry. Chapter 9 describes Styles, a unique fea-
ture that lets you change the way your model looks. Want 
to make it look hand-drawn? One click. How about some-
thing more realistic? Another click. Using Styles is like 
having a tiny artist strapped to your clicking finger — but 
in a good way.
Also in Chapter 9, I talk about using Shadows to make 
your model look more realistic, and (in cases where it’s 
relevant) to study how the sun will affect your design. Just 
like Styles, applying Shadows to your model is laughably 
easy; it’s just a matter of clicking a box and moving a cou-
ple of sliders around.
Chapter 10 covers three important aspects of exploring 
your model: walking around, Scenes, and Sections. When 
it comes to seeing (and showing off) your model from 
inside SketchUp, this is pretty much where it begins 
and ends.

t’s all fine and well to build elegant and efficient models, but that’s only 
part of what this software’s all about. SketchUp is also a very capable 
tool for presenting the stuff you build. Deciding how it should look — loose 
and sketchy, quasi-photorealistic, or anything in between — can be lots of 
fun, and making the right decisions can go a long way toward helping your 
models communicate what they’re supposed to.
The first half of this chapter is about Styles. If you’re the sort of person who 
likes to draw, you’re in for a treat. If you can’t draw a straight line with a 
ruler, you’re in for an even bigger treat. SketchUp Styles are all about decid-
ing how your geometry — all your faces and edges — will actually look. Take 
a peek at Color Plate 21 for an idea of what styles can do.
I’ve dedicated the second half of this chapter to SketchUp’s Shadows feature. 
Displaying shadows is an easy operation; it’s a matter of clicking a single 
button. Adding shadows to your model views offers lots of ways to make 
them look more realistic, more accurate, and more readable. And, well, more 
delicious. You’ll see what I mean.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Changing Your Model’s Appearance 
with Styles
This section provides a complete rundown of how to use styles in SketchUp 
7. First off, I talk about why you’d want to use styles in the first place. With so 
many options, I go into how you can avoid what I call stylesitis — an inflam-
mation of your styles related to getting stuck trying to decide how to make 
your model look.
Choosing how and where to apply styles
The thing to remember about styles is that they’re endless. With a million 
permutations of dozens of settings, you could spend all day fiddling with the 
way your model looks. I’ve found that keeping one question in mind — Does 
this setting help my model say what I want it to say? — helps me to focus on 
what’s important. There’s no doubt styles are cool, but making them useful is 
the key to keeping them under control.
To help you make smart decisions about using SketchUp styles, you should 
consider at least two factors when you’re “styling” your model:
 
✓ The subject of your model’s “level of completeness”: I like to reserve 
sketchy styles for models that are still evolving. The message this sends 
is “this isn’t permanent/I’m open to suggestions/all of this can change 
if it has to.” As my design gets closer to its final form, the appearance 
of my model generally gets less rough and more polished. I use styles 
to communicate how much input my audience can have and what deci-
sions still need to be made.
 
✓ How much your audience knows about design: When it comes to how 
styles are perceived, there’s a big difference between an architecture-
school jury and a nondesigner client who’s building a house for the 
first time. Design professionals are more experienced at understanding 
3D objects from 2D representations, so they don’t need as many visual 
clues to help them along. The essence of styles is really to provide these 
clues, so here’s a rule of thumb: The more your audience knows about 
design, the simpler you should keep your styles.
Before you dive in to styles, remember also that a little style goes a long way. 
No matter how tempting it is to go hog-wild with the styles settings, please 
resist the urge. Remember that the purpose of styles is to help your model 
communicate and not to make it look “pretty” or “cool.” If the style of your 
work is getting noticed more than its content, tone things down. Figure 9-1 
shows an example of going overboard with styles and then reining things in.

251
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
Figure 9-1: 
Abusing 
styles is 
altogether 
too easy.
 
Applying styles to your models
The easiest way to get started with styles is to apply the premade styles that 
come with SketchUp. You find scads of them, which is great, because seeing 
what’s been done is the best way to see what’s possible. As you go through 
this section, you’ll no doubt get ideas for your own styles, and that’s where 
the fun begins.
 
Applying a SketchUp style to your model is a four-step process, and it goes 
like this:
 
1. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles dialog box.
 
2. Click the Select tab to make sure that you’re looking at the Select 
pane.
 
3. Choose a styles collection from the Styles Collections drop-down list.
 
 I introduce you to the collections that come preinstalled with SketchUp 
7 in a moment.
 
4. Click a style in the Styles window to apply it to your model.
 
This may come as a surprise, but it’s not possible to view your model without 
any style at all. This is because styles are really just combinations of display 
settings; some styles are fancier than others, but no matter what you do, you 
always have to have a style applied. If you want to get a relatively neutral view 
of your model, I suggest choosing from the selection in the Default Styles 
collection.
One of the best things about SketchUp is that you’re rarely left out in the 
cold when it comes to content. Whether it’s styles, components, or materi-
als, SketchUp comes with plenty of examples to get you started. Figure 9-2 is 
a shot of the Styles Collections drop-down list you’ll see when SketchUp 7 is 
new out of the box. 

252
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Styles 
Collections 
drop-down 
list is where 
you’ll find all 
your styles.
 
Here’s some information about the most interesting ones:
 
✓ In Model: The In Model collection shows you all the styles you’ve 
applied to your model. It keeps track of every style you’ve ever applied 
to your model, whether that style is still applied or not. To see a current 
list of styles in your SketchUp file:
 
1. Choose the In Model styles collection to show a list of styles 
you’ve applied to your model.
 
2. Click the Details flyout menu and choose Purge Unused to get rid 
of any styles you aren’t currently using.
 
✓ Default Styles: Think basic. With the exception of the first one (which 
is the default style for all new SketchUp files you create), these styles 
are as minimal as it gets: white background, black edges, white-and-gray 
front-and-back faces, and no fancy edge effects. I use these styles to get 
back to a clean starting point for all my models; I like to start simple and 
build from there.
 
✓ Sketchy Edges: The Sketchy Edges styles in SketchUp 7 are the result of 
more than a year’s work on something called nonphotorealistic render-
ing (see the nearby sidebar, “Running from realism: NPR styles,” for the 
whole story). Basically, the miracle (okay, technological innovation) 
involves using real hand-drawn lines instead of digital ones to render 
edges. The result is that you can make your models look more like 
manual sketches than ever before. Before SketchUp 6, this effect has 
always looked unbelievably cheesy on the computer, like an anxious 
robot trying too hard to seem human. Not anymore, though. You can 
safely use the Sketchy Edges styles to convey any of the following:
 
• That your design is in process
 
• That your model is a proposal and not a finished product
 
• That you welcome feedback in any and all forms

253
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
Editing and saving your styles
If you’re handy in the kitchen, you’ve probably heard the saying that cooking 
is an art and baking is a science. Cooking allows you to experiment — adding 
a little of this and a dash of that while you’re making a sauce won’t wreck 
anything. When it comes to baking, taking liberties with a recipe can be a 
train wreck. What was supposed to be a cake can easily turn into a doorstop. 
I found this out when I made a lovely chocolate doorstop for my girlfriend’s 
birthday not so long ago. . . .
Running from realism: NPR styles
In the world of 3D modeling software, the trend 
has been toward photorealism. Rays of digital 
light are bounced around a billion times inside 
your computer until you can see every glint of 
sunlight in every dewdrop on every blade of 
grass on the lawn. The standard of perfection 
is how close the model comes to looking like a 
photograph, and in a lot of cases, that standard 
has been met — I’ve seen computer renderings 
that look more lifelike than life itself.
But what about models of buildings or other 
things that aren’t completely finished? Perhaps 
you’re an architect who’s designing a house 
for a client. If you aren’t sure what kind of tile 
you’ll end up using on your roof, how are you 
supposed to make a photorealistic rendering 
of it? You could just go ahead and throw any 
old tile up there as a placeholder, but that could 
backfire. Your client could hate the tile and 
decide not to hire you without ever telling you 
why, and all because of something you didn’t 
even choose.
What you need is a way to show only the deci-
sions you’ve made so far, and that is exactly why 
architects and other designers make sketches 
instead of photorealistic renderings. When 
you’re designing, decisions don’t all happen 
at once, so you need to be able to add detail 
as your design evolves. Sketching allows you 
to do that because it offers a continuum from 
“cartoony” to photographic, with everything in 
between. The following figure is an illustration 
of this.
Programs like SketchUp offer what’s called 
NPR, or nonphotorealistic rendering, as a way 
to solve this problem for people who design in 
3D. Instead of spending processor power on 
making representations that look like photo-
graphs, the people who make SketchUp went 
in the opposite direction; they’ve made a tool 
that lets you make drawings that are useful 
throughout the design process. And because 
SketchUp’s NPR engine works in real time, you 
can make changes on the fly, in front of your 
audience.

254
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Luckily, making your own styles has a lot more in common with cooking than 
it does with baking. Go ahead and fiddle around; you can’t do any irreversible 
harm. Playing with styles doesn’t affect the geometry in your model in any 
way, and because styles are just combinations of settings, you can always go 
back to the way things were before you started.
Of the three panes in the Styles dialog box, Edit is definitely the blue whale 
of the group. You find more controls and settings here than you can shake 
a stick at, so SketchUp’s designers broke the Edit pane up into five sections. 
Here’s a short description of each:
 
✓ Edge: The Edge section contains all the controls that affect the appear-
ance of edges in your model. This includes their visibility, their color, 
and other special effects you can apply.
 
✓ Face: This section controls the appearance of faces in your model, 
including their default colors, their visibility, and their transparency.
 
✓ Background: The Background section has controls for setting the color 
and visibility of the background, the sky, and the ground plane in your 
model.
 
✓ Watermark: These are images that you can use as backgrounds or as 
overlays. The Watermark section gives you control over these.
 
✓ Modeling: The Modeling section provides controls for setting the color 
and visibility of a bunch of elements in your model, including section 
planes and guides.
The following sections explain each part of the Edit pane in detail; I also pro-
vide suggestions for using some of the settings.
Introducing Style Builder
If you’re using the Pro version of SketchUp 7, 
you have access to a brand-new tool called 
Style Builder. It’s a completely separate appli-
cation (just like LayOut) that is put on your com-
puter when you install SketchUp Pro 7.
Style Builder lets you create NPR styles based 
on edges you draw. Yep, that’s right — you 
can make your SketchUp models look like 
you drew them by hand with your medium of 
choice (finger paint, Sharpie, bloody knife . . . ). 
All you need is a scanner and a piece of soft-
ware like Photoshop, and you’ll be good to go. 
The best thing about the styles you create with 
Style Builder is that they’re completely unique. 
Unless you share them with someone else, no 
one will ever be able to make SketchUp models 
that look like yours.
Because Style Builder is a whole other pro-
gram, and because it’s only included in the Pro 
version of SketchUp, this is all I’ll say about it in 
this book. Take a look at this book’s Web site for 
lots more information, though — if you’ve got it, 
Style Builder is too cool to ignore.

255
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
Tweaking edge settings
The Edge section is tricky because it changes a little bit depending on what 
kind of style you currently have applied to your model. NPR styles have dif-
ferent settings than regular, non-NPR styles. Figure 9-3 shows both versions 
of the Edge section, which you open by choosing Window➪Styles, selecting 
the Edit tab, and then clicking the box icon on the far left.
 
Figure 9-3: 
The Edge 
section 
comes in 
two flavors: 
regular and 
NPR.
 
Regular
NPR
 
SketchUp 7 comes with two different kinds of styles: regular and NPR. NPR 
stands for nonphotorealistic rendering, wherein SketchUp uses digitized, hand-
drawn lines to render the edges in your model. All the styles in the Sketchy 
Edges collection, as well as all the ones in the Assorted Styles collection, are 
NPR styles. Because you can create your own styles based on existing ones, all 
the styles you create using Edge settings from one of these NPR styles is an 
NPR style, too.
Here’s the lowdown on some of the less-obvious settings in the Edge section; 
check out Figure 9-4 for a visual reference:
 
✓ Profiles: Selecting the Profiles check box tells SketchUp to use a thicker 
line for edges that outline shapes in your model. Using profile lines is a 
pretty standard drawing convention that’s been around for a long time. I 
think SketchUp looks better with Profiles on, but I always have mine dialed 
down to 2 pixels; 3 pixels (which is the default) seems too beefy to me. 
 
✓ Depth Cue: Using different line thicknesses to convey depth is another 
drawing convention that’s popular. Objects closest to the viewer are 
drawn with the thickest lines, whereas the most distant things in the 
scene are drawn with the thinnest ones. 

256

Figure 9-4: 
Choose

tings to give 
your model 
the desired 
look, from 
realistic to 
sketchy.
 
 
 Depth Cue is SketchUp’s automatic way of letting you apply this effect 
to your models. When its check box is selected, Depth Cue dynamically 
assigns line thicknesses (draftspersons call them line weights) accord-
ing to how far away from you things are in your model. The number you 
type in is both your desired number of line weights and the thickness of 
the fattest line SketchUp will use. I like to use a maximum line weight of 
5 or 6 pixels.
 
 One more thing: When I’m using Depth Cue, I turn off Profiles. I don’t 
think these two drawing conventions work well together, so I always 
choose to use one or the other.

257
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ Halo: I really wish Halo were available for non-NPR styles because it’s 
just that great. What Halo does is very simple: It automatically ends cer-
tain lines before they run into other ones, creating a halo of empty space 
around objects in the foreground. This keeps your model looking neat 
and easy to read. In fact, this is a drawing trick that pencil-and-paper 
users have been using forever to convey depth; look closely at most car-
toons and you’ll see what I mean.
 
 The number you type into the Halo box represents the amount of 
breathing room SketchUp gives your edges. The unit of measure is 
pixels, but there’s no real science to it; just play with the number until 
things look right to you. For what it’s worth, I like to crank it up. 
 
✓ Level of Detail: When you slide the Level of Detail controller (which 
only appears when you’ve applied an NPR style) back and forth, you’re 
effectively telling SketchUp how busy you want your model to look. The 
farther to the right you slide it, the more of your edges SketchUp dis-
plays. You should experiment with this setting to see what looks best 
for your model. Figure 9-8 shows what happens when I slide the Level of 
Detail controller from left to right.
 
✓ Color: You use the Color drop-down list to tell SketchUp what color 
to use for all the edges in your model. Here’s what each of the options 
means:
 
• All Same: This tells SketchUp to use the same color for all the 
edges in your model. You tell it what color to use by clicking the 
color well on the right and choosing a color.
 
• By Material: Choosing this causes your model’s edges to take on 
the color of whatever material they’re painted with. Because most 
people don’t know that you can paint edges different colors, this 
doesn’t get used very often.
 
• By Axis: Now here’s a useful, but hidden, gem. Choosing to color 
your edges by axis tells SketchUp to make everything that’s paral-
lel to one of the colored axes the color of that axis. Edges that 
aren’t parallel to any of them stay black. Why is this so important? 
When something is screwy with your model — faces won’t extrude, 
or lines won’t sink in — switching your edge colors to By Axis is 
the first thing you should do. You’ll be surprised how many of your 
edges aren’t what they seem. Have a look at Chapter 15 for more 
about this.
Changing the way faces look
The Face section of the Styles dialog box is very simple — at least compared 
to the Edge section (what isn’t, really?). This area of the SketchUp user inter-
face controls the appearance of faces, or surfaces, in your model. From here, 
you can affect their color, visibility, and translucency. Figure 9-5 shows the 

258
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Face section in vivid grayscale, and you can open it by choosing Window➪
Styles, selecting the Edit tab, and clicking the box icon that’s second from the 
left. The following sections describe each of the elements in detail.

In SketchUp, every face you create has a back and a front. You can choose 
what colors to use by default for all new faces you create by clicking the 
Front and Back color wells and picking a color. I recommend sticking with 
neutral tones for your defaults; you can always paint individual faces later on.
 
Sometimes when you’re modeling in SketchUp, a face will be turned “inside 
out.” Follow these steps to flip a face around so that the right side is showing:
 
1. Select the face you want to flip.
 
2. Right-click and choose Reverse Faces.
 
Knowing which face is the front and which is the back is especially important if 
you plan to export your model to another program. Some of these, like 3D 
Studio Max, use the distinction between front and back to make important dis-
tinctions about what to display. In these cases, showing the wrong side of a 
face can end up producing unexpected results. I talk more about this in Part IV.
Style
Even though these are called Face styles, they have nothing to do with Styles, 
the SketchUp feature that half of this chapter is about. Face styles might as 
well be called Face modes because that’s what they are: different modes for 
viewing the faces in your model. You can flip between them as much as you 
like without affecting your geometry. Each one has its purpose, and all are 
shown in Figure 9-6:

259
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ Wireframe: In Wireframe mode, your faces are invisible. Because you 
can’t see them, you can’t affect them. Only your edges are visible, which 
makes this mode handy for doing two things:
 
• When you’re selecting edges, switch to Wireframe mode to make 
sure that you’ve selected what you meant to select. Because no 
faces block your view, this is the best way to make sure that you’re 
getting only what you want.
 
• After you’ve used Intersect with Model, you usually have stray 
edges lying around. Wireframe is the quickest way to erase them 
because you can see what you’re doing. See Chapter 4 for details 
on Intersect with Model.
In a fog?
If you’re looking for something to provide a 
sense of depth in your model views, look no fur-
ther than the Fog feature. New for this version 
of SketchUp, Fog does exactly what it says — it 
makes your model look like it’s enshrouded in 
fog (see the accompanying figure). You’d think 
that a feature this neat would be a little compli-
cated, but it’s the opposite. Follow these three 
steps to let the fog roll into your model:
 1. Choose Window➪Fog to open the Fog 
dialog box.
 2. Select the Display Fog check box to turn on 
the fog effect.
 3. Fool around with the controls until you like 
what you see.
I wish the process of controlling how Fog looks 
was more scientific, but I’m afraid it’s not. You 
just play around with the sliders until you have 
the amount of fog you want. But just in case you 
absolutely need to know, here’s what the slid-
ers do:
 ✓ Top slider (0%): This controls the point in 
space at which Fog begins to appear in 
your model. When it’s all the way to the 
right (toward infinity), you can’t see any 
fog.
 ✓ Bottom slider (100%): This controls the point 
in space at which the fog is completely 
opaque. As you move the slider from left to 
right, you’re moving the “completely invis-
ible” point farther away.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
Figure 9-6: 
Face styles 
should be 
called Face 
modes; 
use them 
to change 
the way 
your faces 
appear.
 
 
✓ Hidden Line: Hidden Line mode displays all your faces using whatever 
color you’re using for the background; it’s really as simple as that. If 
you’re trying to make a clean, black-and-white line drawing that looks 
like a technical illustration, make your background white. (I talk about 
how later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Shaded: This Face style displays your faces with colors on them. Faces 
painted with a solid color appear that color. Faces to which you’ve added 
textures are shown with a color that best approximates their overall 
color. If your texture has a lot of brown in it, SketchUp picks a brown and 
uses that. For models with a lot of these textures, switching to Shaded 
mode can really speed up orbiting, zooming, and otherwise navigating 
around. Unless I absolutely need to see textures I’ve applied to my faces, 
I tend to stay in Shaded mode whenever I’m working on my model.

261
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ Shaded with Textures: Use Shaded with Textures when you want to see 
your model with textures visible. Because this mode puts a lot of strain 
on your computer, it can also be the slowest mode to work in. I only 
turn it on when I’m working on a small model, or when I need to see the 
textures I’ve applied to my faces. Obviously, if you’re going for a photo-
realistic effect, this is the mode to choose. It’s also the mode that best 
approximates what your model will look like when (and if) you export it 
to Google Earth.
 
✓ Display Shaded Using All Same: When you want to quickly give your 
model a simplified color scheme, use this Face style; it uses your default 
front and back face colors to paint your model. You can also use this 
setting to check the orientation of your faces if you’re exporting your 
model to another piece of 3D software.
 
✓ X-Ray: Unlike using translucent materials on only some of your faces 
(like glass and water), flipping on X-Ray lets you see through all your 
faces. I tend to use it when I want to see through a wall or a floor to 
show what’s behind it. If you’re in a plan (overhead) view, it’s a great 
way to demonstrate how a floor level relates to the one below it.
Transparency
Because how well SketchUp runs on your computer depends on what’s in 
your model, and because displaying transparency (as in translucent materi-
als) is an especially taxing operation for SketchUp and your computer to 
handle, you can decide how to display translucent materials:
 
✓ Enable transparency: Deselect this check box to display translu-
cent materials as opaque. You should turn off transparency to speed 
SketchUp’s performance if you find that it’s slowed down.
 
✓ Transparency quality: If you decide to display transparency, you can 
further fine-tune your system’s performance by telling SketchUp how to 
render that transparency: You have the choice of better performance, 
nicer graphics, or an average of the two. 
Setting up the background
In the Background section of the Styles dialog box, you choose colors and 
decide whether you want to be able to see a sky and a ground plane. It 
doesn’t get less complicated than this, folks. Check out Figure 9-7 to get a 
view of the Background section, along with an idea of how it works. To open 
these options in your own copy of SketchUp, choose Window➪Styles, select 
the Edit tab, and click the middle icon, at the top of the tab. You have the fol-
lowing options in the Background section:
 
✓ Background: For most models, I set the background to white — I guess 
I’m a traditionalist.

262
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
✓ Sky: Choosing to display a sky in your modeling window makes things 
slightly more realistic, but the real purpose of this feature is to provide a 
point of reference for your model. In 3D views of big things like architec-
ture, it’s nice to be able to see the horizon. Another reason for turning 
on the sky is to set the mood — keep in mind that the sky isn’t always 
blue. I’ve seen some beautiful SketchUp renderings wherein the sky was 
sunset (or maybe nuclear winter) orange.
 
✓ Ground: I have to admit that I’m not a big fan of turning on the Ground 
feature, and here’s why: It’s very hard to find a ground color that looks 
halfway good, no matter what you’re building. I also don’t like the fact 
that you can’t dig into the earth to make sunken spaces (like courtyards) 
with the ground turned on. Instead of turning on this feature, I prefer to 
make my own ground planes with faces and edges. It’s more flexible, and 
I think it looks better.

section to

Working with watermarks
Watermarks are much easier to understand if you don’t think about them as 
actual watermarks. They’re not anything like watermarks, in fact — they’re 
much more useful. If I had to define them (and because I’m writing this book, 
I guess I do), I’d put it this way: Watermarks are graphics that you can apply 
either behind or in front of your model to produce certain effects. Here are a 
few of the things you can do with SketchUp watermarks:
 
✓ Simulate a paper texture, just like some of the styles in the Assorted 
Styles collection
 
✓ Apply a permanent logo or other graphic to your model view
 
✓ Layer a translucent or cutout image in the foreground to simulate look-
ing through a frosted window or binoculars

263
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ Add a photographic background like “Outer Space” or “Inside My Colon” 
to create a unique model setting
Eyeing the watermark controls
Figure 9-8 shows the Watermark section of the Styles dialog box. Here’s a 
brief introduction to what some of the less-obvious controls do:
 
Figure 9-8: 
The 
Watermark 
tab.
 
 
✓ Add, Remove, and Edit Watermark buttons: The +, -, and gears icons 
allow you to add, remove, and edit (respectively) watermarks in the 
style you’re editing.
 
✓ Watermark List: This list shows all your watermarks in relation to some-
thing called Model Space, which is the space occupied by your model. 
All watermarks are either in front of or behind your model, making them 
overlays or underlays, respectively.
 
✓ Move Up or Down arrows: Use these buttons to change the “stacking” 
order of the watermarks in your model view. Select the watermark you 
want to move in the list and then click one of these buttons to move it 
up or down in the order.
Adding a watermark
 
Watermarks are by no means simple, but working with them, miraculously 
enough, is. Follow these steps to add a watermark to your model view:
 
1. Click the Add Watermark button to begin the process of adding a 
watermark.
 
 The Open dialog box appears.

264
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
2. Find the image you want to use as a watermark and then click the 
Open button to open the first Choose Watermark dialog box (see 
Figure 9-9).
 
 You can use any of these graphics file formats: TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
 
 This is way beyond the scope of this book, but I think it’s worth men-
tioning because you’re bound to need this sooner or later: If you want to 
make a watermark out of an image that isn’t a solid rectangle (like a 
logo), you need to use a graphics file format, like PNG or GIF, that sup-
ports alpha channels. An alpha channel is an extra layer of information 
in a graphics file that describes which areas of your image are supposed 
to be transparent. It sounds complicated, but it’s really a straightfor-
ward concept. To make an image with an alpha channel, you need a 
piece of software like Photoshop or GIMP. Try searching for alpha chan-
nels on Google for more information.
 
Figure 9-9: 
The Choose 
Watermark 
series of 
dialog 
boxes.
 

265
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
3. Type in a name for your watermark in the Name box.
 
4. Choose whether you want your new watermark to be in the back-
ground or in the foreground as an overlay and click the Next button.
 
5. Decide whether to use your watermark as a mask.
 
 Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to make your watermark trans-
parent, which kind of simulates a real watermark. How transparent each 
part becomes is based on how bright it is. White is the brightest color, 
so anything white in your watermark becomes completely transparent. 
Things that are black turn your background color, and everything in 
between turns a shade of your background color. The possibilities for 
this feature are interesting, but I haven’t found any good uses for it yet. 
 
6. Adjust the amount that your watermark blends with what’s behind it, 
and click the Next button.
 
 In this case, Blend is really just a synonym for Transparency. By sliding 
the Blend slider back and forth, you can adjust the transparency of your 
watermark.
 
 Blend comes in handy for making paper textures because that process 
involves using the same watermark twice: once as an overlay and once 
as an underlay. The overlay version gets “blended” in so that your 
model appears to be drawn on top of it. To see how this works, apply 
one of the Paper Texture styles to your model, and then edit each of the 
watermarks to check out its settings.
 
7. Decide how you want your watermark to be displayed and then click 
the Finish button.
 
 You have three choices for how SketchUp can display your watermark: 
stretched to fit the entire window, tiled across the window, and posi-
tioned in the window. If you select Stretched to Fit the Entire Window, 
be sure to select the Locked Aspect Ratio check box if your watermark is 
a logo that you don’t want to appear distorted.
Editing a watermark
You can edit any watermark in your SketchUp file at any time. Follow these 
simple steps to edit a watermark:
 
1. Select the watermark you want to edit in the Watermark list.
 
 You can find the Watermark list on the Watermark tab, in the Edit pane 
of the Styles dialog box.
 
2. Click the Edit Watermark button to open the Edit Watermark dialog box.
 
3. Use the controls in the Edit Watermark dialog box and click the OK 
button when you’re done.
 
 For a complete description of the controls in this dialog box, see the pre-
vious section in this chapter.

266
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Tweaking modeling settings
All you need to know about the controls in the Modeling section (see Figure 
9-10) of the Styles dialog box is that there’s not much to know. You use the 
controls to adjust the color and visibility of all the elements of your model 
that aren’t geometry. To open these options, choose Window➪Styles, select 
the Edit tab, and click the box icon on the far right, at the top of the tab. The 
controls are described as follows:
 
Figure 9-10: 
The con-
trols in the 
Modeling 
section are 
every bit as 
simple as 
they look.
 
 
✓ Controls with color wells: Click the wells to change the color of that 
type of element.
 
✓ Section cut width: This refers to the thickness of the lines, in pixels, that 
make up the section cut when you’re using a section plane. For more 
about this, have a look at the information on cutting sections in Chapter 
10.
 
✓ Controls with check boxes: Use these to control the visibility of that 
type of element in your model. Three of them are a little confusing:
 
• Color by Layer: Tells SketchUp to color your geometry accord-
ing to the colors you’ve set up in the Layers dialog box. Check out 
Chapter 7 for more on this.
 
• Section Planes: This refers to the section plane objects that you 
use to cut sections. They’re gray with four arrows on their corners.
 
• Section Cuts: Unlike section planes, this setting controls the vis-
ibility of the section cut effect itself. With this deselected, your sec-
tion planes won’t appear to be cutting anything.

267
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
Mixing styles to create new ones
You can use the Mix pane to combine features of multiple styles in order to 
make new ones. Instead of working through the sections of the Edit pane, flip-
ping controls on and off, sliding sliders, and picking colors, the Mix pane lets 
you build new styles by dropping existing ones onto special “category” wells. 
In addition to being a nifty way to work, this is the only way you can switch a 
style’s edge settings between NPR and non-NPR lines.
 
NPR refers to the styles in the Assorted Styles, Sketchy Edges, and 
Competition Winners collections. These nonphotorealistic rendering styles 
use scanned, hand-drawn lines to draw the edges in your model. If you have 
SketchUp Pro, you can use Style Builder to make your own NPR styles from 
lines you draw and scan in yourself. Take a look at the sidebar “Introducing 
Style Builder” for more information.
Follow these steps to change a style using the Mix pane (see Figure 9-11):
 
1. Choose Window➪Styles and click the Mix tab in the Styles dialog box 
to open the Mix pane.
 
 As part of the Mix pane, the secondary selection pane opens at the 
bottom of the dialog box. This provides you with a way to view your 
styles without having to switch from the Mix pane to the Select one.
 
2. Find the style you want to sample from in the secondary selection 
pane. You can call this your source style.
 
 Say that you’re working on a new style, and you want your edges to 
look just like those in the Marker Loose style that came with SketchUp. 
In this example, choose the Sketchy Edges collection from the Styles 
Collections drop-down list, where you’ll find the Marker Loose style.
 
3. Windows users: Click the source style from the Styles list in the sec-
ondary selection pane to sample it and then click the category well 
that corresponds to the style setting you want to apply.
 
 Mac users: Drag your source style from the Styles list in the secondary 
selection pane to the category well that corresponds to the style set-
ting you want to apply.
 
 In this case, sample the Marker Loose style from the secondary selection 
pane and drop it on the Edge Settings Category well because you want 
the edge settings from that style to be applied to the style you’re work-
ing on.
 
4. To save your style after you’re done adding all the bits and pieces, see 
the following section.

Saving and sharing styles you make
As you’re working along in SketchUp, you’ll want to create your own styles. 
You’ll also want to save those styles so that you can use them in other 
models. If you’re part of a team, it’s likely that everyone will want to have 
access to the same styles so that all your models look consistent.
Saving the styles you’ve made
When it comes to creating your own styles, you can approach things in two 
different ways. Each of these ways gets its own button (see Figure 9-12):
 
✓ Create new style: Clicking this button creates a new style with the set-
tings you currently have active. When you create a new style, it shows 
up in your In Model collection of styles and is saved with your model. 
The Create button can be found in the upper-right corner of the dialog 
box, and looks like a couple of objects with a “+” sign on it.
 
✓ Update style with changes: This button updates the current style with 
any settings changes you’ve made in the Edit or Mix panes. If you want 
to modify an existing style without creating a new one, this is the way 
to go. You can find the Update button right below the Create button in 
the upper-right corner of the dialog box; it looks like two arrows chasing 
each other around in a circle.

269
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
Figure 9-12:

and Create

Update Style with Changes
Create New Style
Updating an existing style
To make adjustments to a style in your model, you need to update it. Follow 
these steps to update a style:
 
1. Apply the style you want to update to your model.
 
 If you need help with this, follow the steps in the section, “Applying 
Styles to Your Models,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Use the controls in the Edit pane to make changes to the style.
 
3. Click the Update Style with Changes button in the Styles dialog box to 
update the style with your changes.
 
You use the Update Style with Changes button to rename existing styles, too. 
Just type the new name into the Name box (at the top of the Styles dialog 
box), press Enter, and then click the Update button.
 
When you update a style, only the copy of the style that’s saved with your 
model is updated. You aren’t altering the copy of the style that shows up in 
every new SketchUp file you create.
Creating a new style
Creating a new style adds it to your In Model collection of styles, which 
means that you can come back and apply it to your model anytime you like. 
Follow these steps to create a new style:
 
1. Click the Create New Style button in the Styles dialog box.

270
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
 This duplicates the style that was applied to your model before you 
clicked the Create New Style button. Your new style appears in your In 
Model collection as [name of the original style]1.
 
2. Use the controls in the Edit pane to set up your style the way you want.
 
 Frequently, you’ll want to make a new style after you’ve already made 
changes to an existing one. If you want to create a new style that reflects 
modifications you’ve already made, just switch Steps 1 and 2 around.
 
3. Use the Name box (at the top of the Styles dialog box) to give your 
new style a name and press Enter.
 
 If you want, you can also give your new style a description in the 
Description box, though you might want to wait until later. After all, it’s 
hard to describe something you haven’t made yet.
 
4. Click the Update button.
 
 This updates your new style with all the changes you made in Steps 2 
and 3.
 
5. Check the In Model collection in the Select pane to make sure that 
your new style is there.
 
 Click the In Model button (which looks like a little house) to see your In 
Model Styles collection. Your new style should appear alphabetically in 
the list.
 
If a bunch of styles exist in your In Model collection that you aren’t using any-
more and you want to clean things up, right-click the Details flyout menu and 
choose Purge Unused. This gets rid of any styles that aren’t currently applied 
to any scenes in your model. Have a look at Chapter 10 to find out more about 
scenes.
 
Creating a new style doesn’t automatically make it available for use in other 
SketchUp files. To find out how to do this, keep reading.
Using your styles in other models
 
After you’ve updated or created a style, you’ll probably want to make that 
style available in other SketchUp models. To make this happen, you need to 
be able to create your own styles collections. Collections are folders on your 
computer that contain the styles that show up in the Styles dialog box. You 
can create your own collections to keep the styles you invent neat and tidy.
Follow these steps to create a collection to contain your styles:
 
1. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles dialog box.

271
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
2. Click the Select tab to make sure that you’re looking at the Select pane.
 
3. Click the Details flyout menu and choose Create a new collection.
 
 This opens the Add New Collection dialog box.
 
4. Navigate to the folder on your computer or network where you would 
like to create your collection.
 
 You can locate your new collection anywhere you like, but I recom-
mend putting it in the same folder as the other styles collections on 
your computer:
 
• Windows: C:/Program Files/Google/Google SketchUp 7/Styles
 
• Mac: Hard Drive/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 7/
SketchUp/Styles
 
5. Click Make New Folder if you’re on a Windows computer (New Folder 
on a Mac).
 
 The new folder you create becomes your new collection.
 
6. Type in a name for your new collection.
 
 Call your new collection “Josephine’s Collection.” You can call it some-
thing else if your name isn’t Josephine.
 
7. If you’re on a Mac, make sure that the Add to Favorites check box is 
checked.
 
8. Click the Save button.
 
 The Add New Collection dialog box closes, and your collection is added 
to the Favorites section of the Collections drop-down list. It will be there 
in every SketchUp model you open on this computer.
After you’ve created a new collection, you can add styles to it in order to 
make them available from any model you’re working on.
Follow these steps to make a style available for use in other SketchUp files:
 
1. Choose Window➪Styles.
 
 The Style dialog box appears. 
 
2. Click the Select tab.
 
3. Click the In Model button to display your In Model collection.
 
 The In Model button looks like a little house. The In Model collection 
contains all the styles you’ve used in your model, including the ones 
you’ve created.

272
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
4. Click the Show Secondary Selection Pane button.
 
 When you click this button, which looks like a black-and-white rectangle 
and is in the upper-right corner of the Styles dialog box, a second copy 
of the Select pane pops out of the bottom of the Styles dialog box (see 
Figure 9-13). You use this pane to drag and drop styles between folders 
on your computer, which makes it easier to keep them organized.
 
5. In the secondary selection pane, choose the collection to which you 
want to add your style.
 
Figure 9-13: 
Use the 
secondary 
selection 
pane to 
manage 
your styles 
without

SketchUp.
 
Show/Hide Secondary Pane
 
 If you’ve created a collection specifically for the styles you make, choose 
that one, or you can pick any of the collections in the Collections drop-
down list.
 
6. Drag your style from the In Model styles list to the Styles list in the 
secondary selection pane.
 
 By dragging and dropping your style from the upper list to the lower 
one, you’re making it available to anyone who has access to that collec-
tion. This means that you can use it in other SketchUp models you build 
on your computer. To share it with other members of your team, copy 
your style to a collection somewhere where other people can get to it, 
like on a network.

273
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
Working with Shadows
Typically, you add shadows to a SketchUp drawing for two key reasons:
 
✓ To display or print a model in a more realistic way: Turning on shadows 
adds depth and realism and gives your model an added level of complex-
ity that makes it look like you worked harder than you really did.
 
✓ To study the effect of the sun on what you’ve built (or plan to build) 
in a specific geographic location: Shadow studies are an integral part of 
the design of any built object. If you’re making a sunroom, you need to 
know that the sun is actually going to hit it, no? You can use SketchUp to 
show exactly how the sun will affect your creation, at every time of day, 
on every day of the year.
In this section, I start out with a brief, nuts-and-bolts description of how all 
the controls work, without diving too much into why you’d want to pick one 
setting instead of another. The second part of this section is devoted to run-
ning through each of the preceding scenarios and using the controls to make 
SketchUp do exactly what you want it to.
Discovering SketchUp’s Shadow Settings
The basic thing to understand about shadows in SketchUp is that, just like in 
real life, they’re controlled by changing the position of the sun. Because the 
sun moves exactly the same way every year, you just pick a date and time, 
and SketchUp automatically displays the correct shadows by figuring out 
where the sun should be. Hooray for math!
You do all these simple maneuvers in the Shadow Settings dialog box, shown 
in Figure 9-14. The sections that follow introduce how the controls work so 
you can apply to them to your model.
 
Figure 9-14: 
Dial up the 
sun in the 
Shadow 
Settings 
dialog box.
 

274
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Turning on the sun
Shadows aren’t on by default, so the first thing you need to know about 
applying shadows is how to turn them on. Follow these simple steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Shadows to display the Shadow Settings dialog box.
 
2. At the top of the dialog box, select the Display Shadows check box.
 
 Clicking it turns on the sun in SketchUp, casting shadows throughout 
your model and, generally speaking, making everything much more 
exciting.
Setting a shadow’s time and date
The Shadow Settings dialog box has time and date controls, which you use to 
change the position of the SketchUp sun. The time and date you choose, in 
turn, controls the appearance of shadows in your model:
 
✓ Setting the time: You don’t have to be Copernicus to figure out how to 
set the time of day; move the Time slider back and forth, or type a time 
into the little box on the right. Notice the little times at each end of the 
slider? These represent sunrise and sunset for the day of the year you’ve 
set in the Date control, described in the next point.
 
✓ Setting the date: Just like the time of day, you set the day of the year by 
moving the Date slider back and forth, or by typing in a date in the little 
box on the right. If you slide the Date control back and forth, notice that 
the sunrise and sunset times change in the Time control, in the previous 
point.
 
To toggle open or closed the extra shadow controls, click the triangular 
Expand button in the upper-right corner of the Shadow Settings dialog box.
Choosing where shadows are displayed
The Display check boxes in the Shadow Settings dialog box enable you to 
control where shadows are cast. Depending on your model, you may want to 
toggle these on or off.
 
✓ On Faces: Deselecting the On Faces check box means that shadows 
aren’t cast on faces in your model. This is on by default, and should 
probably be left on, unless you only want to cast shadows on the 
ground. For what it’s worth, I always have it selected.
 
✓ On Ground: Deselecting the On Ground check box causes shadows not 
to be cast on the ground plane. Again, this is on by default, but some-
times you’ll want to turn it off. A prime example of this is when some-
thing you’re building extends underground.

275
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ From Edges: Selecting the From Edges check box tells SketchUp to allow 
edges to cast shadows. This applies to single edges that are not associ-
ated with faces — things like ropes, poles, and sticks are often modeled 
with edges like these.
Using shadows to add depth and realism
The neat thing about shadows in SketchUp is how easily you can apply 
them — and how easy they are to adjust. In the previous sections, I give a 
dry rundown of the basic controls in the Shadow Settings dialog box. In the 
following sections, I show you how to use those controls to add depth, real-
ism, and delicious nuance to your models. If only Caravaggio had had it so 
good. . . .
There are lots of times when you’ll need to use shadows to make your draw-
ings read better; most of them fit into one of the following three categories:
 
✓ Indoor scenes: The sun is the only source of lighting that SketchUp has, 
so any shadows you use in interior views have to come from it.
 
✓ Objects that aren’t in any particular location: For things like cars and 
furniture, it doesn’t matter that the shadows are geographically accurate; 
all that matters it that they help make your model look good.
 
✓ 2D views: Without shadows, it’s next to impossible to read depth in 2D 
views of 3D space.
Lighting indoor spaces
Adding shadows to interior views presents an interesting problem: Because 
SketchUp has no lights besides the sun, how are you supposed to make any-
thing that looks halfway realistic? With a ceiling in your room, everything’s 
dark. If you leave off the ceiling, your model looks ridiculous. Don’t despair — 
here are some tricks I’ve learned:
 
✓ Decrease the darkness of the shadows. Sliding the Dark slider to the 
right brightens your view considerably. You’ll still be able to see the 
shadows cast by the sun coming through windows and other openings, 
but the whole room won’t look like something bad is about to happen. 
Check out Figure 9-15 to see what I mean.
 
✓ Make an impossible ceiling. As long as you haven’t modeled anything 
on top of the interior you’re planning to show, you can tell the ceiling 
not to cast a shadow. That way, sunlight will shine directly onto your 
furniture, casting gloriously complex shadows all over everything.

Figure 9-16 shows this ceiling method in action; follow these steps to do it 
yourself:
 
1. Adjust the settings in the Shadow Settings dialog box until the sun is 
shining through one or more windows in your view.
 
 This ensures that shadows cast by objects in your room look like they’re 
caused by light from the windows.

277
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
Figure 9-16: 
Tell the 
ceiling not 
to cast a 
shadow.
 
 
 To make it seem like overhead lighting is in your space, set the time of 
day to about noon. The shadows cast by furniture and similar objects 
will be directly below the objects themselves. One more thing: If you 
have lighting fixtures on the ceiling, remember to set them not to cast 
shadows in the Entity Info dialog box (read on).
 
2. Choose Window➪Entity Info.
 
 This opens the Entity Info dialog box.
 
3. Select any faces that make up the ceiling.
 
 Hold down Shift to select more than one thing at a time.
 
4. In the Entity Info dialog box, deselect the Cast Shadows check box.
 
 The ceiling now no longer casts a shadow, brightening your space 
considerably.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the following faces and objects:
 
• The wall with the windows in it
 
• The windows themselves
 
• Any walls in your view that are casting shadows on the floor of 
your space
 
6. Move the Dark slider over to about 50.
 
 This brightens things even more and makes your shadows more 
believable.

278
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Making 3D objects pop
Adding shadows to freestanding things like tables and lamps and pineapples 
is a mostly aesthetic undertaking; just fiddle with the controls until things 
look good to you, and you’ll be okay. Here are some things (which are illus-
trated in Figure 9-17) to keep in mind:
 
Figure 9-17: 
Some 
tips make 
objects 
stand out 
with 
shadows.
 
 
✓ Take it easy on the contrast — especially when it comes to very com-
plex shapes or faces with photos mapped to them. When your model is 
too contrasty and dramatic, it can be hard to figure out what’s going on. 
To decrease the contrast:
 
1. Move the Dark slider over to about 55.
 
2. Move the Light slider down to 60 or 70.
 
✓ Shorten your shadows. It’s strange to see objects lit as though the light 
source is very far away; overhead lighting looks more natural. To make 
your shadows look better, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the Date slider to a day in the early autumn.
 
2. Set the Time slider to a time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to rotate your model around. Remember that you can’t 
get every possible shadow position by using only the controls in the 
Shadow Settings dialog box; to get the effect you want, you might have 
to rotate your model by selecting it and using the Rotate tool.

279
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
✓ Select the From Edges check box. Lots of times, modelers use free 
edges to add fine detail to models (think of a harp or a loom). Selecting 
the From Edges check box tells SketchUp to allow those edges to cast 
shadows, which makes complex objects look about 900 percent cooler.
 
✓ Pay attention to the transparency of faces. When you have a face 
painted with a transparent material, you can decide whether that face 
should cast a shadow — chances are that it shouldn’t. In SketchUp, the 
rule is that materials that are more than 50 percent transparent cast 
shadows. So, if you don’t want one of your transparent-looking faces to 
cast a shadow, do one of the following:
 
• Select the face, and then deselect the Cast Shadows check box in 
the Entity Info dialog box.
 
• Adjust the opacity of the face’s material to be less than 50 percent 
in the Materials dialog box. For more information on how to do 
this, have a look at Chapter 2.
Creating accurate shadow studies
One of the most useful features in SketchUp is the ability to display accurate 
shadows. To do this, three pieces of information are necessary:
 
✓ The time of day
 
✓ The day of the year
 
✓ The latitude of the building site
 
The sun’s position (and thus the position of shadows) depends on geographic 
location — that is to say, latitude. The shadow cast by a building at 3:00 on 
March 5 in Minsk is very different from that cast by a similar building, at the 
same time of day, on the same date in Nairobi.
If you’re displaying shadows on a model of a toaster oven, geographic loca-
tion probably doesn’t matter to you; the shadows are just there for effect. But 
if you’re trying to see how much time your pool deck will spend in the sun 
during the summer months, you need to tell SketchUp where you are.
Telling SketchUp where you are
How many of us know the precise latitude of where we live? I sure don’t. It’s a 
good thing SketchUp makes it easy to tell it where in the world your model is 
supposed to be. You can georeference your model (give it a geographic loca-
tion) in two ways; which one you choose will probably depend on whether 
you have an Internet connection handy:

280
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
✓ Using Google Earth: This is by far the simplest approach, but it requires 
that you have a precise idea of where your model is supposed to be on 
the globe. Because it involves Google Earth, it also requires that you be 
connected to the Internet for the operation. If you know exactly where 
your model is supposed to go, and you’re online, use this method. Take 
a look at the section “Building Models for Google Earth” in Chapter 11 
for a complete set of instructions.
 
✓ Using the Model Info dialog box: This method is a little more compli-
cated, but it’s your only option if you’re not online (or if you’d rather not 
use Google Earth). Read on for all the gory details.
To give your model a geographic location without using Google Earth, follow 
these steps (see Figure 9-18):
 
Figure 9-18: 
Giving your 
model a 
geographic 
location.
 
 
1. Somewhere on the ground in your model, draw a short line to indicate 
the direction of north.
 
 You might already have a north indicator if you’re working with 
imported geometry (from AutoCAD, for instance).
 
2. Choose Window➪Model Info to open the Model Info dialog box.
 
3. On the left side of the Model Info dialog box, choose Location.

281
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
 If the Use Georeferencing check box is selected and the Country and 
Location drop-down lists say N/A or Custom, stop here. Your model has 
already been geographically located and you don’t need to go through 
any of the following steps. Close the Model Info dialog box, make your-
self some coffee, and waste the time you just saved avoiding the next 
seven steps.
 
4. Choose a country from the Country drop-down list.
 
5.  Choose a location from the Location drop-down list.
 
 If the location you want isn’t listed, choose the closest one, or click the 
Custom Location button to enter a set of coordinates.
 
 To find coordinates for just about anywhere in the world, try searching 
for city, country coordinates on Google; something usually pops up.
 
6. Click the Select button to the right of the North angle box.
 
 Do this instead of typing in a north angle (which I find overly compli-
cated). Back in your model window, your cursor will have become a 
biggish circle with four lines radiating out from the center, as shown in 
Figure 9-19.
 
7.  Click the southern end of the line you drew in Step 1.
 
Figure 9-19: 
Telling 
SketchUp 
where 
north is.
 

282
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
8.  Click the northern end of the same line, finishing the operation.
 
9.  If you want, select the Show in Model check box to display the direc-
tion of north as a yellow line.
 
10. Close the Model Info dialog box.
 
 The shadows in SketchUp are now specific to the geographic location 
you’ve just set up. If you like, you can erase the line you drew in Step 1.
Displaying accurate shadows for a given time and place
Now that you’ve told SketchUp where your model is, it’s a pretty simple pro-
cess to study how the sun will affect your project, as shown in Figure 9-20. 
This is the fun part; all you have to do is move some sliders around. If you 
have an audience, get ready for some completely undeserved praise.
 
Figure 9-20: 
Studying the 
effect of the 
sun on your 
model.
 
To study how the sun will affect your project, follow these steps:
 
1. Orbit, zoom, and pan around until you have a good view of the part of 
your project you want to study.
 
2. Choose Window➪Shadows to open the Shadow Settings dialog box.
 
3.  Select the Display Shadows check box to turn on SketchUp’s sun.

283
 Chapter 9: Working with Styles and Shadows
 
4.  Type a month and day into the box to the right of the Date slider, and 
press Enter.
 
5. Move the Time slider back and forth to see how the shadows will 
move over the course of that day.
 
6. Pick a time of day using the Time controls.
 
7. Move the Date slider back and forth to see how the sun will affect 
your project at that time of day over the course of the year.
Uses for shadows
Even if you’re not an architect, you might want 
to study shadows accurately for these reasons:
 ✓ To figure out where to locate the plants in 
your garden that need the most light (or the 
most shade)
 ✓ To see when sunlight will be coming 
straight through the skylight you’re thinking 
of installing
 ✓ To make sure that the overhang behind 
your house will provide enough shade at 
lunchtime in the summer
 ✓ To plan and build a 50-foot stone sundial as 
a birthday gift for your Druidic neighbor

Chapter 10
Presenting Your Model 
Inside SketchUp
In This Chapter
▶ Walking around inside your model
▶ Creating scenes to capture particular views
▶ Making animations with scenes
▶ Cutting slices through your model with section planes
▶ Generating plans and sections
A
fter you’ve made a model, you’re probably going to want to show it to 
someone. How you present your work depends on the idea you’re trying 
to convey. The tricky part about using SketchUp to present a model isn’t 
actually using the tools; it’s choosing the right tools to get your idea across 
without distracting your audience with a bunch of extra information. Most 3D 
models have so much to look at that the real challenge is to figure out a pre-
sentation method that helps you focus on the stuff you want to talk about.
In this chapter I talk about three different ways to show off your models with-
out ever leaving SketchUp. If you’ve made a building, you can walk around 
inside it. You can even walk up and down stairs and ramps — just like in a 
video game. You can create animated slide shows by setting up scenes with 
different camera views, times of day, and even visual styles. If you want to 
talk about what’s inside your model, you can cut sections through it without 
taking it apart.
As you’re reading this chapter, keep in mind what you want your model to 
communicate. Think about how you might use each method to make a differ-
ent kind of point, and think about the order in which you’d like those points 
to be made. As with everything else in SketchUp (and in life, I suppose), a 
little bit of planning goes a long way. That said, presenting a model live in 
SketchUp is undeniably sexy; you can’t really go wrong, so have fun.

286
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Exploring Your Creation on Foot
Few experiences in life are as satisfying as running around inside your model. 
After you’ve made a space, you can drop down into it and explore by walking 
around, going up and down stairs, bumping into walls, and even falling off 
of ledges. You can check to make sure that the television is visible from the 
kitchen, say, or experience what it would be like to wander down the hall. In 
a potentially confusing building (like an airport or a train station), you could 
figure out where to put the signs by allowing someone who’s never seen your 
model to explore the space “on foot.”
These tools were made for walking
A couple of tools in SketchUp are dedicated to moving around your model as 
if you were actually inside it. The first step (no pun intended) is to position 
yourself so that it seems like you’re standing inside your model. This can be 
tricky with just the Orbit, Pan, and Zoom tools, so SketchUp provides a tool 
just for this: Position Camera. After you’re standing in the right spot (and at 
the right height), you use the Walk tool to move around. It’s as simple as that.
 
The Position Camera and Walk tools get you walking around inside your 
model.
Standing in the right spot: The Position Camera tool
 
The essence of the Position Camera tool is its ability to precisely place your 
viewpoint in SketchUp in a particular spot. That’s really all it does, but it 
works in two different ways. (See this book’s Web site at www.dummies.com/
go/SketchUpFD for more details.)
 
✓ I want to be standing right here. Choose Camera➪Position Camera 
from the menu bar and then click anywhere in the modeling window to 
automatically position your viewpoint 5 feet, 6 inches above wherever 
you clicked. Because this is the average eye-height of an adult human 
being, the result is that you are, for all intents and purposes, standing on 
the spot where you clicked; see Figure 10-1. After using Position Camera, 
SketchUp automatically switches to the Look Around tool, assuming that 
you might want to have a look around. I talk about Look Around in the 
next section of this chapter.
 
 You’re not stuck being five-and-a-half-feet tall forever. After you use 
Position Camera, type in the height you’d rather be and press Enter. 
Type 18”to see a golden retriever’s view of the world, or type 7’ to pre-
tend you play for the L.A. Lakers. Keep in mind that the Measurements 
box (the spot in the lower-right corner where numbers appear) displays 

287
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
your eye height as a distance from the ground, and not from whatever 
surface you’re “standing on.” To set your eye height to be 5 feet above a 
platform that’s 10 feet high, you’d type in 15’.
 
✓ I want my eyes to be right here, and I want to be looking in this direc-
tion. Select Position Camera, click the mouse button while in the spot 
where you want your eyes to be, drag over to the thing you want to 
be looking at (you’ll see a dashed line connecting the two points), and 
release the mouse button (as shown in Figure 10-2). Try this technique a 
couple of times; it takes a bit of practice to master. Use Position Camera 
in this way if you want to stand in a particular spot and look in a particu-
lar direction. This technique works great with scenes, which I talk about 
later in this chapter.

Stepping out with the Walk tool
 
After you’ve used Position Camera to place yourself in your model, use the 
Walk tool to move through it. (Again, find out more on this book’s companion 
Web site.) 
To walk around, click and drag the mouse in the direction you want to move:
 
✓ Straight up is forward.
 
✓ Straight down is backward.
 
✓ Anything to the left or right causes you to turn while you’re walking.

288
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
The farther you move your cursor, the faster you walk. Release the mouse 
button to stop. If you’ve ever played video games, you’ll get used to it 
quickly. If Scrabble is more your speed, it’ll take a few minutes to get the 
hang of things.
 
You can even use the Walk tool to walk up and down stairs and ramps. Keep in 
mind that the highest step you can climb is 22 inches — anything higher and 
you get the “bump” cursor, just like you walked into a wall. Also, if you walk 
off a high surface, you’ll fall to the surface below. It’s times like these that I 
wish SketchUp had cartoon sound effects. . . .
Using modifier keys in combination with the Walk tool makes SketchUp even 
more like a video game:
 
✓ Hold down Ctrl (Option on a Mac) to run instead of walking. This might 
be useful if you’re trying to simulate what it would be like if a werewolf 
were chasing you through your model.
 
✓ Hold down Shift to move straight up (like you’re growing), straight down 
(like you’re shrinking), or sideways (like a crab).
 
✓ Hold down Alt (Ô on a Mac) to disable collision detection, which allows 
you to walk through walls instead of bumping into them. Burglars find 
this handy for entering models without having to break any windows.
Stopping to look around
Look Around is the third tool in SketchUp that’s dedicated to exploring your 
model from the inside. If using Position Camera is like swooping in to stand 
in a particular spot, and Walk is like moving around while maintaining a con-
stant eye-height, Look Around is like turning your head while standing in one 
spot. It’s pretty well named, I think; it does exactly what it says.
 
Using Look Around is so simple it hardly merits these steps:
 
1. Choose Camera➪Look Around.
 
2. Click and drag around in the modeling window to turn your virtual 
head.
 
 Don’t move too fast or you’ll strain your virtual neck, though. Just kidding.
 
While in any of the navigation tools, right-click to access any other navigation 
tool; this makes switching between them a little easier.
When you use Look Around with the field of view tool I discuss in the next 
section, you get a pretty darned realistic simulation of what it would be like 
to be standing in your model.

289
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
Setting your field of view
Field of view is how much of your model you can see in your modeling 
window at one time. Imagine your eyesight kind of like a cone, with the 
pointy end pointing at your eyes and the cone getting bigger as it gets farther 
away from you. Everything that falls inside the cone is visible to you, and 
everything outside the cone isn’t.
If you increase the angle of the cone at the pointy end, the cone gets wider, 
and you see more of what’s in front of you. If you decrease the angle, the 
cone gets narrower, and you see less; see Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
The wider 
your field 
of view, the 
more you 
can see.
 
Measured in degrees, a wide field of view means that you can see more of your 
model without having to move around. The bigger the angle, the more you can 
see. This comes in handy when you’re inside a SketchUp model you’re working 
on, because it’s hard to work on things you can’t see.
 
It’s a good idea to fiddle with your field of view while walking around inside 
your model. Follow these steps to do so:
 
1. Choose Camera➪Field of View.
 
 Notice that the Measurements box in the lower-right corner of your 
modeling window says Field of View and that the default value is 35 deg. 
This means that you currently have a 35-degree cone of vision, which is 
kind of narrow.

290
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
2. Type 60 and press Enter.
 
 Your field of view is increased, and you now have a wider view of your 
model. The trade-off is that you see more distortion at the edges of your 
modeling window as more information is being displayed in the same 
amount of space.
 
A good rule of thumb for setting your field of view is to strike a balance 
between quantity and quality; a wider view always means more distortion. For 
views of the outside of something I’ve built, I like to use a field of view of 35 to 
45 degrees. For interior views, I use 60 or 70 degrees.
 
If you know something about photography, you can express field of view in 
millimeters, just like you’re using a camera lens. Typing in 28mm gives you a 
wide-angle view, just like you’re looking through a 28mm lens. For people who 
think about field of view in these terms, this can be a lot more intuitive than 
trying to imagine cones of vision.
Taking the Scenic Route
Wouldn’t it be great if you could save a particular view of your model? And 
wouldn’t it be even greater if that view could also save things like styles and 
shadow settings? What if you could come back to any of these saved views 
by clicking a button on your screen? What if this whole paragraph were just a 
series of questions?
SketchUp scenes are (you guessed it) saved views of your model. It’s prob-
ably easiest to think of scenes as cameras, except that scenes can save much 
more than just camera positions. 
 
Although they don’t get a lot of space in this book (they don’t even get their 
own chapter), scenes are one of the most important features in SketchUp, for 
three reasons:
 
✓ Scenes can save you hours of time. It’s not always easy to get back to 
exactly the right view by using Orbit, Zoom, and Pan. Sometimes a view 
involves shadows, styles, sections (you read about those later), and 
even hidden geometry. It can be a pain to set up everything the way you 
need it, every time you need it. It’s not that SketchUp’s hard — it’s just 
that you have a lot of different ways to view your model. Making a scene 
reduces the process of changing dozens of settings to a single click of 
your mouse.
 
✓ Scenes are by far the most effective way of presenting your model. 
Saving a scene for each point that you’d like to make in a presentation 
allows you to focus on what you’re trying to say. Instead of fumbling 
around with the navigation tools, turning on shadows, and making 

291
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
the roof visible, you can click a button to transition to the next scene 
(which you’ve already set up exactly the way you want it). Figure 10-4 
shows a set of scenes I created to present a house I designed for my dog, 
Savannah.
 
✓ Scenes are the key to making animations. You make animations by cre-
ating a series of scenes and telling SketchUp to figure out the transitions 
between them. The process, which is explained in later sections, is as 
simple as clicking a button.
 
Figure 10-4: 
I wanted to 
show very 
specific 
views, so 
I created 
scenes.
 
After you get used to them, you’ll find yourself using scenes all the time. Here 
are some of the most common uses for scenes:
 
✓ Showing shade conditions for the same area at different times of the day
 
✓ Saving scenes for each floorplan, building section, and other important 
view of your model
 
✓ Building a walk-through or flyover animation of your design
 
✓ Creating scenes to show several views of the same thing with different 
options (the pointy roof or the flat one, Madam?)
 
✓ Demonstrating change over time by showing or hiding a succession of 
components
Creating scenes
Let’s get one thing straight: Making a scene in SketchUp is not like taking a 
snapshot of your model. If you create a scene to save a view, then do some 
more modeling, and then return to that scene, your model will not go back to 
the way it was when you created the scene. The camera position will be the 
same and the settings will be the same, but your geometry won’t be. This is a 
pretty important concept, and one that makes using scenes so powerful.

292
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
A scene is just a set of view settings, which means that they’re automatically 
updated to reflect your changes every time you edit your model. You can 
make some scenes and use them all the way through your process, from when 
you start modeling to when you present your design to the president. Or to 
your mother.
 
Creating scenes is a simple process. The basic idea is that you add a scene to 
your SketchUp file whenever you have a view you want to return to later. You 
can always delete scenes, so there’s no downside to using lots of them. Follow 
these steps to make a new scene (and check this book’s companion Web site 
for additional help):
When scenes and styles collide
Sooner or later, you’ll be presented with the 
Warning — Scenes and Styles dialog box 
shown here. It pops up whenever you try to 
create a scene without first saving the changes 
you’ve made to the style applied to your model. 
In other words, SketchUp tries to help out by 
reminding you to keep styles in mind while 
you’re working with scenes. (The first part of 
Chapter 9 is all about styles, just in case you 
need a refresher.)
This warning dialog box gives you three 
options; here’s some guidance on which one 
to choose:
 ✓ Save as a New Style: Adds a new style 
to your In Model styles library. When you 
come back to this scene, it looks exactly the 
way it did when you created it. Choosing 
this option is the safest way to proceed 
because it can’t affect any other scene.
 ✓ Update the Selected Style: Choose this 
option only if you know what effect this will 
have on the other scenes in your model — 
if the style you’re updating is applied to any 
of them, you’ll affect the way they look. In 
models with lots of scenes and styles, this 
can have big implications.
 ✓ Do Nothing to Save Changes: Creates 
a scene with your current style applied, 
completely ignoring any changes you may 
have made to that style. When you come 
back to this scene, it looks different than it 
did when you created it. Only choose this 
option if you really know what you’re doing, 
or if you enjoy doing the same thing more 
than once.

293
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
 
1. Choose Window➪Scenes to open the Scenes dialog box.
 
 When it first opens, it doesn’t look like there’s much to the Scenes dialog 
box. Expanding it by clicking the expansion toggle in the upper-right 
corner reveals more options, which I cover in the next section, but don’t 
worry about that right now.
 
2. Set up your view however you want.
 
 Navigate around until you’re happy with your point of view. If you want, 
use the Shadows and Styles dialog boxes to change the way your model 
looks.
 
3. Click the Add button to make a new scene with your current view 
settings.
 
 At this point, a new scene is added to your SketchUp file. If this is the 
first scene you’ve created, it will be called Scene 1 and will appear in two 
places (see Figure 10-5):
 
• As a list item in the Scenes dialog box, right underneath the Add 
button
 
• As a tab at the top of your modeling window, labeled Scene 1

added

Nothing is generated outside of SketchUp when you add a scene; it’s not like 
exporting a JPEG or a TIFF. Scenes are just little bits of programming code that 
“remember” the view settings in effect when they were created. Scenes also 
don’t add much to your file size, so you don’t have to worry about using too 
many of them.
Moving from scene to scene
Activate a scene you’ve added earlier by doing one of three things:
 
✓ Double-clicking the name of the scene in the Scenes dialog box.
 
✓ Clicking the tab for that scene at the top of the modeling window.
 
✓ Right-clicking any scene tab and choosing Play Animation to make 
SketchUp automatically flip through your scenes. (Choose Play 
Animation again to make the animation stop.)
Notice how the transition from one scene to the next is animated? You don’t 
have to do anything special to make this happen; it’s something SketchUp 
automatically does to make things look better (and ultimately, to make you 
look better).
You can adjust the way SketchUp transitions between scenes, which is 
handy for customizing your presentations. Follow these steps to access 
these settings:
 
1. Choose Window➪Model Info.
 
2. On the left side of the Model Info dialog box, choose Animation.
 
 The Animation settings panel in the Model Info dialog box (see Figure 
10-6) isn’t very complicated, but it can make a huge difference in the 
appearance of your scene-related presentations.

big help in 
customizing 
your pre-
sentations.

 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
 
3. In the Scene Transitions area, set how SketchUp transitions from one 
scene to another.
 
 These settings apply to both manual (clicking a page tab) and automatic 
(playing an animation) scene transitions:
 
• Enable Scene Transitions: Deselect this check box to make 
SketchUp change scenes without animating the transitions 
between them. You’ll probably want to do this if your model is so 
complex (or your computer is so slow) that animated transitions 
don’t look good.
 
• Seconds: If you’ve selected the Enable Scene Transitions check 
box, the number of seconds you enter here will be the amount of 
time it takes SketchUp to transition from one scene to the next. If 
you’re “moving the camera” very far between scenes, it’s a good 
idea to bump up the transition time so that your audience doesn’t 
get sick. I find three seconds to be a good compromise between 
nausea and boredom.
 
 If you’re presenting an incomplete model (perhaps you’ve thought about 
the garage and the living room, but nothing in between), it can be help-
ful to turn off scene transitions. That way, your audience won’t see the 
things you haven’t worked on when you click a tab to change scenes. It’s 
sneaky, but effective.
 
4. In the Scene Delay area, set the length of time SketchUp pauses on 
each slide before it moves to the next one.
 
 If you want it to seem like you’re walking or flying, set this to 0. If you 
want time to talk about each scene in your presentation, bump this up a 
few seconds.
Making walk-throughs
A really great way to use scenes is to pretend 
you’re walking or flying through your model. By 
setting up your scenes sequentially, you can 
give a seamless tour without having to mess 
around with the navigation tools. This is espe-
cially handy when you need to be able to “walk 
and talk” at the same time.
Here are some tips that can help you to simulate 
a person walking or flying through your model 
with scenes:
 ✓ Adjust your field of view. For interior anima-
tions, make your camera “see” a wider area 
by setting your field of view to 60 degrees. I 
like to set my field of view between 30 and 
45 degrees for exterior views, but there’s 
no hard and fast rule. I talk about how to 
do this in the section “Setting your field of 
view,” earlier in this chapter.
 ✓ Make sure that your scenes aren’t too far 
apart. Instead of racing through a room 
like it’s on fire, don’t be afraid to add more 
(continued)

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Modifying scenes after you’ve made ’em
After you create a whole bunch of scenes, it’s inevitable that you’re going 
to need to fiddle with them in some way. After all, modifying something is 
almost always easier than making it all over again, and the same thing holds 
(continued)
scenes. Your audience will thank you by not 
throwing up on your conference table.
 ✓ Add scenes at equal distance intervals. 
Because SketchUp only lets you control the 
scene transition timing for all your scenes 
at once, it’s best to make sure that your 
scenes are set up about the same distance 
apart. If you don’t, your walk-through ani-
mations will be jerky and strange, like my 
dancing.
 ✓ Don’t forget the animation settings in the 
Model Info dialog box. Set the scene delay 
to 0 seconds so that your animation doesn’t 
pause at every scene. For a normal walk-
ing speed, set your scene transitions so 
that you’re moving about 5 feet per second. 
If your scenes are about 20 feet apart, set 
your scene transition time to 4 seconds. 
This gives your audience time to look 
around and notice things. For flying anima-
tions, pick a scene transition time that looks 
good.
 ✓ Slide around corners. When you’re setting 
up a walking animation, you have an easy, 
reliable way to turn corners without seem-
ing too robotic. The method is illustrated in 
the following figure. Basically, the trick is to 
add a scene just short of where you want to 
turn — in this case, a few feet ahead of the 
doorway. The key is to angle your view into 
the turn slightly. You should set up your next 
scene just past the turn, close to the inside 
and facing the new view. This technique 
makes it seem like you’re turning corners 
naturally.

297
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
true for scenes. Because your SketchUp model will change a million times, 
understanding how to make changes to your existing scenes can save you a 
lot of time in the long run.
 
Certain aspects of the scene-modification process can get a little tricky. This is 
kind of surprising, given how simple the rest of working with scenes can be, 
but I think it’s inevitable. You deal with a lot of complexity when working in 
SketchUp, and this is just one of the places where that complexity rears its 
ugly head. The upshot: Pay special attention to the section on updating 
scenes, and don’t worry if it takes a little while to figure things out. It happens 
to the best of us.
Reordering, renaming, and removing scenes
Making simple modifications to scenes, such as reordering, renaming, and 
removing them, is easy. You can accomplish each of these in two ways: You 
either use the Scenes dialog box, or you right-click the scene tabs at the top 
of your modeling window. Figure 10-7 is an illustration.
 
Figure 10-7: 
You can 
modify 
scenes 
by right-
clicking 
scene tabs 
or by using 
the Scenes 
dialog box.
 
 
To access the modification controls in the Scenes dialog box, click the arrow-
shaped expansion button in the upper-right corner.

298
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Here’s how to reorder, rename, or remove scenes:
 
✓ Reordering scenes: You can change the order in which scenes play in 
a slide show. If you’re using scenes, you’ll need to do this often — trust 
me. Use one of the following methods:
 
• Right-click the tab of the scene you want to move (in the modeling 
window) and choose Move Right or Move Left.
 
• In the expanded Scenes dialog box, click the name of the scene you 
want to move to select it, and then click the up or down arrows 
to the right of the list to change the scene’s position in the scene 
order.
 
✓ Renaming scenes: It’s a good idea to give your scenes meaningful 
names: “Living Room,” “Top View,” and “Shadows at 5:00 p.m.” are 
descriptive enough to be useful. “Scene 14,” I find, lacks a certain je ne 
sais quoi. Use one of the following methods:
 
• Right-click the scene tab and choose Rename.
 
• In the Scenes dialog box, select the scene you want to rename and 
type something into the Name field below the list. If you’re feeling 
really organized, go ahead and give it a description, too — more 
information never hurts.
 
✓ Removing scenes: If you don’t need a scene anymore, feel free to delete 
it. However, if you have a scene that you don’t want to appear in slide 
shows, you don’t have to get rid of it. Use one of the following methods 
to remove a scene:
 
• Right-click the scene tab and choose Delete to get rid of it 
permanently.
 
• In the Scenes dialog box, select the scene you want to ax and click 
the Delete button.
 
 To exclude a scene from slide shows without getting rid of it, select its 
name in the list and deselect the Include in Animation check box.
Working with scene properties
Okay. Turn off the television. Send the kids outside to play. Do whatever you 
need to do to concentrate, because wrapping your head around the concept of 
scene properties isn’t altogether straightforward. I do my best to explain it.
Basically, a scene is just a collection of saved viewing properties. Each of 
these properties has something to do with how your model looks:
 
✓ Camera location: Camera location properties include the camera posi-
tion, or viewpoint, and the field of view. I discuss field of view earlier in 
this chapter.

299
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
 
✓ Hidden geometry: Hidden geometry properties are really just one thing: 
what elements are hidden and what elements aren’t. These properties 
keep track of the visibility of the lines, faces, groups, and components in 
your model.
 
✓ Visible layers: Visible layer properties keep track of the visibility of 
layers in your model.
 
✓ Active section planes: Active section plane properties include the vis-
ibility of section planes and whether they’re active. I talk about sections 
in the last part of this chapter.
 
✓ Style and fog: Style and fog properties are all the settings in the Styles 
and Fog dialog boxes, and there are a lot of them.
 
✓ Shadow settings: Shadow settings properties include whether shadows 
are turned on and the time and date for which the shadows are set. They 
also include all the other settings in the Shadow Settings dialog box.
 
✓ Axes locations: Axes location properties are very specific. They keep 
track of the visibility of the main red, green, and blue axes in your mod-
eling window. Because you’ll often want to hide the axes when giving a 
presentation, these elements get their own properties.
 
Here’s the tricky part: You can have your scenes save (remember) any combi-
nation of the preceding properties — it’s not an all-or-nothing proposition. 
Once the full impact of this information soaks in, you’ll realize that this means 
that scenes are much more powerful than they first appear.
 
By creating scenes that only save one or two properties (instead of all 
seven), you can use scenes to do some pretty nifty things. Here are three of 
my favorites:
 
✓ Create scenes that only affect your camera location, allowing you to 
return to any point of view without affecting anything else about the way 
your model looks (such as styles and hidden geometry).
 
✓ Create scenes that only affect styles and shadows, letting you quickly 
change between simple and complex (hard on your computer) display 
settings without affecting your camera location.
 
✓ Create scenes that have different combinations of hidden geometry to 
look at design alternatives without changing your model’s style and 
camera location.
The key to working with scene properties is the expanded Scenes dialog box, 
visible in Figure 10-8. It’s really pretty simple, but folks who understand it are 
few and far between. Prepare to join the informed minority.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
Figure 10-8: 
Choose 
which

to save 
in the

dialog box. 
 
Follow these steps to set which properties a scene should save:
 
1. In the Scenes dialog box, select the scene whose properties you want 
to fiddle with.
 
 You don’t have to be viewing this scene when you edit it; you can edit 
properties for any scene at any time.
 
2. If not already expanded, click the arrow button in the upper-right 
corner of the Scenes dialog box.
 
3. Check the boxes next to the properties you want to save.
 
 That’s it. You don’t have to click Save anywhere to make your changes 
stick. A little anticlimactic, no?
Updating scenes
If you want to update (make changes to) an existing scene, you have a couple 
of options: 
 
✓ Update all of the scene’s properties at once, which is a piece of cake. 
 
✓ Update the scene’s properties selectively, which is not quite as simple. 
Read on for both sets of instructions.
Updating all the scene properties at once
The simplest way to modify a scene is to not worry about individual properties. 
 
After you update a scene, you can’t use Undo to revert things back to the way 
they were. Save your SketchUp file right before updating a scene and choosing 
File➪Revert if you don’t like how things turn out.

301
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
If all you want to do is update a scene after you’ve made an adjustment to the 
appearance of your model, you’re in luck. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the tab of the scene you want to update.
 
 The tabs are at the top of the modeling window.
 
2. Make whatever styles, shadows, camera, or other display changes you 
want to your model.
 
3. Right-click the current scene tab and choose Update.
 
 
 Be careful not to accidentally double-click the tab or you’ll reactivate the 
scene and lose all the changes you made. The old scene properties are 
replaced by the new ones, and you’re home free.
Updating scene properties selectively
Here’s where things get complicated. At times in your SketchUp life, you’ll 
want to update a scene without updating all its properties.
 
Updating scenes selectively involves making changes that you won’t be able to 
see immediately; whenever you do this, you have the potential for disaster to 
strike. Copy your SketchUp file before updating more than one scene at a time, 
just in case something awful happens.
Maybe you’ve used scenes to create a tour of the sunroom you’re designing 
for a client, and you want to change the shadow settings to make your model 
look brighter. You have 30 scenes in your presentation, and your meeting’s 
in 5 minutes. You don’t have time to change and update all 30 scenes one at a 
time. What to do? Follow these steps (and have a look at Figure 10-9):
 
1. Adjust the shadow settings to where you’d like them to be for all the 
scenes you’d like to update.
 
 While this example deals with shadows, this same method applies to any 
scene properties changes you’d like to make.
 
2. In the Scenes dialog box, select all the scenes you’d like to update.
 
 Hold down Shift to select more than one scene at a time.
 
3. Click the Update button in the Scenes dialog box.
 
 A Properties to Update dialog box appears.
 
4. Select the Shadow Settings check box and click the Update button.
 
 If all you want to update are the shadow settings, make sure that only 
that check box is selected. More generally, you would select the check 
box next to each of the properties you want to update. All the selected 
scenes are updated with those new properties, and all the properties left 
deselected remain unchanged.

Mastering the Sectional Approach
Software like SketchUp has a funny way of providing moments of perfect sim-
plicity, moments when you sit back, scratch your head, and think to yourself, 
“That’s it? That’s all there is to it?”
Sections in SketchUp offer one of those moments. To put it simply, sections 
are objects that let you cut away parts of your model to look inside. You 
place them wherever you need them, use them to create views you wouldn’t 
otherwise be able to get, and then delete them when you’re done. When you 
move a section plane, you get instant feedback; the “cut” view of your model 
moves, too. If you want to get fancy, you can embed them in scenes and even 
use them in animations. Sections are the icing on the SketchUp cake: easy to 
use, incredibly important, and impressive as all get out.
People use sections for all kinds of things:
 
✓ Creating standard orthographic views (like plans and sections) of build-
ings and other objects
 
✓ Making cutaway views of complex models to make them easier to 
understand
 
✓ Working on the interiors of buildings without having to move or hide 
geometry
 
✓ Generating sectional animations with scenes

303
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
Cutting plans and sections
The most common use for sections is to create straight-on, cut-through views 
of your model. Some of the views often include dimensions and are typical of 
the kinds of drawings that architects make to design and explain space. 
They’re useful because 
 
✓ They’re easy to read. 
 
✓ You can take measurements from them (if they’re printed to scale). 
 
✓ They provide information that no other drawing type can. 
 
The following terms (which are illustrated in Figure 10-10) can help you create 
different views of your model more easily:
 
✓ Plan: A planimetric view, or plan, is a top-down, two-dimensional, non-
perspectival view of an object or space. Put simply, it’s every drawing 
of a house floorplan you’ve ever seen. You generate a plan by cutting 
an imaginary horizontal slice through your model. Everything below the 
slice is visible, and everything above it isn’t.
 
✓ Section: Not to be confused with sections (the SketchUp feature about 
which this section of the book is written), a sectional view, or section, is 
a from-the-side, two-dimensional, nonperspectival view of an object or 
space. You would make a section by cutting an imaginary vertical slice 
through your model. Just like in a plan view, everything on one side of 
the slice is visible, and everything on the other side is hidden.
 
Figure 10-10: 
A plan is a 
horizontal 
cut, while a 
section is a 
vertical one.
 
You cut plans and sections by adding section planes to your model. These 
are a little abstract, because nothing like them exists in real life. In SketchUp, 
section planes are objects that affect the visibility of certain parts of your 
model. When a section plane is active, everything in front of it is visible and 
everything behind is hidden. Everywhere your model is cut by a section 
plane, a slightly thicker section cut line appears.

304
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
If you’re using Windows, open the Sections toolbar by choosing View➪
Toolbars➪Sections. If you’re on a Mac, the Section Plane tool is in the Large 
Tool Set, which you can activate by choosing View➪Tool Palettes➪Large Tool 
Set. On both platforms, Section Plane looks like a white circle with letters and 
numbers in it.
 
To add a section plane, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Section Plane to activate the Section Plane tool.
 
 You can also activate Section Plane by choosing its icon from the Large 
Tool Set (Mac) or the Sections toolbar (Windows), if you have it open.
 
2. Move the Section Plane tool around your model.
 
 Notice how the orientation of the Section Plane cursor (which is quite 
large) changes to be coplanar to whatever surface you’re hovering over. 
Check out Figure 10-11 to see this in action.
 
3. When you’ve figured out where you want it, click once to add a sec-
tion plane.
 
 To create a plan view, add a horizontal section plane by clicking a hori-
zontal plane like a floor. For a sectional view, add a vertical section 
plane by clicking a wall or other vertical surface. You can, of course, add 
Cutting like an architect
In architecture, the convention is to cut plans at 
a height of 48 inches, meaning that the imagi-
nary horizontal slice is made 4 feet above the 
floor surface. This ensures that doors and most 
windows are shown cut through by the slice, 
while counters, tables, and other furniture are 
below it, and thus are fully visible. You can see 
what I mean in Figure 10-10. These things are 
important when you’re trying to explain a space 
to someone. After all, architectural drawings 
are two-dimensional abstractions of three-
dimensional space, and every little bit of clarity 
helps.
When it comes to architectural sections (as 
opposed to sections, the SketchUp feature), 
there’s no convention for where to cut them, but 
you should follow a couple of rules:
 ✓ Never cut through columns. If you show a 
column in section, it looks like a wall. This 
is bad, because sections are supposed to 
show the degree to which a space is open 
or closed. You can walk around a column, 
but you can’t walk through a wall (at least I 
can’t).
 ✓ Try your best to cut through stairs, ele-
vators, and other vertical circulation. 
Showing how people move up and down 
through your building makes your drawings 
a lot more readable, not to mention interest-
ing. Figure 10-10 shows what I’m getting at.

305
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
section planes wherever you want; they don’t have to be aligned to hori-
zontal or vertical planes. Figure 10-12 shows a section plane added to a 
model of a house.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
4. Choose the Move tool.
 
5. Move the section plane you just added by clicking it once to pick it up 
and again to drop it.
 
 You can only slide your section plane back and forth in two directions; 
SketchUp only allows section planes to move perpendicular to their cut-
ting planes. When you’re deciding where to locate your cut, the nearby 
sidebar, “Cutting like an architect,” offers helpful pointers.
 
 After you’ve added a section plane and moved it to the desired location, 
you can rotate and even copy it, just like any other object in your model. 
It will never affect your geometry — just the way you view it.
 
6. If you need to rotate your section plane, select it and use the Rotate 
tool.
 
 Why rotate a section plane? In certain circumstances, rotating a sec-
tion plane (instead of creating a brand-new one) can help to explain a 
complex interior space. Showing a plan view becoming a sectional one 
is a powerful way to explain architectural drawings to an audience that 
doesn’t understand them.
 
 Read more about the Rotate tool in Chapter 6.
 
7. To make a new section plane by copying an existing one, use the 
Move or Rotate tool to do it the same way you would make a copy of 
any other SketchUp object.
 
 Chapter 2 explains these basic actions in detail.
 
 Copying section planes is a great way to space them a known distance 
apart; this can be trickier if you use the Section Plane tool to keep 
adding new ones, instead.
 
 Figure 10-13 shows moving, rotating, and copying a section plane.
 
Figure 10-13: 
Moving, 
rotating, 
and copying 
a section

When the section plane you’ve added is in position, you’re ready to control 
how it impacts visibility in a number of other ways. See the following sections 
for details.

307
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
Controlling individual section planes
You can control the way section planes behave by right-clicking them to 
bring up a context menu that looks like the one shown in Figure 10-14. I show 
examples of what the following options do in the same illustration:
 
Figure 10-14: 
Right-
clicking 
a section 
plane gives 
you some 
options.
 
 
✓ Reverse: This option flips the direction of the section plane, hiding 
everything that was previously visible, and revealing everything that 
used to be behind the cut. Use this when you need to see inside the rest 
of your model.
 
✓ Active Cut: Although you can have multiple section planes in your 
model, only one of them can be active at a time. The active cut is the sec-
tion plane that is actually cutting through your model; others are consid-
ered inactive. If you have more than one section plane, use Active Cut to 
tell SketchUp which one should be active.
 
 You can have more than one active section plane in your model at a 
time, but doing so requires that you nest, or embed, each section plane 
in a separate group or component. It’s possible to achieve some pretty 
spiffy effects with this technique, but I’m afraid I don’t have room to 
include more than this mention of it in this book. You can read all about 
groups and components in Chapter 5.

308
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
✓ Align View: When you choose Align View, your view changes so that 
you’re looking straight on at the section plane. You can use this option 
to produce views like the ones that I describe in the section “Getting dif-
ferent sectional views,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Create Group from Slice: This option doesn’t have much to do with the 
other choices in this context menu; it’s really a modeling tool. You can 
use this to do exactly what it says: create a group from the active slice, 
or section plane. I don’t use this very often, but it comes in handy for 
creating filled-in section cuts for final presentations.
Setting section-plane visibility
 
If you want to control the visibility of all your section planes at once, a couple 
of menu options can help. You use both of these toggles in combination to 
control how section cuts appear in your model. These two options, shown on 
the View menu, are illustrated in Figure 10-15:
 
Figure 10-15: 
Control sec-
tion plane 
visibility 
with Section 
Planes and 
Section Cut.
 
 
✓ Section Planes: This choice toggles the visibility of section-plane objects 
without affecting the section cuts they produce. More simply, deselect-
ing Section Planes hides all the section planes in your model, but doesn’t 
turn off the section cut effect, as shown in the middle image in Figure 
10-14. This is how you’ll probably want to show most of your sectional 
views, so this is a pretty important toggle.
 
✓ Section Cut: Deselecting this option toggles the section cut effect on and 
off without affecting the visibility of the section-plane objects in your 
model. This choice is sort of the opposite of Section Planes, in the previ-
ous point, but it’s every bit as important.
Getting different sectional views
Using section planes, you can get a couple of useful and impressive views of 
your model without much trouble. The second builds on the first, and both 
are shown in Figure 10-16. A section perspective (left) is a special kind of way 
to view a three-dimensional space. The second type, an orthographic view 
(right), is straight on and doesn’t use perspective.

Making a section perspective
If you imagine cutting a building in half and then looking at the cut surface 
straight on while looking inside, you have a section perspective. The section 
part of the term refers to the fact that the building has been cut away. The 
perspective part indicates that objects seen inside the space appear to get 
smaller as they get farther away.
 
Section perspectives are a great (not to mention incredibly cool) way of show-
ing interior space in a way that’s understandable to most people. To create a 
section perspective using the Section Plane tool in SketchUp, follow these 
steps (and check out this book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com/
go/SketchUpFD for additional help):
 
1. Select the section plane you’d like to use to make a section perspec-
tive by clicking it with the Select tool.
 
 When it’s selected, your section plane turns blue, assuming that you 
haven’t changed any of the default colors in the Styles dialog box.
 
2. If the selected section plane isn’t active, right-click and choose 
Active Cut.
 
 Active section planes cut through their surrounding geometry. If your 
section plane is visible but isn’t cutting through anything, it isn’t active.
 
3. Right-click the selected section plane and choose Align View.
 
 This aligns your view so that it’s straight on (perpendicular) to your sec-
tion plane.
 
4. If you can’t see your model properly, choose Camera➪Zoom Extents.
 
 This zooms your view so that you can see your whole model in the 
modeling window.

Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
Generating an orthographic section
Ever seen a technical drawing that included top, front, rear, and side views 
of the same object? Chances are that was an orthographic projection, which 
is a common way for three-dimensional objects to be drawn so that they 
can be built.
Producing an orthographic section of your model is pretty easy; it’s only one 
extra step beyond making a section perspective. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Follow Steps 1–3 in the preceding section, as if you’re making a sec-
tion perspective.
 
2. Choose Camera➪Parallel Projection.
 
 This switches off Perspective, turning your view into a true orthographic 
representation of your model. If you printed it at a specific scale, you 
could take measurements from the printout.
 
To print a plan or section view of your model at a particular scale, have a look 
at Chapter 12, where I explain the whole process.
Creating section animations with scenes
This is probably one of the most useful and impressive things you can do 
with this software, but some people who have been using SketchUp for years 
don’t know about it. The basic idea is that you can use scenes to create ani-
mations where your section planes move inside your model. Here are a few 
reasons you might want to use this technique:
 
✓ If you have a building with several levels, you can create an animated 
presentation that shows a cutaway plan view of each level.
 
✓ Using an animated section plane to “get inside” your model is a much 
classier transition than simply hiding certain parts of it.
 
✓ When you need to show the relationship between the plan and section 
views for a project, using an animated section plane helps to explain the 
concept of different architectural views to 3D beginners.
 
Follow these steps to create a basic section animation. A simple example is 
illustrated in Figure 10-17 (and check out this book’s companion Web site for 
additional help):
 
1. Add a section plane to your model.
 
 I give a complete explanation of how to create section planes in the sec-
tion “Cutting plans and sections,” earlier in this chapter.

311
 Chapter 10: Presenting Your Model Inside SketchUp
 
Figure 10-17:

animation 
is a fairly 
straight-
forward 
process.
 
 
2. Add a scene to your model.
 
 Check out the section “Creating scenes,” earlier in this chapter, for a 
complete rundown on adding scenes.
 
3. Add another section plane to your model.
 
 You can add another section plane in one of two ways:
 
• Use the Section Plane tool to create a brand-new one. This is 
probably the easiest option, and it’s the one I recommend if you’re 
just starting out.
 
• Use the Move tool to copy an existing section plane. I talk about 
copying section planes in the section “Cutting plans and sections,” 
earlier in this chapter.
 
 Make sure that your new section plane is active; if it is, it’ll be cutting 
through your model. If it isn’t, right-click the section plane and choose 
Active Cut from the context menu.
 
4. Add another scene to your model.
 
 This new scene remembers which is the active section plane.
 
5. Click through the scenes you added to view your animation.
 
 You should see an animated section cut as SketchUp transitions from 
one scene to the next. If you don’t, make sure that you have scene transi-
tions enabled. You can verify this by choosing Window➪Model Info and 
then choosing the Animations panel in the Model Info dialog box. The 
Scene Transitions check box should be selected.
 
If you don’t like being able to see the section-plane objects (the boxy things 
with arrows on their corners) in your animation, switch them off by deselect-
ing Section Planes on the View menu. You should still be able to see your sec-
tion cuts, but you won’t see any ugly gray rectangles flying around.

312
Part III: Viewing Your Model in Different Ways 
 
The hardest thing to remember about using scenes and section planes to 
make section animations is this: You need a separate section plane for each 
scene that you create. That is to say, SketchUp animates the transition from 
one active section plane to another active section plane. If all you do is move 
the same section plane to another spot and add a scene, this technique won’t 
work. Believe it or not, it took me two years to figure this out, so don’t feel 
dense if you need to come back and read this section a couple of times. 

Part IV
Sharing What 
You’ve Made

In this part . . .
I 
suppose for some people in the world, 3D modeling is 
an intensely private endeavor; they build something in 
SketchUp, burn the SKP file to a disc, and then hide the 
disc in the crawlspace under the house.
If you’re not one of these people, you’re probably looking 
forward to doing something with the models you make — 
printing them, making animations, and sending them to 
other software programs. After all, for most folks, 
SketchUp is just the beginning of a process that includes 
lots of other steps.
The chapters in this part describe all the different things 
you can do with your models after you build them. 
Chapter 11 talks about using SketchUp with Google Earth. 
Chapter 12 is about printing, and Chapter 13 describes the 
process of exporting images and animations. Chapter 14 is 
a quick overview of LayOut, the brand-new presentation 
document design tool that comes with SketchUp 7 Pro.

f you’ve ever used Google Earth, you know what it’s like to look up from 
your computer and realize you just have no idea what time it is. There is 
no better way to spend several hours than to travel to Paris, Cairo, and the 
South Pole while checking out the peak of Mount Everest and looking at your 
old elementary school along the way. I love Google Earth because it does 
what Star Trek said computers are supposed to let us do — forget we’re using 
technology and explore information in a way we never could before.
What if you could see 3D models of buildings and other man-made structures 
in Google Earth the same way that you can see aerial images and 3D topogra-
phy? You can. What if you could build your own models, in SketchUp, and see 
them in Google Earth? You can do that, too. What if you could allow everyone 
who uses Google Earth — there are hundreds of millions of them — to see 
your models in their copies of Google Earth, no matter where they are? Now 
you’re getting the idea. . . .

316
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
In this chapter, I talk about making SketchUp models that you and (if you 
want) anyone else can see on Google Earth. I also talk about the Google 3D 
Warehouse: a great big, online repository of free 3D models that anyone 
(including you) can contribute to or borrow from. It’s a big, friendly 3D world 
out there, and this chapter is your Getting Started guide.
Getting the Big (3D) Picture
Okay. So there’s SketchUp, which (I have to assume) you’re pretty familiar 
with by now. Then there’s Google Earth, which you’ve probably seen and 
which you probably think is pretty neat. Finally, there’s the 3D Warehouse, 
which you might not know anything about — don’t worry about that. Here’s 
the “lay of the land” when it comes to the relationship among these three 
things and what they’re supposed to do:
 
✓ Google SketchUp: Because SketchUp is especially good for architec-
ture, you can use it to make buildings that you can look at in Google 
Earth. If you want, you can also upload (send) what you make to the 3D 
Warehouse, where anyone who finds it can download (borrow) your 
model and use it in his or her own copy of SketchUp.
 
✓ Google Earth (http://earth.google.com): Earth is a software pro-
gram that lets you explore the world by “flying” around, zooming in on 
things that interest you. The more you zoom, the better the detail gets; 
in some places, you can see things as small as coffee cups. The imagery 
in Google Earth is anywhere from a couple of weeks to four years old, 
but it gets updated all the time. If you want, you can build models in 
SketchUp and view them in Google Earth. You can also see models that 
other people have made. Eventually, Google Earth will include entire 3D 
cities, built in SketchUp by people all over the world.
 
✓ Google 3D Warehouse (http://sketchup.google.
com/3dwarehouse): The 3D Warehouse is a huge collection of 3D 
models that lives on Google’s servers. The models all come from people 
just like you and me; anyone can contribute models, and anyone can use 
them in their own SketchUp projects. Some of the best models in the 3D 
Warehouse are used in a special layer where anyone can see them while 
they’re flying around in Google Earth.
If you’re the kind of person who likes diagrams (I know I am), Figure 11-1 
might help; it shows the SketchUp/Earth/3D Warehouse workflow in a non-
paragraphish way.

Taking the Ten-Minute Tour 
of Google Earth
Google Earth is a pretty deep piece of software, not because it’s hard to use 
(it’s not) but because you can use it to do an awful lot. I’m not even going to 
try to explain it in this section; this is the “zooming past it in a speeding car” 
tour that should be enough to get you started.

318
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Getting Google Earth
Here’s a piece of good news for you: Just like Google SketchUp, the basic ver-
sion of Google Earth is free. Why? My mother always told me not to look a 
gift horse in the mouth, and Google Earth is the Secretariat of gift horses. All 
that matters to me is that people with a computer that can run SketchUp can 
also run Google Earth, and they don’t have to pay for it. Here are some more 
things you need to know:
 
✓ You get Google Earth by downloading it. Just go to http://earth.
google.com, click the Downloads link on the left, select your operat-
ing system, and then click the big Download button. While you’re there, 
check out some of the other features of the site. You should be able to 
find answers to any other questions you have, as well as links to online 
help, user communities, and more. You can even find out about what 
you get in the fancier versions of Google Earth, if that’s what floats 
your boat.
 
✓ You need a fast Internet connection. The magic of Google Earth is its 
ability to show you detailed imagery of the whole world — that’s lots 
and lots of data that Google keeps on its servers until you request it by 
flying somewhere and zooming in. The faster your Internet connection, 
the faster you can stream imagery, 3D buildings, and topography into 
your copy of Google Earth. As you can imagine, Google Earth isn’t worth 
a darn if you’re not online.
 
✓ You should clear your schedule. If this is the first time you’ve used 
Google Earth, don’t plan to do much of anything else for the next few 
hours. It’s that much fun — and that addictive. If any geography nuts 
reside in your household, you might need to buy another computer.
Getting your first dose
Google Earth can do a bunch of stuff, but the following sections describe the 
first three things you should do with the software; have a look at Figure 11-2 
for a view of the Google Earth user interface.
Flying around
Check out the upper-right corner of the screen; you’ll find the navigation 
controls for Google Earth conveniently grouped together. Notice how they 
appear when you hover over them? Go ahead and play around to figure out 
what they do. Here’s some help:

319
 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
 
✓ Zoom: Move this slider back and forth to zoom in and out on whatever’s 
in the center of your screen. As you approach the ground, you’ll auto-
matically “pull up” to end up “standing” on your virtual feet. You can 
also use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom, just like you do in 
SketchUp.
 
✓ Pan/Move: You can move around by clicking and holding down the 
arrow buttons to go forward, backwards, left and right, but the easier 
way is to use your mouse. Just click and drag to “spin” the world in 
whatever direction you want.
 
✓ Rotate/Tilt: Drag the wheel to spin yourself around without moving. 
Click the N button to reorient the world so that north is up. Click and 
drag on the arrows in the center to turn and tilt your view (a lot like the 
Look Around tool in SketchUp).
 
 If you’re looking at an area with mountains, they should look like a 3D 
image (if they don’t, make sure that the Terrain layer is enabled in the 
lower-left corner). You can also tilt by holding down your scroll wheel 
button, the same way you do to orbit in SketchUp. (See Chapter 2 for 
more on orbiting.)

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Going someplace specific
See the blank field in the upper-left corner that says “Fly To”? Go ahead and 
type in an address anywhere in the world, and Google Earth will fly you 
directly there. It works better for some places than others, but nobody’s 
perfect. Here are some tips:
 
✓ Use the right format. If you’re entering an address in the United States 
or Canada, use this format: Street Number Street Name, Zip (Postal) 
Code. Here’s an example: 1234 Cherry Blvd, 64254. If it doesn’t work the 
first time, try a few variations.
 
✓ Type in landmarks. Try typing Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty. I have 
no idea how Google does this, but it just seems to work.
 
✓ Get directions. Click the Directions tab (also in the upper-left corner of 
the screen), and then enter Origin and Destination addresses to see a 
list of driving directions along with a colored path on the ground.
Making some placemarks
You can stick “pins” into Google Earth to mark locations you’d like to come 
back to later; they’re called placemarks. Follow these steps to create one 
yourself:
 
1. Fly to where you want to create a placemark.
 
2. Click the Create Placemark button at the top of the screen.
 
3. Move your placemark (it looks like a thumbtack) to exactly where you 
want it (on top of your house, for instance).
 
4. Give your placemark a name in the Edit Placemark dialog box.
 
5. Click the OK button.
Your new placemark should show up in the Places section on the left of your 
screen. No matter where you are in the world, double-clicking the name of 
your placemark in the Places list will fly you right there.
Building Models for Google Earth
Google Earth is fun and all, but you’re interested in SketchUp, right? What 
you want to do is build a model of a building (maybe your house) and see 
it in Google Earth. After you’ve done that, you can e-mail the model to your 
friends (or clients) so that they can see it in Google Earth, too. And if you’re 
especially proud of what you make, you can upload it to the 3D Warehouse 
so that the whole world can see it.

321
 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
First things first. In this section, I talk about the basic procedure for making a 
model in SketchUp and viewing it in Google Earth. I also provide some tips for 
making buildings that are optimized for Earth; big models plus Google Earth can 
equal sluggish (like molasses in January) performance, and no one wants that.
Understanding the process
Very simply, building SketchUp models for Google Earth involves the follow-
ing steps:
 
1. Choosing a site in Google Earth.
 
2. Importing the view into SketchUp.
 
3. Building a model using the imported view as a guide.
 
4. Exporting your model to Google Earth.
Simple, huh? Figure 11-3 is a handy diagram for the visually oriented among us.

Finding a site and bringing 
it into SketchUp
Follow these steps to import a building site into SketchUp from Google Earth:
 
1. Launch Google Earth.
 
 Make sure that you’re online when you launch Earth; if you aren’t, you 
won’t be able to see much of anything.

322
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
2. In Google Earth, navigate to the area where you want to place a 
model.
 
 It doesn’t really matter how you get where you’re going; the important 
thing is to fill your Google Earth window with the area that you want to 
import into SketchUp. Take a look at Figure 11-4 to see what I mean.
 
Figure 11-4: 
Whatever 
you can see 
in Google 
Earth (left) 
is what gets 
imported 
into your 
SketchUp 
modeling 
window 
(right).
 
 
3. Launch SketchUp and open a new file.
 
 SketchUp opens a new file every time you launch it, so this step is 
pretty easy.
 
4. Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Get Current View from the menu bar.
 
 When you do this, SketchUp imports a “snapshot” of whatever is visible 
in your Google Earth window when you choose Get Current View.
 
If you want to import another snapshot from Google Earth into SketchUp, 
you can. SketchUp automatically tiles together all the snapshots you “take” 
(by choosing Get Current View) in your modeling window to form a kind of 
patchwork. This is super-handy if you find that you didn’t get everything you 
needed the first time.
 
You should know that you must be relatively close to the ground to take a 
snapshot; if you try to capture an area from too high up, things won’t work. 
Also, wait until your Google Earth view is at least 95 percent loaded before 
you can capture a snapshot in SketchUp. (Patience is a virtue, after all.) Just 
watch the little Streaming readout at the bottom of your Google Earth window 
to know when you’ve waited long enough.

323
 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
Modeling on a Google Earth snapshot
Now that you’ve imported a snapshot from Google Earth, you can build a 
model on it. To do this, just go about your SketchUp business the way you 
always do — everything about SketchUp stays exactly the same, even after 
you import a snapshot.
To follow the steps in this section, you need to know how to do some basics, 
such as how to use the Line tool to trace a building’s footprint, work with the 
drawing axes, and more. I cover these basics in detail in Chapter 2.
Building on top of a snapshot 101
Here are the basic steps for building a model on top of your Google Earth 
snapshot:
 
1. Make sure that you have a flat view of your terrain.
 
 Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Toggle Terrain a couple of times to figure 
out which is the flat view, and then start from there.
 
2. Trace the footprint of the building you want to model on the imported 
black-and-white image. See image A in Figure 11-5.
 
 Of course, you’re more than welcome to model something that doesn’t 
exist yet; if that’s the case, feel free to draw anything you like.

324
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
 If the building you’re trying to make doesn’t line up perfectly with the 
colored axes, using the Line and Rectangle tools can be tricky. To fix this 
problem, reposition your main drawing axes by choosing Tools➪Axes. 
Click once to set your origin, again to establish the direction of your red 
axis (parallel to one of the edges in your photo), and a third time to 
establish your green axis. I like to set my origin at the corner of the 
building I’m trying to make; I think it makes things easier.
 
3. Use Push/Pull to extrude the footprint to the correct height (see image 
B in Figure 11-5).
 
4. Keep modeling until you’re satisfied with what you have.
 
5. Flip to a 3D view of your terrain (choose Tools➪Google Earth➪
Toggle Terrain), and then move your building up or down until it’s 
sitting properly (see Figure 11-6).
 
 Select everything you want to move, and then use the Move tool to move 
it up or down. You can press the up- or down-arrow key to constrain 
your move to the blue axis if you want.
 
 If you have a SketchUp model you’ve already built that you’d like to 
export to Google Earth, just import it into the same file as your snap-
shot. Choose File➪Import from the menu bar, find it on your computer, 
and bring it on in.

 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
Letting SketchUp take care of the details
My favorite part of the whole Google Earth import process is how much time 
it saves. There’s a whole bunch of information already in Google Earth, and 
SketchUp is smart enough to take advantage of it:
 
✓ SketchUp geolocates your position automatically. This means that it 
sets your latitude and longitude to match Google Earth, and orients your 
snapshot in the right cardinal direction. This means that any shadow 
studies you do with the Shadows feature will automatically be accurate 
for wherever you were in Google Earth when you took your snapshot.
 
✓ Everything’s already the right size. Perhaps you take a snapshot of a 
football field in Google Earth; when you measure that football field in 
SketchUp, it will be exactly 100 yards long. That’s because SketchUp 
scales your snapshot to the correct size as part of the import process.
 
✓ There’s more to snapshots than meets the eye. The snapshot that 
SketchUp imports from Google Earth is more than just a black-and-white 
aerial photo — it also includes a chunk of topography called terrain. The 
terrain is flat when you first import it because it’s easier to build on that 
way, but you can toggle between flat and 3D (not flat) views by choos-
ing Tools➪Google Earth➪Toggle Terrain. Don’t fret if you don’t see any 
difference when you flip between the views — you probably just chose 
a flat site. Figure 11-7 shows the same snapshot with terrain toggled off 
(top) and on (bottom).

Thinking big by thinking small
When it comes to modeling for Google Earth, lightness is next to godli-
ness. By light, I mean the file size of your model, and by file size, I mean the 
number of faces and textures you use to build it. The more complicated your 
model, the slower Google Earth will run, and the more likely you’ll be to 

326
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
throw your computer through a window in frustration. Now more than ever, 
think about how you can do the most with the least — geometry, that is. 
Follow these tips:
 
✓ Get rid of extra geometry. Lots of times when you’re modeling, you end 
up with edges (and even faces) that don’t have a purpose. Figure 11-8 
shows a prime example of the kinds of little edges you can erase to dras-
tically reduce the number of faces in your model.
 
✓ Reduce the number of sides in your extruded arcs and circles. 
SketchUp’s default number of sides for circles is 24. This means that 
every time you use Push/Pull to extrude a circle into a cylinder, you 
end up with 25 faces: 24 around the sides and the original one on top. 
Instead of using circles with 24 sides, reduce the number of sides by 
typing a number followed by the letter s and pressing Enter right after 
you draw a circle. For example, to draw a 10-sided circle (plenty for 
Google Earth), follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a circle with the Circle tool.
 
2. Type 10s (this should appear in the lower-right corner of your 
modeling window), and then press Enter.
 
 The same thing goes for arcs; you change the number of sides in them in 
exactly the same way. I like to use 10-sided circles and 4-sided arcs when 
I’m modeling for Google Earth. Figure 11-9 shows the same pipe con-
structed by using Follow Me on two circles: one with 24 sides and one 
with only 10. Note the difference in the number of faces in each version.
 
✓ When you can, use photo detail instead of geometry. This really only 
applies if you’re mapping photos (or using SketchUp’s photo-matching 
feature) on the model you’re making for Google Earth. If you are, it’s a 
good idea to make as basic a model as you can, and let the detail in the 
photo “do the talking.” Resist the temptation to model windows and 
doors. Figure 11-10 shows a model I built for Google Earth. The view on 
the left shows it with photo textures visible; the version on the right is 
just the simple geometry. Surprised? You can read all about how to use 
photos to add detail to your models in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Limit the size of your photo textures. Be sure to take a look at the side-
bar “Photomodelers rejoice” in Chapter 8, for a rundown on some new 
tools that Google introduced for SketchUp 7. Basically, photos that you 
use to paint your models can be heavy, so you should make sure that 
you’re only saving the parts of them that you need — pay special atten-
tion to the new Make Unique Textures command.

Viewing your model in Google Earth
After you’ve made a model on top of a snapshot, it’s a simple operation to 
send it over to your copy of Google Earth. And after you’ve done that, you 
can save it as a Google Earth KMZ file and e-mail it to all your friends. If 
you’re modeling for clients instead of friends, you can send it to them, too.
Exporting from SketchUp to Google Earth
This process is so simple you could probably figure it out while you’re talk-
ing on the phone. Follow these steps to send your model from SketchUp to 
Google Earth on your computer:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Google Earth➪Place Model.
 
 Doing this sends everything in your modeling window (with the excep-
tion of the Google Earth snapshot) over to Google Earth. Your computer 
should automatically switch you over to Google Earth and fly you in so 
that you’re looking at your model (see Figure 11-11).
 
2. If you decide you want to make changes to your model, go back to 
SketchUp, make your changes, and then choose Place Model again.
 
 Google Earth pops up a dialog box that asks you whether you want to 
overwrite the old version of the model you placed the first time.
 
3. Click the Yes button if you’re sure that’s what you want to do.
 
4. Continue to go back and forth between SketchUp and Google Earth 
until your model looks exactly the way you want it to.

Saving your model as a Google Earth KMZ file
You can save your SketchUp model as a Google Earth KMZ file that you can 
send to anyone. When someone opens the KMZ file, Google Earth opens on 
his computer (if he has Google Earth), and he is “flown in” to look at the 
model you made. Try sending directions to your next party this way; your 
friends will think you’re related to Albert Einstein. Follow these steps to save 
your model:
 
1. In Google Earth, select your model by clicking it in the Temporary

Becoming a SketchUp All-Star 
with the 3D Warehouse
If you’ve ever wondered where Google gets most of the realistic buildings 
that show up by default on the 3D Buildings layer in Google Earth, you should 
go take a look in the mirror. That’s right: Google’s strategy for building the 
whole man-made world in 3D is to rely on SketchUp users everywhere to 
model their local context. That’s the biggest reason that SketchUp is a free 
program, and it’s a pretty revolutionary way to think about tackling a mas-
sive project: millions of people working together to provide accurate, current 
information that can be used by anyone.
Getting to the Google 3D Warehouse
So how can you get your models into Google Earth so that everyone can see 
them? To do that, you need to upload your work into the 3D Warehouse. 
Residing wherever Google’s other jillions of bits of data do, the 3D 
Warehouse is a huge collection of 3D models that is searchable and, most 
importantly, free for everyone to use.
The 3D Warehouse is basically a Web site; it exists online, and you need an 
Internet connection to access it. You can get there in two different ways:
 
✓ From SketchUp: Choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Get Models; when you do, 
a mini Web browser opens right in front of your modeling window. Voilà!
 
✓ From the Web: Browse to http://sketchup.google.
com/3dwarehouse. This is a great way to hunt for 3D models without 
having to open SketchUp first.
Go ahead and poke around the 3D Warehouse. It’s amazing what you’ll 
find; thousands of people are adding new content every day. Most of it isn’t 
very useful, but you’ll still find plenty of interesting things to download 
and look at. I don’t explain all the ins and outs of the 3D Warehouse in this 
book because I think it’s pretty self-explanatory. However, if you need more 
information, check out the online Help — it’s at the bottom of your browser 
window when you’re in the 3D Warehouse.

331
 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
Uploading your models
You can break the models in the 3D Warehouse into two broad categories:
 
✓ Geolocated: Things like buildings, monuments, bridges, and dams exist 
in a specific geographic location; they never move around. These are 
the kinds of models that show up on the 3D Buildings layer in Google 
Earth, and the 3D Warehouse is where they come from. To upload your 
own geolocated models, you need to start with a Google Earth snapshot; 
this provides the geolocation information that Google needs to put your 
model in the right place. Check out the section “Building Models for 
Google Earth,” earlier in this chapter, for a blow-by-blow account of how 
to build geolocated models that you can upload to the 3D Warehouse.
 
✓ Nongeolocated: Objects like toasters, SUVs, wheelchairs, and sofas 
aren’t unique, and they don’t exist in any one geographic location. No 
physical address is associated with a model of a Honda Accord because 
millions of them exist, and because Honda Accords move around. Stuff 
like this never shows up in Google Earth because the folks at Google 
wouldn’t know where to put it. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t belong in 
the 3D Warehouse, though; models of nongeolocated stuff are incredibly 
valuable for people who are making their own SketchUp models. When I 
modeled my house, I furnished it with couches, beds, and other models I 
found in the Warehouse.
Follow these steps to upload your own model to the Google 3D Warehouse:
 
1. Open the model you want to upload in SketchUp.
Minding your modeling manners
People sometimes ask me if anyone at Google is 
paying attention to what gets uploaded to the 3D 
Warehouse. The answer to that question is a little 
bit complicated. For instance, nobody at Google 
minds if you refer to a Web site or enter tags that 
don’t have anything to do with the model you 
upload — stuff like that is entirely up to you.
On the other hand, it’s very frowned upon to 
go anywhere near the usual taboo subjects for 
public, G-rated Web sites: pornography and/or 
foul language will sound an alarm somewhere 
at Google that will get your model yanked off the 
3D Warehouse quicker than you can say “First 
Amendment.” Tens of thousands of impres-
sionable, young eyeballs peruse Google’s Web 
sites every day, so it behooves Google to keep 
those sites clean. If you have kids, I’m sure you 
understand.

332
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Making sure your models get accepted
When it comes to getting your models accepted 
into Google Earth’s 3D Buildings layer (so that 
everyone in the world can see them), it helps 
to know the reasons models sometimes get 
rejected:
 ✓ Terrain problems: When the terrain you 
import from Google Earth doesn’t cut it, you 
might have to “build up” the terrain around 
your building by modeling it in SketchUp. 
When you do, make sure it’s textured 
with a good-quality aerial photograph that 
matches (more or less) the existing imagery 
in Google Earth. Also make sure to model 
only what you absolutely need for your 
building — if it’s too big, it won’t fly.
 ✓ There’s already another model in Google 
Earth: Before you submit your model for 
consideration, check Google Earth to make 
sure there isn’t already a version of your 
building on the 3D Buildings layer. If there 
is, your model will need to be better than 
what’s already there in order to replace it.
 ✓ Photo-texture problems: Use good photo-
graphs as textures when you’re modeling, 
and be sure to position them accurately. 
Take a look at Chapter 8 for the whole 
scoop.
 ✓ Scale and position problems: This might 
seem obvious, but it’s a common occur-
rence; if your model isn’t the same size as 
it is in the aerial imagery in Google Earth, it 
won’t be accepted. It also needs to appear 
in the correct spot — right on top of its own 
photo in Google Earth.
 ✓ Your building doesn’t exist: If the build-
ing you submit doesn’t appear in Google 
Earth’s aerial imagery, chances are good 
that it’ll get the big thumbs-down. If it really 
does exist, include web links to images of 
the building in its surroundings in the model 
description when you upload it to the 3D 
Warehouse. If it’s still under construction, 
include a link to somewhere on the web 
that details when it’s due to be completed.
 ✓ Floating problems: This one’s simple — 
make sure your building isn’t floating above 
the ground in Google Earth. It should be 
sunken into the ground just enough to 
appear realistic.
 ✓ Ads: You can’t include ads or other visual 
“spam” on your models. If the building has 
a mural or a billboard on it, that’s OK, but 
the ad has to be part of the original photo 
texture on the model — it has to be a part 
of the structure in real life.
 ✓ Too much stuff: Don’t include extras like 
cars, trees, streetlamps, people, or any-
thing else that isn’t a part of the building 
when you upload it.
 ✓ Z-fighting: When two faces are in the plane, 
they flash when you orbit your model. This 
is called Z-fighting, and it’s as common as 
dirt. If you see this phenomenon, there’s a 
good chance you slipped up and chose Use 
as Image instead of Use as Texture when 
you imported the image into your model — 
resulting in two co-planar faces. Check out 
“Adding photos to faces” in Chapter 8 for 
the right way to apply images when you’re 
modeling.
 ✓ Your model’s too big: Take a look at 
“Thinking big by thinking small,” earlier in 
this chapter, for tips on minimizing the size 
of what you make. Remember: In Google 
Earth, smaller files are always better.

333
 Chapter 11: Working with Google Earth and the 3D Warehouse
 
2. Fiddle around with your view until you like what you see.
 
 When you upload a model to the 3D Warehouse, SketchUp automatically 
creates a preview image that’s a snapshot of your modeling window.
 
3. Choose File➪3D Warehouse➪Share Model.
 
 A mini-browser window opens, and it shows the logon screen for the 3D 
Warehouse. If you want to upload models, you need a Google account. 
They’re free; you just need a valid e-mail address to get one. If you don’t 
already have one, follow the on-screen instructions to sign up.
 
 When you’re creating your Google account, be sure to type something in 
where the system asks for a “nickname.” If you don’t, everything you 
upload will be attributed to “Anonymous.”
 
4. Enter your Google account information and click the Sign In button.
 
5. Fill out the Upload to 3D Warehouse form as completely as you can:
 
• Title: Enter a title for your model. If it’s a public building, you 
might enter its name. Something like “Royal West Academy” would 
do nicely.
 
• Description: Models with complete descriptions are very popular 
with people who are hunting around the Warehouse. Try to use 
complete sentences here; the more you write, the better.
 
• Tags: Type in a string of words that describe the thing you mod-
eled. The 3D Warehouse search engine uses whatever you enter 
here to help people find your model. To increase the number of 
people who see what you made, add lots of tags. If I were upload-
ing a modern coffee table, I’d enter the following tags: coffee table, 
table, coffee, modern, living room, furniture, glass, chrome, metal, 
steel. You get the idea — be exhaustive.
 
• Address: This field only appears if your model is geolocated, mean-
ing that you started with a Google Earth snapshot. If you know the 
physical address of the thing you made, type it in.
 
• Google Earth Ready: You only get this option if your model is geo-
located. If your model is accurate, correctly sized, and in the right 
location, and if you want it to be considered for inclusion on the 
default 3D Buildings layer of Google Earth, select this check box. If 
you do, the folks at Google will consider adding it to Google Earth. 
Keep your fingers crossed!
 
• Web Site: If you have a Web-site address that you’d like people 
who view your model to visit, enter it here. For example, if your 
model is a historic building, you might include the Web site that 
provides more information about it.

334
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
6. Click the Upload button to add your model to the 3D Warehouse.
 
 If everything works properly, you should get a page with your model on 
it, along with all the information you just entered. The words “Model has 
been uploaded successfully” will be highlighted in yellow at the top of 
your browser window. Congratulations — you’re now a member of the 
worldwide 3D community.
 
 You can’t upload just any old model to the 3D Warehouse, unfortu-
nately. At the time I was working on this book, the maximum file size you 
could upload was 10MB, which is actually pretty big. You can check 
your model’s file size in Explorer (on a Windows machine) or in Finder 
(on a Mac).

Printing Your Work
In This Chapter
▶ Printing views of your model
▶ Figuring out the printing dialog boxes
▶ Printing to scale
A
s much as everyone likes to pretend that we all live in an all-digital 
world, the ugly truth is that we don’t. People use more paper now than 
they ever have; I have a stack of junk prints on the coffee table in front of 
me as I’m writing this. It’s not that I have anything against trees — it’s just 
that printing is so satisfying. I love having something I can fold up and put in 
my pocket, or stick to the fridge, or mail to my Luddite relatives. Computer 
screens are nice, but in most people’s minds, paper is real.
In this chapter I talk about how to print views of your SketchUp model. 
Because the Windows and Mac versions of this procedure are so different, 
I dedicate a whole section to each platform. The last part of this chapter is 
devoted to scaled printing — a topic that can sometimes make experienced 
architects nervous. SketchUp makes printing to scale a little harder than it 
could be, but it’s still a whole lot better than drawing things by hand.
 
If you’re using the Pro version of SketchUp, you can always use LayOut to 
print views of your models. LayOut makes it a lot easier to make both scaled 
and non-scaled prints; take a look at the last part of Chapter 14 for all the juicy 
details.
Printing from a Windows Computer
It’s very easy to print from SketchUp, as long as you’re not trying to do any-
thing too complicated. By complicated, I mean printing to a particular scale, 
which can be a harrowing experience the first couple of times you attempt it. 
Fortunately, printing to scale is something most people almost never have to 
do, so I’ve included instructions for how to do it at the end of this chapter.

336
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Making a basic print (Windows)
Most of the time, all you need to do is print exactly what you see on your 
screen. Follow these steps to do that:
 
1. Make sure that you have the view you want to print in your modeling 
window.
 
 Unless you’re printing to scale (which I cover in the last part of this 
chapter), SketchUp prints exactly what you see in your modeling 
window.
 
2. Choose File➪Print Setup.
 
 This opens the Print Setup dialog box, which is where you make choices 
about what printer and paper you want to print to.
 
3. In the Print Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-1), do the following:
 
a. Choose the printer you’d like to use.
 
b. Choose a paper size for your print.
 
c. Choose an orientation for your print; most of the time, you’ll want 
to use Landscape, because your screen is usually wider than it 
is tall.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Print 
Setup dia-
log box in 
Windows.
 
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Print Setup dialog box.
 
5. Choose File➪Print Preview.
 
 This opens the Print Preview dialog box. As an exact copy of the Print 
dialog box, Print Preview lets you see an image of what your print will 
look like before you send it to a printer. Lots of trees will thank you for 
saving paper by using Print Preview every time you print.

337
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Work
 
6. In the Print Preview dialog box, do the following:
 
a. In the Tabbed Scene Print Range area, choose which scenes you’d 
like to print, if you have more than one. If you need to, you can 
read all about scenes in Chapter 10.
 
b. Tell SketchUp how many copies of each scene you need.
 
c. Make sure that the Fit to Page check box is selected.
 
d. Make sure that the Use Model Extents check box isn’t selected.
 
e. Choose a print quality for your printout. (I recommend High 
Definition for most jobs.)
 
 For a complete description of all the knobs and doohickeys in the Print 
Preview and Print dialog boxes, have a look at the next section in this 
chapter.
 
7. Click the OK button. 
 
 The Print Preview dialog box closes and you get an on-screen preview of 
what your print will look like.
 
8. If you like what you see, click the Print button in the upper-left corner 
of the Print Preview window to open the Print dialog box.
 
 If you don’t like what you’re about to print, click the Close button (at the 
top of the screen) and go back to Step 1.
 
9. In the Print dialog box (which should look exactly like the Print 
Preview dialog box), click the OK button. 
 
 Your print job goes to the printer.
Decoding the Windows Print dialog box
Three cheers for simplicity! The Print Preview and Print dialog boxes in 
SketchUp are exactly the same. Figure 12-2 shows the former, because that’s 
the one I advocate using first every time, but the descriptions in this section 
apply to both.
Printer
If you used the Print Setup dialog box first, you shouldn’t need to change any 
of the settings in this section. If you want, from the drop-down list you can 
choose which printer to use. If you know something about printers, you can 
even click the Properties button to make adjustments to your printer settings. 
(Because settings are different for every printer on Earth, that’s between you 
and your printer’s user manual — I’m afraid I can’t be of much help.)

Tabbed Scene Print Range
Use this area to tell SketchUp which of your scenes you’d like to print, if you 
have more than one. This option is really handy for quickly printing all your 
scenes. Select the Current View option to only print whatever’s currently in 
your modeling window.
Copies
This one’s pretty basic: Choose how many copies of each view you’d like to 
print. If you’re printing multiple copies of multiple scenes, select the Collate 
check box to print packets, which can save you from having to assemble 
them yourself. Here’s what happens when you’re printing three copies of four 
scenes:
 
✓ Selecting the Collate check box prints the pages in the following order: 
123412341234.
 
✓ Deselecting the Collate check box prints the pages like this: 
111222333444.
Print Size
This is, by far, the most complicated part of this dialog box; Print Size con-
trols how your model will look on the printed page. Figure 12-3 shows the 
effect of some of these settings on a final print.

Fit to Page
Fit to Page and Use Model Extents
The Print Size controls are as follows:
 
✓ Fit to Page: Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to make your printed 
page look like your Modeling Window. As long as the Use Model Extents 
check box isn’t selected, you should be able to see exactly what you see 
on your screen — no more, no less.

340
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
✓ Use Model Extents: I have to admit that I don’t like this option; I almost 
never select it. All this does is tell SketchUp to zoom in to make your 
model (excluding your sky, ground, watermark, and whatever else might 
be visible on your screen) fit the printed page. If I want this effect, I just 
use choose Camera➪Zoom Extents from the menu bar before I print my 
model; it’s easier, and I know exactly what I’m getting.
 
✓ Page Size: As long as you don’t have the Fit to Page check box selected, 
you can manually enter a page size using these controls. If you type in a 
width or height, SketchUp figures out the other dimension and pretends 
it’s printing on a different-sized piece of paper.
 
 The Page Size option is especially useful if you want to make a big print 
by tiling together lots of smaller pages. See the next section in this chap-
ter for more details.
 
✓ Scale: Here’s where it gets a little complicated. To print to scale, you 
have to do two things before you go anywhere near the Print or Print 
Preview dialog boxes:
 
• Switch to Parallel Projection mode.
 
• Make sure that you’re using one of the Standard views.
 
 Take a look at the section “Printing to scale (Windows and Mac),” later 
in this chapter, for a complete rundown on printing to scale in SketchUp.
Tiled Sheet Print Range
Perhaps you’re printing at a scale that won’t fit on a single page, or you’ve 
entered a print size that’s bigger than the paper size you chose in the Print 
Setup dialog box. The Tiled Sheet Print Range area lets you print your image 
on multiple sheets and then attach them together later. You can get posters 
from your small-format printer!
Print Quality
To be honest, I think there’s a little bit of voodoo involved in selecting a print 
quality for your image. What you get with each setting depends a lot on 
your model, so you should probably try out a couple different settings if you 
have time. 
 
✓ Draft and Standard are really only useful for making sure your model 
appears the way you want it to on the printed page. 
 
✓ I recommend using High Definition first, then bumping up to Ultra High 
Definition if your computer/printer setup can handle it.

341
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Work
Other settings
You can control the following odds-and-ends settings in the Print Preview 
dialog box, too:
 
✓ 2-D Section Slice Only: If you have a visible section cut in your model 
view, selecting this check box tells SketchUp to only print the section 
cut edges. Figure 12-4 shows what the same model view would look like 
without (on the left) and with (right) this option selected. I use this to 
produce simple plan and section views that I can sketch on by hand.
 
✓ Use High Accuracy HLR: The bad news is that I have no idea what HLR 
stands for. The good news is that it doesn’t really matter. Selecting 
this check box tells SketchUp to send vector information to the printer 
instead of the usual raster data. (Check out Chapter 13 for a description 
of what these terms mean.) Why should you care? Vector lines look 
much smoother and cleaner when printed, so your whole model will 
look better — with one condition: Gradients (those nice, smooth shad-
ows on rounded surfaces) don’t print well as vectors. If you have a lot of 
rounded or curvy surfaces in your model view, you probably don’t want 
to choose this option. Try a print both ways and choose the one that 
looks better. Thank goodness for Print Preview, huh?
 
 If your model view includes a sketchy edges style, don’t use high accuracy 
HLR; you won’t see any of the nice, sketchy effects in your final print.

Printing from a Mac
If you’re using a Mac, the printing story is a little simpler than it is for folks 
who use Windows computers — but only by a little. The first part of the fol-
lowing sections lays out a procedure for generating a simple, straightforward 

342
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
print of what you see in your Modeling Window. The second part could be 
called “Gross anatomy of the Mac Document Setup dialog box”; this is where 
I go into some detail about what each and every setting does.
Making a basic print (Mac)
Follow these steps to print exactly what you see in your Modeling Window 
on a Mac:
 
1. Make sure that your modeling window contains whatever you want to 
print.
 
 SketchUp prints exactly what you see in your Modeling Window, unless 
of course you’re printing to scale. This is considerably more compli-
cated, so I gave it a whole section at the end of this chapter.
 
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
 
 This opens the Page Setup dialog box, where you decide what printer 
and paper size to use.
 
3. In the Page Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-5), do the following:
 
a. Choose the printer you’d like to use from the Format For drop-
down list.
 
b. Choose a paper size for your print.
 
c. Choose an orientation for your print. I usually end up using the 
second or third one (Landscape), because my Modeling Window is 
usually wider than it is tall.
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Page Setup dialog box.
 
5. Choose File➪Document Setup.
 
 This opens the Document Setup dialog box.
 
Figure 12-5: 
The Page 
Setup dialog 
box on a 
Mac lets 
you select 
a printer, a

343
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Work
 
6. In the Document Setup dialog box, make sure that the Fit View to Page 
check box is selected.
 
 Check out the next section in this chapter for a full description of what 
everything does.
 
7. Click the OK button to close the Document Setup dialog box.
 
8. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
 
9. In the Print dialog box, click the Preview button.
 
 This generates an on-screen preview of what your print will look like on 
paper.
 
10. If the preview suits you, click the Print button to send your print job 
to the printer.
 
 If you’re not happy with the preview, click the Cancel button and start 
again at Step 1. Isn’t printing fun?
Deciphering the Mac printing dialog boxes
Because printing from SketchUp on a Mac involves two separate dialog 
boxes, I describe both in the following sections.
The Document Setup dialog box
You use the settings in the Document Setup dialog box (see Figure 12-6) to 
control how big your model prints. Here’s what everything does:
 
✓ Print Size: This one’s pretty self-explanatory, but here are some details 
just in case:
 
• Fit View to Page: Select this check box tells SketchUp to make 
your printed page look just like your Modeling Window on-screen. 
It’s really that simple.
 
• Width and Height: If the Fit View to Page check box is deselected, 
you can type in either a width or a height for your final print. This is 
the way to go if you want to print a tiled poster out of several sheets 
of paper; just enter a final size and you’ll have a poster in no time flat.
 
✓ Print Scale: Use these settings to control the scale of your printed draw-
ing, if that’s the kind of print you’re trying to make. Because printing to 
scale is a bit of an ordeal, I devote the last section of this chapter to the 
topic. Refer to that section for a description of what these settings do.
 
✓ Pages Required: This is really just a readout of how many pages you 
need to print. If you have selected the Fit View to Page check box, this 
should say 1. If your print won’t fit on one sheet, it will be tiled onto the 
number of sheets displayed in this section of the dialog box.

344
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
Figure 12-6: 
The Mac 
Document 
Setup 
dialog box.
 
The Print dialog box
The Print dialog box on the Mac is something of a many-headed beast; sev-
eral more panels are hidden underneath the Copies & Pages drop-down 
list. Luckily, you only need to use two. Both are pictured in Figure 12-7 and 
described in the following list:
 
✓ Copies & Pages panel: The controls in this part of the Print dialog box 
are pretty straightforward; use them to tell SketchUp how many copies 
and pages you want to print:
 
• Copies: If you’re printing more than one copy of a print that 
includes multiple pages, select the Collated check box to tell 
SketchUp to print packets, which can save you from having to col-
late them yourself.
 
• Pages: If the Pages Required readout at the bottom of the 
Document Setup dialog box said that you need more than one 
sheet to print your image, you can choose to print all or some of 
those pages right here.
 
✓ SketchUp panel: You use the settings in this panel to control the final 
appearance of your print:
 
• Print Quality: I usually set this to High, but the results you get 
depend a lot on your printer model. In general, I avoid Draft or 
Standard unless I’m just making sure my page will look the way I 
want it to. If you have time, try both High and Extra High and see 
which one looks the best.
 
• Vector Printing: When you select this option, SketchUp sends 
vector (instead of raster) information to the printer. Have a look at 
Chapter 13 for a description of these terms.
 
 The upshot here is that vector printing makes edges look much 
smoother and cleaner but does a lousy job on gradients (the shad-
ows on your curved surfaces). Use vector printing if your model 
view is made up of mostly flat faces, but try printing both ways 
(with vector printing on and off) to see which looks better.

345
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Work
 
 If your model view includes a sketchy edges style, don’t choose 
Vector Printing; you won’t see any of the nice, sketchy effects in 
your final print.
 
• Line Weight: This option only works if you’ve selected the Vector 
Printing check box. The number in this box represents the thick-
ness of edges in your print; any edges that are 1 pixel thick in your 
model view will be drawn with a line as thick as what you choose 
for this option. The default is 0.50 points, but feel free to experi-
ment to see what looks best for your model.

& Pages and

dialog box.
 
This doesn’t matter unless you’re using Vector Printing.

Printing to a Particular Scale
Here’s where printing gets interesting. Sometimes, instead of printing exactly 
what you see on your screen so that it fits on a sheet of paper, you might 
need to print a drawing to scale. See the nearby sidebar “Wrapping your head

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
Keep in mind that if you have SketchUp Pro, you can use LayOut to generate 
scaled views of your model very easily. Take a look at Chapter 14 for more 
information.
Preparing to print to scale
Before you can print a view of your model to a particular scale, you have to 
set things up properly. Here are some things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Perspective views can’t be printed to scale. If you think about it, this 
makes sense. In perspectival views, all lines appear to “go back” into 
the distance, which means that they look shorter than they really are. 
Because the whole point of a scaled drawing is to be able to take accu-
rate measurements directly off your printout, views with perspective 
don’t work.
 
✓ Switch to Parallel Projection if you want to print to scale. I know, I 
know — this is the same as the last point. But it’s important enough that 
I figure it’s worth mentioning twice. To change your viewing mode from 
Perspective to Parallel Projection, choose Camera➪Parallel Projection. 
That’s all there is to it.
 
✓ You have to use the Standard views. SketchUp lets you quickly look at 
your model from the top, bottom, and sides by switching to one of the 
Standard views. Choose Camera➪Standard and pick any of the views 
except Iso.
Printing to scale (Windows and Mac)
The steps in this section allow you to produce a scaled print from SketchUp; 
I give Windows instructions first, and then Mac. When the user-interface 
elements are different for the two platforms, the ones for Mac are shown in 
parentheses. Figure 12-8 shows the relevant dialog boxes for printing to scale 
in Windows and on a Mac.
 
Before you begin, make sure that you’ve switched to Parallel Projection and 
that your view is lined up the right way. See the previous section of this chap-
ter for the lowdown on what you need to do to prepare your model view for 
scaled printing. Follow these steps to produce a scaled print:
 
1. Choose File➪Print Setup (Page Setup).
 
2. Select a printer, paper size, and paper orientation. 
 
3. Click the OK button.
 
4. Choose File➪Print Preview (Document Setup).

347
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Work
 
5. Deselect the Fit to Page (Fit View to Page) check box.
 
6. Windows: Make sure that the Use Model Extents check box is deselected.
 
 Mac users don’t have this option.
 
7. Enter the scale at which you’d like to print your model view.
 
 If I want to print a drawing at 1/4-inch scale, I enter the following:
 
• 1 Inches into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
 
• 4 Feet into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
 
 If I want to produce a print at 1:100 scale, I enter the following:
 
• 1 m into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
 
• 100 m into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
 
8. Take note of how may pages you’ll need to print your drawing.
 
 If you’re using Windows, you can check this in the Tiled Sheet Print 
Range area of the dialog box. On a Mac, the number of pages you’ll need 
appears in the Pages Required section of the Document Setup dialog 
box. If you want to print on a different-sized piece of paper, change the 
setting in the Print Setup (Page Setup) dialog box.
Wrapping your head around scale
When you print to scale, anyone with a special 
ruler (called a scale, confusingly enough) can 
take measurements from your drawing, as long 
as he or she knows the scale at which it was 
printed. You can use three different kinds of 
drawing scales:
Architectural: In the United States, most people 
use feet and inches to measure objects. Most 
architectural scales substitute fractions of an 
inch for a foot. Three common examples of 
architectural scales follow:
 ✓ 1/2 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 2 feet)
 ✓ 1/4 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 4 feet)
 ✓ 1/8 inch = 1 foot (1 inch = 8 feet)
Engineering: When it comes to measuring big 
things like parcels of land and college cam-
puses, U.S. architects, engineers, and surveyors 
still use feet, but they use engineering scales 
instead of architectural ones. Three common 
engineering scales follow:
 ✓ 1 inch = 20 feet
 ✓ 1 inch = 50 feet
 ✓ 1 inch = 100 feet
Metric: Outside of the United States, virtually 
everyone uses the metric system. Because all 
measurement is based on the number 10, metric 
scales can be applied to everything from very 
small things (blood cells) to very big things 
(countries). Metric scales use ratios instead of 
units of measure. Here are three examples:
 ✓ 1:10 (The objects in the drawing are 10 times 
bigger in real life.)
 ✓ 1:100 (The objects in the drawing are 100 
times bigger in real life.)
 ✓ 10:1 (The objects in the drawing are 10 times 
smaller in real life.)

9. If you want to print your drawing on a single sheet and it won’t fit, try 
using a smaller scale.
 
 Using the 1/4 inch = 1 foot example, try shrinking the drawing to 3/16 inch = 
1 foot scale. To do this, enter the following:
 
• 3 Inches into the In the Printout (In Drawing) box
 
• 16 Feet into the In SketchUp (In Model) box
 
10. When you’re happy with how your drawing will print, click the OK 
button.
 
11. Perform the step based on your computer:
 
• Windows: If you like what you see in the Print Preview window, 
click the Print button (in the upper-left corner) to open the Print 
dialog box.
 
• Mac: Choose File➪Print.
 
12. In the Print dialog box, click the OK button to send your print job to 
the printer.
Refer to this chapter’s “Making a basic print” section (for your operating 
system) for the whole story on basic printing from SketchUp.

W
ant to e-mail a JPEG of your new patio to your parents? How about 
a movie that shows what it’s like to walk out onto that new patio? If 
you need an image or a movie of your model, forget about viewing or printing 
within SketchUp. Exporting is the way to go.
SketchUp can export both still images and animations in most of the major 
graphics and movie formats. Here’s the part that’s a little bit confusing: 
Which file formats you can export depend on the version of SketchUp you 
have. If you have regular ol’ Google SketchUp (the free one), you can create 
raster image files as well as movies. If you’ve sprung for Google SketchUp Pro, 
you can also export vector files and a whole bunch of 3D formats; I talk about 
all of them in the online Bonus Chapter for this book. (See the Introduction 
for details about what’s online and where to find it.)
In this chapter, I talk about the export file formats that are common to both 
versions of Google SketchUp. Just in case you’re not familiar with the terms 
raster and vector, I give brief definitions of each. Then I go into some detail 
about the 2D raster image formats that you can create with SketchUp. I spend 
the last part of this chapter talking about exporting animations as movie files 
that anyone can open and view.
Exporting 2D Images of Your Model
Even though the free version of SketchUp can only export 2D views of your 
model as raster images, I think it’s helpful to know a little bit about graph-
ics file formats in general. If you’re already an aficionado about these sorts 
of things, or if you’re in a big hurry, you can skip ahead to the section 
“Exporting a raster image from SketchUp.”

350
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
If you have SketchUp Pro, you have a much better way to get images out of 
SketchUp: LayOut. In fact, LayOut might even be able to replace whatever 
application is the reason you’re trying to export an image in the first place. 
Take a look at Chapter 14 for the whole story.
Pictures on your computer are divided into two basic flavors: raster and 
vector. The difference between these two categories of file types has to do 
with how they store image information. Here’s the one-minute version:
 
✓ Raster: Raster images are made up of dots. (Technically, these dots are 
called pixels, just like the pixels that make up images you take with a 
digital camera.) Raster file formats consist of information about the loca-
tion and color of each dot. When you export a raster, you decide how 
many dots (pixels) it should include, which directly affects how big it 
can be displayed. SketchUp exports TIFF, JPEG, and PNG raster images; 
the Windows version also exports BMPs, although that’s nothing to get 
excited about. You can read more about raster images in the sidebar 
“Understanding rasters: Lots and lots of dots,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Vector: Vector images consist of instructions written in computer 
code. This code describes how to draw the image to whatever software 
is trying to open it. The major advantage of using vector imagery (as 
opposed to raster) lies in its scalability — vectors can be resized larger 
or smaller without affecting their image quality, while rasters lose qual-
ity if you enlarge them too much. The free version of SketchUp can 
only export raster images, but SketchUp Pro can export vectors in both 
PDF and EPS file formats; you can read all about it in the online Bonus 
Chapter 1.
Exporting a raster image from SketchUp
The process of exporting a view of your SketchUp model is fairly straightfor-
ward. Depending on which format you choose, the export options are slightly 
different, but I address all of them in this section.
Follow these steps to export a raster image from SketchUp:
 
1. Adjust your model view until you see exactly what you’d like to export 
as an image file.
 
 SketchUp’s raster image export is WYSIWYG — What You See Is What 
You Get. Basically, your entire modeling window view is exported as 
an image, so use the navigation tools or click on a scene to set up your 
view. Use styles, shadows, and fog to make your model look exactly the 
way you want it to. To change the proportions of your image, resize your 
SketchUp window. Follow these steps to do so:

351
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
 
1. Windows only: If your SketchUp window is full screen, click the 
Minimize button in its upper-right corner.
 
2. Drag the Resize tab in the lower-right corner of your SketchUp 
window until the modeling window is the right proportion.
 
 In Figure 13-1, I want to export a wide view of a house I modeled, so I 
adjust the proportions of my modeling window until things look right.

SketchUp Modeling Window
Exported Image
 
 You might be wondering whether everything in your modeling window 
shows up in an exported raster image. The red, green, and blue axes 
don’t, which is good, but guides do, which is usually bad. If you don’t 
want your guides to be visible in your exported image, deselect Guides 
in the View menu.
 
2. Choose File➪Export➪2D Graphic.
 
 This opens the File Export dialog box.
 
3. Choose the file format you’d like to use from the Format drop-down list.
 
 Before you go ahead and choose JPEG by default, you should know that 
this file type isn’t always the best choice. For a complete description of 
each format (as well as recommendations for when to choose each), see 
the section “Looking at SketchUp’s raster formats,” later in this chapter.

352
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
4. Choose a name and a location on your computer for your exported 
image.
 
5. Click the Options button.
 
 This opens the Export Options dialog box, where you can control how 
your image is exported. Figure 13-2 shows what this dialog box looks like 
for each of SketchUp’s raster file formats.
 
6. Adjust the settings in the Export Options dialog box.
 
 Here’s a description of what the settings do:
 
• Use View Size: Selecting this check box tells SketchUp to export an 
image file that contains the same number of pixels as are currently 
being used to display your model on-screen. If you’re just planning 
to use your exported image in an e-mail or in an on-screen pre-
sentation (like PowerPoint), you select Use View Size, but it’s still 
better to manually control the pixel size of your exported image. 
If you’re planning to print your exported image, don’t select this 
check box — whatever you do.
 
• Width and Height: When you don’t select the Use View Size 
check box, you can manually enter the size of your exported 
image. Because this process requires a fair amount of figuring, 
I’ve devoted a whole section to it; take a look at “Making sure that 
you’re exporting enough pixels,” later in this chapter, to find out 
what to type into the Width and Height boxes.
 
• Anti-alias: Because raster images use grids of colored squares 
to draw pictures, diagonal lines and edges can sometimes look 
jagged and, well . . . lousy. Anti-aliasing is a process that fills in the 
gaps around pixels with similar-colored pixels so that things look 
smooth. Figure 13-3 illustrates the concept. In general, you want to 
leave anti-aliasing on.
 
• Resolution (Mac only): This is where you tell SketchUp how big 
each pixel should be, and therefore how big (in inches or centi-
meters) your exported image should be. Pixel size is expressed in 
terms of pixels per inch/centimeter. This option is only available 
when the Use View Size check box isn’t selected. Just as with the 
Width and Height boxes, I go into a lot of detail about image resolu-
tion in the next section of this chapter.
 
• Transparent Background (Mac only, not for JPEGs): Mac users 
can choose to export TIFFs and PNGs with transparent back-
grounds, which can make it easier to “cut out” your model in 
another piece of software. Exporting your image with a transparent 
background is also a nice way to use image-editing programs like 
Photoshop to drop in a sky and ground plane later on. It’s too bad 
this isn’t available for Windows users; it’s a really handy feature.

353
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
 
• JPEG Compression (JPEG only): This slider lets you decide two 
things at the same time: the file size of your exported image and 
how good the image will look. The two are, of course, inversely 
related; the farther to the left you move the slider, the smaller your 
file will be, but the worse it will look. I never set JPEG compression 
any lower than 8 — my models take too long to build for me to 
make them look terrible on export.
 
7. Click the OK button to close the Export Options dialog box.
 
8. Back in the File Export dialog box, click the Export button to export 
your raster image file.
 
 You can find your exported file in whatever location on your computer 
you specified in Step 4. What you do with it is entirely up to you — you 
can e-mail it, print it, or use it in another software program to create a 
presentation.
 
 Don’t be alarmed if the export process takes longer than you think it 
should. If you’re exporting a pretty big image (one with lots and lots of 
pixels), the export will take a while. Take the opportunity to call your 
mother — she’ll appreciate it.

Looking at SketchUp’s raster formats
So you know you need to export a raster image from SketchUp, but which 
one do you choose? You have four choices in Windows; three of them are 
available on the Mac. The following sections give you the details.
 
When you export a raster image, you’re saving your current view in SketchUp 
to a separate file somewhere on your computer. As a raster image, that file 
consists of tiny, colored dots called pixels — more pixels than you can shake a 
stick at. When you look at all the pixels together, they form an image.
Tagged Image File (TIFF or TIF)
TIFFs are the stalwarts of the raster image file format world; everyone can 
read them and just about everyone can create them. TIFF stands for Tagged 
Image File Format, but that’s hardly important. Here’s everything you need to 
know about TIFFs:
 
✓ When image quality is important, choose TIFF. Unless file size is a 
concern (because, for example, you need to send an image by e-mail), 
always export a TIFF if you need a raster image. For everything from 
working in Photoshop to creating a layout in InDesign or QuarkXPress, a 
TIFF can provide the image quality you need.
 
✓ TIFFs don’t compress your image data. That means they don’t introduce 
any garbage like JPEGs do, but it also means that they’re really big files.
 
✓ Pay attention to your pixel count. If you’re exporting a TIFF, you’re 
probably looking for the best image quality you can get. And if that’s 
the case, you need to make sure that your TIFF is “big” enough — that it 
includes enough pixels — to display at the size you need. Have a look at 
the next section in this chapter for more information.
JPEG (or JPG)
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which makes it sound 
much fancier than it really is. Almost every digital image you’ve ever seen 
was a JPEG (pronounced JAY-peg); it’s the standard file format for images on 
the Web. Check out these JPEG details:
 
✓ When file size is a concern, choose JPEG. The whole point of the JPEG 
file format is to compress raster images to manageable file sizes so that 
they can be e-mailed and put on web sites. A JPEG is a fraction of the 
size of a TIFF file with the same number of pixels, so JPEG is a great 
choice if file size is more important to you than image quality.
 
✓ JPEGs compress file size by degrading image quality. This is known as 
lossy compression; JPEG technology basically works by tossing out a lot 
of the pixels in your image. JPEGs also introduce a fair amount of pixel 
garbage; these smudges are called artifacts, and they’re awful.

355
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
 
✓ JPEG + SketchUp = Danger. Because of the way the JPEG file format 
works, JPEG exports from SketchUp are particularly susceptible to look-
ing terrible. Images from SketchUp usually include straight lines and 
broad areas of color, both of which JPEG has a hard time handling. If 
you’re going to export a JPEG from SketchUp, make sure that the JPEG 
Compression slider is never set below 8. For more details, see the sec-
tion “Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter.
Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
 
Hooray for PNG! Pronounced ping, this graphics file format is my hero. 
Unfortunately, it isn’t as widely used as it should be. If I had my druthers (I 
keep leaving them on the subway), every raster export from SketchUp would 
be a PNG. Why? Because, at least as far as SketchUp is concerned, PNG com-
bines all the best features of TIFF and JPEG. Why don’t more people use PNGs? 
Because standards are hard to change, and right now, it’s a JPEG world. PNG 
details are as follows:
 
✓ PNGs compress image data without affecting image quality. As a loss-
less compression technology, PNGs are smaller files than TIFFs (just 
like JPEGs), but they don’t mess up any pixels (totally unlike JPEGs). 
Granted, PNGs aren’t as small as JPEGs, but I think the difference in 
image quality is worth a few extra bits.
 
✓ If you’re exporting an image for someone who knows a thing or two 
about computers, choose PNG. The truth is, some software doesn’t 
know what to do with a PNG, so there’s a risk in using it. If you plan to 
send your exported image to someone who knows what he’s doing, go 
ahead and send a PNG — he’ll be impressed that you’re “in the know.” If 
the recipient of your export is less technologically sophisticated, stick 
with a JPEG or TIFF file; it’s the safe choice.
Understanding rasters: Lots and lots of dots
When you look at a photograph on your com-
puter, you’re really looking at a whole bunch 
of tiny dots of color called pixels. These are 
arranged in a rectangular grid called a raster. 
Digital images that are composed of pixels 
arranged in a raster grid are called raster 
images, or rasters for short. Have a look at the 
first image in the figure below for a close-up 
view of a raster image. Here are some things to 
keep in mind about rasters:
 ✓ Rasters are everywhere. Almost every 
digital image you’ve ever seen is a raster. 
TIFF, JPEG, and PNG are three of the most 
common raster file formats, and SketchUp 
exports all of them.
 ✓ Rasters are flexible. Every two-dimensional 
image can be displayed as a raster; a grid 
of colored squares is an incredibly effective 
way of saving and sharing picture informa-
tion. As long as you have enough pixels, any 
image can look good as a raster.

356
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
The PNG file format wasn’t developed to replace JPEG or TIFF; it was sup-
posed to stand in for GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), which is a file type 
that SketchUp doesn’t export. Without going into too much detail, folks use 
JPEG for images like photographs and GIF for things like logos. Because 
exported SketchUp views usually have more in common with the latter, PNG 
(the replacement for GIF) is the better choice. So why can’t PNG replace JPEG 
and TIFF? For most photographs (which are the majority of images on the 
Web), JPEG is better than PNG because it produces smaller files, which in turn 
yields faster load times when you’re surfing the Internet. TIFF is more versatile 
Individual pixels
800 pixels
600 pixels
 ✓ Rasters take up a lot of space. If you think 
about how raster images work, it takes a lot 
of information to describe a picture. Digital 
images are made up of anywhere from 
thousands to millions of pixels, and each 
pixel can be any one of millions of colors. 
To store a whole picture, a raster image file 
needs to include the location and color of 
each pixel; the bigger the picture, the more 
pixels it takes to describe it, and the bigger 
the file size gets.
 ✓ Rasters are measured in pixels. Because 
every raster image is made up of a specific 
number of pixels, you use a raster’s pixel 
dimensions to describe its size. If I told you 
that I’d e-mailed you a photograph that was 
800 x 600, you could expect to receive a pic-
ture that is 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall. 
(See the following figure.) Pixels don’t have a 
physical size on their own — they’re just dots 
of color. You determine a picture’s physical 
size by deciding how big its pixels should be; 
this is referred to as resolution, and is gen-
erally expressed in terms of pixels per inch 
(ppi). Check out the section “Making sure 
that you’re exporting enough pixels,” later in 
this chapter, for the whole scoop.
Why use pixels instead of inches or centimeters 
to describe the size of a digital image? It all has 
to do with how computer screens work. Because 
not all screens display things at the same size, 
it’s impossible to predict how big an image will 
look when it shows up on someone’s computer. 
Depending on the person’s display settings, an 
800-x-600-pixel image might be a few inches 
across, or it might take up the whole screen. 
Giving a digital image’s dimensions in pixels is the 
only accurate way of describing how “big” it is.

357
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
than PNG because it supports different color spaces, which are important to 
people in the printing industry. For reasons that are beyond the scope of this 
book, that isn’t relevant to exports from SketchUp; PNG is still (in my opinion) 
the best — if not the safest — choice.
Windows Bitmap (BMP)
Windows Bitmap, or BMP, files are old school; they can only be used on 
Windows, and they’re big. If a BMP were a car, it would be the old, rusty van 
in your parents’ garage. As you can probably guess, I don’t recommend using 
BMPs for anything, with a couple of exceptions:
 
✓ To send your exported file to someone with a very old Windows com-
puter: If the person to whom you’re sending an exported image has a 
Windows computer that’s more than about five years old, I suppose I’d 
send him a BMP.
 
✓ To place an image in an old Windows version of layout software: If 
your layout person is using a copy of Word or PageMaker that’s a few 
years old, he might need a BMP file.
Making sure that you’re exporting 
enough pixels
When it comes to raster images, it’s all about pixels. The more pixels your 
image has, the more detailed it is, and the bigger it can be displayed or 
printed. Figure 13-4 shows the same image three times. The first image is 150 
x 50, meaning that it’s 150 pixels wide by 50 pixels high. The second image is 
300 x 100, and the third is 900 x 300. Notice how the image with more pixels 
looks a lot better? That’s the whole point of this section.

358
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
Why not always export a truckload of pixels, just in case you need them? 
There are two reasons:
 
✓ Image exports with lots of pixels take a long time to process.
 
✓ Raster images are very big files.
How many pixels you need to export depends on what you’re going to use 
the image for. Very broadly, you can do two things with your image:
 
✓ Display or project it on a screen, digitally
 
✓ Print it
In the next two sections, I talk about each of these possibilities in detail.
Exporting enough pixels for a digital presentation
If you plan to use your exported image as part of an on-screen presentation, it’s 
helpful to know what computer monitors and digital projectors can display:
 
✓ The smallest, oldest devices currently in use have images that are 800 
pixels wide by 600 pixels high.
 
✓ At the other end of the spectrum, high-end, 30-inch LCD monitors dis-
play 2560 x 1600 pixels.
So it stands to reason that if you’re exporting an image that will be viewed 
on-screen only, you need to create an image that’s somewhere between 800 
and 2500 pixels wide. Table 13-1 provides some guidelines on image sizes for 
different digital applications.
Table 13-1 
Suggested Image Sizes for On-Screen Use
How the Image Will Be Used
Image Width (pixels)
E-mail

Web site, large image
600
Web site, small image
200

800 or 1024 (depends on projector)
PowerPoint presentation (floating image)
400
 
For images that will be shown digitally, leave the Resolution setting (in the 
Export Options dialog box) at 72 pixels per inch. For computer monitors and 
digital projectors, the image resolution is meaningless because the pixels in 
your image correspond directly to the pixels on your screen; inches and centi-
meters don’t even come into play.

359
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
Understanding resolution: Exporting images for print
 
Images that you want to print need to have lots more pixels than ones that are 
only going to be displayed on-screen. That’s because printers — inkjet, laser, 
and offset — all operate very differently than computer monitors and digital 
projectors. When you print something, the pixels in your image turn into 
microscopic specks of ink or toner, and these specks are smaller than the 
pixels on your computer screen. To make a decent-sized print of your 
exported image, it needs to contain enough pixels per inch of image. An 
image’s pixel density, expressed in pixels per inch (ppi), is its resolution.
What kind of resolution you need depends on three things:
 
✓ The kind of device you’ll be printing to: For home inkjet printers, you 
can get away with a resolution of as little as 150 ppi. If your image will be 
appearing in a commercially produced book, you need a resolution of at 
least 300 ppi.
 
✓ How far away the image will be from the audience: There’s a big dif-
ference between a magazine page and a trade-show banner. For close-up 
applications, a resolution of 200 to 300 ppi is appropriate. Large graph-
ics that will be viewed from several feet away can be as low as 60 ppi.
 
✓ The subject matter of the image itself: Photographic images tend to 
consist of areas of color that blur together a bit; these kinds of images 
can tolerate being printed at lower resolutions than drawings with lots of 
intricate detail. For images with lots of lines (like SketchUp models), it’s 
best to work with very high resolutions — 300 to 600 ppi — especially if 
the image will be viewed close-up.
Table 13-2 provides some guidelines for exporting images that will be printed.

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
Keep in mind that the biggest raster image that SketchUp can export is 10,000 
pixels wide or tall (whichever is greater). This means that the largest banner 
image, printed at 100 ppi, that SketchUp can create is about 100 inches wide. 
To make larger images, you need to export a vector file; check out the details 
on exporting to vector formats with SketchUp Pro in Bonus Chapter 1, online.
Follow these steps to make sure that you’re exporting enough pixels to be 
able to print your image properly:
 
1. In the Export Options dialog box, make sure that the Use View Size 
check box is deselected.
 
 To get to the Export Options dialog box, follow Steps 1 through 6 in the 
section “Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Decide on the resolution that you need for your exported image. 
(Refer to Table 13-2.)
 
 Keep the resolution in your head or scribble it on a piece of paper.
 
3. Decide how big your exported image will be printed, in inches or 
“centimeters.
 
 Note your desired physical image size, just like you did with the resolu-
tion in the previous step.
 
4. Multiply your resolution from Step 2 by your image size from Step 3 to 
get the number of pixels you need to export:
 
 Resolution (pixels/in or cm) × Size (in or cm) = Number of pixels
 
 In other words, if you know what resolution you need to export, and 
you know how big your image will be printed, you can multiply the two 
numbers to get the number of pixels you need. Here’s an example: 300 
pixels/inch × 8 inches wide = 2,400 pixels wide.
 
 To export an image that can be printed 8 inches wide at 300 ppi, you 
need to export an image that’s 2,400 pixels wide. Figure 13-5 gives an 
illustration of this example.
 
 SketchUp’s default setting is to make your exported image match the pro-
portions of your modeling window; that is, you can only type in a width 
or a height, but not both. If you’re on a Mac, you can manually enter both 
dimensions by clicking the Unlink (which looks like a chain). You can 
always click it again to relink the width and height dimensions later.
 
5. Type in the width or height of the image you’d like to export, in pixels.
 
 It’s usually pretty hard to know exactly how big your image will be 
when it’s printed, and even if you do, you probably want to leave some 
room for cropping. For these reasons, I always add 15–25 percent to 
the number of pixels I figure I’ll need. If my image calls for 2,400 pixels, I 
export 3,000 pixels, just to be safe.

361
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
 
 If you’re on a Mac, things are a little easier because SketchUp’s design-
ers built a pixel calculator right into the Export Options dialog box. Just 
enter your desired resolution in the appropriate spot, change the width 
and height units from pixels to inches or centimeters, and type in your 
desired image size. SketchUp does the arithmetic for you.
 
6. Click the OK button to close the Export Options dialog box.

Making Movies with Animation Export
When it comes to having nerdy fun, I think exporting movie animations of 
your SketchUp models is right up there with iPods and store-bought fire-
works. Like both of these things, what’s so great about animation export is 
how easy it is to do. That’s not to say that animation and digital video are 
simple topics — they’re not. It would take a freight elevator to move the 
books that have been written about working with video on the computer, but 
I’m going to keep it simple. Because you and I are primarily interested in 3D 
modeling, what you find in the following sections are instructions for doing 
what you need to do.

362
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Getting ready for prime time
The key to exporting animations of your SketchUp models is using scenes; if 
you haven’t read it already, now’s the time to check out Chapter 10. Scenes 
are saved views of your model that you can arrange in any order you want. 
When you export an animation, SketchUp strings together the scenes in your 
model to create a movie file that can be played on just about any computer 
made in the last several years.
Follow these steps to get your model ready to export as an animation:
 
1. Create scenes to build the “skeleton” of your animation.
 
2. To adjust the animation settings in the Model Info dialog box, choose 
Window➪Model Info and then select the Animation panel.
 
 I explain all the controls in the section about moving from scene to 
scene in Chapter 10.
 
3. Click the Enable Scene Transitions check box to tell SketchUp to move 
smoothly from one scene to the next.
 
4. Enter a transition time to tell SketchUp how long to spend moving 
between scenes.
 
 If your Scene Delay is 0 (below), you can multiply your transition time 
by your number of scenes to figure out how long your exported anima-
tion will be.
 
5. Enter a scene delay time to pause at each scene before moving on to 
the next one.
 
 If you plan to talk about each scene, use the scene delay time to pause 
before each one. If your animation is supposed to be a smooth walk-
through or flyover, set this to 0.
 
6. Adjust the proportions of your modeling window to approximate the 
proportions of your movie.
 
 Unlike SketchUp’s 2D export formats, the proportions of your exported 
movie don’t depend on those of your modeling window; that is to say, 
making your modeling window long and skinny won’t result in a long and 
skinny movie. You choose how many pixels wide and tall you want your 
movie to be, so to get an idea of how much you’ll be able to see, make 
your modeling window match the proportions of your exported file 
(4:3 is common for video formats). Have a look at Step 1 in the section 
“Exporting a raster image from SketchUp,” earlier in this chapter, for 
guidance on adjusting your modeling window.
 
7. When your project is ready to go, move on to the next section to 
export your animation.

363
 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
Exporting a movie
Fortunately, you have only one choice if you want to export a movie from 
SketchUp. If you’re using Windows, you create an AVI file; Mac users create 
QuickTime MOVs.
 
If you’re paying close attention to the available file formats for exporting 
movies, you’ll probably notice three more choices in the drop-down menu: 
TIF, JPG, and PNG. I don’t go into detail about these formats for animation 
(movie) export in SketchUp because you probably won’t need them; choos-
ing to export in any of these formats will give you a pile of image files that 
each represent one frame in your animation. People who want to include their 
SketchUp animation in a Flash file should take advantage of this option, but 
explaining how to do so is beyond the scope of this book.
While exporting animations in SketchUp is a pretty simple operation, figur-
ing out how to set all the animation export controls can seem like landing 
the space shuttle. What follows are step-by-step instructions for generating a 
movie file; settings recommendations are in the next section.
Follow these steps to export a movie file from SketchUp:
 
1. Prepare your model for export as an animation.
 
 See the section “Getting ready for prime time,” earlier in this chapter, for 
a list of things you need to do before you export an animation.
 
2. Choose File➪Export➪Animation.
 
 This opens the Animation Export dialog box.
 
3. Give your movie file a name, and choose where it should be saved on 
your computer system.
 
4. Make sure that the correct file format is selected.
 
 In the Format drop-down menu, choose AVI if you’re using Windows and 
QuickTime if you’re on a Mac.
 
5. Click the Options button to open the Animation Export Options dialog 
box. (See Figure 13-6.)
 
6. Adjust the settings for the type of animation you want to export.
 
 How you set everything up in this dialog box depends on how you plan 
to use the animation you end up creating. Check out the next section in 
this chapter for recommended settings for different applications.
 
 If you’re working on a Mac, there’s an extra drop-down menu that you 
might find helpful: Format includes a short list of uses for your anima-
tion. Choosing one automatically sets most of the controls for you, 
though (as you see in the next section) you can improve things a bit by 
making some of your own selections.

dialog box.
 
 
7. Select the Anti-alias check box, if it isn’t already selected.
 
 Choosing this doubles the amount of time it takes for your animation to 
export, but it makes your edges look much better in the final movie.
 
8. Click the Codec button (Windows) or the Expert button (Mac).
 
 This opens the Video Compression (Compression Settings on a Mac) 
dialog box. (See Figure 13-7.) Choose the correct settings for the type of 
animation you want to export, again referring to the next section of this 
chapter for details about what the options mean.
 
9. Click the OK button in the compression dialog box, and click the OK 
button again in the Export Options dialog box.
 
 This returns you to the Animation Export dialog box.
 
10. Check to make sure that everything looks right, and then click the 
Export button.
 
 Because exporting an animation takes a while, it pays to double-check 
your settings before you click the Export button. When the export is 
complete, you can find your animation file in the location you specified 
in Step 3. Double-clicking it should cause it to open in whatever movie-
playing software you have that can read it. On Windows computers, this 
is usually Windows Media Player; on Macs, it’s QuickTime.
Figuring out the Animation Export 
options settings
As I said before, digital video is complicated. Lucky for us, you don’t really 
have to know what everything means to export the right kind of movie; you 
just have to know how to set up everything.

What follows are a number of different things you might want to do with your 
animation, and recommended settings for getting good results. Feel free to 
experiment, but the following sections are a good place to start.
For sending in an e-mail
If you’re going to e-mail someone an animation file, you have to make the file 
as small as you can. These settings can help you do just that:

For uploading to YouTube
YouTube (www.youtube.com) is a video-sharing site that can host your ani-
mations for free. Once it’s on YouTube, you can link to your video and even 
embed it on your own web pages. You need to keep two things in mind when 
you’re creating a video for YouTube: Videos need to be under 1GB in file size, 
and they need to be under ten minutes in length. These settings will yield a 
“YouTubeable” video: 
Width and Height 
640 x 480
Frame Rate 
30 fps
Codec (Windows) 
Indeo Video 5.10
Compression Type (Mac) 
H.264
Key Frame Every 
24 frames
Compression Quality (Windows) 
50
Quality (Mac) 
Medium
For viewing on-screen (computer or projector)
If you plan to use your animation as part of an on-screen presentation (such 
as with PowerPoint or Keynote), you probably want it to look good full-
screen. You’ll probably be using a digital projector to present, and these 
days, most digital projectors come in two resolutions: 800 x 600 and 1024 x 
768. If you know the resolution of the projector you’ll be using, you’re made 
in the shade. If you’re unsure, export at the lower pixel count, just to be safe:
Width and Height 
800 x 600 or 1024 x 768
Frame Rate 
15 fps
Codec (Windows) 
Indeo Video 5.10
Compression Type (Mac) 
H.264
Key Frame Every 
24 frames
Compression Quality (Windows) 
100
Quality (Mac)

You want your exported animations to look smooth — the transitions from 
one frame to the next shouldn’t be jumpy or awkward. If your camera is cover-
ing a lot of ground (in other words, moving a large distance between scenes) 
in a very short time, you might want to experiment with increasing your frame 
rate to smooth things out. Doing so adds more frames between transitions, 
which means the camera isn’t traveling as far between frames.

 Chapter 13: Exporting Images and Animations
For exporting to DV (for viewing on a TV with a DVD player)
If you need to export an animation that will be burned onto a DVD that will 
(in turn) be played in a DVD player, you should go all-in on quality and file 
size. The export process will take a long time, but you’ll get the best-looking 
movie you can get. Try these settings first:

Creating Presentation Documents 
with LayOut
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out what LayOut is for
▶ Figuring out where everything is (and what it does)
▶ Looking at what makes LayOut unique
▶ Building a simple presentation document from scratch
▶ Printing and exporting your work
P
eople who design things in 3D have to present their ideas to other people, 
and most of the time they have to present in a 2D format. Creating these 
presentations almost always involves the use of layout or illustration soft-
ware like InDesign, Illustrator, or QuarkXPress; these programs are great, but 
they can be expensive and tricky to get the hang of, especially if you’re not a 
graphic designer.
If you’re lucky enough to have the Pro version of Google SketchUp 7, you 
have access to a whole separate piece of software called Google SketchUp 
LayOut, or LayOut for short.
LayOut is a program that lets you create documents for presenting your 3D 
SketchUp models, both on paper and on-screen. LayOut was designed to be 
easy to use, quick to learn, and tightly integrated with SketchUp. The people 
who built it want you to use LayOut to create all your design presentations; 
here are some examples of what you can make:
 
✓ Information sheets
 
✓ Storyboards
 
✓ Design packs
 
✓ Presentation boards and posters
 
✓ Vector illustrations and diagrams
 
✓ On-screen, PowerPoint-style slide shows

370
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
LayOut gives you the tools to create cover pages, title blocks, callouts, and 
symbols — whatever you need to accompany views of your model. You 
can create presentations that are just about any physical size, and you can 
export them as PDF files or images to send to other people. Best of all, when 
your design changes in SketchUp, you can easily update your model views in 
LayOut to reflect the changes. If you make your living designing and present-
ing ideas in 3D, LayOut can save you boatloads of time.
In this chapter, I give a pretty high-level overview of what you can do with 
LayOut — there’s a lot of information to convey, after all. I start out with a 
couple of pages about the different things you can use LayOut to accomplish. 
I follow that up with a quick tour of the LayOut user interface, explaining 
where everything is and what it’s supposed to do. Next, I take you through 
the process of creating a simple presentation drawing set from one of your 
SketchUp models — not exhaustively by any means, but it should be enough 
to see you through a tight deadline.
Getting Your Bearings
Even though LayOut comes with SketchUp Pro, it’s not just a SketchUp 
feature — LayOut is a full-fledged, gets-its-own-icon program. As such, 
LayOut has its own menus, tools, dialog boxes, and Drawing Window. A 
couple of versions from now, LayOut will probably have its own For Dummies 
book. (Maybe I’ll even get to write it!)
Even though LayOut’s user interface is pretty standard, I want to give you 
a quick overview of the different elements. Knowing that it’s a lot like other 
software you’ve used (including SketchUp) should help you come up to 
speed quickly. Figure 14-1 shows the LayOut user interface. The following 
sections explain the various parts in more detail.
Some menu bar minutiae
Just like almost every other piece of software in the universe, LayOut has a 
menu bar. And just like SketchUp, you can use LayOut’s menu bar to access 
the vast majority of its tools, commands, settings, and dialog boxes. Here’s a 
brief description of each of LayOut’s nine menus:
 
✓ File: No big surprises here — you use the items in the File menu to 
create new LayOut files, save and adjust settings for the document 
you’re working on, export PDFs and images, and insert SketchUp and 
other graphics files.

371
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ Edit: You use the items in the Edit menu to copy and paste, work with clip-
ping masks (LayOut’s version of cropping), and control object grouping.
 
 In the Windows version of LayOut, the Edit menu includes Preferences, 
which is where you can do some things to customize LayOut.
 
✓ View: Besides standard stuff like controls for zooming, the most inter-
esting item here is Start Presentation, which lets you view your LayOut 
as a PowerPoint-style slide presentation.
 
✓ Text: Fifty bonus points if you can figure out what the items in the Text 
menu are for — there’s nothing out of the ordinary here.
 
✓ Arrange: Because LayOut documents are basically well-organized col-
lections of images, inserted SketchUp models, text, and callouts, you 
need to be able to control everything’s place on the page. In the Arrange 
menu, you find commands for controlling the horizontal, vertical, and 
stacking-order position of every element in your document, as well as 
controls for telling LayOut what snap settings to use.
 
 Stacking order refers to the fact that all elements on the same layer in 
your document are either in front of or behind other elements. When 
one thing is overlapping another, their stacking order determines which 
one you see and which one is hidden.
 
 Snap settings help you position elements on your page by making it 
easier to line things up with a grid or with other elements. Depending 
on what you’re trying to do, you might choose to work with both kinds 
of snap settings, just one, or none at all; I usually switch between them 
while I’m working.
 
✓ Tools: Here’s where you find all of LayOut’s tools (big surprise); there 
are a lot more of them than you think. Luckily, most are pretty special-
ized, so you don’t need to know them all before you get started.
 
✓ Pages: Given the complexity of most of the software we all have to use, 
it’s almost adorable how few items live in the Pages menu. Your LayOut 
presentation can have many pages, and here’s where you add, delete, 
duplicate, and move among them.
 
✓ Window: In the Window menu, you find links to all of LayOut’s dialog 
boxes; take a look at the next section in this chapter for a rundown on 
all of them.
 
✓ Help: Just like in SketchUp, the Help menu should be the first place you 
go when you’re stuck.
 
✓ LayOut (Mac only): The Mac version of LayOut includes a LayOut menu, 
which is standard operating procedure for Mac applications. The impor-
tant thing in this menu is Preferences, which lets you set up the program 
the way you want it.

In both the Windows and Mac versions of LayOut, you can have more than 
one document open at a time. On the Mac, separate files look just like they do 
for other programs — they’re all in different windows. LayOut on Windows is 
a little different, though: Your open files are displayed as tabs across the top 
of your Drawing Window, a little bit like scenes are in SketchUp. This con-
fuses some people who think that the tabs represent pages. Now you know; 
they don’t.
A dialog box discourse
You can find most of LayOut’s knobs and switches in its eight dialog boxes. 
In Windows, most of LayOut’s dialog boxes are contained in a “tray” that 
appears on the right side of your screen by default. On the Mac, your dialog 
boxes float around willy-nilly, but you can snap them together if you want.

373
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
Here’s a one-minute description of each:
 
✓ Colors: Just about all your LayOut documents will use color in some 
way, so you’ll need this dialog box most of the time. The nice thing 
about Color is that it appears when you need it; clicking any color well 
in LayOut pops it open (if it wasn’t already open).
 
 To hide a dialog box without closing it, click its title bar once to mini-
mize it. Click again to see the whole thing.
 
✓ Shape Style: A lot of the graphic elements in your presentation can have 
color fills and strokes (outlines). The Shape Style dialog box is where 
you control the appearance of those fills and strokes. Check out the 
options in the Start and End drop-down menus — you won’t find callout 
styles like these in most other layout programs.
 
✓ SketchUp Model: The greatest thing about LayOut (at least with respect 
to other software like it) is its ability to include 2D views of your 
SketchUp models. In the SketchUp Model dialog box, you can control all 
sorts of things about the way your placed SketchUp model looks, includ-
ing camera views, scenes, styles, shadows, scale, and fog. For folks 
who spend a lot of time laying out presentation drawings that include 
SketchUp models, the SketchUp Model dialog box is a godsend. In fact, 
it’s so important that I gave it a whole section in this chapter.
 
✓ Text Style: If you’ve ever used another piece of page layout or illustra-
tion software, you should be pretty familiar with what the Text Style 
dialog box lets you do. You use it to control the font, size, style, color, 
and alignment of text in your document.
 
✓ Pages: You use the Pages dialog box to manage the pages in your docu-
ment. You can add, delete, duplicate, and rearrange them to your heart’s 
content. The List and Icon buttons at the top let you toggle between 
views of your pages; I prefer to use the former and give my pages mean-
ingful names as I work. The little icons on the right control visibility for 
full-screen presentations.
 
✓ Layers: You can have multiple layers of content in every LayOut docu-
ment you create.
 
 Use the Layers dialog box to add, delete, and rearrange layers in your 
document. The icons on the right let you hide (and show), lock, and 
share individual layers.
 
 Shared layers are somewhat unique to LayOut; they let you automatically 
place elements on more than one page. For more detail, see the section 
“Simplifying Layout with Layers” later in this chapter.

374
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
✓ Scrapbooks: This one’s a little trickier to explain; scrapbooks are unique 
to LayOut, so you probably haven’t worked with anything like them 
before. Scrapbooks are LayOut files that live in a special folder on your 
computer system. They contain colors, text styles, and graphic elements 
(like scale cars, trees, and people) that you might need to use in more 
than one of your LayOut documents. To use something you see in a 
scrapbook, just click it with the Select tool, and then click again in your 
Drawing Window to stamp it in. You can also sample things like colors, 
line weights, and text styles by clicking with any other tool.
 
✓ Instructor: The Instructor dialog box works just like it does in SketchUp; 
it shows information on whichever tool you happen to be using. If you’re 
just starting out with LayOut, make sure that this dialog box is open.
Setting up LayOut preferences
In LayOut, as in SketchUp, you have two kinds of preferences to worry about: 
those that apply to every LayOut document you work on and those that only 
apply to the document you happen to be working on at the moment. Settings 
for the former are made in the Preferences dialog box; controls for the latter 
reside in Document Setup. The following sections describe what I mean.
Preferences
The LayOut Preferences dialog box is made up of eight panels. You open it by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences in Windows or LayOut➪Preferences on the Mac. 
Here’s what you’ll find on each panel:
 
✓ Applications: Tell LayOut what programs you want to use to edit image 
and text files when you right-click them (in LayOut) and choose Open 
with Image (or Text) Editor from the context menu.
 
✓ Backup: Work smart by letting LayOut auto-save and create automatic 
backups of your file. Here’s where you tell it how often to do so.
 
✓ Folders: Let LayOut know where to look for the templates and scrap-
books on your computer. Templates show up when you start LayOut or 
open a new document; scrapbooks appear in the Scrapbook dialog box.
 
✓ General: The Auto Render check box in this panel is handy if you’re 
working with big SketchUp models that take a long time for LayOut 
to process while you’re working. Deselect it to speed things up while 
you’re roughing things out.
 
✓ Presentation: Decide where to display your full-screen presentation 
when you’re in Presentation Mode.

375
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ Scales: You can choose from this list of scales for a SketchUp model 
view you’ve placed in your LayOut document. If you want to use a 
certain drawing scale and it doesn’t show up in the Scales pane of the 
SketchUp Model dialog box, feel free to add it here. This is not the draw-
ing scale for the document you’re currently working on, so don’t worry 
about that.
 
✓ Shortcuts: Just like SketchUp, you use this panel to define a keyboard 
shortcut for any tool or command in LayOut.
 
✓ Startup: In this panel, tell LayOut how to behave every time you launch 
it (or just start a new file).
Document Setup
The Document Setup dialog box includes five panels. You open it by choosing 
File➪Document Setup in the menu bar. Here’s the skinny on each panel:
 
✓ General: Feel free to enter information about yourself and your docu-
ment; this might be important if you’re working on a team.
 
✓ Grid: Nothing beats a grid for helping to line up elements in your pre-
sentations. Use the options in this panel to control the visibility and size 
of the grid in your document, if you want one. For Major Grid, type in an 
interval for the darker grid lines. For Minor Grid, enter the number of 
divisions between dark lines you’d like to have. For 1/4-inch squares, you 
would enter 1 inch for the former and 4 for the latter.
 
✓ Paper: Here’s where you tell LayOut the size and color of the sheet of 
paper you’d like to use for your document. The Rendering Resolution 
part of this panel is new for SketchUp 7, and it’s great. If you’re work-
ing with inserted SketchUp models of any complexity, set “Edit Quality” 
to Low until you’re ready to preview your document. Only set “Output 
Quality” to High if you need to print or export documents that are small 
enough to pass around at a meeting.
 
✓ References: When you insert a SketchUp model or an image in your 
LayOut document, LayOut creates a file reference that keeps track of 
where it came from.
 
 If you edit the original file (which you probably will), this panel lets you 
know whether LayOut is showing the most currently saved version. For 
people who go back and forth between design and presentation docu-
ments a lot (sound familiar?), the References panel is a gift from the 
heavens.
 
✓ Units: Depending on where you live and work, you might use a different 
system of measurement. Use the Units panel to pick the right one for 
your workflow.

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Tooling around
LayOut has lots of tools, but as with most software, you spend most of your 
time with only a handful of them. You can find the complete list in the Tools 
menu, but it’s easier to get at them on the toolbar. This strip, across the top 
of your Drawing Window, includes icons for the most commonly used tools 
(and commands), but you can easily add others if you want to. Here’s a bullet 
point on each of the tools in the LayOut toolbar’s default set. See Figure 14-2, 
which shows the toolbar for the Windows version of LayOut.
 
✓ Select: Select, rotate, move, copy, and scale elements in your document. 
Double-click to edit text and SketchUp model views.
 
✓ Line: Draw a straight line by clicking to define start points and end-
points. Draw a curved line by clicking and dragging to define your line’s 
curvature. Press Esc to stop drawing a line. 
Switching to LayOut from similar software
If you’re used to using other page-layout or 
illustration software, some things about LayOut 
are useful to know when you’re just getting 
started. The folks who designed LayOut did 
things a little differently on purpose, hoping to 
do for page layout in 2007 what they did for 3D 
design seven years earlier — make it easier for 
motivated people with no experience to pro-
duce good work, quickly.
Here, I point out the five things you should keep 
in mind when you’re exploring LayOut:
 ✓ LayOut includes templates that help you get 
up and running in no time. See the nearby 
section “Starting out with templates” for 
details.
 ✓ You can insert models from SketchUp, skip-
ping the process of exporting your model 
as an image file. Importing has the added 
benefit of helping you automatically update 
model views in your presentation. See the 
section “Bringing in Everything You Need,” 
later in this chapter, for details.
 ✓ The Layers feature in LayOut is a powerful 
tool for organizing your content. In particu-
lar, you can place content that appears on 
more than one of your pages on a shared 
layer, so you only have to position it once. 
The section “Simplifying Layout with 
Layers” later in this chapter outlines just 
what you need to know.
 ✓ In LayOut, you have enormous flexibility to 
crop images, including model views, with 
ease using clipping masks. The section 
“Cropping with clipping masks,” later in this 
chapter, explains how in four easy steps.
 ✓ When your presentation is ready to go, 
LayOut enables you to set up digital slide 
shows in full-screen mode, as well as to 
create printouts and PDF files.

 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ Arc: Draw an arc by clicking once to define the arc’s center point, again 
to start the arc (which defines its radius), and a third time to end the arc.
 
✓ Rectangle: Draw a rectangle by clicking to define opposite corners. If 
you’re drawing a rectangle with rounded corners or sides, you can use 
the up- and down-arrow keys to adjust the amount of rounding.
 
✓ Circle: Draw a circle by clicking once to define a center and again to 
define a radius.
 
✓ Polygon: Draw polygons by first entering a side count and then using 
your mouse. Select the Polygon tool, type the number of sides followed by 
the letter s (8s for an octagon), and then press Enter. Now click once with 
your mouse to define a center point and again to draw the shape. Whew.
 
✓ Text: Draw an empty text box into which you can enter text. If you need 
to edit text you’ve already typed, double-click it with the Select tool or 
the Text tool.
 
 Here’s a neat shortcut: You can tell a text box about the alignment of the 
text it will contain by changing the way you draw it. Draw your text box 
from left-to-right to specify left-justified text or right-to-left for right-justi-
fied. Even handier, hold down Control (Option on a Mac) to draw a text 
box with text that is centered both horizontally and vertically.
 
✓ Label: Draw a text label with a leader line by clicking to define the end of 
the line (where it’s pointing), clicking again to define the beginning, and 
then typing in some text.
 
✓ Erase: Click or drag over any unlocked elements to erase them.
 
✓ Style: Click any element to sample (soak up) its fill, stroke, and other 
attributes. Doing so turns the tool into the Bucket, which you use to apply 
those attributes to other elements in your document by clicking them.
 
✓ Split: Cut one line segment (whether curved or straight) into two by 
clicking where you want the split to occur. Turning Object Snap on (in 
the Arrange menu) is very helpful for splitting shapes at their corners.
 
✓ Join: Turn two line segments (curved or straight) into a single one by 
clicking each in turn. Both are highlighted blue when they’re joined.
 
✓ Start Presentation: Enter full-screen Presentation Mode.
 
✓ Add Page: Add a page after the one you’re on.
 
✓ Previous Page: View the previous page in your document.
 
✓ Next Page: View the next page in your document.
 
Adding more tool icons to your toolbar is easy; just right-click the toolbar and 
choose Customize to bring up the Customize dialog box. Now drag tool icons 
up into your toolbar. If you’re on Windows, you have to select the Command 
tab first.

Getting Set Up
Every time you launch LayOut, and every time you choose File➪New, a dialog 
box asks how you want to start out. (See Figure 14-3.) If you don’t see the dialog 
box, you can switch it on in the Startup panel of the Preferences dialog box.
The theory is that when you open most programs, you usually want to do one 
of two things:
 
✓ Start a new document: The New tab at the top of the dialog box 
presents you with a list of templates that come preloaded in LayOut. 
There’s nothing special about these templates — they’re just ready-
made LayOut files you can use as a starting point for your presentation. 
Expand the items in the list on the left to see the available templates by 
category.
Watch those defaults
All of LayOut’s drawing and text tools come “out 
of the box” with a default setting, depending on 
the template you’re using. For example, the Line 
tool might be set to create a single-pixel black 
line with a white shape fill. The Text tool might 
be configured to create 10-point Verdana. Tools 
automatically use the settings that were applied 
the last time they were used.
It’s easy enough to change the default settings 
for your tools. Just follow these steps:
 1. Click the tool icon you want to use.
 2. In the Shape Style or Text dialog box, 
choose the settings you want to use.
 3. Draw or type to use the new settings.
Here’s the thing: Changing the default settings 
in one LayOut file doesn’t change them for other 
files. Tool defaults stick to particular docu-
ments. If you want to change the default set-
tings for every new document you create, you 
need to create your own template. Learn about 
how to do that in “Starting out with templates,” 
later in this chapter.

379
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ Open a document you’ve already started: Click the Recent tab at the 
top of the dialog box to show a list of LayOut files you’ve worked on 
most recently. Select one and click the Open (Choose, on a Mac) button 
to open it. To open an existing document that doesn’t appear in the 
Recent list, click the Open an Existing File button to open the Open 
dialog box.
 
Sometimes you see a third tab in your Getting Started dialog box: Recovered. 
If LayOut has crashed on you, or if you ever had any LayOut files that weren’t 
saved when things went awry, the document you were working on should 
show up in the Recovered tab. It’s still a good idea to save often, though.
 
Figure 14-3: 
The Getting 
Started 
dialog box.
 
Starting out with templates
More often than not, you can find a template to use as a starting point for 
your presentation. Browse the list, select one you like, and click the Open 
(Choose, on a Mac) button to begin working with a template. You can also 
create a custom template, as I explain in a moment. In my experience, tem-
plates are the quickest way to get up and running with a new LayOut project.
Here are a few things you should know about templates (while I’m on the 
subject); Figure 14-4 points them out in a screen shot:
 
✓ Pay attention to the layers. Many of the templates that come with 
LayOut have multiple layers, and some of these layers are locked by 
default. They’re locked so that you can’t accidentally move things 
around, but you can always unlock them if you need to. In the Layers 
dialog box, click the lock icon to lock or unlock a layer; knowing you 
need to unlock a layer is especially handy when you want to swap in 
your logo instead of using the generic “TLA” that comes preinstalled.

380
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
✓ Have a look at the pages. Most of the more interesting templates 
include at least two pages; the first one’s a cover page. Don’t forget to 
look at all the pages when you’re working with a template — many of 
them open on the second page.
 
✓ Double-click to edit text. One of the really neat things about LayOut is 
that you can edit text on locked layers. Using the Select tool, just dou-
ble-click any text you want to edit (and in some templates, you’ll want to 
edit all the text), type in new text, and then click once somewhere else 
to finish the edit.
 
✓ Feel free to change colors. LayOut’s templates are designed so that 
you can easily change the overall color scheme. Just unlock all the 
layers, open the Shape Styles dialog box, and go nuts. For more informa-
tion about changing colors, see the section “Drawing something from 
scratch,” later in this chapter.

Most of the design presentations that you (or your firm) put together probably 
look a lot alike — after all, they’re part of your brand identity. If the presenta-
tion documents you make are all variations on a couple of themes, why not 
build your own templates and use them every time you need to start a new 
project? You can set things up so that your templates appear in the Getting 
Started dialog box, making it easier to build consistent presentations, quicker.

381
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
Follow these steps to turn any LayOut file into a template:
 
1. Build a LayOut file that includes all the elements you want.
 
 These elements might include a title block, a logo, a page number, and a 
cover page.
 
 Make sure that you’re viewing the page you want to use as the thumbnail 
preview in the template list, before you move on to Step 2.
 
2. Choose File➪Save as Template.
 
 The Save as Template dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a name for your template.
 
4. Choose a location for your new template.
 
 In the list at the bottom of the dialog box, click the folder (they’re all 
folders) in which you want to include the template you’re adding.
 
5. Click OK. On a Mac, click Save.
 
 The next time the Getting Started dialog box appears, your new template 
will be in it.
Creating a new, blank document
If you decide not to start with one of LayOut’s handy-dandy templates, you’ll 
need to set up a new document from scratch.
Follow these steps to create a fresh, new LayOut document:
 
1. Launch LayOut.
 
 Keep in mind that LayOut and SketchUp are separate software programs, 
so you need to launch them individually. If you’ve already launched 
LayOut, choose File➪New to open the Getting Started dialog box.
 
2. In the Getting Started dialog box, click the New tab.
 
 This shows a list of available templates on the left, with thumbnail pre-
views of each template on the right.
 
3. Click My Templates in the list on the left.
 
4. Select a Plain Paper template on the right, and click Open (Choose, 
on a Mac).
 
 The plain paper templates are completely white.

382
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
 When a new, blank document that you can set up however you like 
appears, you then need to set up your new document the way you want it.
 
5. Choose File➪Document Setup.
 
 This opens the Document Setup dialog box.
 
6. Click Units in the panel list on the left, and select the measurement 
units you prefer to use.
 
 The Units panel lets you choose which units you’d like to use.
 
7. Click Paper in the list on the left, and set your paper size and color.
 
 If you know you’ll be printing on paper that isn’t white, you can simulate 
the color by choosing one here. I don’t recommend trying to print out a 
paper color; most printers don’t print full bleed (right to the edges), so 
the effect really isn’t that great.
 
8. Set up some margins, if you want to.
 
 Margins are useful if you know how close to the edge of your paper you 
can print.
 
9. Set the Edit Quality to Low.
 
 You want to make sure LayOut that doesn’t get bogged down on big 
SketchUp models you insert later on. Read more about working with 
inserted models later in this chapter.
 
10. Set the Output Quality according to your document size.
 
 Basically, the Output Quality you choose depends on the physical size of 
your printed document. As long as your paper size isn’t any bigger than 
11 x 17 inches, you should probably choose High. For bigger presenta-
tions (like boards and posters), use Medium or even Low. The goal is to 
limit the size of the file (in megabytes) that gets sent to your printer — if 
it’s too big, things can get ugly. For more information on image resolu-
tion, have a look at Chapter 13.
 
11. Click Grid in the list of panels on the left, and set up your grid options 
the way you want them.
 
 Now you’re in the Grid panel. For more information about this section of 
the Document Setup dialog box, see the section “Getting Your Bearings,” 
earlier in this chapter.
 
12. Click the Close button to close the Document Setup dialog box.
Adding pages to your document
Follow these steps to add a few blank pages to your document:
 
1. If your Pages dialog box isn’t already open, choose Window➪Pages to 
open it.

383
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
2. Choose Pages➪Add.
 
 This adds a page to your document. You can also add pages by clicking 
the little button that looks like a plus sign (in the upper-left corner of the 
Pages dialog box). Add as many pages as you want.
 
 My favorite way to add a new page is to duplicate an existing one. Just 
click the Duplicate Selected Page button (between Add and Delete) in 
the Pages dialog box.
 
3. In the Pages dialog box, double-click the name of your new page and 
then type in a name for it.
 
4. Press Enter when you’re done. 
 
 Repeat to give all your pages meaningful names.
Moving around your document
You move around on the pages in your document just like you do in 
SketchUp — except in 2D instead of 3D. Here’s how to move around:
 
✓ Panning: Hold down your scroll wheel button while moving your mouse 
around to slide your page around in your Document Window. This is 
called panning.
 
✓ Zooming: Roll your scroll wheel back and forth to zoom in and out on 
your page. To fill your Document Window with the page you’re viewing, 
choose Scale to Fit (Zoom to Fit on the Mac) from the Zoom drop-down 
list in your window’s lower-right corner.
 
✓ Moving from page to page: Click the Next Page and the Previous Page 
buttons on your toolbar to move among the pages in your document. 
You can also click page names in the Pages dialog box, or use the Page 
Up and Page Down button on your keyboard, if you have them.
Simplifying Layout with Layers
You use layers to create multipage documents with elements that are consis-
tent from page to page. You can have two different kinds of layers in LayOut:
 
✓ Unshared: Unshared layers are like layers in every other software 
program. Any element (text, graphic, or otherwise) that you put on an 
unshared layer exists only on one page: the page you’re on when you 
put the element on the layer.
 
✓ Shared: LayOut introduces the notion of shared layers; anything you put 
on a shared layer appears on every page of your document, as long as 
those pages are set up to show that layer.

384
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
It’s all a little confusing at the beginning, so here are a few quick tips about 
how you organize content on layers — including shared layers — as you 
create presentations in LayOut:
 
✓ You can make an element (like a logo) appear in the same spot on 
more than one page by putting it on a shared layer. For example, the 
logo and the project title need to appear in the same spot on every page; 
I put these two elements on the shared layer called “On Every Page.” 
In Figure 14-5, note how the logo and project title appear in exactly the 
same place in the pages labeled B, C, and D.
 
✓ Put content that appears on only one page on an unshared layer. 
Again, in the pages labeled B, C, and D, the image boxes and page titles 
are different on each page, so I put them on the unshared layer called 
“Default.”
 
✓ You can make any layer a shared layer by clicking the Sharing icon to 
the right of its name in the Layers dialog box. (See Figure 14-5.)
 
✓ You decide which pages should show which layers. For example, I 
don’t want the logo and the project title to be on the cover page (labeled 
A in Figure 14-5). I toggle the Show/Hide icon beside the “On Every Page” 
layer to hide it on that page.
 
When you’re manipulating elements on individual layers in LayOut, keep these 
points in mind:
 
✓ To add a new layer, click the plus sign icon in the Layers dialog box.
 
✓ To change which layer something’s on, select the destination layer in 
the Layers dialog box, right-click the element you want to move, and 
choose Move to Current Layer.
 
✓ To see what layer an element is currently on, select the element, then 
look for the tiny blue dot in the Layers dialog box. If you select two ele-
ments on two different layers, you see two blue dots.
 
✓ To lock layers you’re not using, click the Lock icon. I know it’s annoying 
to have to go and unlock a layer before you can modify its contents, but 
it’s even more annoying to accidentally move the wrong things around, 
or even delete them.
 
✓ To hide layers and improve your performance, make liberal use of 
the Hide icon next to the name of each layer; this can really improve 
LayOut’s performance, especially on slower computers. Hide any layers 
you’re not working with, and you’ll notice the difference.
 
I like to work with at least four layers, organizing content on each as follows:
 
✓ Elements that should appear in the same place on almost every page, 
like logos and project titles

385
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ Things that appear in the same place on most pages, but that change 
from page to page, like numbers and page titles
 
✓ Content (like images and SketchUp model views) that only appears on a 
single page
 
✓ Unused stuff that I’m not sure I want, but that I don’t want to delete

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Bringing in Everything You Need
After you have your document set up the way you want it, you probably want 
to start bringing in images. Some programs call this importing, and others call 
it placing. LayOut calls it inserting.
Vive la différence!
You can insert two kinds of images into your LayOut documents:
 
✓ Raster images: This means TIFFs, JPEGs, GIFs, BMPs, and PNGs — these 
are all graphics file formats that save pictures as lots of tiny dots.
 
 The Mac version of LayOut can also insert PDF files, which is indisputably 
the best way to bring in vector art like logos. You can use a program like 
Adobe Illustrator to save any AI (Illustrator) or EPS file as a PDF.
Talking about text
Every file you create will probably have some 
text in it, and LayOut 2 has some really neat (but 
somewhat hidden) features that help a lot. In 
this second version of the software, text boxes 
are classified into two broad types, depending 
on how you create them:
 ✓ Bounded: If you click and drag with the Text 
tool, the text box you create is bounded. 
Any text you enter into it that doesn’t fit 
won’t be visible, and you’ll get a little red 
arrow at the bottom. That arrow tells you 
that there’s more in your text box; you need 
to use the Select tool to make it bigger in 
order to show everything that’s inside. You 
should use a bounded text box whenever 
your text needs to fit into a precise space in 
your design.
 ✓ Unbounded: If, instead of creating a text box 
with the Text tool, you simply click to place 
your cursor somewhere on your page, the 
text you create will be unbounded. It stays 
inside a text box, but that text box automati-
cally resizes to accommodate whatever text 
you put inside it. The labels you create with 
the Label tool are examples of unbounded 
text — it’d be a pain to manually resize 
things whenever you modify a note. To turn 
an unbounded text box into a bounded one, 
just resize it with the Select tool, or choose 
Text➪Make Unbounded.
It’s no surprise that text in LayOut can be left, 
center, or right aligned, but here’s something 
you probably didn’t know: You can prescribe 
the justification of a text box by drawing it a 
certain way:
 ✓ Drag left to right to create a left-aligned 
text box.
 ✓ Drag right to left to create a right-aligned 
text box.
 ✓ Hold down Control (Option on a Mac) to 
create a center-aligned, vertically centered 
text box. You can set vertical alignment 
options (top, center, bottom) for a text box 
in the Text dialog box.

387
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
✓ SketchUp models: To get a SketchUp model view into your presentation, 
LayOut lets you insert SketchUp models directly into your document.
With every other page-layout program in the universe, the only way to 
include a view of a SketchUp model is to export that view from SketchUp as 
an image file, and then place it in the layout program. Changing the SketchUp 
file means having to go through the whole process again, and if your presen-
tation includes lots of SketchUp model views, it can take hours.
 
This brings us to LayOut’s raison d’être: Instead of exporting views from 
SketchUp to get them into LayOut, all you do is insert a SketchUp file. From 
within LayOut, you can pick the view you like best. You can also use as many 
views of the same model as you want. When your SketchUp file is modified, 
LayOut knows about it and (using the References panel in the Document Setup 
dialog box) lets you update all your views at once by clicking a single button.
In sections that follow, you find out the best tips and tricks for working with 
models, as well as how to insert other images and text.
Inserting images and model views
Regardless of which kind of image you want to insert, the procedure is the 
same; follow these steps to bring an image into your LayOut document:
 
1. Choose File➪Insert.
 
 This opens the Insert dialog box.
 
2. Find the file on your computer that you want to insert, select it, and 
click the Open button.
 
 This closes the Insert dialog box and places the image (or SketchUp 
model) you chose on your current LayOut document page.
 
3. Use the Select tool to resize your image.
 
 You can resize an image by clicking and dragging any corner.
 
 Hold down Shift while you drag to resize proportionally; you probably 
don’t want to distort your image by stretching it out.
 
4. Use the Select tool to move your image around and rotate it.
 
 Click and drag to move any element in your document around on the 
page. Use the Rotate knob (the little blue stick in the center of your 
image) to rotate. To rotate about a different point (a different center 
of rotation), just move the Rotate knob by clicking its center point and 
dragging it around.
 
 See the next section for tips on working with inserted SketchUp model 
views.

Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Working with inserted model views
Being able to choose views of your SketchUp models and put together docu-
ments to present them is what LayOut is all about. Text, vector drawing, 
raster images, and everything else aside, LayOut is a tool for presenting 
SketchUp models.
This section is about two things: managing the model views that you’ve 
inserted into your LayOut document, and controlling how they look with the 
SketchUp Model dialog box. With that binary objective in mind, read on. . . .
A bit of general advice
Figure 14-6 shows a view of a LayOut drawing window with a SketchUp model 
I inserted. The following are some things I think you should know:
 
✓ Double-click to change your view. When you’re using the Select tool, 
double-clicking a SketchUp model view allows you to orbit, pan, and 
zoom around your model. When you like what you see, click anywhere 
outside the view to exit.
 
✓ Choose Open with SketchUp to edit your SketchUp model directly. 
Choosing Open with SketchUp from the right-click context menu opens 
your model in SketchUp, where you can make any edits you want. When 
you’re done, save your SketchUp file, and then come back to LayOut; 
your view will have changed to reflect the edits you made in SketchUp.
 
✓ Do your dimensioning in SketchUp. This may seem strange, but LayOut 
doesn’t have a way to add dimensions to your drawings. Dimensions you 
add in SketchUp show up in LayOut, though, so feel free to add them 
there.
 
✓ Create scenes in SketchUp to make life easier in LayOut. In the 
SketchUp Model dialog box (which I talk about in a bit) you can pick a 
scene. This is incredibly convenient, because getting just the right view 
can be easier in SketchUp than it is in LayOut. If you know which views 
you need, create scenes in SketchUp and then choose them in LayOut. 
See Chapter 10 for details about creating scenes.
The SketchUp Model dialog box
Take a look at Figure 14-7. It shows the SketchUp Model dialog box, which is 
bigger and better (much better) than ever in LayOut 2. It’s dense, but it’s 100 
percent worth getting familiar with — managing the controls here will shave 
hours off of your workflow. Here’s what all the gizmos and widgets do:

✓ Scene: Lets you choose a scene from your SketchUp model to apply to 
your model view LayOut. Because your modeling window in SketchUp 
probably isn’t the same aspect ratio (proportions) as your image box in 
LayOut, it might not look exactly the same, though.
 
✓ Show your model at scale: The next part of the SketchUp model dialog 
box is where you set things up to display your model at a pre-defined 
scale. Here’s how:
 
1. Select the model view in your LayOut file that you want to display 
at scale.
 
2. Click Ortho to switch off perspective.
 
3. Choose a view (top, side, back) from the Standard View drop-
down list.
 
4. Choose a scale from the (unlabeled) Scale drop-down list.
 
✓ Preserve scale on resize: When this check box is selected, scaling the 
box that contains your model view doesn’t scale the model view itself. 
You can effectively use the Select tool to crop your model view by 
changing the size and shape of its container.
 
✓ Shadows: Turns on and off shadows in your model view. Also lets you 
set the date and time of day to control the position of the shadows.
 
✓ Fog: Turns on and off Fog in your model view, using the settings you last 
applied to the model in SketchUp. Also lets you set the color of the fog.
 
✓ Render and Auto: When the Auto check box is selected, LayOut auto-
matically renders (redraws) your model view every time you change 
something about it — its style, shadows, container shape — you get 
the idea. If your model is big and heavy, you have to wait while LayOut 
works, and that can get old, fast.
 
 Deselecting the Auto check box lets you decide when LayOut should 
render your model view. Just click Render to tell LayOut to start cranking.
 
✓ Rendering style drop-down: This list is so much more important than 
its location in this dialog box implies. Changing the setting here affects 
the way your model looks, how it prints, and how long LayOut takes to 
go about its business. There are your options:
 
• Raster: Renders your SketchUp model view as an image made up 
of many, many little dots (check out Chapter 13 for more thorough 
explanation of the terms raster and vector). The upshot: If your 
model is rendered as a raster, it can display sketchy Styles, shad-
ows, and other effects that make it look like it does in SketchUp. 
On the other hand, printing or exporting a raster image at large 
sizes required it to have a very high pixel count, and that can make 
LayOut choke. If you use too low a resolution (LayOut refers to 

391
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
resolution as Quality), your model will look jaggy and miserable. 
The answer, if you’re dealing with a big piece of paper, is to render 
your model views as vector images — or hybrid ones, as you’ll see 
in a couple of words.
 
• Vector: Renders your selected model view as a vector image. Lines 
appear smooth and crisp, but things like shadows, textures, and 
sketchy Styles don’t show up. You should choose vector rendering 
for model views that are line-heavy, like monochrome plans and 
sections at scale. Choosing vector rendering for really big models 
can take a while to process — just a warning.
 
• Hybrid: Combines vector lines with raster faces, shadows, and 
other goodies. Always try hybrid rendering if you have time, just to 
see if you like how it looks.
 
✓ Styles: Clicking this tab at the top of the dialog box lets you pick the 
Style that’s applied to your model. Pretty straightforward, but this panel 
also includes a couple of other interesting controls:
 
• Tweak your line weights: Here, you can change the weight (thick-
ness) of the lines in your model view. The default value is .50, but 
the setting you need depends a lot on your model, its Style, and 
how big your document is. Fiddle with this number until you like 
what you see.
 
• Background: Selecting this check box shows the background of 
your SketchUp model view. Deselecting it drops out the back-
ground, making your model look like it’s floating in front of what-
ever’s behind it in LayOut.
Inserting text
You can insert a third type of content into LayOut documents: text. This is 
useful if the text you want to use is already typed, spell-checked, proofread, 
and ready to present.
Insert a text file the same way you do an image, but keep in mind that it has 
to be an RTF (Rich Text Format) or TXT file. Luckily, any text editor (like 
Word or TextEdit) can save to these formats.
Presentation-Perfect Images
After you import content, it’s generally not quite presentation-ready. You 
may want to crop images or use the drawing tools to create a professional-
looking, well-organized layout. The following sections show you how.

392
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Cropping with clipping masks
Cropping an image means reframing it so that you can only see part of it; 
every page-layout program on the planet allows you to crop images, and each 
one insists that you do it a little differently. LayOut is no exception.
In LayOut, you use clipping masks to hide the parts of images that you don’t 
want to see. Follow these steps to use a shape as a clipping mask. See 
Figure 14-8:
 
1. Draw the shape you want to use as a clipping mask.
 
2. Make sure that it’s positioned properly over the image you want to crop.
 
3. Use the Select tool to select both the clipping mask object and the 
image you want to crop.
 
 Hold down Shift while clicking to select more than one object.
 
4. Right-click the selected elements and choose Create Clipping Mask 
from the context menu.
 
Figure 14-8: 
Use clipping 
masks to 
hide parts 
of images 
you insert.
 

393
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
Here are some fun facts about clipping masks in LayOut:
 
✓ Clipping masks work on inserted images. These include pictures and 
SketchUp models that you place in your LayOut document.
 
✓ Deleting clipping masks is easy. To see a whole image again, you 
need to “release” its clipping mask. Select the image and then choose 
Edit➪Release Clipping Mask.
 
✓ Edit clipping masks by double-clicking them. When you double-click 
a clipping mask, you can see the whole image and the shape you used 
to create the mask. Now you can modify the shape, the image, or both. 
Clicking somewhere else on your page exits the edit mode.
Curves are back
The Line tool in LayOut 2 has a secret: It’s quite 
simply the most intuitive Bézier curve vector 
drawing tool I’ve ever used — and I’ve used a lot. 
In vector software (like LayOut and Illustrator), 
you can draw curved lines freehand, but they 
don’t usually look very good. It’s hard to draw 
smooth, flowing curves without some assis-
tance, and that’s where the Line tool comes in. 
Learning to use them usually takes a little getting 
used to, but once you do, it’s hard to go back.
So what makes LayOut’s Line tool so great? 
Two things, actually:
 ✓ It’s hooked up to the inference system. 
SketchUp and LayOut share a similar “guid-
ance” system of colorful points and lines 
that help you figure out where you are. By 
turning on Object Snap when you’re draw-
ing, you’ll be able to line things up and draw 
more accurately.
 ✓ Draw and edit with two tools. You use the 
Line tool to draw curves (and straight lines, 
of course), and then you do all of your edit-
ing with the Select tool. Compared to curve 
tools in other software, LayOut does a lot 
more with a lot less.
Here are some pointers on creating and editing 
curves with the Line tool:
 ✓ Click-click-click to draw straight line 
segments. It works just like the Line tool in 
SketchUp.
 ✓ Click-drag-release to draw curved line 
segments. You “shape” your curve while 
you’re dragging.
 ✓ Double-click with the Select tool to edit. 
When you do, you’ll see all of your line’s 
control points and handles (the antenna-
looking things that poke out of your control 
points). Click and drag points and handles 
to edit your line, then click somewhere else 
to stop editing.
 ✓ Drag a control point on top of an adjacent 
point to delete it. If you want to get rid of a 
control point while you’re editing a line, just 
drag it onto one of its neighbors.
 ✓ Hold down Control and click somewhere 
on your line to add a point. Hold down 
Option on a Mac.
 ✓ Hold down Control and drag on a point to 
pull out curve handles. That’s the Option 
key on a Mac.
 ✓ Hold down Control and drag on a handle to 
sharpen a curve. 

394
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
Drawing something from scratch
LayOut includes a full slate of drawing tools that you can use to create logos, 
title bars, north arrows, graphic scales — anything you want. The drawings 
you create are vectors, meaning that you can do the following:
 
✓ Scale them without losing quality
 
✓ Change their fill and stroke (outline) colors
 
✓ Split lines and then rejoin them to make new shapes
Because I don’t know what you want to draw, a step list would be pretty 
pointless here. Instead, here are a few pointers to get you started:
 
✓ Use the right kind of snaps. It’s easier to draw exactly what you want 
if you let the software help a bit. Just like SketchUp, LayOut includes an 
elaborate (but easy-to-use) inference system of red and green dots and 
lines to help you line things up. LayOut also allows you to use a grid 
(that you define) to help you keep things straight:
 
• Snap to objects: Choose Arrange➪Object Snap to turn on object 
snapping; this gives you colored hints to help you draw.
 
• Snap to grid: Choose Arrange➪Grid Snap to turn on grid snapping. 
Now your cursor automatically snaps to (is attracted to) the inter-
section of grid lines in your document — whether your grid is vis-
ible or not. See the section “Getting Your Bearings,” earlier in this 
chapter, for more information on using grids in LayOut.
 
 You can use any combination of snapping systems (Object or Grid) 
while you’re working, but I prefer to use one or the other — it all 
depends on what I’m trying to do. To save time, I assign a keyboard 
shortcut that toggles each system on and off. (To do that, use the 
Shortcuts panel in the Preferences dialog box, which you can find in the 
Edit menu — on a Mac, it’s in the LayOut menu.)
 
✓ You can type in measurement and angles. LayOut has a Measurements 
box (in the lower-right corner), just like the one in SketchUp. Take a look 
at Chapter 2 for tips on working accurately with Measurements.
 
✓ Build complex shapes out of simpler ones. I’ll use an example here: 
Figure 14-9 shows how I would draw a simple arrow. You can follow 
these steps to build one just like it:

395
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
1. Make sure that Grid Snap is turned off and Object Snap is turned on.
 
2. Draw a rectangle with the Rectangle tool.
 
3. Draw a triangle with the Polygon tool. (Type in 3s and press Enter 
before you start drawing to make sure that you’re drawing a trian-
gle.) Hold down Shift to make sure that the bottom of the triangle 
is a horizontal line.
 
4. Shift+click to select both shapes.
 
5. Choose Arrange➪Align➪Vertically to line up the rectangle and the 
triangle vertically.
 
 Don’t forget that you can always use the Undo feature to go back a 
step; it’s in the Edit menu whenever you need it.
 
6. Deselect both shapes by clicking once somewhere else on your page.
 
7. Select one of the shapes and move it up or down on the page (by 
pressing the up- and down-arrow keys) until the two shapes overlap.
 
8. Use the Arc tool to draw a half-circle at the bottom of the rectangle.
 
9. Using the Split tool, click and hold down each of the points of inter-
section in the figure; don’t let go until all the lines stop flashing 
blue. Do this for all four intersection points to split the shapes into 
a series of line segments.
 
10. Use the Join tool (it looks like a bottle of glue) to connect all the 
line segments by clicking once on the “arrowhead” part, once on 
each half of the “stem” part, and once on the half-circle. Now you 
have one shape instead of three; verify this by clicking the shape 
once with the Select tool. You should see one red “selected” rect-
angle around your new shape. If you don’t have one shape, try 
using the Join tool again; sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get 
things to work.
 
11. Move your new shape somewhere else, and then delete the left-
over line segments you don’t need.
 
✓ Open the Shape Style dialog box. You use the Shape Style dialog box to 
change the fill and stroke characteristics of elements in your document. 
(See Figure 14-10.) In plain English, this is where you pick colors for the 
things you draw. The controls are pretty straightforward, so you don’t 
need much help from me; just experiment and see what happens.

Living Life after LayOut
After you’ve created your LayOut document, you can do the following four 
things:
 
✓ Print it
 
✓ Export it as a PDF file
 
✓ Export it as an image file
 
✓ View it as a full-screen presentation
Simple, huh? The next three sections provide some more detail on each of 
these options.
Printing your work
Follow these steps to print your LayOut document:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.

398
Part IV: Sharing What You’ve Made 
 
 In the Print dialog box, choose which pages to print and how many 
copies you want.
 
2. Click the OK button to send your document to the printer.
Exporting a PDF
Anyone with Adobe Reader software (which is free and is already loaded on 
millions of computers) can look at a PDF document you create; all you have 
to do is e-mail it to him or her. Follow these steps to export your LayOut 
document as a PDF file:
 
1. Choose File➪Export➪PDF.
 
 If you’re on a Mac, choose File➪Export, then make sure PDF is selected 
in the Export dialog box. This opens the Export PDF dialog box.
 
2. Give your PDF file a name, and figure out where to save it on your 
computer.
 
3. Click the Save button (in Windows) to open the PDF Export Options 
dialog box (see Figure 14-11); click the Options button if you’re on a Mac.
 
4. Set the PDF options the way you want them.
 
 Here’s what everything means:
 
• Page: Choose which pages you want to export.
 
• Quality: See the section “Creating a new, blank document,” earlier 
in this chapter, for a brief discussion about Output Quality. Here’s 
a good rule of thumb: For documents that are small enough to be 
hand-held, I recommend a setting of High. For anything bigger, go 
with Medium or Low.
 
• Layers: PDFs can have layers, just like LayOut documents do. If it 
makes sense to do so, you can export a layered PDF so that people 
who view it can turn the layers on and off.
 
• Finish: Select this check box to view your PDF after it’s exported.
 
5. Mac only: Click the OK button to close the PDF Options dialog box.
 
6. Click the Export button (Save button on a Mac) to export your docu-
ment as a PDF file.
Exporting an image file
 
In LayOut 2, you can export the pages of your file as individual raster images in 
either JPEG or PNG format. Take a look at the first part of Chapter 13 for more 
information on the differences between JPEG and PNG if you need to. Follow 
these steps to export your LayOut document as one or more image files:

399
 Chapter 14: Creating Presentation Documents with LayOut
 
1. Choose File➪Export➪Images.
 
 If you’re on a Mac, choose File➪Export, then make sure PNG or JPEG is 
selected in the Export dialog box. This opens the Export Image dialog box.
 
2. Name your file and tell LayOut where to save it on your computer.
 
3. Click the Save button (Options on a Mac).
 
 The Image Export Options dialog box opens; see Figure 14-12.
 
4. Set the Image Export options.
 
 Here’s what everything means:
 
• Pages: Choose which pages you want to export. Each page in your 
LayOut document exports as a separate image file.
 
• Size: See the section “Making sure that you’re exporting enough 
pixels” in Chapter 13 for a complete rundown on pixel size and 
image resolution.
 
• Finish: Select this check box to view your image after it’s exported.
 
5. Mac only: Click the OK button to close the Image Options dialog box.
 
6. Click the Export button (Save button on a Mac) to export your docu-
ment as one or more image files.

Going full-screen
Many times, design presentations for clients go beyond printed boards and 
booklets; they include a digital slide show that usually involves a few hours 
of work in a program like PowerPoint or Keynote (if you’re on a Mac).
 
LayOut was designed to help you skip the PowerPoint step by letting you dis-
play your presentation in a full-screen view. You can move back and forth 
between pages with the arrow keys on your computer, and you can even dou-
ble-click SketchUp model views to orbit them around. Follow these tips:
 
✓ Switching to full-screen Presentation mode takes less than a second. 
Choose View➪Start Presentation to view your presentation full-screen. 
Press Esc to exit full-screen mode.
 
✓ Specify where you want your presentation to appear. Use the 
Presentation panel in the Preferences dialog box to tell SketchUp which 
monitor (or projector) you’d like to use to show your presentation.
 
✓ Move from page to page. Use the left- and right-arrow keys to flip 
through pages.
 
✓ Choose which pages to show full-screen. You can decide not to show 
certain pages in full-screen mode by toggling the ”Show page in presen-
tations” icon to the right of those page names in the Pages dialog box 
(make sure that you’re in List view to be able to do this).
 
✓ Double-click to change your view of a SketchUp model. When you’re in 
full-screen mode, you can double-click any SketchUp model view to orbit 
and zoom around inside it. Just use your mouse’s scroll wheel button the 
same way you do in SketchUp. Click anywhere outside the view to exit.
 
✓ Draw while you’re in full-screen mode. Try clicking and dragging while 
you’re in full-screen mode; doing so lets you make red annotations right 
on your presentation. If a client doesn’t like the porch you designed, 
scrawl a big, red X over it to let him know you understand. When you hit 
Escape to exit Presentation Mode, you can choose to save your annota-
tions as a separate layer.
 
✓ Play scene animations right in full-screen mode. You can double-click, 
then right-click a model view with scenes that you’ve set up in SketchUp 
and choose Play Animation. LayOut will transition from scene to scene, 
just like SketchUp does. You can read more about scenes in Chapter 10.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
L
et’s face it, everybody loves lists. The last part of this 
book (and of every For Dummies book out there) is 
dedicated to presenting useful information in short, bite-
sized chunks that you can read while you’re standing in 
the elevator. Or using the bathroom. Or waiting for your 
turn in the shower.
Chapter 15 is a list of the problems that every new 
SketchUp user runs into — check here when you’re ready 
to pour acid all over your keyboard and move to Amish 
country.
The list in Chapter 16 is mostly about promoting consum-
erism, but it’s also handy if you’re wondering what else is 
available that can improve the way you use SketchUp.
The last chapter in this book is, fittingly, about ten ways 
that you can keep discovering more about SketchUp — 
places to go, books to read, DVDs to watch. I’m a firm 
believer that the best way to figure out anything is to see 
it presented in more than one way, so I highly encourage 
you to check out at least a couple of these resources.

Ten SketchUp Traps and
Their Workarounds
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why faces, colors, and edges aren’t behaving right
▶ Coping with a slow or crashing SketchUp
▶ Viewing your model the way you want
▶ Persuading components to budge
▶ Recovering from Eraser disasters
T
he bad news is that every single new SketchUp user encounters certain 
problems, usually in the first couple of hours using the software. I guess 
you could call these problems growing pains. The good news is that such 
predictability means that I can write a chapter that anticipates a lot of the 
bad stuff you’ll go through. I can’t prevent it from happening, but I can help 
you make sense of what’s going on so you can get on with your life as quickly 
as possible.
SketchUp Won’t Create a Face 
Where I Want It To
You’ve dutifully traced all around where you’d like SketchUp to create a face, 
but nothing’s happening. Try checking whether your edges aren’t all on the 
same plane or whether one edge is part of a separate group or component.

404
Part V: The Part of Tens 
To check whether you have a component problem, try hiding groups or com-
ponents and checking the edges to make sure that they’re all in the group or 
component you think they’re in. See Chapter 5 for details.
 
However, 90 percent of the time when SketchUp doesn’t create a face where 
you think it should, an edge isn’t on the plane you think it’s on. To check 
whether your edges are coplanar, draw an edge that cuts diagonally across 
the area where you want a face to appear. If a face appears now, your edges 
aren’t all on the same plane. To fix the problem, you have to figure out which 
edge is the culprit. 
I call my favorite method for doing this the Color by Axis method; Color Plate 
20 shows images of the steps that I describe:
 
1. In the Styles dialog box, change your edge color from All Same to 
By Axis.
 
 See Chapter 9 for details. SketchUp draws the edges in your model the 
color of the axis to which they’re parallel; edges parallel to the red axis 
will be red, and so on.
 
2. Look carefully at the edges you were hoping would define a face.
 
 Are all the edges the color they’re supposed to be? If they’re not all sup-
posed to be parallel to the drawing axes, this technique doesn’t do much 
good. But if they are, and one (or more) of them is black (instead of red 
or green or blue), that edge (or edges) is your problem child. Fix it and 
switch back to All Same when you’re done.
My Faces Are Two Different Colors
 
In SketchUp, faces have two sides: a front and a back. By default, these two 
sides are different colors. 
When you do certain things like use Push/Pull or Follow Me on a face, some-
times the faces on the resulting geometry are “inside out.” If it bothers you to 
have a two-tone model (I know it bothers me), right-click the faces you want 
to flip over and choose Reverse Faces from the context menu. If you have lots 
of them, you can select them all and then choose Reverse Faces to do them 
all at once.

405
 Chapter 15: Ten SketchUp Traps and Their Workarounds
Edges on a Face Won’t Sink In
 
This tends to happen when you’re trying to draw a rectangle (or another geo-
metric figure) on a face with one of SketchUp’s shape-drawing tools. 
Ordinarily, the Rectangle tool creates a new face on top of any face you use it 
on; after that, you can use Push/Pull to create a hole, if you want. 
If your shape’s edges look thick instead of thin, they’re not cutting through 
the face they’re drawn on. When that happens, try these approaches:
 
✓ Retrace one of the edges. Sometimes that works — you’d be surprised 
how often.
 
✓ Select Hidden Geometry from the View menu. You’re checking to make 
sure that the face you just drew isn’t crossing any hidden or smoothed 
edges; if it is, the face you thought was flat might not be.
 
✓ Make sure that the face you drew on isn’t part of a group or compo-
nent. If it is, undo a few steps and then redraw your shape while you’re 
editing the group or component.
SketchUp Crashed and I Lost My Model
Unfortunately, SketchUp crashes happen sometimes. 
The good news is that SketchUp automatically saves a copy of your file every 
five minutes. The file that SketchUp auto saves is actually a separate file, which 
it calls AutoSave_your filename.skp. If your file ever gets corrupted in a 
crash, an intact file is ready for you to find and continue working on. 
The problem is that most people don’t even know it’s there. Where is it?
 
✓ If you’ve ever saved your file, it’s in the same folder as the original.
 
✓ If you’ve never saved your file, it’s in your My Documents folder — 
unless you’re on a Mac, in which case it’s here:
User folder/Library/Application Support/
Google SketchUp 7/SketchUp/Autosave
Keep in mind that SketchUp normally cleans up after itself by deleting the 
auto saved file when you close your model, and nothing untoward happens.

406
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
To minimize the amount of work you lose when software (or hardware) goes 
south, you should always do two things: 
 
✓ Save often. Compulsively, even. 
 
✓ Save numbered copies as you’re working. I use Save As to create a new 
copy of my work every half-hour or so. When I’m building a big model, 
it’s not uncommon for me to have 40 or 50 saved versions of it on my 
computer, dating back to when I first started working on it.
SketchUp Is Sooooo Slooooooooow
The bigger your model gets, the worse your performance gets, too. What makes 
a model big? In a nutshell, faces. You should do everything in your power to 
keep your model as small as you can. Here are some tips for doing that:
 
✓ Reduce the number of sides on your extruded circles and arcs. See the 
sidebar in Chapter 6 for instructions on how to do this.
 
✓ Use 2D people and trees instead of 3D ones. 3D plants and people have 
hundreds of faces each. Consider using 2D ones instead, especially if 
your model won’t be seen much from overhead.
Some models are just big, and you can’t do much about it. Here are some 
tricks for working with very large SketchUp models:
 
✓ Make liberal use of the Outliner and layers. Explained in detail in 
Chapter 7, these SketchUp features were specifically designed to let you 
organize your model into manageable chunks. Hide everything you’re 
not working on at the moment — doing so gives your computer a fight-
ing chance.
 
✓ Use substitution for large numbers of complex components. For exam-
ple, insert sticks as placeholders for big sets of 3D trees, cars, and other 
big components. See the tips for replacing components in Chapter 5 for 
details.
 
✓ Turn off shadows and switch to a simple style. It takes a lot of com-
puter horsepower to display shadows, edge effects, and textures in real 
time on your monitor. When you’re working, turn off all that stuff.
 
✓ Use scenes to navigate between views. Scenes aren’t just for present-
ing your model — they’re also great for working with it. Creating scenes 
for the different views you commonly use, and with different combina-
tions of hidden geometry, means that you don’t have to orbit, pan, and 
zoom around your gigantic model. Better yet, deselect Enable Scene 
Transitions (in the Animation panel of the Model Info dialog box) to 
speed things up even more.

407
 Chapter 15: Ten SketchUp Traps and Their Workarounds
I Can’t Get a Good View of 
the Inside of My Model
 
It’s not always easy to work on the inside of something in SketchUp. You can 
do these things to make it easier, though:
 
✓ Cut into it with sections: SketchUp’s Sections feature lets you cut away 
parts of your model — temporarily, of course — so that you can get a 
better view of what’s inside. Take a look at Chapter 10 for the whole 
story on sections.
 
✓ Widen your field of view: Field of view is basically the amount of your 
model you can see on the screen at one time. A wider FOV is like having 
better peripheral vision. You can read all about it in Chapter 10.
A Face Flashes When I Orbit
 
If you have two faces in the same spot — maybe one is in a separate group or 
component — you see an effect called Z-fighting. SketchUp is deciding which 
face to display by switching back and forth between them. It’s not a good solu-
tion, but certainly a logical one — at least for a piece of software. The only 
way to get rid of Z-fighting is to delete or hide one of the faces.
I Can’t Move My Component
the Way I Want
 
Some components are set up to automatically glue to faces when you insert 
them into your model. A glued component instance isn’t actually glued in one 
place. Instead, it’s glued to the plane of the face you originally placed (or cre-
ated) it on. For example, if you place a sofa component on the floor of your 
living room, you can only move it around on that plane — not up and down. 
This behavior comes in handy when you’re dealing with things like furniture. 
It allows you to use the Move tool to rearrange things without having to 
worry about accidentally picking them up.
If you can’t move your component the way you want to, right-click it and 
check to see whether Unglue is an option — if it is, choose it. Now you can

Bad Stuff Happens Every Time
I Use the Eraser
It’s pretty easy to delete stuff accidentally with the Eraser tool. Worse yet, 
you usually don’t notice what’s missing until it’s too late. Here are some tips 
for erasing more accurately:
 
✓ Orbit around. Try to make sure that nothing is behind whatever it is 
you’re erasing; use SketchUp’s navigation tools to get a view of your 
model that puts you out of danger.
 
✓ Switch to Wireframe mode. Choose View➪Face Style➪Wireframe when 
you’re going to be using the Eraser heavily. That way, you won’t have 
any faces to obstruct your view, and you’ll be less likely to erase the 
wrong edges.
 
✓ Double-check. I’ve gotten into the habit of giving my model a quick 
once-over with the Orbit tool after I do a lot of erasing, just to make 
sure that I didn’t get rid of anything important. Put a sticky note on your 
computer monitor that says something like CHECK AFTER ERASE! just to 
remind yourself.
All My Edges and Faces Are 
on Different Layers
 
I’ll be blunt — using Layers in SketchUp is a dangerous business. Chapter 7 
has tips you should follow when using layers, so I won’t repeat them here, but 
here’s the short version: You should always build everything on Layer0, and 
only put whole groups or components on other layers if you really need to.
If you used layers, and now things are messed up, here’s what you can do 
to recover:
 
1. Make sure that everything is visible.
 
 Select Hidden Geometry on the View menu; then (in the Layers dialog 
box) make all your layers visible. Just make sure that you can see every-
thing in your model.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Select All.
 
3. In the Entity Info dialog box, move everything to Layer0.
 
4. In the Layers dialog box, delete your other layers. When prompted, 
tell SketchUp to move anything remaining on them to Layer0.
 
5. Create new layers and follow the rules in Chapter 7.

Ten Plugins, Extensions, and 
Resources Worth Getting
In This Chapter
▶ Places to find more components
▶ Scripts that make your life easier and add power to SketchUp
▶ Software for making your SketchUp views look like photographs
▶ Fun hardware add-ons
T
he really great thing about SketchUp’s price is how much room it frees 
up in your budget for nifty add-ons. This chapter is a list of ten such nifty 
add-ons, along with a little bit of information about them and where you can 
go to find them. I’ve split them up into four categories, just to make things 
clearer: components, Ruby scripts, renderers, and hardware.
Components
Why make your own sofa when you can grab one from somewhere else? 
If the zillions of components that you can download from the Google 3D 
Warehouse aren’t enough for you (see Chapter 5 for more information about 
this), the following sections provide some additional Web sites where you 
can buy what you need.
Form Fonts
Form Fonts (www.formfonts.com) is a Web site that sells components “all 
you can eat, buffet style.” You pay a (surprisingly low) monthly fee, and you 
have access to thousands of high-quality models of just about anything you can 

410
Part V: The Part of Tens 
think of. Form Fonts’ international team of modelers even takes requests — if 
you need something that they don’t have, they can probably make it if you ask 
nicely. In addition to components, Form Fonts also has tons of extra materials 
you can apply to your work, as well as a growing library of styles. Even if you’re 
not interested in signing up, it’s worth checking out the Web site just to see the 
beautiful models Form Fonts makes.
Sketchupmodels.com
Along the same lines as Form Fonts, Sketchupmodels.com is an online spot 
where you can buy SketchUp components. This place isn’t a buffet, though; 
you only buy what you need, à la carte. Some of its models might seem a 
little expensive, but when you consider how much time it would take you to 
make them yourself, it might be worth it to buy them — especially if you use 
SketchUp for work.
Ruby Scripts
What’s a Ruby script, you ask? Basically, Google provides a way for people to 
make their own plugins for SketchUp. These plugins are just mini-programs 
(scripts) written in a computer programming language called Ruby. The best 
thing about Ruby scripts (Rubies, for short) is that you don’t have to know 
anything about Ruby, or programming in general, to use ones that other 
people have created.
To install Rubies, you just drop them into a special folder on your computer:
 
✓ Windows: C:/Program Files/Google/Google SketchUp 7/
Plugins
 
✓ Mac: Hard Drive/Library/Application Support/Google 
SketchUp 7/SketchUp/Plugins
The next time you launch SketchUp, Rubies you put in the preceding location 
become available for you to use. How you use them depends on what they 
do. They might show up on one of the toolbar menus or on your right-click 
context menu. The more complex ones even come with their own little tool-
bars. Helpfully, most Rubies also come with a set of instructions that tells 
you how to use them.
Luckily for those of us who aren’t programmers, plenty of smart folks out 
there develop and (in some cases) sell Rubies that anyone can use. Here are 
three places you can go to find some.

411
 Chapter 16: Ten Plugins, Extensions, and Resources Worth Getting
Smustard.com
Smustard.com (www.smustard.com) is a Web site run by a few of these 
smart folks. You can choose from dozens of helpful Rubies that add function-
ality to SketchUp, and best of all, they’re very inexpensive. Some of my favor-
ites include the following:
 
✓ Weld: This Ruby takes edges you’ve selected and welds them together 
to make a single edge that you can select with a single click. This is super 
handy when you’re using Follow Me.
 
✓ Drop: This takes a bunch of groups or components that you’ve selected 
and drops them down in the blue direction until each hits a surface. If 
you’re trying to populate a sloping hillside with trees, it’s much easier 
to make a big, flat grid of them in the air, then Drop them down to meet 
the ground.
 
✓ Subdivide and Smooth: If you’re interested in organic modeling — stuff 
that isn’t boxy or otherwise angular — you should take a look at this 
one. Basically, it lets you create smooth, blobby (I mean that in a good 
way) forms based on proxies (boxes, sort of) that you manipulate. It 
much cooler and more versatile than it sounds, though. Try searching 
YouTube for sketchup subdivide and smooth to see some videos of 
what it can do.
 
✓ Windowizer: This one helps you create storefront windows much more 
quickly than you could manually.
 
✓ PresentationBundle: This package of five Rubies helps you use scenes 
to create better presentations. You can customize the transition time 
between individual scenes, for instance, and even create really elaborate 
fly-by animations.
 
✓ CAD cleanup scripts: If you routinely import 2D CAD drawings to 
use as a starting point for SketchUp models, you need these scripts. 
Without going into any detail, here’s a list of the CAD cleanup scripts 
you should hunt for on Smustard: StrayLines, CloseOpens, MakeFaces, 
IntersectOverlaps, Flatten, and DeleteShortLines.
Ruby Library Depot
The Ruby Library Depot (search for ruby library depot on the Web) is a 
huge collection of Rubies from helpful software developers around the world. 
You’ll find tons of stuff to make your SketchUp life better there, but here are 
two you shouldn’t miss:

412
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Joint Push Pull: Wouldn’t it be great if you could push/pull curved sur-
faces to give them thickness? With this plugin, you can. Even better, it 
comes with great documentation when you download it.
 
✓ Tools on Surface: Use these drawing tools — Line, Offset, Circle, 
Rectangle, Freehand — to draw directly on non-flat surfaces like terrain.
SketchyPhysics
This is only one plugin (so I’m not sure that it really needs its own giant 
heading) but it’s so earth-shatteringly cool that I couldn’t leave it out. 
SketchyPhysics (search for sketchyphysics on the Web) is an extension that 
lets you apply real-world physical constraints (like gravity) to your SketchUp 
models. You can, for instance, set up a row of dominoes, tip one over, and 
watch them all fall down. Or build a machine with wheels, pistons, and 
other mechanical parts and set it in motion. Search for sketchyphysics on 
YouTube to see some unbelievable videos of folks using it. As of this writing, 
SketchyPhysics only works on Windows machines, but I’ve heard rumors that 
a Mac version might be in the works.
Renderers
One thing SketchUp does not do is create photorealistic renderings. Its styles 
are great for making your models look hand drawn, but none of them can 
make your work look like a photograph. Most SketchUp users are okay with 
that, but for those who aren’t, you can find some nice solutions out there.
 
Of course, SketchUp Pro’s 3D export formats make it possible to render SKP 
files with just about any of the dozens of über-powerful renderers on the 
market, but the ones that I describe in the following list have three important 
things in common: They work with the free version of SketchUp, they were 
developed with SketchUp in mind, and you don’t have to work for George 
Lucas to figure them out. Here’s the list:
 
✓ SU Podium (www.suplugins.com): SU Podium is a plugin that lets you 
create photorealistic views right inside SketchUp. It’s relatively inexpen-
sive, straightforward to use, and the results you get are impressive. SU 
Podium is available for both Windows and Mac, and there’s a free, lower-
resolution trial version you can get to see if it suits you.
 
✓ IDX Renditioner (www.idx-design.com): This software evolved from 
another renderer called TurboSketch. Like SU Podium, it’s a plugin, it’s 
available for Windows and Mac computers, and you can try a free version 
that creates smaller (640 x 480 pixels) images. I recommend trying both 
SU Podium and IDX Renditioner, and seeing which one you prefer. 

413
 Chapter 16: Ten Plugins, Extensions, and Resources Worth Getting
 
✓ Artlantis R (www.artlantis.com): If you’re really serious about 
making images that look like photographs, take a good look at Artlantis 
R. Instead of running as a plugin inside SketchUp, it’s a fully functional, 
separate piece of software that works with lots of other 3D modeling 
programs. Its results are out of this world.
 
Like I mentioned earlier, lots of rendering applications are out there, and 
depending on what you want to do, different ones might work better than 
others. If photo rendering is your thing, try plugging these names into your 
favorite search engine: Kerkythea, Maxwell, Cheetah3D, and Vue. They’re hard 
core, but they all work great.
Hardware
All you really need to use SketchUp is a computer with a decent video card, a 
keyboard, and a mouse. On the other hand, having specialized hardware can 
come in handy — especially if you find yourself using SketchUp all the time:
 
✓ A better video card: This isn’t really an option if you’re on a laptop, 
but if you use a desktop machine, upgrading your computer’s video 
card (also called a graphics card) is the single best way to improve your 
SketchUp experience. Your video card is a piece of hardware that han-
dles the stuff that shows up on your screen. Not all cards are made to be 
used with 3D modeling programs — not even some that are made specif-
ically for whiz-bang video games. What you’re looking for is something 
that supports OpenGL 1.5 or higher and has a lot of video memory; the 
more, the better. I’ve heard good things about cards made by NVIDIA 
and ATI.
 
✓ SpaceNavigator from 3Dconnexion: Using a scroll-wheel mouse to fly 
around in three-dimensional space works great for most people, but 
lots of SketchUp power users swear by dedicated 3D navigation tools 
like the SpaceNavigator. It looks a little like an enormous button that 
sits on your desk, connected to your computer via a USB cable. You 
use it with whatever hand isn’t on your mouse; it’s an add-on (and not 
a replacement) for any other peripheral in your system. Basically, the 
SpaceNavigator lets you orbit, pan, and zoom with subtle movements of 
your hand — it really is a much more natural way to interact with a 3D 
model. You’ll find a bit of a learning curve, but that’s nothing for serious 
SketchUp users. Anything that makes software easier and more fun to 
use is worth the time it takes to master it.

Ten Ways to Discover Even More
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out some great, free SketchUp information
▶ Discovering other helpful resources
D
on’t get me wrong — it’s not that I think this book is woefully incom-
plete. It’s just that I don’t think it’s possible to get too many different 
forms of information, especially about something as dynamic as SketchUp. 
You can find some great help resources out there, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t 
point you to some of them.
The first half of this chapter is devoted to the free stuff; it’s all online and it’s 
all available to anyone who wants it. In the second half of the chapter, I list 
some of the best nonfree SketchUp resources I know of. If you’re willing to 
shell out a few bucks, you won’t be sorry — nothing beats seeing the same 
information presented in different ways.
 
Incidentally, this is probably a good place to mention the dozens of free 
videos that I produced to accompany this book. You can link to them from 
this book’s Web site (www.dummies.com/go/sketchupfd), but you can 
also get to them directly on YouTube. To hear my (surprisingly Muppet-like) 
voice while I put SketchUp through its paces, check out www.youtube.com/
aidanchopra.

Put Away Your Wallet
I have a confession to make: At fancy receptions, I’m the one stuffing my 
suit pockets with hors d’oeuvres wrapped in napkins. I love free stuff that 
much. So without further ado, what follows are six complimentary sources of 
SketchUp help.
 
Everything in this section requires that you have an Internet connection, so 
make sure that your computer’s online before you try any of these.
 
✓ Official SketchUp Training Resources (http://sketchup.google.
com/training): Google itself publishes really first-rate learning materials 
for SketchUp right on its Web site:
 
• Video Tutorials: When SketchUp was first launched in 2000, it 
became known for its excellent video tutorials. I can’t recommend 
them highly enough; there’s nothing like seeing SketchUp in action.
 
• Self-Paced Tutorials: These are SketchUp files that use scenes to 
teach different aspects of the program in a “follow along with me” 
style. If this is how you like to figure things out, have a look.
 
✓ Online Help Center: Google maintains big, extensive help centers (Web 
sites, basically) for all its products. These include hundreds of articles 
in question-and-answer format, created specifically to help new users 
along. The easiest way to get to the SketchUp Help Center is to choose 
Help➪Help Center from the SketchUp menu bar.
 
✓ Google SketchUp Help Group (http://groups.google.com/group/
sketchup): The SketchUp Help Group is an online discussion forum 
where SketchUp users from all over the world can get help, ask ques-
tions, and show off their work.
 
✓ SketchUcation (www.sketchucation.com): Home of the SketchUp 
Community Forums, this is easily the largest and most active group of 
SketchUp users in the world. You’ll find discussions, tutorials, plugins, 
news, and piles of other good stuff at SketchUcation.
 
✓ School Podcasts (www.go-2-school.com): These guys have a terrific 
Web site. Check out the Podcasts area for a list of great, free online 
videos they’ve put together. They also have a couple of great learning 
DVDs you can buy; I talk about them in the next part of this chapter.
 
✓ SU Wiki (www.suwiki.org): This Web site is built by SketchUp users, 
for SketchUp users. It’s a gold mine of tutorials, tips and tricks, plugins, 
and other resources that I’m sure you’ll find useful.

417
 Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Discover Even More
Now Get Out Your Wallet
Really. These resources cost a bit of money, but they’re worth every penny:
 
✓ Bonnie Roskes’ books: Bonnie’s The SketchUp Book was the first one 
available, and now she has several new titles, including SketchUp 
books for kids. If you think you’d like to get another, bigger book about 
SketchUp (written with architects and other design pros in mind), check 
out Bonnie’s books at www.f1help.biz. (Notice the .biz suffix — .com 
takes you somewhere else.)
 
✓ School DVD: I mention School’s videos in the previous section, but 
School’s designers have also produced the world’s first SketchUp educa-
tional/training DVDs, which you can order from its Web site (www.go-
2-school.com). The production quality on these things is outstanding, 
and Mike and Alex (the School guys) do an amazing job of teaching 
SketchUp for both Windows and the Mac.
 
✓ Dennis Fukai’s books: One word: jaw-dropping detail (okay — three 
words). Dennis’s books are hard to describe. He’s written four of them, 
each is fully illustrated in SketchUp and each teaches a different subject. 
If you want to discover more about using SketchUp in building construc-
tion or more about construction itself, or you just want to be completely 
inspired by what you can do with SketchUp, have a look at these books. 
Search for his name on Amazon (www.amazon.com) or go to his com-
pany’s Web site, www.insitebuilders.com.
 
✓ SketchUp Pro training: If you think you might benefit from being able 
to spend a few hours with a real-live trainer and a handful of other 
SketchUp students, Google Authorized Training Centers might be just 
the thing. They’re located all over the world, so there might just be 
one near you. Check out this Web site for more information: http://
sketchup.google.com/training/atc.

SketchUp brings 3D to 
everybody! Find out how, and 
start creating 3D models today
Maybe you need to build 3D models for work, or maybe 
you’ve just always wanted to explore 3D modeling. Well, 
Google SketchUp was made for you, and here’s what 
you need to get up to speed right away. Learn to make 
buildings and other objects, print your models, export them 
to other programs (including Google Earth), create 3D 
animations, and more!  
•  Hit the ground running — set up SketchUp, learn about edges 
and faces, use inferences and guides, and build your first model 
•  Develop a workflow — set up basic end-to-end workflow for 
creating and sharing models with your friends, clients, and co-
workers
•  Beyond buildings — model non-boxy objects like terrain, simple 
characters, and household objects like furniture
•  Take a different view — spruce up your models with styles and 
shadows to add effects, make objects pop, and enhance realism
•  Create presentation documents — use LayOut in SketchUp Pro to 
add text, callouts, and images; draw with vector tools; and print 
models to scale
