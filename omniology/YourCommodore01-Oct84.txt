SLINKY
Slinky, the spring, was having tun hopping about when suddenly be come upon a pile
of coloured blocks, so he thought he'd ploy oround on them for a w
amazement he found that they chonged colour wheri he londed on them. Wowl But
unknown to him, the blocks belonged to the Wicked Wizard, who sent his friends
along to tease our poor hero. Slinky is a real lun package with ninety-nine levels,
amazing reward displays, a
charming characters as Dusty the dust cioud, Marge the magnet, Ralph the r
raindrop, and orenzo the chameleon hopper?
AZTEC CHALLENG
A challenge on on epic scale! Aztec Challenge
takes you on a journey to Mexico and the ancient
pyramid of Tenochtitlan. The ancient Aztec gods
and their devotees have ensured that no ordinary
human can learn the secrets of the temple and live
to tell the tale. The pyramid is protected by all
manner of treacherous traps and hidden perils, an epic test of your couroge
and cunning. Aztec Challenge features no less than seven totally different
screens - here are just three of them - each of which presents a brand new
challenge. We hope your joystick can stand up to it!

CONGRATULATIONS!
You have had th e  good
sense and judgment to pick
up a copy of the ﬁrst issue of
a GREAT n e w  magazine
dedicated t o  t h e  C o m -
modore range o f  micro-
computers. I f  y o u  h a ve
actually purchased this copy
and are now sitting in your
armchair at home you can
rest a s s u r e d  i n  t h e
knowledge th a t this a n d
future issues o f  Y o u r
Commodore w i l l  satisfy
your thirst for information,
games, serious software,
education, news a n d  a l l
sorts of goodies that are part
and parcel o f  th e  Com-
modore scene. O n  t h e
other hand i f you haven't
already parted with money
to buy this copy — Why not?
We can assure you here and
now that it will be money
well spent — you'll gain an
invaluable insight into your
Commodore m i c r o  a n d
what it can do for you!
What can we offer?
Assuming th a t yo u  have
spent a couple of minutes
ﬂicking t h r o u g h  t h i s
magazine and yo u  are still
not convinced that Your
Commodore i s  th e  best
thing since sliced silicon,
spend a little more time in
my company and let me try
to change your mind.
61t1IIVIENEr
Your Commodore will
entertain, i n f o r m  a n d
educate you on all matters 'a
la Commodore'. Each issue
will have regular news pages
to keep you informed of all
the latest products a n d
stories related t o  y o u r
computer; o u r  i n tre p i d
software reviewers will be
let loose each month on the
latest packages around and
let you in on their opinions
before you actually hand
over some cash; Runecaster
will be summoned from the
Crypt to advocate the spirit
of Adventure; and at least
one m aj o r p i ece o f
hardware will be reviewed
each issue.
Commodore a r e  n o t
exactly renowned fo r the
quality and clarity of their
manuals — we have series
and articles o n  program-
ming i n  both BASIC and
machine code to help you
write programs yourself and
to help you understand the
way o th e r programs are
written w h e th e r  you are a
beginner or expert there's
sure to be something here
for you to learn!
For the average home
computer u se r (although
we o f course accept that
Your Commodore readers
will b e  w e l l  a b o v e
'average'!), games occupy a
tremendous amount of the
time and energy spent on
the computer. Your Com-
modore will cater for the
games player, as evidenced
by our feature on games
programming o n  the VIC
and the fantastic games for
the VIC and Commodore 64
in this issue. However we
are trying not to go 'games-
mad' and we appreciate that
there are an awful lot (sorry,
not meant literally!) of users
out there in Commodore-
Land who have exhausted
their trigger ﬁngers a n d
crashed all their spaceships!
Seriously, though..
In Your Commodore w e
have put together a variety
of articles f o r  th e  more
serious-minded a m o n g s t
our readers: there are some
really useful routines that
are primarily intended for
the C o m m o d o r e  6 4 .
although they will run on
other Commodore micros
with a few alterations. The
business users o f  C o m-
modore micros have n o t
been forgotten, either. Each
issue of Your Commodore
will have a number of pages
devoted to this growing and
generally under-served
application area, — under
the highly original title of
'Down to Business'! As you
can see in this copy, we have
a review of the CBM 8296-D
and w e  take a  l o o k a t
how to  set about writing
your o w n  business-type
software.
Not only..
It would be true to say that
we could go on ad inﬁnitum
about the value, expertise
and entertainment that you
are going to get from Your
Commodore, but..
All you really need to
know is that i f you have a
Commodore micro (regard-
less o f which model) and
you want to keep informed
on the latest happenings in
the world of Commodore,
then just b u y, read and
inwardly d i g e s t  e a c h
fantastic issue o f  Y o u r
Commodore.
Now pay your money
and enter th e  fascinating
world of Your Commodore!
Passing thought
Grahame Davies, one of the
merry contributors to  this
ﬁrst action-packed issue
thought that the following
idea was worth passing on
why not link up your SX-
64 t o  your normal video
recorder? You can then use
your TV screen instead of
that tiny 5" screen, It works,
you know!
But wait.
Should you consider that
there i s  something y o u
would like to see i,n a future
issue of Your Commodore,
why not drop a line to the
Editor? We obviously put a
lot of blood, sweat and tears
into p u tti n g  together a
balanced magazine, b u t
why don't you let us have
your opinions? Write to the
Editor a t  t h e  Editorial

Machine code is the
lowest-level computer
language but it is also
the fastest. A P and D

some of its mysteries.
NEWCOMERS TO THE ART
must be forgiven for think-
ing that BASIC is somehow
the natural language of the
home o r  business micro-
computer. T h e  w ri tte n
information supplied with
machines, such as the Com-
modore 64 User Manual,
tend to give this impression.
BASIC is certainly the most
popular and the easier to
learn but it is a mistake to
think o f i t as the natural
language o f the Commo-
dore 64.
In fact, BASIC i s n o t
natural t o  any computer.
This honour is claimed by a
language, if indeed it can be
called a  tr u e  language,
known (loosely) as machine
code. The microprocessor
chip, which functions as the
central control o f a com-
puter, can only respond to
orders couched in machine
code. Even when we write a
program in BASIC, a com-
plex program, called a n
interpreter, i s working
feverishly i n  t h e  b a ck-
ground, converting each
line o f  the program into
machine code ready for the
attention o f the micropro-
cessor.
An obvious question
now arises —  i f machine
code i s  th e  natural lan-
guage of a computer, why
is BASIC so popular? The
question is best answered
by comparing their relative
advantages and disadvant-
ages.
•BASIC is easier to  learn,
to use, than machine code.

• Learning machine code
forces you to  understand
the inner workings o f  a
computer. However clever
you become with BASIC,
the computer itself will still
remain a  mysterious grey
box.
• Skill i n  machine code
tends to inspire awe at the
local c o m p u te r  c l u b .
(Whether this is considered
trivial o r  not depends on
your temperament.)
It i s  clear th a t machine
code scores on all counts
except simplicity.
How Hard Is Machine
Code?
We have said that machine
code is not simple, but this
does not necessarily mean
you will ﬁnd it particularly
hard. I t  requires just that
little more dedication and
patience than BASIC re -
quires, a different attitude
of mind and, above all, a
greater attention to detail.
The language i s  m o r e
abstract and code-like i n
form. The example below
illustrates t h e  code-like
form. It adds 3  and 5  to-
gether and stores the result
in a machine address.

written i n  assembly code
which is a superior type of
machine code. (The differ-
ence is explained later.) The
version on the right is the
same program but written in
pure machine co d e . I n
BASIC, the same effect can
be achieved with, say,
Z=3+5
You will have to understand
binary arithmetic, hexa-
decimal code, certain logical
operations and a few other
bits o f background know-
ledge. But none o f these
subjects need frighten you.
They are not hard to learn
and the rewards are well
worth the effort. However,
when y o u  d o  b e co me
proﬁcient, don't adopt a
snobbish attitude towards
BASIC. BASIC i s  a  nice
language and should not be
though of an a competitor
of machine code. In fact, the
aim of this series is directed
towards the amalgamation
of BASIC w i th  machine
code.

' P r o  r a m m i n g
Although i t  was stated
above that machine code is
much faster than BASIC, it
would be quite wrong to
attach t o o  much signiﬁ-
cance to  it. If a particular
program runs fast enough
written in BASIC, there is
little point in re-writing it in
machine code. On the other
hand, there may be certain
parts of a BASIC program
which run far too slow for
comfort.
For example, sorting a
long list of data into order
can take several minutes or,
in some cases, even hours in
BASIC. A  machine code
subroutine could achieve
the same result i n  a  few
seconds. Screen animation
effects are fa r  better i n
machine c o d e  th a n  i n
BASIC. The movements are
less jerky and the display
can b e  g i ve n  a  m o r e
professional appearance in
machine code. Robotics is
becoming popular w i t h
computer hobbyists a n d
machine code control of the
robot's private parts i s
virtually a  necessity —
BASIC is seldom fast enough.
Entering Machine
Code
There are two methods —
one is free but tiresome to
use and terribly error prone,
the other is pleasant to use
and far less error prone but
involves additional expend-
iture. The cheap method is
by using the keyword POKE
— we simply POKE every
machine code instruction
into memory, a byte at a
time. Trying to follow how a
'POKEd' machine c o d e
program works, or to debug
it i f  i t  doesn't work, i s
nothing short of sheer hell.
To compare the difference,
refer back t o  th e  short
example which added two
numbers together. The left
hand version, although still
code-like in form, will be
shown later to be far more
comprehensible th a n  th e
numeric mess on the right.
By using a  piece o f
software k n o w n  a s  a n
assembler, the task is much
easier, the machine code
listing is easy to  read o r
correct and you are relieved
of m uc h bor ing wor k .
Although th i s series will
cater for readers who are
zofdrool.

Hardware Knowledge
Required
If 'hardware knowledge'
means familiarity with elec-
tronics, then you may rest
assured yo u  need hardly
any. We shall, from time to
time, be mentioning 'volts'
but only i n  yes/no form.
That is to say, either a certain
voltage is present or is not
present. Computers happen
to be electronic in nature,
but, as far as programming
in machine code is con-
cerned, it wouldn't make all
that much difference if they
ran o n  N o rth  Sea gas.
However, you will have to
understand a little about the
overall system o f a  com-
puter, particularly the role
of t h e  microprocessor,
memory chips and a  few
other bits and pieces — not
how they work b u t what
they do. Figure 1 gives a
rough idea of how some of
the components are con-
nected i n  m o s t  mi cro -
computers. Th e  micrpro-
cessor looks a bit fearsome
at this stage but all should
become clear as the series
progresses.
Many readers will already
be aware of the distinction
between R AM chips and
ROM chips. ROM stands for
Read On l y  Memory and
refers t o  memory chips
which h o l d  permanent
information p u t there b y
the manufacturers. Inform-
ation in ROM is known as
ﬁrmware,
ROMs are said t o  b e
non-volatile, meaning that
the stored information i s
still there after the machine
is switched off. There are
three ROMs in the Com-
modore 64:
• The 8K operating system
ROM known as the kernal.
This i s a  program which
handles all th e  mundane
operations of the computer
such as reading the key-
board, displaying characters
on the screen and so on. It
occupies the range of hex
addresses between E000 and
FFFF (59344 to 65535 deci-
mal).
•  The 8K BASIC language
interpreter occupying th e
hex addresses A000 to BEEF
(40960 to 49151 decimal).
• The character generator
ROM, responsible fo r ar-
ranging the correct pattern
of screen dots fo r  every
character. There are tw o
separate sets of 256 charact-
ers: o n e  set covers th e
upper case and ﬁxed key-
board graphics, the other
set covers the normal upper
and lower case typewriter-
style characters.
RAM stands for Random
Access Memory, a n  u n -
fortunate t i t l e  because
ROM chips are also 'random
access'. The essential feat-
ure o f RAM chips is the
ability t o  re a d  existing
information and write new
information u n d e r co m-
puter control. Y o u  m a y
notice from Fig. 1 that the
control line, R/W, is con-
nected to  the RAM chips
but not the ROMs. This is
because R OMs a re  p e r-
manently in the 'read' state,
whereas R AMs mu st b e
switched to a different state
when information is to be
read from them when they
are to be written to. RAMs
are more like the old school
slate used i n  the Charles
Dickens era — old material
can be rubbed off and new
material written.
RAMs are volatile, Any
stored information is lost if
the power is interrupted,
even fo r  a  fraction o f  a
second. R AM is fo r your
use, although some of it is
hogged b y  th e  operating
system fo r  screen display
purposes, i n p u t/o u tp u t
control and, for want of a
better term, working space.
There is indeed 64K of
RAM present in the Com-
modore 64 but, unless some
ﬁddling around i s  done
(explained l a te r  i n  t h e
series) a n d  so me  R O M
facilities sacriﬁced, only 32K
is normally available to the
user. I t  i s  d i fﬁcu l t t o
proceed any further with
computer components o r
machine co d e  u n ti l  t h e
binary counting system is
explained together with the
hexadecimal notation.
Unfortunately, the mere
mention of binary is enough
to invoke a yawn from those

who already know it and a
gasp of fear from those who
don't.

The Binary Number
System
There a re  t w o  kinds o f
computing machines, th e
analogue kind (which is of
no interest whatsoever to
us) and the digital kind. So,
when w e  speak o f 'com-
puters', i t  i s  taken f o r
granted we are referring to
the digital kind. A computer
is essentially a  system o f
switches -  silent electronic
versions o f  th e  ordinary
household o n /o ff switch.
There are hardly any smo-
othly varying voltages.
Voltages, are either in the
HIGH state (about 5V) or the
LOW state (nearly ze ro
volts). Due to this essential
two-state nature o f  th e
computer, i t is natural to
base all arithmetic and other
forms o f processing on a
counting system which uses
only two characters. Binary
is such a system because it
only uses the characters 1
and 0 ,  allowing u s  t o
represent a HIGH voltage by
1 and a low voltage by O.
Any number, however
large, can be formed by a
string of l's and O's called
bits. Binary, like the familiar
decimal system, uses th e
normal place-weighting
system but, instead of each
place being worth 10 times
the value of the number on
its immediate right, it is only
worth twice as much. For
example 111 i n  binary is
read as one 1. one 2 and one
4 which, in decimal, is 7. To
help you get the feel o f
binary, study the following
binary numbers with their
decimal equivalents:
1111 =15
1010 = 10
1110 = 14
0011 = 3
Note that when there are
more than four bits, i t is
conventional t o  separate
them into groups o f four
because i t  i s  easier f o r
humans to read them that
way.

decimal
Since a  byte is the most
commonly encountered
number o f bits, i t follows
that there are 2  8  = 256
ways of arranging the bits —
there are 256 combinations.
Referring back to Fig. 1, you
will notice 16 address wires
coming out of the micro-
processor. We can deduce
from this that only 2 • 16 =
65,536 different address
combinations are possible.
Now 1K=1024, so there are

We poor humans need a
more co mp a ct w a y  o f
presenting large  binary
numbers. Well, the four-bit
groupings mentioned earlier
correspond t o  a  base-16
system of counting (since 2
=16). This counting system is
called hexadecimal; i f you
gain experience with th e
hexadecimal equivalents,
you would be able to say,
almost immediately, th a t
the above binary number is
DMA. Just a s base t w o
required only two types of
digit, 1  a n d  0 , so hexa-
decimal uses 16 characters,0
to 9 and the six letters, A to
F, to represent a group of
our bits. Th e  following
table shows the value o f

The last six patterns, which
have a decimal value of 10 to

letters A to F respectively.
Once these six extra patterns
are mastered (or memoris-
ed), it is easy to express a bit
pattern, however long and
fearsome-looking, in a few
hex characters. Remember
that each h e x  character
represents one nibble and

After glancing a t  th e
above h o rri b l e -l o o ki n g
jumble, it may be a relief to
learn that only occasionally
will it be necessary for you
to convert hex to decimal.
In fact, you will gradually
realise that decimal is alien
to machine code. I t  i s
actually easier and much
quicker, to  think i n  hex,
particularly if you do invest
in an assembler.
For example, in machine
code work, machine ad-
dresses are frequently in-
volved. In  hex, these ad-
dresses within th e  range
0000 to FFFF hex. In decimal,
the same range is0 to 65,535.
Decimal is clumsy and quite
unsuited to machine code;
hex is concise and tailor-
made for it. Memory loca-
tions are each o n e  byte
'wide' so the binary con-
tents can be expressed very
neatly by two hex characters.
The last address in memory
is M E  There is something
ﬁnal about FFFF but there is
nothing ﬁnal about 65,535!
It does take a little time
to get hex into your blood.
In the initial stages it comes
as a shock to discover that,
say 10 in hex is not ten i t  is
sixteen. Similarly, 32 in hex
is not thirty-two — it is ﬁfty.
In speech, don't s p

(10 x 16)+15=8623 decimal.
Hex FFFF=(15x4096)+(15x256)
+(15x16) + 15-5,535 decimal.
Binary Arithmetic
The p e n ci l  a n d  p a p e r
procedure for adding binary
is the same as for decimal,
providing you realise that a
carry to  the next digit is
worth 2  instead o f 10. For
example:

Adding Hex
Numbers
Some examples are given
below without explanation
as an exercise:
Users of BASIC are usually
unaware of the computer's
internal arithmetic. Numbers
of e n o rmo u s si ze  a r e
casually entered and th e
correct answers are taken
for granted. When we ﬁrst
take a look into machine
code arithmetic, the situ-
ation looks decidedly bleak.
The 6510 microprocessor is
only capable o f  handling
eight bits —  i n  fact, i t is
called an 'eight-bit' chip. If
all eight bits are binary l's,
the largest absolute number
it can handle is FF hex or 255
decimal. This may seem a
depressing start.
If b o th  positive a n d
negative numbers are to be
handled, th e  situation i s
even worse because one of
the bits is used to indicate
the sign of the number. This
reduces the maximum pos-
itive number to  only 127
decimal and the maximum
negative number to  -128.
However, things are not so
bad as the appear because,
as we shall see later in the
series, i t  i s  possible t o
increase t h e  ra n g e  o f
numbers b y  employing
some crafty programming
tricks.
Two's Complement
Notation
Two's complement notation
is employed i n  nearly all
computers for the following
reasons:
• I t  enables positive and
negative numbers t o  b e
handled i n  a n  efﬁcient
manner
• It simpliﬁes the hardware
concerned w i th  addition
and subtraction. On l y  a
circuit capable o f  adding
binary numbers is required;
subtraction is achieved by
adding the two's comple-
ment of the number.
The most signiﬁcant bit in
the byte, called the sign bit,
has th e  following signiﬁ-
cance:
The sign bitA), if the
number is positive, and 1 if
it is negative.
Examples of positive num-
bers a r e  g i v e n  u n d e r
the following table.
0000 1001 =  0 9  h e x + 9
decimal
0111 1111 = 7F hex = +127
decimal.
Negative numbers are not
so straightforward because
it is not just a question of
changing t h e  si g n  b i t .
Before we give the rule, try
and work it out by studying
the following examples:
0 0
0000 1010 = +10
0100 0000 = +64
1111 1111 = -1
1111 0110 = -10
1100 0000 = -64
then add 1 more. Ignore any
ﬁnal carry. For example:
0000 0011 = +3
Flip all the bits _11111100
Ndd 1  
1
1111 1101 = - 3
When we ﬂip all the bits, the
result is called th e  one's
complement b u t, adding
the ﬁnal 1, converts it to the
two's complement. T h e
process works both ways.
The rule still applies fo r
changing a negative number
back into positive. Try using
the rule to change -3 back
to +3.
To avoid adding the 1,
which may often involve the
propagation o f  a  carry,
there i s  a n  easier way.
Assume we start with the
positive number:
To obtain the two's
complement, start from
the right and copy down
up to, and including, the
ﬁrst 1. Thereafter, ﬂip the
remaining bits.
The ﬁrst rule we gave is the
academic version, the sec-
ond is the useful one — it is
easy to use. Sometimes, we
need t o  ﬁn d  t h e  two's
complement o f  a  h e x
number. The easiest way is
to write out the binary bits,
use the second rule and put
the result back into hex. For
example:
3F hex = 0011 1111.
Two's complement = 1100
0001=C1 hex.
This concludes Part 1 of
the series and most of the
boring background know-
ledge. W e  c o u l d  h a ve
skipped a lot of it but this
would o n l y have caused
trouble l a te r o n  i n  t h e
series. A  working know-
ledge of binary and hex is
essential for machine code
programming.
The t e r m  ' ﬂi p '  i n  t h e
following rule means change
and 'O's' and vice versa:
To ﬁn d  t h e  equivalent
negative, ﬂip all the bits and

BATTLE A T A K  I S  A
computerised version of the
popular game 'Battleships'.
It runs o n  the  standard
Commodore 64 in no more
than 10K of memory and
uses user-deﬁned graphics.
The scenario is as fol-
lows: you are in command
of a  submarine equipped
with torpedoes and a battle
computer. Your task is to
defend your ﬂeet of surface
ships with your torpedoes
and destroy t he  enemy
ﬂeet before their torpedoes
wipe y ou out. Y ou a r e
shown your ships on one
grid and where your shots
hit on the other. Unfortun-
ately you are unable t o
determine the locations of
the enemy vessels, so the
second grid starts off blank
at the  beginning o f  the
game. B ot h ﬂeets a r e
identical and consist of the
following:
1 Aircraft ( 4  squares)
Carrier
2 Battleships ( 3  squares)
3 Submarines (3 squares)
4 Cruisers ( 2  squares)
The ﬁgure stated after the
ship is  t he  number o f
squares which it occupies
on the grid.
The computer marks up
on the grid any develop-
ments as the game progres-
ses and the game will ﬁnish
when either side's ﬂeet has
been completely destroyed.
When you r un t h e
program
You will ﬁrst be shown a title
page whilst the computer
E 1 0 loads in the user-deﬁned
graphics into its memory. To
proceed, press the Space
bar when told and you will
be asked for a skill level and
then speed level. Level 1 is
the easiest game, a nd
beyond level 6 the computer
BATTLE
will automatically have
another shot if it hits a ship.
As far as speed levels are
concerned, 1' is the fastest
and '5' the slowest — this
governs the length of time
between each shot.
Once you have entered
the desired levels, the grids
will be displayed. But be-
fore the game can com-
mence, you have to place
the ships o n  your grid
which i s  l e f t  o f  t h e
coordinates i n  the  com-
puter, three characters must
be entered. The ﬁrst is the
letter f o r  t h e  distance
across, and the others for
the ﬁgure for the distance
down —  for example, the
coordinate for the top left-
hand corner would b e
'MO1'.
So, to enter a ship on the
grid you type the coordin-
ate where you want the
bow of the ship to appear,
and you then must say if you
want the ship to be facing

converts m a c h i l l =
code into BASIC"
for those of you with
obI
WHILE I WAS WRITING THE
renumber program else-
where in this issue it became
necessary to create a BASIC
listing fro m  a n  area o f
memory as a list of DATA
statements. Also I was doing
some work with character
generators at the time so I
also needed a program that
could read th e  character
generator R O M  a s  w e l l
(very difﬁcult).
The result is a program
that asks you for the start
line number of the result-
ing p ro g ra m a n d  t h e
increment between t h e
lines. Program lines w i l l
then begin to ﬂash on the
screen. After a  while the
program will end and the
original program will be a
lot longer. If you specify a
start line number that the
program already uses it will
overwrite the program and
will irrecoverably crash.
The start location for the
code t o  b e  converted is
stored in line 20 (currently
49152) the end location is

now be deleted, and a long

containing t h e  code. A
POKEr can be put as the ﬁrst
line to POKE in the DATA

and hey presto there you
have it.

chips, all need appropriate
activating keywords.
The more sophisticated
the translator, the bigger
the ROM. The software in a
big ROM costs more and,
what i s  more important,
uses u p  m o r e  o f  t h e
addressable space o f  th e
computer. For example, the
CBM 6 4  uses a  6510A
microprocessor. I n  c o m -
mon with most other eight-
bit microprocessors, only 16
address wires are available,
limiting t h e  number o f
directly addressable mem-
ory locations, including
both RAM and ROM, to
2A16 6 4 K .  Apparently,
CBM considered R A M
space more important than
ROM sophistication so they
decided to  cut down the
BASIC interpreter ROM to
BK. Many would say this is a
pity. I t  i s inevitable that
penny pinching in this area
has led top a rather stingy
dialect of BASIC. The best
that can be said for it is that it
is just adequate.
These gentle (?) criticisms
should n o t  b e  taken t o
heart. Complex program-
ming p ro j e cts c a n  b e
undertaken whatever BASIC
dialect is resident in ROM
providing we work just a bit
harder and be a little more
methodical when we write
programs.
Programming
Guide Lines
If the CBM 64 is your ﬁrst
machine, a n d  y o u  have
ironed out the last remain-
ing b u g  i n  y o u r  ﬁr s t
program then, by all means,
feel elated. But don't let the
elation last too long. The
fact that a program works
should be considered the
ﬁrst, rather than the last,
step. In all probability, the
listing will be fouled by scar
tissue resulting from multi-
ple alterations and insert-
ions. In all probability, there
will be redundant lines and
evidence o f excessive zeal
in the use of GOTOs.
It may be argued that,
providing a program works,
why bottler with niceties?
Your ﬁrst program was
probably short and niceities
won't have mattered very
much. Th e  trouble starts
when y o u r  conﬁdence
increases and you have an
urge to tackle more ambit-
ious projects. If you carry
on in the original undisci-
plined manner y o u  w i l l
soon regret it. The bug-hunt
ing stage becomes more
and m o r e  hideous. Th e
process of curing one bug
often leads to the introduct-
ion o f  t w o  mo re . Th e
outcome, a fte r hours o r
even weeks o f work, can
end i n  bouts o f  verbal
obscenities or, even worse,
lead to  permanent change
in the personality.
The answer to all this is to
start out on the right lines.
Try and make the listing
beautiful as well as funct-
ional. It is too early in the
series to start laying down
the precise rules o f pro-
gramming structure but„ in
the meantime, you would
do well to take notice of the
guide lines which follow.
Use Of Remarks
Use R EMs liberally. I t
is o f t e n  t h o u g h t  t h a t
remarks a r e  f o r  t h e
beneﬁt o f  o th e r people
trying t o  decipher h o w
your program works. This is
only partially true. They are
more o f  a n  a i d  t o  th e
programmer. Never rely on
memory for understanding
the purpose of a routine. It
may b e  perfectly clear at
the time of writing, but even
a few hours afterwards, you
may not be quite so certain
how it worked or, in some
cases, even what i t  was
supposed to do! REMs use
up memory but this doesn't
matter in the slightest when
you are developing a pro-
gram. When i t  i s  ﬁnally
ﬁnished, the original copy
can be kept in its REMmed
state and a copy, naked of
REMs, kept as a workhorse.
Preliminary diagrams
Scribble out a rough dia-
gram, showing the order in
which the various parts of
the program a r e  t o  b e
carried o u t. The type o f
diagram is unimportant to
start with. There are things
called 'ﬂow charts' and 'top
down stru ctu re  ch a rts'
which use established sym-
bolism b u t  there i s  n o
urgent need to  learn, o r
even stick to them. Provid-
ing you understand your
own diagram, that is all that
matters. Too much estab-
lishment guidance applied
too early can crucify en-
thusiam and destroy init-
iative.
Variable names
Decide careful on variable
names a n d  w r i te  t h e m
down a s  a  list. U n fo rt-
unately, CBM BASIC only
allows t w o  ch a ra cte rs
for a  variable name, th e
ﬁrst o f  which mu st b e
an u p p e r  ca se  l e t t e r
and the second a letter or
one of the numbers 0 to 9.
Some BASICs a l l o w  a n
unlimited number of char-
acters in a variable name so
it is easy to  choose them
meaningfully. For example,
INPUT-VOLTAGE is mean-
ingful b u t o n  the 64 w e
would have to be content
with, say, IV instead.
Because of this restrict-
ion, i t  p a ys t o  sp e n d
some time on the choice of
variable names. Although
only t w o  characters a re
allowed, the law of combin-
ations allows you choose
any one o f 936 combinat-
ions. This can easily b e
demonstrated: t h e  ﬁr s t
character must be a letter,
so there are 26 ways o f
choosing one. The second
character can be a letter or a
numeric ﬁgure so there are
36 ways of choosing it. The
number o f ways in which
two characters c a n  b e
chosen is therefore 26 x 36 =
936 combinations.
Sometimes, i t  will b e
necessary to  use a name
without any meaning (no
mnemonic value) in order
to a vo i d  clashing w i t h
another name. However,
whatever names you give
them, the most important
thing is to write them down
ﬁrst and stick to them like
glue. I f  you neglect this
discipline, programming
time will squandered b y
having to continually scroll
back the listing to see if you
have used the name before.
Giving the same name to
(what sh o u l d  b e )  t w o
different variables can cause
distress to the programmer
and pleasure to  malicious
computer.
Modular
construction
As far as possible, try and
arrange your program as a
set o f self-contained sub-_
routines, each capable o
separate testing outside the
program. Th i s i s  some-
times di fﬁcul t b u t  w i l l
pay d i vi d e n d s i n  t h e
long term. if the subroutine
requires some values norm-
ally obtained from another
part of the program (as it
probably will) then write a
short trigger program which
hands over test numbers,
entered from the keyboard.
When eventually, you per-
suade it to pass this test, it
can safely be inserted in the
program w i th  th e  know-
ledge that, whatever else is
wrong in the ﬁnal version
that particular subroutine is
beyond suspicion. In  this
way, your program grows as
a coherent structure o f
tested building bricks. (The
technical term is modules.)
:

The hated GOTO
Go easy on the GOTOs. The
most violent criticism o f
BASIC h a s always been
directed against the over-
use of the GOTO keyword.
The GOTO is a jump to a
line number: for example,
GOTO 560 then, a few lines
later, G O T O  1200. T o o
much of this is called 'spag-
hetti programming'. It can
be absolute hell to follow if
carried to  excess. GOTOs
can never be avoided in 64
BASIC but, with a little care,
their population ca n  b e
decimated.
In any case, don't even
think o f jumping out of a
loop with a GOTO before
the normal exit. This is the
worst crime i n the book,
even i f the program does
work. (There are one or two
exceptions to this but this is
not th e  proper ti me  t o
discuss them.)
Screen messages
However brilliant the pro-
gram its effect on the user
will depend ultimately on
the quality of the screen dis-
play. There is only one thing
worse than a scruffy display
and that is one that is over-
embellished. Messages t o
the operator should be as
short as possible but not at
the expense o f  clarity.
Extremes should be avoid-
ed. For example, a message
such as "AGE?" is certainly
short b u t i t  may n o t b e
immediately obvious that it
is an invitation to input your
age a t  t h e  k e y  board.
Staccato messages o f  this
kind often lead to a situation
in which screen and user
stare at each other blankly,
each waiting for the other to
do something.
On t h e  o th e r h a n d ,
"Would you be kind enough
to supply the computer with
information as to your age
and then press RETURN" is
an example o f the other
extreme a n d  l i a b l e  t o
induce projectile vomiting
all over the poor keyboard
The CUM has a liberal
E a s s o r t m e n t  of graphic keys
and th e re  i s  a  natural
temptation i n  t h e  early
stages t o  ta r t u p  every
message with a  coloured
border of circles, squares or
asterisks. Over enthusiasm
in this respect can reduce
the impact of the message
by swamping i t  with th e
kaleidoscopic beauty (?) of
the border.
Programming
philosophy
Always p r o g r a m  w i t h
the idea that the ﬁnished
product will, in the light of
experience, require modi-
ﬁcations or additions. This
attitude will drive you to
plan the program in module
form. It will also provide the
incentive to include plenty
of REMs and, most import-
ant of all, it will teach you to
cut down on the GOTOs
and to keep a register of the
variables used. In short, it
will help you to write good
programs -  not just ones
that work.
Finding And
Curing Bugs
To start with bug ﬁnding
before w e  have treated
programming in detail may
seem like putting the cart
before the horse but i t is
based on sound psycholo-
gical reasoning. Program-
ming is unlike any other
discipline because i t  d e -
mands a strange mixture of
skills. Attempts to quantify
the mixture will inevitably
invite argument, b u t fo r
what it's worth, program-
ming is 70% science, 30% art.
Imagination i s  a l so  a n
important ingredient pro-
sense
all,
viding it is
strong
But, above
mer must always
guard against the evils o f
frustration. It is ridiculously
easy t o  b e  frustrated,
particularly i n  t h e  early
stage o f  learning. T h e
following adage (w h i ch
should n o t be taken to o
literally) may prove com-
forting!
supported
of

method.
a program-
be o n
1. No program works
ﬁrst time.
2. If it does, it was too
simple anyway.
There are tw o  classes o f
bug:
• Programming e r r o r s
which are unacceptable to
the computer. These are
relatively easy t o  c u r e
because t h e  co mp u te r
outputs a  screen message
indicating the nature of the
crime. A full list of the error
messages are given on pages
151/152 of the Commodore
User Manual.
• Programming e r r o r s
which the computer accepts
but cause the program to
behave o th e r  th a n  t h e
intended behaviour. These
bugs are more serious and
could take a long time to
ﬁnd.
The most common bug
in the ﬁrst group is due to
the use of incorrect gram-
mar. The computer oblig-
ingly informs the user than a
"SYNTAX ERROR" has been
discovered. Th e  offence
could b e  caused b y  a n
incorrectly spelt keyword,
wrong punctuation, u n -
recognisable k e y w o r d ,
bracket (parenthesis) mis-
sing or one more than there
should be, or the incorrect
use of arithmetic operators.
With regard t o  brackets,
remember t h e r e  m u s t
always b e  a n  e v e n
number of them. An incor-
rect arithmetic operator can
be more difﬁcult to locate,
particularly if the question is
at all complex.
The most common error
is l i ke l y t o  arise o v e r
multiplication. Wh e n  w e
write Z  = XY i n  ordinary
mathematical notation, it is
implied that X and Y are to
be multiplied together. The
computer does not respond
to implications. It wants to
know exactly, by using a s
the multiplication operator,
so we must write Z = X*Y.
It should be mentioned
here that failure to include
the asterix in this example
would not necessarily result
in a syntax error because Z=
XY is recognised as valid
syntax. It will be interpreted
as a simple assignment, in
which the variable named
XY is to be assigned to the
variable named Z .  T h e
example provides a  good
illustration o f  the second
type of bug. That is to say,
the computer accepts it as a
valid o rd e r b u t, i f  t h e
programmer intended mul-
tiplication, the result would
be quite different to  that
intended. This kind of error
can take some spotting until
you get used to arithmetic
operators.
While on this subject, it
is w o rth  discussing t h e
concept o f operator prec-
edence. Page 114 o f  th e
Commodore User Manual
gives the order o f prece-
dence in which arithmetical
operations are carried out.
For example:
V1 = 3+8*5A2 will make
V1 = 203
V1 = 3+8A 2/2 will make V1
= 35
When you are learning, it is
safer to forget precedence
and rely on parentheses to
indicate the order in which
the arithmetic i s  t o  b e
applied. The two previous
examples would b e  safer
written,
V1 = 3+(8*(5A 2))
V2 = 348 A 2)12
Although parentheses are
safer for the inexperienced,
they do increase translation
time so, in programs where
execution time is critical, it
is b e tte r  t o  re ve rt t o
precedence.
Syntax errors a re  r e -
sponsible for much o f the
early frustration, mainly
because humans are n o t
used to  dealing with such
fussy animals. It takes some
time to come to terms with
such unaccustomed intol-
erence. Just RUN and re-
RUN the program, pegging
away at each offending line,
until th e  program event-
ually reaches the last line
number and then stops. The
frustration should then be
replaced by a warm glow of
pride.

I

Our intrepid reviewer,
Sue Dufﬁeld, was very
impressed with this
artistic program.
WELL, COULD A  C OM -
puler te a ch  m e  w h a t
nearly t e n  y e a r s  o f
schooling couldn't, namely
to paint? Could it and how!
Move over Renoir — here
comes Paintpic.
Paintpic is a  complete
painting a n d  d r a w i n g
system developed b y  the
New Zealand co mp a n y
Kiwisoft in conjunction with
Kuma Computers.
Claimed by the makers
to be capable of producing
outstanding re su l ts, I
dutifully worked through
the 5 8 - p a g e  m a n u a l
provided to see if I could.
Thankfully th e  manual i s
very deﬁnitely written i n
layman's terms —  i t even
tells you how to  load the
cassette which is a boon for
the simple-minded. I t
gently takes the user step by
step through the basics of
the p r o g r a m ,  a l w a y s
working b y  example and
you quickly reach the point
where you actually start to
paint.
The quick load (seven
minutes) and the question
and answer type entry bring
you s tr a i g h t i n t o  t h e
drawing mode.
And there you are —
Turner's seascapes, C o n -
stable's landscapes or even
Picasso's madness — all at
your ﬁngertips.
The details
So how does it work?
When th e  program i s
Toaded, a crosshair appears
on the TV screen. You begin
to paint b y  moving this
across the screen using a
joystick o r  a  series o f
desgnated keys. A  trail o f
minute dots follow which-
ever direction you choose
to g o  i n ; left, right, u p ,
down, and even diagonal.
Three painting methods are
available, pen, brush or text
mode.
Using th e  p e n  mo d e
there a re  around 32,000
dots i n  th e  painting area
S o f t w a r e  R e v i e w
ARTISTIC
STUFF
from which you make up
your pictures. This means
your painting can be both
intricate and delicate but at
the same time i t is both
painstaking and slow — not
recommended f o r  t h e
slapdash among you.
The brush mode means
you can colour large areas
of the screen quickly and
tHere a r e  i n d i vi d u a l l y
deﬁnable b ri stl e s a n d
brushes which you can store
and retrieve at will.
The text mode is, as the
name suggests, simply the
ability to reproduce on the
screen a n y o f  th e  keys,
letters, ﬁgures and symbols,
accessed t h r o u g h  t h e
keyboard.
You paint in four colours
at any given time, chosen
from the full colour range of
the Commodore 64.
Once you start to paint,
if you make a mistake or
change y o u r  mi n d , y o u
don't have t o  wipe th e
*
screen clean and start again.
Erasing is simply a matter of
retracing your steps using a
different c o l o u r . W h o
knows h o w  Va n  Gogh's
paintings w o u l d  h a v e
turned out if he'd had this
facility?
You can also take all the
hard work out o f moving
the crosshair round a n d
round th e  screen as you
paint because there are nine
home positions, accessible
by a single key stroke, which
take away the necessity of
going over and over the
same area to get to where
you want to be.
A little practice and in no
time a t  a l l  y o u ' l l  b e
producing results to  stun
your friends. And you don't
need to  lose the master-
piece when you switch the
TV off and go to bed. You
can save all or part of your
painting o n  t a p e  a n d
retrieve it when you want.
The manual a l s o  gives
detailed instructions o n
how t o  photograph your
efforts direct from the TV so
you can keep them forever.
Very young children can
play happily at this game,
using the joystick. with no
mess or washing up and few
tears.
Adults can get equally
hooked c r e a t i n g  a n d
recreating at little cost to
either pocket o r  temper.
Even professional artists,
claim the manual, can use
the system t o  produce
accurate publishable visual
work.
Truly versatile, totally
addictive and just fascin-
ating, this is one of the best
'games' I've played fo r a
long time.
Paintpic is for the CBM
64, is priced at €19.95
and comes from Kuma
Computers.

Can you outguess the
machine? Derek
Waldron's
programmed a CHM
64 version of this
popular game.
THE P R O G R A M  I S  A
version of the popular type
of code-breaking game. It is
a game for two players who
take the roles of  'code-
setter' and 'codebreaker.
In my version for the Com-
modore, the computer is
given the role of codesetter,
leaving you t he task o f
cracking the code.
The code consists o f
four colours from a choice
of eight. Not only do you
have to guess which colours
have been used, but you
also have t o  determine
where each colour has been
placed within the code. To
help you reach this goal, the
computer will mark each
guess t hat  y ou make,
according to the following
rules: for each colour and
position guessed correctly,
a black 'peg' wi l l  b e
awarded. Where a colour is
guessed correctly, but the
position does not match
that in the code, a white
'peg' will be awarded. A
mark o f  4  black 'pegs'
therefore means you have
cracked the code!
In view of this assistance,
you are only allowed 10
attempts in which to break
the code. If, after this time,
you have been unsuccessful
in y our attempts, t he
computer will reveal to you
what the code was.
To enter your guess, keys
1
colour chosen is pressed, a
square on the grid will be
ﬁlled with the appropriate
colour, working left to right
as each colour is entered. It
E
colour has been entered it
cannot b e  deleted, s o
careful thought should be
given before entering any
colour.
Once the fourth colour
has been entered, t he
computer will wil automatically
CODE
BREAKER
assess your guess and print
the appropriate mark in the
answer box alongside the
line you have entered. The
answer will be in the form of
black and/or white 'pegs' in
accordance with the rules
already speciﬁed. Please
note that the position of any
black or white 'pegs' in the
answer bears no relation to
the position of the colours
in your guess. This means
that a black 'peg' in the left-
most position of the answer
does not necessarily mean
that the left most colour of
your guess is the one that is
right.
Watch Out
The relevant points t o
watch o r  in each answer
given by the computer are
the number of 'pegs' and
their colours.
If any of your guesses are
totally unsuccessful, ob-
viously n o  pegs will be
awarded in the marking,
which will be backed up by
an unpleasant noise. Do not
be disheartened. You will
come t o  learn that an
unsuccessful guess will
often giv e y our m ore
information than one re-
warded with, say, one or
two 'pegs'.
The scope for using sound
within a program of this
nature is limited, and has
been restricted t o  t he
already mentioned 'rude
noise' for an unsuccessful
guess, together with differ-
ent pitched notes for black
and white 'pegs', when
marked. When you are able
to crack the code within the
10 guesses allowed, you will
also hear a short, familiar
tune.

structions to play the game

Mike Roberts has
come to the rescue of
tangled line numbers
with this great
!renumbering utility
for the CBM 64.
COMMODORE BASIC IS
lacking in a great deal o f
functions. Graphics co m-
mands h a ve  b e e n  w e l l
documented a n d  m o s t
magazines have published
programs th a t d o  hi-res,
sprites, sound etc
Utilities tend to be a bit
thin o n  t h e  ground a s
everybody's e ffo rts a r e
directed against th e  gra-
phics. While using Super-
soft's 'Mikro' assembler I
suddenly needed a  r e -
number program, The fol-
lowing machine code pro-
gram was the result. As I
only use it for renumbering
assembler programs I ' m
afraid that there is no facility
for renumbering GOTOs
GOSUBs etc as this would
make th e  program quite
long and complex.
As it stands it is just as
good as the renumber pro-
gram i n  C o mmo d o re 's
Simon's BASIC cartridge.
Setting Great Store
To explain how the program
works it is ﬁrst necessary to
go into detail about how
BASIC stores a program line.
The ﬁrst byte in a program
line is zero (not the last byte
as most people seem t o
think), the next two bytes
contain the address of the
start o f the next program
line, This is called the link
address and is used by the
interpreter only while run-
ning a program and insert-
ing a new line. The next pair
of bytes is the pair that we're
interested i n  -  th e  line
number. A f t e r  t h e  l i n e
number is the rest o f the
E
The l i n e  n u mb e r i s
stored as a  16 bit binary
unsigned integer, so it can
be from 0 to 65535. So for a
renumber program all we
have to do is scan through
the program picking out the

Of course th e re  a re
some options. Y o u  ca n
dictate the line number that
the program starts with and
the difference between
them. This is done by POKE-
ing four bytes into the 64's
memory:
POKE 2 4 8 , INT(X/256):
P0KE247,X--(INT(X/256)*
256)
This will set the start number
for the program where 'X'
should be replaced by the
number that you want the
program to start with.
POKE250,INT(Y/256): POKE
2
256)
This will set set the differ-
ence between th e  lines,
where 'Y' should be replac-
ed by the increment.
The machine c o d e
should then be called with
'SYS 49152', after a  short
pause the program will be
renumbered. The POKED
values will be preserved, so
you only have to POKE them
the ﬁrst time, the next time
they will still be there and
you just need t o  d o  the
SYS call.

This 64 utility from
Mike Roberts will d i
eally speed up y o u .
'lane system.
6 4  U t i l i t y
1
THE COMMODORE TAPE
system is notoriously slow.
So i s  th e  disc drive fo r
various reasons. This leaves
the Commodore 64 owner
with a  b i t o f a  problem.
However, if you could ﬁnd a
program on a tape faster it
would s o l v e  a  l o t  o f
problems.
First on
My program is designed to
be recorded a s th e  ﬁrst
program o n  a  tape. The
procedure when wanting to
load a program is to rewind
the tape to the beginning,
load and run the directory
program b u t, and this is
important, DO NOT PRESS
THE STOP/ EJECT BUTTON.
When the program runs it
will ask you what ﬁle you
want, and whether you are
going to save to it or load
from i t .  Next comes the
important bit — you must
hold down the PLAY key
and press down the F/FWD
key a t th e  same time so
that they are both down
at once, n o w  yo u  must
hold d o w n  t h e  F/FWD
key and press the STOP/
EJECT key. The end result of
all this manoeuvering is a
silent tape recorder and a
depressed F/FIND key.
Now if you merrily press
the Return button, the tape
recorder will magically start
to make a whizzing sound.
After a number of seconds,
depending o n  which ﬁle
you want, the tape recorder
will s to p  a n d  y o u  c a n
proceed as normal.
This system w i l l  ﬁn d
programs on tape a lot faster
than any normal method.
But wait...
There a r e  o n e  o r  t w o
E
 restrictions though:
The tape must be blank
when y o u  start t o  save
programs on i t, you can't
just tack the catalogue on
the beginning of a tape of
programs and hope it will
ﬁnd them. Th e  program

expects th e  programs a t
evenly spaced intervals,
that's h o w  i t  works. The
program is currently set up
for 10 ﬁles of about 8K each
on a  C60 cassette. These
parameters can b e  easily
changed to  suit your own
tastes.
The number of programs
on the tape is stored in a

This must be equalled by the
following number of DATA

ments are padded out with
spaces so that if you add a

list and re-record it at the
beginning of the tape it will

The length of the sectors

This i s  a n  invaluable

it on the PET, VIC, and now
the '64 for about the past
ﬁve years.

SHADES OF BATTLE ZONE
this one! Confronted with a
3-D plain (yes, it is 3-D), you
hear the aliens approach-
ing. Diamond shaped, fast
moving aliens which don't
tire at ﬁrst, appear and are
easy prey. Then, if you have
the sound up on your TV,
you will hear at times a low
humming noise. This i s
when your shooting accura-
cy counts. The noise signi-
ﬁes that there is a suicidal
alien missle coming towards
you. One shot is enough but
it's getting that one shot that
is the problem.
Once you despatch the
aliens a  d o o r o r  vortex
opens on the screen. When
you travel through i t you
will have to steer round a
star ﬁeld making sure you
don't h i t anything. When
you accomplish this minor
(!) task another door opens
onto the second level. This
level is a little harder than
the ﬁrst w i th  th e  aliens
shooting back and aliens
which explode on their
own.

The graphics are jerky,

Loading is quite simple. It is
an addictive game and very
quick. The action is fast and
it gets faster as the game
progresses. It's a pity there
are no skill levels. There are
other good points espec-
ially the feeling you have
when you have outrun the
guided missiles. The scoring
is very simple, 50 for a large
and small truck, 100 for a
tank and 250 for a missile
launcher. The key choice is
good and joystick response
is also good. This i s  a
brilliant idea fo r a game,
however it's a great pity that
it was not thought out more
constructively. Overall a fast

HAVING SEEN VARIOUS

attempts a t  t h e  g a m e

honest, n o t succeeding, I
was quite surprised a n d
excited a t  seei ng  t h i s
version.
Simply, it is even better
than th e  original arcade
machine game (yes, i t's
possible). To start with, the
quality of graphics used in
this game surpasses all other
imitations. Th e  game se-
quences are kept as close to
the original as possible with
two exceptions.
The ﬁrst is that when
playing you will notice some
musical notes scattered on
the ﬂoor of the landscape.
Shoot these and the music is
turned on or off, This is a
good idea, since the only
drawback i s having "Star
Wars" playing in the back-
ground. This spoils t h e
sound effects.
The second deviation
from the original is screen 3.
This screen contains mobile
tanks that shoot at an angle.
and it's quite difﬁcult to ﬁre
at them and maintain a good
supply of fuel.
It is as hard, if not harder,
than th e  original but the
only high score feature is
when you're playing. It's
deﬁnitely well worth th e
money as it is an example of
State of the Arts game. I look
forward t o  more projects
from N i g e l  Rowlan o f
Rabbit Software.
TRIAD COMES IN A Bo x
containing n o  e n d  o f
instructions, feature listings
and pictures of the game. I
couldn't wait to  grab my
joystick and start 'playing.
On the box it said there was
"3D t o t a l  p e rsp e cti ve
g r a p h i c s ", " S m o o t h
multicolour graphics, music
and sound effects" etc, etc.
The game itself took a
long time to load but I could
wait! The description of the
game was that the galactic

display a  portion o f  th e
total maze.
When you ﬁght with the
Maziacs you will ﬁnd that
you lose your sword if you
kill it. This isn't a problem as
long as there i s a  spare
sword lying about, which
there usually is. If there isn't
then you may have to ﬁght
with your bare hands and
then you stand a chance of
losing your life.
It is worth paying atten-
tion to the graphics in the
ﬁght because o f the intri-
cate detail that has been put
in. It is a good game with no
two mazes the same.

could travel. Unfortunately,
the Triads kept on attacking

job, ﬁrstly, to clear a patrol

quality of the game, one of
the prime advantages is the
use of a fast loading system
which loads in less than two
minutes. There's nothing
worse than hanging around

game is to ﬂy your spaceship

for ages waiting for a game
to l o a d ! B u t  I  digress.
Despite a partial similarity in
the initial stages to  those
frustrating 'frogger' games,
Horace Goes Skiing is an
enjoyable and skilful game.
The objective of the game is
to g e t th a t cheeky little

avoiding th e  juggernauts,
cars and motorbikes and
into the shed on the other
side to pick up his skis. To
reach the ski slopes of the
Hannekon run you have to
get Horace back across the
road which gets busier as
time passes. What happens
Few basic zapping games
seem t o  have the lasting
appeal of good old fashion-
ed Space Invaders. How-
ever, as a variation on the
theme, Metroblitz will have
you instantly hooked and as
a piece o f  arcade action
should have you practising
in your sleep.
You are the sole defend-
er of the metropolis which is
under attack fr o m  wave

intent on destroying the city
below you. Your space ship
is in perpetual motion and
you have t o  prove your
prowess b y  dodging b e -

obliterating them with your
superior ﬁre power before
they destroy all the build-
ings.

13 you enter the advanced
stage and that's when they

games and bad silly games.
The trouble is that I can't
decide which this one is. It is
very su b j e cti ve  a s  t o
whether you like violent or
non-violent games. Bath-
time is a non-violent game,
which has reasonably good
graphics and sound.
The main feature is its
large use of sprite graphics
including an elephant, a boy
in swimming trunks, tw o
heavenly c h e r u b s ,  a
goldﬁsh and a  swan. The
game itself has an inter-
esting concept, as follows:
The ﬁsh and swan are having
a bath and controlling the
ﬂow of water are the two
cherubs; they, being you
and another player, or the
computer. I t  appears that
the game that really counts
and that's where Gridtrap
falls down miserably.
Despite some lengthy
instructions, th e  game a t
ﬁrst seems like a hopelessly
overcrowded mess with a
hideous musical accom-
paniment. It takes a while to
fully realise what the hell is
going on.
The object of the game is
to manoeuvre a character

Player one has to either let
the bath ﬂood so that the
swan sails away or let the
bath run dry and kill the ﬁsh.
Player two has to  prevent
this by monitoring the water
ﬂow. There is a time limit on
each game played so as to

To make things a little

ledge, t o  reach th e  exit
above you. The 'power' of
your jump is controlled by
how long yo u  h o l d  th e
to escape!" We now come
to an ambiguous bit! The
word adventure t o  most
computer owners implies
that the user has to solve an
adventure —  n o t so, the
book works its way carefully
through examples of PRINT,
INPUT and String handling
and in the last two pages of
the story our intrepid D r
Watson j u r y  r i g s  a
spaceship's controls — with
no r e f e r e n c e  t o  o u r
previous e xa mp l e s o f
computer programming —
and sets it in motion. Not
qute what we expected!
Third: " T h i s  u n i q u e
adventure i s  specially
designed t o  teach t h e
fundamentals of '64 BASIC
by way o f example — the
way children learn best,"
Well., perhaps so b u t  for
the u s e  o f  t h a t  w o r d
'adventure' again.
Fourth: "Accompanying
this is a tape containing the
same programs as are on the
spaceship's computer, and
some B ON U S  teaching
joystick left (or right) before
centreing the stick — then
you jump. It takes a little
while to  get the hang o f
judging how much power
to put into a jump, in order
not t o  o v e r s h o o t o r
undershoot your target. Just
to add to the excitement —
there i s  a  ﬁerce dragon
roving around the cavern,
ready and willing to gobble
you up! You have only one
life and having lost that (I
did, w i t h  mo n o to n o u s
regularity!), yo u  have t o
wait through the 18 seconds
programs so your children
can learn as they play."
OUCH! Yes there are three
simple programs that are
referred to in the book —
very short but yes in the
book! We  then have two
copies o f  a  'Hangman'
program — a little old hat
but I maintain that one can
have a lot of fun with these
sort o f guessing games —
BUT with a total vocabulary
of four (4) words? AND one
of those is CBM — not exac-
tly inspiring, it also makes
one wonder about who is
kidding whom at the price
of 0.95.
Having turned the tape
over and LOADed the ﬁrst
program, we are presented
with a menu. This lists the
programs on this side of the
tape a n d  o n  selecting
option 'x' you are given a
very brief resume of what
you will learn. ..then there is
a 'Message from Dr Watson'
— this turns out to be pages
of errata from the book!
With my package there was
'intro' as Booga-boo falls
into the cavern once again.
Time elapsed, Level and
Hi Score are indicated at the
bottom of the screen. Level
is the height you are at,
above t h e  ﬂo o r  o f  th e
cavern. Hi Score does not
indicate u n ti l  y o u  have
escaped the cavern, so no
matter h o w  l o n g  y o u
manage t o  e va d e  t h e
dragon, o r  how high you
climb, you have no personal
best score to strive for in the
early stages. .1  could have
done with a little something
no indication that this was
there — not even a cheap
slit of paper..
The teaching programs
request the user to type in
the co rre ct fo r m a t f o r
PRINTing various examples
— followed b y  similar
exercises on String handling
and use of Line Numbers —
quite a nice idea and well
though out...except ...with
a teaching program such as
this one does not expect to
be a b l e  t o  'crash' t h e
programs if given a wrong
answer O K ,  I tried to do it
but.-
Fifth: "E v e r y  BASIC
command covered is also
given a  separate careful
explanation in the second
part of the book..." Yes it is
.except fo r the errata
mentioned a b o v e , i t ' s
passable.
In conclusion, all I can
say i s . . w a i t  f o r  M r
Holmes's book — he always

just wish it was a bit easier at

one of the menu options is

commendable project, es-

guess it was written using a

not the easiest to read, even

potential members o f the
Strawberry Jam Preservation
Society. The object of Solat,
amongst other things, is to
prevent th e  hero, Zippy,
from b e i n g  thoroughly
pulverised o r , more col-
loquially speaking, turned
into strawberry jam.
To all intents and pur-
poses. Splat is a variation on
the age old theme o f the
maze game. Comparisons
can be drawn with Pacman,
the illustrious ancestor of all
maze games, although it can
you are faced with a  56
strong squadron of bi-plane
lighters ( th e  year being
1919). Easy you think, and
easy it is, for these pilots do
not stand a chance against
your gleaming 1984 ﬁghter.
All that is left to do on that
screen is to tackle a single
Zeppelin w h i c h  co me s
ﬂoating across your screen,
but be careful because it can
release a nasty little salvo of
bullets when you are not
expecting it. Once you have
cleared the screen, you are
transported to another time
— 1940. Again, you must
despatch a large number of
aircraft. But they are getting
a bit more nasty.
Clear that screen and
be a bit misleading. How-
ever, if the truth be known,
it is just as addictive.
The m a i n  difference
between Splat and other
maze games is that the main
character, Zippy which you
control, is not being chased
by an nasties, at least none
that I've managed to  dis-
cover. Zippy has plenty of
freedom o f  mo ve me n t
within th e  boundaries o f
the maze which is much
larger th a n  t h e  visible
playing area a n d  slides
around unpredicably intent
on splattering Zippy.
The purpose of the game
is t o  explore th e  maze,
scoring points by gobbling
up grass, plums and u n -
stable thingermejigs which
have a habit of turning the
tables on Zippy. There are
seven skill levels in all and
you have to race against the
you are launched into 1970
where y o u  m e e t  h e l i -
copters. This is the turning
point of the game. As you
clear that screen you are
transported into 1990! The
aircraft are more advanced
than yours, so you have to
play more tactically instead
of just ﬂying into them and
shooting.
Finally, if you clear that
screen you meet from the
year 2001, Flying Saucers!
Unfortunately I didn't clear
that screen b u t  I  d i e d
valiantly!
This game in general has
good graphics using sprites;
the sound has a few effects
but not too much to write
home about. With the time

trouble l o n g  enough t o
reach the next level.
The main obstacle t o
avoid are the spikes which

cause Zippy can't swim and
the sides of the playing area.
There are also things called
alternative Zippys which
could be good, bad or just
plain ugly but my failure to
progress beyond level ﬁve
has failed to  reveal them.
The l a ck o f  a n y  useful
instructions doesn't h e l p
matters much either.
The great thing about
Splat is that reasonable skill
levels are quickly achieved
and it has a perfect frustra-
tion factor which makes you
keep plugging away at the
high score.
One thing that might
help, but I'm not quite sure
should exist, is slow motion
movement when the pause
facility is on. Not only will it
help calm your nerves but
can a l so  h e l p  y o u  g e t

Fancy having a go at
wrilint your own
arcade type game?
William Fong has tried
to give you some d i
guidelines to start you
on the way.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
you played a new computer
game and after minutes (or
sometimes hour s !) o f
frustrated playing you are
sure that you could have
written a  far better game
yourself? It is really not as
difﬁcult as you might think
provided you approach the
task in the correct fashion —
and you can get a great deal
of enjoyment from t he
program writing itself, let
alone when you can happily
play wit h t h e  ﬁnished
product!
The ﬁrst move
Naturally your ﬁrst move is
to think of the basic idea for
the game. O f  course the
idea should be an original
one — try to break away
from the same old mould of
alien-zapping, m a z e -
wandering a nd monster-
killing! No doubt this is the
most difﬁcult part of writing
a good game.
Now don't immediately
rush off to your computer —
well n o t  y e t  anyway!
Transfer your idea to paper
— there's nothing worse
than spending hours at the
keyboard only to ﬁnd that
the game falters at a crucial
time t h i s  is a ﬁne recipe to
make you give up on the
idea before you've given
yourself a ﬁghting chance.
Think everything out before
you ge t too carried away:
what sort of characters will
be involved? Are you going
E
a particularly unusual way?
What will signify the ending
of the game? Do you want a
two-player facility? These
and so many other factors
will be vitally important to
establish before y ou g o
YOUR OWN
ARCADE
GAME Illko
headlong into typing actual
code.
Throwing down the
gauntlet
Bear in mind that the game
should be challenging to be
even the most skilful player.
This does not mean that the
game should be impossible
to beat — people will easily
lose interest i n  a  game
where they haven't got even
the faintest chance o f
winning! A way of getting
round this problem could
be the use of different levels
of difﬁculty. Above all keep
the concept simple — too
many r u l e s  c a n  b e
confusing, and they should
remain the same through-
out the game.
Most people prefer a
joystick-operated game, but
it is wise to keep all your
options open. If you have
not got a joystick and are
forced to use the keyboard,
please give some thought to
the choice of control keys so
that the player does not
have t o  perform super-
human digital antics i n
order to ﬁre a missile!

touching the computer. A
lot of thought is needed to
make the game interesting
and addictive — this is often
the s t a g e  a t  w h i c h
programmers d o n 't apply
too much care and the small
but important touches are
left out. In good games the
screen is always changing
and the graphics are usually
moving. A t this stage you
can let your imagination run
riot when thinking o f the
representation o f  t h e
main characters in the game
and here you can use the
CBM 64's graphics abilities
to the full. But don't worry if
you ﬁnd it difﬁcult — there
are many graphics design
packages around fo r  th e
CBM 64.
Colour use is also very
important and is probably
best added after everything
else has been completed.
Generally colour should be
used t o  mi n i mi se  t h e
player's frustration; critical
features and anything that's
urgent should stand o u t
clearly, whereas features
that are not viewed often
should be lightly coloured.
Be careful with the colours
of adjacent characters as the
eye i s  easily fooled b y
contrasts; try also to avoid
ﬁlling the screen outside the
playing area as this can be
distracting and confusing. It
is also o fte n  w o rth  t h e
trouble to  try playing the
game on a mono screen —
different colours d o  n o t
always distinguish them-
selves on a black and white
TV,
Listening in
Sound effects should be
considered c a r e fu l l y ;
certainly w i t h  t h e  64's
complicated S I D  c h i p
excellent sound effects may
be generated. Good use of
sound can enhance a game
and turn it into something
really special, b u t  i t  i s
perhaps one o f the most'
difﬁcult things to perfect. It
must suggest impending
action to the beginner but
not antagonise the advan-
ced player; i t  i s  w o rth
leaving i n  t h e  o p ti o n
of tu r n i n g  t h e  s o u n d
off. Trial and er r or  is the
only way to perfect different
sounds for each character or
piece o f action —  a long,
low fr e q u e n c y  s o u n d
suggests sl o w  movement
but you need a short distinct
sound for more immediate
action.
Try to make your sounds
as pleasing as possible and
try to  avoid shifting from
low to high frequencies too
abruptly. If you are a little
more expert in the musical
ﬁeld you could have a go at
writing a little tune to go at
the beginning of the game
or running throughout it.
Don't forget though that a
catchy l i ttl e  tu n e  heard
multitudinous times while
you're trying to  beat the
computer can sometimes
make you want to beat the
composer instead!
Other factors
Don't forget that through-
out t h e  writing o f  th i s
wondrous game you will
need to keep track of where
the characters are at any one
time —  w a s t h e  alien
destroyed a n d  therefore
now out o f the game, o r
have you merely blasted it
into another position in the
maze? T h e r e ' s  s u r e l y
nothing worse than having
e xp e rtl y d e s tr o y e d  a
submarine only to ﬁnd that
minutes l a t e r  i t  h a s
mysteriously come back to
life a n d  suddenly blown
your ship to smithereens!
A scoring strategy i s
purely a matter of personal
preference, although i t
certainly appears that many
people like a  High-Score
record facility. You must
also decide whether to have
a time limit on the game —
will you ru n  o u t o f fuel,
missiles or oxygen?
Game point
Well, that's all there is to it! I
know i t  seems a  totally
daunting task, b u t  re st
assured (?) that the hardest
game you will ever have to
write will undoubtedly be
your ﬁrst. As you go through
the routine for the ﬁrst time
you will gradually learn nifty
little movement routines,
exciting explosion effects
and more, and often you
will ﬁnd that they ﬁt i n
better t o  yo u r Ma rk I I I
version o f the game which
has all sorts of reﬁnements
added t o  t h e  original.
Throughout the process of
writing your own game you
must continually test each
new stage you add on —
who knows how that new
routine will affect the part
you have already perfected?
It is also advisable to always
keep back-up copies fo r
those odd occasions when
the whole thing crashes —
you may not always have the
stamina o r memory to  go
back and start a t the
beginning again!

*craft in William
Fong's simulation for
the d m
FOR MA N Y YEARS THE
French and British airways
have been discussing how
to speed up travel and at last
they have designed a new
Concorde; Concorde I
This should be  far better
than the original Concorde
as it travels much faster and
is more economical to run.
Being a 'professional' pilot
yourself y ou have been
given the chance to have
the ﬁrst test ﬂight. Your
route is to Glasgow from
Heathrow. The journey is
not as easy as it seems as
there a r e  quite  a  f e w
instruments to watch and
the level you pick will have
to depend on the weather
conditions y o u  w i l l
encounter. T h e  ﬂa ps ,
undercarriage, s pe e d,
altitude, deviation readout
and artiﬁcial horizon are all
important instruments t o
watch.
How to ﬂy
When you take off make
sure your ﬂaps are down or
the plane will not go up!
When your ﬂaps are down
your speed must not exceed
280 mph or you will damage
your ﬂaps. Your undercar-
riage (wheels) must b e
taken up before the speed
reaches 300mph or they will
be damaged. However, the
undercarriage m us t b e
down before the aircraft is
below 300ft. If your ﬂaps are
up the plane speed must not
drop below 210mph.
The distance between
the two airports is about 380
miles and because this is a
real-time based simulation
it will take a long time if you
keep the speed at 500mph.
Ei4 G a m e
The aim of this test ﬂight is
to see how fast you can get
to the other airport : speed
approx 1700 mph.
The artiﬁcial horizon is
an important instrument
and it comes in very handy
when visibility drops t o
zero. The deviation readout
should be updated often as
the pointer is in line with the
approaching runway, so try
and keep the pointer near
zero. The map readout on
the British Isles is useful as it
indicates how far you are
from Glasgow (if you know
where Glasgow is).
Where ne a r ing t h e
runway o r  a n y  ot he r
unknown information the
control tower will report to
you. When going in to land
the speed must be about 200
mph and the altitude less
NCORDE
than 601t. The ﬂaps must be
down and the  undercar-
riage must also be down.
When you are above the
runway drop your speed to
10mph and altitude to about
213ft then you will get d
perfect landing.
Controls
To turn push joystick in port
two and turn as normal.
To increase altitude pull the
joystick back
To nose dive push the
joystick forward and the
plane will dive down
To lower your undercar-
riage use Function key 3
To raise your undercarriage
use Fl
To lower ﬂaps use F 5
To raise ﬂaps use F 7
To drop altitude without the
plane diving use
To drop speed use
To increase speed use the
Fire button on the joystick.
Watch out
The runway is only 1.3 miles
long so make sure you take
off before you reach the
end of the runway. When
you see the other runway
drop your altitude to about
50ft or you will ﬂy over it and
all effort would have been
wasted.
The game may sound
easy to complete but wait
until you are in the cockpit.
There are levels you choos
to increase the difﬁculty,
storm, engine failure, strong
wids, a n d  m a ny  othe r
conditions. Good luck, and
happy landings.!

Worlds
WHAT IS AN ADVENTURE
program? Today we look on
adventures as part of our
everday (computer) lives.
They come in all shapes and
sizes for all the different
computers we can buy —
where did they start? Many
of us today, especially those
reading this, own a personal
home computer. Just a few
years ago they did not exist
— hard to believe, isn't it?
Five or six years ago, the
options were severely limit-
ed — PETs, TRS-80s, build-
your-own, a memory cap-
acity standard of about 8K,
some 16K or 32K perhaps, if
you were rich. Those were
the days when computers
and computer talk were
still t h e  closely-guarded
'hi-tech' secret of
just a  f e w people w h o
would go t o almost any
length t o  promote, n o t
knowledge, but bafﬂement
and confusion to those who
were not 'signed on the line'
members of that close-knit
club.
Gone, but...
Fortunately those days
are past, not long in time,
but dead, dead, dead. The
home computer has come
of age — young but strong
enough to walk on its own.
But .  .  .  one thing those
mainframe freaks did have
that we can thank them for
being unable t o keep to
themselves was adventure,
or more properly, Advent-
ure. For, among the dim
corridors of ﬁnance, med-
ical statistics, research into
this and that, was t o be
found (often illicitly), Ad-
venture. The time was just
right for its birth: Dungeons
and Dragons was already
coverting more and more to
46 it s  banner -  a game (or way
of life) where you, ordinary
mortal, could enter a world
so different yet so real, that
your life could depend on
you knowing the right spell
or your being adept a t
TALES FROM
THE CRYPT
hearing the very fabric of a
simple chest whispering to
you that i t  contained a
dozen pois on a r r ows ,
primed a n d  r e a dy  f o r
action.
Into this environment
came Adventure, written (I
believe) by Messrs Crowther
and Woods around 1978.
What was it? Adventure was
a new sort of game (life?)
where you could enter an
amazing world v ia  your
computer terminal — many
of them did not even have a
VDU. So that meant huddl-
ing ov e r  some sort o f
'teletype' to see the answer
to your simple instruction
of GO SOUTH. This 'world'
within the computer was
like no board game where
you can see quite clearly
)
where you will 'land i f you
throw a '6'. All you knew
was the direction in which
you could move — some-
times not even that! What
was in that direction, you
knew not. You had to ex-
plore y our  surroundings
and gradually build up a
map of them. I'm sure that
one of the most important
attractions is this freedom

Back t o  Ad ve n tu re .
There were many passages
to explore, logical puzzles
to solve and treasure to ﬁnd.
Adventure caught on like
no other game before or
since. Research scientists
and computer operators,
designers and programmers
spent (wasted?) hours trying
to get past the Troll! Unlike
many o f  t h e  successful
arcade games which fade
into history after months,
Adventure has stood th e
test o f  time. Ma n y p ro -
grammers have tri e d  t o
copy or improve upon it —a
few have succeeded, b u t
only a few.
We have moved to  an
age th a t expects p re tty

play a part in the adven-
ture. Mostly the graphics

be 'sold' to  the public —
some distributors ( a n d
much of what is in your local
store is determined by the
distributors) will not even
take adventures unless they
have those magic, 'selling'
graphics!
Graphics take up mem-
ory that could otherwise be
used to make the program
more interesting and pre-
sent you with more o f a

computer. The device plugs
into the back of a computer
using e i th e r  t h e  e d g e

modem is a lead with the
new style telephone jack.
This plugs i n to  t h e  B T

Micronet
Micronet is run like a daily

being the best way to keep
track of what is happening
in the world of computers
(apart from buying maga-
zines produced b y  yours

technical enquiry facilities
and programs to download,

Micronet is a kind of gossip
column, spouting rumors
and statistics. Viewfax is a
less fo r m a l  ve rsi o n  o f
Micronet offering many
similar services but with a
ﬂavour of its own. Access to

Into business
There are many business
orientated networks; most
of them require an eighty
column display and so are
not really suitable. They
also te n d  t o  b e  rather
expensive. T h e  m a i n
system, w h i c h  w i l l  b e
available to Commodore 64
owners is British Telecom

when it was broke into on
the BBC television program-

safer n o w .  G o l d  i s  a

used t o  send long letters

users, you can store as much
information as you like but
pay f o r  t h e  amount o f
memory this takes up. The
system is only really useful if
you log in regularly or want
to send information that is
difﬁcult to  read over the
phone, l i k e  legal d o cu -
ments or programs.
Latest bulletin
You don't have to have a
huge mainframe to  run a
database, there are many
micros doing a similar job.
These are called bulletin
boards (BBs). They usually
run on a Tandy computer
and are free. Most BBs use a
slow rate o f data transfer
and are not compatible with
the system used by Prestel;
this m e a n s  t h a t  o n l y
modems which are capable
of changing the speed at
which they operate (known
as a Baud rate) can 'talk' to
these systems. W i t h  t h e
increasing popularity o f
Prestel more and more BBs
are switching to the system
that Prestel u se s. T h e
advantage o f a BB is that
whatever you send in is put
up instantly, everyone is an
information provider. The
disadvantage i s  that only
one person can use th e
system a t  a  ti me . T h e
popular BBs can b e  very
difﬁcult to get through to,
they are usually engaged.
BBs are only local and it is
necessary to  dial th e  site
where the computer is set
up.
Getting switched on
Bigger computers usually go
through a switching system;
the main one is PSS. This
covers most of the country
and is a kind of motorway
for data: you dial a  local
number o n  t h e  g ri d  ( a
node), e n te r a n  identi-
ﬁcation number, a password
and who you want to talk to
and th e  system puts you
through. Th i s service i s
pretty c h e a p , d a t a  i s
charged for per packet ( a
number o f  bytes) and i s
much m o r e  economical
than calling direct l o n g
distance, especially when
dealing with other coun-
tries. PSS requires t h e
person you want to talk to to
also be on the system.
Compunet

great amount of security to
the system and it is hoped
that holidays, fu l l  home-

Commodore 64, with which
I h a ve  n o  complaints.
However, I  d o  h a ve  a
problem w i t h  program-
ming. The problem is to do
with the symbols which are
contained i n  s o  m a n y
programs for the 64, ﬁn d  it
hard t o  distinguish t h e
symbols from the printed
sheet and I have very little
understanding o f  these
symbols a n d  th e i r exact
meaning. I  w o u l d  b e
grateful i f you could give
me some tips on making the
symbols clearer and also the
titles o f any books which
will explain the symbols a
little more clearly than the
Commodore 64 Handbook.
Yours faithfully,

confusing, especially when
getting confused with ASCII
codes, screen codes and
BASIC codes.To help with
this, the best book to buy
would be the Programmer s
Reference Guide which will
help you with all aspects of
programming on the CBM
64. The only other method is
to persevere and delibe-
rately use the symbols in
your programs so that you
will forcibly learn them an
understand them.
Dear Sir,
I do not understand how to
use machine code on my
VIC 20. Please could you
show me a small machine
code program where I can
hit Return after every line
and type RUN at the end. In
books I  see long lists o f
letters, symbols, numbers
and spaces which, when
entered, give the message

Dear Sir,
I have a Commodore WC 20
and would like to expand it
to its maximum. I  already
have two 16K and a 3K RAM
Packs and a  Stack 4  slot
switchable mother board.
1) How can 1 use the
second 16K RAM Pack to
expand beyond the 19K that
get with one RAM Pack in
place, 2) Do you think that
since there are few i f any
programs for a 32K VIC that
am wasting my time and
money in buying extras, and
3)45hould I sell one of the
16K RAM Packs and buy a
32K RAM?
Yours faithfully,
A Ruff

We answer,
Do not buy the 32K ram
pack as you do not need it
and also because plug-into
extras l i k e  a d ve n tu re
cartridges, machine code
monitors and so on cannot
be used with it. To make full
use o f  your packs, open
them up and inside will be
banks of switches or solder
blocks depending on how
old they are. The pins are
numbered from 1 - 22. On
one pack, make pins 10 and
11 and on the other pack
make pins 12 and 13.
Dear Sir,
I have a VIC 20 on which
have been writing programs
since last June; i n  t h e

usually use user-deﬁned

have received a 16K RAM
pack which now gives me
19.5K o f  usable memory.
The problem is that I can't
use m y  u s e r - d e ﬁn e d
graphics in the way that
used to.
eg,
10 POKE 52,29:POKE 56,29
20 FOR T=7432 TO 7463:
READ A:POKEt,A:NEXT
30 POKE 36869,255
40 DATA etc. . .
which deﬁnes four chara-
cters starting at screen code
33.
On t h e  paper which
comes with the RAM pack it
states that -
to move the VC  screen or
character set into external
memory". Can you help me
by publishing a  program
which allows o u  to desi n  a
character set on the internal
memory with a 16K RAM
Pack ﬁtted and putting the
UDGs on the screen?
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir
have just purchased a CBM

Dear Sir,
want to ask you if the VIC
20 games are usable on the
CBM 64; can you send me a
list o f the games that are
usable? I  have read that
some people were going to
expand their VIC 20 up to
32K, but I have also read in
the Beginners' Handbook
that the VIC 20 is 5K and
expandable to  29K not to
32K! Can you clarify the
situation?
Yours faithfully,
Alex Koon

We answer,
No VIC 20 games other than
simple non-graphic games
will run on the CBM 64. You
can expand your VIC up to
38K w i th  23.5K available
from Basic. Y o u  cannot
expand the CBM 64 and this
machine has 16K of ROM.
Dear Sir,
Having owned a CBM 64 for
some m o n t h s  n o w ,
wonder i f you could help
with a number of problems I
have encountered: 1) How
can 1  g e t th e  computer

? 2) The operator's manual
says that yo u  can deﬁne
strings t o  256 characters.
When I try entering these, I
get a "Syntax error i f  press

typed more than two lines
of text. 3) Is there a simple
way of using the 8 function
keys in a program written in
BASIC or can they only be
deﬁned in machine code?

We answer,
Printing numbers t o  tw o
decimal places is a common
problem but there is an easy
solution. Firstly we need a
function t o  round o f f  a
number. This means that
1.554 becomes 1.55 a n d
1.555 becomes 1.56. Here is
the function (deﬁne it near
the start of your program):
10 deffnro(z)=int(z-k1004-.5)
/100
Now here is a subroutine
which will format numbers
to t w o  decimal places
(adding a '-' sign at the start
if it is negative). Note that
the format string that this
subroutine returns (a$) is
always the same length (10
characters) so that a list of
numbers w i l l  always b e
neat.
You can only deﬁne strings
to 255 characters. If you are
typing a  string i n to  th e
c o m p u te r  y o u  m u s t
remember that when th e
computer inputs from the
screen, i t only inputs two
adjoining l i n e s  o f  4 0
characters each. So i f you
were typing a long string
into a line then when you
had ﬁnished the computer
would look at the last two
lines and n o t ﬁnd a  line
number and would there-
fore produce ?syntax error.
The w a y t o  create long
strings is by concatenation
— adding strings together.
Each of the function keys
has an ASCII value so if you
wrote a program using the
GET command and pressed
one of these keys, the ASCII
value of that key would be
returned. The keys are not
deﬁnable from BASIC.
Dear Sir,
I own a Commodore VIC 20
and have recently received
a Commodore 1541 disc
drive with which I seem to
be having some problems.
After I have run some of my
programs I've found that
when I  give th e  drive a
command it comes up with
"Device not present error";
but the drive is connected
and is switched on. To get
the drive working again I
have t o  R u n  Sto p  a n d
Restore the computer and
then give the command:
OPEN 15,8,15,"I
start for the drive). It must
be so me th i n g  i n  t h e
program t h a t  somehow
switches t h e  d ri ve  o ff.
Could you please tell me
what i t  i s  a n d  h o w  t o
overcome it? Also can you
expand the buffer so that
you have mo re  than 1 0
characters - if so, how? Any
help w o u l d  b e  greatly
appreciated.
Yours faithfully

We answer,
To solve your problems with
the drive, you must send the

drive a 'uk' or l e  command
ie open 1,8,15,"uk":closel.
This must be done when
you ﬁrst switch i t on and
every time the drive is reset.
The command tells t h e
drive what speed to run it at
either for a VIC 20 or for a
CBM 64.
The keyboard b u ffe r
may not be safely extended
on the VIC 20 or the CBM

Dear Sir,
I a m  writing a  project
program fo r  my 'A ' level
computer studies exam.
However, a  difﬁculty has
arisen which I  would be
grateful for some help with.
My program runs o n  a
Commodore PET 4032. I
require a program allowing
me t o  r u n  a n d  p r i n t
graphics, eg bar charts, on
the PET 4032 compatible
printer. This screen dump is
essential for my program. I
urgently require a listing of
a suitable screen dump on
the PET 4032.
Yours faithfully,

We answer,
Information o n  a  C o m-
modore screen is stored in
screen code. This means
that i f you poke a screen
location with zero an @will
appear —  coincedentally
this is the same as chr$(0). If
you poke a screen location
with 1 an 'a' will appear but
chr$(1) i s  a  reverse ( o r
control) 'a' and this would
send yo u r printer i n  t o
enhanced m o d e .  T h i s
subroutine ca n  b e  co n -
verted to run on any of the
Commodore ma ch i n e s
printing to  a Commodore
dot ma tri x printer. Th e
listing here is for a 4032:
10 nc=40:nr=25:rem n u -
mber of columns : number
of rows
20 sc=32768 :rem memory
location of start of screen
30 open4,4
40 for i = 1 to nr-1 : a$=!'" :
for j 1  to nc-1
50 a = peek( sc+i•Ornc+j) :b = 0
60 i f  a  a n d  1 2 8  th e n
aS=a$4-chr$(18) :  a = a and
127: b=1
70 if a 3 2  then a = a or 64 :
goto 90
80 if a>63 then a = a or 128
90 a$ = aSchr$(a): if b then
aS = akhr$(146)
100 next : printE4,a$ : next
close 4
As you can see, the program
is quite straight forward and
can b e  easily coded into
machine code if required.

have fully exploited t he
colour, sound and graphics
potential of the VIC 20.
The ﬁrst two games, You
Draw a nd Noughts a nd
Crosses, may be adapted for
use on disc based systems.
All the games are introduced
by a brief synopsis of what
should happen if you enter
the program code correctly
and by descriptions of the
program structure. The
game listings conclude the
chapters.
The games vary from the

the Las Vegas of 1965 where
your target is to break the

Less philistine readers

states that there is no need

This great series
introduces you to tha
delights of program-
ming games for the
VIC in BASIC. Bryn
Phillips takes us
jhrough the steps.
THIS IS THE FIRST OF A FIVE
part series of BASIC games
programming fo r the VIC
20. The series is primarily
intended for newcomers to
games programming, b u t
there might well be a few
useful ti p s f o r  seasoned
programmers.
Many people are put off
writing action games i n
BASIC because they think
that it is too slow, and have
read somewhere o r other
that any good game must be
written in Machine Code.
That's true up to a point. A
badly written fu l l  scren
version o f Space Invaders
written in BASIC could be
really painful. Semi-coma-
tose Aliens jerking down

inspiring. O n  t h e  o th e r
hand a well written Lunar
Lander or Shooting Gallery
game could rival many o f
the commercial products. In
fact i t  would b e  better,
because it would be YOUR
game with your own amaz-
ing graphics a n d  sound
effects, and that is what it's
all about.
In th i s  series I  w i l l
attempt to show you some
of the techniques which you
can use to  write effective
games programs in BASIC,
and if you follow it through
and use your imagination
you should even be able to
do something about that
Space Invaders game!

on the screen display, and

enjoyable aspects of writing
a program. It's a good place
to sta rt because speed
doesn't matter t h e  action
doesn't start until you've set
up your play area. The key
point is to  get i t looking
good, and that takes plan-
ning. One way of doing this
is to draw it out on paper
ﬁrst. Graph paper is OK. but
don't fo rg e t y o u r  ﬁn a l
screen d i sp l a y w i l l  b e
rectangular. The only pro-
blem with using paper is
that i t  is time consuming
and discourages experi-
mentation. Once you've got
something w h i ch  l o o ks
reasonable you tend to stick
with it, and you're immed-
iately off to a bad start. It's
much better t o  use th e
screen to  experiment, and
the utility program "SCRE-
EN DESIGNER included in
this article will help you to
do this. It's worth noting at
this point that the VIC 20 has
an extremely well thought
out graphics set built into it.
Unfortunately there i s  a
great temptation to  forget
this and always use your
own user deﬁned graphics
(we'll be covering this in
Part 4). But don't ignore it —
even i f you use your own
graphic characters you can
always incorporate some of
the standard graphics into
your own set. When you use
this program pay particular
attention t o  th e  colours.
Often an otherwise good
program is ruined by murky
graphics. This is because
some of the character and
screen colour combinations
just don't mix very well, to
the extent that some are
virtually undecipherable. It

varies fro m  computer t o
computer and your TV can
also make a difference. Play
about w i th  th e  graphics,
make some shapes, design a
screen — EXPERIMENT!
The program
So now you've got a screen
design and want to put it in
your program. There are
two options in BASIC on the
VIC 20, PRINTing or POKE-
ing. Let's look at a simple
screen display, such as the
one in ﬁg. (1).
You can either PRINT it
or POKE it onto the screen.
PRINTing is the tempting
option as you simply write a
number o f  PRINT state-
ments containing the design.
This is shown in Listing 1,
In contrast POKEing a
design onto the screen takes
a b i t more thought. You
have to deﬁne your screen
co-ordinates and use the
appropriate POKE fo rm-
ulae. The simplest method is
to regard th e  screen i n
terms o f X,Y co-ordinates
and deﬁne the bottom left
hand corner a s 0,0. T o
POKE a character onto the
screen use:
POKE F10-X-221c Y,CH
and to POKE a colour use:
POKE P2+X-22-ArY,CL
Where P1=8164
P2=38884
Listing 2  gives a n  e x -
ample o f how the screen
design can be POKEd onto
the screen.
At ﬁrst sight PRINTing is
better as it's much faster.
Wait a  mi n u te  though,
speed doesn't matter here.
What about memory? If you
look a t the free memory
displayed you will see that
Listing 1 only left 2929 Bytes
free, whereas Listing 2 left
3262 Bytes free, a saving of
233 Bytes, and that could be
crucial later o n . I f  y o u

see that i t could be tight-
ened u p  even further by
using multiple statement
lines, GOSUBs etc, and this
is shown in Listing 3 where a

If yo u 're  writing games
programs o n  a n  u n e x-
panded VIC 20, tight prog-
ramming is essential. Admit-
tedly the listings don't look
so good, the program can
be difﬁcult to follow and de-
bug, but you leave yourself
enough memory over fo r
the game and with any luck
will have enough left over
for all those frills that make
it look professional — High
score record, menu option,
keybordijoystick capability
and o f  course the sound
effects. As you will see in a
future article ti g h t p r o -
gramming also means spe-
edier action, and it really is
worth taking the time to
plan ahead, and to practice
squeezing everything down
as far as you can.
Random thoughts
Finally let's have a look at
the RND function. Often it
can be used to  very good
effect in screen design and
in a multi-level game can be
used to  add variety as the
game progresses. You can
use it to change character

useful in maze designs. A
simple example is shown in
Listing 4.
Type in the program and
RUN it. The program simply
draws a  black boundary
around t h e  screen, a n d
randomly POKEs red squar-
es onto the screen. Now
comes the important part
Sit back a n d  watch th e
screen. A t this point i t is
possible that you will just
see squares appearing and
disappearing. If this is the
case you need to try harder.
Relax, and look again. I t
could b e  th e  start o f  a
meteor storm scenario, or a
devilish hyper-galactic
maze, or moles appearing
and disappearing i n  your
garden! Remember, we'll
be able t o  make those
squares look like anything,
and you can change the
ratio o f squares to blanks,
mix colours, add extra char-
acters etc. It could be the
basis of a good game. We'll
have another look at it next
month.
Next time...
In the next part of this series
we'll be looking at getting
the characters moving,
using programmed co m-
mands, and keyboard o r
joystick interaction. In other
words we'll get it all moving.
Screen designer
This program will allow you
to experiment with screen
designs. O n  running th e
program you will be presen-
ted w i th  a  blank screen
containing a ﬂashing cursor
which you can move around
the screen using the cursor
controls. If you press a key
then the appropriate chara-
cer will be entered on the
screen elsewhere the cursor
goes. You can use the full
VIC character set, including
reversed characters. If you
want a  reversed character
press CTRL/RVS, and the
next character entered from
the keyboard will be rever-
sed. You can change th
colour o f the character
pressing Ft followed by the
appropriate colour key, and
similarly change the border

Sprites
A sprite is a form of user
deﬁned character th a t i s
controlled b y  a  powerful
video chip called the 6566.
Up t o  8  sprites can b e
displayed a t  a  t i m e
automatically. More sprites
can b e  displayed using
Raster Interrupt techniques.

7. Sprite t o  background

A sprite is larger than a
character, therefore more
data is needed to deﬁne the
shape of a sprite. A sprite is
24 pixels (3 bytes) wide and
21 pixels high which gives us
a total of 3 x 21 -= 63 bytes of
data to deﬁne the shape of a
single sprite. Even though a
single sprite is made up of 50
M E I  I N
much data, the video chip
moves the sprite as if it were
a single character.
Sprite Pointers
The 64 byte blocks of data
that deﬁne th e  shape o f
each sprite can be placed in
any 6 4  byte multiple o f
unused memory. In order to
tell the video chip where in
memory each sprite-shape
block is located, eight sprite
pointers are provided.
The shape of a sprite may
be changed by adjusting the
sprite pointer allocated to
that sprite t o  point t o  a
different block o f  sprite-
shape d a ta . U si n g  th i s
I •1111=MMIIIIM
method a single sprite may
be animated b y  quickly
changing t h e  s p r i te 's
pointer to switch through a
series o f shapes provided
for that sprite's animation
(e.g. a n  e x p l o s i o n ) .
Switching the pointer rather
than switching between
sprites leaves t h e  o th e r
sprites free for other uses.
The sprite pointers are
the last 8 bytes of unused
screen memory (2040 .—
2047). If you move screen
memory, the pointers will
move with it (but not their
contents), Y o u  m u s t
remember when setting up
your sprite pointers that the
pointer must point to the
ﬁrst byte within the sprite
and that the value in the
sprite pointer is the actual
memory location o f  th e
sprite over 64. Therefore,
the fo l l o w i n g  fo r m u l a
applies:
Location = Sprite pointer *
64
Also i f you are not using
video bank #  0  (default
bank) then you must also
add bank number *  16384
to t h e  location. I f  y o u
haven't switched vi d e o
banks then don't worry.
Two important points to
remember when choosing
where to  put your sprite
data in memory are 1, its
location must be a multiple
of 64, and 2 , check th e
memory map to make sure
that you are only using spare
memory.
Turning Sprites On

to the screen, i t must be

label our sprites from 0 — 7 mined b y  each bit-pair
then we easily determine combination.
which sprites should be on
and which should be off by
the value contained in byte
53269. The way that th e
on/off status of each sprite
is determined is as follows:
A 1 i n  the bit corres-
ponding t o  t h e  sp ri te
determines that the sprite
should be displayed (turned
on) and a 0 determines that
the sprite should n o t be
displayed (turned off).
e.g. 7  6 5 4 3 2 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 = 215
therefore t h e  statement
POKE 53269, 215 would
supply the video chip with
the following information:
Sprites 7,6,4,2,1 and 0 are to
be turned on.
Sprites 5 and 3  are to  be
turned off.
To turn on a single sprite
without e ffe c ti n g  t h e
others, use th e  following
statement:
POKE 53269, PEEK (53269)
OR (215N)
where S N  i s  th e  sprite
number (0 — 7)
To turn off a single sprite
without e ffe c ti n g  t h e
others, use th e  following
statement:
POKE 53269, PEEK (53269)
AND (255 — 2tSN)
Sprite Colour
High resolution (single
colour) sprites can be any
one of the 16 colours. The
colour of each sprite 0 — 7
should be POKEd into their
respective colour registers,
memory location 53287
53294 (see video register
map). Each pixel turned on
within th e  sprite will b e
displayed i n  t h e  colour
determined by the sprite's
colour register, Each pixel
turned off will be displayed
in the colour behind the
sprite (i.e. it is transparent).
Multicolour Sprites
In multicolour mode, i t is
possible t o  h a v e  f o u r

Expanding Sprites
Sprites can b e  expanded
vertically, horizontally o r
both. A sprite is expanded
by putting 2 pixels in place
of land 2 blanks in place of
1 i n  t h e  d i re cti o n  o f
expansion thus giving a 2X
expansion. T o  expand a
sprite horizontally, t h e
corresponding b i t  i n
location 53277 must be set to
1. To reduce the sprite, the
bit must be set to O. Vertical
expansion i s  d o n  i n  th e
same w a y using location
53271. The POKE statements
to control expansion and
reduction o f sprites are as
follows:
2
Horizontal expansion
POKE 53277, PEEK (53277)
OR (2tSN)
Horizontal reduction
POKE 53277, PEEK (53277)
AND (255 — 2/SN)
Vertical expansion
POKE 53271, PEEK (53271)
OR (2tSN)

registers a re  mapped t o
memory location 53248 to
53263 and a most-signiﬁcant-
bit (MSB) register at location
53264. The MSB register is
used to rectify the problem
of horizontal screen width.
The MSB register works as
follows. In  order to  gain
pixel m o v e m e n t ,  t h e
horizontal position register
needs to  be able to  hold
values from 0 to 299 (screen
width). A single register can
only hold values from 0 to
255 therefore we need at
least one more bit to handle
values up to 299. An extra bit
(9th bit) would allow us
control over positions 0 to
511. This is the purpose of
the MSB register. The bits in
the MSB register corres-
pond to the sprite number
(ie bit 0 for sprite 0, bit 1 for
sprite 1, etc.) A register map
of a l l  sprite positioning
registers is given overleaf.
Note t h a t  h o r i z o n t a l
positions 24 and 344 are the
left and right boudaries of
the screen. Sprites continue
to move outside this range
but cannot be seen.
It's about time we had a
look at one of these sprites.
Study t h e  ﬁr s t p r o -
gram a n d  i ts  comments.
Type it in and run it.
Run t h e  program; y o u
should see a square sprite
ﬂoat across the screen.
•To expand the sprite in the
horizontal a n d  vertical
directions before moving,
add the following line:
105 POKE VIDEO + 29,1
POKE VIDEO + 23,1
and run the program again.
The second program
allows you to use the cursor
keys to  draw a  sprite by
editing DATA statements.
Type RUN 1, then use the
cursor keys to move around
the DATA statements. Use
the shift Q  character t o
signify a pixel-ON a n d  a
full-stop to signify a pixel-
OFF. W h e n  y o u  h a v e
ﬁnished d ra w i n g  y o u r
sprite, move the cursor to
the top of the screen, then
keep hitting th e  RETURN
key until you have entered
all of the DATA statements.
Now type RUN, and the
program will generate the
sprites a n d  t h e  D A T A
statements n e e d e d  t o
generate th a t sprite. T o
store these D ATA state-
ments, u s e  t h e  s a m e
method as you used on the
last set of DATA statements.

Priorities
Sprite priority determines if
the sprite should appear in
front o r  behind another
background. I f  th e  back-
groud is another sprite, then
the priority is ﬁxed by the
sprite's s p r i te  n u mb e r.
Sprite 0  has th e  highest
priority, sprite 1 has the next
priority, and so on, up to
sprite 7 . Fo r example, i f
sprite 0  and sprite 7  are
positioned so that they cross
each other, sprite 0 will be in
front of sprite 7, though you
would be able to see sprite 7
through sprite 0 (unless of
course sp ri te  0  w a s a
completely ﬁlled square).
Sprite t o  b a ckg ro u n d
priority is more ﬂexible in
the way that each sprite can
be set with priority above or
below the background. The
sprite t o  b a c k g r o u n d
priorities are controlled by
the sprite priority register
(memory location 53275). A
1 i n  t h e  b i t  n u m b e r
corresponding to the sprite
number will set that sprite
with a lower priority than
the background. A 0 in this
bit position will give the
sprite a  h i g h e r priority
than th e  background. By
moving sprites back and
forth over other objects, at
the same time changing the
sprite-background priori-
ties, it is possible to make it
look as i f the sprites are
moving in front and behind
the object thus creating a
three dimensional effect.
The t h i r d  p r o g r a m
overlays 8  s p r i te s  t o
demonstrate sprite priority.

Sprite Collisions
Sprite c o l l i s i o n s  a r e
detected by the computer
and collision information is
stored in location 53278 for
sprite to sprite collisions and
location 53279 for sprite to
another b a c k g r o u n d
collision. The bit set to 1 in
each o f  these registers
corresponds to  the sprite
involved i n  th e  collision.
The bit stays set until the
register is read (PEEKed). So
if the collision information
is to be used more than
once per collision, it would
be a good idea to store the
value into a variable. Also,
programs that use the sprite
collision registers should
include in their initialization
a PEEK o f  each o f  these
registers to  clear them o f
previous collision data.
Note: A  bit pair 01 in a
multicoloured m o d e  w i l l
not be detected in a sprite to
background collision, even
though it can be seen on the
screen. So, for example, if
you wish to  have objects
that should n o t cause a
collision (e.g. a cloud) then
they should be coloured by
using a  b i t  p a i r  0 1
(multicolour register tt 01)

RELATIVE FILES
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
of telephone calls, enquiries
and questions I receive i t
would seem that one thing
which causes a  l o t  o f
problems to owners of the
1541 disc drive is relative
ﬁles. Except for a few things
the manual is more or less
useless. Using these tw o
programs y o u  should a t
least be able to get BASIC
relative ﬁles working and
once you have got the idea
it i s  easy t o  sta rt t o
manipulate ﬁles and ﬁl e
sizes etc.

Relatively
speaking...
Think of a relative ﬁle as a
large array. Instead of the
array being in RAM though
it i s stored i n  numbered
order on the disc. As with an
array i t is easy to  ﬁnd a
particular record i f  y o u
know the number. I f  the
number is not known it is
possible to search the disc
record by record.
The tw o  programs are
very basic. They have simple
screen displays, there is very
little error checking, and
virtually no string handling.
Once you have got the idea
of what is going on then you
can go back to the manual,
which should then make
more sense and tidy up the
programs.
When creating the ﬁle
for t h e  ﬁr s t  t i m e ,  I
recommend that you use a
blank disc. This will ensure
that all record numbers are
available. Initially create a
ﬁle of 254 characters/record
and have about 100 records.
It is worth noting that it is

Get running
When yo u  r u n  th e  ﬁrst
program you will notice that
an error 'RECORD N OT
PRESENT' appears. Wh e n
creating a ﬁle this is quite
normal and can be ignored.
What does the program do?
PROGRAM 1. LINE 5 is the
number o f  characters/
record. To start with stick to
254 (this is the maximum
possible).
LINE 6  is  t h e  number  o f

records you want to create
initially. Stick to about 100
for now.
LINE 10 opens the ﬁle and
gives it a name. The ,L, part
tells th e  disc that i t is a
relative ﬁle and the CHM)
tells th e  disc th e  record
length.
LINE 40 is an easy way to split
a record into a  two byte
location. N.B. the command
AND.
LINE 50. The "p " stands for
POSITION and this tells the
disc drive to  be ready to
locate the read write head at
the following track/sector.
The CHRSO's in this line are
A: the channel being used
(2 in this case) B: This is the
low byte of the track/sector
address. C : this the high
byte of the address. D: this is
location within the record.
After running the program
and watching th e  display
you should see what i s
happening.
PROGRAM 2. This is split
into tw o  parts, Read and
Write. The screen display is
simple a n d  needs mo re
string handling routines but
these are easy to  write in
later.
VARIABLES USED
RM = 1 Maximum No. o

RN = Record number.
RH = High byte of record
number.

requirements.

P r o g r a m m i n g
Setting out the
programs
The ﬁrst things to note are
some of the do's and don'ts
of BASIC programming.
Firstly, bear in mind when
writing that not only have
you g o t t o  de-bug your
program, b u t  y o u  m a y
discover a  bug in several
months time, so make the
code r e a d a b l e .  A l s o
remember that having got it
working, you may want to
modify it to store more data
and if it is well written, this
will be far easier to do. Do
not try to  p u t to o  many
commands o n  o n e  line.
Having sa i d  th a t, i t  i s
unnecessary to put just one
command on a line but with
a little thought we can soon
see some obvious guide lins.
Here are a few examples:
10 rem your routine in
here
20 rem and here
100 c = c +  1
200 if c 4. 5 then 10
In this case, we alter the
variable ' c '  and want t o
immediately do a test on it
to know whether to end or
not. Having put the test on a
new line, w e  have effec-
tively separated the two. If
we come back to this code
and a d d  a  l i n e  140 fo r
example, although the code
may still work the test has
become further away from
the increment making i t
more difﬁcult t o  follow.
Here is another:
100 for i = 1 to 10
200 if i =5 or =  6 th e n300
240 rem your routine in
here
300 next
o u tw e i g h te d  b y  t h e
disadvantages — do not try
to be memory efﬁcient in
this way.
We will n o w  examine
the REM command. This
command i s  a n  essential
programming tool but must
be used sensibly:
100 nt 0 :  rem initialise nt
to zero
This is hopeless! The REM
says exactly the same as the
code. Much better would
be:
100 nt = 0 : rem number
of times
This tells us what 'ne is being
used for. The code itself tells
us that it is being set to zero,
so why put i t i n  a REM?
Experience will show when
Now l e t's  decide w h a t
variable names t o  use. I
advise having temporary
variables which can be used
to pass data to a subroutine
and t o  b e  received back
from subroutines. Also for
common FOR . . N E X T
loops, try to use the same
variables and avoid using
any variable that you use in a
subroutine. T h i s  i s  a
common problem w h i ch
causes FOR. ..NEXT loops to
end suddenly or never end!
For all the new ﬂags etc, that
is to say all new variables
that a re  speciﬁc t o  th e
program being written and
not i n  c o m m o n  s u b -
routines, use two letters (or
more) because this is more
descriptive and easier t o
follow. 'AM' for amount is
obviously quite clear b u t
then amend your program
so that it is neat and easy to
follow. I n  th i s w a y th e
beneﬁts will become more
obvious.
Getting framed
If yo u r  ﬁrst program i s
successful and you want to
write more, you will need a
program frame containing
your favourite tried a n d
tested routines. I  will call
this program a NET. In your
net y o u  w i l l  need sub-
ro u ti n e s f o r  s c r e e n
handling, disk handling,
error messages and all the
little things that you only
want to write once. After a
while you may add to them
or improve them making
them more elaborate. By
keeping these in a net you
to use REMs and what to put 'F9' for amount is obscure. will have easy access t o
in them. For now, just rem- Using more than two letters them and the subroutines
ember that as you write a bit makes t h e  c o d e  e v e n  will be in the same place in
of co d e  yo u  understand clearer ( 'A M OU N T' f o r  every program making each
it fully but in two months' amount) but is unnecessary program easier to  under-
time i t  w i l l  b e  harder and has some disadvantages stand. As your routines get
to follow, s o  use some —  it uses memory, it leads to more advanced you will ﬁnd
REMS telling y o u  w h a t more syntax errors as BASIC them becoming like a set of
variables are expected for may discover a  reserved advanced B A S IC  c o r n -

In this example we want to REMs do use memory and BASIC only stores the ﬁrst high level language (well

programs, o r  for running
other peoples' programs.
99% of purchasers fall into
the latter category, and we
were surprised to ﬁnd that
there w a s  n o  software
available that took advan-
tage of the extra memory.
One mi g h t expect th a t
products might be in short
supply f o r  w h a t  i s  a
relatively new machine —
but the complete absence
of appropriate programs is
quite bafﬂing. Wh a t can
your friendly Commodore
dealer demonstrate except
the e xi sti n g  r a n g e  o f
software, none of which was
written w i th  th e  8296 i n
mind?!
First in the pipeline, said
Commodore, w o u l d  b e
Handic Software's C a lc-
Result spreadsheet p r o -
gram. CalcResult f o r  th e
8296 is still a few weeks away
from completion, but the
authors very kindly offered
to share their experiences
with us, even to the extent
of getting their program-
ming manager t o  call us
from Sweden.
They felt that the extra
memory was "useful but not
essential" for their sort of
program. The beneﬁt is that
larger spreadsheets w i th
more data can b e  mani-
pulated in the memory of
the system, while main-
taining compatibility with
data o n  earlier machines.
Once CalcResult was u p
and running, their word
processing package might
follow. A n  i n te re sti n g
possibility would be the use
of the expansion RAM as a
"clipboard" to hold results
while programs were being
changed —  the ﬁrst step
towards a n  i n te g ra te d
environment o f  th e  sort
offered by AppleWorks and
Lotus 1-2-3.
Handic also pointed out
that they had to go into the
machine with a  soldering
iron to strap the appropriate
internal jumpers so  that
they could select between
expansion m e m o r y  a n d
ﬁrmware u n d e r software
control (once strapped, a
USER call can be used to
enable a n d  disable a n y
resident E P R O M s  o r
ROMs). Your dealer could
probably do this for you if
necessary. W e  would b e
interested to hear any other
experiences in this area —
perhaps C o m m o d o r e
should add switches which
can b e  used to  conﬁgure
the system with less trouble.
Because the expansion
memory i s conﬁgured i n
ﬁxed 16K blocks you would
have t o  write your own
memory allocation routines
before attempting to access
the m e m o r y  f o r  a n y
sophisticated application
(the clipboard idea would
probably j u s t  u s e  t h e
memory as an ultra-fast disk
drive). If you are converting
a w o r d  processing o r
spreadsheet package, you
will probably have existing
routines which would work
with l i ttl e  modiﬁcation.
Otherwise, you should be
careful t o  design y o u r
allocation routines (which
must sit permanently in the
lower 32K main memory) at
any early stage of develop-
ment. On e  ﬁnal word o f
advice f r o m  Handic —
interrupts a r e  tri cky t o
program. Jumpers a n d
interrupts aside, selecting
memory blocks i s  easily

The 8296 also gives you
four 'p a g e s' o f  v i d e o
memory, instead o f  th e
usual one. This could b e
very useful, and is much
easier t o  program. Com-
modore suggests that you
might use th e  additional
screens for help screens and
menus, though once again
strapping might be required
if yo u  have ﬁtted extra
EPROMs.

Unfortunately, th e  PRINT
statement i n  the resident
basic (4.0) appears to work
with only the default screen
(Commodore number the
screens from 1 to 4 in their
documentation, b u t  y o u
will probably prefer to use a
range from 0 to 3 for ease of
programming - -  in either
case, the default screen is
the lowest number). This
presumably means that you
have t o  u se  t h e  POKE
statement to put characters
onto any o f the alternate
screens. Unless we missed
something in Commodore's
(less than wonderful, as
usual) documentation, this
seems t o  b e  a  ma j o r
stumbling b l o ck t o  p ro -
ductive use o f  the extra
screen memory.
Be that as it may, we did
feel th a t t h e  multi-page
screens w e re  worth t h e
small a mo u n t o f  R A M
invested in them. we have
reproduced some simple
routines which we wrote for
screen handling. Figure 2
shows the POKE sequence
for selecting between the
four screensoNhi le Figures 3
and 4 illustrate a full screen
copy and a  partial copy
respectively. We learned (to
our cost) that the 8296 does
NOT take kindly to errors in
POKE statements, s o  w e
have shown some ways in
which e r r o r s  c a n  b e
detected and trapped (see
Figure 5).
The m o s t  e x c i ti n g
application f o r  multiple
screens is almost certainly
'windowing'. You can try
this with our partial screen
program. The 8296 clears
screen 0 on power-up but
leaves th e  other screens
with random values, so you
would probably wish t o
clear them to blanks using a
looping POKE 32 (space).
The alternate screens are
NOT cleared w h e n  y o u
press reset, so any data you
put i n  them is safe from
everything except a power
c u t
The resident BASIC is
very slow (over 10 seconds
to copy a screenful even
with all remarks removed
and multiple statements on
a line), so you would almost
certainly want to re-code
any windowing routines

like the 68000 series. It runs
slowly and has a  limited
addressing ra n g e . Y o u
might start to worry about
its limitations after a while
— it depends whether you
expect t h a t  y o u r  a p p -
lications w i l l  g r o w  su b -
stantially within the lifetime
of your purchase.
Screen: Contrast a n d
character set are both good.
and you can tilt and swivel
the screen a s  required.
However, we did ﬁnd that
the pronounced curvature
of the screen and the high
persistence phosphor took
a bit of getting used to. This
is simply a  ma tte r o f
individual p re fe re n ce ,
rather t h a n  a  se ri o u s
criticism.
The re vi e w  machine
tended to whine like an old
monochrome TV — some-
thing which yo u r dealer
would presumably adjust
before d e l i ve ri n g  t h e
system.
Keyboard: T h e  k e y -
board has a very 'springy'
feel which would probably
irritate touch typists at ﬁrst.
Keys must b e  depressed
fully before a character is
sent, so there is little risk of
miskeying_ We did feel that
Commodore should have
provided a  fu l l  four-key
cursor p a d , rather th a n
using shifts t o  generate
cursor left and up from their
opposites, given that this
p ro d u ct i s  o b v i o u s l y
intended f o r  th e  serious
business market.
We also thought that
there should be an Enter
key on the numeric keypad
(generating a  carriage
return character). There is
certainly ro o m fo r  these
features on the detachable
keyboard unit, which is one
of the largest on the market.
As w e  g o  t o  press,
Commodore are preparing
plans f o r  promoting th e
8296-D f r o m  September
onwards. The price of the
system w i l l  b e  £1690
excluding V A T  f o r  t h e
standard two-drive c o n -
ﬁguration. This price will
include three '  bundled"
software packages covering
the main applications areas.
These consist o f  Super-
Script, a word processor and
spelling ch e cke r; T h e
Manager. a database ﬁling
package; and CalcResult, a
spreadsheet p r o g r a m .
Bought separately, these
would cost about £500. This
makes the 8296-D reason-
able value for money at the
moment —though we are a
little concerned t h a t  i t
could lose ground to some
of the more up-to-date 16-
bit products w h i ch  w i l l
appear over the next six to
nine months.
Handic's u p g r a d e d
CalcResult will also appear
in September, in a version
which i s compatible with
all 8000 series machines

helpful te a m  o n  (0344-

As t o  a v a i l a b i l i ty ,
Commodore tell us that 250
dealers th ro u g h o u t t h e
country will be stocking the
8296. N o  new peripherals
are being launched for the

available. Tw o  are tractor
feed dot matrix types with
60 cps/80 columns and 150
cps/132 columns respect-
ively, while the third is a
daisywheel fri cti o n  fe e d
printer working at 40 cps/
136 columns. If you want the
diskless version i t will cost
you £805 excluding VAT.
Finally, a  message t o

Commodore 61
ON M Y  COMMODORE
8096 I  use th e  SILICON
OFFICE and o n  my SX-64
I use SUPERBASE. I f  you
have never used programs,
like the above before, here
is a brief description of what
they are used for.
In their basic form they
are best described as a
p r e w r i t t e n  d a ta b a s e
program; t h e i r  p o w e r
however comes when you
want t o  cross reference
information from one ﬁle to
a n o th e r, i n p u t  n e w
information and to generate
a REPORT compiled from
information fro m o n e  o r
more ﬁles. Imagine f o r
example three drawers of a
ﬁling cabinet. Each drawer
contains a set of ﬁles,
eg, Drawer 1 N a me s and
addresses
Drawer 2 Personal ﬁle
(salary, car etc.)
Drawer 3- Work record.
If t h e  company wanted
to send a standard letter to
all employees who satisfy a
particular set of conditions
it would normally be a long
and difﬁcult job checking
and c r o s s  c h e c k i n g
information from the three
drawers. With a program of
the above type however a
small sub-program could be
written to examine all ﬁles
in turn and create a list of all
the people who meet the
requirements. The list could
then be used to personalise
the stock letter which would
have been created o n  a
word processor. That is one
I C
above. O t h e r  uses a r e
86 m a i l i n g  l i s t s ,  p a t i e n t
records, invoicing etc.

OVERV
and i t is often possible to
buy an applications package
to run with the database
management system.
Superbase
I will not try and describe
how to use superbase as it is
a v e r y  comprehensive
program. I will just give an
overview o f  i t  a n d  a
summary o f  h o w  I  have
been able to use it. I had
already learned to use the
SILICON OFFICE a n d  so
when I  ﬁrst came to  use
SUPERBASE I was pleased to
see that there were many
similarities. Within a couple
of weeks I had produced a
stock control application
linked to  an electronic till
drawer which could cope
with about 700 stock lines
and produce daily sales lists,
low stock items, price lists,
etc, etc. SUPERBASE can be
used NAKED, by this I mean
that it can be used as a menu
driven database w i th  a l l
commands entered direct.
By u s i n g  t h e  m e n u
commands you soon get the
idea of manipulating data in
ﬁles and it is then a simple
job of linking these direct
commands together to form
a program.
With discs
In use with a  single disc
drive it is possible to have up
to 15 separate data ﬁles/disc
and also any programs that
you may have produced.
The number of records in
each ﬁl e  i s  i n  th e o ry
unlimited but it is of course
restricted b y  t h e  170K
restriction of the1541 drive.
It is possible and also easy to
use two drives and using this
system I have not yet found
any limitations. Wi th  tw o
EW

S oftwa re
drives i t is easy to  make
backup copies of your data.
Initially I found I was not
bothering to take copies of
my data but the dreaded day
came when with the help of
a split cup of coffee about
three weeks worth of data
had g o n e . On e  o f  t h e
interesting a sp e cts o f
SUPERBASE is that it will link
up to EASYSCRIPT and so
personalised l e tte rs a n d
documents are reasonably
easy t o  cre a te . I  s a y
reasonably easy to  create
because t h i s  i s  n o t  a
program that you would be
able to just load and run —
you would need to spend
quite a few hours learning
to link and manipulate ﬁles
and to program effectively.
Basically speaking...
The language u s e d  b y
SUPERBASE is a mixture of
BASIC plus some of its own
c o m m a n d s . I t s  o w n
commands can be entered
in an abbreviated form or in
a sentence, eg, to create a
list o f  all records from a
particular ﬁle you can write
into a program 'display all
records from ﬁle name' and
to create a specialised list
you can simply say 'ﬁnd list
where (to w n ) =  ( to w n
name)'.
This is the easy way to
input commands but i t is
effective and once you have
the idea yo u  ca n  i n p u t
commands i n  a n  abbrev-
iated fo rm. Th e  abbrev-
iations are logical and are
still meaningful when you
go back to a program some
time later.
There are built in pages
called help screens which
you can call up and these
pages give you the syntax
and use o f  most o f  the
i mp o rta n t c o m m a n d s
available. O n  th e  whole
it i s  u se r friendly p r o -
gram w h i c h  i s  o n l y
limited i n  u se  b y  y o u r
imagination. Some o f  th
important features o f ﬁle
manipulation a r e  l i ste d
below w i t h  a  b r i e f
explanation o f  t h e i r
function.
1. BATCH. This allows the
whole ﬁle to  be updated
automatically for instance if
the VAT rate changed i t
would be possible to update
each record with a simple
list of commands.
2. FILE SIZE. It is possible to
increase th e  length o f  a
record without losing any
data. This is a very useful
feature a n d  o n e  w h i ch
should be available on any
good database.
3. FIND LIST. This allows you
to create a specialised list of
things which satisfy a given
set of conditions. There can
be as many conditions as
you want and this created
list c a n  b e  u s e d  a n d
destroyed or kept for future
use.
4. DATE. This function is
very useful. It enables you to
set up conditions that must
be met by a given date. Very
useful on invoice/statement
type applications.
It is possible i f you have
written an application with
SUPERBASE to PROTECT it
so that the program cannot
be listed and also to pass-
word parts of the program
to restrict unauthorised use,
a feature which I have found
useful to  restrict access of
personal d e ta i l s w h i l e
allowing basic name address
type information t o  b e
readily accessible. Screen
colours ca n  b e  changed
easily and sound can b e
used to  draw attention to
important inputs. There is a
built i n  software printer
interface and so you should
be able to use most of the
common p r i n te r s  a n d
switching from printer to
screen is simplicity itself: if
when writing a program you
want to see the effects of a
report on screen rather than
on the printer i t is just a
matter o f  replacing t h e
word PRINT with DISPLAY
in th e  program. This can
save pumping out reams of
paper during debugging.
Great stuff
This i s a  program that I
would n o t  l i k e  t o  b e
without. It is versatile and
probably the most useful of
all m y  software. I t  costs
about [1 0 0 ,0 0  b u t  i s
considerably cheaper than
its big brothers on larger
machines. One thing that is
important is when I had a
problem with one o f the
programs PR EC ISION
Software were very keen
and quick to help. They do
seem concerned with after
sales service, something
which i s sadly lacking i n
many s o f t / h a r d w a r e
companies.
Dealers amongst y o u
may be interested to know
that th e re  i s  a  demon-
stration disc available which
shows much of the potential

- the sophisticated spreadsheet
Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs.
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PET/CEM 4000 8, 8000 series_
Available through dealers or from:
