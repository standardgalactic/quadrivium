Introduction      1
Introduction
S
alesforce.com For Dummies, 6th Edition, is for users of Salesforce, including 
those users who have the Unlimited, Enterprise, or Professional Edition. It’s 
for Salesforce users who want to quickly know how to use this web-based 
application, running “in the cloud” — also known as Software-as-a-Service 
(SaaS) — for sales, marketing, and customer service.

We show you everything you need to know to manage the life cycle of your 
­customer relationships in Salesforce, from qualifying leads to closing opportunities 
to handling service agent inquiries. Along the way, we share a laugh or two. And 
this book can expose you to useful features and functionality that you might not 
have even known existed!
Note: Not all portions of this book necessarily apply to your edition of Salesforce. 
Different editions have varying degrees of features and functionality. We make 
sure to point out the differences where relevant.
This book has been revised to reflect the latest Salesforce.com product and feature 
offerings as of the Spring 2016 release. Salesforce is an Internet-based service 
where new releases occur simultaneously for all customers, about three times a 
year, without your having to lift a finger (okay, except to just log in). Because of 
this model, Salesforce.com can release new versions of its product faster than 
many traditional software vendors — and faster than we can write! We did our 
best to update this book to the current version of the product, but please bear in 
mind that new versions of Salesforce are always in the works.
Keep in mind that references to the product use the word Salesforce, and references 
to the company that makes the family of products, or the family of products as a 
whole, use the term Salesforce.com. That’s a tiny detail, but we didn’t want you to 
think our eagle eyes had glossed over it!
Finally, within this book, you may note that some web addresses break across two 
lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and want to visit one of these web 
pages, simply key in the web address exactly as it’s noted in the text, pretending 
as though the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as an e-book, you’ve 
got it easy — just click the web address to be taken directly to the web page.
Foolish Assumptions
Please forgive us, but we make one or two foolish assumptions about you, the reader. 
We assume the following:
»
» You have access to a high-speed Internet connection, have used a web 
browser, and have access to the most up-to-date version of your chosen 
2      Salesforce.com For Dummies

browser. If we assumed incorrectly, you have much more pressing problems 
than understanding the effective use of Salesforce.
»
» You have a Salesforce account and some interest in knowing how to use it, 
beyond the mere curiosity of reading our riveting prose.
»
» You have some business experience — at least enough to understand that 
winning deals is good, and losing deals is bad.
»
» You have at least a vague idea of what a database is, including basic concepts 
such as fields, records, files, and folders. (Imagine an organized filing cabinet 
and all its contents.)
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, we place icons here and there that high-
light important points. Here’s what the icons mean:
Next to the Tip icon, you can find shortcuts, tricks, and best practices to use Salesforce 
more effectively or productively.
Pay extra attention when you see a Warning icon. It means that you might be 
about to do something that you’ll regret later.
When we explain a juicy little fact that bears remembering, we mark it with a 
Remember icon. When you see this icon, prick up your ears. You can pick up some-
thing that could be of wide or frequent use as you work with Salesforce.
When we’re forced to describe something geeky, a Technical Stuff icon appears in 
the margin. You don’t have to read what’s beside this icon if you don’t want to, 
although some readers might find the technical detail helpful.
Beyond the Book
In addition to what you’re reading right now, this product also comes with a free 
access-anywhere Cheat Sheet that tells you how to perform your day-to-day 
functions in Salesforce. To get this Cheat Sheet, simply go to www.dummies.com 
and type Salesforce.com For Dummies Cheat Sheet in the Search box.

ou may not realize it yet, but every time you log in to Salesforce, you’re 
accessing an extremely powerful lever of change for you, your group, and 
your company.
Sounds like a tall order, but consider this: What value do you put on your customer 
relationships? Your partner relationships? If you’re a sales rep, it’s your liveli-
hood. And if you’re in management, you have fewer assets more valuable than 
your existing partner and customer base. What if you had a tool that could truly 
help you manage your partners and customers?
That’s where customer relationship management software comes in. Customer 
relationship management (CRM) is an umbrella term for the parts of your business 
that are “front office,” also known as those that have direct interactions with your 
Chapter 1

8      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
customers and prospective customers. The CRM life cycle encompasses business 
processes and associated applications that help businesses better track their leads, 
manage customers, track opportunities, resolve cases, and more.
The more you and your team adopt a CRM system into your work, and you deter-
mine how you want your business process to be reflected within the technology, 
the more information you’ll have at your fingertips to deepen customer relation-
ships and improve your overall business.
In this chapter, we establish a common understanding of the CRM life cycle. Then 
we describe areas where a CRM system can improve your business.
Introducing the Customer Relationship 
Management life cycle
Within the world of CRM exist additional processes focused on specific areas of 
the life cycle. You may hear the phrases marketing automation, sales force automa-
tion, and service and support. These are front-office areas of your business that 
vendors (like Salesforce.com!) work on to make your front-office teams more 
efficient and productive.
Understanding your customer’s customer
How can you sell to and retain customers if you don’t understand their needs, key 
contacts, and what account activities and transactions have taken place? A CRM 
system allows you to track all your important customer interactions and data so 
that you can develop solutions that deliver real value to your customers, which in 
turn should mean higher customer satisfaction with their customers. Whether 
people are in marketing, sales, or customer support, they should all have the abil-
ity to access the same source of truth about your customer. After all, how can your 
company serve its customers well if you’re not familiar with how your products 
and services help improve your customers’ customers’ (no, that’s not a typo) 
experience?
Centralizing customer information  
under one roof
How much time have you wasted tracking down a customer contact or an address 
that you know exists within the walls of your company? What about trying to find 

CHAPTER 1  Customer Relationship Management at a Glance      9
out which sales rep owns the relationship with a subsidiary of a global customer? 
A good CRM system lets you quickly centralize and organize your accounts and 
contacts so that you can capitalize on that information when you need to.
Looking to Customer Relationship 
Management to Solve Critical  
Business Challenges
We could write another book telling you all the great things you can do with Sales-
force, but you can get the big picture about CRM systems’ benefits from this chap-
ter. We focus here on the most common business challenges that we hear from 
sales, marketing, and support executives — and how a CRM system can overcome 
them.
Expanding the funnel
Inputs and outputs, right? The more leads you generate and pursue, the greater 
the chance that your revenue will grow. So, the big question is, “How do I make 
the machine work?” A CRM application helps you plan, manage, measure, and 
improve lead generation, qualification, and conversion. You can see how much 
business you or your team generates, the sources of that business, and who in 
your team is making it happen.
Consolidating your pipeline
Pipeline reports give companies insight into future sales, yet we’ve worked with 
companies in which generating the weekly pipeline could take more than a day of 
cat herding and guesswork. Reps waste time updating spreadsheets. Managers 
waste time chasing reps and scrubbing data. Bosses waste time tearing their hair 
out because the information is old by the time they get it. The prevalence of cloud 
computing makes this traditional method of siloed data collection obsolete (or 
pretty darn inefficient). A good CRM system helps you shorten or eliminate all 
that pulling and pasting of data across multiple sources. As long as reps manage 
all their opportunities in one place that’s always available, managers can generate 
updated pipeline reports with the click of a button.

10      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
Collaborating effectively with  
your colleagues
Remember when you were the new person at the company, and you had to find out 
who knew everything about a particular customer, process, or product? Even at 
smaller companies, it takes time to discover who possesses that extra bit of his-
torical knowledge that could help you close that important deal or resolve a sup-
port issue. Other times, you may be so busy that you’re out of the loop on certain 
key company updates, even when departments try to keep you informed. What if 
you could harness the insights from others within the company, yet not be over-
whelmed by information overload? A CRM system should provide a means for 
employee communication that increases internal awareness and collaboration on 
the business issues that matter the most to you, so you’re always up to date and 
never caught unawares.
Working as a team
How many times have you thought that your own co-workers got in the way of 
selling? Oftentimes, the challenge isn’t the people, or even the technology, but 
standardizing processes and clarifying roles and responsibilities. A CRM system 
will let you define teams and processes for sales, marketing, and customer service 
so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. It should also be flexible 
enough to change all those team members the next time a reorg happens. Although 
a CRM system doesn’t solve corporate alignment issues, the tool should drive and 
manage better team collaboration.
Extending your sales force with partners
In many industries, selling directly is a thing of the past. To gain leverage and 
cover more territory, many companies work through partners. CRM systems 
should let your channel team track and associate partners’ deals and get better 
insight about who their top partners are. Partners now can strengthen their  
relationships with their vendors by collaborating more easily on joint sales and 
marketing efforts.
Beating the competition
How much money have you lost to competitors? How many times did you lose a 
deal only to discover, after the fact, that it went to your archenemy? If you know 
who you’re up against, you can probably better position yourself to win the oppor-
tunity. CRM systems let you and your teams track competition on deals, collect 
competitive intelligence, and develop action plans to wear down your foes.

CHAPTER 1  Customer Relationship Management at a Glance      11
Improving the customer experience
As a salesperson, have you ever walked into a customer’s office expecting a bed of 
roses only to be hit with a landmine because of an unresolved customer issue? And 
if you work in customer support, how much time do you waste on trying to ­identify 
the customers and reviewing the context of previous support interactions? A CRM 
system should let you efficiently capture, manage, and resolve a high volume of 
customer issues that come in from a variety of communication channels. The 
­customer relationship doesn’t end once they’ve bought your product — that’s just 
the beginning. A CRM system should allow sales reps to have visibility into the 
health of their accounts, and service can stay well informed of sales and account 
activity.
Measuring the business
How can you improve what you can’t measure? Simple, huh? If you use your CRM 
system correctly and regularly to manage customers, you have data to make 
informed decisions. That benefits everyone. If you’re a rep, you know what you 
need to do to get the rewards you want. If you’re a manager, you can pinpoint 
where to get involved to drive your numbers. A CRM system’s reporting and dash-
boards should provide easy-to-use tools to measure and analyze your business.
Selecting Salesforce as Your Customer 
Relationship Management System
Salesforce wasn’t the first CRM system to hit the market, but it’s dramatically 
different from the other CRM systems you may have used (spreadsheets and sticky 
notes count as a system, too!). Unlike traditional CRM software, Salesforce is the 
first successful business application offered as an Internet service. You sign up 
and log in through a browser, and it’s immediately available. We currently call 
this cloud computing, where the customers access “the cloud” (that is, the Inter-
net) for their business needs, and are not required to install any traditional soft-
ware on, presumably, Earth. As long as you have an Internet connection, you can 
be anywhere in the world and have access to the clouds.
You may already be at a company that uses cloud-based applications, as Sales-
force.com’s success has spawned a whole new marketplace full of business appli-
cations done “in the cloud.” Or you may just be entering the workforce, but you’re 
very familiar with the use of Internet-applications in your personal life (think 
Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook). If this is your first foray into cloud computing, 

12      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
you may be taking a first step by yourself or with the rest of your company. Don’t 
worry — your company made the right choice by picking Salesforce.
Salesforce customers typically say that it’s unique for three major reasons:
»
» It’s fast. When you sign on the dotted line, you want your CRM system up and 
running yesterday. Traditional CRM software can take more than a year to 
deploy; compare that to months or even weeks with Salesforce.
»
» It’s easy. End user adoption is critical to any application, and Salesforce wins 
the ease-of-use category hands down. You can spend more time putting it to 
use and less time figuring it out.
»
» It’s effective. Because it’s easy to use and can be customized quickly to meet 
business needs, customers have proven that it has improved their bottom 
lines.
Salesforce’s success has empowered a whole new generation of managers and 
administrators to become business operations gurus. Cloud computing’s generally 
lower licensing costs, its ability to allow system configuration to happen with no 
prior programming experience, and its ability to make modifications quickly to 
the system mean that newer businesses can compete with slower, older, bigger 
competitors, but at a fraction of the cost.
In the next chapter, we cover more specifics about Salesforce.com’s products.

Discovering 
Salesforce.com’s 
Products
N
ow that you have a general idea about what Salesforce is, let’s delve into 
the various products that Salesforce.com offers. Generally speaking, the 
products we cover here fall into the three major categories or departments 
traditionally used to understand customer relationship management (CRM): sales, 
marketing, and service.
You may not have thought about it yet, but if you think about the basic structure 
of CRM, it follows the customer journey from pre-sales to sales and finally post-
sales. In other words, marketing departments market the business to spark inter-
est in a customer base and attract potential leads for your sales teams. When those 
leads are good and qualified, the lead is handed off to sales to close a deal. After 
the sale, the customer interacts with customer support for service, questions, or 
feedback about the product sold.
When you step back and look at the big picture, this entire life cycle centers around 
the customer. As you can see, we’re trying to sufficiently hammer home the fact 
that Salesforce.com and its products are all about enhancing the relationship 
Chapter 2

14      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
between your business and your customer. Although it’s important to see this big 
picture, Salesforce.com also recognizes that the devil is in the details, especially 
from your customers’ perspective. Salesforce.com encourages its users to capture 
customer details and use them to improve this customer relationship.
In this chapter, we discuss three of Salesforce.com’s products and show you how 
they can transform a relationship between an organization and its customer base. 
First, we show you how you can improve your selling with Sales Cloud. Then we 
talk about Marketing Cloud — how it improves lead quality and automates impor-
tant marketing tasks. Then we look at customer support and the features of Ser-
vice Cloud that streamline it. Finally, we wrap up the chapter by helping you 
decide which Salesforce edition is right for you.
Using Sales Cloud to Win More Deals
Sales Cloud helps companies increase their sales success in a number of ways that 
we describe in the next few pages. But first, it’s important to note that any system 
you use is only as good as the data entered in it. This is an important point that 
cannot be emphasized enough throughout this book. If your data is stale and out-
dated or just plain incorrect, the entire infrastructure built around it is essentially 
worthless. And that’s why user adoption is so important. With Salesforce, it’s easy 
to put in place a number of guardrails to ensure that the integrity of your data 
isn’t compromised. Assuming that data is up to date and accurate, Salesforce is a 
powerful sales machine that gives organizations all around the world insight into 
their businesses.
Making sales groups more effective
So, how does Salesforce do it? Let’s look at a few ways Sales Cloud makes sales 
teams more efficient at their jobs.
Account management and contact management are the focal point of sales teams 
and the foundation of Salesforce.com’s products. What would a CRM tool be if you 
couldn’t use it to track your customers and the organizations they’re a part of? 
Accounts are those organizations or businesses. Contacts are the individuals that 
belong to those Accounts. Salesforce lets you establish and differentiate between 
your customers, partners, competitors, and distributors effortlessly. It also shows 
you valuable information about these people and organizations in one place 
(again, assuming someone is inputting that data).
This allows any company using Salesforce to view customer details quickly and 
easily. Moreover, it ensures that any department within that company is looking 

CHAPTER 2  Discovering Salesforce.com’s Products      15
at the same customer details, assuming you permit it. It’s also built with the user 
in mind, providing a simple user interface so that inputting this crucial informa-
tion isn’t too cumbersome. Of course, it can get laborious over time if you aren’t 
careful. But Salesforce gives administrators what they need to make entering or 
updating accounts and contacts easy.
Another way Salesforce boosts sales efficiency is by minimizing time spent trying 
to communicate across and within teams. Salesforce provides multiple tools for 
on-demand work collaboration, as well as quick communication. Many companies 
see a dramatic decline in emails after using Chatter. Tasks and events that are 
automatically created and synced to the digital calendars of sales teams also 
increase efficiency, forecasting, and opportunity management.
Improving sales productivity
Sales Cloud can be used to dramatically increase sales productivity for many orga-
nizations. Sales Cloud can increase forecasting accuracy, which has many obvious 
benefits. Tracking and managing leads, following up with them, and converting 
them with a single click of a button can help sales teams focus more on selling and 
less on entering data into a cumbersome Excel spreadsheet. Organizing massive 
amounts of data and presenting these results in a way that makes sense to users 
in real time is one of the most powerful weapons of Sales Cloud.
In essence, there really is no secret formula to how Salesforce boosts productivity 
and efficiency for sales teams. You can manage and view all customer information 
in one place, while updating contacts or following up with them (again, from the 
same single place), and track all this using powerful reporting to see trends over 
time and act accordingly. You can organize your tasks by priority, forecast more 
accurately, and respond to customers more quickly, thereby helping your business 
become a “customer company.”
Generating Better Leads  
with Marketing Cloud
We could write a separate book about Salesforce Marketing Cloud and do a deep 
dive into the various features it offers, but you can get the big picture from this 
section. Marketing Cloud is really a suite of multiple product offerings, but in this 
section we focus on email campaigns, marketing automation, and lead manage-
ment, and how Marketing Cloud can improve your organization’s ability to exe-
cute on all of them.

16      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
Managing email campaigns  
with Marketing Cloud
How can you drive online commerce, as well as sell to and build customer rela-
tionships, without email? Email is the engine behind these forces. Marketing 
Cloud gives companies the tools to quickly create and automate attention-­grabbing 
emails to customers throughout the customer life cycle. It’s essentially a user 
interface for managing communications and content to a wide customer base. The 
platform maintains mailing lists and schedules and can modify email messages 
based on what recipients read, click, and forward. You can easily filter your sub-
scriber base so that you’re sending specific, targeted emails based on criteria or 
events of your choosing. You don’t want certain customers to be bothered by email 
campaigns? No problem. All of this can be set up and monitored as you desire.
ExactTarget is the name Marketing Cloud used to go by, so if you see ExactTarget 
in documentation somewhere, don’t get confused.
Improving marketing automation
How much time have you wasted tracking down customer activity, emailing 
potential buyers that weren’t even interested, or trying to understand who clicked 
your links? Marketing automation is a general term for platforms that enable the 
automation of repetitive tasks, as they relate to marketing on multiple online 
channels. In other words, automating marketing communication. So, via multiple 
channels, a company that uses marketing automation is able to manage and auto-
mate the targeting, timing, and content of outbound messages. What’s more, it 
can do this intelligently, using cues from prospective actions and behaviors on the 
customer side.
Think of this like responding to body language. In today’s world, consumers do 
their homework and visit the websites of multiple competitors before deciding 
which product they want to buy. Email blasts are no longer acceptable means of 
capturing a large piece of the consumer pie. More personalized and sensitive com-
munications must be sent out, based on various criteria such as the buyer’s role in 
his or her organization or the buyer’s purchase readiness. It’s more important 
than ever to send the right message at the right time.
Marketing Cloud includes a host of features that assist in automating these mar-
keting processes. Even better, Marketing Cloud is already part of the Salesforce 
network, meaning that you can leverage all the information in one database, 
instead of worrying about complex integration of various systems feeding into 
one another. Now it’s easier than ever to manage these interactions and deploy 
online campaigns from a central platform.

Identifying qualified leads with Pardot
Leads are the lifeblood of your business. The more leads you generate and pursue, 
the greater the chance that your revenue will grow. We already know that with 
Salesforce, you can plan, manage, measure, and improve lead generation, qualifi-
cation, and conversion. You can see how much business you or your team gener-
ates, the sources of that business, and who in your team is making it happen. 
What about the step preceding that, though? There’s no use in filling your pipeline 
with leads that won’t actually follow through. So, how do you make sure your 
leads are qualified?
Pardot, Salesforce’s marketing automation tool, ensures that you fill your pipeline 
with the highest-quality leads. You can use the tool to create custom landing 
pages, lead capture forms, and targeted personalized emails. This helps your 
business shorten the sales cycle and close deals faster. You can set up personalized 
lead scoring based on criteria that you decide, to evaluate how qualified prospec-
tive buyers are. You can control which marketing content and messaging goes out 
to those leads based on that score criteria. Finally, you can add those leads that 
aren’t quite ready to buy to your nurture campaigns, so that you can spend more 
time “nurturing” them into high-scoring leads that will more likely purchase 
your product. This, in turn, accelerates your pipeline and ensures that team effort 
is being spent where it will pay off most, all from a central place.
Providing Excellent Customer  
Service with Service Cloud
When the sale is closed, good companies don’t say sayonara. An organization 
should still keep tabs on customers, or have relevant purchase history ready on 
the off chance that the customer will reach out with questions or issues. This is 
the foundation of customer support. Salesforce Service Cloud is a tool that helps 
call centers and customer service agents track customer interactions after point of 
sale.
This section provides an overview of what you can do with Service Cloud. For a lot 
more information, see Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies, by Jon Paz and TJ Kelley 
(Wiley).

18      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
Managing customer interactions with cases
Remember when you used to call a toll-free number about a broken product that 
you bought? Maybe you emailed a support email address or filled out a web form. 
Whichever method you chose, chances are, you weren’t at your happiest at that 
moment. And who can blame you? It’s critical that customers receive world-class 
customer service from companies. Today, customers demand satisfaction more 
than ever before. If they aren’t satisfied, they can easily turn to competitors, or 
even worse, create smear campaigns against a company with bad customer service 
on social media networks.
Have you ever heard a customer service representative say, “One second while I 
pull up your record”? Those records are what we call cases in Service Cloud. Cases 
are related to contact records, so when a customer calls in, an agent can quickly 
pull up her record and see not only her purchase history, but also a record of every 
issue and interaction that customer has had with your organization. Cases, and 
the ability to clearly see what’s going on with customers, make both your cus-
tomer service reps, as well as your customers themselves, much happier. Nobody 
wants to be transferred to another agent, only to have to repeat the issue for the 
third time.
Service Cloud uses case management to expedite and streamline customer service, 
creating a much more efficient experience for everyone involved and bringing 
your service organization into the 21st century.
Interacting with the customer  
across multiple channels
Service Cloud has an added benefit: the ability to interact with customers across 
multiple channels. Or perhaps it’s better said differently: Service Cloud gives your 
customers the choice of how they want to connect with your company.
Not only can customers choose to contact you anytime, anywhere, and from any 
device, but they can also choose the medium through which they do so. Some cus-
tomers are old-fashioned and prefer calling a toll-free number. Other customers 
dread long hold times and would rather chat with an agent online. Giving your 
customers the choice to contact you the way they see fit will do wonders for their 
perception of your company. Service Cloud gives you many different ways to do 
this, and it will pay off in terms of satisfaction, as well as reduced operational cost.

CHAPTER 2  Discovering Salesforce.com’s Products      19
Deciding Which Salesforce  
Edition Is Best for You
If you already use Salesforce, this topic may be a moot point. At the very least, you 
know which version of Salesforce you have.
If you’re not sure which edition you have, look at the top of your browser after 
you’ve logged into Salesforce.
All versions have the same consistent look and feel, but each varies by feature, 
functionality, and pricing. If you’re considering using Salesforce, consult with an 
account executive for more details about edition differences, pricing, and upgrade 
paths. Here are four versions of Salesforce.com’s service:
»
» IQ Starter: This edition has replaced the Group and Contact Manager 
editions. It’s a basic, out-of-the-box CRM system that offers basic account and 
contact management for up to five users.
»
» Professional: A thorough CRM system for any size organization that’s starting 
to nail down processes. Again, you can track the full sales life cycle from a new 
lead to a closed opportunity. Dashboards allow managers to track key metrics 
at a glance. Some optional features for businesses with more detailed process 
needs (such as managing marketing campaigns, creating contracts, tracking 
various products sold, or accessing Salesforce while offline) come at an extra 
cost.
»
» Enterprise: More sales and service functionality for more complex organiza-
tions, including the ability to integrate with other systems within your 
company, and the ability to create custom solutions with code. This edition 
provides more value than if you were to pay extra for certain add-on features 
in more basic editions. If you absolutely need your business processes to look 
and act a specific way, this edition provides more ways to make that happen 
for you.
»
» Unlimited: Even more customization capabilities for extending Salesforce to 
other business uses. You need a dedicated (and usually technical) administra-
tor to take advantage of all the options that this edition delivers.
»
» Performance: This edition offers bundled pricing for Sales and Service Cloud 
licensing. It has everything the Unlimited Edition provides, but also includes 
features such as Live Agent Chat, an integrated knowledge base, as well as 
additional sandboxes.

20      PART 1  Introducing Salesforce
Salesforce.com also provides another edition, Developer Edition, which is a free 
instance of Salesforce with which developers can test and build third-party solu-
tions. It has full functionality but a very limited license count and storage space.
Whichever edition you choose, the good news is that every edition of Salesforce 
is rich with features that can help companies of every size address their business 
challenges. You can choose a more basic edition today and upgrade later, as 
needed. Upgrades happen in the background and are easy, so you can focus on 
the business processes that drive the need for new functionality. And when 
Salesforce.com rolls out new releases of its service, it provides product enhance-
ments for the different editions wherever relevant.
PROFESSIONAL OR ENTERPRISE EDITION?
Most companies tend to make a decision between using Professional or Enterprise 
Edition. Budget may be an issue, but the decision usually boils down to core business 
needs. Consider these questions:
•	 Does your company have different groups with distinct sales processes, customers, 
and products?
•	 Does your company have a lead-generation or service team that relies on a call 
script when initially speaking with prospects or customers?
•	 Does your company plan to integrate Salesforce with other applications?
•	 Does your company require complex data migration into Salesforce?
•	 Does your company need greater control over users, what they see, and what they 
can do?
•	 Does your company sell in defined teams with specific roles?
•	 Does your company require consistent, specific workflow or approval steps to 
­further automate processes?
If the answer to any of these questions is a definitive “Yes,” your company should 
­probably at least evaluate Enterprise Edition, and possibly Performance Edition.

f an application isn’t easy to use, you won’t use it. Period. Salesforce succeeds 
not only because it offers a universe of integrated tools but also because users 
can pick it up within minutes. You navigate Salesforce much the same way you 
do other websites: by clicking text links and buttons.
Still, you have so many ways to navigate Salesforce that it makes sense to lay 
down the obvious (and not-so-obvious) best practices for getting around the 
application.
Even if you’re familiar with Salesforce, you may want to scan this chapter because 
we cover terms that we use repeatedly throughout this book.
In this chapter, you can find out how to log in to Salesforce and use the home page 
to manage your activities, create records, and jump to other tabs. We briefly review 
the major functional areas and describe how to use the internal home pages. 
Finally, we introduce you to the optional Lightning Experience that ushers in a 
dramatically different look and feel for end-users.
Chapter 3

24      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Getting Familiar with Basic  
Salesforce Terms
Before we delve into the mechanics of navigating Salesforce, familiarize yourself 
with these basic terms:
»
» Salesforce: The secure website that your users log in to that contains your 
customer information. Salesforce.com, Inc., offers a family of products used 
by hundreds of thousands of customers, but each company’s secure website 
is separate from the other websites and may look different in order to suit 
that company’s unique needs. When we use the terms Sales Cloud, Marketing 
Cloud or Service Cloud, those are parts of Salesforce specifically meant for use 
by sales and marketing or by a support organization.
»
» Home tab: The main page that appears when you log in to Salesforce or click 
the Home tab.
»
» Tabs: Clickable words appear in a row across the top of any Salesforce page. 
When selected, a word is highlighted and looks like a tab. Each tab represents 
a major module in which your company needs to know some information. By 
clicking a tab, you go to a tab-specific home page. For example, if you click the 
Accounts tab, the Accounts home page appears.
»
» Tab home pages: These are the pages where you go to find, organize, and 
manage specific information related to a particular tab. For example, to access 
your opportunity records, you could go to the Opportunities home page.
»
» Object: Often used interchangeably with the name of a tab. Generally used by 
administrators when talking about creating custom apps. For example, you 
may tell a user to “click the Account tab,” or you may hear your system 
administrator refer to the “Account object.”
»
» Apps: Tabs that have been grouped together and given a name, providing you 
with the convenience of seeing only those tabs most relevant to you.
»
» Record: A record is a page in Salesforce made up of a bunch of fields that 
hold information to describe a specific object. For example, a contact record 
typically contains fields pertinent to a person, including name, title, phone 
number, and email address. A record is displayed on a detail page.
»
» Detail page: A web page that shows both the saved record and a set of 
related lists pertinent to the record.
»
» Chatter feed: If you have Chatter enabled (see Chapter 6), you’ll see the 
center column of your logged-in Salesforce experience with a chronological 
list of updates made by you or other co-workers. This feed is a critical way for 
Salesforce users within your organization to communicate with each other.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      25
»
» Search bar: In the upper-left portion of your Salesforce page, a search field 
resides as another way you can quickly find companies or contacts. Search 
results returned can be customized to return only a certain type of record.
We often use the terms record and detail page interchangeably. From a detail 
page, you can perform and track a variety of tasks related to the specific 
record. For example, if you have and are looking at an Account detail page for 
Cisco, you see fields about the company and lists of other records related to 
Cisco.
»
» Related lists: Lists that comprise other records linked to the record that 
you’re looking at. For example, the Account detail page for Acme may display 
related lists of contacts, opportunities, activities, and so on associated with 
that company.
»
» Sidebar: Located at the left margin of a Salesforce page, the sidebar displays 
messages and alerts, custom links, recent items, and a drop-down list that you 
can use to create new records.
Accessing Salesforce
You need to log in to your account to access your company’s instance of Salesforce 
because every company’s Salesforce website is different, and Salesforce.com goes 
to great lengths to protect your company’s information.
Setting up a password
The first time you log in to the Salesforce service, you’ll do so from an email you 
receive containing your Salesforce login information. To set your password, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Open the email and click the link provided.
A page appears, prompting you to set a new password and security question.
2.	 Complete the fields.
Be sure to select a question and provide an answer that can verify your identity 
if you forget your password. Use this password from now on unless your 
administrator resets the password.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Salesforce home page appears.

26      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Logging in
You log in to Salesforce just as you would any other secure website.
To log in, open a browser and follow these steps:
1.	 In your browser’s address bar, type https://login.salesforce.com 
and then press Enter.
The Salesforce.com login page, shown in Figure 3-1, appears.
To save yourself steps when logging in, bookmark the login page in your 
favorite web browser.
2.	 Enter your username and password, and then click the Log In button.
Your username is typically your corporate email address. Click the Remember 
Me check box if you want your computer to remember it. After you click Log In, 
you may be asked to register your mobile phone. This is an additional, optional 
security step. After this step, your main home page appears.
For security purposes, Salesforce notices when you’re trying to log in to the web-
site from a different computer or a different browser than the one you first used. 
If this happens, make sure that you have access to your email or mobile phone 
(remember when Salesforce asked you to register your mobile phone number?) 
FIGURE 3-1:  
Logging in to 
Salesforce.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      27
because Salesforce emails or text messages you a confirmation code to confirm 
that you are who you say you are.
Navigating the Home Page
Every time you log in to Salesforce, you begin at your home page. The look and feel 
of the elements on your home page are similar to other users’ home pages, but the 
tasks and events that appear in the body of the page are specific to you.
Use the home page to manage your calendar and tasks, stay informed of the latest 
Chatter conversations, jump to other areas by clicking tabs, or access recent items 
by using the sidebar. If your company has customized the home page, you may 
also see key charts or graphs from your company’s dashboards (visual snapshots 
of key performance metrics based on your custom report data).
Finding records with Search
At the top of every Salesforce page, you’ll find the Global Search bar. You can find 
a majority of the information that you want by using Search. To search for infor-
mation, follow these steps:
1.	 At the top of Salesforce, enter keywords into the Search field and then 
click the Search button.
A Search Results page appears, as shown in Figure 3-2. Salesforce organizes 
the search results in lists according to the major types of records, including 
accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities.
FIGURE 3-2:  
Looking at a 
Search Results 
page.

28      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
2.	 Scroll down the page. If you find a record that you want to look at, click a link 
in the Name column for the row that represents that record.
The detail page appears, allowing you to review the record and its related lists.
3.	 If you see too many results, you can limit them to items you own or search 
for an exact phrase by clicking Options to the right of the Search Again 
button on the Search Results page. You can also select a single type of record 
from the list in the sidebar.
If you can’t find what you’re looking for, try adding the asterisk (*) wildcard 
before, after, or in the middle of your keywords to expand your search to 
words that start with, end with, or are similar to your keywords.
If you’re focusing on a page (such as a list of search results or a report) and 
want to open one of the results in a new browser tab, instead of clicking the 
link, right-click that link and choose Open Link in New Tab from the contextual 
menu that appears.
Managing your calendar
The calendar section of the home page defaults to a calendar of the current month 
and your scheduled events for the next seven days. Like other calendar tools, the 
calendar allows you to drill down. Your scheduled events are based on events that 
you assigned to yourself or that other users have assigned to you.
From this calendar section (shown in Figure 3-3), you can do the following:
»
» Schedule a new activity. Click the New Event button, and a New Event page 
appears in Edit mode. (See Chapter 5 to see how to complete a new 
event record.)
»
» View an event record. If you see a listed event, click the link. A page appears 
with details on the activity.
»
» Drill into your schedule. Click a date on the calendar to drill into your 
schedule for a specific day. The Day View page appears.
»
» Schedule a group activity. Click the Multi User View icon (which looks like 
two little people). A page appears for the selected day that displays the 
availability of multiple users. From there, click the New Event button and 
follow the same instructions for scheduling a new event, as described in detail 
in Chapter 5.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      29
Tracking your tasks
On the home page, you see a section entitled My Tasks, which displays tasks that 
you created for yourself or that have been assigned to you.
A task is an activity that you need to do, and it can have a due date. Unlike an event, 
however, a task doesn’t have a specific time and duration. For example, if you 
want to remind yourself to send a proposal, you typically create a task instead of 
scheduling an event. (See Chapter 5 for additional tips on managing tasks.)
From the My Tasks section (shown in Figure 3-4), you can do the following:
»
» Add a new task. Click the New button, and a New Task page appears in 
Edit mode.
»
» Change task view. Use the drop-down list at the top right of the My Tasks 
section to select from a list of common task views. For example, select 
Overdue to see your open tasks that are past their respective due dates.
»
» Review a task. Click a link in the Subject column to review a task. A task 
record appears with details.
»
» Go to associated records. Click links in the Name column, the Related To 
column, or the Account column.
»
» Complete the task and enter any details before saving. Click the X link in 
the Complete column. You can also use this link to update a task, but if you 
haven’t completed the task, remember to adjust the Status field before you 
save it.
»
» See more tasks. If you have several tasks in your list, the View More link 
appears at the bottom of the My Tasks section on the home page. Click it to 
see more tasks on the list. The Day View appears, and the My Tasks section 
appears in the right column.
FIGURE 3-3:  
Looking over your 
calendar options.

30      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Using dashboard snapshots  
from the home page
If your company has customized your home page, you may also see and select up 
to three key charts or tables from your dashboards. Dashboards display important 
information from reports in Salesforce that can provide key performance indica-
tors on the health of your business. Each dashboard chart or table is composed of 
at least one component. (See Chapter 24 for details on building dashboards that can 
measure and analyze your business.) As of this writing, dashboards are available 
in the Group, Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited editions.
If you see a chart or table on your home page, you can also perform these actions 
from the Dashboard section:
»
» Click a chart or table to drill into the detail. A report page appears with the 
data that supports the graphic.
»
» Choose a different dashboard. Click the Customize Page button at the upper 
right of the section. The Customize Your Home Page page appears; here, you 
can select from available dashboards if you have the proper administrator 
permissions. Your home page displays a snapshot of only the three compo-
nents along the top of any dashboard.
»
» Refresh the dashboard snapshot. Click the Refresh button at the top of the 
section. In the left of the section, a date and timestamp appear showing when 
your dashboard was last refreshed.
Accessing information with the sidebar
The sidebar is the column on the left that appears on just about every page of 
Salesforce except for dashboards and reports. On the home page, use the sidebar 
to quickly go back to pages you recently accessed, stay informed about important 
company messages, click links to useful websites, and create new records.
Creating new records
Use the compact Create New picklist on the sidebar to quickly create any new 
record.
FIGURE 3-4:  
Reviewing the My 
Tasks section on 
the home page.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      31
Revisiting recent items
The Recent Items section displays up to ten records that you most recently clicked. 
Use the list to quickly get back to records that you’ve been working on, even if you 
logged out and logged back in. The recent items show an icon and the name or 
number of the record. These items include mostly the records that are organized 
under a tab heading, such as Accounts, Contacts, and so on. To visit the detail 
record of a recent item, simply click a listed link.
Getting more out of your home page sidebar
With the help of your administrator, you can offer other tools and information 
from the sidebar on the home page to improve productivity and drive overall 
adoption. Review the following tips, see Chapter 17 on customizing Salesforce, and 
consult with your administrator if Custom Components could help your 
organization:
»
» Display company messages. Your administrator can add a section to the 
home page that displays text to keep users informed of important announce-
ments. For example, if you’re in sales management, you may want to use the 
home page to alert reps to end-of-quarter goals or bonus incentives.
»
» Emphasize important custom links. If you rely on other websites to carry 
out part of your work, your administrator can help you post them for all your 
users or just ones that fit certain profiles. For example, if you have a company 
intranet, your company can add a custom component that is a link to that 
internal website, and insert it on the Salesforce home page.
If you’d rather not have the sidebar take up some of your browser window’s hori-
zontal real estate, Salesforce allows you to hide and expand the sidebar when you 
want. Your administrator can set up this option by choosing Setup ➪ Build ➪  
Customize ➪ User Interface and clicking the Enable Collapsible Sidebar check box.
Navigating the Apps
Salesforce allows you to organize tabs into groups. These groups, also known as 
apps, help reduce screen clutter and give you quicker access to the tabs that you 
use the most. For example, a marketing manager may rarely use the Cases or 
Opportunities tabs but spend most of her time looking at Campaigns and Leads.
With the Salesforce.com Force.com platform, your company can now create cus-
tom apps for more specific uses within customer relationship management 

32      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
(CRM)  — or for anything else, for that matter. Sales reps can use an expense 
reporting app, and product managers can use a product release app to manage 
their product requirements. The mind-blowing part of all of this is that apps can 
be composed of standard tabs or custom ones that you create. Anyone in your com-
pany can benefit from sharing one set of data. And don’t worry if you’re not the 
most creative type. Salesforce.com has a bunch of prebuilt apps available (for free 
or for an additional charge), which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 19.
Discovering the app menu
In the upper-right corner of any Salesforce page, you can find the app menu (see 
Figure 3-5). The drop-down list allows you to switch between apps. You find some 
standard tab groupings, such as Sales and Call Center. Administrators can also add 
or create new apps to address what their specific users need to see. Don’t worry if 
you choose an app and see new tabs. You can always go back to the drop-down 
list, select your previous app, and have your familiar tabs return.
Uncovering the App Launcher
From the app menu, selecting the App Launcher option takes you to the App 
Launcher page where all your apps are now displayed as clickable tiles, as shown 
in Figure 3-6. Clicking a tile is the same as selecting that app in the app menu, as 
described in the immediately prior section. Depending on what other systems 
your company has integrated with Salesforce, you may also see installed app icons 
for other applications used at your company, like Gmail or Concur.
Finding out about the tabs
In this section, we describe the major tabs in Salesforce and show you how to use 
the tab home pages to quickly access, manage, or organize information.
FIGURE 3-5:  
Choosing apps by 
using the Force.
com app menu.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      33
Each tab within Salesforce represents a major module or data element in an inter-
connected database. That’s as technical as we get.
In the following list, we briefly describe each of the standard tabs (as shown in 
Figure 3-7). We devote a chapter to each of the tabs mentioned here:
»
» Chatter (see Chapter 6): Manage all aspects of your collaboration efforts 
here. From the Chatter home page, you can view all updates to your feed, as 
well as search for people and groups to follow. If you don’t see this tab, you 
may not have Chatter enabled in your organization.
»
» Campaigns (see Chapter 15): Specific marketing efforts that you manage to 
drive leads, build a brand, or stimulate demand.
»
» Leads (see Chapter 7): Suspects (people and companies with whom you 
want to do business). But don’t start grilling your lead about where she was on 
the morning of July 23, because the only clue you’ll gather is the sound of a 
dial tone.
»
» Accounts (see Chapter 8): Companies with whom you currently do or 
previously did business. You can track all types of accounts, including 
customers, prospects, former customers, partners, and competitors.
»
» Contacts (see Chapter 9): Individuals associated with your accounts.
»
» Opportunities (see Chapter 10): The deals that you pursue to track transac-
tions or drive revenue for your company. Your open opportunities constitute 
your pipeline, and opportunities can contribute to your forecast.
»
» Products (see Chapter 11): Your company’s products and services, associ-
ated with the prices for which you offer them. You can aggregate different 
products and their prices to your opportunities.
FIGURE 3-6:

34      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
»
» Cases (see Chapter 13): Customer inquiries that your support teams work on 
to manage and resolve.
»
» Content (see Chapter 18): The sales and marketing collateral and documents 
that you use as part of your selling or service processes.
»
» Reports (see Chapter 23): Data analyses for you and your entire organiza-
tion. Salesforce provides a variety of best practices reports, and you can build 
custom reports on the fly to better measure your business.
»
» Dashboards (see Chapter 24): Graphs, charts, and tables based on your 
custom reports. You can use dashboards to visually measure and analyze key 
elements of your business.
Discovering a tab home page
When you click a tab, the tab’s interior home page appears. For example, if you 
click the Accounts tab, the Accounts home page appears. The tab’s home page is 
where you can view, organize, track, and maintain all the records within that tab.
Do this right now: Click every tab visible to you.
The look and feel of the interior home pages never change, regardless of which tab 
you click (except for the Home, Reports, and Dashboards tabs). On the left, you 
have the sidebar with the Create New drop-down list, Recent Items, and (depend-
ing on your company and the tab) a Quick Create tool. In the body of the page, you 
have a View drop-down list, a Recent Items section related to whichever tab you’re 
on (for example, Recent Accounts), and sections for popular Reports and Tools 
(see Figure 3-8).
Using the View drop-down list
Strategy and execution are all about focus. With custom list views, you can see and 
use lists to better focus on your business. A list view is a segment of the tab’s 
records based on defined criteria. When you select a list view, a list of records 
appears based on your criteria.
FIGURE 3-7:  
Navigating 
through the tabs.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      35
On each tab, Salesforce provides a selection of popular default views to get you 
started. To try a list view (using Accounts as the example), follow these steps 
(which apply to all tabs):
1.	 Click the Accounts tab.
The Accounts home page appears (refer to Figure 3-8).
2.	 Select My Accounts from the View drop-down list.
A list page appears that displays a set of columns representing certain 
standard account fields and a list of your account records. If no account 
records appear, you don’t own any in Salesforce.
3.	 From the list page, you can perform a variety of functions:
•	 Re-sort the list. Click a column header. For example, if you click the Account 
Name header, the list sorts alphabetically, as shown in Figure 3-9.
•	 View records beginning with a certain letter. Click that letter link above the list 
to view those records.
If a user sorts by a column other than name, the letter search looks for 
values in that column starting with the selected letter. For example, if sort-
ing by State, selecting C filters for accounts with states starting with C 
rather than account names starting with C.
•	 Display fewer or more records on the page. Use the Display Records per Page 
picklist on the bottom left of the page to show more or less records. 
Additionally, the Next Page link takes you to the next set of records.
•	 View a specific record. Click the link for that record in the Account Name 
column. The Account detail page appears, displaying the record and its 
related lists.
•	 Update a specific record. Click the Edit link at the beginning of its row. The 
account record appears in Edit mode.
FIGURE 3-8:  
Deconstructing 
the tab home 
page.

36      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
•	 Delete a record. Click the Del link near the beginning of that record’s row. 
A pop-up window appears, prompting you to click OK to accept the 
deletion. If you click OK, the list page reappears, minus the account that 
you just wiped out. Don’t worry — in Chapter 5, in the “Resurrecting 
records from the Recycle Bin” section, we show you how to bring recently 
deleted records back to life.
•	 Follow this record. If you have Chatter enabled, you’ll see a green circle with 
a white plus sign (+) in it to the right of the Del link. Clicking this plus sign 
changes the green circle to a blue checkmark that signifies that you are now 
following that record. Any updates, modifications, or discussions made on 
that record will show up in your Chatter feed so you can stay informed.
Building a custom list view
If you have a particular way that you like to look at records, you can build a custom 
list view. If you have the right permissions, you can share this view with other 
groups or your entire organization. (Or maybe you should just keep your views to 
yourself.)
To create a custom list view (using Contacts as the example), follow these steps 
(which apply to all tabs):
1.	 Click the Contacts tab.
The Contacts home page appears.
2.	 To the right of the View drop-down list, click the Create New View link.
A Create New View page appears.
FIGURE 3-9:  
Re-sorting a list.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      37
3.	 Name the view by typing a title in the View Name field.
For example, if you want to create a list of your contacts that are senior 
executives, use a title like My Senior Execs.
4.	 Select whether you want to search All Contacts or just My Contacts by 
selecting one of the two radio buttons.
In this example, select the My Contacts radio button.
5.	 Type the campaign name into the Campaign Name field.
For this running example, assume that your marketing manager created 
campaigns. You may want to tie a campaign to filter your List View after 
identifying which contacts you want the view to search.
Tying a campaign to your List View filters your results to those contacts related 
to a specific marketing campaign. You must have the proper permissions in 
the Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited editions for this capability.
6.	 (Optional) Below the Filter by Additional Fields heading, enter search criteria.
A basic criteria query is made up of three elements:
•	 Field: The leftmost box is a drop-down list of all the fields on the contact 
record. In this example, choose Title.
•	 Operator: The middle box is a drop-down list of operators for your search. 
That sounds complicated, but it’s easier than you think. For this example, 
select the Contains option.
•	 Value: In the rightmost box, type the value that you want in the search. In 
this example, you might type vp, vice president, ceo, cio, or cto.
7.	 Select the columns that you want to have displayed by selecting a value from 
the drop-down lists in some or all of the fields provided.
Although Salesforce’s preset views have common fields, such as Phone and 
Email, you can select any of up to 15 fields to display on your custom view page.
8.	 Decide whether you want others to see your custom view.
Administrators and certain users have this permission. Your decision is made 
simple if the step doesn’t appear. Otherwise, select one of the three options. 
(Basically, the three radio buttons translate to none, all, or selective.) If you 
choose the third option, use the drop-down list to select a group and then click 
the arrows to move that group into the Shared To column.
9.	 Click Save.
A new list view appears based on your custom criteria. If you don’t get all the 
results that you anticipate, double-check and refine the filter criteria. For 
­example, if your list should include directors but doesn’t, click the Edit link and 
update the view.

38      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
As long as you save your custom list view, you can use it later from the Views 
menu. To reduce list view clutter, be considerate and lean toward saving list views 
that are visible only to yourself. Otherwise, you risk flooding your public list view 
with several similar-but-slightly-different views that aren’t culled over time.
Reviewing the Recent Items section
On a tab’s home page, just below the views, you see a Recent Items section. (The 
name of the item will match whatever type of record you’re on. For example, 
Recent Accounts is the section name if you’re on the Accounts tab.) This section 
comes with three or four relevant columns that you can modify. You can see as few 
as 10 items and as many as 25 items at a time by clicking the link at the bottom of 
the table.
To test the Recent Items section (by using Leads as the example), go to the Leads 
home page and follow these steps (which you can apply to all tabs):
1.	 In the Recent Leads section, select an option from the drop-down list at 
the upper-right corner of the table.
The table reappears with changes based on what you select.
2.	 Click a link in the table to go to a record.
The detail page appears, displaying the record and related lists.
3.	 At any time, click the New button in the upper middle of the table to create a 
new lead record.
A New Lead page appears in Edit mode, ready and waiting. (See Chapter 7 to 
read more about the fields in the Lead record.)
Reviewing common reports
In the lower-left corner of a tab’s home page, Salesforce displays a small selection 
of commonly used reports associated with that tab. You can click a link to go 
directly to the report or click the Go to Reports link, which takes you to the Reports 
home page.
Tooling through the Tools section
In the lower portion of a tab’s home page, Salesforce provides a set of unique tools 
associated with a particular tab. Depending on which tab you’re viewing, use these 
tools to help you manage and maintain records within that tab. For example, on 
the Accounts home page, in the Tools section, you can click the Merge Accounts 
link to merge duplicate accounts. See the related chapters later in this book for 
details on using specific tools.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      39
Explaining the Lightning Experience
Late in 2015, Salesforce.com debuted a revamped user experience in Salesforce, 
called Lightning Experience. It was based on extensive user research and provides 
a look and feel that better prepares new users for an experience that’s effective 
across multiple access methods. Salesforce users are no longer just using a com-
puter and web browser to access their company’s version of Salesforce. An 
increasingly mobile sales force now needs to get its work done while updating 
Salesforce from a smartphone or tablet, too.
In this section, we discuss how the Lightning Experience affects information in 
this book, and some fundamental updates in its new interface.
Approaching the Lightning  
Experience in this book
Thankfully, with the Lightning Experience, Salesforce.com realized that its exist-
ing customer base of hundreds of thousands of users needed to feel warm and 
fuzzy about the new user interface (UI) before choosing to adopt it. Salesforce 
users will remain on the UI referred to as Salesforce Classic, and have ample ways 
to test out whether the Lightning Experience is right for their organization before 
enabling it across the organization.
In this book, we continue to discuss the existing UI, which Salesforce.com refers 
to as Salesforce Classic, since the majority of Salesforce users are still on that UI. 
Our screenshots are taken in Salesforce Classic, unless otherwise noted. At the 
time of this publication, the Lightning Experience does not yet fully support all 
features and behaviors available in Salesforce Classic.
Existing customers can choose to enable and switch to the Lightning Experience 
when they’re comfortable and ready. Even then, Salesforce.com allows a user to 
switch back and forth between the Salesforce Classic UI and the Lightning Experi-
ence UI.
Make sure you read the fine print in the Salesforce release notes (http://docs.
releasenotes.salesforce.com) to thoroughly understand what features are and 
are not yet supported in the Lightning Experience. With three releases a year, the 
list of supported features will only grow. Also make sure you understand Light-
ning Experience’s impact on your users by testing business processes out in a 
sandbox environment before turning this on.

40      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Reviewing Lightning Experience  
fundamentals
In this section, we discuss the most visible changes between the Salesforce Classic 
UI and the Lightning Experience UI. Read on to get familiar with basic changes so 
you can start assessing where your organization may or may not yet be ready to 
make a change.
Summarizing the home page in  
the Lightning Experience
The home page in the Lightning Experience has been re-envisioned to empower a 
salesperson to more efficiently manage his day in Salesforce.
Make sure to familiarize yourself with the following home page concepts, as 
shown in Figure 3-10:
»
» Quarterly Performance chart: Designed for people using opportunities to 
track their sales performance, this chart appears prominently on the home 
page. A rep can add her goal for the quarter and quickly see how close she is 
to hitting this quarter’s target. Opportunities with close dates this quarter that 
are already closed or with probability of greater than 70 percent will 
show up here.
The chart is also interactive. Hovering over it can reveal specific opportunities 
with close dates in this quarter. Clicking the corresponding blue dot opens a 
pop-up window with some additional opportunity details, so a sales rep can 
quickly prioritize her work.
»
» Assistant: The right-hand column of your screen now displays a combination 
of overdue and open tasks with some details, as well as leads assigned to you 
and activities related to opportunities that should matter to you.
»
» Account Insights: Below the Quarterly Performance chart is an area that has 
news about your accounts, its executives, and industries that your accounts 
are in. The news is curated from Data.com and other third parties.
»
» Top Deals: This section shows a list of your biggest open opportunities.
The importance of maintaining accurate and clean data in your company’s Sales-
force instance is reflected in these new features. Garbage data in results in gar-
bage data out. It’s never too late to instill a culture of data discipline in your 
organization, so your sales team can take advantage of clean data in outsmarting 
and being more productive than the competition’s sales force.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      41
Here are the key UI differences between the Lightning Experience and Salesforce 
Classic:
»
» Tabs have been replaced by a navigation bar. Gone are the tabs across the 
top of page, which have been replaced by a collapsible navigation bar on the 
left, as shown in Figure 3-10. Words next to new icons are similar to tab 
names in the Salesforce Classic view. To maximize horizontal screen real 
estate, when you’re used to identifying which icons represent which records, 
you can collapse the navigation bar by clicking the topmost icon, which looks 
like a set of three horizontal lines.
»
» The app menu has been replaced by the App Launcher. Instead of going to 
a drop-down in the upper-right corner of the screen to switch between 
clusters of tabs as you do in Salesforce Classic, you click the icon that looks 
like a 3 x 3 grid of little squares, as shown in Figure 3-11. Hovering over that 
icon changes it from boring gray squares to colored ones. Clicking the icon 
results in the App Launcher page showing. Different from Salesforce Classic, if 
you click a tile, you’re taken to a new page that shows all records (or “items”) 
associated with that app. The page also specifies which objects are not yet 
supported in the Lightning Experience, which means if you click it, it’ll go back 
to the Salesforce Classic UI.
»
» The Setup link has been replaced by a gear icon. System administrators 
need to click the gear icon with a lightning bolt in it (shown in Figure 3-12), to 
get to their familiar Setup area, which is now called Setup Home.

Launcher.

42      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
»
» Calendar, Chatter feed, Dashboard view, and My Tasks have been moved 
off the home page. These sections of the old standard home page are no 
longer on the Lightning Experience home page. They’re still accessible via the 
navigation bar on the left.
Getting to records in the Lightning Experience
To get to a record, find its equivalent object icon in the navigation bar and click the 
icon, as shown in Figure 3-13. If it’s not there, use the App Launcher to click the 
corresponding app’s tile, and then locate a specific object name to click. Clicking 
the object name from the navigation bar results in a page displaying a list view of 
the most recently viewed objects. You can then change this to a custom list view 
by clicking the little triangle to the right of the Recently Viewed picklist name. 
Select your record from the list of items returned.
Navigating a record in the Lightning Experience
When you’re looking at a record, realize that the Lightning Experience is meant to 
reduce the vertical scrolling that is predominant in the Salesforce Classic UI. The 
elements of the old UI still exist; they’ve just moved around.
Here are some common changes that occur on a new Lightning Experience record 
page, as shown in Figure 3-14:
FIGURE 3-12:  
Getting to the 
Setup Home.
FIGURE 3-13:  
Getting to the 
Account record.

CHAPTER 3  Navigating Salesforce      43
» Standard fields are summarized at the top of the page. The top part of a 
record displays standard field information. When scrolling down, the record 
name is anchored so you never forget which record you’re seeing 
details about.
» The Edit and New Record buttons are shifted to the right. Edit and Delete 
buttons still exist. They’re just offset a bit to the right. If you can’t see one of 
your buttons listed, click the little triangle to the right of existing buttons, to 
see a list of additional ones.
» Related lists appear as cards. For some objects, this appears in the middle 
part of the record, below the record header. For other objects, related lists 
appear on the right-hand side. They all take the form of cards, where a few 
fields are exposed to give people some context around that record.
» Activity buttons have been changed to subtabs in the Activity subsec-
tion. For some objects, the Activity subsection appears in the middle part of 
the record, below the header. For other objects, the Activity area is in the 
right-hand column. The Salesforce Classic buttons are gone, replaced by 
subtabs that still allow you to log a call, or create a new task, event, or email.
» Record details have been moved to the new Details subsection. This is 
meant to both reduce the amount of vertical scrolling, while also allowing you 
to quickly get to additional fields on your record. Custom links also appear 
here.
» The Chatter feed is nested in the new Collaborate subsection. You’ll see 
all the posts from your Chatter feed here, related to whatever record you’re 
on. You’ll be able to post a comment, share a link, or create a poll just as you 
did before, under respective subtabs. Again, this helps reduce the vertical 
scrolling on a record.

Working with Salesforce on the go
Personalizing 
Salesforce
S
alesforce was built by salespeople for salespeople. The tool had to be simple 
to use, relevant to the business of selling, and customizable so that you 
could use it to do your job more effectively.
The My Profile page captures information that you want your colleagues to see 
about yourself, to improve collaboration across your company. Think of it as a 
directory listing for everyone who works in Salesforce.
From the My Settings page (formerly known as the Personal Setup page), you can 
personalize details of your application to better suit the way you look at and man-
age your daily tasks. And if you capitalize on the tools available in Salesforce, you 
can give yourself an edge against the competition and your peers.
In this chapter, we describe how to update your personal information in My Profile, 
modify your settings by using My Settings, change your display, and access Sales-
force anytime, anywhere.
Chapter 4

46      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Completing the My Profile Page
The My Profile page acts like a cross between a corporate intranet page about 
yourself and a news feed about your collaborations within the company. Later, we 
talk more about Chatter and how the concept of feeds appears in many places in 
Salesforce. For now, think of feeds as proactive status updates across your com-
pany so that people interested in the same things (like an account, contact, or 
opportunity) can follow each other and stay up to date on the latest news.
To locate and update your My Profile page, follow these steps:
1.	 After logging in to Salesforce, click your name in the upper-right corner of 
the Salesforce page and select the My Profile list option.
Your profile page appears. In the left column is room for a photo, some contact 
details, and some statistics based on various interactions on the feed. The feed 
is the middle column that shows your most recent activities (similar to a feed 
on a social network). An overview about yourself, and what Chatter groups 
you belong to, is accessible from the Overview tab to the right of the Feed tab 
(see Figure 4-1).
2.	 To upload a photo, click the outline of the head in the left column, and then 
click Upload.
The Upload Profile Photo box appears.
3.	 Click the Browse button to upload a small square photo of yourself.
A file selection window opens so that you can browse to and select your photo 
from your computer.
FIGURE 4-1:  
Reviewing the My 
Profile page.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      47
Though you may prefer to submit a photo of your pet (as we did) or the 
back of your head, don’t forget that this is for work collaboration. Help your 
fellow employees out (especially the newer ones) by posting a clear photo of 
yourself.
4.	 After you’ve clicked your photo file, click Open.
5.	 Click Save on the Upload Profile Photo screen.
Voilà! Your photo appears. A smaller version of your photo will now appear to 
the left of your name within any Chatter feeds so that you can be quickly 
­identified.
Now, to update your contact information so that people know a little more about 
you, follow these steps:
1.	 To the right of the Contact heading, click the pencil icon.
The Edit Profile page appears. The email associated with your Salesforce 
account appears, along with other contact information. Complete what you 
feel is necessary for co-workers who need to reach you.
2.	 Click the About tab on the Edit Profile page.
Update information here to give your co-workers some more background 
about yourself.
3.	 Click Save All when done.
The updates are now reflected on the My Profile page.
This profile page is especially helpful for companies with users who aren’t all in 
the same location.
Using the My Settings Menu
My Settings, which you access by clicking your name after you’ve logged in to 
Salesforce, is the enhanced user interface for what used be called the Personal 
Setup page. In fact, if you don’t see My Settings after clicking your name, your 
organization probably signed up for Salesforce prior to this feature’s existence 
and the administrator hasn’t opted to enable it yet (more on that later). You can 
still follow along and update your settings, because this is largely a visual update 
to what was the old Personal Setup page.
My Settings is a set of tools and options that you can use to customize Salesforce 
according to your individual preferences. You can decide to show only certain tabs, 

48      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
synchronize your Salesforce data with your email program, set how often you 
want to get Chatter updates, and work with Salesforce while you’re not connected 
to the Internet.
Salesforce makes it easy for you to better personalize your system by providing all 
your setup tools in one area.
To locate and navigate your My Settings area, follow these steps:
1.	 Click your name in the upper-right corner of any page, and select the My 
Settings option from the drop-down list.
The My Settings page appears, and you see a Quick Links and Desktop 
Add-Ons section (depending on your permissions), as shown in Figure 4-2.
If you didn’t find a My Settings link below your name, don’t worry. This just 
means that you’re on the old user interface. You can still follow along by 
clicking your name, then selecting the Setup option in the drop-down list, and 
then clicking the Personal Setup link in the left sidebar.
The My Settings page lists each of its main headings in an expandable sidebar. 
The Quick Links in the body of the page and the sidebar work hand in hand, 
but we like to use the sidebar so that we don’t get lost.
2.	 Click each of the section headings to expand them and see the full range of 
options (see Figure 4-3).
Subsections appear. The body of the page doesn’t change if you simply expand 
the section within the sidebar.
FIGURE 4-2:  
Looking over the 
My Settings page.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      49
3.	 Click any subsection.
The details for that subsection appear.
4.	 Click the Back button in your browser to return to the previous page, or click 
another section heading to open that heading’s page.
You’ve mastered basic navigation on the My Settings menu.
Modifying Your Personal Information
By expanding the Personal heading, you can keep your user record current, set 
preferences, and customize your display to suit your tastes.
Updating your user information
In Salesforce, you have a user record that corresponds to you. You can use that 
record to keep other users up to date on your contact information.
FIGURE 4-3:  
Expanding the 
sections.

50      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
To find out how to navigate to the My Settings area, see the preceding section.
To modify your user record, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Personal heading on the sidebar (refer to Figure 4-2).
A series of options appears below the heading.
2.	 Click the Personal Information link.
Details of your user record appears in Edit mode. Review the accuracy of your 
personal information and update it.
Especially if you travel frequently, make sure that you update your time zone 
both in Salesforce and on your laptop, reflecting your current location. This is 
particularly important if you’re managing your schedule and synchronizing 
with offline tools, such as Outlook.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
Your user record appears again with the updated information.
Changing your display
If you log in and feel as if you really need only a fraction of the tabs or a select 
number of related lists, you can customize your display. Your administrator can 
still override your personal setup, if necessary — for example, after installing an 
AppExchange application that comes with additional tabs.
Salesforce already provides many standard tabs and groups some of them into 
apps that you choose from the Force.com app menu. Companies can also create 
their own tabs. Most users just don’t need to see all those tabs at the same time.
To customize your tabs, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Display & Layout heading on the My Settings sidebar (refer to 
Figure 4-3).
The Display & Layout heading expands.
2.	 Click the Customize My Tabs link if you want to add, remove, or change the 
order of your tabs within an app.
The Customize My Tabs page appears.
3.	 Select which app’s tab set you want to customize from the Custom App 
drop-down list.
The default Selected Tabs list changes when you change the Custom App 
selection. Salesforce pregroups its tabs into several standard apps for various 

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      51
common business functions. Depending on your business, having these tabs 
visible may be perfect, or you may want to see more or fewer tabs.
4.	 Use the Add or Remove arrow buttons to highlight a tab and then add it to or 
remove it from your display, respectively, as shown in Figure 4-4.
For example, if you’re in marketing and spend most of your time with leads, 
you may decide to add the Campaigns tab and remove the Customizable 
Forecasts tab from your Sales custom app.
5.	 Use the up and down arrows to change the order of the tabs.
The only exception is that you can’t move or remove the Home tab.
6.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The My Settings page reappears, and your tabs reflect your changes.
Customizing pages
You can also personalize your display by changing the layout on a record page. 
Doing so enables you to see the most relevant sections first. For example, if you 
work in a call center, you may want to see cases at the top of your related lists on 
an account page.
FIGURE 4-4:  
Modifying your 
tabs.

52      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
To customize the display of a page, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Display & Layout heading on the My Settings sidebar (refer to 
Figure 4-3).
The Display & Layout section expands on the sidebar.
2.	 Go to the Customize My Pages subsection and select a specific tab that you 
want to modify (the Accounts tab, for example). Then click the Customize 
Page button.
The Customize My Page page appears for the tab you selected.
3.	 Select a list item from either of the two list boxes, depending on whether you 
want to add or remove it from your page.
For example, if you sell directly to customers, you may want to remove the 
Partners related list from the Account’s Selected List column.
4.	 Use the up and down arrows to change the order of how the items will 
appear on your page layout.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Customize My Pages page reappears.
Setting up social accounts and contacts
If researching a person’s or company’s background is a large part of your job, 
Salesforce saves you some mouse clicks by letting you quickly see the social pro-
files associated with accounts, contacts, leads, and person accounts right from 
that particular record.
To activate viewing of social accounts and contacts, follow these steps:
1.	 From the My Settings page, click the Display & Layout heading.
The Display & Layout section expands to show its subsections.
2.	 Click the My Social Accounts and Contacts subsection.
The My Social Accounts and Contacts detail page appears.
3.	 Make sure that the Use Social Accounts and Contacts check box is selected.
A list of social networks appears. If you have a LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook 
account, this will allow you to later sign in to those social networks from  
within Salesforce, to see profiles for the people and companies that you’re 
researching.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      53
4.	 Select any check boxes next to the social networks that you’d like to have 
enabled (see Figure 4-5).
Don’t worry, the ability to see an account’s or contact’s social network informa-
tion is available only to the individual Salesforce user who enables this for 
himself. Your colleagues will need to enable this for themselves, and have 
accounts to those social networks, if they want to take advantage of this 
feature.
After Social Accounts and Contacts is enabled, you’ll only be able to see as much 
as your account on that social network allows you to see, and what the person or 
company that you’re looking at wants you to see.
Granting login access
When you need help from your administrator, Salesforce.com customer support, 
or customer support from a third-party AppExchange package that was installed 
in your organization, you can grant any of these folks temporary login access to 
your account. By gaining access to your account, the person helping you can 
­provide better assistance from your perspective, because she can view your pages 
as you do.
To grant login access, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Grant Account Login Access subheading from the Personal 
section of the My Settings page (refer to Figure 4-3).
The Grant Account Login Access page appears.
FIGURE 4-5:  
Selecting your 
social networks.

54      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
2.	 Grant support and/or administrator access for a duration of up to  
one year by selecting the appropriate time frame from the Access  
Duration picklist.
Your administrator, Salesforce.com support, or the AppExchange vendor’s 
support contact will be able to log in as you through the expiration date.
3.	 When you’re done, click the Save button.
The My Settings page appears.
If you’re an administrator and a user has granted you access, you can log in to the 
user’s account as follows: Below the Manage Users heading on the Setup sidebar, 
click the Users link and then select the Active Users picklist view. From the list of 
users displayed, click the Login link to the left of the user’s name.
Setting Up Salesforce1 for Your Mobile 
Device
It feels like a given that any application you frequently use will also be accessible 
from your mobile device. Whether you’re flying to Hong Kong for an important 
meeting and need to update critical information on your tablet, or you’re in a cab 
looking up a contact’s address on your phone, Salesforce1 was built with the user 
in mind to accomplish these tasks.
Downloading and installing Salesforce1
In today’s world of tablets and mobile devices, you can be anywhere and access 
Salesforce. To best experience Salesforce from your mobile device, find the 
­Salesforce1 app in the iTunes App Store (if you’re an iPhone user) or the Google 
Play marketplace (if you’re on the Android operating system). They’re free to 
download and you get instant access to your most-viewed accounts, contacts, 
opportunities, cases, leads, and any other custom tabs specific to your company.
The downloadable Salesforce1 app is not supported on the BlackBerry; however, 
some BlackBerry users (Z10 and Z30 phones) can still access the mobile browser app.
To download and install Salesforce1 on iOS via the App Store, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home screen of your iPhone or iPad, select the App Store icon.
The App Store home page appears.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      55
2.	 In the Search field, type Salesforce1.
A list of search results appears.
3.	 Select the Salesforce1 app in the list of search results.
The Salesforce1 app page appears.
4.	 Tap Free and then tap Install to install the app.
You may have to enter your iTunes account and password for the download 
to begin.
The download begins and finishes, and the app appears on your home screen.
5.	 Select the Salesforce1 icon on your home screen and click I Agree.
You’re prompted to enter your Salesforce account’s username and password.
6.	 Select Login once you’re done to enter Salesforce1 and get started.
Now that you’ve installed Salesforce1 on your device, let’s talk about the configu-
ration options you have to make it your own.
Configuring Salesforce1 for your needs
Much of Salesforce1 at this point is just enabling it for your users and organiza-
tion. However, there are a few things you can customize and tweak to make it easy 
and efficient to work in the field. You can define the users who can access Sales-
force1, customize how data appears in it, create actions to add new records, and 
tweak it to make it match the look and feel of your company’s branding. Let’s look 
at how to find and accomplish some of these configurations.
Salesforce makes this customization simple by giving administrators the Sales-
force1 Wizard, which guides users with step-by-step customization options to 
make sure admins don’t overlook any features.
To start configuring Salesforce1, navigate to the Setup menu, and follow these steps:
1.	 Click Salesforce1 Quick Start from the menu’s left-hand sidebar 
(see Figure 4-6).
The Salesforce1 Setup page appears.
2.	 Click the Launch Quick Start Wizard button.
The Quick Start Wizard page appears.

56      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
3.	 Click Let’s Get Started.
In the first step, you can set up the left-hand navigation menu for your users 
in the Salesforce1 mobile app. You can reorder or remove items using a 
drag-and-drop interface.
4.	 Click Save and Next to move onto arranging your Global Actions.
Global Actions allow users to create new records quickly and easily, but these 
records aren’t tied to any other records in Salesforce. For example, an 
­opportunity record won’t be automatically tied to an account record. For more 
information above global actions and how to create them, see Chapter 17.
5.	 Click Save and Next and then Create Compact Layout to move onto 
­creating a compact layout.
The compact layout used by Salesforce1 determines which key fields will be 
displayed at the top of the record detail display on the app. For example, you 
can choose to display a contact’s name, email, and phone number at the top of 
your contact records in Salesforce1 for quick viewing.
6.	 When you’re finished, click Save and Next to preview your basic configura-
tion thus far.
Here you can look at different aspects of your configuration and see a 
simulation of the mobile app.
FIGURE 4-6:

Salesforce1 Quick 
Start menu.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      57
7.	 After previewing what Salesforce1 will look like, click Next to invite some 
pilot users to take a test drive and give you feedback.
This page allows you to email those users directly. Start typing their names in 
the To field and, if they exist in Salesforce, they’ll be suggested as you type 
(see Figure 4-7).
8.	 Click Send and then Finish when you’re done.
Congratulations! The basic setup of Salesforce1 is complete and you’re taken 
back to the setup menu. Now you can configure some other aspects of the 
app, such as in-app or push notifications, the appearance and branding of the 
app, or user access to it.
Navigating in Salesforce1
The Salesforce1 application is very easy to navigate and was designed in a way that 
is similar to many other apps you probably use. Let’s look at a few navigation tips 
and tools to get you well on your way to using the app like a pro.
The Salesforce1 Navigation menu is where you should begin. You can toggle the 
navigation menu by selecting the menu icon on the top left of the app (see 
Figure 4-8).
The Navigation menu is customizable, so if the default configuration doesn’t meet 
your organization’s needs, you can change the items that appear and the order in 
which they do.
FIGURE 4-7:  
Inviting pilot 
users to try 
Salesforce1 and 
provide feedback.

58      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
You can select the items that will always appear at the top of the menu, such as 
tasks or dashboards. This is called the selected list. The first item you choose for the 
Selected list will be the landing page for the app. In other words, that’s what users 
will first see when they log in.
Keep user adoption in mind when setting up your Navigation menu. Put the items 
that users will use most often at the top of the list, because the Navigation menu 
is not user-specific and the entire organization will see the same Selected list.
Under the Selected list, you see a Recent list, which shows you the most recent 
objects you’ve accessed, either on the browser or mobile version of Salesforce.
Finally, the last section is the Apps menu.
Anything that is represented as a tab in Salesforce can be visible to a user in the 
Navigation menu. Users can only see the tabs and items in the Navigation menu 
that they have permission to access via their Salesforce profiles.
To customize Salesforce1 navigation, go to the full site, and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Mobile Administration ➪ Salesforce Navigation.
The Chatter Settings page appears.
2.	 Use the Add and Remove arrows to move the items you want into or out of 
the Selected column. Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of 
the items in the list.
The item named Smart Search Items becomes your Recent list (discussed 
earlier) and expands into multiple items that you’ve recently accessed. 
FIGURE 4-8:  
Using the 
Salesforce1 
Navigation menu.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      59
Anything above the Smart Search Items element becomes part of the Selected 
list in the menu, and anything below it falls under the Apps list in the menu.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save to save your work.
Your navigation setup is complete! Now you can log in via your mobile device 
to see the changes you’ve made.
There is a great tool that you can download via the Google Chrome Web Store, 
called Salesforce1 Simulator. It displays a large mobile interface on your desktop 
where you can toggle and preview the changes and customizations you’ve made to 
Salesforce1.
Importing Your Contacts
One of the keys to making Salesforce productive for you from day 1 is to get your 
contacts into the system. If your contacts exist primarily in Microsoft Outlook, you 
may be better off synchronizing your data. Otherwise, Salesforce provides easy-
to-use wizards that help you import contacts and accounts. See Chapter 9 for the 
details on importing, and see your administrator if your data goes beyond the 
limits of the Import Wizard. (For example, if you have historical activity linked to 
contacts, you can’t import those records by using standard wizards.)
Working with Salesforce Remotely
For many companies, Microsoft Outlook is a critical piece of the workday: It’s how 
people communicate with customers and schedule meetings. Salesforce lets you 
synchronize with Outlook so that key conversations or meetings in Outlook can be 
reflected and saved in Salesforce. And if you’re a road warrior as well, Salesforce 
provides various ways to log in from your mobile device and close that deal, with-
out having to squint too much looking at that smaller screen.
Salesforce for Outlook is an updated version of what was previously known as 
Connect for Outlook. The new version (and, hence, the name evolution) allows you 
to automatically (or manually — it’s your choice) record Microsoft Outlook emails, 
meetings, and tasks into Salesforce. In the following sections, we show you how 
to install and configure Salesforce for Outlook for your specific synchronization 
needs.

60      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
If you’re the administrator responsible for maintaining accurate data in Sales-
force, encourage your company to adopt Salesforce as the system of record or “the 
single source of truth” for customer interactions. For example, tell users to make 
updates to accounts and contacts in Salesforce rather than in Outlook. Then have 
them configure Salesforce for Outlook to allow Salesforce to win if a data conflict 
occurs between Salesforce and Outlook. By doing this, you can reduce common 
synchronization issues and influence greater Salesforce adoption.
In most cases, installing Salesforce for Outlook is a simple process. If you connect 
to the Internet via a proxy server or if your company has a firewall, you may want 
to consult with your IT department.
To install Salesforce for Outlook, follow these steps:
1.	 From the My Settings page, choose Desktop Add-Ons ➪ Salesforce for 
Outlook on the sidebar.
The Salesforce for Outlook page appears.
2.	 Click the View My Configuration button.
The Salesforce for Outlook configuration that is specific to you appears. It 
shows predetermined settings and objects that will be synchronized. This lets 
you know what is and isn’t going to be syncing with Outlook. And depending on 
your administrator’s configuration, you may be able to modify these settings. 
In case you disagree with the settings, you get to talk with your administrator 
first before you actually sync anything.
3.	 Click the back arrow on your browser and click the Download button on the 
Salesforce for Outlook page.
Salesforce for Outlook is only available for Microsoft Windows operating 
system users.
An executable (.exe) file downloads. Before continuing to Step 4, make sure 
that you’ve closed Outlook on your computer by choosing File ➪ Exit from the 
Outlook toolbar.
4.	 Double-click the executable file to install Salesforce for Outlook.
Select your language, and complete the Installation Wizard.
5.	 Open Microsoft Outlook to complete your Salesforce for Outlook settings.
The Setup Wizard appears.
6.	 After reading the brief welcome message, click Next through the series of 
setup windows.

CHAPTER 4  Personalizing Salesforce      61
7.	At the final window, click the Install button.
When setup is successful, you arrive at the Congratulations screen.
8.	Click the Finish button.
In the lower-right corner of the screen, you should see a small gray logo of 
Salesforce for Outlook. This means that it’s installed and waiting for Microsoft 
Outlook to be opened.
9.	Open Outlook.
A Salesforce for Outlook login window appears. Enter your Salesforce 
­username and password in the appropriate boxes. Then advance to the next 
screen.
10.	Review your synchronization settings.
11.	Click an email to open it.
If the email already exists within your Salesforce organization, the contact or 
lead associated with it will appear in the Salesforce side panel in your Outlook 
window.
12.	If you want to save that email to Salesforce, associated with that contact or 
lead, click the small envelope icon to the right of the person’s name in the 
Salesforce side panel.
The email is now recorded in Salesforce as an activity.
13.	Click Finish.
If you discover that you accidentally deleted records in Salesforce while synchro-
nizing, you can go to your Recycle Bin and restore those records within 15 days 
from the date you deleted the records.

Working in Salesforce
I
n Salesforce, there are common ways that records behave, and there are com-
mon things you can do when you’re on a specific record. Even if different com-
panies use Salesforce for very different business processes, there’s still a 
fundamental commonality of creating a new record, and tracking something 
someone did, in order to get the benefit of collaboration and using Salesforce as a 
source of truth.
By managing activities in Salesforce, for example, you can better coordinate with 
your team, quickly assess what’s going on in your accounts, and focus on the next 
steps to close deals or solve issues.
In this chapter, you find out how to create records, manage your activities, and 
send emails from within Salesforce. Finally, we cover where you can go for help.
Managing Records
By using the Create New drop-down list on the sidebar of any page in Salesforce, 
you can easily add new records into Salesforce. You may find yourself in the posi-
tion of having deleted important files. Don’t worry — Salesforce gives you a way 
to put them back in their rightful spots before anyone notices that they’re 
missing.
Chapter 5

64      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Creating records
To create a record (by using Contacts as the example), follow these steps (which 
can be applied to all Create New Items on the picklist):
1.	 On the home page, select the Contact option on the Create New picklist, 
as shown in Figure 5-1.
A New Contact page appears in Edit mode.
2.	 Complete the fields, as necessary.
Even while you’re in Edit mode, the Create New picklist is available.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Contact detail page appears. Here, you can begin tracking information.
Resurrecting records from the Recycle Bin
Occasionally, you delete a record and regret it. Don’t panic — the Salesforce Recy-
cle Bin gives you 15 days to restore recently deleted records, including any associ-
ated records (such as activities deleted in the process) and your credibility.
FIGURE 5-1:  
Creating records 
by using the 
Create New 
drop-down list.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      65
To restore a deleted record, follow these steps:
1.	 On your sidebar, click the Recycle Bin link.
The Recycle Bin page appears. If you’re an administrator, use the View picklist 
to view and restore records deleted within the last 15 days by other users.
2.	 Navigate the list as you would a normal list page until you find the desired 
record or records.
3.	 Select the check box(es) in the Action column corresponding to the record(s) 
that you want to restore.
You can click the Select All link to select all the records on the page.
4.	 When you’re done, click the Undelete button.
The Recycle Bin page reappears, and a link to your restored record appears in 
the sidebar below Recent Items.
There is a maximum amount of space that the Recycle Bin can contain, before it 
starts automatically deleting the oldest files first, as long as they’re at least two 
hours old. The space is 25 times your organization’s total ­megabytes (MB) of stor-
age, which you can find by choosing Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Data Management ➪  
Storage Usage.
Detailing the Record
After you create and save a record, the record appears on its own detail page (see 
Figure 5-2 for an example using the Contact object). You can use the detail page 
to update the record fields or manage and track activities and common operations 
on the related lists displayed below the record. In this section, we show you how 
to navigate the detail page.
Some of the features that we describe in the following sections may not be enabled 
by default in your organization. If you can’t locate what we’re talking about, have 
your administrator choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ User Interface to turn on any 
of these capabilities.
Saving time with hover links
At the top of any record’s detail page is a row of several links. Each link corre-
sponds to a list of other records related to the current one. The label for each link 
consists of the name of that type of record, as well as the number that are related. 
So, when you’re looking at an Account detail page, instead of scrolling down the 

66      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
page to see whether any contacts exist, you can see how many exist right at the 
top. But wait, it gets better: You can click the link and immediately jump down to 
the bottom of the detail page to where that related list is normally found. And if 
you want to be even more efficient, instead of clicking the link, just hover your 
mouse over it. Salesforce will show you a preview of the related list that even 
includes buttons to create new records and clickable links to existing ones.
Using links and buttons on the detail page
At the top of any record’s detail page, you can use several links and buttons to 
perform different actions. Go to any detail page and try these out:
»
» Toggle between list and details. If you’ve arrived at a record from a list view, 
you’ll see in the upper left of the page a Back to List link. Click that to return 
quickly to your list view. Then click the Back button on your browser to return 
to the detail page.
»
» Edit a record. Click the Edit button to edit the record (if you have permission 
to do so). The record appears in Edit mode. Click the Cancel button to return 
to the detail page, or click Save to save the record.
»
» Delete the current record. Click the Delete button to delete the current 
record that you’re viewing (if you have permission to do so). Click the Cancel 
button in the pop-up window if you change your mind about the deletion.
FIGURE 5-2:  
Looking over the 
detail page of a 
new Contact 
record.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      67
»
» Share the record with other users. Click the Sharing button. (This button 
doesn’t appear on all records.) Click the Back button within your browser to 
return to the detail page.
»
» Quickly jump to the corresponding related list farther down the page. 
Click the related list “hover links” at the top of each detail page, if enabled by 
your administrator. Alternatively, hover your mouse over the link to open a 
snapshot of the records displayed in that related list.
»
» View a printable version of the page in a new window. Click the Printable 
View link in the upper right, and then click the Print This Page link in the 
upper-right corner of the window to print a copy of the entire page. Believe it 
or not, some users still like to print good old-fashioned hard copies that they 
can review while traveling (hey, we can’t always have access to the Internet or 
a cellular connection).
Modifying records with inline editing
To cut down on the number of steps you have to take when you update records in 
Salesforce, you can edit fields directly in detail pages.
Make sure that your administrator has enabled this feature.
Follow these steps to edit a field directly in that detail page, without having to go 
to another page. Salesforce calls this inline editing.
1.	 Hover your mouse over any field on a record that you own (or have 
permission to edit).
Figure 5-3 shows the email address of a contact within a company being 
updated.
An icon appears to the right of a field, telling you whether you can edit that 
field. Here’s what the various icons mean:
•	 Pencil: This icon appears to the right of editable fields, which become 
highlighted.
•	 Padlock: This icon appears to the right of fields that you can’t edit.
•	 None: You can edit a field that doesn’t have an icon, but not with the inline 
editing feature. You have to edit the record the old-fashioned way, using 
the Edit button.
FIGURE 5-3:  
Editing a field 
inline.

68      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
2.	 Double-click an editable field and update the information in that field.
3.	 Press Enter to complete editing that field.
4.	 After you finish editing all the fields you want for that record, click the Save 
button for the record.
If you happen to delete information in a field that requires something in it, 
don’t worry. Salesforce has a couple stop-gap measures to prevent you from 
messing things up. An Undo arrow icon appears before you save the record, 
and Salesforce is smart enough to remind you about required fields before let-
ting you save your changes.
Capitalizing on related lists
Related lists. Say it three times so you don’t forget the term. By designing the page 
with related lists, Salesforce enables you to gain 360-degree customer visibility 
and ensure that more detailed information is only a click away. For example, if 
you open an Account detail page for one of your major customers and scroll down 
below the record fields, you can see multiple contacts, activities, opportunities, 
cases, attachments, and so on listed as links from organized related lists. And if 
you don’t see these links, you have work to do.
Looking things up with lookup hovers
On any detail page, you can hover your mouse over a lookup field to get a pop-up 
preview of that other record’s contents. Figure 5-4 shows a preview of the account 
record by hovering over a contact’s company name.
A lookup field is any field that actually links to another record. A lookup field’s 
content is underlined to show that it acts as a link to another record. (Just don’t 
confuse lookup fields with the set of related lists that appears below the main 
body of a record’s detail page.)
FIGURE 5-4:  
Hovering over a 
lookup field 
provides a 
preview of that 
record.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      69
Reviewing Activities
Activities in Salesforce are scheduled calendar events and tasks. In many ways, the 
events and tasks in Salesforce are just like the activities you use in Microsoft Out-
look, Google Calendar, or any other productivity application. You can schedule 
events on your calendar, invite people to meetings, book a conference room, and 
add tasks to your to-do lists so that you don’t forget to get things done.
However, Salesforce takes activities further: You can easily link events and tasks 
to other related records, such as accounts, contacts, and so on. You can view activ-
ities both in the context of a relevant item (for example, all activities that relate to 
an account) and as a stand-alone from your calendar and task lists in the comfort 
and convenience of your home page. And, if you’re a manager, Salesforce allows 
you to stay up to speed on your direct reports and how they’re spending their time.
You can use activities in Salesforce to track all the significant tasks and events 
involved in acquiring, selling, and servicing customers. Think about all the actions 
that you and your teams perform to accomplish your job — meetings, calls, emails, 
even the occasional physical letter — and imagine the value of having all that 
information in one place at your fingertips. You can have such a place in Sales-
force, and you can easily link your activities together in an organized fashion.
Salesforce features several types of activities that you can access from the Open 
Activities and Activity History related lists displayed on many of the major records, 
including accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, and cases. In this chapter, we 
focus on events and tasks, but in the following list, we briefly explain all the vari-
ous activity records you can track in Salesforce:
»
» Task: Essentially a to-do. Use this activity record as your online yellow sticky 
note. It’s an activity that needs to be completed, but it doesn’t need a specific 
time or duration associated with it. For example, if you know that you’re 
supposed to follow up with a contact by sending a written letter, you can 
create a task such as Send Letter.
»
» Event: A calendared activity. An event has a scheduled time, date, and 
duration associated with it. It can also have invitees associated with it, as well 
as be a recurring thing that happens on a regular basis. Examples of common 
events are meetings, conference calls, and tradeshows.
»
» Log a Call: A task record of a completed call. Use Log a Call during or after a 
call to make sure that you capture important details. For example, use it when 
a contact calls you and you want to record comments or outcomes from the 
discussion.

70      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
»
» Send an Email: Logs an activity for an email that you send to a contact or a 
lead. You can send emails from Salesforce or a third-party email product, and 
capture that information directly inside Salesforce.
Creating Activities
Before you can begin managing your time or activities in Salesforce, you need to 
know the easiest and most reliable way to add events and tasks.
Creating an event
When you want to schedule activities that have a particular place, time, and dura-
tion, use event records. By using event records, you and your sales teams can keep 
better track of your calendars.
You can create an event from your home page, its calendar views, or the Open 
Activity related list of a record. The best method to choose often depends on what 
you’re doing. If you’re carving out meetings on a specific day, add events from 
your Home tab calendar’s Day View. If you’re working on a customer deal, you 
might create the event from an opportunity record. The end result is the same.
If you’re just getting accustomed to filling out records in Salesforce, create events 
from the record that’s most directly associated with the event. By using this 
method, many of the lookup fields are prefilled for you. So, when you save, you 
ensure that you can find the activity quickly because it’s linked to all the right 
records.
To create an event from a relevant record (such as a contact or account record), 
follow these steps:
1.	 Enter a name in the search field in the upper left, next to the Salesforce 
logo. Search for the record to which you want to link the event.
For example, if you want to schedule a meeting about an account, you search 
for the account name.
When you click Search, a Search Results page appears.
2.	 Click the name of the particular record you want.
The record’s detail page appears.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      71
3.	 Scroll down to the Open Activities related list on the page and click the New 
Event button, as shown in Figure 5-5.
A New Event page appears. If you created this event from a relevant record, 
the name of the person or the related record is prefilled for you.
4.	 Fill in the relevant fields.
Pay close attention to the required fields highlighted with a vertical red bar. 
Depending on your company’s customization, your event record may differ 
from the standard, but here are tips on some of the standard fields:
•	 Assigned To: Defaults to you. Use the Lookup icon (the little magnifying 
glass) to assign the event to another user.
•	 Subject: The event’s subject, which appears on the calendar. Click the 
combo box icon. A pop-up window appears, displaying a list of your 
company’s event types. When you click a selection, the window closes and 
your selection appears in the Subject field. To the immediate right of your 
selection’s text, customize the subject by adding a brief description. For 
example, you might click the Meeting link and then type Define 
Requirements to explain the event’s purpose.
•	 Related To: The standard event record shows two drop-down lists that you 
can use to link the event with relevant records, as shown in Figure 5-6. One 
relates to certain types of records — an account, opportunity, or case. The 
other relates to a person — a contact or lead. First, select the type of 
record and then use the associated Lookup icon to select the desired 
record. For example, if you select Opportunity from the first drop-down 
list, you can use the Opportunity icon to find a specific account.
If you use the Related To fields on activities, you’ll rarely have problems 
finding an activity later. For example, if you sell through channel partners, 
you might associate a meeting with a partner contact, but you might relate 
the meeting to an end-customer account. When you save the event, it 
appears on the related lists of both records.
•	 Time: Allows you to specify the start time and end time. You can use basic 
shorthand and avoid unnecessary keystrokes. For example, type 9a for 
9:00 a.m. or 2p for 2:00 p.m.
FIGURE 5-5:  
Creating an 
event.

72      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
•	 Recurrence: Allows you to create a series of events that repeat over a 
duration of time. This saves you from manually re-creating an event for 
each occurrence. You can set the frequency of the event, and optionally, 
when the last occurrence of the recurrence (got that?) happens.
5.	 Click Save.
The page you started from reappears, and the event appears under the Open 
Activities related list for the associated records. The event also appears on the 
home page of the user assigned to the event.
Alternatively, click the Save & New Event or Save & New Task button if you 
want to immediately create another activity. A new activity record appears in 
Edit mode.
Using pop-up reminders
Similar to many calendaring applications, Salesforce triggers pop-up reminders 
about events at a set time before the event is scheduled to start. If you live your 
life daily in Salesforce and have the application constantly logged in on your 
machine, this feature will gently remind you via a pop-up window, to make sure 
that you don’t forget an important meeting with a customer.
Make sure that your browser’s pop-up blocker protection is set to allow pop-ups 
that come from the Salesforce domain. Otherwise, if your browser has the pop-up 
blocker feature turned on, when you create an event, a little warning box appears 
every time your browser tries to display a reminder box.
If, on the other hand, you’re the type that lets pop-up reminders pile up on your 
computer screen, or if you log in to Salesforce infrequently (what sacrilege!), you 
FIGURE 5-6:  
Linking the event 
to related 
records.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      73
can disable this feature. From your name in the upper-right corner of the Sales-
force app, choose My Settings ➪ Calendar & Reminders ➪ Reminders & Alerts and 
deselect the Trigger Alert When Reminder Comes Due check box, along with any 
of the other boxes that are selected by default. Remember to click Save after you 
finish.
Creating a task
Some sales reps refer to tasks as action items; others call them reminders or to-
dos. Whatever your favorite term, use task records when you want to remind 
yourself or someone else of an activity that needs to get done.
You can create a task from the My Tasks section of your home page or from the 
Create New drop-down list on any page within Salesforce. We use both methods, 
depending on whether we’re planning out our weeks or strategizing about a par-
ticular account, contact, or other record.
To create a task from the relevant record, follow these steps:
1.	 Enter a name in the search bar for the record to which you want to link 
the task and click the Search button.
For example, if you want to set a task to review a proposal that relates to an 
opportunity, search for the opportunity name. After you click Search, a Search 
Results page appears.
2.	 Click the name of the record you want.
The record’s detail page appears.
3.	 Select Create New Task from the sidebar or click the New Task button on the 
Open Activities related list of a record, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Either way, the result is the same. A New Task page appears.
When creating tasks, go to the record that the task is most directly related to 
before adding the task. By taking this path, you ensure that your task is easy to 
find because it’s automatically associated with the correct record and its 
account. For example, if you’re creating a task to follow up on an email to a 
contact, you most likely add the task from the contact record.
FIGURE 5-7:  
Creating a 
new task.

74      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
4.	 Fill in the relevant fields.
Like the event record, your fields may vary, but here are some tips on adding a 
task:
•	 Assigned To: Defaults to you. Use the Lookup icon to assign the task to 
another user.
•	 Subject: The task’s subject, which appears on the My Tasks section of the 
Assigned To’s home page. Click the combo box icon. A pop-up window 
appears, displaying a list of your company’s activity types. When you click a 
selection, the window closes and your selection appears in the Subject 
field. To the immediate right of your selection, add a brief description. For 
example, you might click the Send Letter link and then type Introduction 
to explain the task’s purpose.
•	 Related To: Shows two drop-down lists that you can use to link the task with 
relevant records similar to the event fields. First, select the type of record, 
and then use the associated Lookup icon to select the desired record.
•	 Priority: Denotes the task’s importance. High-priority tasks display an 
exclamation point (!) to the left of the activity on the assigned user’s home 
page.
•	 Status: Defines the status of the task.
•	 Due Date: The date by which you expect the task to be completed. This is 
typically optional. Clicking your cursor in this field makes a calendar 
window pop up; you can select a date from this calendar.
5.	 Click Save.
The page that you started from reappears, and the task displays under the 
Open Activities related list for the associated records. The task also appears in 
the My Tasks section of the home page of the user who’s assigned to the task.
Make sure that you set your My Tasks view on the home page so that your 
tasks are included in the filter. The view defaults to Overdue, which can con-
fuse some people when they don’t see a recently created task in that area.
Always link your tasks with the relevant records in Salesforce. Otherwise, you run 
the risk of losing valuable customer information that might have been captured in 
that task.
Logging a call
Sometimes, you perform a task and just want to log the activity after the fact. For 
example, a contact calls you on the phone, or you get stopped in the coffee room 

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      75
by your boss to talk about a customer issue. In these situations, instead of creating 
a task, saving it, and then completing it, use the Log a Call feature.
When you click the Log a Call button, you’re simply creating a task record that has 
a Completed Activity Status. To log a call, go to the record that the call relates to 
(an account or lead record, for example) and follow these steps:
1.	 Scroll down to the Activity History related list and click the Log a 
Call button.
The Log a Call page appears, displaying fields for a completed task at the top of 
the page and fields for a follow-up activity at the bottom of the page.
2.	 Fill out or modify any of the fields to log the call.
The Status field is preset to Completed, as shown in Figure 5-8.
3.	 If applicable, add another related task by filling out the fields below the 
Schedule Follow Up Task header.
Although certain fields are labeled as required, the follow-up task is optional.
4.	 Click Save when you’re finished.
The detail page that you started from reappears. The call record appears under 
the Activity History related list. If you set up a new follow-up task, that record 
appears under the Open Activities related list.
Instead of using the Notes feature in Salesforce to track details of your interac-
tions with customers and prospects, we recommend using Log a Call to record this 
FIGURE 5-8:  
Logging a call.

76      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
type of information. Tasks allow for easier reporting, timestamping, editing, and 
viewing capabilities. You can even track interactions with multiple people at once 
using the Shared Activities feature. If you don’t see this feature when creating a 
Task, ask your Salesforce Administrator to turn it on.
If you’re an administrator and someone asks you to allow Shared Activity track-
ing, you could enable that by choosing Settings ➪ Customize ➪ Activities ➪ Activity 
Settings ➪ Allow Users to Relate Multiple Contacts to Tasks and Events. However, 
this is an irreversible request, and you should reflect on the majority use case for 
this. For example, in some financial services businesses, tasks often involve con-
tacts in addition to your prospect. However, no one’s going to use this (maybe not 
even the person who asked for it) unless it’s properly announced, along with ben-
efits derived from its use.
Organizing and Viewing Activities
You can view your activities from the home page and from a specific record’s Open 
Activities or Activity History related list. If you’re planning your calendar, use the 
home page. If you’re working from a particular account, contact, or other item, 
you can get better context on pertinent activities from the related lists on the 
record.
After you create (or are assigned to) activities, you probably want to view them so 
that you can prioritize and complete them.
On the home page, change the default view in the My Tasks section to All Open or 
to Today, depending on how efficient you are, so that you can see all tasks that you 
still need to complete. The current default view, Overdue, only shows you tasks 
after the due date has passed, which we have found to not be many users’ first 
choice.
If you’re planning around a specific record, such as a contact or opportunity, you 
can view linked activities from the Open Activities and Activity History related 
lists located on a detail page.
The two related lists work hand in hand. An event record automatically moves 
from the Open Activities related list to the Activity History related list when the 
scheduled date and time pass. A task record remains on the Open Activities related 
list until its Status is changed to Completed; then the record appears on the Activ-
ity History related list.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      77
To view activities from a detail page, follow these steps:
1.	 Open a saved record.
The detail page of the record appears. The saved record appears at the top, 
and related lists are at the bottom of the page.
2.	 Scroll down until you see the Open Activities and Activity History related 
lists.
If you already created related activities, activity links appear in the lists.
3.	 Click an item listed under the Subject column.
The activity record appears.
Updating Activities
Things happen: Meetings get canceled, and small tasks suddenly become big pri-
orities. With Salesforce, you can perform many of the actions that a normal time-
management tool would allow you to do, including delegating activities to other 
users, rescheduling, editing information, deleting records, and so on.
You can do the following basic functions by clicking buttons at the top of an activ-
ity record:
»
» Edit: Update any of the fields in the record whose fields now appear, and 
make sure that you save.
»
» Delete: Delete the record. A pop-up window appears in which you can 
confirm the deletion.
»
» Create a Follow Up Task: Generate a related task. A New Task page opens, 
prefilled with information from the prior record.
»
» Create a Follow Up Event: Schedule a related meeting. A New Event page 
appears, prefilled with information from the prior record.
Assigning activities
Sometimes, you may create activities and assign them to others (intentionally, not 
because you’re trying to shirk your duties). Sales development reps often do this 
as they set up meetings for their account executives. Salesforce lets you easily 
reassign tasks and events.

78      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
To assign an activity, open the activity record and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Edit button.
2.	 Click the Lookup icon to the right of the Assigned To field.
A pop-up window appears, displaying a list of your Salesforce users.
3.	 Use the Search field to search for the user or select the user from the list.
After you make a selection, the pop-up window disappears, and your selection 
appears in the Assigned To field.
4.	 Click Save.
The activity record reappears, and the Assigned To field has been modified.
Completing a task
When you’re done with a task, you want to gladly get it off the list of things to do. 
You can mark a task as complete from your home page or from the Open Activities 
related list in which the task link is displayed.
To complete a task, follow these steps:
1.	 If you’re viewing the task from an Open Activities related list, click the Cls 
link (Salesforce shorthand for “Close”) to the left of the task. If you’re 
looking at the task on the home page, click the X link in the 
Completed column.
Both links have the same result when clicked: The task appears in Edit mode, 
and the Status field changes to Completed. (Your company might have its own 
terminology for the Completed status.)
2.	 Type any changes and click Save.
Some reps update the Comments field if they have relevant new information. 
The detail page reappears, and the completed task now appears under the 
Activity History related list.
Understanding Email Fields in Salesforce
Email is a fundamental method for communicating with customers, prospects, 
and friends. By using email correctly, you can better manage your sales territory 
and be more responsive to customers. However, by not using email appropriately, 
you can leave a bad impression or lose a client.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      79
If email is an indispensable part of your business, you and other users can send 
email from Salesforce and track the communication history from relevant records, 
such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and cases. This capability is helpful if 
you inherit a major customer account, because you can potentially view all the 
email interactions from a single account record.
In this section, we show you best practices for sending a basic email, mass email-
ing, and using templates.
An email in Salesforce is an activity record comprising fields for the message and 
for the people you want to keep in the loop on the message.
The email record comes with standard fields that people commonly use when 
sending email. Most fields are self-explanatory, but the following list summarizes 
some additional fields:
»
» Related To: Use this field to relate the email to an account, opportunity, 
campaign, case, or other standard or custom object record in Salesforce, 
depending on your edition. By completing this field, the email is stored under 
the Activity History related list of that record. See the “Creating and sending 
email” section, later in this chapter.
»
» Additional To: Use this field to type in additional primary recipients. They 
don’t have to be contacts or leads in Salesforce.
»
» Attachment: Of course, you know what an email attachment is, but we want 
to let you know that the size limit is 10MB per email message within 
Salesforce.
Setting Up Your Email
Before you begin emailing people from Salesforce, check out a couple of setup 
options that can save you time and headaches. In the following sections, we show 
you how to personalize your outbound email, as well as how to build personal 
email templates for common messages that you send to people.
Personalizing your email settings
When you send an email via Salesforce, the recipient can receive the message just 
as if you sent the email from your standard email program. The email message 
appears as if it came from your business email address, and you can use a 

80      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
standard signature to go with your message. And if the recipient replies to your 
email, that reply email comes right to your standard email inbox. To pull this off, 
though, you need to personalize your email settings in Salesforce.
To set up your email, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Your Name ➪ My Settings ➪ Email ➪ My Email Settings.
The My Email Settings page appears in Edit mode.
2.	 Modify the first two required fields, as necessary, to specify the outgoing 
name and the return email address.
3.	 Select the Yes radio button if you want to send a blind carbon copy (BCC) to 
your standard email inbox.
That way, you can still keep emails in customer folders in your email 
­application.
4.	 Modify the Email Signature field.
If you’re personalizing your email settings for the first time, you might notice a 
default signature from Salesforce. This message appears at the bottom of your 
email in lieu of your signature. Unless you’re using Personal Edition, go ahead 
and change it.
5.	 Click Save.
The Email page under Personal Setup appears, and your settings are modified.
Building personal email templates
If you ask your top sales reps about sending email, they’ll probably tell you that 
they don’t re-invent the wheel every time they send certain messages to custom-
ers. It’s a waste of their time, and time is money. Instead, they use templates and 
form letters to send the same message with less work.
In your standard sales process, you probably send a variety of emails to custom-
ers, including
»
» Letters of introduction
»
» Thank-you notes
»
» Responses to common objections
»
» Answers on competition

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      81
Although you do need to personalize a message to fit the specific details of a cus-
tomer, you probably use certain effective phrases and sentences over and over 
again. Instead of searching for a prior message and cutting and pasting, you can 
create personal email templates and improve your productivity.
To create a personal template, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Your Name ➪ My Settings ➪ Email ➪ Email Templates.
An Email Templates page appears.
2.	 Select the My Personal Email Templates folder in the drop-down list, if it’s not 
already set to that.
3.	 Click the New Template button.
Step 1 of the New Template Wizard appears.
4.	 Select the radio button for Text, HTML, Custom, or Visualforce to set the 
type of email that you want to create, and click Next.
•	 Text: Uses a basic text-only template without any formatting
•	 HTML: Uses a previously created letterhead and supports HTML formatting
•	 Visualforce: Lets you create an email template within a Visualforce page
•	 Custom: Lets you paste previously created HTML code as your template
The next page of the wizard appears, and the content of the page depends on 
the choice you made. Using HTML is most common and has certain advan-
tages, both from appearance and tracking standpoints, but older email 
programs cannot receive HTML email.
5.	 If you select Text in the previous step, complete the template fields provided 
(see Figure 5-9) and then click Save.
You can use the template only after you select the Available for Use check box.
After clicking Save, a Text Email Template page for your new template appears 
in Saved mode with an Attachments related list.
6.	 (Optional) Attach a document.
7.	 If you select either HTML option (HTML or Custom) in Step 4, enter the 
properties for the email template and click the Save & Next button.
If you choose to build your email template with a letterhead, you have to select 
a previously created letterhead and then a layout by using the drop-down lists 
provided. After you click the Next button, the Step 3 page of the wizard 
appears.

82      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
You can create HTML or Custom email templates only if you have the Edit 
HTML Templates permission. See an admin if you don’t have the right 
­permissions.
8.	Create the HTML version by typing and formatting the content and copying 
and pasting merge fields.
9.	Click Preview to review your work and, when you’re done, click the Save & 
Next button.
The Step 4 page of the wizard appears.
10.	Enter the text version of the email template.
Customers who can’t or don’t want to receive HTML emails can receive the text 
version. If the message is similar or identical to the HTML version, click the 
Copy Text from HTML Version button and modify the content as needed.
11.	Click the Save button.
An HTML or Custom Email Template page for your new template appears in 
Saved mode with an Attachments related list, which you can use for attaching 
standard documents.
We show you how to use your email template in the later section “Using email 
templates.”
FIGURE 5-9:  
Create a text 
template.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      83
Creating letterheads
If you’re a system administrator, you can create and save custom-branded let-
terheads to ensure that all your templates have a similar look and feel.
To create a letterhead, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Communication Templates ➪ Letterheads.
If this is your first time visiting, an Understanding Letterheads page appears. 
You can bypass it by clicking the Next button.
2.	 Click the New Letterhead button.
The Letterhead Properties section of the New Letterhead Wizard appears.
3.	 Select the Available For Use check box. Then fill in the required fields marked 
in red and optionally enter a description.
If you don’t want to let anyone use the letterhead just yet, you can leave the 
Available For Use check box deselected for now.
4.	 Click the Save button.
The Letterhead Details section of the New Letterhead Wizard appears (see 
Figure 5-10). This is where you can graphically design your letterhead.
FIGURE 5-10:

84      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
5.	Click the Edit Background Color button.
The Background Color window opens with the default color as gray. You can 
set it to any HTML color code or use the Paint Can button to select from a color 
chart. When you’re done, click the OK button to close the window.
6.	Click the Select Logo button.
The Attach File window opens to let you select from any image that has already 
been uploaded to the Documents tab in Salesforce. When you find the file you 
want, click its name to select it and close the window.
Make sure the document is marked as an externally available image.
7.	Click the Edit Header Properties button.
The Header Properties window opens. You can specify the background color, 
the horizontal and vertical alignment, and the height of the Header section to 
ensure that your logo looks great. When you’re done, click the OK button to 
close the window.
8.	Click the Edit Top Line button.
The Top Color and Height window opens. If you don’t want a top line, you can 
set the line color to the same as your background and set the height to 0. 
When you’re done, click OK to close the window.
9.	Click the remaining buttons to make additional edits to your letterhead.
You can configure the middle and bottom lines, the footer properties and logo, 
and the body background color, just as you did in the previous steps.
10.	Click the Save button.
A preview of your new letterhead is shown. You can always make additional 
changes by clicking the Edit Letterhead button.
Sending Email from Salesforce
You can send an email to any lead or contact stored in Salesforce with a valid email 
address. By sending from Salesforce, you can ensure that you and your team 
members can keep track of critical outbound communications to customers and 
prospects.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      85
Creating and sending email
You can initiate your outbound email from many different records in Salesforce, 
including opportunity, account, case, campaign, lead, and contact records. To cre-
ate and send an email, go to the relevant record and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Send an Email button on the Activity History related list.
A Send an Email page appears, as shown in Figure 5-11. The Email format is in 
Text, with a Switch to Format link appearing to the right of it. Alternatively, click 
the Send an Email button in the HTML Email Status related list to default to 
HTML format. Either way, if you change your mind, you can always switch 
formats on the Send an Email edit page.
If you have organization-wide email addresses set up in Salesforce, you can 
select one as your From address. If not, your email address will default as the 
From address.
2.	 Decide in what format you want to send your email:
•	 Switch to Text Only: You want to send the message using only text — no 
HTML. A dialog box appears to warn you that any HTML formatting will be 
removed. When you click OK, the box disappears, and the format is 
switched.
FIGURE 5-11:  
Composing an 
email.

86      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
•	 Switch to HTML: Send your message in HTML format. If you decide to send 
your email with HTML, you get an added bonus of being able to track your 
email (see the later section “Tracking HTML emails”).
3.	 Type the recipient’s name in the To field and then click the Lookup icon at 
the right of the field to search for the contact or lead.
A pop-up window appears, containing a search tool and a list of search results.
If you send an email from the relevant lead or contact record, you can elimi-
nate this step because the To field is prefilled. But remember to use the 
Related To field to associate the email to other records, such as an opportunity.
4.	 Select the correct person by clicking the name, or refine your search by modi-
fying the name or using wildcards; then click Go.
When you select the recipient, the pop-up window disappears, and the To field 
is populated with your selection.
5.	 Use the Related To drop-down list to associate the email with the correct 
type of record, and then click the Lookup icon to the right of the adjacent 
field to find the exact record — similar to the process in Steps 3 and 4.
Depending on which record you started from, the Related To drop-down list 
might already be filled.
6.	 In the Additional To field, type additional primary recipient emails.
These folks get their email on the To list. They don’t have to be contacts or 
leads.
7.	 Clicking the CC link or the BCC link lets you copy other contacts or users to 
the email.
A pop-up window appears, containing a drop-down list for co-workers at your 
company and for contacts of the account. Select names in the Contacts list box, 
use the double arrows to include them as recipients, and then click Save. The 
pop-up window disappears, and the CC and BCC fields reflect your selections.
8.	 Click in the CC or BCC fields and add additional email addresses, as needed.
Salesforce allows you to send emails to people who aren’t contacts, leads, or 
users. Just type the email address directly in this field.
If you want to use an email template, stop here and go to the next section.
9.	 Complete the Subject and Body fields of the message and then click Send.
If your contact or lead in the To field doesn’t yet have an email address, this 
absence is flagged before you send the email. A Click Here to Edit the Email 
Address link appears that you can click to associate an email address with the 
record without having to leave your Send an Email page.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      87
The record that you started from reappears, and a link to a copy of your email 
appears in the Activity History related lists of the records that you linked.
Using email templates
In the section “Building personal email templates,” earlier in this chapter, we 
show you how to create a personalized template. In this section, you find out how 
to send an email that uses a template you created. First, create an email (as 
described in the preceding section), and then follow these additional steps before 
you send it:
1.	 Before you modify the Subject and Body fields, click the Select Template 
button at the top of the page.
A pop-up window appears, displaying a list of available templates.
2.	 Click the Folder drop-down list and select the folder where you saved your 
template.
The pop-up window refreshes, displaying a list of available templates based on 
your folder selection, as shown in Figure 5-12.
3.	 Select the desired template by clicking the relevant link in the Name column.
The pop-up window disappears, and the page reappears with content based 
on the template that you selected.
4.	 Modify the message to further personalize the email and then click Send.
The record you started from reappears, and a link to a copy of your email 
appears under the Activity History related lists of the linked records.
Due to Saleforce’s presence in so many sales organizations, a whole ecosystem of 
third-party vendor applications have sprouted that sync externally sent emails 
with Salesforce. Go to www.appexchange.com and search in the Email and Calen-
dar Sync category to learn about the options available with your email system.
FIGURE 5-12:  
Available email 
templates.

88      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Sending Mass Email
If you struggle to stay in touch with prospects or customers on a regular basis, you 
can use Salesforce to send mass emails and lighten your workload. Mass email is 
particularly helpful for sales reps who send common messages that don’t require 
a lot of personalization. For example, if you’re an institutional sales rep selling 
shares of a hedge fund, you might want to send a monthly email newsletter to 
sophisticated investors specifically interested in your fund.
When sending mass email, Professional Edition users can send a maximum of 250 
emails at a time. Enterprise Edition users can send as many as 500 emails, and 
Unlimited Edition users can send as many as 1,000 emails. A company is limited 
to 1,000 emails per day.
You can send a mass email to contacts or leads — the method is similar.
To send out a mass email, go to the Contacts home page or Leads home page, and 
follow these simple steps:
1.	 Click the Mass Email Contacts link or the Mass Email Leads link (depend-
ing on which home page you’re on) under the Tools section.
The Recipient Selection page appears.
2.	 Specify the recipients that you want to include in the email from the View 
drop-down list and click the Go button.
If you find the recipients you want, skip to Step 5.
3.	 If you can’t find the view that you want from the View drop-down list, click 
the Create New View link.
The Create New View page appears. In most circumstances, you need to create 
a custom view.
4.	 To create the new view, fill in the information that you want to use to filter 
the recipients for your mass email and then click Save.
For example, if you want to send an email to all customer contacts located in 
New York, you can build a view. (See Chapter 17 for general details on how to 
create custom views.) When you click Save, the Recipient Selection page reap-
pears, displaying a list of contacts that meet your criteria.
Any of your leads or contacts that have the Email Opt Out check box selected 
are automatically omitted from these lists.

CHAPTER 5  Working in Salesforce      89
5.	Review the list and select the check boxes to designate the contacts to whom 
you want to send the mass email.
Contacts or leads that don’t have email addresses lack an available check box 
in the Action column.
6.	When you’re satisfied with your selections, click Next.
A Template Selection page appears, where you can select an email template 
from the email template folders and associated lists.
7.	Use the Folder drop-down list to locate the right folder and template.
You can skip this step if you already see the desired email template on the list 
results.
8.	Select the desired email template by selecting the appropriate radio button 
in the Name column, and then click Next.
9.	Review the content for the mass email and then click Next.
A Confirmation page appears, summarizing the number of contacts that will 
receive the mass email.
10.	Select the appropriate check boxes if you want to receive a blind copy, store 
an activity, and/or use your signature.
11.	Give this mass email a name in the Mass Email Name field.
12.	Use the radio buttons to select whether you want to send the email now or 
schedule it for delivery (set the time and date in the Schedule for Delivery On 
and Time Zone fields).
13.	When you’re done, click Send.
A Complete page appears, confirming the delivery of your mass email.
Getting Help and Setting Up
In the upper-right corner of any Salesforce page, to the left of the Force.com app 
menu, you find a set of links that can help you get more out of Salesforce:
»
» Your Name: This picklist menu is labeled with your full name. Click the down 
arrow next to your name to select links to edit your personal profile informa-
tion or your personal settings.
»
» Setup: Click this link to open a page containing the Force.com home page for 
all things under the hood. If you’re an administrator, you’ll be able to adminis-
ter and customize Salesforce for your company from Setup.

E
very one of us has been the new guy or gal at a company at some point in our 
lives. Even if you received a formal orientation and a review of the organiza-
tional chart (a luxury that you shouldn’t take for granted), do you remember 
still having to meander around, finding that person who has the answers? Or 
maybe you’re an old-timer who is extremely busy but always willing to answer a 
newcomer’s questions because you remember how overwhelming it was when you 
first started.
Organizations have huge amounts of varying types of knowledge: formal and 
informal, documented and verbal, current and outdated. Very rarely is knowledge 
shared in one centralized location. Even when a company is pretty diligent about 
communicating, the sheer volume of information and the speed at which current 
information gets outdated can be overwhelming. Chatter bridges the gap between 
sharing useful information and information overload by allowing you to commu-
nicate quickly with colleagues, as well as keep track of progress and updates on 
topics as they happen.
Chapter 6

92      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
In this chapter, we discuss how Chatter, when used correctly, works to eliminate 
all that information chaos by providing a central place where Salesforce users can 
update statuses, post and respond to questions, and see recent activity on records 
to easily collaborate in a private and secure environment. We walk you through 
setting up your profile, updating your status, and using groups and feeds so that 
your sales, marketing, and customer service organizations can work together even 
more effectively.
At the time of this writing, Chatter has three license types. A Salesforce license 
already comes with full Chatter features, but there are also three different Chatter-
specific licenses for colleagues who don’t need to be in Salesforce, but could still 
benefit from collaborating with people who work in Salesforce often. The free license 
just lets users see status updates from others, but they can’t click into any customer 
relationship management (CRM) tabs, like Accounts or Contacts. The external license 
is like the free license, but it’s intended for customers and other external users. You 
can add them to specific Chatter groups for collaborative projects, but they can’t see 
your Salesforce data. Chatter Only (or Chatter Plus) is an additional charge for users 
who may only need to see Accounts and Contacts, and some custom apps, but not 
Opportunities. All these options are for colleagues who don’t need to be in Sales-
force but could still benefit from collaborating with people who work in Salesforce 
often. If you’re a daily user of Salesforce, your license comes with Chatter.
Each profile, group, and status update you make is a record in Salesforce, which 
adds to your data and storage usage numbers. Salesforce has also set some limits 
on the number of posts and comments that are stored in Salesforce (and for how 
long). It’s usually not an issue, but if your organization has a bunch of die-hard 
super-users (and what organization doesn’t?), always check with your account 
executive for more details.
Preparing to Use Chatter
When you get a new car, it’s tempting to just drive away as soon as you’re handed 
the keys, but taking a few minutes to read the owner’s manual may serve you 
­better. The same holds true for Salesforce Chatter. By spending a little extra time 
preparing, you can ensure a successful implementation of this powerful feature 
and ensure your standing as a Salesforce hero in your company.
Here are some key actions that we recommend for every Chatter implementation:
»
» Get key executives of your organization to use Chatter. Engage 
­executives early, help them update their profiles (more on that later), and 
show them how easy it is to follow other employees. They’ll love the 

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      93
­communication-improvement aspect of Salesforce Chatter and will encourage 
their employees to post regular updates.
»
» Allow the most informational objects to be followed. If you have a popular 
product or brand, you may get hundreds of leads a day in Salesforce. Being 
able to track Chatter on leads is important, especially if you can selectively 
choose which records to monitor. Other types of records (such as Products) 
probably won’t change that often and, thus, don’t warrant tracking via Chatter. 
As part of your preparation, you have to determine which objects make sense 
to track for your business.
»
» Prepare for the change. Your organization may not have processes in place 
to provide routine updates to management. People naturally resist change, 
especially change that embraces sharing what they’re doing. When you put 
together your communications plan introducing Salesforce Chatter, be sure to 
focus on the timesaving aspect and reassure people that it’s not a surveillance 
tool used by Big Brother. It’s meant to encourage collaboration.
»
» Lead by example. Show users how to find and follow your profile. Then be 
sure to post status updates about the work you’re doing so that they can get a 
feel for how it works. You can even create polls via Chatter to encourage 
participation.
»
» Establish basic posting guidelines. Your colleagues may already be used to 
an informal posting functionality of social-networking sites, but before they 
post personal information in Chatter, set some basic guidelines. Here are 
some ideas to get you started:
•	 Keep Chatter updates related to business matters.
•	 Don’t post anything you wouldn’t want to be seen by your CEO, HR 
department, or peers.
•	 Never post confidential information that isn’t widely available elsewhere in 
your organization.
•	 Keep statements constructive and professional. Leave the flame wars and 
boorishness to anonymous forums.
»
» Provide training sessions and FAQs. Education is the key to success for any 
Salesforce implementation. Training and documentation not only improve 
adoption but also ensure that users make fewer mistakes. The same holds 
true for implementing Chatter. It might seem easy to “just turn it on,” but if 
people aren’t all on the same page on when and how to use the tool, 
­information that’s posted won’t be helpful, which will affect adoption rates.
An FAQ list is a basic question-and-answer document that your users can ref-
erence. In addition to the previous guidelines, you can include sample status 

94      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
updates (good and bad ones) and instructions on common tasks. See 
Chapter 8 to find out how you can create a reusable email template that 
includes your FAQs and guidelines.
»
» Continue adoption. When new employees join your company, be sure to 
bring them onboard them with training, and review your FAQs and Chatter 
guidelines with them. This will ensure that they continue the success of your 
Chatter implementation and prevent any embarrassing mistakes.
Understanding Key Chatter Terms
Here are some Chatter-related terms to familiarize yourself with:
»
» Profile: A page about a specific person in your company who is using 
Salesforce. A profile can include the person’s name, a short bio, contact 
information, and a photo, for example. The one for yourself is accessed from 
the top menu, via your name. That page is called My Settings, and we discuss 
how to update that in Chapter 3.
»
» Feed: A Chatter feed shows a chronological list of activities performed by 
people or records within your company’s Salesforce instance.
»
» People: A collection of people within your company who have Chatter 
profiles.
»
» @: Pronounced at, type this symbol and then immediately the name of a 
co-worker whom you want to include in your post, in the hopes of giving him 
a specific heads-up or asking him to join in the conversation. If you have 
emails allowed and the user you are mentioning has opted to receive email 
notifications from Chatter activity, the user will get an email notifying him of 
that specific post.
»
» Following/Unfollowing: The act of following (or unfollowing) a person or 
record to see (or no longer see) her feed updates. These can include com-
ments, posts, and updates to certain fields within a record. Other people in 
your Salesforce organization can also choose to follow you.
»
» Post: A type of update that you make about yourself that’s added to your feed 
for others to see. Because it’s called a post, you’re usually posting an update to 
some work most likely associated with a record.
»
» Comment: A response that you write based on another person’s feed activity. 
For example, if an opportunity that people are following is finally won, your 
CEO could comment on the feed and say, “Congratulations, team!”

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      95
»
» Like: A very quick way to cast your vote saying that you also approve of a 
particular post or comment.
»
» Share: A quick way to share a post with your followers or a specific group.
»
» File: A document (up to 2GB in size) that can be attached to a post or com-
ment. It can come from your computer or from within files you own in 
Salesforce.
»
» Group: A way to collaborate with specific people. People can join these freely, 
or you can make them private so that people have to request entry or be 
invited, and its contents are not seen by nonmembers.
Turning On Chatter
Chatter is automatically enabled for all new customers. However, if you subscribed 
a long time ago or turned it off, then before your company can begin using Chatter, 
your system administrator has to make some minor changes to your Salesforce 
configuration.
The first step in using Chatter is activating it in Salesforce Setup. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Chatter ➪ Chatter Settings.
The Chatter Settings page appears.
2.	 Select the Enable check box.
Several more sections appear.
3.	 Review the fields that have defaulted to having the check box selected.
•	 Allow Group Archiving: This allows groups without any activity over a 90-day 
period to be archived so that group clutter is minimized. Sometimes 
people create groups for one-time events; this option allows the organiza-
tion to archive a group, which keeps this group information in the system 
without letting new users join or add to the conversation. You can search 
for them if needed.
•	 Allow Records in Groups: This allows the addition of account, contact, lead, 
opportunity, contract, campaign, case, and custom object records to 
groups. You still need to include the Add Record action in the group 
publisher layout if you want users to be able to add records to the groups.

96      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
•	 Allow Rich Link Previews: When people post a URL, a preview of a photo or 
video from that URL is shown.
•	 Allow Customer Invitations: This allows Chatter users to invite people outside 
of your company’s email domain into your organization via a private group. 
They won’t have access to anything outside of that group.
•	 Enable Actions in the Publisher: Allows you to add actions to the publisher 
layout, as well as the order in which they appear. You can add these 
actions on the home page, Chatter tab, and records themselves.
•	 Allow Today Recommendations: This enables Chatter feed recommendations 
within the Salesforce1 mobile app. The Chatter feed includes recommen-
dations for users, such as suggesting groups to join.
•	 Allow Users to Edit Posts and Comments: This allows certain users to modify 
posts and comments. The users are authors of the post or comment, 
record owners, or Chatter moderators.
•	 Allow Users to Compose Rich Text Posts: Allows users to use rich text in their 
posts so that they can use formatting or bullets.
If some of your users want external people to be invited into a private Chatter 
group, pause for a moment and think about that external user’s user experience. 
Is this a great way to collaborate on a project? Will they mind having to log in to a 
different system on a regular basis to share information? What if they have their 
own instance of Salesforce — will they get mixed up logging into two organiza-
tions’ Chatter conversations every day? Every situation is different, and you can’t 
control 100 percent of it. But make sure that your employees know that adoption 
by the external person is highly dependent on the context and expectations set.
Locating Chatter on Your Home Page
After your administrator turns on Chatter, you’ll notice it at the top of your home 
page when you log in to Salesforce.
As shown in Figure 6-1, after you set up your profile, Chatter shows a photo of 
you, today’s date, and a feed of status updates from yourself and others whom 
you’re following. All this occurs in the middle section of your home page.
The rest of your home page is still there. Your tasks, dashboard, and calendar have 
just moved down the screen. You can always click the Hide Feed link right below 
your top photo to, well, hide the Chatter feed.

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      97
Profiling Yourself
The first thing you should do when starting Chatter is to update your profile. 
When you click your name anywhere in the Chatter feed or click My Profile below 
your name in the upper-right menu area, you’re taken to your My Profile page. 
Your profile page is your work profile, displaying your profile picture, more infor-
mation about yourself (your background, contact information, past roles, hobbies, 
and so on), a history of your status updates, the co-workers who follow you, and 
the co-workers and Salesforce records that you follow.
Your profile is also what others see when they click your name, which means that 
profiles work like a company directory. Be sure that you don’t include any infor-
mation in your profile that you don’t want everyone in your company to see.
To update your My Profile page, refer to Chapter 4.
Keeping Everyone Informed with Posts
Part of what makes Chatter work is letting your co-workers — even maybe your 
boss — know what you’re up to. In return, you can find out what they’re doing. In 
this section, we show you how to post as well as how to comment on others’ posts.
Posting a status
Posts are what your followers see. You can update posts to let others know what 
you’re working on, to ask questions, or to share files or website links. The 
FIGURE 6-1:  
Viewing your 
Chatter feed.

98      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
inspiration comes from status updates on websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, 
that play an increasing role in people’s personal lives. If you have a Facebook or 
Twitter account, you’ll pick up Chatter in no time.
To make a post, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Chatter tab or the Home tab.
Either option takes you to a page with a Chatter feed in it.
If you’re at the home page, your Chatter feed must be showing. If it’s not, click 
the Show Feed link below your photo at the top of the page.
2.	 Make a post in the open field near the top of the page where it says, “Share 
an update, @mention someone.”
3.	 (Optional) Attach a file or a website link, or append a poll to your update by 
clicking the File, Link, or Poll icon, respectively, directly above the Status box. 
These may appear under the More drop-down list on the right.
You may want to link to an interesting article that you read online or upload a 
file with a presentation you’re working on.
4.	 Click the Share button to publish your update.
Your post is published.
5.	 (Optional) From the small drop-down list to the right of your post, select the 
Delete option to remove it.
If you ever make a typo or post something embarrassing, you can always 
delete that entry and make it disappear from the feed.
Commenting on posts
When you’re following people, you start seeing their posts in your Chatter feed on 
the home page. Chatter allows you to add comments to posts, thus creating and 
managing multiple conversations in an organized fashion.
To add a comment to someone’s post, follow these steps:
1.	 Locate the post in the Chatter feed.
2.	 Click the Comment link below the post.
3.	 Type your comment in the indented field that appears below the post.

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      99
4.	 Click the Comment button when you’re done writing.
Your comment appears indented below the original update, as shown in 
Figure 6-2.
Choosing What to Follow
Before you can follow anything, your administrator needs to enable Chatter on 
certain objects. Objects are types of records. They’re the words (for example, 
Accounts) that appear at the top of your Salesforce page; you can click these words, 
and then they look like highlighted tabs. (For a review of how to navigate the 
default objects in Salesforce, turn to Chapter 3.)
Your administrator and executive stakeholders should decide which objects to 
first turn on for following: typically, the one or two objects that your Salesforce 
users collaborate on the most, such as Opportunities.
Configuring your Chatter feeds
After you determine which objects need to be followed, you can enable Chatter for 
those objects:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Chatter ➪ Feed Tracking.
The Feed Tracking page appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.
2.	 Click the name of an object in the Object list on the left side.
The Fields In page for that object appears.
FIGURE 6-2:  
Commenting on a 
post.

100      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
3.	 Select the Enable Feed Tracking check box.
4.	 Select each check box for the fields that you want to track with Chatter.
Select fields that others will want to be notified about when a change occurs to 
that field, for example, Areas of Interest, Next Step, Status, or Stage.
You get a maximum of 20 fields on any given object that you can track with 
Chatter. You may be able to expand this number for an additional cost.
5.	 Repeat for other objects. When you’re done, click Save.
Following people
When you first start Chatter, the feed will be empty because you’re not following 
anyone. In this section, we show you how to follow people in your organization.
Follow the people in your organization who are working on things that interest 
you or that affect what you’re doing so that you can join the conversation. All the 
people you can follow are listed on the All People subsection of the People heading 
on the left sidebar of the Chatter app.
To follow people, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Chatter tab from the home page.
The Main Chatter feed appears.
2.	 From the left sidebar, click the People heading.
The People heading expands to show the All People subsection.
FIGURE 6-3:  
Selecting fields on 
objects to follow.

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      101
3.	 Click the All People subheading.
The All People list appears.
4.	 Find people to follow using one of these methods:
•	 Find someone specific. Type that name (such as that of your CEO) into the 
Quick Find search bar. The list of people automatically updates while you’re 
typing. Look for key executives, peers, and other movers and shakers 
within your company.
•	 Browse for names. Scroll down the first page and click Next to see the next 
page of names.
Be picky about whom you follow first so that you don’t get overwhelmed with 
all the updates you’ll be getting in your feed.
Figure 6-4 shows a list of people and whether you’re following them.
When you click a person’s name, you go to his or her Profile page.
5.	 After you locate someone you want to follow, click the Follow link that 
appears in his row.
You’re now following that person, and the link toggles to Unfollow in case you 
want to unfollow him in the future. By default, the followed person receives an 
email notifying him that you’re following him so that he can likewise choose to 
follow you back — or not. His posts now show up in your Chatter feed as long 
as you have your feed unhidden.
Your secret is safe
Only internal users of your company’s Salesforce instance can see your Chatter 
posts and comments, depending on where you enter that update. (Read through 
the earlier section for more information on how to update your status.)
FIGURE 6-4:  
Finding people to 
follow.

102      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
As far as having outsiders or Google see your updates, you’re safe because Chatter 
uses the built-in privacy and security functionality of Salesforce. Internal users 
can see whatever you post, if they have access to the record you’re posting on or 
about. So if you post from your home page that you’re looking for a notary, every-
one can see that (what’s the point if they can’t?). But if you’re on the Opportunity 
record for “Big Secret Government Deal” and make a post there asking about a 
notary, only people who can see that opportunity will be able to see your post.
Following feeds
One of the key differentiators of Chatter, as compared with other social network-
ing sites — or other services that attempt to bring social networking into the 
workplace — is that you can also follow nonhuman things in your Salesforce 
database. Sounds crazy, right? This feature means that you can follow specific 
opportunities, accounts, contacts, leads, price lists, cases, and any changes that 
are made to those records. You can even create or follow groups, focused on a 
single competitor, region, or vertical. Being able to choose what things you want 
to stay in the loop about makes Chatter highly relevant to what you need to be 
successful at work.
To follow a record feed, click the Follow link under the record’s name on the 
record’s detail page. Below that link you’ll see who else is following that record.
Whenever someone changes a tracked field in an opportunity, for example, you 
know about it. If you’re a sales manager, you can choose to follow a strategic 
opportunity that one of your reps has been toiling over. The moment she updates 
that Opportunity Stage field to a Closed-Win, it appears in your feed. If you have 
key executives following that opportunity, too, they can provide comments that 
amount to a virtual high-five for all to see.
When you follow a specific record (see Figure 6-5), your profile photo appears as 
a follower of this object on the record’s page so that others will know you’re inter-
ested in this record.
You can also add comments to specific records, just as you can with people you 
follow (see the earlier section, “Commenting on posts”). They appear in your feed 
on your home page and on the feed on the record’s page.
Only users with read access to a record will be able to see any posts that you make 
on that record. To read more about profiles and permissions, visit Chapter 21.

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      103
Being Part of a Group
Similar to finding people to follow, you search for groups to join. By following a 
group’s feed, you can collaborate with a specific subset of people within your 
company on a regular basis.
Posts made to a private Chatter group can be seen only by members of the group, 
system administrators, and those with the View All Data permission.
Understanding Salesforce Chatter groups
Chatter groups in Salesforce are subsets of people who collaborate on a project, 
event, or idea. You can create a Chatter group for all sorts of different projects. For 
example, that company retreat may warrant a Chatter group to broadcast updates 
and answer questions. A specific branch or office could have its own Chatter group. 
Similarly, you can create Chatter groups for a wide variety of use cases — product 
lines, organization-wide competitions, and so on. Just make sure that these groups 
are kept professional and don’t become a channel to talk about personal lives or 
your weekend plans.
FIGURE 6-5:  
Following­a

104      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
Joining a group
To find a group to join, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Chatter tab.
The Chatter feed appears.
2.	 Click the Groups heading in the left sidebar.
The Groups heading expands to show several subsections.
3.	 Select the Active Groups subheading.
A list of active groups appears. You can see which groups you’re a member of 
by looking at the Membership column to the right of the group’s name.
4.	 Use the search bar to look for specific group names.
While you type, the list automatically changes to show the results of your search.
If you don’t find a group that you want to join, create a new one yourself. 
See the next section, “Creating a new group,” on how to create a group 
from scratch.
5.	 Click a group’s name to view the Group detail page.
This provides more details about the group.
6.	 Click either of these two links:
•	 Join: Join a public group.
•	 Ask Owner: Ask the owner for permission to join a private group.
Creating a new group
Communication is key when working in teams. With groups, you can set up private 
feeds where team members can discuss their work outside their normal feed. This 
feature is extremely useful for sensitive projects to ensure that online conversations 
remain secure. You can set up public groups as well for less-confidential discussion.
To set up a new group, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Groups heading on the left sidebar of the Chatter tab.
The heading expands. The Recently Viewed Groups home page appears, listing 
existing groups.
2.	 Click the New Group button.
The New Group page appears.

CHAPTER 6  Collaborating in the Cloud      105
3.	 Type the name of your group.
4.	 Enter a description to further distinguish it from other groups.
5.	 Select whether you want to have this group automatically archived after 
90 days of inactivity.
6.	 Set the Group Access as Public or Private:
•	 Public: Anyone can join the group or see its feed.
•	 Private: Only members, system administrators, and people with the View 
All Data permission can see and add posts to the feed.
7.	 Click Save.
Your new group’s page appears. You can add members by clicking the Add/
Remove link on the right side.
Managing Chatter Notifications
If Chatter Emails was enabled by your system administrator when Salesforce 
Chatter was activated, you have the option to be notified via email whenever 
someone (or something) you’re following has made a post.
You can set your preferences as follows:
1.	 Choose Your Name ➪ My Settings ➪ Chatter ➪ Email Notifications.
2.	 Select the Receive Emails check box to ensure that you receive emails about 
updates.
3.	 Select the appropriate check boxes corresponding to the events for which 
you want to be notified, and how often.
4.	 Click Save.
Using Chatter Effectively
Here are a few ideas on how your company can benefit from Chatter if some people 
are reluctant to get onboard:
»
» Help Sales sell smarter. Follow key accounts and strategic opportunities. Ask 
others for references to help you close a specific deal. Create a group to team 
up to win against a competitor.

106      PART 2  Understanding Salesforce Features
»
» Market more effectively. Get feedback on updated presentations and other 
marketing materials by attaching them to status updates. Share noteworthy 
press mentions. Follow leads to find out more about which types of prospects 
are converting.
»
» Improve customer service. Receive and provide help on cases. Discuss 
potential work-arounds and technical solutions in a private group. Collaborate 
on creating the most succinct answer to common customer issues.
»
» Define a Chatter code of conduct. If you have different generations of 
employees at your company, they’re going to react very differently to this tool. 
Establish basic norms to ensure that this doesn’t turn into yet another 
medium to post cat photos.
»
» Install Chatter Desktop or Chatter Mobile. Get proactive alerts on your 
computer screen whenever someone or a record you’re following makes an 
update so that you’re never out of the loop.
»
» Skim posts from your mobile device.

Tracking Leads
O
ften, we hear frustrated salespeople say, “We could hit our numbers if we 
just had enough leads to fill our pipeline.” Leads are the building blocks 
by which many companies drive their sales.
Loosely defined, a lead is a person or a company that may be interested in your 
services. Some organizations refer to them as visitors because they haven’t shared 
any information about themselves yet. Others call them prospects because a lead 
has to be someone who has expressed interest in your service. Whatever your 
favorite terminology is, you can use leads to efficiently follow up on sales inqui-
ries, aggressively attack new markets, and vastly improve your sales pipeline.
In this chapter, you can discover all the basic tricks you need to convert leads into 
revenue. You need to get your existing leads into Salesforce, and update them 
when you follow up with them. Also, we discuss how to convert a lead into an 
actual opportunity that you can link to an account and a contact. For online mar-
keting or email managers or administrators, we devote an entire section to how 
you can manage and maintain your lead database. Finally, we review how to 
expand your leads with Data.com.
Chapter 7

110      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Introducing the Lead Record
A lead record consists of a number of fields that you use to capture information 
about a potential lead. A lead record has two primary modes:
»
» Edit: In Edit mode, you can modify the fields.
»
» Saved: In Saved mode, you can view the fields and related lists.
The standard record comes predefined with several fields. Most of the terms are 
immediately clear, but if you want specific definitions, click Help in the upper-
right corner of Salesforce. Here are the most important standard fields:
»
» Lead Owner: The person who owns the lead. If no one owns the lead, 
Salesforce can automatically place the lead in a queue or assign it to a specific 
individual (though we don’t recommend that, because users take vacations, 
get sick, or leave the company, and should always have a backup). You can 
then assign the lead to a group of users (for example, “Corporate Sales — 
West Region”), who can take leads in the order in which they arrive in 
the queue.
»
» Lead Status: One of three required fields on a lead record. Lead Status is a 
drop-down list of values, and this field is critical if you want to follow a 
standard lead process. We talk more about lead status in the nearby sidebar, 
“Building an effective lead process.”
»
» Lead Source: A standard, but not required, field on a lead record. If you use it, 
you can define and track the sources of your leads by using this field.
Lead sources are the originators of leads that come knocking at your door. These 
can be related to broad communication channels (a toll-free number, cold call, or 
web form, for example), more specific types of marketing venues (trade show, 
print ad, partner referral, and so on), or a blend of both. It’s up to you. Always 
remember to balance your desire to get really granular data with the tolerance of 
the users who often have but a few seconds to customize this field (alongside 
other fields). And if you really want to track granular details of where leads are 
coming from, seriously consider using campaigns or a third-party marketing 
automation tool, described further in Chapter 15.
When you first get a lead, you’ll likely want to qualify that lead to make sure that 
a sales opportunity really exists for you. For example, maybe you want to be 
certain that the lead has the budget and a real interest and isn’t just kicking tires. 
A marketing-qualified lead is a lead that meets your sales and marketing’s teams 
qualification requirements to hand over the discussion to a salesperson. Teams in 
the Marketing or Sales department can own this responsibility.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      111
You’ll have your own definition of what qualifies as a lead, so jot it down, and then 
seek out someone to customize your lead record. (See Chapter 17 for the how-to 
details on building fields, rearranging your layouts, and other design tricks.) 
You’ll have greater success with leads if you collect the right information.
Writing useful Help text and descriptions for each field you create is vital to a 
healthy customer relationship management (CRM) system. It may seem laborious 
at first, and you may write terribly unhelpful descriptions. But fast-forward 6 to 
18 months when new team members are scratching their heads wondering why 
certain fields were created and you can’t remember why. Do yourself and your 
teammates a favor: Write down who requested a field and for what purpose.
BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE LEAD PROCESS
The key to a successful lead program that contributes to sales is a well-constructed lead 
process built into your Lead Status drop-down list. Salesforce provides a default list of 
four statuses: Open, Contacted, Qualified, and Unqualified. These statuses may appear 
straightforward, but they require definition because those four choices may not mirror 
your process or your terminology. The good news is that after you define the statuses 
that relate to your business, your administrator can quickly modify the values. The 
­process starts with the Lead Status field, but it doesn’t end there.
Here are some additional suggestions for how you might construct your lean, mean, 
lead-generating machine:
•	 Create fields to capture qualification criteria.
•	 Make it clear at what point in the process a lead should be converted to an 
opportunity.
•	 Decide who’ll manage the lead program and what that entails. Usually that’s the 
same person who sends out email campaigns. Make sure that he or she has suffi-

Setting Up Your Leads
Before you can begin working your leads, you need to add the lead records into 
Salesforce. In the following sections, we show you three quick approaches for lead 
creation, and if needed, how to share your leads with the right people. If you want 
to capture leads from your website, see Chapter 15 for details on generating Web-
to-Lead forms.
Adding new leads
The best way to manually create a lead is to use the Create New drop-down list on 
the sidebar. To create a lead using this method, follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Create Lead item from the Create New drop-down list.
A New Lead page appears in Edit mode, as shown in Figure 7-1. The only 
prefilled field is the Lead Status field.
2.	 Fill in the fields as much as you can.
At a minimum, you must complete the Last Name and Company fields.
You can add a list of target companies as leads, even if you don’t yet know the 
names of the right people. In certain cases, you may have only the name of a 
company because you know you want to target it, but you don’t yet know 
whom to call. You can work with incomplete information. In these cases, we 
recommend that you type ? or unknown in the Last Name field so that you 
know this information is missing.
FIGURE 7-1:

lead record.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      113
3.	 When you’re done, click the Save button or the Save & New button.
Here’s the difference between those two buttons:
•	 Save: When you click Save, the lead record appears in Saved mode, and 
your changes are displayed in the fields.
•	 Save & New: Salesforce knows that salespeople commonly add multiple 
leads before working them. When you click Save & New, the lead is saved, 
and a New Lead page appears in Edit mode.
When entering or editing records, click the Save button or the Save & New button 
when you’re done. Otherwise, you don’t save the information that you just typed 
for that record. If you make this mistake and haven’t yet logged out of Salesforce, 
try clicking the Back button on your browser (as opposed to hitting your head in 
frustration), which should get you back to the record in Edit mode. Then click Save 
and breathe a sigh of relief.
Cloning an existing lead
If you’re developing relationships within a particular company and you want to 
enter multiple leads for that company, you can save time by cloning leads. For 
example, say that you already created a lead record for Sergey Brin at Google. 
When you talk to his assistant, he courteously refers you to Larry Page. In this 
case, cloning can save you many extra steps.
To clone a lead record from an existing lead, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Clone button at the top of the lead record.
A new lead record appears in Edit mode. All the information is identical to the 
previous lead record.
2.	 Edit the information on the new lead, where appropriate.
Pay attention to what’s prefilled because you want to avoid inaccurate 
information on the new lead record.
3.	 Click Save when you’re done.
The newly created lead reappears in Saved mode. To verify this, click the link to 
the older lead, which you can find in the Recent Items section on the sidebar.
Importing your leads
If you already have a file of leads, you probably want a faster way to get them into 
Salesforce than entering them manually. You need special permissions to import 

114      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
leads (as well as other types of records), so if you’re able to do this, find your 
administrator, tell her what you’re trying to do, and have her provide you with the 
“import leads” permission.
Although you can import up to 50,000 leads at once, test an import with 5 or so 
leads first, just to make sure that you know what you’re doing. After the test data 
is imported, review your new lead records to make sure that they contain all the 
information that you want to have brought in. Delete the test records, refine your 
import file, and then run through the final import.
If you’re a new salesperson who just came from a competitor and you happened to 
bring all your leads with you to upload into your new company’s CRM system, 
hold up. Dumping tens of thousands of pieces of unreviewed data into your nice 
CRM system is terrible practice. You’re just moving potentially dirty data from an 
old home into a new one. Think that’s someone else’s problem? Just wait until 
people start going through it and finding quadruplicates, old job titles, and other 
pollution. Instead, take a more measured approach. Can you name the top 50 
companies that you should be targeting? See how many leads are from any of 
those companies, and start with that as an upload. Broaden your range slowly.
To import lead files, follow these steps:
1.	 On the Leads home page, click the Import Leads link at the bottom of the 
page, below the Tools heading.
The Data Import Wizard appears, providing you with a process to import your 
records, plus helpful hints.
2.	 In your existing lead file or system, compare your fields against the lead 
fields in Salesforce. Map all your fields between your current system and 
Salesforce.
If you can map all the necessary fields, move to the next step. If not, add fields 
to the lead record by customizing Salesforce. (See Chapter 17 for simple 
instructions on adding fields.)
While someone is mapping the fields from your current system to Salesforce, 
you should also be talking with your company about cleaning up that data. 
Now’s a good time to discuss which of your current system’s fields are still 
needed in the new world. Some fields may have been used several years ago, 
but no one’s been filling them in since you can remember, and no one’s 
bothered to remove or hide them from the current system. Even worse, no 
one can recall what those fields were for, or maybe you have multiple fields 
with very similar names! Also, you could have lots of duplicate or partial 
records. Talk with your company and your Salesforce consultant about best 
approaches to cleaning up this information.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      115
Mapping is a technical term for matching one field to another field, typically in 
different databases, to properly move data. For example, in Microsoft Outlook, 
you type a corporation’s name into the Company field. In Salesforce, you 
typically use the Account Name field. These two different labels have the same 
meaning. Mapping is the process by which you decide that data from the 
Company field in Outlook should correspond to the Account Name field in 
Salesforce.
3.	 Export your file.
You may have leads in an existing database or spreadsheet, such as Microsoft 
Excel, Oracle CRM On Demand, or Microsoft Dynamics. Most systems like 
these have simple tools for exporting data into various formats. Select the 
records and the fields that you want. Then, export the file and save it in a .csv 
format. If your leads are already in spreadsheet format (such as Excel), just 
resave the file in .csv format.
4.	 Review your lead data.
You’ve probably heard the old adage “garbage in, garbage out.” Regardless of 
whether your company spent some time with initial housecleaning before this 
step, it’s important to review the data again at this point. Clean up your 
information before you bring it into Salesforce so that you can save yourself 
the effort later.
5.	 When you’re done with the preparation, click Launch Wizard on the Data 
Import Wizard.
The first page of the Data Import Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 7-2. In 
the first step, the wizard wants to confirm what type of data you’ll be 
importing. In this example, we select Leads. The progress bar moves along to 
the second step.
FIGURE 7-2:  
Uploading the 
lead file.

116      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
6.	 Complete the fields in Step 2 of the wizard.
The wizard next asks what you want to do in your import. You choose whether 
you’re adding new records, updating existing ones, or a combination of both.
Assuming that you already prepared your file, follow these steps:
a.	 Select the matching type.
If you want Salesforce to avoid importing duplicate records, choose whether 
you want to identify a duplicate lead by matching Salesforce ID, name, or 
email. If a lead record with the matching criteria already exists in Salesforce, 
that record is updated with the information in your file.
b.	 Select a default lead source, if relevant.
c.	 Apply an assignment rule if you want leads to route directly to assigned reps.
If you don’t use an assignment rule, all the leads that you import are 
assigned to you unless you otherwise specify a lead owner in the file. (See 
the section “Creating assignment rules for automatic routing,” later in 
this chapter.)
d.	 Select the check box if you want to use assignment rule settings to send email 
notifications to the record owners.
e.	 Select the check box if you want assign all the leads to campaigns.
f.	 Select the check box if you want to trigger workflow rules and processes to new 
and updated records.
See Chapter 17 for tips on improving workflow.
g.	 When asked where your data is located, either drag your file from your 
computer’s desktop to the “Drag CSV file here to upload” section, or select one of 
the file options depending on the file’s original source (like CSV, Outlook CSV, 
Gmail, and so on).
7.	 When you’re done with this part of the wizard, click Next.
The Edit Field Mapping page appears for this object.
8.	 Map the fields between your file and Salesforce and then click Next.
The Edit Field Mapping page displays all the Salesforce lead fields in a column 
that correspond to the fields in your file. Simply go through the list of fields and 
select the field from the corresponding file that you’re importing that maps to 
the Salesforce field, as shown in Figure 7-3. Any column headings in your 
source file that don’t have an obvious Salesforce equivalent will be identified 
with the word Unmapped in red letters.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      117
After you click Next, the Review and Start Import page appears if you have no 
possible errors. Otherwise, this step may bring up warnings about problems 
with the data or let you know about fields that you haven’t mapped. If you 
discover an error, you can click the Back button and refine your mapping, 
or even close the wizard so that you can improve your import file. You may 
have to start over, but at least you avoid importing bad or incomplete data.
A summary of information about the import is displayed, confirming what 
fields will and won’t be imported, and what type of import you’ll be doing.
9.	When you’re satisfied with the summary, click the Start Import button.
A pop-up window appears to let you know that the import is in progress. Click 
OK to close that window and get sent to the Bulk Data Load Job page, which 
identifies the progress of the import.
10.	Check the lead records that you imported.
Salesforce sends you an email after your file has been successfully imported. 
To check your handiwork, click the Leads tab to go to your Leads home page. 
In the View drop-down list, select Today’s Leads to see a list of the leads that 
were created today. Click the link for a lead that you just imported and review 
the information for accuracy.
Importing leads is one of the fastest ways for you to set up your leads in Salesforce 
so that you can begin working them.
FIGURE 7-3:

118      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Accepting Leads from a Queue
If you’re a rep assigned to a queue, you can access the queue in the View drop-
down list on the Leads home page. The queue list page looks just like a regular list 
page, but you can use it to grab and claim leads. (See the section “Making use of 
lead queues,” later in this chapter, for details on setting up queues.)
To pull leads from a queue and make them your own, go to the Leads home page 
and follow these steps:
1.	 Select the queue name from the View drop-down list.
The queue list page appears.
2.	 Select check boxes in the Action column to the left of leads that you want 
to claim.
Your manager may have specific guidelines. This is your chance to click into 
some records and try to pick the hottest leads.
3.	 Click the Accept button.
The queue list page reappears, minus the lead(s) that you selected.
Another way to keep your leads organized is to make sure that multiple versions 
of the same person don’t show up in Salesforce. This can wreak havoc as people 
update activity information on different records for the same person. Salesforce 
detects whether duplicate records already exist and merges them for you. Read the 
next section to see how to deduplicate lead records.
BREAKING INTO UNCHARTED WATERS
A leading Internet performance-monitoring company wanted to sell its services to a 
variety of new, untested markets. This Salesforce.com customer had a stronghold in 
financial services but wanted to extend its client base to other Fortune 500 companies. 
Because of the specific nature of its business, the actual names of the decision makers 
that it wanted to target was publicly unavailable.
Marketing simply imported the Fortune 500 list and set the Last Name field as 
Unknown. Then, the company used Salesforce and a team of sales development reps to 
generate leads and set up appointments between actual buyers and the company’s 
­outside field sales reps. In just a few short months, this use of Salesforce dramatically 
helped improve qualified lead generation and increased the pipeline and new bookings 
while breaking ground in new markets.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      119
Following Up on Leads
After you receive a new lead, you want a quick way to follow up and determine 
what you caught: a big one, a warm one, or just another person kicking tires. Your 
company may already have a standard lead qualification process, but the following 
sections talk about some of the ways that you can use Salesforce to pursue leads.
Tracking leads with related lists
How can you remember all the interactions that took place with a lead? Some of us 
have a hard enough time remembering what we did yesterday, let alone three 
weeks ago with 200 leads. Related lists on a lead record can help you capture all 
that information so that it’s at your fingertips the next time you talk to a lead.
If you’re looking for typical ways that salespeople use lead-related lists on a lead 
record, read the following list for an example:
»
» Log a Call: The next time you respond to a lead and want to record what you 
said, click the Log a Call button and enter the details.
»
» New Task: You plan to call the lead back next Friday when you know that the 
gatekeeper is on vacation. Click New Task and set a tickler for yourself for 
Friday. (See Chapter 5 for details on how to fill out a new task record.)
»
» Send an Email: You get through to the lead, and he asks you to send him an 
introductory email about your company. Click the Send an Email button to 
send and track the email directly from Salesforce. We talk more about sending 
email through Salesforce in Chapter 5.
»
» New Event: The lead agrees to a demo. Click New Event and schedule a 
meeting so that you don’t forget.
At some point, you may decide that a lead can’t become a qualified opportunity at 
this time. In that case, you can archive the lead by changing its status. Archiving 
inactive leads allows you to get a sense of how many leads are still being worked.
Converting qualified leads
When you decide that a lead is actually a qualified opportunity, you can start using 
Salesforce’s full opportunity tracking system. To do so, you must convert the lead 
to an opportunity. This conversion gives you two benefits:
»
» It allows you to track multiple contacts within an account, which you 
can do more easily than tracking a single individual lead. In other words, 

120      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
if you have ten leads from Microsoft, they aren’t linked with each other in 
Salesforce. But, by converting a lead, you create an account called Microsoft 
and you link all the Microsoft co-workers as contacts for the same account.
»
» Your goal is to ABC (always be closing), so the sooner you can start 
managing opportunities and not just leads, the healthier your pipeline 
and wallet. For a qualified lead, your sales process begins where your lead 
process ends.
When deciding whether to add names of companies or businesspeople as leads or 
as accounts with contacts, remember that the leads module of Salesforce is non-
relational from lead to lead. If you’re serious about going after a particular com-
pany, and the interrelationships of business contacts will be important, we 
recommend that you add the target as an account, rather than as a lead.
To convert a lead to an opportunity, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Convert button on a lead record that you want to convert.
The Convert button is located at the top and bottom of the lead record. A 
Convert Lead page appears (see Figure 7-4).
2.	 Complete the required fields.
Required fields are highlighted in red. Here’s a summary:
•	 Record Owner: If the lead owner remains the record owner, don’t change 
the selection. If the owner changes, click the Lookup icon and choose from 
the list of users. Select the Send Email to the Owner check box, if needed.
FIGURE 7-4:  
Converting a lead.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      121
•	 Account Name: If Salesforce doesn’t find an account that closely matches 
the Company field from your lead, it creates a new account record. In the 
event that it does find a match, select an option from the drop-down list, 
depending on whether you want to create a new account or associate the 
lead to the existing account.
•	 Opportunity Name: If you want to create an opportunity, complete this field 
by giving the opportunity a name. (We typically recommend that the name 
of an opportunity be the account name followed by a hyphen and then a 
summary of the product interest — for example: Amazon – New 
Hardware.) You don’t have to always create an opportunity record when 
you convert a lead. Sometimes, the lead that you’re converting is 
associated with an existing opportunity. In these situations, select the Do 
Not Create a New Opportunity upon Conversion check box to avoid 
creating a new opportunity.
•	 Converted Status: Salesforce prefills this field with the default value that 
your company has chosen for a qualified lead. Don’t change this field 
unless your company has multiple selections for a qualified lead.
•	 Task Information: You can create a follow-up task right in these fields, but 
you don’t have to. Complete these fields only if it saves you a step.
3.	 When you’re done, click the Convert button.
If Salesforce finds a contact record that matches your lead, you can decide 
to associate it with the existing contact record. Otherwise, a contact record 
appears for your former lead. That contact is linked to an account 
corresponding to the lead’s Company field, and all associated records from 
related lists are carried over. If you chose to create an opportunity in Step 2, 
you can see the opportunity on both the account and contact record’s 
Opportunity related lists.
Maintaining Your Lead Database
If you’re a system administrator or a lead manager who has the right permissions 
(we specify those permissions in the following sections), one of your greatest 
challenges is managing what hopefully will become a large pool of leads.
Lead databases can become unwieldy over time, so you need to keep them clean. For 
example, say that you work for a company that regularly collects leads from industry 
conferences. Someone who hadn’t read this book ended up importing a lot of leads 
into Salesforce without any review beforehand. After a year, your leads database 
may have many duplicates and plenty of garbage. Salesforce provides a number of 
simple tools to make short work of cleaning up your leads and other tasks.

122      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
The biggest problems we see with leads involve creating a regular cadence around 
assigning, identifying duplicate records, merging them together (also known as 
deduping), transferring, archiving, and deleting. We know: You hate to get rid of 
anything. However, sometimes it’s necessary and relatively painless.
Making use of lead queues
If you have a sales team made up of multiple people (often called sales develop-
ment reps [SDRs]) responsible for harvesting leads collectively, you may want to 
set up lead queues. For example, some companies hire SDRs to handle leads on a 
first-come, first-served basis. You may just find that your reps work harder if 
they all have an equal chance to go after a fresh pool of leads.
If you’re an administrator or user who has permission to customize Salesforce, 
you can set up lead queues. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Manage Users ➪ Queues.
A Queues page appears.
2.	 Click New to create a new queue.
The New Queue page appears in Edit mode, as shown in Figure 7-5.
FIGURE 7-5:  
Creating a new 
lead queue.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      123
3.	 Name the queue and specify the Lead object to associate with this queue.
4.	 Add members to the queue.
Members can be users, groups, or roles in your company who’ll be part of the 
queue. For example, you may label the queue Western Field Sales and then 
choose users who make up the Western Sales team.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save.
You can now use this queue when you organize and reassign lead records.
Lead queues can be viewed in the same place on your Leads home page where you 
view your lead views. The name of the lead queue is automatically added to the 
drop-down list for the lead views. Pretty neat, huh?
Finding and merging duplicate lead records
Before following up on a new lead, click the Find Duplicates button on the specific 
lead record to see whether a record already exists. You probably know that 
duplicates frequently occur with leads. For example, if you capture leads from 
your website, the same visitor may fill in your web form multiple times, even with 
the best of intentions. Instead of wasting your time or upsetting the existing lead, 
check first for duplicates.
By checking for duplicates, you may increase your chances of a qualified lead. 
When you merge duplicate records, the remaining record inherits not only the 
information you select but also linked records on related lists.
To merge lead records, you must be the lead owner of the records, the lead own-
er’s manager (that is, the lead owner must be subordinate to you in the role hier-
archy), or a system administrator.
To find and merge duplicate leads, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to a lead record that you suspect or know has duplicates.
2.	 Click the Find Duplicates button at the top of the lead record.
A Search for Duplicates page appears, in five sections. The first section 
determines how you want to search Salesforce for duplicates. By default, 
Salesforce looks for a duplicate with a matching name, company, email 
address, or phone number. The remaining four sections show any matching 
lead, contact, account, or opportunity records, based on the default matching 
criteria.

124      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
3.	 Select or deselect search criteria boxes to narrow or expand your search. 
Click the Search button to return updated results.
Records matching any of the selected search criteria appear in their appropri-
ate sections.
4.	 Review the duplicate lead records and select a maximum of three records 
to merge.
In Salesforce, you can merge only three records at a time.
5.	 Click the Merge Leads button in the Matching Leads related list.
A Merge Leads page appears, displaying, side by side, the selected records and 
their fields.
6.	 Compare the information and select the radio buttons to choose the values 
that you want to retain.
At the top of each column, you can also choose to keep all the values from one 
record by clicking the Select All link.
7.	 When you finish reviewing, click the Merge button.
A pop-up window appears, prompting you to validate that you want to perform 
the merge. After you click OK, the merged lead reappears. Any records from 
related lists are kept.
Minimize the subjective decision making that needs to happen when an  
end-user is reviewing conflicting criteria within matching leads. Do this by 
establishing some clear rules to your teams so they don’t get frustrated 
spending time trying to re-research everything. For example, if there is 
contradictory employee size information in duplicate records, establish that 
the tiebreaking field is the one whose data most closely matches the employee 
size as reported in Data.com, or some other master source of truth.
Creating assignment rules  
for automatic routing
If your company generates a lot of leads, assignment rules can help distribute the 
workload and get leads to the right users. Assignment rules give you a better 
chance to keep leads from becoming stagnant. A lead assignment rule is a feature 
that lets the administrator define who should receive a lead and under what con-
ditions. For example, if your reps have sales territories defined by zip codes or 
countries, you can use those zip codes or countries to dictate who gets what leads.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      125
To create a lead assignment rule, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ Leads ➪ Lead Assignment Rules.
If you haven’t yet set the default lead owner, the Lead Settings page appears, 
asking you to select the default lead owner. The buck stops with this person or 
queue, as far as lead routing goes. After you make this selection, Salesforce 
returns you to the Lead Assignment Rules page.
2.	 Click New to create a new assignment rule.
The New Lead Assignment Rule page appears in Edit mode.
3.	 Enter a title in the Rule Name field, select the check box if you want to make 
it the active assignment rule, and click the Save button.
The Lead Assignment Rule page reappears. You can have only one active rule 
at a time, but the rule can have multiple entries. Click the rule name to go to 
the detail page for that rule.
4.	 Click New in the Rule Entries related list.
A Rule Entry Edit page appears.
5.	 Complete the steps as follows:
a.	 Enter a number in the Order field to set the order in which the rules will be 
evaluated.
b.	 Select criteria to define the rule.
See Chapter 17 for details on selecting criteria. In this case, you might enter 
ZIP Code Equals 02474.
c.	 Use the drop-down list and Lookup icon to select the user or queue.
d.	 Use the Lookup icon to choose an Email Notification Template.
You can set the assignment rules to send email alerts to recipients of 
new leads.
6.	 When done, click the Save button or the Save & New button.
Here’s what happens when you click each button:
•	 Save: When you click Save, the New Lead Assignment Rule page reappears.
•	 Save & New: When you click Save & New, a new Rule Entry Edit page 
appears, and you can repeat Steps 5 and 6 until you finish.
Transferring leads
You may need to transfer leads for a variety of reasons. For instance, after you set 
up your lead records in Salesforce, you need to give them to the right people on a 

126      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
different team. Or maybe some reps just weren’t following up, so you took their 
leads away after swatting their noses with a rolled-up newspaper.
To transfer leads, you must be an administrator or a user with Manage Leads and 
Transfer Leads permissions. If you want to reassign many leads at the same time, 
take these steps:
1.	 From the Leads home page, select a view from which you can see some 
leads that you want to reassign.
The list page appears.
2.	 In the Action column of the lead list, select the check boxes to the left of the 
lead records that you want to assign to someone else.
3.	 Click the Change Owner button at the top of the page.
The Change Lead Owner page appears.
4.	 Select the user or queue that you intend to reassign leads to, and then 
click Save.
The lead list reappears, and the lead owners have been changed. The new lead 
owner can be optionally notified via email of this ownership change. Just select 
the Send Notification Email check box before clicking the Save button.
If you’re an administrator, you can use the Mass Transfer Leads tool in Setup to 
accomplish the same goals of reassigning en masse. See Chapter 22 for details on 
mass-transferring leads.
If you’re reassigning one lead at a time, you can transfer ownership directly from 
a lead record. Follow these steps:
1.	 On the lead record, to the right of the Lead Owner field, click the 
Change link.
The link is in square brackets. The Change Lead Owner page appears.
2.	 Select the user or queue that you’re assigning the lead to.
You use this same page when you’re assigning multiple leads.
3.	 (Optional) Select the Send Notification check box to notify the new owner of 
the reassignment.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The lead record reappears, displaying your ownership change.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      127
Changing the status of multiple records
An administrator or a user who has Manage Leads permissions can change the 
status of multiple records at the same time. This feature comes in handy if, during 
a process, a lead manager reviews leads prior to assigning them to reps.
To change the status of multiple leads at the same time, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Leads home page, select a view.
The list page appears.
2.	 In the Action column of the lead list, select the check boxes to the left of the 
lead records that require a status change.
To select all the leads in this view, select the check box to the left of the Action 
column header, which selects all the leads on this page.
For example, if you’re eyeballing a list of leads from a trade show, you might 
select obviously bogus leads.
3.	 Click the Change Status button at the top of the page.
The Change Status page appears.
4.	 Select a status from the New Status drop-down list and click Save.
The lead list reappears.
If you require industrial-strength deduplication tools, a number of proven tech-
nology partners handle deduplication within Salesforce, plus a variety of other 
data management tasks. You can check out these offerings on the AppExchange 
directory by searching for “data cleansing” in the search bar.
Mass-deleting lead records
Periodically, be sure to delete records that are unqualified or of no value to your 
company. You must be an administrator to mass-delete records.
Some companies add a To Be Deleted value to their Lead Status field to denote 
garbage. Then, periodically, the administrator deletes those records.
If you want to delete multiple records at a time, follow these steps:
1.	 On the Leads home page, click the Mass Delete Leads link below the 
Tools heading.
A Mass Delete Leads page appears, including a three-step deletion wizard.

128      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
2.	 Review the steps and then type the search criteria for the leads that you 
want to delete.
For example, if you want to delete unqualified leads, enter a filter in which 
Lead Status Equals Unqualified.
3.	 Click the Search button.
The page reappears, displaying your results at the bottom of the page.
4.	 Select all records or just the records that you want to delete by selecting the 
appropriate check boxes.
To select all the search results for deletion, click the Select All link at the top of 
the list.
5.	 Click the Delete button after you complete selecting the records for deletion.
The search results are updated to omit the record(s) you deleted.
When deleting records, always be cautious, but don’t overly stress out. When you 
delete records, that information is placed in your Recycle Bin, and you can access 
records for 15 days. To undelete a record, click the Recycle Bin link on your sidebar, 
find the record, and undelete it. Then, count your blessings and breathe into a 
paper bag until the panic attack subsides.
Building Your Lead Database  
with Data.com
Data.com (www.data.com) is an online source of millions of business professionals 
and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) information about companies. It’s used to compare, 
update, and clean lead information in your Salesforce org, against information 
that exists with D&B. Data.com’s partnership with D&B provides industrial-
strength, third-party validation of lead information, because many people who 
sign up for things online can often use as little real information as possible when 
they’re in the early stages of researching a product. Data.com has several product 
lines that meet different needs and varying budgets.
Here’s a high-level overview on how it works:
1.	 From within Salesforce, Data.com flags any of your lead data when a 
discrepancy exists between the information you have and what’s 
in Data.com.

CHAPTER 7  Tracking Leads      129
You get to choose which lead fields Data.com reviews to determine this and 
which flagged records you want to be updated. Don’t worry: You can also lock 
certain records so they’re not reviewed.
2.	 You can mine Data.com for new leads based on certain criteria (like 
Industry = Manufacturing, State = California, Company Revenue = 
$500 ­million–$1 billion ) that you choose, to build your own custom 
­prospecting list.
Data.com searches its database for matches and adds them to your Salesforce 
database on a regular basis.
3.	 Companies using Data.com, especially its data sourced from D&B, use this 
information as an objective source of truth when it comes to deciding on 
what data in a field is more trustworthy.
So, if one sales rep swears that a company has enough employees to 
categorize that account as his, but Data.com’s employee size is different, you 
can go with what’s in Data.com and assign that account to its rightful owner.
Data.com has a few different products to help with each aspect of deduping or list 
building. To get more information, visit its website at www.data.com.

Using Accounts
W
ho are your customers? What do you know about them? What are their 
top compelling business problems? If you have trouble answering any 
of these questions, pay close attention to this chapter. Here, we discuss 
how to use Salesforce to manage your accounts.
In Salesforce, an account is a company that you do business with or have done 
business with in the past. Accounts can include all types of companies — customers, 
prospects, partners, and even competitors. Among the top reasons why companies 
implement any customer relationship management (CRM) tool is that they need a 
centralized place where they can store account data, to prevent themselves from 
searching all over the place for critical customer information. With Salesforce, you 
can keep all your important account information in one place so that you and your 
team can apply that knowledge to sell more and keep customers happy. For exam-
ple, if you work for a pharmaceutical company, you can use the accounts area to 
manage your territory of hospitals, clinics, and top offices and capture everything 
from call reports to business plans.
In this chapter, we describe all the ways you can use accounts to manage and track 
companies. First, you need to get your important company lists into Salesforce 
and organize them according to the way that you work. Then, you can find out 
how to make the best use of the account record to profile your companies. Finally, 
you can discover how to capitalize on the account-related lists to gain a 360-degree 
view of your customers and ensure that no one drops any balls.
Chapter 8

132      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Getting Familiar with  
the Account Record
You use an account record to collect all the critical information about the companies 
with which you interact. That account record is supported by other records (con-
tacts, opportunities, cases, activities, and so on) that collectively give you a com-
plete view of your customer. From this vantage point, you can quickly take in the 
view from the top, but you can also easily drill down into the details.
Here’s a short list of valuable things you can do with accounts:
»
» Import and consolidate your lists of target accounts in one place.
»
» Enter new accounts quickly and maintain naming consistency.
»
» Create parent/child relationships that describe how companies’ divisions or 
subsidiaries relate to each other.
»
» Realign sales territories.
»
» Segment your markets with ease.
»
» Eliminate paper-based business planning.
»
» Assign account teams to better serve your customers.
»
» Track your top customers and deemphasize nonstrategic ones.
»
» Define the movers and shakers within an account.
»
» Monitor information from your account’s social network.
»
» Manage your channel partners.
Understanding standard account fields
An account record comprises fields that make up the information on a company 
that you’re tracking. A record has two modes:
»
» Edit: You can modify fields.
»
» Saved: You can view the fields and the account’s related lists, which are 
located below the record fields.

CHAPTER 8  Using Accounts      133
An account record also comes preconfigured with a set of fields commonly used 
for account management. Most of the standard fields are self-explanatory, but in 
the following list, we highlight certain terms that warrant greater definition:
»
» Account Owner: This required field identifies the person in your organization 
who owns the account. An account record has only one owner, but many 
users can still collaborate on an account.
»
» Account Name: This required field represents the name of the company you 
want to track.
»
» Account Site: The Account Site field goes hand in hand with the Account Name 
field when you’re distinguishing different physical locations or divisions of a 
company. This field, although not required, is very important if your company 
sells to different locations of a customer with decentralized buying patterns. 
For example, if you sell mattresses to HappyDaze Hotels but each HappyDaze 
hotel buys independently, this field is useful for classifying different sites.
»
» Type: This is one of the fields on an account record that classifies the relation-
ship of an account to your company. The Type field consists of a drop-down 
list of values, which can prove critical if you want to differentiate types of 
companies. For example, if you work for a software company that uses 
value-added resellers (VARs) to sell and service your products, you may want 
to select Reseller as one of your drop-down list values.
»
» Rating: Use this drop-down list to define your internal rating system for 
companies that you’re tracking. Salesforce provides default values of Hot, 
Warm, and Cold, but you can replace these with numbers, letters, or other 
terms based on how you want to segment companies.
See Chapter 17 for instructions on customizing account fields, such as the Type 
and Rating picklists.
Building parent/child relationships
If you sell into different locations or divisions of a company and you’re currently 
challenged by how to keep this information organized, use account hierarchies to 
solve your problem. In Salesforce, you can link multiple offices of a company 
together by using the Parent Account field on an account record. And you can cre-
ate multiple tiers to the hierarchy if your customer is organized that way.
To establish parent/child relationships, follow these steps:
1.	 Create accounts for the parent and subsidiary companies.
If you need help with this step, turn to Chapter 5 for information on how to 
­create new records.

134      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
You can skip this step if the accounts are already created. However, you may 
want to type a term such as Headquarters or HQ in the Account Site field to 
signify which account is the parent.
2.	 Click the link in your Recent Items list in the left sidebar for the subsidiary 
account (a child account) that you want to link and then click Edit.
If it’s not in the Recent Items list, search and find the child account you want to 
link and click Edit.
The record appears in Edit mode.
3.	 To the right of the Parent Account field, click the Lookup icon.
A pop-up window appears, containing a Search field and a list of recently 
viewed accounts.
If you see the parent account in the most-recently viewed results list, skip to 
Step 5.
4.	 Search for the parent account by typing the name of the account in the 
Search field and then clicking Go.
5.	 From the list of results, click the name of the company to select the parent 
account (as shown in Figure 8-1).
The pop-up window closes, and your selection appears in the Parent Account 
field.
6.	 (Optional) To further denote the child account, use the Account Site field.
Some companies use city, state, country, division, and so on, depending on 
how they organize their accounts. For example, if Big Box Office Supplies, Inc., 
has locations in Dallas and Atlanta, you could type the city into the Account Site 
field for each child account so that you can tell which is which.
7.	 Click Save.
The child Account detail page appears.
FIGURE 8-1:  
Select a sample 
parent account.

CHAPTER 8  Using Accounts      135
8.	 To view the account hierarchy, click the View Hierarchy link to the right of 
the Account Name field on the child account record.
An Account Hierarchy list page appears, and like other lists, you can click an 
item to go to a specific account.
Performing Actions with Account  
Related Lists
Fields on an account record are useful for storing important data specific to a 
company. But where do you go to capture all the critical interactions and relation-
ships when you’re working an account? To keep track of these details, use the 
related lists located on the Account detail page.
Many of the actions on account related lists are common to other modules. For 
example, major modules, such as Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, and Cases, 
all have related lists for Open Activities, Activity History, and Notes & Attach-
ments. Instead of being redundant, we point you to Chapter 5 for details on using 
related lists to track tasks and calendar events. In the following sections, we 
describe certain related lists that are unique to the account record.
Defining contact roles
Many sales reps do a great job of collecting business cards for contacts within an 
account, but this action alone doesn’t get them closer to a sale. Contacts and their 
titles often don’t tell the whole story about decision makers and the chain of com-
mand within an account. To use contact roles in Salesforce, your administrator 
must proactively reveal this related list on the account record — you can find 
details on how to do this in Chapter 17.
To better define the buying influences on an account, go to an account record and 
follow these steps:
1.	 Review your records in the Contact related list.
If important contacts are missing, add them first, which we describe in Chapter 9.
2.	 Click the New button on the Contact Roles related list.
The Account Contact Role Edit page appears.
3.	 Type the name of a contact in the Contact field and then click the Lookup icon.
A pop-up window with your search results appears.

136      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
4.	 Find the correct contact:
•	 The contact is part of the search results. Click the link for that contact’s name.
•	 Your search doesn’t find the contact. Refine your search, or click the New 
button to create the contact record and then select the contact you find or 
create.
This is only true if “Quick Create” is enabled for your organization.
After you select the contact, the pop-up window disappears, and the Contact 
field is filled in.
5.	 Select the Correct Role from the Role drop-down list.
The default roles are strategic, rather than mere job titles. If the right role for 
your contact doesn’t appear, advise your system administrator to edit the 
roles. Many companies match these roles with their particular sales methodol-
ogy identifiers.
6.	 Select the Primary Contact check box if the contact is your primary 
contact; then click the Save button or the Save & New button:
•	 Save: The Account detail page reappears, and your contact appears on the 
Contact Roles related list for that account’s record.
•	 Save & New: A new Account Contact Role Edit page appears, and you can 
associate another contact to a role immediately.
Displaying an account’s opportunities
Over the course of managing an account, you’ll hopefully uncover specific oppor-
tunities to sell that company your products or services. You can use the Opportu-
nity related list to quickly perform the following tasks:
»
» Stay aware of all open opportunities that you and your team are pursuing on 
an account.
»
» Add new opportunities and link them automatically to the account.
»
» Edit and delete opportunity records with a single click.
»
» Gauge the progress of an account by quickly seeing all open and closed 
opportunities at their various sales stages and amounts.
See Chapter 10 for the scoop on managing opportunities.

CHAPTER 8  Using Accounts      137
Viewing cases
Account health is much more than measuring the growth of sales for a customer. 
After selling, sales reps want to stay informed of customer service issues so that 
they can continue to keep their customers satisfied, resolve issues early, receive 
warnings about potential landmines, and track potential upsell opportunities. Use 
the Cases related list to view all the open and closed customer service cases that 
relate to an account.
If your company relies on a channel sales team to manage partners, distribute 
leads, and bring in revenue, consider using Salesforce Communities, which is 
available in Enterprise and Performance editions for an extra charge. This partner 
relationship management (PRM) application gets your partners on board with 
using Salesforce to manage all the details of their activities with your company 
and your joint deals. Go to Chapter 12 for a more in-depth discussion.
Tracking your account teams
If you’re fortunate enough to work with large companies, you probably know that 
it takes a team of people to win complex deals and maintain large accounts. The 
Account Owner field may identify the primary person in charge, but often you 
need to know who to go to for a specific purpose, or maybe the account owner is 
just out sick. Account teams lets you list all the individuals at your company who 
work with an account and detail their specific roles.
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Accounts ➪ Account Teams.
The Account Team Setup page appears.
2.	 Click Enable Account Teams, select the Account Teams Enabled check box (as 
shown in Figure 8-2), and then click Save.
The Page Layout Selection page appears, allowing you to select all the Account 
page layouts to which you want to add the Account Teams related list. If you 
have account types (and layouts) that never require team collaboration, don’t 
add the related list to these.
3.	 Select the account page layouts to which you want to add the Account Teams 
related list and click Save.
The Account Team Setup page appears, where you can choose to define team 
roles for your organization. This step is optional.

138      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Now that Account Teams are enabled for your organization, to give credit to your 
team and make sure that others know whom to call, go to an account record and 
follow these steps:
1.	 Scroll down to the Account Team related list or click the Account Team 
hover link at the top of the page.
If you don’t see the Account Team related list, have your administrator activate 
the feature in Setup.
2.	 Click the Add button to add up to five team members.
The New Account Team Members page appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
3.	 Use the Team Member lookups to select fellow users of Salesforce who work 
on this account.
You can always go back and add more later.
4.	 (Optional) Specify the sharing access you want to give for this account, its 
opportunities, and its cases.
5.	 Select the appropriate role in the Team Role drop-down list.
6.	 Click Save.
You’re returned to the account record’s detail page with your account team listed.

CHAPTER 8  Using Accounts      139
Maintaining Your Account Database
The more you use Salesforce for account management, the more important it is to 
maintain it over time.
In the following sections, we show you simple tools for keeping your account 
database up to date.
Increasing account accuracy  
with Data.com
Everyone has his or her own way of entering a company name, but when each 
sales rep uses his own method, it leads to duplicate account records. Instead of 
arguing over whose method is best, you can use Data.com to provide you with the 
correct name.
Data.com provides top-quality data from Dun & Bradstreet and is available in 
Salesforce for an added charge. You can use it to automatically clean your account 
records, providing you with up-to-date information for 83 account fields. Sales 
reps can also use Data.com to instantly import new accounts and contacts into 
Salesforce. Whether you’re augmenting your existing data or starting from 
scratch, Data.com can provide the data you need without ever having to leave 
Salesforce.
Deleting account records
If you (or a subordinate) own accounts that need to be deleted, you can delete 
them one at a time by using the Delete button on the account records. The one 
caveat here is that some companies remove your permission to delete accounts 
altogether. If this is the case or if you want to delete many accounts at one time, 
consult with your system administrator. System administrators are the only users 
in your company who have the ability to mass-delete records. (Kind of startling to 
realize that geeks have all the power, isn’t it?)
When deleting account records, remember that you’re also deleting associated 
records. So, if you’re deleting an account, you can potentially be removing con-
tacts, activities, opportunities, and other records linked to the account. You can 
rectify a mistakenly deleted record within 15 days of your deletion by retrieving it 
from your Recycle Bin, but be careful before deleting records.

I
f you’ve been selling for more than a few years, you probably have a big golden 
list overflowing with business contacts. And if you’re just starting out, you 
probably wish you had one. But how much do you know about those contacts? 
Where do you keep track of the personal and business information that you’ve 
collected throughout the years?
Salesforce enables you to plan, manage, and capture all the important interactions 
that you normally have with your prospects and customers. Just imagine the value 
that keeping this shared information in one place can have for you and your teams.
By using the Contacts section in Salesforce, you can effectively keep all your most 
important contacts together in one place, easily link them with the accounts they 
work for, gain insight into the relationships between contacts, and capture the 
critical personal drivers of each contact that are so key to your selling success.
In this chapter, we discuss how to use Salesforce for your contact management 
needs. You can also find out how to build your contact database by adding infor-
mation directly or by importing your existing files. Later in the chapter, we 
describe how to organize your contacts lists so that you can quickly find the people 
you want to talk to. We also show you how to maintain the integrity of your con-
tact data by editing contact records, merging duplicate records, and deleting old 
records. These tasks allow you to start putting your contacts to work for you.
Chapter 9

142      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Understanding the Contact Record
A contact record is the collection of fields that consists of the information about a 
person you do business with. Unlike a business card or a lead record in Salesforce, 
however, a contact is linked to an account. Like other records, the contact record 
has two modes: an Edit mode, in which you can modify fields, and a Saved mode, 
in which you can view the fields and the contact’s related lists (which are located 
below the fields).
A contact record comes preconfigured with a standard set of fields commonly used 
for contact management. The exact number isn’t important because your com-
pany might add or subtract fields based on the way you want to track your con-
tacts. Most of the standard fields are self-explanatory, but in the following list, we 
highlight a few fields that are less obvious:
»
» Contact Owner: This is the person in your organization who owns the 
contact. A contact has only one owner, although many users can still collabo-
rate on a contact.
»
» Reports To: This lookup field on the contact record allows you to organize 
your contacts hierarchically.
»
» Lead Source: This drop-down list defines where you originated the contact.
»
» Email Opt Out: This check box reminds you whether a contact should be 
emailed.
»
» Do Not Call: This check box reminds you whether a contact can be called.
Privacy is a big issue with companies and the selling tactics they employ. Nothing 
damages a customer relationship more than a contact who’s contacted when he or 
she has asked not to be. To protect your contacts’ privacy, be diligent about the 
Email Opt Out and Do Not Call fields. Users in your company should always check 
the contact record before calling or marketing to a contact.
Customizing Contact Information
After you complete the standard fields, you never have trouble knowing where to 
reach your contacts. Whether they take your call is another question, though.
Think about all the personal or professional information that you commonly col-
lect on your best contacts. For example, if Michael Jordan is your client, you may 
like to know that he loves golf and fine cigars and has five kids. And he’s always 
driven to be number one.

CHAPTER 9  Developing Contacts      143
Ask yourself these questions while you customize your contact record:
»
» What professional information is important in your business (for example, 
prior employers or associations)?
»
» What personal information can help you build a better relationship?
»
» How do you evaluate the strength of your relationship with the contact?
»
» What probing questions do you commonly ask all contacts? (For example, 
what are their current initiatives and business challenges?)
We always advise keeping it simple, but if any specific fields are missing, write 
them down and seek out your system administrator. (See Chapter 17 for the details 
on how to build fields and other design tricks.) Salesforce can help you remember 
important details about your contacts, and you can use that information to build 
better relationships.
Entering and Updating Your Contacts
Your contact database is only as good as the information it contains, so Salesforce 
has multiple ways for you to get your contacts into the system. You can either start 
from scratch and manually create new contact records, or if you already have con-
tacts on a spreadsheet or in another tool, you can use Salesforce’s simple wizard 
to import your contacts within minutes. In the following sections, we discuss 
quick and simple ways to get started and how to update records.
PRECISION TARGET MARKETING
A leading telecommunications provider wanted to improve the coordination between 
sales efforts and marketing programs. Over the course of a year, the provider’s market-
ing department planned numerous campaigns that included direct marketing, trade 
shows, customer case studies, client outings, and so on. In the past, marketing manag-
ers wasted substantial time trying to extract contact information from the sales teams. 
By customizing the contact record to collect important personal and business informa-
tion, and then training sales reps to update custom fields on contacts in Salesforce, the 
company has realized substantial savings in time and better productivity in targeted 
marketing programs.

144      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Entering new contacts
Because contacts belong to accounts, the best, most reliable way to create contact 
records is by starting from the relevant Account detail page. From the Account 
detail page, you can then add a contact by using either the Create New drop-down 
list on the sidebar or the New button on the Contacts related list. The result is the 
same in both situations, and Salesforce automatically prefills the Account lookup 
field. By doing this, you can always find your contact, and your contact’s activities 
also appear in a list on its Account detail page.
To create contacts by using this best practice, follow these steps:
1.	 Search for the account, and then click the appropriate Account Name 
link on the Search Results page.
The Account detail page appears.
2.	 Click the New button on the Contacts related list.
The Edit mode of a new contact appears, as shown in Figure 9-1.
3.	 Fill in the fields as much as you can or as required.
The Account field is prefilled with the account you were working from.
4.	 When you’re done, click one of the following buttons:
•	 Save: After you click the Save button, the Contact detail page appears. On 
this page, you can click the Edit button whenever you need to modify 
information on the record.
FIGURE 9-1:  
Completing fields 
on a contact 
record.

CHAPTER 9  Developing Contacts      145
•	 Save & New: Clicking this button saves the current contact record and 
automatically opens a new, blank contact record in Edit mode.
A link to the first contact appears in your Recent Items list in the left sidebar.
Importing your contacts and accounts
If you already have contact lists from another database (such as Excel), you can 
use the Data Import Wizard to create multiple contact records in Salesforce and be 
done in no time. The Data Import Wizard is located in the Tools sections of either 
the Accounts or Contacts home page.
When you import accounts, you can import just companies and their associated 
information, or you can import companies and their related contacts in one action. 
Which route you take really depends on your existing data and what you want in 
Salesforce.
To import your contacts and accounts automatically, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Contacts tab to go to the Contacts home page, and then click 
Import My Business Accounts & Business Contacts under the Tools section.
The Import Business Accounts & Business Contacts Wizard appears, which 
includes four steps for importing records, plus helpful hints.
If you’re a system administrator for Salesforce, you can click the Import My 
Organization’s Accounts & Contacts link, which allows you to import substan-
tially more records at one time with different owners. If you’re an administra-
tor, that link also appears under the Tools sections of the Accounts or Contacts 
home pages. What’s the big deal? Most users can import 500 records at a time, 
but if you’re a system administrator, you can import 50,000 at a time and leap 
over tall buildings in a single bound.
2.	 In your existing contact tool or file, compare your current fields with the 
fields in Salesforce. Add fields to the account or contact records by custom-
izing Salesforce.
If you can map all the information you currently have to fields in Salesforce, 
move on to Step 3. If you have to add fields to Salesforce to match fields, see 
Chapter 17.
3.	 Export your file.
You may have contacts and accounts in an existing database, such as Zoho 
CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Access, or Microsoft Outlook. Most 
systems like these have simple tools for exporting data into various formats. 
Select the records and the fields that you want to export. Then export the file 
and save it in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. If your accounts are 

146      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
already in spreadsheet format, such as Microsoft Excel, just resave the file in 
the CSV format.
4.	 Review and prepare your data in Excel.
Refine your accounts and contacts before bringing them into Salesforce or 
clean them up after the import — it’s up to you. Some sales reps prefer to 
make changes on a spreadsheet first because they’re more accustomed to 
spreadsheets.
When preparing your import file, keep these points in mind:
•	 Enter your column headers in the first row. We recommend renaming 
column headers to be consistent with the field names in Salesforce. For 
example, you could rename the Company field from Outlook as Account 
Name.
•	 To import data for your entire company (available as an option only to 
system administrators), add a column for Record Owner to signify who 
should own the record in Salesforce. Otherwise, as the person importing, 
you own all the records from the file.
•	 To differentiate locations of a company (for example, Sony in Tokyo versus 
Sony in New York), add a column for Account Site and update the rows in 
your file to reflect the different sites.
•	 Link accounts in the import file by adding columns for Parent Account and 
Parent Site and by filling in fields as necessary to reflect the hierarchy.
•	 Make sure that a Type column exists and that fields are filled to corre-
spond to the types of companies you track (customers, partners, pros-
pects, competitors, and so on).
•	 For files with more than 500 rows, divide the master file into smaller files to 
fit the Import Wizard’s size limitation. You have to repeat the Import Wizard 
for each of the smaller files.
•	 To import contacts and accounts at the same time, add a column for the 
billing address fields if those addresses are different from the contacts’ 
mailing addresses.
For more hints on importing, click the Help and Training link and check out the 
Training and Support information in Salesforce by searching for the keyword 
Importing.
When you’re figuring out how to import data into Salesforce, we recommend 
testing an import with five or so records first, just to make sure that you know 
what you’re doing. After importing the test data, review your new records to 
make sure that they contain all the information you want to have brought in. 
Delete the test records, refine your import file, if necessary, and then run 
through the final import.

CHAPTER 9  Developing Contacts      147
5.	 After preparing the file, and clicking the Import My Organization’s Accounts & 
Contacts link, click Launch Wizard.
The Data Import appears in a new window.
6.	 Choose Accounts and Contacts under the Standard objects tab in the left 
window and choose what you want to do with them.
You can add new records, update existing Salesforce records, or update and 
add new ones at the same time.
7.	 Click Add New Records and choose the unique identifier for the records.
If you want Salesforce to avoid importing duplicate records, choose whether 
you want a duplicate contact to be identified by matching name or email. If a 
contact record with the matching criteria already exists in Salesforce, 
Salesforce updates that record with the information in your file.
8.	 Drag and drop your CSV file into the right window, as shown in Figure 9-2, 
and click Next when you’re done.
The Edit Field Mapping page appears, where you can edit your data mapping.
9.	 Map the contact fields between your file and Salesforce, and when you’re 
done, click Next.
If you’re importing only accounts, skip this step. Otherwise, just go through the 
field mapping, click the Change link to modify the auto-mapped fields, and click 
the Map link to map your unmapped fields to Salesforce, as shown in Figure 9-3.

Mapping fields is simply the process by which you associate a field from one 
database with a field in another database so that your data appears in the right 
fields. For example, if you’re importing your contacts from Outlook, you want 
data from the field called Company in Outlook to map to the field called 
Account Name in Salesforce. Take your time when making the mappings. Pay 
attention to which screens are for account-specific fields and which screens are 
for contact-specific fields.
10.	Review your selections and import to make sure you didn’t forget anything, 
and when you’re ready click Start Import.
This step basically warns you about problems with the data or lets you know 
about fields that haven’t been mapped. If you discover an error, you can click 
the Previous button and refine your mapping, or even close the wizard so that 
you can improve your import file. You might have to start over, but at least you 
avoid importing bad or incomplete data.
When you click Start Import, an Importing page appears to confirm that your 
import is in progress.
11.	Click OK and later check the records that you imported.
Salesforce sends you an email after it successfully imports your file. To check 
your import, click the Contacts tab to go to your Contacts home page. Use the 
Recent Contacts section drop-down list to select the Recently Created option, 
and a list of the contacts that were recently created appears. Click the link 
for a contact that you just imported to double-check that the information is 
accurate.
FIGURE 9-3:  
Mapping contact 
fields.

CHAPTER 9  Developing Contacts      149
If you’re importing both accounts and contacts, scroll down on an applicable 
account to verify that all the right contacts are linked from your import file. Click 
into a specific account and contact record and check to see that the information 
matches your import file.
Researching contacts on social networks
Visiting a company’s website may tell you about its location and phone number, 
but it won’t help you figure out which sports team to mention when calling a cus-
tomer. For detailed insight on a person’s likes and dislikes, you have to turn to 
social networks. We all do it. Before dialing that prospect’s phone number, we 
look up the person online to see a picture and find out more about him or her. 
Sure, it’s a little creepy, but it definitely helps you avoid saying the wrong thing.
With Social Contacts, Salesforce lets you link to your existing social network 
accounts and then search and select the right profiles for your contacts from right 
inside Salesforce. The best part is, from then on, every time you visit that contact, 
his picture will appear in the upper-left corner of the page with links to his social 
network profiles.
Updating contact fields
While you work with your contacts, you may need to modify contact information. 
To update a contact, follow these steps:
1.	 Type the name of your contact in the Global Search field at the top of any 
Salesforce page and click Search.
A Search Results page appears.
2.	 Click the desired Contact Name link.
The Contact detail page appears.
3.	 As with any record, double-click any field that has a pencil icon to its right to 
edit that field.
If a field doesn’t have an icon at the right of the field, click the Edit button at the 
top of the record to make changes. A padlock icon means that you can’t edit 
that field.
4.	 Update the fields as necessary and then click Save.
The Contact detail page reappears.

150      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Cloning an existing contact
If you want to add a contact that’s similar to an existing record, cloning can save 
you keystrokes and time. To clone a contact, go to the existing contact and follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click the Clone button at the top or bottom of the contact record.
A new contact record in Edit mode appears. All the information is identical to 
the previous record.
2.	 Edit the information on the new contact record, where appropriate.
Pay attention to what’s prefilled because you want to avoid inaccurate 
information on the new contact record.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
You created a new contact without altering your existing contact.
Organizing Your Contacts
When you have all or a portion of your contacts entered in Salesforce, you can 
begin to organize them to suit the way you sell.
In the following sections, we show you how you can use list views and other tools 
from the Contacts home page to provide greater focus for you and your sales teams. 
We also show you an important feature of the contact record that lets you build 
powerful organizational charts (also called org charts) for contacts of an account. 
(See Chapter 17 to find out how to use standard and custom contact reports.)
Using contact list views
A contact list view is a list of contacts that match certain criteria. When you select a 
list view, you’re specifying criteria to limit the results that you get back. The 
advantage of using a list view versus searching is that you can use the list view 
over and over again. For example, if you like to send a card on a contact’s birthday, 
you can benefit from a preset list view for this month’s birthdays.
The Contacts home page comes with several predefined list views, including
»
» All Contacts: Provides a list of all the contact records entered into Salesforce. 
Depending on the way your company has set up your security model, you 
may not see this view or its results.

CHAPTER 9  Developing Contacts      151
»
» Birthdays This Month: Generates a list of contacts whose birthdays land in 
the current month (assuming that you collect that information).
»
» New This Week: Generates a list of contacts that have been created since the 
beginning of the week.
»
» Recently Viewed Contacts: Allows you to look at a list of contacts that you’ve 
recently viewed.
You use a predefined contact list view in exactly the same way that you use any list 
view (detailed in Chapter 17) or the predefined list view for any other record.
Creating custom contact views
If you want special lists for the way that you track your contacts, we recommend 
building custom list views, just as you do for any other record. (For an example of 
how to create a custom view, see Chapter 17.) For example, if you sell medical 
equipment, and once per month you like to call your contacts who are dentists, 
you can create a list view to simplify your work.
Developing Organizational Charts
Having 20 contacts associated with an account is great, but you may not be any 
further along in understanding the pecking order. In practice, sales reps have 
been building org charts to strategize on accounts ever since someone thought up 
org charts, but often, the charts resided on whiteboards and PowerPoint presenta-
tions. (And whiteboards are tough to lug around.) By using the org chart feature 
in Salesforce, you can quickly define the reporting structure for your contacts and 
use that structure to more easily identify your relationships with your 
customers.
To build an org chart in Salesforce, follow these steps:
1.	 Add all the contacts for an account.
See the section “Entering and Updating Your Contacts,” earlier in this chapter, 
for details about adding records.
2.	 Go to the contact record for a person who’s low on the totem pole and then 
click the Edit button.
The record appears in Edit mode.

152      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
3.	 Type the name of the contact’s boss in the Reports To field and then click the 
Lookup icon to the right of the field (it looks like a little magnifying glass).
A pop-up window that contains search results appears.
4.	 Select the correct contact or refine your search until you can select the right 
contact.
The pop-up window disappears, and the Reports To field is prefilled with the 
selected contact, as shown in Figure 9-4.
5.	 Click Save.
The Contact detail page appears.
6.	 Click the View Org Chart link that appears to the right of the Reports To field 
on the contact record to display the hierarchy.
An Org Chart list page appears, and like other lists, you can click a link to go to 
a specific contact.
Some sales reps run into certain challenges based on the way they create the org 
charts in Salesforce. One such challenge is gaps; you just may not know or even 
care about the entire reporting structure. By getting creative and building place-
holder contacts, you can avoid pitfalls. For example, if you sell to both the busi-
ness side and the technology side of a customer, create a contact record called “IT 
Organization” and another called “Business Organization” and then align your 
contacts accordingly. This technique also works well for orphans, where you know 
one contact in a department and don’t want to leave the contact out of the org 
chart for the entire account.

our sales pipeline is the lifeblood of your business. It’s the list of deals that 
can help you achieve your sales targets. But try as you might, you can prob-
ably never close every deal in your pipeline. Things happen: Budgets get 
slashed, projects get tabled, you lose to a competitor, decision makers change. So, 
you need enough deals to give yourself the chance to hit and exceed your revenue 
goals in a given time frame.
An opportunity in Salesforce is a sales deal that you want to track to an ultimate 
conclusion (ideally, a win). The opportunity record has tools to help you effi-
ciently track and close a sale. By using Salesforce, you can manage more opportu-
nities at the same time and pursue each opportunity with greater precision. For 
example, if you’re a Salesforce sales rep, you can use opportunities to follow a 
standard process, link distribution partners, associate products, strategize against 
competition, record your actions and other notes, and more. And you don’t have 
to waste precious time updating a pipeline spreadsheet. Instead, you or your man-
ager can generate the current pipeline with the click of a button.
In this chapter, we show you the techniques and best practices for using opportu-
nities to track sales. First, you find out the most reliable way to create opportuni-
ties. Then we discuss how to view them in the manner that makes sense to you. 
You can also discover how to update your records so that your information is cur-
rent and how to use Chatter to follow opportunities.
Chapter 10

154      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Getting Familiar with the  
Opportunity Record
An opportunity record is the collection of fields that make up the information on a 
deal you’re tracking. The record has only two modes: In Edit mode, you modify 
fields; in View mode, you view the fields and the opportunity’s related lists.
An opportunity record comes preconfigured with several standard fields. Most of 
these fields are self-explanatory, but be sure to pay attention to these critical ones:
»
» Amount: This field displays the intended, best-guess amount of the sale. 
Depending on the way your company calculates the pipeline report, you might 
use numbers that include total contract value, the bookings amount, 
and so on.
»
» Close Date: Use this required field for your best guess as to when you’ll close 
this deal. Depending on your company’s sales process, the close date has 
different definitions, but this field is commonly used to track the date that you 
signed all the paperwork required to book the sale.
»
» Expected Revenue: This read-only field is automatically generated by 
multiplying the Amount field by the Probability field.
»
» Forecast Category: This field is typically hidden, but every opportunity 
automatically includes a value. Each sales stage within the Stage drop-down list 
corresponds to a default forecast category so that higher-probability opportu-
nities contribute to your overall forecast after they reach certain stages.
»
» Opportunity Owner: This person in your organization owns the opportunity. 
Although an opportunity record has only one owner, many users can still 
collaborate on an opportunity.
»
» Opportunity Name: This required text field represents the name of the 
specific deal as you want it to appear on your list of opportunities or on a 
pipeline report.
When naming opportunities, you and your company should define a standard 
naming convention for the Opportunity Name field so that you can easily 
search for and distinguish opportunities from a list. We recommend that the 
opportunity name start with the account name, then a hyphen, and then the 
name of the customer’s project or the product of primary interest. This 
naming convention makes for readable reports later on.
»
» Private: If you want to keep an opportunity private, select this check box to 
render the record accessible to only you, your bosses, and the system 
administrator.

CHAPTER 10  Tracking Opportunities      155
»
» Probability: The probability is the confidence factor associated with the 
likelihood that you’ll win the opportunity. Each sales stage that your company 
defines is associated with a default probability to close. Typically, you don’t 
need to edit this field; it gets assigned automatically by the Stage option that 
you pick. In fact, your administrator might remove write access from this field 
altogether.
»
» Stage: This required field allows you to track your opportunities, following 
your company’s established sales process. Salesforce provides a set of 
standard drop-down list values common to solution selling, but your system 
administrator can modify these values.
»
» Type: Use this drop-down list to differentiate the types of opportunities that 
you want to track. Most customers use the Type drop-down list to measure 
new versus existing business and products versus services, but your system 
administrator can modify it to measure other important or more specific deal 
types, such as add-ons, upsells, work orders, and so on.
When customizing your opportunity fields, take into consideration the patience 
and attention spans of your end-users. Keep the record as simple as possible to 
ensure that all your important fields actually get filled in. If you add many fields, 
you might make the opportunity record harder to use, which then puts user adop-
tion of Salesforce at risk. At the same time, you’ll have greater success with 
opportunities when you can easily capture what you want to track.
Entering Opportunities
Before you can begin using Salesforce to close opportunities, first you must get 
the records into Salesforce. The best method for creating a new opportunity is to 
start from the relevant account or contact record, which guarantees that the 
opportunity associates to the correct record, making the opportunity easily track-
able. And if you add the opportunity from a contact, you link both the account and 
the contact at the same time.
To create an opportunity, go to the relevant Account or Contact detail page and 
follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Create Opportunity option from the Create New drop-down list 
on the sidebar.
Alternatively, scroll down the detail page to the Opportunities related list and 
click the New button. The result is the same. The Edit mode of a new opportu-
nity appears (see Figure 10-1). The Account Name field is conveniently filled in 
for you.

156      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
2.	 Fill in the fields as much as you can or as required.
At a minimum, you must complete the required fields. Depending on how you 
set up your opportunity record, you might have to fill in additional required 
fields, all of which are highlighted in red. See the section “Getting Familiar with 
the Opportunity Record,” earlier in this chapter, for more details on common 
required fields.
3.	 Click Save when you’re done.
The Opportunity detail page appears. You can click the Edit button on this page 
at any time if you need to modify the record.
If you have the good fortune to need to enter multiple opportunities, one after 
another, instead of clicking the Save button, click the Save & New button. 
A new opportunity record appears in Edit mode. You have to fill in the Account 
Name field, but this technique can save you time.
If your company has legacy databases that contain deal information and you want 
this data to be in Salesforce as opportunities, you can’t use an import wizard to 
migrate your records like you can with leads, accounts, and contacts. If this is a 
current challenge, seek out your technical staff, system administrator, Salesforce 
rep, or a Salesforce consultant. With business guidance, a person with the technical 
know-how can use the Apex Data Loader to import opportunities and other records 
into Salesforce, which can help you avoid wasting time manually re-inputting 
opportunities. See Chapter 22 for additional tips and tricks on migrating data.

CHAPTER 10  Tracking Opportunities      157
Modifying Opportunity Records
After you add opportunities to Salesforce, you can make changes to your records 
when deals progress, stall, or fade away. In the following sections, we cover three 
common practices: editing, sharing, and reassigning.
Updating opportunity fields
In the course of working with your opportunities, you inevitably collect informa-
tion that you want to save directly in the opportunity record. Every time you cap-
ture important data on your opportunity, remember to update your record by 
following these steps:
1.	 Click the Edit button on the opportunity.
You can also hover your mouse over the specific field that you want to edit. If a 
pencil icon appears to the right of the field, double-click the field to edit it. (If 
you see a padlock icon instead, that means the field is not editable, on purpose. 
Move along and pick another field to update.)
Alternatively, if you’re already in an account or contact record that’s linked to the 
opportunity, scroll down to the Opportunities related list and click the Edit link 
to the left of the desired opportunity. The result is the same. The Opportunity 
Edit page appears.
2.	 Update the fields, as necessary, paying particular attention to keeping fields 
such as Amount, Close Date, and Stage up to date.
Nine out of ten times, those fields play key roles in your company’s sales 
pipeline reports. By keeping your information up to date, you and other users 
can get a true measure of the opportunity’s progress.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The opportunity reappears in Saved mode. The fields that you edited are 
changed.
You can keep track of certain critical updates to your opportunity record by 
using the Stage History related list. Anytime you or one of your team members 
who has read-write access to your record modifies the Stage, Probability, Close 
Date, or Amount field, you can quickly scan this at the bottom of the opportunity­ 
record page to see who modified the record and when. See Chapter 17 for 
more detail on creating, updating, and cloning records, and Chapter 23 for 
more information about using and customizing reports.

158      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Rolling up opportunity data  
onto the ­account record
The opportunity record carries a great deal of quantifiable information about an 
account, such as how many licenses were sold, the amount of a deal, and so on. By 
collecting and aggregating key opportunity field information onto an account 
record, a sales rep can quickly see how valuable a particular customer is by view-
ing the total number of licenses a customer currently has, how much total revenue 
a customer has closed with your company, and the highest deal closed with that 
customer, to name a few examples.
You can aggregate this summary information in two ways:
»
» You can run a report that summarizes this information for you. (See 
Chapter 23 for more details on creating reports.)
»
» Your Salesforce administrator can choose which opportunity fields you want 
to have summarized automatically on the account record.
To create a custom roll-up of your opportunity data onto the account record, 
choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ Accounts ➪ Fields and then follow these steps:
1.	 In the Account Custom Fields and Relationships section, click the 
New button.
The New Custom Field Wizard opens.
2.	 Select the Roll-Up Summary radio button and click Next.
3.	 Enter the name of what you’re summarizing in the Field Label field and 
click Next.
The Field Name field automatically populates itself based on what you enter in 
the Field Label. In this example, we typed Total Deals Closed, hit the Tab key 
to populate the Field Name, and then clicked the Next button.
4.	 At the Define the Summary Calculation step, from the Summarized Object 
picklist, select Opportunities.
Identifying the summarized object tells Salesforce which records from which 
objects you want to be combined and summarized onto the account record.
5.	 Select the roll-up type from the selection of radio buttons in the Select 
Roll-Up Type section in the middle of the page, and then click Next.
This selection tells Salesforce how you want the field of your choice to be 
summarized. You can choose a count of records, the sum, the minimum value, 
or the maximum value. If you choose any of the latter three options, you also 

CHAPTER 10  Tracking Opportunities      159
have to identify which field in the opportunity you want to be summarized by 
using the Field to Aggregate picklist to make their choice.
You can filter out certain criteria in your result set.
If you want to summarize only records that meet certain criteria, select the 
Only Records Meeting Certain Criteria Should Be Included in the Calculation 
radio button to reveal a set of filter criteria. For example, you may want a sum 
of all the Amount fields for opportunities in which the Closed status equals 
True. (Figure 10-2 shows an example of defining the field calculation.)
6.	 Select which profiles should be able to view the new field and click Next.
7.	 Select on which page layout(s) the field should be displayed and click Save.
Organizing Your Opportunities
When you have all or a portion of your opportunities entered in Salesforce, you can 
begin to organize them to suit the way that you sell.
In the following sections, you find out how you can use views and other tools from 
the Opportunities home page to provide greater focus for you and your sales 
teams. Then, for even more robust organization of your opportunity information, 
check out Chapter 23 for specifics on how to use standard and custom opportunity 
reports.
FIGURE 10-2:

calculation.

160      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Defining contact roles
Depending on your sales process, at some early point, you need to identify the 
decision makers who’ll influence the buying decision. Contacts and their titles 
often don’t tell the whole story about decision makers, influencers, and the chain 
of command within an opportunity.
To better define the buying influences on an opportunity, go to an opportunity 
record and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New button on the Contact Roles related list.
The Contact Roles page appears for that specific opportunity, displaying a list 
of the available contacts linked to the related account (see Figure 10-3).
2.	 For each relevant contact, use the Role drop-down list to select the 
­appropriate role.
Salesforce comes preconfigured with a standard list of contact roles, but your 
company can customize this drop-down list if you need to modify the list of 
values. You don’t have to classify a role for every contact on the list; you can 
just leave the Role default value of None.
If the right role for your contact doesn’t appear, advise your system administra-
tor to customize the Opportunity Contract Role Picklist Values.
3.	 Select a radio button to designate the primary contact.
The primary contact typically refers to the person who’s currently your point of 
contact. One of the benefits of selecting a primary contact is that you can list 
who the primary contact is on a basic opportunity report.
FIGURE 10-3:  
Selecting the 
contact role.

CHAPTER 10  Tracking Opportunities      161
4.	 (Optional) Click the Lookup icon to the right of empty fields in the Contact 
column to add other contacts who are critical to your opportunity.
If you work with multitier selling models or if you collaborate with business 
partners on your deals, use contact roles to add contacts who aren’t employ-
ees of an account. For example, if your customer’s legal gatekeeper works for 
an outside law firm, you can use the Contact Roles related list to highlight the 
attorney’s role.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Opportunity detail page reappears, and your Contact Roles related list is 
updated to reflect contacts involved in the opportunity. If you need to add 
more contact roles, click the New button in the Contact Roles related list again.
Using opportunity teams
Depending on how you do business, you can identify opportunity teams so that all 
members working a deal can access the same record. An opportunity team is a set 
of users in your Salesforce instance that can collaborate on a single opportunity. 
You can also create default opportunity teams if, for example, you typically work 
on deals with the same account manager and presales representative from your 
territory.
To enable opportunity teams, choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ Opportunities ➪  
Opportunity Teams ➪ Opportunity Team Settings and click the Enable Team Sell-
ing check box, as shown in Figure 10-4.
Now you’ll see the page layout selection page, where you can select any and all 
opportunity layouts to which you can add the Opportunity Team related list.
FIGURE 10-4:

162      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Associating an opportunity team  
to your opportunity
Now that you have opportunity teams enabled for your organization, you can cre-
ate default opportunity teams or just create an ad hoc team and associate it with 
the opportunity you’re working on.
To create a default opportunity team that you typically work with, click your name 
in the upper right of any Salesforce page and choose My Settings. Then follow 
these steps:
1.	 In the My Settings menu on the left, select Advanced User Details.
The Advanced User Details page appears, with information about your profile.
2.	 Scroll down to Default Opportunity Team and click Add.
The Add Members page appears, where you can select the users you want to 
add to your default team, their level of access to the opportunity, and their 
team role, as shown in Figure 10-5.
You can choose to automatically add the default team to any opportunities you 
create or are reassigned to by selecting the corresponding check box on the 
Add Members page.
FIGURE 10-5:  
Adding members 
to your default 
opportunity

CHAPTER 10  Tracking Opportunities      163
3. Click Save when you’re done.
The Advanced User Details page reappears with your default opportunity team.
To associate your default team to an opportunity, navigate to the opportunity 
record you own, scroll down to the Opportunity Team related list, and click Add 
Default Team.
If you don’t have a default team, or just want to associate other users to the 
opportunity, click the Add button on the Opportunity Team related list, and select 
the users, roles, and level of access there.
Following Opportunities with Chatter
If you work as part of a sales team or just have a lot of deals to keep track of, 
Salesforce can bring you the news on your opportunities as it happens. You are 
automatically set to follow updates on any opportunity you create, but sometimes, 
you don’t want to hunt down what’s happening on someone else’s opportunity.
You can follow an Opportunity record by following these steps:
1.
From the Opportunity home page, click a recently viewed opportunity.
The Opportunity detail page appears, displaying the Chatter feed front and 
center, as shown in Figure 10-6.
For more information on how to use Chatter, see Chapter 6.
FIGURE 10-6:  
Following an 
opportunity.

164      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
2.	 To follow the discussion on this opportunity, click the Follow link with the 
green circled plus sign.
The Opportunity page updates to show a thumbnail photo of your profile 
picture under the Followers section, alongside photos of other people 
following this record. The Follow button now appears as a Following status, 
with a gray “X” next to it that you click if you want to unfollow the record.
Now when there’s Chatter activity on this opportunity, it appears in your 
Chatter feed displayed on your home page, too.

Tracking Products 
and Price Books
A
product, as its name implies, is a product or service that you sell to custom-
ers. Products are the individual line items that make up an opportunity. 
Depending on your goals for Salesforce, you may not need to immediately 
incorporate Salesforce’s product-type features into your opportunities. But if you 
sell multiple products and services and you struggle with product-level visibility, 
Salesforce provides powerful and easy tools to implement solutions for users of 
Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited Edition.
Using products in Salesforce benefits sales reps and people in product marketing, 
management, and development throughout your organization. Sales reps can 
quickly locate the price of a product and select products to calculate an opportu-
nity’s amount. Marketing, management, or development professionals can get 
vital sales information to support strategic business planning, new product devel-
opment, and product life cycle management.
In this chapter, we show sales teams how to use products and price books with 
opportunities (if your administrator has already set that up). Before setting up 
products and price books, though, administrators first need to do some advanced 
planning. We discuss how to create a product catalog, set up schedules, and build 
Chapter 11

166      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
price books. We then show you how to maintain products and price books on an 
ongoing basis to facilitate your sales goals. We conclude this chapter by showing 
you how to generate quotes that incorporate items from your product catalog so 
that you can email them to your contacts.
Discovering Products and Price Books
You need to know two key and interrelated terms before you can begin planning 
your product strategy in Salesforce:
»
» Products: Individual items that you sell through your opportunities. All 
products belong to one universal product catalog. After you create a product, 
though, you can associate it with one or multiple price books with identical or 
different prices. For example, you may use multiple price books if you use one 
set of prices when selling to qualified nonprofit agencies and a different set of 
prices when selling to companies in the private sector.
A product can have an associated schedule based on quantity, revenue, or 
both. If you sell products and break out schedules to forecast revenue recog-
nition or for planning, you can use Salesforce to reflect important schedules 
for products linked to opportunities.
To access the Products home page, click the Products tab. If you can’t see that, 
confirm that the Force.com drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the 
screen is set to Sales (versus something like Call Center). If you still don’t see it, 
check with your system administrator.
»
» Price book: A collection of products and their associated prices. A product 
with its associated price is a price book entry. You can also create custom price 
books based on your unique sales model.
You can associate a price book, add products, and build schedules on an 
opportunity through the Products related list on an Opportunity detail page.
Defining standard product fields
A product record consists of a number of fields that you use to capture information 
about a product you sell. If you’re involved in shaping products for your company, 
most of the standard fields are obvious. If you want specific definitions, click the 
Help link in the upper-right corner of Salesforce.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      167
Here are some important pointers on understanding the standard product record 
fields:
»
» Product Name: The name of your product. Make sure to use titles that are 
clear and familiar to your sales reps and customers.
»
» Product Code: An internal code or product ID used to identify your product. If 
your existing products and product codes reside in a financial database and 
you want to plan for integration, make sure that the product codes are 
consistent.
»
» Product Description: Text to distinguish products from each other. If you’re 
in product management or marketing, describe your products so that they’re 
obvious and useful for your sales teams.
»
» Product Family: The category of the product. Use this drop-down list when 
building reports that reflect sales data by product category. For example, if 
you work for a technology value-added reseller (VAR), you may want to reflect 
your pipeline by families that include hardware, software, services, training, 
and maintenance. You can set up products in Salesforce so that each product 
automatically maps to a product family.
»
» Active: This check box must be selected to make the product available to your 
users.
»
» Quantity Scheduling Enabled: Select this check box to enable quantity 
scheduling for a product. If you don’t see this check box, your administrator 
hasn’t enabled it.
»
» Revenue Scheduling Enabled: Select this check box to enable revenue 
scheduling for a product. If you don’t see this check box, your administrator 
hasn’t enabled it.
Understanding the different  
types of pricing
Salesforce allows you to customize your pricing based on the way you sell. If you 
use products in Salesforce, your company has three different options for pricing:
»
» Standard Prices: Default prices that you establish for your products when 
you set up your standard price book.
»
» List Prices: Prices that you set up for custom price books.
»
» Sales Price: Price of a product determined by the sales rep when he adds a 
product to an opportunity. (See the following section for details on adding 
products to opportunities.)

168      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
You’ll hear the terms products and opportunity products referenced when you start 
using Salesforce products and price books. What’s the difference? Products are the 
base level things that your company sells. Products can be assigned to various 
price books and given different list prices within those price books. Opportunity 
products are the specific products (and prices) that are associated with a specific 
opportunity. Opportunity products should reflect the negotiated price and condi-
tions for that specific opportunity.
Using Products and Price Books
Sales reps can add products with specific prices to their opportunities, and Sales-
force automatically calculates the Amount field on an opportunity record. If you’re 
a sales rep selling multiple products and managing multiple opportunities at the 
same time, you can take the frustration out of remembering what you offered to a 
customer. If you’re a sales manager, you can segment your pipelines and forecasts 
by product lines. And if you’re in product management or marketing, products in 
Salesforce can give you real insight into product demand from your markets.
Adding products to opportunities
To take advantage of products, your company must first set up a product catalog, 
as well as one or more price books. See the section “Building the Product Catalog,” 
later in this chapter, for the how-to details on setting up your products and price 
books. After this is done, sales reps can add products to an opportunity by going 
to a specific opportunity and following these steps:
1.	 Scroll down the Opportunity detail page to the Products related list and 
then click the Choose Price Book button.
A Choose Price Book page appears. If your company has made only one price 
book available to you, you can bypass this step and start with Step 2.
2.	 Select the appropriate price book from the Price Book drop-down list and 
then click Save.
The Opportunity detail page appears again. The Products related list now 
shows the name of the price book in parentheses.
On an opportunity, you can use only one price book at a time.
3.	 Click the Add Product button on the Products related list.
A Product Selection page appears, as shown in Figure 11-1. This shows all the 
products in your selected price book.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      169
If the resulting list of products is too long for your tastes, you may narrow the 
results by entering a keyword or filter criteria, and then clicking the Search 
button to begin your search. The page reappears with your search results in a 
table at the bottom of the page.
4.	 Select the check boxes next to the products that you want, and then click the 
Select button.
An Add Products page appears with your selections and fields for you to 
provide line item details. The Sales Price field is prefilled with the default sales 
price from the price book that you selected.
5.	 Fill in the line item details.
You must, at a minimum, fill in the Quantity and Sales Price fields for each 
selected product. The Date field is typically used to reflect an expected 
shipping or delivery date for the product. It could also be used to determine 
the contracted start date of a service.
6.	 When you’re done, click the Save button or the Save & More button.
Clicking the Save & More button takes you back to the Product Selection page. 
If you click the Save button, the Opportunity detail page reappears. Notice that 
the Amount and Quantity fields on the opportunity record have changed 
based on the total from the products you added.
If you need to change the details on your product selections in the course of the 
sales cycle, you can do this easily on the Products related list of the opportunity 
record.
FIGURE 11-1:  
Finding your 
products.

170      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
If you find yourself unable to modify the sales price on your products, you may 
want to politely confirm the intent with your sales manager. Some companies lock 
in the sales price for sales reps so that they must adhere to a predefined discount 
approval policy.
Adding and updating schedules  
on opportunities
If you manage opportunities in which your products or services are delivered over 
time, you can create schedules for your products by quantity, revenue, or both. By 
using schedules, you and your users can benefit in multiple ways:
»
» If you’re on a sales team: You get a better gauge on revenue recognition, 
which could be significant if that affects compensation.
»
» If you’re in product management: You can better forecast and plan for the 
number of units that you’ll have to deliver in future quarters.
»
» If you’re part of a services organization: Schedules updated by reps provide 
a real-time gauge in planning your resources and projects.
Your system administrator must first set up your products with scheduling. (See 
the section “Setting Up Schedules,” later in this chapter, for more specifics on 
schedules, and see Chapter 17 for the details on common Salesforce configuration 
actions.)
After scheduling is enabled for a product, set up a schedule by going to the Oppor-
tunity detail page and following these steps:
1.	 Click the desired product in the Product Name column of the Products 
related list.
An Opportunity Product page appears with a Schedule related list.
2.	 Click the Establish button in the Schedule related list.
An Establish Schedule page appears. If you see a Re-Establish button instead 
of an Establish button, you have an existing schedule already. Clicking 
Re-Establish deletes the old schedule and creates a new one by taking you 
to the Establish Schedule page.
3.	 Complete the fields and click Save.
Your fields may vary, depending on whether the product is set up for quantity, 
revenue, or combined scheduling. When you click Save, a schedule appears 
based on your choices.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      171
4.	 Review and modify the schedule.
If the revenues or quantities aren’t equal over the periods that you first 
established, you can type over the values in the schedule. For example, these 
amounts may not be equal if your customer has negotiated varying types of 
ramped payments, or more payments during certain times of the year to 
accommodate for heavier seasonal business.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Opportunity Product page reappears with the schedule you established.
Over the course of an opportunity, if terms change, you can adjust the schedule on 
a product by clicking the buttons on the Opportunity Product page. To access an 
Opportunity Product page, go to the relevant opportunity record, scroll down to 
the Products related list, and click the desired product link from the Product col-
umn. The Opportunity Product page for the selected product appears with a 
Schedule related list. You can do the following with the schedule:
»
» Modify the schedule. Click the Edit button.
»
» Delete the schedule. Click the Delete button.
»
» Establish the schedule all over again. Click the Re-Establish button.
Searching for products
You can search for specific products easily by using the Find Products search tool 
on the Products home page.
Instead of searching from the Products home page, you can search for products 
from your main home page. Your administrator must set this up for your com-
pany. For details on adding this home page tool, see Chapter 17 for customizing 
Salesforce and consult with your administrator.
To search for a product, go to the Products home page and follow these steps:
1.	 Enter keywords in the Find Products search tool and then click the Find 
Product button.
A Product Search page appears with a list of possible selections, as shown in 
Figure 11-2.
You can use the Find Products search tool to enter more keywords or filters to 
refine your search and again click the Find Product button. The list results 
change based on your criteria.

172      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
2.	 Click a link in the Product Name column to go directly to the product.
The Product detail page appears.
Building the Product Catalog
If you have a vested interest in your product strategy, be aware and take advantage 
of all the options that Salesforce provides for customizing products and price 
books. The more you plan ahead, the better you can implement products and price 
books for how your sales teams sell. As you make products and price books active, 
your sales reps can start associating products to their opportunities.
Planning products for success
For products, consider the characteristics of your products outside the standard 
realm that you want to analyze. In most companies, the product management or 
marketing teams own and maintain these records in coordination with finance. 
You should pull together a cross-functional team made up of sales, marketing, 
finance, and product management users to decide what you want to achieve from 
products in Salesforce. Then work with your system administrator to customize 
the product record to meet your specific needs. For more details on customization, 
see Chapter 17.
For pricing, consider whether to have set pricing on your products or whether you 
prefer to keep the pricing simple at the beginning. Some customers of Salesforce, 
for example, set the prices on their products at $0 or $1 and then depend on their 
sales reps to fill in the sales prices when they prepare an opportunity. Other com-
panies invest time and effort in creating actual standard or list prices on products 
to provide guidance to their sales reps.
FIGURE 11-2:  
Search for a 
­product.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      173
Adding products to the product catalog
Before your sales reps can begin linking products to their opportunities, you need 
to add the products to Salesforce.
To add a product, log in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Create Product option from the Create New drop-down list on 
the sidebar.
A New Product page appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
2.	 Complete the fields.
Your exact fields may vary, but see the section “Defining standard product 
fields,” earlier in this chapter, for info on the standard fields.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Product detail page for your new product appears with related lists for 
standard prices and price books.
Changing product details  
in the product catalog
Over time, marketing or product managers may need to update details about a 
product. You can make most of your changes to a product from its detail page. Go 
to a specific product and take a look at this list of actions that you can perform. 
FIGURE 11-3:  
Add a product to 
the product 
catalog.

174      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
(You must have “edit” permissions on products to perform these steps. See Chap-
ter 21 for details on granting the right permissions to the right people.)
»
» Edit the product record. Click the Edit button. For example, if the name of 
your product changes, you can change the product name and then save and 
automatically update all opportunities that include that product with the 
modified name.
»
» Delete the product. Click Delete and then click OK in the dialog box that 
appears. In circumstances in which you’re no longer offering a product but it’s 
linked to opportunities, it’s better that you deactivate or archive the product 
rather than delete it.
»
» Deactivate the product. Click the Edit button, deselect the Active check box, 
and then click Save. Take this path if you might offer the product in the future.
»
» Delete and archive the product. Click Delete and then click OK in the dialog 
box that appears. If your product is linked to opportunities, a Deletion 
Problems page appears with suggested options. Click the Archive link if you’re 
still intent on deleting the product but not altering the existing opportunities.
If you want to keep your sales reps informed of any changes to your products (for 
example, if a product is no longer offered or if its name changed), you can use 
Salesforce Chatter so that any changes to a product’s status or its name are 
reported in a Chatter feed. Interested users need to just follow the actions of the 
person who makes those changes (usually someone in Sales Operations), or they 
can follow the specific product, too. (See Chapter 6 for more information on set-
ting up Chatter and its feeds and following users and records.)
Setting Up Schedules
If your company wants to track annuity streams, stay aware of key shipping dates, 
or estimate when revenue will be recognized on products, you can also set up 
schedules on all or some products.
Enabling schedules for your company
Your administrator first needs to enable schedules before you can add them on 
specific products.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      175
If your company wants to track shipping dates with Salesforce, you need to enable 
quantity scheduling. If your company wants to measure revenue recognition or 
anticipate upcoming payments, be sure to enable revenue scheduling. If your com-
pany wants to do both, you’d enable both types of scheduling.
To set up schedules, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ Products ➪ Product 
Schedules Settings.
The Schedule Setup page appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
2.	 Select the appropriate check boxes.
You can choose to enable schedules based on quantities, revenue, or both. 
You can also choose to enable schedules for all products.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Products page reappears.
Adding and updating a default schedule
After schedules have been enabled, you can create default schedules on existing 
products or while you’re adding new products.
By creating default schedules, you can simplify repetitive tasks for sales reps. 
With this setting, a default schedule is created when a sales rep adds a product to 
an opportunity. A sales rep can still reestablish a product schedule on an opportu-
nity. The product date determines the start date for the installments.
If you sell a basic service with different payment plans, consider creating a unique 
product for each payment plan and then using default revenue schedules. By doing 
this, you can simplify the data entry for the rep and reduce the chance of error.
FIGURE 11-4:  
Enable schedules 
for your 
company.

176      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
To create a default schedule, follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Create New Product option on the sidebar or click the Edit 
button on a product record.
A Product page appears in Edit mode. (Make sure you didn’t click Edit on an 
Opportunity Product record. Remember that an Opportunity Product record is 
different from a Product record.)
2.	 Complete the fields, as appropriate.
Here are some tips on completing the default schedule:
•	 Schedule Type: Select Divide if you want to divide the opportunity amount 
into installments. Select Repeat if you want to repeat the quantity or 
revenue on each installment.
•	 Installment Period: Define the frequency.
•	 Number of Installments: Define the duration.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Product detail page appears.
If your product has both quantity and revenue default scheduling, quantity sched-
uling is calculated first and drives the total amount. Then revenue scheduling 
divides the amount.
To update a default product schedule, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Products home page, search for the product whose schedule 
you’d like to update, using your preferred method.
See the “Searching for products” section, earlier in this chapter, for specifics. A 
Product Search page appears.
2.	 Click the product name of the specific product to edit.
The Product page appears.
3.	 Click the Edit button to update schedule information.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Product page for your product appears with the updated information.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      177
Managing Price Books
Some companies require just one universal price book. Many other companies, 
however, want custom price books based on their unique selling needs. Examples 
include price books that are based on the following:
»
» Geography: For a global company, the Japanese sales team might sell a 
subset of the products sold by its North American counterpart (and at 
different prices and in different currencies).
»
» Partner tiers: In some companies that sell via partners, strategic partners 
might get preferential pricing.
»
» Sales teams: If your company is divided into sales teams that sell different 
products, you can use custom price books to simplify the product selection for 
groups.
»
» Volume discounts: Some companies build price books based on volume 
purchases.
»
» Seasonality: Some companies change their pricing based on seasonal buying 
patterns. You can use custom price books to communicate pricing changes to 
your sales reps during these periods.
If the standard price book meets your objectives, keep it simple. Otherwise, in the 
following sections, we show you how to set up your price books.
Adding to the standard price book
Every time you add a standard price to a product, you automatically associate it 
with the standard price book. You can do this while you’re creating products, or 
you can add the standard prices after you’ve built the product records.
Adding standard prices while creating products
The easiest time to add a standard price is while you’re creating products. To use 
this method, start creating a product record as you normally would (see the sec-
tion “Building the Product Catalog,” earlier in this chapter). Instead of clicking 
Save, though, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Save & Add Price button (refer to Figure 11-3).
An Add Standard Price page appears, as shown in Figure 11-5.

178      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
2.	 Complete the Standard Price field and click Save.
The Product detail page appears, and a standard price displays on the 
Standard Price related list.
Adding or editing standard prices  
for existing products
You can also create the products first and add prices later. To add or edit a stan-
dard price, go to the desired Product detail page and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Add button on the Standard Price related list.
If standard prices already exist, you can click Edit or Edit All. The result is the 
same: An Add or Edit Standard Price page appears.
2.	 Complete or modify the Standard Price field, as necessary, and then click 
Save.
The Product detail page reappears with any changes reflected on the Standard 
Price related list.
Creating a custom price book
To create a price book, you need to be an administrator or have permission to 
manage price books.
To create a price book from scratch, go to the Products home page and follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click the Manage Price Books link under the Maintenance section, near 
the bottom of the page.
A Price Book page appears with a related list for recent price books.
2.	 Click the New button on the Recent Price Books related list.
A New Price Book page appears in Edit mode.
FIGURE 11-5:  
Add a standard 
price.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      179
3.	 Complete the fields.
Select the Active check box if you want to make the price book available.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Price Book detail page for your new price book appears with a Products 
related list.
Adding products to a custom price book
After the price book has been established, you can add products to it. A product 
listed on a price book is also referred to as a price book entry. To add products to an 
existing price book, go to a price book and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Add button on the Products related list.
A Product Selection page appears with a search tool and a list of products.
2.	 Enter keywords and filter criteria, and then click the Search button to 
narrow your search.
The Product Selection page reappears with a list of products based on your 
search criteria.
3.	 Use the check boxes on the search results to choose products and then click 
the Select button.
An Add List Price page appears.
4.	 Complete the fields.
Select the check boxes in the Use Standard Price column if you want to use the 
standard price for the list price of a product or just enter a list price. You can 
select the Active check boxes to make products immediately available in the 
price book.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save (or Save & More if you want to find more 
products).
After you save the product, the Price Book detail page reappears, and your 
selected products have been added to the Products related list.
Making global changes to price books
Maintaining accurate and up-to-date product and price lists is challenging, espe-
cially if you have an extensive product catalog and/or complex pricing. If you’re 
responsible for such a daunting task, you can use tools that are located on the 
Products home page to save time.

180      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Changing activation on price books
At times, you’ll want to make a price book unavailable to sales reps. Maybe you 
had to raise prices on a family of products or you stopped selling a product line. 
You probably need to preserve the current price book because existing customers 
and some prospects are still being associated with those products and prices, but 
new customers will need to be tied to the new catalog. Rest assured that you can 
deactivate one or more price books almost instantly so that sales reps won’t be 
able to tie new opportunities to old information.
To deactivate a price book, go the Products home page and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Manage Price Books link under the Maintenance section.
The Price Book detail page appears.
2.	 Create a custom price books list view to meet your needs.
In this example, click the Create New View link to create a custom view that 
filters your price books by those that are active. Call it the Active Price Books 
view. To learn how to create a custom list view, see Chapter 17.
3.	 On the Active Price Books custom list, click the Deactivate link next to a price 
book that you want to make unavailable.
The custom list view reappears, and the selected price book is no longer visible 
in this list because it is no longer active.
To reactivate price books, you follow a similar process, the difference being that 
you click the Activate link adjacent to a price book listed in a custom price book list 
view based on Inactive Price Books.
Cloning price books
On occasion, you may want to create a price book that closely resembles an exist-
ing price book. Instead of starting from scratch, you can clone from an existing 
price book and then make changes, as necessary.
To clone a price book, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Manage Price Books link under the Maintenance section.
The Price Book page appears.
2.	 Click the New button on the Recent Price Books related list.
A New Price Book page appears.

CHAPTER 11  Tracking Products and Price Books      181
3.	 Use the Existing Price Books drop-down list to select a price book to clone.
4.	 Type a unique name in the Price Book Name field, and give it a description 
in the Description field.
5.	 Select the Active check box when you want the new price book to be 
available to others for use.
6.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The new Price Book page appears with a Products related list cloned from the 
existing price book.
If necessary, click Edit or Edit All on the Products related list to change the list 
prices, and click Add or Delete in the Products related list to add or delete price 
book entries.
Deleting price books
You can delete price books, but if the price book is associated with existing oppor-
tunities, beware. In those circumstances, we recommend the following actions:
»
» Deactivate (rather than delete) the price book so that the linkage between 
opportunities and products stays intact.
»
» Delete the associated opportunity records first, and then delete the price 
book.
»
» Archive the price book entries prior to deleting. Then, even if you delete the 
price book record, the products associated with opportunities are retained.
If you still want to delete a price book, follow these steps:
1.	 On the Products home page, click the Manage Price Books link under the 
Maintenance section.
The Price Book detail page appears with related lists for active and inactive 
price books.
2.	 Click the link for the desired price book.
The specific Price Book page appears.
3.	 Click Delete and then click OK in the dialog box that appears.
If you select a price book that isn’t associated with opportunities, you return to 
the Price Book detail page with the lists of price books. If a Deletion Problems 
page appears, follow the suggestions provided in the preceding bulleted list 
and on the Deletion Problems page.

Managing Your 
Partners
B
ecause Salesforce can get sales reps and managers onboard to track all their 
opportunities and sales-related activities, the big pipeline picture should be 
getting clearer for everyone. Partners — which might also be known in your 
business as third-party companies, value-added resellers (VARs), original equip-
ment manufacturers (OEMs), wholesalers, or distributors — can also be accu-
rately managed in Salesforce almost as if they were full-time dedicated company 
sales reps. It used to be difficult to create and maintain unique messages and 
branding for specific groups of partners. Not anymore.
Salesforce Communities extends the existing Salesforce product to partners (as 
well as employees and customers, optionally) and the leads and deals they bring 
in. Additionally, support managers and support reps within a company can more 
easily resolve issues for your partners.
A detailed discussion of Salesforce Communities could take up a whole book on its 
own. In fact, many of the details are covered in Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies, 
by Jon Paz and TJ Kelley (Wiley), so in this chapter, we provide a high-level over-
view of what life is like for partners and channel reps. Then we discuss how a chan-
nel team manages its partners with Salesforce. For partners asked by their vendors 
to use this application, we discuss how to access and navigate Salesforce from a 
community. Finally, we give channel managers and administrators some pointers 
on how to set up a partner-focused community and begin giving partners access.
Chapter 12

Understanding the Partner Life Cycle
Using an indirect sales force of partners to help sell your products allows you to 
quickly and cost-effectively expand your company’s reach into markets that you 
might otherwise not have the resources to tackle. Some industries that are more 
partner intensive include high-tech, insurance, and manufacturing. In this sec-
tion, we set the stage for two types of business users and describe how Communi-
ties can help.
Here are some helpful Partner terms:
»
» Vendor: The company that’s using Salesforce and for whom the channel 
managers work.
»
» Channel managers: The employees within your company who manage a set 
of partners.
»
» Channel conflict: What happens when your direct sales force and your 
indirect sales force find the same prospect to woo and start bickering about 
who’s entitled to that lead — a clear sign that your current system is 
ineffective.
»
» Deal registration: Minimizes channel conflict. These programs get your 
indirect sales channel registering deals with you (the vendor) to reduce the 
chances of other partners or the direct sales force competing for a deal.
»
» Communities: Customizable web portals hosted by Salesforce.com that allow 
users to access Salesforce. Your company can set up multiple communities for 
partners, in addition to employees or customers.
»
» Partner accounts: Account records that are used by channel managers to 
manage partner organizations, partner users, and partner activities.
»
» Partner users: Salesforce users with limited capabilities and visibility into 
your instance of Salesforce. They’re associated with a specific partner account 
and access Salesforce via a community.
Understanding a day in the life  
of a channel manager
Channel managers and their direct reports, channel reps, manage relationships 
with various types of partners and partners-in-waiting. The channel team does 
whatever it can to empower its indirect sales force with the right selling tools, 
sticks, and carrots, to make sure that the relationship is win-win.

CHAPTER 12  Managing Your Partners      185
With Partner Communities, channel managers now have access to Salesforce 
dashboards, leads, opportunities, accounts, and content records. Dashboards pro-
vide a graphical snapshot of the channel’s performance so that you can see how 
much revenue the channel is bringing in. Leads are potential business that come 
either from a partner or to your company and are automatically or manually reas-
signed to the best partner for the job. Opportunities are the deals sourced or nur-
tured by your partners. Accounts can be resellers, distributors, agents — any type 
of partners that your business tracks. Channel managers can also use content to 
publish copies of sales tools, price lists, or product information for partners.
In addition to these standard tabs, you can also track partner budgets and fund 
claims if you run joint marketing programs, create and promote rebate programs 
with your partners, and more. Your administrator needs to set this up, so make 
sure that she reads the section “Setting Up Salesforce Communities for Your 
Channel Team,” later in this chapter.
Understanding a day in the life of a partner
A partner’s perspective is the flip side of the relationship managed by the channel 
manager. For example, one type of partner could be reselling your company’s 
products. That partner works in a territory that’s managed by a channel manager.
With Salesforce Communities, partner users can now access a limited view of your 
Salesforce information via a Partner Community. The Partner Community pro-
vides a centralized view of leads to pursue, opportunities in your pipeline, vendor 
documents to help with the sales cycle, and optional tabs to help with additional 
responsibilities, such as making fund requests. Partners get to see leads specifi-
cally assigned to them or grabbed from a general “shark tank” in which first come 
is first served. Additionally, partners can receive other key targeted messages on 
the website, update their company’s information for the vendor to see, and email 
their channel rep, as needed. Figure 12-1 shows a sample Partner Community that 
you might set up for your partners.
MEASURING PARTNER PERFORMANCE
A major communication services company drove its channel sales strategy by partner-
ing with leading wireless equipment manufacturers. Sometimes, the company was 
introduced to the end customer; other times, the company was involved in opportuni-
ties completely managed by the manufacturer. But in all circumstances, the company’s 
channel managers leveraged Communities to track the partner sales performance, to 
improve mindshare with strategic partners, and to deepen its relationships with end 
customers.

Managing Your Channel with  
Salesforce Communities
After your administrator has set up your organization with Salesforce Communi-
ties, the channel team can easily access it from the Force.com app menu in the 
upper-right corner of your Salesforce window. This section provides a high-level 
overview of how the channel team can now use Salesforce Communities to gain 
better visibility into their partner relationships. We also recommend that you scan 
Chapters 3, 7, and 8, which talk in more detail about navigating Salesforce, as well 
as leads and accounts.
Enabling partner relationship management
To allow partners to take part in the benefits of communities while still providing 
certain privileges specific to partners (such as working leads assigned to them), 
you have to first turn it on.
To enable partner relationship management, follow these steps, but note: This 
action is not reversible! We suggest you try out this feature in a Developer Edition 
instance first, or your sandbox if you own Enterprise Edition or higher.
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize ➪ Partners ➪ Settings.
A page appears to enable partner relationship management (PRM).
2.	 Click the Edit button and select the only check box on this page to enable PRM.
You’re reminded that this action is not reversible.

CHAPTER 12  Managing Your Partners      187
3.	 Click the Save button.
The Convert External User Access Wizard appears. This wizard helps you adjust 
sharing settings that might allow certain records or folders to be otherwise 
shared with external users.
4.	 Click the Continue button.
The three-step wizard begins.
5.	 In Steps 1 through 3 of the wizard, see whether any existing sharing rules 
need to be updated.
Consider whether any records may contain information that you don’t want 
shared with partners.
6.	 Click Done when you’re finished, or click Cancel if you don’t have any 
rules to modify.
Creating partner accounts and contacts
First, you should make sure that all your partners are represented as accounts in 
Salesforce, with the respective channel managers owning the partner account 
records. This allows channel managers to monitor and record all activities related 
to partners in their territory.
To create a new partner account, follow these steps:
1.	 Use the Create New drop-down list on the sidebar and select the 
Account option.
2.	 Create the account record.
3.	 Click the Manage External Account button and select the Enable as Partner 
option from the resulting drop-down list.
4.	 Associate partner users to this partner account record by adding contacts.
5.	 Create a new contact, click the Manage External User button on the contact 
record, and select Enable Partner User for your partner user to receive his or 
her login and password notification via email.
A New User page appears, allowing you to confirm user details before saving 
the record and generating a password for the user.
Assigning leads to partners
By assigning leads to partners, channel managers ensure an organized way of 
seeing what potential business their partners are working on.

188      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
Leads may be assigned to partners by manually switching the record ownership, 
by assigning partner leads to a queue (also known lovingly as the “shark tank”), 
or by adopting a round-robin method, in which leads are routed evenly to a num-
ber of queues. Partners then have access to the queue to grab leads. (You can keep 
them from getting too greedy by setting a ceiling on how many leads they can 
accept to work on at one time.) Additionally, lead assignment rules may be set up 
by your administrator to automatically assign leads to partner users or partner 
queues based on certain rules.
To reassign a lead to a partner user, follow these steps:
1.	 On the lead record, next to the Lead Owner field, click the Change link.
The link is in square brackets. The Change Lead Owner page appears.
2.	 From the Owner drop-down list, choose the Partner User option.
3.	 Select the partner user to whom you are assigning the lead.
This assumes the partner’s profile has been added as a member to the 
community you want him to join, the community has been published and can 
be viewable by others, and the partner user is already activated and logged in 
at least once to the system. If the user is not active, his name will not show up 
when filtering for partner users.
4.	 (Optional) Select the Send Notification Email check box to notify the partner 
about the lead.
5.	 Click Save.
The lead record reappears with your ownership change. The new partner 
owner instantly receives a customizable email if you selected the Send 
Notification check box, and the lead appears in his Lead Inbox the next time he 
accesses the Partner Community.
You may also reassign leads in bulk (see Chapter 7).
Reducing channel conflict  
with deal ­registration
Without a well-thought-out PRM process, companies often run into channel con-
flict when their direct sales and indirect sales forces butt heads over who found 
which lead first. As the channel manager, you often have to waste time arguing 
with a direct sales rep and her manager over who has dibs, while the prospect 
waits for the internal bickering to stop. This isn’t an efficient way to close a deal, 
and it’s frustrating for the customer to often hear multiple messages (or even 
price quotes!) from what’s supposed to be a united front. In addition, if the 

CHAPTER 12  Managing Your Partners      189
partner loses out on that opportunity, you’ve just lost some of her trust in how 
supportive you really are in her efforts — so why should she reveal her pipeline 
data early or adopt your processes?
By taking the time to design a deal registration process, concisely and consistently 
communicate the status of deal registrations to partners, efficiently carry out the 
approval for all submissions, and then be able to measure related conversion and 
close ratios, you can eliminate channel conflict. The deal registration capabilities 
of Salesforce Communities help provide clarity on what your deal registration 
processes are from start to finish, which can increase adoption of your partner 
program and help increase partner sales because the channel conflict inefficien-
cies disappear. However, this setup can be successful only if you invest the time to 
think out your deal registration process. If you have a hard time explaining it or 
whiteboarding it, how do you think your partners feel?
Here are some key questions to ask before establishing any deal registration 
program:
»
» How would you describe your deal registration process, from start to finish?
»
» What do partners get for registered deals? Exclusivity? A rebate? A different 
tier or status?
»
» What do you think would increase deal registrations?
SALESFORCE TO SALESFORCE
Salesforce to Salesforce is an amazing alternative feature to Salesforce Communities 
that allows partners with their own instance of Salesforce to seamlessly share lead and 
opportunity records with vendors in real-time. Traditionally, this sharing occurred 
through a hairy, expensive, and drawn-out integration process. If a lot of your partners 
also use Salesforce, think about what partner processes you want to track.
If you have very specific custom processes that are more focused on a high volume of 
lead and opportunity management, you may lean toward using Salesforce to Salesforce.
If you send a lot of customized partner communications, including collateral and con-
tent distribution, and you deal with both a Salesforce-owning and non-Salesforce-­
owning indirect sales force, you may want to lean more toward the Partner Community.
We don’t have one correct answer to give you, so make sure that you run things by your 
customer success manager.

Accessing Salesforce Communities  
as a Partner
You can strengthen your vendor relationship by accessing your vendor’s instance 
of Salesforce from a web portal and getting first-hand access to leads, accounts, 
opportunities, and other tabs to manage your deals. You can get leads assigned to 
you in real-time — no waiting forever after a trade show ends to see which leads 
to pursue. You can also provide your channel managers with real-time updates on 
the status of deals that you’re trying to bring in. That way, if you need some assis-
tance, your channel manager can view all deal-related activity that occurred up to 
a certain point and provide you with the appropriate resources to close the deal. In 
the following sections, we give you a quick overview of accessing and navigating 
your Partner Community.
As a partner sales rep, you’ll receive an email from your vendor’s Salesforce admin-
istrator after he’s ready for you to start accessing the community. The email wel-
comes you to the community and provides you with everything you need to log in.
In this email, click the appropriate link to log in directly to your community and 
change your temporary password. Remember to bookmark the URL for easy access 
later. After logging in and changing your password, you’re brought to the home 
page for your Partner Community. Every time you log in to the Partner Commu-
nity, you begin at your home page. You’ll see that the Partner Community is orga-
nized into a series of tabs (refer to Figure  12-1). The look of your portal may 
resemble your vendor’s branding or your own.
Viewing and updating your leads
Similar to a direct sales user’s view, a partner will see a Leads tab, which contains 
leads that have been assigned to the partner directly or to a general queue. The 

CHAPTER 12  Managing Your Partners      191
queue allows channel managers to make leads available to their partners on a 
first-come-first-served basis while also avoiding multiple partners working on 
the same lead. After you claim a lead from the queue, no other partner can claim it.
Play nicely. The Force.com platform is very customizable, and your vendor could 
set up rules for how many leads each partner can claim so that a partner with an 
itchy trigger finger doesn’t take away all the goodies.
The leads available to you are viewable from the Lead Views list and are displayed 
according to columns set by your vendor. Click any column heading to re-sort 
your list according to that column’s criteria. Click the same column header a 
­second time to re-sort your list in reverse order.
If you see a record in your list, that’s a lead in a queue that you should claim if you 
think you’re the right partner to pursue it. You’ll see that the Action column 
­displays Accept for these types of leads.
To claim a lead from a queue, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Accept link for that record.
A link to the lead now appears in the Recent Items section in the sidebar. You 
can click it to review more information about your lead and update the lead 
status to begin pursuing this suspect.
2.	 Click Edit to update the lead.
After all, you want to be able to work on all the leads that you claimed so that 
your channel manager sees some results.
3.	 Click Save after you update the record.
The Lead page reappears.
Managing your opportunities
When a lead has progressed far enough in the sales process, you convert it into an 
opportunity. You can manage your existing opportunities and create new ones 
from the Opportunities tab. To update the deal information on an existing oppor-
tunity, following these steps:
1.	 Click the Opportunities tab at the top of your Partner Community.
2.	 Select the My Opportunities option from the List View drop-down menu to 
see a list of opportunities that you own, as shown in Figure 12-2.

192      PART 3  Closing More Deals with Sales Cloud
3.	 Click the Edit link next to the opportunity that you want to update.
4.	 Update the fields to reflect the latest developments in the sales deal.
5.	 When finished, click Save.
You are returned to the List View page.
Setting Up Salesforce Communities  
for Your Channel Team
Before setting up Salesforce Communities, your Salesforce administrator should 
meet with a member of the channel sales team to confirm your PRM needs. ­Discuss 
the following questions:
»
» What percentage of your sales force is indirect versus direct?
»
» What types of partners do you work with?
»
» Do you message differently to each type of partner?
»
» What are the objectives, challenges, and participation benefits for each type of 
partner in your program?
»
» How are your channel territories broken out?
»
» How are channel managers tracking partners’ sales and marketing activities 
today?

» How do channel managers put together their channel forecasts? How long 
does it take, and how accurate is the information?
Make sure that you set an appointment with your Salesforce.com customer ­success 
manager for some free advice or a blessing to go forward with using Salesforce 
Communities. Chances are, if answers to these questions show that your business 
relies heavily on an indirect sales force, yet your visibility into the channel pipe-
line is as clear as mud, you probably need Salesforce Communities.
Again, the information we give you is meant to prepare you to successfully imple-
ment Salesforce Communities. The details of all the cool features that you can 
activate are more thoroughly discussed within Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies,

S
alesforce provides robust customer service functionality in its Service Cloud 
product. The module is used to track and resolve cases, using a variety of 
features that allow agents to respond to cases as efficiently as possible. But 
it’s more than that as well.
With Service Cloud, you have all the tools at your fingertips to efficiently deliver 
excellent customer service while managing the costs of operations. In days and 
weeks, versus months and years, you can start and manage a fully integrated cus-
tomer service strategy that supports the many channels that customers use to 
communicate with you. Service Cloud also provides the ability to handle web chats 
from customers looking for help on your website, the ability for customers to log 
in to a private community where they can submit new cases and check up on 
existing ones, and a console where agents can minimize the number of clicks and 
additional pages they have to open to see information about a customer.
In this chapter, we introduce you to basic customer support functionality in Sales-
force, starting with its core concept: the case. We first discuss fundamental 
­support agent processes for handling new cases; then we cover how to manage the 
growing caseload. For more extensive knowledge of Service Cloud and imple-
menting its various features, check out Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies, by Jon 
Paz and TJ Kelley (Wiley).
Chapter 13

198      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
Walking through a Day in the  
Life of a Service Agent
Salesforce follows a general process when it comes to managing cases. Service 
agents (you may call them support reps) commonly perform these tasks on any 
given day. The specific tasks may be different in your company, but you probably 
see some similarities:
»
» Responding to inbound emails and calls
»
» Taking new cases from assigned queues
»
» Validating that the inquiry is coming from an authorized contact
»
» Creating a case to begin tracking efforts to resolve the issue
»
» Working the case backlog, including researching solutions
»
» Managing service-level agreements (SLAs)
»
» Communicating the resolution to the customer
At its core, customer support is all about accepting questions and answering them 
in a timely and consistent manner, while providing high levels of customer satis-
faction. How you handle your responses — and the scale on which you handle 
them — are more complicated issues.
If all your company’s Salesforce users have full licenses, and you just need to cap-
ture a fairly manageable influx of basic cases, you can do that without having to 
purchase full-blown separate Service Cloud licenses.
Understanding the Case Record
A case is a record of a customer service inquiry (you may call them tickets), as 
shown in Figure  13-1. Similar to other common records, such as accounts and 
contacts, you capture case-related information from a single detail page. And to 
manage all your cases, Salesforce comes out of the box with all the tools that you 
need for routing, queuing, and escalating cases, plus complying with SLAs, if that 
applies to your company.

CHAPTER 13  Tracking the Support Life Cycle with Cases      199
A case record comes preconfigured with standard fields and two icons commonly 
used for case management. Most of the standard fields are self-explanatory, but 
in the following list, we highlight key fields that are less obvious:
»
» Status: This field defines the important statuses in your case process. It 
comes preconfigured with a basic process, but you should modify the values 
to fit your process. If you’re an Enterprise or Unlimited Edition user, you can 
use this field to distinguish multiple support processes appropriate to the 
different kinds of cases you want to track.
»
» Case Number: When you create a case, Salesforce automatically assigns a 
sequential number used for tracking.
»
» Type: Use this picklist field to define the type of case. Salesforce presets this 
list with selections that include Problem and Question, but you can modify the 
picklist to match your categories.
»
» Case Reason: Use this picklist field to specify the reason the case was opened. 
Many companies track this field to identify areas of customer service that they 
can improve. Of course, you can also modify this list to suit your needs.
»
» Case Origin: Use this field to record from which channel the case originated — 
for example, by phone, email, or web. Many companies report on this field to 
understand and improve the methods by which customers interact with 
service and support agents.
»
» Internal Comments: When editing a case, use this field to jot brief comments 
to communicate internal messages, as needed. Customers or people outside 
your company will not see this field by default. However, internal comments 
that are marked Public may be viewed by clients in the Customer Portal, if you 
have it enabled.
You may also hear the term case feed. The case feed borrows functionality from 
Salesforce’s Chatter feature so that users can better collaborate around resolving 
FIGURE 13-1:  
Introducing the 
case record.

200      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
a particular case. If your organization has Chatter feed tracking enabled on the 
Case object, your Case record detail will look a little different than that of other 
standard objects. Internal discussions about a case appear on the Feed tab, next to 
the Details tab, which contains field details, as shown in Figure 13-2. This layout 
is meant to give agents quick access to Chatter discussions about the case or record 
details, with a minimum of page scrolling.
You’ll also notice that related lists still appear on the Details page as they do on 
any other standard record page. The left side also has quick links to the related 
lists, again so agents can quickly navigate to information. Speed is critical when 
interacting with a customer, and Salesforce provides as much information as pos-
sible to an agent without having to click off the screen to get to the right details.
Creating a Case
One of the main responsibilities of an agent is handling new inbound inquiries. 
Writing notes on a little sticky square that you attach to your monitor may not be 
the best way to track information, especially if you have terrible handwriting. In 
the following sections, we discuss how to begin the case management process in 
Salesforce so that the right information is tracked for the right customers.
Validating the contact
The first step in creating a case is validating the company and contact information 
to see whether any special circumstances or SLAs exist. This is less of a techno-
logical innovation than a general business best practice. You can’t have just any 
FIGURE 13-2:  
Viewing case 
details when 
Chatter is 
enabled on cases.

CHAPTER 13  Tracking the Support Life Cycle with Cases      201
random person taking up your precious time, can you? This information should 
reside in custom fields on the account record. For example, to do this in response 
to an inbound call, log in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Type the company name (or account number — whatever your company 
uses to identify its customers) into the search bar on the top of the home 
page and then click Search.
The Search Results page appears. You should see the account name listed.
If the account name is not listed, you should have some business processes in 
place to determine how to verify that the person or business calling in is, 
indeed, a customer.
2.	 Click the Account Name field.
The Account record appears. Verify the business’s information on this record 
that helps you identify that you’re allowed to support this company. You might 
verify an address or an account number. You should confirm those processes 
first before using cases.
3.	 Look at the Contact detail list to locate the person with the problem.
Again, depending on your company’s policies, you may or may not have 
specific customer contacts authorized to call you for support.
4.	 Click the Contact Name field.
The Contact record appears. Verify information on this record that helps you 
identify that this person is permitted to call for support. If the contact record 
doesn’t already exist, create a new contact record. For more information, turn 
to Chapter 9.
Entering new cases
After you qualify the customer, you have to associate a case to each new issue you 
receive. Because cases are associated with contacts, the best, most reliable way to 
create case records is by starting from the relevant Contact detail page. From the 
Contact detail page, you can add a case either by using the Create New drop-down 
list on the sidebar or by clicking the New button on the Cases related list. The 
result is the same in both situations, and you automatically prefill the Contact 
lookup field. By doing this, you can always find your case, and your case activities 
will be listed on the overall Contact detail page.
To create cases by using the best practice, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Contact detail page, click the New button on the Cases related list.
The Edit mode of a new case appears.

202      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
2.	 Fill in the fields as much as you can or as required.
Notice that the Contact field is prefilled with the contact you were working from.
3.	 When you’re done, click one of the following buttons:
•	 Save: Brings up the Case detail page.
•	 Save & Close: Saves the current case info and automatically takes you to the 
Close Case detail page, as shown in Figure 13-3, where you select the 
appropriate closed case status and add additional details. Use this page to 
quickly resolve an issue.
•	 Save & New: Saves the current contact info and automatically opens a new, 
blank contact record.
•	 Check Spelling: Checks the spelling of the contents of the Description field.
To clone a case, click the Clone button at the top or bottom of the case record. If 
it’s the day of a new product or feature release, and many customers are reporting 
the same problem, the Clone button will come in handy for you. Just remember to 
still skim the new copy that was cloned, to make sure you change certain fields 
(like the Contact), to be relevant for each customer. This is similar behavior across 
other records in the Salesforce family.
You can also set up Salesforce to generate a new case from an email sent to a spe-
cific address (like support@yourcompany.com), also known as the Email-to-Case 
feature. You have a few options, depending on your company’s email require-
ments. Or, you could always have a Web-to-Case form set up (similar to the 
­Web-to-Leads form that we discuss in Chapter 15). For details on how to set up 
Email-to-Case, read Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies.
FIGURE 13-3:  
Closing a case.

CHAPTER 13  Tracking the Support Life Cycle with Cases      203
Managing Cases
As a service or support agent, one of your key goals as a case owner is to address and 
resolve many customer issues as quickly as possible. Ideally, the need for speed is 
balanced with some defined processes to ensure a sense of order. Over time, your 
caseload will build up as different cases take different lengths of time to resolve. 
You’ll work off the Cases home page, which you access by clicking the Cases tab at 
the top of the page. There you’ll be able to see the most recent cases and adjust your 
views so that you can see the cases that are most relevant to you. For example, 
maybe you handle all the Platinum requests for the West Coast and just want to see 
those. In the following sections, we discuss how to manage your growing caseload.
If your company has several agents resolving cases for a variety of products and 
services, your administrator may set up case queues to automatically funnel cases 
to the right pairs of eyeballs. For example, you may use your website to collect both 
product and billing inquiries. Case queues would allow support agents to grab new 
cases from the product queue, while accounting operations staff can monitor the 
billing queue. Queues ensure that everyone has an equal chance at the latest cases.
Case queues are accessed from the same location as case views — the Case View 
drop-down list on the Cases home page.
To choose a case from a queue, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Cases home page, select the view that corresponds to a queue 
that you’re supposed to monitor.
The list page appears.
2.	 In the Action column of the case list, select the check boxes for the case 
records that you want to accept and begin working on.
If you don’t see an Accept hyperlink, you’re probably looking at a list view 
instead. See Chapter 17 for more information on list views.
3.	 Click Accept to take ownership of these cases.
You’ve now claimed these cases from the general pool of new cases.
Communicating the Outcome
After you research your case and find the right solutions for it, you must commu-
nicate this resolution to your customer before you officially mark the case closed. 
Make sure that your administrator has created appropriate case resolution emails 
for your support team.

204      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
Responding with standard email templates
Standard email templates allow you to merge your attached solutions into the body 
of an email template, which you then send to your customer. This increases the 
efficiency with which the support team can answer questions. For information on 
providing a response to a customer using an email template, turn to Chapter 5.
Closing a case
After you resolve your case and successfully notify your customer, it’s time to 
close the case and move on to the next one. One of the key advantages of Sales-
force is its easy-to-use reporting system (more about that in Chapter 23). Addi-
tional information is collected after you close a case, so support executives can use 
the collective feedback to continuously improve the customer experience.
To close a case, follow these steps:
1.	 From the case record, click the Close Case button.
Alternatively, if you’re on the Edit page for the case record, click Save & Close.
The Close Case page appears in Edit mode.
2.	 Select the appropriate closed case status and add any internal comments, 
if needed.
Other fields are shown based on your company’s customizations.
3.	 Click Save when you’re finished.
Solutions are a feature that is no longer being enhanced by Salesforce.com. Service 
Cloud does allow the ability to create and apply canned responses to cases, to 
reduce repetitive typing by agents for commonly reported issues. If you want to 
learn more about options available, check out Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies.

Preparing Your Salesforce  
Service Cloud Strategy
As is the case with any new endeavor, you need to put some time and thought into 
a viable strategy to set you up for success. In order to prepare for some of the great 
Service Cloud features available to you, think about what you want to get out of 
this project. Are you having problems keeping your customers happy? Are you 
looking to reduce cost? Increase profit margins? Maybe you just want to reduce 
call agent attrition and make their lives easier? Identifying these reasons upfront 
will help you plan where you’re going with your implementation.
Planning the implementation
As a support executive, if you want to get Service Cloud working for you, you need 
to do some careful upfront planning. After you think through your processes, you 
can customize cases either by yourself or with your Service Cloud administrator.
Here are some tips to think about before you get started:
»
» Define and prioritize your service and support objectives.
»
» Identify and acknowledge your key challenges. Try to identify the biggest 
ones first.
»
» Start with the end in mind. The best way to customize your application is to 
decide what you want to measure first.
»
» Map out your key processes. If you’re a Visio whiz, use that tool. If not, grab 
a marker and diagram your key processes on a whiteboard or flip chart. For 
different types of support issues, think about the similar and different types of 
information that you want your reps to capture.
»
» Figure out the best approach for your business. You have many different 
ways to tackle a business issue with Service Cloud — some of these 
approaches work better than others.
»
» Assess how much of your support efforts you and your team can share 
with your customers. If your users would welcome this sort of change, you 
may want to set up the community.
»
» Keep it simple. Don’t sacrifice your objectives just to keep things simple. The 
more complexity you build, the greater the risk that people won’t use the 
application.

CHAPTER 14  Diversifying Your Support Channels      207
For cases, as with other objects, Service Cloud provides some common design ele-
ments that let you customize the record. As you consider customizing cases, keep 
in mind that you should strive for ease of use, relevance, and data that can help 
you manage your support executive job while allowing your agents to efficiently 
manage theirs. (See Chapter 17 for the how-to details on adding new fields, cus-
tomizing page layouts, adding record types, and other design tricks.)
Identifying your support channels
When you’ve decided that you want to provide multiple channels for your custom-
ers to get the support they need, you need to do some upfront work to determine 
which channels you’ll support, as well as how it all comes together. By offering 
various avenues through which your customers can get to your agents, you’ll 
quickly learn that in doing so you are not only increasing customer (and call cen-
ter employee) satisfaction, but also reducing expenses as call volumes decrease.
Which support channels do you currently have? Make a list of what you have and 
compare it to your desired future state. When you’re ready, read on.
Delighting Customers with  
Multi-Channel Support
Multi-channel support is an obvious boon to any organization with loyal custom-
ers. Offering your customers various means to reach the same end, issue resolu-
tion, has two key benefits:
»
» Increased customer satisfaction: Customers can interact with your business 
the way they want to.
»
» Decreased operational cost: Providing answers via multiple avenues keeps 
call volume down and your agents focused on more complex cases.
Where in the past each channel lived in its own silo (marketing owned social data, 
call center managers oversaw daily call volumes, and IT departments managed 
web traffic), Service Cloud offers a holistic view of customer activity and real-time 
analytics into the utilization of each channel. Now executives and key decision-
makers have visibility into channel popularity and can nimbly pivot toward more 
frequently used channels and divest from those left in the dust. Agents see 
­customers’ preferred method of contact and engage with them the way they like.
Let’s take a look at some of the features Service Cloud has to help you connect with 
your customers via multiple channels.

208      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
Web-to-Case
In addition to using the phone, your customers may want to reach you directly 
from your website. With the Web-to-Case feature in Salesforce, your customers 
fill out a brief form on your company website that automatically creates a case in 
Salesforce for agents to start working. You can quickly generate a standard HTML 
form to put on any page; when the customer clicks Submit, the form is sent to 
Salesforce’s servers, which converts the information to a case. This is one of the 
fastest ways a customer can submit an inquiry, and one of the easiest ways to 
increase agent productivity and response time.
Web-to-Case is a certain choice for customer service because customers immedi-
ately navigate to a company’s website when they have problems or need help. To 
be sure, Web-to-Case does have a few limitations and you do need to do some 
upfront prep work before diving in and implementing it. We go over those details 
in a bit. But Web-to-Case is one of the most common tools businesses use to 
automate case creation directly from their site, and after setting it up, you’ll see 
how easy it is to do in Service Cloud.
NOTING WEB-TO-CASE LIMITATIONS
Before jumping in and discussing how Web-to-Case works and how to set it up, let’s talk 
about a few of its limitations to keep in mind:
•	 5,000 cases per 24-hour period: If the number of cases entered via Web-to-Case 
exceeds 5,000, Salesforce sends an email to the address associated with the default 
case owner containing the additional case details. Salesforce queues these addi-
tional cases in a pending request queue and then submits them when the 24-hour 
period is over. If your organization requires the ability to capture more than 
5,000 cases via web daily, submit a request to Salesforce.com customer support 
to increase the limit.
•	 No attachments: At this point in time, Web-to-Case does not support adding 
attachments.
•	 No rich text: Adding rich text area fields on Web-to-Case forms is possible, but the 
information captured within them is saved as plain text when the case is created in 
Salesforce.
•	 No spam filters: Salesforce accepts it all and does not natively filter out spam, 
although you can set up validation rules and workflows to filter out cases that 
appear to be spam.

CHAPTER 14  Diversifying Your Support Channels      209
Preparing for Web-to-Case
Ensure the following before enabling Web-to-Case to make the setup as smooth 
as possible:
»
» Create an email template for the customer. Make sure you have an 
available default email template that your customers receive when they 
submit a case. Include a case number or confirmation number that the 
customer can reference. (See Chapter 4 for more information about email 
templates.)
»
» Create active case assignment rules. Build assignment rules to assign a 
case to a default user or queue. If you don’t have active assignment rules or if 
the case doesn’t meet their criteria, the owner of a web-generated case will 
default to the owner indicated in your organization’s support settings. 
(See Chapter 5 for more on setting up assignment rules.)
»
» Customize support settings. Use support settings to select a default case 
owner that serves as a net for those cases that do not meet your assignment 
rule criteria. To do this, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Cases ➪ Support 
Settings, click Edit, and in the Default Case Owner field select the desired user 
or queue.
Now you’re ready to set up Web-to-Case for your organization.
Enabling Web-to-Case
To set up Web-to-Case, you must first enable it for your organization. Choose 
Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Self-Service ➪ Web-to-Case, and follow these steps:
1.	 On the Capturing Cases from Your Website page, review the listed steps 
and then click the Generate the HTML link.
2.	 Move the fields you want to display on the Web-to-Case form from the 
Available Fields column to the Selected column by clicking the Add arrow.
3.	 Enter the URL to which the user returns after submitting the form, and click 
Generate.
Most web forms direct users to a thank you/submitted page or a support 
home page.
4.	 Copy and paste the provided HTML code on your website or into a page 
hosted on your web server, and click Finished.
If this step seems too technical for you, copy and paste the code into an email 
and send it to someone on your web services or IT team.

210      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
When the web form is up and running, test the form by filling it out, and clicking 
Submit, and ensuring it routes to the appropriate party in Salesforce and captures 
the information entered.
Your organization is now able to auto-generate cases via a simple HTML web form 
that integrates directly into Service Cloud.
Email-to-Case
Service Cloud allows agents to quickly and efficiently manage cases through email 
as well. By sending an inquiry to an email address set up for your support team, 
Salesforce automatically creates a case in Salesforce and auto-populates relevant 
case fields, including any attachments the customer sends. If the sender’s email 
address matches a Contact’s email address in Salesforce, Email-to-Case will 
associate the new case to that Contact record, as well as the Contact’s Account 
record. What’s more, agents can reply to the email directly from the case, captur-
ing the entire email thread and customer interaction in one place.
Computer telephony integration (CTI)
The more traditional support channel, the telephone, is not going away anytime 
soon. Service Cloud supports phone inquiry efficiency in call centers, which is just 
as important as more modern channels. CTI — technology that facilitates the 
interaction between or integration of telephone and computer — is commonly 
used in call centers. It comes in many shapes and sizes but generally reaches the 
same objective: enabling agents to respond to customers as quickly and effectively 
as possible with very little needed from the customer.
Live Agent Chat
Another way Salesforce allows your customers to reach you without picking up the 
phone is through chat. Live Agent Chat is a native chat application that is the 
quickest way to get in front of your customer and at the lowest cost to you. How 
customized you want your Live Agent Chat to be is up to you. It can range in com-
plexity depending on that decision.
In order to implement the feature, you have to enable Live Agent, create Live 
Agent users by giving them access to it, and customize it according to your prefer-
ences and settings.

CHAPTER 14  Diversifying Your Support Channels      211
Enabling Live Agent
To enable Live Agent for your organization, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Live 
Agent ➪ Settings. Then select Enable Live Agent and click Save.
If the Live Agent menu does not appear under Setup, contact Salesforce.com Sup-
port to enable this feature in your organization.
After enabling Live Agent for your organization, you must either create or modify 
pre-existing user records to provide the relevant Live Agent permissions neces-
sary for them to do their jobs. There are different aspects of Live Agent permis-
sions that are enabled in different places.
Adding Live Agent users
In order to have individual users work as Live Agents and support your customers 
through chat, they need some minor adjustments to their user records. Choose 
Setup ➪ Manage Users ➪ Users, and then follow these steps:
1.	 Click Edit to the left of the user who will be a Live Agent.
Alternatively, click the New User button and create a new user.
2.	 On the user record, check the Live Agent User check box.
3.	 Click Save.
If you can’t find the Live Agent User check box, your organization needs to buy 
more Live Agent feature licenses.
Granting Live Agent users the right permissions
You’ve checked the Live Agent User check box on the agent’s user record, but 
that’s only half the battle. You also have to ensure that your agents have the per-
missions necessary to accomplish the tasks your company has set out for them. 
You can accomplish this in one of two ways:
»
» Profiles: Create or enhance a specific profile to contain these specific 
permissions bundled within it and assign your Live Agent users to it.
»
» Permission sets: Create a Live Agent permission set that contains only Live 
Agent permissions and assign them to the relevant users.
How do you know which option to take? Look at the number of users. Do you have 
20 Live Agent users or 3? If your number of Live Agent users is small, add a per-
mission set. Otherwise, create a new profile for your Live Agent users. Just be wary 
of creating too many profiles — administrating an environment with a large 
number of profiles can quickly become difficult.

212      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
ADMINISTRATIVE PERMISSIONS
All Live Agent users need to have the API Enabled permission.
STANDARD OBJECT PERMISSIONS
The object-level permissions necessary for your Live Agents depend in part on the 
features you’re implementing. For example, if agents need to see visitor and tran-
script records, they’ll need (at the very least) Read permissions on the Live Chat 
Visitors and Live Chat Transcripts objects. In order for them to create Quick Text, 
users need full access (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) permissions on the Quick Text 
object, while seeing Live Agent Sessions requires at least Read permissions on 
that object.
Managers or supervisors may need a higher level of permissions, such as Edit, in 
order to modify records that agents are working on.
Adding Live Agent skills
After setting up your Live Agent users, add Live Agent skills if your company seg-
ments agents into different skill groupings. For example, your customers are nor-
mally routed to a first-tier customer service representative for common issues 
(for example, resetting passwords, making address changes, paying by phone, 
and so on), but more complex problems are directed to second-tier engineers (for 
technical assistance and troubleshooting). In this case, you would create two skill 
sets to segment those agents into the appropriate skill groups.
In Salesforce, you can identify and segment your agents’ skills and then assign 
those users to the appropriate skill set so that Salesforce routes your customer 
requests accordingly.
To create a skill in Salesforce, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Live Agent ➪ Skills, and 
then follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New button.
2.	 Name the new skill.
3.	 Assign users and profiles to the skill.
You can assign both individual users that have the skill, as well as entire profiles.
4.	 Click Save.
The skill you’ve just created appears on the screen, with its name and its assigned 
users and profiles.

CHAPTER 14  Diversifying Your Support Channels      213
Assigning Live Agent configurations
Live Agent configurations are packaged pieces of functionality to manage Live 
Agent in the Salesforce console. They’re also used to control the Live Agent Con-
sole, but this feature is no longer available for new Live Agent customers.
Like Live Agent skills, Live Agent configurations are assigned at the user or profile 
level and are responsible for toggling certain settings in the console, such as
»
» The number of simultaneous chat sessions an agent can have
»
» Notifications and sounds when the agent has a new chat request
»
» Whether an agent can transfer the chat to another agent or even receive files 
through the chat window
You can assign different Live Agent configurations to different users and profiles, 
based on the agent’s level of experience or expertise. Consider a new agent that is 
still training: That agent should probably be grouped in a configuration that 
allows no more than three chats at any given time. Similarly, you can assign a 
seasoned agent on your team a configuration that allows for up to seven chats at 
once. You may want to disable chat transfer for some users while giving this con-
figuration to others.
Creating Live Agent deployments  
and chat ­buttons
If you’re planning to implement Live Agent Chat, your website visitors need a 
clearly visible button on your site that indicates help is available if they need it. 
Chat buttons for Live Agent are what customers should click when they want to 
initiate a chat with one of your agents.
Talk to your IT or web team before implementing chat buttons. To customize 
them, you need to have a Force.com site set up or use some custom code.
You can put multiple chat buttons on your page or deployment, with each button 
mapped to a specific skill that you’ve already created. In this way, clicking an 
Internet Issues button will not route you to the same agent as clicking a Telephone 
Connectivity button.
Assuming you’ve already set up a skill or two, start building your button by choos-
ing Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Live Agent ➪ Chat Buttons & Invitations, and then follow 
these steps.
1.	 Click the New button.
2.	 From the Type picklist, select Chat Button.

214      PART 4  Providing Support with Service Cloud
3.	In the Name field, enter a name for your new chat button.
4.	The Developer Name field should auto-populate with the same name you 
provided in the Name field.
The field will have underscores instead of spaces because it’s an API name.
5.	Choose a routing type from the picklist.
This setting determines how customers are routed to various skills:
•	 Choice: An inbound chat enters a queue, and any agent assigned the 
appropriate skill can pick it up.
•	 Least Active: Automatically routes the inbound chat to the least active agent 
(measured by number of open chats) that is assigned the appropriate skill.
•	 Most Available: Routes the inbound chat to the most available agent 
(measured by chat capacity minus number of open chats).
6.	Associate specific skills with the button by selecting one or more skills in the 
Available Skills column and clicking the Add arrow to move them into the 
Selected Skills column.
7.	Select the language for the text in your chat window.
8.	In the Push Timeout field, enter the time agents have to answer inbound 
chats before the chats are rerouted.
This only applies to you if you selected Least Active or Most Available from the 
Routing Type picklist in Step 5.
9.	Fill in the remaining fields in the Basic Information section.
If you have a Force.com site to use for button customizations, enter the 
information in the Chat Button Customization section.
10.	Click Save.
The button detail page is displayed with generated chat button code you can 
copy and paste into your site’s HTML.
Deployments are places on your site where you deploy Live Agent Chat. You create 
deployments in much the same way as buttons. Like button creation, deployments 
also require copying and pasting provided code on each web page where you’ll be 
deploying Live Agent.
There are more customization options for Live Agent that are not outlined here, 
but now you have the basics down and you’re ready to start chatting with your 
customers!

CHAPTER 14  Diversifying Your Support Channels      215
DIRECTING CUSTOMERS TO  
SELF-SERVICE OPTIONS
You’d be surprised by how many customers would prefer to get the answers them-
selves (if they only knew where to go), rather than call you. One of the most obvious 
benefits to implementing a multi-channel approach to your customer support business 
is that customers can help themselves.
Whether you implement Live Agent Chat to allow customers to contact your reps from 
your website without waiting on hold, or set up a community for customers to search 
frequently discussed questions or issues, you can allow your customers to solve their 
own issues, decreasing call volume to your call centers.
Salesforce Communities are branded online spaces for employees, customers, or part-
ners to connect. You can choose to reveal a subset of your Salesforce data to partners, 
for example, so that they can help you work a deal. Alternatively, you can share files or 
answers to FAQs with your customers to help them help themselves. See Chapter 12 
for more information on setting up a community for your channel partners.
You can also improve your agents’ response times so that they don’t have to constantly 
retype repetitive solutions, and your call center managers can track topic trends to pro-
vide feedback to product and marketing teams.
Customer service is more important than ever before to secure loyal consumers. As 
excellent customer service becomes an expectation and not a luxury, consumers are 
becoming more demanding than ever. Companies need to be proactive and can no 
longer afford to be reactive. One of the most effective ways to do this is by making your 
service about your customer.
Let your clients choose the way they want to get in touch. Provide different options for 
your customers to receive consistent service, regardless of where they are or what time 
it is. This is the essence of true customer support and is the purpose of offering a multi-
channel strategy.

C
ompanies want to increase revenue by spending marketing dollars intelli-
gently. However, because of the disconnect between sales and marketing 
teams, managers have a harder time executing campaigns, let alone track-
ing and measuring the results of their marketing programs. Now, more than ever, 
marketing departments have to prove that they’re contributing to the sales funnel 
instead of being regarded as a cost center. Marketing executives have to show that 
their marketing spending is resulting in new customers. If this sounds familiar to 
you, campaigns in Salesforce can help you manage and track your marketing pro-
grams more effectively, helping you manage your customer acquisition costs, 
bring in more qualified leads, and contribute more to sales.
A campaign is any marketing project that you want to plan, manage, and track in 
Salesforce. The higher-level goal is to create something (a content piece or an 
event, for example) that generates demand for your product or service. Depending 
on your current or planned strategies, types of campaigns include trade shows, 
search engine marketing, email marketing messages, online promotions, webi-
nars, online events, and print advertising, although this is by no means a com-
plete list.
Chapter 15

220      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
In this chapter, you find out how to create and manage campaigns, segment target 
lists, execute campaigns, track responses, and analyze campaign effectiveness.
To administer campaigns, you must be a system administrator or a user with per-
mission to manage campaigns (that is, a marketing manager type). See Chapter 21 
for details on configuring your user information and profile to manage campaigns.
Understanding Campaigns
Available for users of Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited Edition, the Cam-
paign module in Salesforce is a set of tools that you use to manage, track, and 
measure your marketing programs. Its foundation is the campaign record, which 
can be manually or automatically linked to lead, contact, and/or opportunity 
records to provide real metrics on campaign effectiveness.
A campaign record comes standard with a set of fields that help you manage and 
track your campaigns. Here are the fields used most often to measure campaign 
effectiveness:
»
» Campaign Name: This is the name of your marketing project. Choose a 
name that’s readily obvious to sales reps and other users whose leads or 
contacts might be included in the campaign. For example, if you send 
monthly email newsletters, you might distinguish each campaign by month,  
as in “Administrators Newsletter — May 14” and “Support Agent 
Newsletter — June 15.”
»
» Type: This drop-down list includes the types of campaigns that you run within 
your marketing mix (Direct Mail, Email, and so on).
»
» Status: This drop-down list defines the statuses of a campaign. Salesforce 
provides a simple default drop-down list of statuses to measure a campaign’s 
progress, from the initial planning stages to completion. By using this field, 
you and others can make sure that the campaign is on track.
»
» Start Date: This date field tracks when a campaign begins.
»
» End Date: This date field tracks when a campaign ends.
»
» Expected Revenue: This currency field estimates how much revenue the 
campaign will generate.
»
» Budgeted Cost: This is the amount that you have budgeted for the marketing 
project.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      221
»
» Actual Cost: This is the amount that the project actually cost.
»
» Expected Response: This percentage field is your best guess of the response 
rate of a campaign. For example, if your email campaigns typically receive a 
2 percent response rate, you might use this value to benchmark the effective-
ness of the campaign you’ll be tracking in Salesforce.
»
» Num Sent: This is the amount of people targeted in the campaign. For 
example, if you executed an email campaign to 10,000 email addresses, that 
would be your Num Sent.
»
» Active: This check box marks whether a campaign is active. If you don’t select 
it, the particular campaign doesn’t appear in reports or on related lists and 
other campaign drop-down lists on lead, contact, and opportunity records.
»
» Description: This field allows you to describe the campaign so that other 
users who want more detailed information on the campaign can get a solid 
snapshot.
Depending on your marketing processes, terminology, and goals, you or your sys-
tem administrator should modify the drop-down list values and change the fields 
on the record. (See Chapter 17 for details on customizing Salesforce.)
If you’re a marketing manager, you can plan and manage the majority of your 
campaign preparation inside Salesforce. You can
»
» Lay out your entire marketing plan of projects.
»
» Build the basic framework and business case for a project.
»
» Define statuses and success metrics for campaign responses. Success metrics 
measure how you determine whether the campaign was worth your com-
pany’s time, money, and effort.
»
» Develop a detailed project plan so that important tasks get accomplished.
In the following sections, we show you where and how to accomplish these tasks.
Depending on the volume and variety of campaigns your company runs, and how 
complex your lead qualification strategies are, you may be using a separate cloud-
based marketing automation product. Many of them provide integrations with 
Salesforce through AppExchange packages. It’s key to understand Salesforce ter-
minology for concepts associated with the Campaign object, because there may be 
slight differences in semantics with what another vendor may use.

222      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
Creating a new campaign
To create a campaign, log in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Campaign option from the Create New drop-down list on 
the taskbar.
A New Campaign page appears, as shown in Figure 15-1.
2.	 Fill in the fields as much as possible or as required.
If you manage marketing programs for your company, you should see few 
surprises in the campaign fields. See the preceding section for a summary of 
the standard entry fields.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
Optionally, you can click Save & New if you have more than one campaign to 
create and want to immediately start on the next one.
After you save your final campaign, the campaign page reappears with the infor-
mation you entered, as well as additional system-generated fields that automati-
cally update as your company makes progress on a campaign.
FIGURE 15-1:  
Fill in the 
campaign record.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      223
You can associate campaigns to a parent campaign and see the aggregate perfor-
mance statistics in one place. For example, our Salesforce.com For Dummies, 
6th Edition Launch Event could be a parent campaign to other campaigns such as 
Email Drop, Banner Ad, and Dreamforce book signing. To group campaigns into a 
campaign hierarchy, have your Salesforce administrator add the Parent Campaign 
field to your Campaign page layout. You can then use that field to associate child 
campaigns with a parent. See Chapter 17 for more information on page layouts.
Modifying the member status
A campaign member is a lead or a contact who’s part of a specific campaign. 
Depending on the type of campaign you’re running, you can modify the campaign 
to have a unique set of member statuses. For example, the member statuses that 
you track for an email campaign (Sent, Responded) are typically different from 
those of a trade show that you’re sponsoring.
To customize member statuses for a specific campaign, follow these steps:
1.
Go to the campaign record and click the Advanced Setup button.
The Campaign Member Status page for your campaign appears. When you 
first begin to create campaigns, Salesforce creates a default set of member 
status values of Sent and Responded.
2.
In the Member Status Values related list, click the Edit button.
The Campaign Member Status page appears in Edit mode, as shown in 
Figure 15-2.
3.
Modify statuses by entering a new value in the Member Status column.
For example, if you’re sponsoring a booth at a conference, the preregistrants 
list is part of the package, and if you want to invite attendees to visit your 
booth, you might add member statuses of Registered, Invited, Attended, 
Visited Booth, and Met at Show.

4.	 Select the check box in the Responded column to classify a status as 
responded.
This field tracks the Expected Response Rate field against the actual response 
rate.
5.	 Use the Default column to select a default value.
6.	 Click Save.
The Campaign Member Status page reappears with your changes.
Building Target Lists
One of the biggest challenges that marketing managers face is developing the 
right target lists for a campaign. Target lists are the lists of people you’re targeting 
in your campaign. Depending on the type of campaign that you’re planning, your 
lists might come from different sources, such as rented or purchased lists from 
third-party providers or existing lists of leads and contacts already entered in 
Salesforce. If your target list is composed of the latter, you can create your target 
list directly from the Salesforce Reports tab and associate specific campaigns to 
those leads and contacts, or you may add leads and contacts directly to specific 
campaigns.
Using rented lists
With a rented list, your options are limited. Depending on the circumstances, 
sometimes you don’t know who’s on the list because the list is controlled by the 
vendor. Other times, you agree to limited use terms, such as one-time usage. In 
these circumstances, simply use the external list as the target list instead of 
importing the list into Salesforce.
You can use Salesforce to improve the quality of rented lists. Many third-party 
vendors look for duplicate names, confirm that they all point to the same person, 
and then help you merge them into one file. They do this by comparing their data-
base against your customer database when they’re generating the record count for 
a rented list. As long as you can trust the vendor, you can quickly use Salesforce to 
generate a file of your existing contacts to compare. By getting rid of duplicates 
first, you can stretch your marketing dollars by making sure that you’re not pay-
ing for contacts you already have. And if you’re doing a mixed campaign of rented 
and owned lists, you stand a better chance of not upsetting a customer with dupli-
cate mail.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      225
Importing new campaign members
If you own or purchase a list and intend for your teams to follow up on all the 
records, you can import the list into Salesforce as lead records and automatically 
link the records to a campaign. Here, we show you how to select a list on your 
computer to import, mass-associate various characteristics to the list (such as the 
lead source or campaign), perform the import, and verify that your settings came 
through.
To import a list and attribute it to a campaign, follow these steps:
1.	On the campaign record, click the Advanced Setup button, verify that the 
member statuses are accurate, and then return to the campaign record by 
clicking the Back button in your browser.
2.	Click the Manage Members button.
A drop-down list appears.
3.	Choose the Add Members – Import File option.
The Campaign Member Import Wizard starts.
4.	Choose the right-pointing arrow (>) next to the Leads option.
This kicks off the Import Wizard. Indicate what kind of data you’re importing 
(Leads).
5.	Select what you what type of import you want to do.
You can choose to add new records, update existing ones, or both. In this 
example, select Add New Records. The selected option expands.
6.	If your import included leads that may already be in Salesforce, choose an 
option for the Match Lead By picklist.
You can confirm an existing record by matching on the lead’s name, its email, 
or a Salesforce unique ID.
7.	(Optional) Use the drop-down list to select a lead source that the imported 
leads will be associated with.
8.	(Optional) Use the next drop-down list to select an assignment rule.
9.	(Optional) Select the Use Assignment Rule Settings to Send Notification 
Emails to Record Owners check box.
10.	By default, these imported leads will be assigned to the campaign that you 
were on before invoking the Import Wizard.
11.	(Optional) Select the Trigger Workflow Rules and Processes check box if you 
want workflow rules and processes to kick in on these records.

226      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
12.	Prepare your file, following the instructions that the wizard gives you.
Here are the main steps to perform:
a.	 Add and fill in a column for Member Status unless all records will use the default 
member status.
or
Add and fill in a column for Lead Owner unless you’ll be the owner or you’re 
applying lead assignment rules.
b.	 Save the file in a .csv format on your computer.
13.	In the wizard, click what type of .csv file you want to upload.
A Choose File dialog box appears. Leave the Character Code option as is.
14.	Locate your file and click Open.
The dialog box closes, and the filename appears in the field.
15.	When you’re done, click Next.
The Edit Mapping step of the wizard appears, where you confirm the mapping 
of the Salesforce field to the correct column in your uploaded file.
16.	Map the fields by comparing the rows in the Mapped Salesforce Object 
column against the corresponding CSV Header column.
Salesforce will try to do some automatic mapping in an attempt to save you 
some time. If a mapping is incorrect, click Change in the Edit column for the 
row you want to fix. If a row didn’t map automatically at all, click Map in the Edit 
column to establish the mapping yourself.
A pop-up window appears listing the Lead’s fields. Select a field to confirm that 
you want that field mapped with the corresponding .csv header, and click 
Map.
17.	When you’re done, click Next.
The Review & Start Import step of the wizard appears.
18.	Review and confirm your selections, how many fields you’ve mapped, and 
how many fields on the .csv that you haven’t mapped. When you’re done, 
click the Start Import button.
A confirmation window pops up. Because large files may take a while, you’ll be 
emailed when your import has finished. Your new campaign members will 
appear under your campaign record, which you can access from the Campaign 
tab.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      227
Targeting existing members with the  
Integrated Campaign Builder
Assuming that your company has already imported users’ leads and contacts, you 
can build your target lists directly in Salesforce in three ways:
»
» Associating existing leads and contacts en masse to a campaign
»
» Adding members from custom reports
»
» Adding members from a List View
After you link your desired leads or contacts with a specific campaign, you can 
begin to target them.
Adding members from a campaign record
To associate existing leads or contacts with a campaign you’re planning, start by 
making sure that you can see the leads or contacts via a List View. See Chapter 17 
for information on creating List Views. You can add as many as 200 leads or con-
tacts per List View page. Then follow these steps:
1.	 From the specific campaign record, click the Manage Members button.
A picklist appears.
2.	 Select the Add Members – Search option.
In this example, we add existing leads. The Manage Members Wizard appears.
3.	 In the Manage Members Wizard, do the following:
a.	 From the Add Members subtab, in the Choose Member Type to Search section, 
confirm that the Leads radio button is selected.
This is the default.
b.	 Specify the Filter Criteria.
You may use an existing view or create new criteria now to get the leads you 
want for this campaign.
If you’re not yet sure what subset of leads to use, step back and give this 
some thought. Emailing all the leads in your database may not be a 
wise decision.
4.	 Click Go after you select your criteria.
The search results appear below the filter criteria.
5.	 Select the check box next to the appropriate leads that you want to be added 
to this campaign, as shown in Figure 15-3.

228      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
6.	 Click the Add with Status drop-down list to immediately select and associate 
the member status with those selected leads.
Your selected leads now appear on the Existing Members subtab.
Don’t worry. If your itchy trigger finger got you to add some members before 
you were ready, you can use the handy Remove button to disassociate the 
members from this campaign and start over again.
7.	 Repeat Steps 2–6, selecting new views, as needed.
8.	 Click the Back to Campaign: Campaign Name link below the Manage Members 
page name when finished.
The campaign record reappears.
Adding members from a custom report
As many as 50,000 leads or contacts in a single lead, contact, or campaign report 
may be associated with a campaign. To add existing members by running a report, 
follow these steps:
1.	 From the Reports home page, click a custom report of the leads or 
contacts that you’ll be targeting. (See Chapter 23 for more information on 
creating custom reports.)
A Reports page appears, as shown in Figure 15-4.
2.	 Click the Add to Campaign button.
The Add Members Wizard appears.
3.	 Select an existing campaign for the Campaign field. Use the Lookup icon to 
search for your match.
FIGURE 15-3:  
View leads to

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      229
4.	 After a campaign is selected, choose the appropriate status from the 
Member Status drop-down list, as shown in Figure 15-5.
5.	 Use the radio buttons to toggle whether you want the existing member 
statuses to be overridden by this member status.
The default is to not override existing member statuses.
6.	 Click Add to Campaign to continue.
Step 2 of the wizard appears with a status message of your attempt.
7.	 Click Done when you’ve verified the information.
You’re returned to your custom report page.
Adding members from a view
If you’ve followed our example to this point, from any lead or contact view page, 
you can add members to campaigns. Note that the capability to add members to 
campaigns from any lead or contact view page allows only marketing managers to 
select and add members one page at a time, so it’s best for adding a small amount 
of members. If your view is more than one page, you have to advance to that page 
FIGURE 15-4:

members to a 
campaign.
FIGURE 15-5:

members.

230      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
and then add members. To add a member from a List View, make sure that the 
view has already been created and follow these steps:
1.	 At the view’s results page, select the check box next to the appropriate 
member names that you want to add to your campaign.
In Figure 15-6, we add some contacts to a campaign.
2.	 Click the Add to Campaign button after your members have been selected.
The Add Members Wizard appears.
3.	 Select an existing campaign for the Campaign field. Use the Lookup icon to 
search for your match.
4.	 After a campaign is selected, choose the appropriate status from the 
Member Status drop-down list.
5.	 Click Add to Campaign to continue.
Step 2 of the wizard appears with a status message of your attempt.
6.	 Click Done when information has been verified.
You return to your view page.
Executing Campaigns
Depending on the type of campaigns you’re running, you might execute those 
campaigns online, offline, or in combination. And, based on the complexity of the 
campaign and your resources, you can use Salesforce to assist with the execution 
parts of your campaign.
Delivering an online campaign
If you send email campaigns as part of your marketing strategy (and who doesn’t 
nowadays), you can use Salesforce for elements of the execution. Those elements 
may include
FIGURE 15-6:  
Add list members 
to a campaign.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      231
»
» Exporting an email list from Salesforce for delivery to your email execution 
vendor or internal resource
»
» Building a web form to capture leads as part of your email’s or webinar 
campaign’s call to action (see the later section “Using Web-to-Lead forms”)
»
» Using standard email templates with merge fields so that you can control 
the look and feel of your messaging
You can use Salesforce to deliver and track mass emails, but Salesforce Sales Cloud 
wasn’t originally designed or intended to be used for large-scale, mass email mar-
keting. Some Salesforce customers use the mass emailing tool for small campaigns.
Salesforce Marketing Cloud and several email automation vendors have integrated 
email execution tools with Salesforce’s Sales Cloud. With this integration, mar-
keting managers can more seamlessly deliver larger volumes of email campaigns 
and track it in the cloud. The costs and functionality vary across the email mar-
keting vendors, so check out the options on the Force.com AppExchange directory 
at www.appexchange.com. Search using the keyword email or talk with your 
account executive for more information on how Salesforce Marketing Cloud could 
help.
Executing an offline campaign
If you execute offline campaigns, you can also use Salesforce in a variety of ways 
to simplify the process. How you use Salesforce depends on the type of campaign, 
but here are some suggestions:
»
» If you’re sponsoring a conference: Set up an online registration form for 
your booth computers to capture information on attendees who visit 
your booth.
»
» If you’re sending out direct-mail pieces: Use Salesforce to generate lists for 
your fulfillment vendor.
Tracking Responses
After you launch a campaign, you can use Salesforce to track responses. In Sales-
force, you have three basic types of tracking mechanisms, which we describe in 
the following sections.

232      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
To track responses on a campaign, you need to be able to view the Campaign 
related list on lead and contact records. If you can’t view this list, see Chapter 17 
on customizing page layouts or ask your system administrator for help.
Using Web-to-Lead forms
Whenever we help clients with using Salesforce, we take a look at their Contact Us 
web page. If it’s filled with a bunch of email addresses (like info@mycompany.com), 
we immediately recommend that they get Web-to-Lead up and running. After all, 
a company with a website using Salesforce in this day and age should take advan-
tage of capturing information via an online form.
Web-to-Lead is a Salesforce feature that enables your company to easily capture 
leads from your websites and automatically generate new leads in Salesforce. With 
Web-to-Lead, you can collect information from your websites and generate as 
many as 500 new leads daily. Say that you already have a registration or lead form 
on your public website. With Salesforce, you can — in minutes — generate HTML 
code that your webmaster can apply to your existing form. Then, when people fill 
out the form on your website, the information is routed instantaneously to users 
in Salesforce. By using Web-to-Lead, your reps can follow up on leads in a timely 
manner.
Specifically for campaign tracking, you can also create forms for specific landing 
pages designed for a unique campaign to capture information on a campaign 
member who responds.
Before you can capture leads from an external web page, though, you need to 
enable Web-to-Lead, add any additional custom fields to your lead record, gener-
ate the HTML code, and add the code to a web page. Of course, involve your web 
team and web designers to test and review the page before it goes live.
Enabling Web-to-Lead
All Salesforce customers can capture leads from web forms. First, check whether 
you need to turn it on for your company.
Log in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Leads ➪ Web-to-Lead.
The Web-to-Lead Setup page appears. Under Web-to-Lead Settings, make sure 
that Web-to-Lead is enabled. You can tell by looking for the Web-to Lead 
Enabled check box. If it’s selected, you’re good to go. If not, go to the next step.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      233
2.	 If Web-to-Lead isn’t enabled, click the Edit button.
The Web-to-Lead Settings edit page appears.
3.	 Fill out the fields on the page.
Salesforce provides three fields:
•	 Web-to-Lead Enabled: Select this check box.
•	 Default Lead Creator: Use the Lookup icon to select the default creator for 
when a lead is generated from a web form. You usually select the user who 
manages marketing campaigns for your organization.
•	 Default Response Template: Select a default email response template. You 
don’t need to have one, but it’s a good practice to reply to leads so that 
they know you got their request.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Web-to-Lead Setup page reappears.
Generating HTML
You can use a tool in Salesforce that takes the guesswork out of generating HTML 
code for your web forms.
To generate a general or campaign-specific Web-to-Lead form, log in to Sales-
force and follow these steps. (If you just finished the steps in the preceding sec-
tion, click the Create Web-to-Lead Form button on the Web-to-Lead Setup page, 
and you’ll arrive here.)
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Leads ➪ Web-to-Lead.
A Web-to-Lead Setup page appears.
2.	 Click the Create Web-to-Lead Form button in the Web-to-Lead Settings 
section.
The Web-to-Lead Setup page appears.
3.	 In the Create a Web-to-Lead Form section, customize which fields you want 
to include on your Web-to-Lead form.
Click a field name in the Available Fields column, as shown in Figure 15-7, and 
then click the Add arrow button to add that field from the Available Fields 
column to the Selected Fields column. Conversely, remove fields from the 

234      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
Selected Fields column by similarly clicking a field name in the Selected Fields 
column and then clicking the Remove arrow.
Balance selecting enough fields so that they help you route the lead to the 
right person with the patience level of the prospect filling out the form.
4.	 In the Return URL field, enter a return URL (if known) and then click the 
Generate button at the bottom of the page.
The return URL corresponds to the landing page that appears after the lead 
has submitted his information online. If you don’t know whether you have one, 
or which one to use, check with your marketing manager and your web 
manager. When you click the Generate button, a page appears with HTML 
code inserted in a box, as shown in Figure 15-8.
FIGURE 15-7:  
Creating a 
Web-to-Lead 
form.
FIGURE 15-8:  
Generating basic 
HTML for your

form.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      235
If you’re creating a web form specific to a campaign, create the campaign first, 
and make sure that you selected the Active check box for that campaign 
record. By doing this, you can select the fields for Campaign and Campaign 
Member Status, which enables you to track the specific campaign.
5.	 Copy and paste the HTML code into a text file and send it to your webmaster.
6.	 Click Finished when done.
You return to the Web-to-Lead Setup page.
Viewing and testing the form
You can view and test the HTML code as an actual form by using your favorite web 
publishing application and a browser.
To view and test the form, follow these steps:
1.	 Open a new file in your favorite web publishing program.
Popular programs include FrontPage, Dreamweaver, and HomeSite. You can 
even use Notepad or TextMate.
2.	 Copy and paste the HTML code in the HTML mode.
3.	 Save the web page in HTML format (not .txt) on your computer.
4.	 Open a browser and choose File ➪ Open to open the web page.
A web form appears with the lead fields that you selected. The form is 
relatively unformatted, but your webmaster can apply code to make the form 
fit with your desired look and feel.
5.	 Fill out the basic form and click the Submit button.
If you inserted a return URL, that page appears. If not, a page appears that 
displays the information that was sent to Salesforce.
6.	 Log in to Salesforce and click the Leads tab.
7.	 Select Today’s Leads from the Views drop-down list.
The leads list for today appears. If the test lead isn’t listed, click the Refresh 
button in your browser until the test lead appears.
8.	 Click the test lead’s link under the Name column to validate the information 
from your test lead.
The lead record appears and displays the information that you submitted. 
Don’t forget to delete the test lead record after you’re comfortable that 
everything’s working!

236      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
9.	 Scroll down to the Campaign related list.
You should see a link to the campaign and the default member status. If you 
selected the Campaign Member Status field when generating the HTML code, 
you can apply a member status to all leads derived from the web form.
Manually updating member statuses
If your campaign is designed to have recipients respond by phone or email, your 
reps can manually update records as they interact with campaign members. Reps 
might have to create lead or contact records first if you didn’t build your target list 
from Salesforce. For example, if you rent a third-party list for an email campaign, 
the respondent may not yet be recorded in Salesforce.
To manually update a lead or contact responding to a campaign, follow these steps:
1.	 In the sidebar Search, search for the lead or contact.
See Chapter 3 for details on using Search.
2.	 If you can’t find the lead or contact record, create it.
See Chapter 5 for details on creating records.
3.	 Go to the specific lead or contact record page.
4.	 Click the Edit button, make any changes to the record, and click Save.
For example, you might use the fields to enter additional information supplied 
by the respondent.
5.	 Use the related lists to log any related information or future activities.
Adding a member to a campaign
In those circumstances when your target list was built externally, reps need to add 
the member to the campaign.
To manually add a member to a campaign, go to the lead or contact record and 
follow these steps:
1.	 In the Campaign History related list, click the Add to Campaign button.
A Lookup box appears.
2.	 Select the appropriate campaign view from the Search Within drop-down list 
to narrow your options, and use the search bar to find a campaign within 
that view.
The Search Results page appears.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      237
3.	 Click the campaign name.
The New Campaign Member page appears.
4.	 Select the appropriate member status from the Status drop-down list and 
click Save.
The Campaign Member detail page appears.
Updating the status of a current member
If the lead or contact is already linked to the campaign in Salesforce, you’ll want 
to update the member status when he or she responds.
To update member status manually, go to the lead or contact record and follow 
these steps:
1.	 Scroll down the page to the Campaign History related list, and click the 
Edit button next to the relevant Campaign Name.
The Campaign Member Edit page appears.
2.	 Use the Status drop-down list to change the status and then click Save.
Mass-updating campaign statuses
If leads or contacts that are part of a campaign respond in a batch, you can do a 
mass update of campaign members. For example, if you sent an email campaign 
to existing contacts and received a batch of online registrations as responses, you 
could perform a mass update. The following sections tell you two ways to update 
statuses: in a campaign or in a report. Sometimes you’ll be working directly out of 
a campaign. Other times you may be running a specific report that isn’t campaign 
related (for example, an existing “Northern California Active Customers” report), 
but you may want to update the status of people who turn up in that data set.
Mass updating all member statuses in a campaign
To mass update campaign statuses for all contacts or all leads in a campaign, log 
in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Campaigns tab and select the specific campaign whose mem-
bers’ statuses you’d like to update.
2.	 Click the Manage Members button.
A picklist appears.

238      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
3.	 Select the Edit Members – Search option.
The Manage Member page appears, with the Existing Members subtab 
selected.
4.	 Use the filter criteria, as needed, to narrow the members that you want to 
update.
You can also manually select which members to update by selecting the check 
box next to their names in the results.
5.	 Select members to be updated for this campaign, as shown in Figure 15-9.
You may select up to 200 members to update.
6.	 Click Update Status to apply the new status to your selected members.
A status bar displays the results of the operation. You may continue updating 
by selecting new views, or click the Back to Campaign: Campaign Name link 
when done.
Mass updating all member statuses in a report
To update the status of several members at once, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Reports tab and scroll down to the Campaigns Reports folder 
from the left sidebar.
2.	 Click the Campaign Call Down Report link.
A page appears, allowing you to select a specific campaign.
FIGURE 15-9:  
Updating existing 
campaign 
member statuses 
in bulk.

CHAPTER 15  Creating Campaigns with Marketing Cloud      239
3.	 Use the Lookup icon to choose a campaign and click the Run Report button.
A Campaign Call Down Report for your campaign appears.
4.	 Click the Add to Campaign button.
The Add Members Wizard opens.
5.	 Confirm the campaign in the Campaign field. Use the Lookup icon to search 
for your match.
6.	 After a campaign is selected, choose the appropriate status from the 
Member Status drop-down list.
7.	 Use the radio buttons to toggle whether you want the existing member 
statuses to be overridden by this member status.
The default is to not override existing member statuses. However, if your goal 
is to update all statuses of members in this report, choose to override the 
status.
8.	 Click Add to Campaign to continue.
Step 2 of the wizard appears with a status message of your attempt.
9.	 Verify the information and click Done.
You return to your view page.
You may also mass-update campaign statuses for contacts or leads in a campaign 
by updating the information in a .csv file first and then importing it. For exam-
ple, a trade show exhibitor may give you a file of all show attendees that you can 
cross-reference with leads that you invited. After you know which of your invitees 
actually attended, you may import this file into Salesforce. Just make sure to add 
and edit a column for Member Status (unless all records will use the default sta-
tus) and have a column for Lead or Contact ID. Then click the Manage Members 
button, click the Update Status – Import File link, and follow the guidelines to 
update the campaign history. See the “Importing new campaign members” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter, for more information.

Effectiveness with

I
f you, as a sales or marketing manager, expect to get the most out of your sales 
reps, you have to put the best tools at their fingertips. Aside from a desk, chair, 
phone, and some caffeine, reps need accurate and compelling documentation: 
sell sheets, white papers, case studies, and so on. All too often, however, sales 
documents reside in multiple places: network drives, emails, laptops, and so on.
If your reps are losing business because they can’t access the right documents, 
take advantage of Salesforce Content, which you can use to store the latest sales 
collateral in an easy-to-use, searchable library. And as long as your reps have an 
Internet connection, they can access Content, even if they’re sitting in an airport 
in Omaha, Nebraska.
What does an easily accessible library mean? If you’re a sales rep or manager, this 
means spending more time in front of your customers and less time chasing 
information. If you’re in marketing or product management, you can better con-
trol the message to customers with the confidence that sales reps are providing 
customers with the most up-to-date information available. And regardless of 
your role, you can individually store documents in your own personal folder.
Chapter 16

242      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
In this chapter, we show you how to use Salesforce Content, as well as how to 
search for documents so that your reps can put them to work to sell more 
effectively.
Understanding Salesforce Content
Salesforce Content is more than just the place where files are stored in Salesforce. 
With Content, you get a full content management system that allows you to col-
laborate, manage, and share material that’s stored anywhere on the web. Because 
it’s part of Salesforce, Content can take advantage of all the other features of 
Salesforce, such as custom fields, sharing, validation rules, and even Apex 
triggers.
For companies that need to organize a large amount of current documents, Con-
tent allows you to search document contents, notifies you when content is updated, 
and tracks user feedback. All these features help to further increase your sales and 
marketing teams’ productivity. Best of all, Content is built into Salesforce, so it’s 
waiting for you to use as soon as you’re ready.
Anyone who has ever managed a document repository can tell you that reposito-
ries need to be maintained to remain effective. If you sell a variety of products, for 
example, your product sheets need to be updated as specs change, deleted if you 
retire products, and added as you release new products.
And even though Salesforce provides easy-to-use tools to help you manage the 
workload of document control, keeping a large volume of material up to date can 
still be a daunting task.
If your company is committed to using Salesforce as the central repository for 
every department’s content, you may want to consider using Salesforce Content 
for the following reasons: increased collaboration, document tagging, deeper 
search capabilities, and notification of content changes.
Before users can interact with Salesforce Content, they have to be granted permis-
sion to access that feature. Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Manage Users ➪ Users, 
and then edit the users that you want to have maintaining your content manage-
ment system. Make sure that the Salesforce CRM Content User check box is 
selected for those users.

CHAPTER 16  Driving Sales Effectiveness with Salesforce Content      243
Creating Libraries
If you want Salesforce Content to be a highly effective sales tool for your staff, you 
have to organize your content so that people can easily find it. By using libraries, 
you can sort files into logical groupings.
We’ve seen many different and effective approaches to organizing libraries in 
Salesforce. Some companies like to separate content by product family; others 
prefer to take a vertical approach. The only right answer is the one that works for 
your company, so make sure that you spend some time deciding on a naming 
convention for your libraries. The My Libraries list on the Libraries home page will 
grow over time, so a clean and intuitive naming convention will help prevent a 
cluttered appearance.
The following is a list of common libraries that work for many organizations:
»
» Hardware
»
» Sales presentations
»
» Product data sheets
»
» Case studies
»
» Professional services
»
» Salesforce training
To create a library, you must first have the Create Libraries permission. (If you’re 
not sure you have it, you can quickly find out by seeing whether you get past Step 
1 in the following list. If you’re not able to get past Step 1, ask your administrator 
to help.) To continue, click the Libraries tab to go to the Libraries home page and 
follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New button under the My Libraries heading.
A New Library Wizard appears.
2.	 Type a name and description for the library.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save and Close.
The Library Name page appears, and you may begin contributing new content 
to your new library. You can return to your library at any time by clicking the 
Libraries tab and looking at the My Libraries list.

244      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
As you plan your content strategy, keep in mind that not all sales documents need 
to be in Salesforce Content. Some may be better suited as attachments on an 
account record; others you may not even want to have in Salesforce. As a general 
rule, files that may be reusable or have wide applicability are good for Salesforce 
Content. Documents that relate to a specific record are typically more relevant as 
attachments on record detail pages.
Adding Content
Adding content to a library — also known as contributing content — is simple. To 
upload a new document, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Libraries tab in the Content app and then click the 
Contribute button.
The Contribute Content page appears.
2.	 Click the Choose File button and browse your hard drive for the file that you 
want to upload.
Salesforce Content automatically uploads the file you select.
You can add a website link to refer people to an online video or to information 
stored on your intranet by clicking the Do You Want to Link to a Website 
Instead link.
After Salesforce Content uploads your document, it asks you to describe and 
publish your content, as shown in Figure 16-1.

3.	 Give your content a descriptive title.
Follow standard naming conventions within your company.
4.	 Select the Publish to a Shared Library radio button to store this file in a 
library.
5.	 Select the appropriate library from the drop-down menu.
6.	 If you’re not the file’s author, select another user from the Author drop-down 
menu.
7.	 (Optional) Add tags to this document if you want to identify it with words 
that may not be used in the standard library definitions.
Separate tag words with commas. Be sure to use words that people would 
commonly search for when looking for this document. We recommend that 
you only allow a subset of content users to determine what tags should be 
used, if you want to use tags as an alternate way to better filter for content. 
Otherwise, you risk having redundancy of tag words (like datasheet and data 
sheet), which reduces their effectiveness.
8.	 Click Publish when you’re done.
If you have some content that you want to share with two different groups, like sales 
and marketing, instead of creating a new library just to house their shared docu-
mentation, you can associate content with the two libraries by following these steps:
1.	 Return to the Libraries home page.
2.	 Select a document from the Top Content section.
3.	 On the Content details page, click the Edit button.
4.	 Select the Library Actions option and then click the Share with Another 
Library suboption.
5.	 Highlight additional libraries with which to share this document and click 
the Publish button.
Editing Content
After you contribute content to Content, you may need to update its details in 
Salesforce. Search for and go to your Content record from the Content tab and fol-
low these steps:
1.	 Click the Edit button.
The Edit drop-down list of options appears.

246      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
2.	 Select the Edit Content Details option.
The Edit Content window appears.
3.	 Update the title and description.
You can also upload new versions of files when changes have been made 
offline by selecting the Upload New Version option.
4.	 (Optional) Add tags to this document if you want to identify it with words 
that may not be used in the standard library definitions.
Separate words with commas. Be mindful of making the tag word too broad or 
too specific.
5.	 Click Save.
Anyone subscribed to this Content record will be notified of any new versions that 
are uploaded.
You can subscribe to a Content record by clicking the Subscribe button at the top 
of the record. You’ll get an email anytime someone updates the file, along with an 
explanation of what changed.
Finding Content
You can search for content from the search box located on the Content home page. 
Click the Content tab to go to the Content home page and then follow these steps:
1.	 In the search box, type search terms, as shown in Figure 16-2.
Optionally, check the filter check boxes to only search within a subset of all 
your Content. Filters include standard attributes like the content’s file format, 
or the author. This can also include everyone’s tag words, which is why we 
recommend an organized approach to creating tag words.
In addition to searching filenames, Salesforce Content searches the actual text 
contained in files of the following formats: rich text format (RTF); UTF-8 
encoded TXT; HTML; XML; Adobe PDF; and Microsoft Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint files.
2.	 Click the Go button.
The page reappears with a list of Content results based on your search.

CHAPTER 16  Driving Sales Effectiveness with Salesforce Content      247
3.	 Select the appropriate check boxes for the file(s) you’re looking for, and then 
click the Download button to save copies to your computer.
Alternatively, click the Title of Content record to see a preview of the file prior 
to downloading, as shown in Figure 16-3.
While your content is a work in progress, you can leverage the Files tab to combine 
the features of Chatter and Salesforce Content. You’ll be able to share with specific 
co-workers or groups, collaborate and get feedback, and upload revisions. When 
you’re ready to publish, head over to the Libraries tab and show off your work.

Learning about Files
The main purpose of Salesforce Files is to upload, store, and collaborate on files in 
the cloud. Using files, you can collaborate with other users in Salesforce by posting 
them to your Chatter feed or within records directly.
The maximum size for a file in Salesforce is 2GB, but only 100MB if you’re upload-
ing it via Salesforce1, the Salesforce mobile app.
You can upload multiple files simultaneously, directly from your local drive, into 
Salesforce’s drag-and-drop interface on the Files home page, which you can see 
in Figure 16-4. You can upload every type of file — from PowerPoint presenta-
tions to videos, as well as PDFs and Excel documents.
You can also preview, download, follow, and share the file, directly from the list 
by clicking the bottom arrow on the file of your choice.
Files in the file list can come from a few places. Files uploaded to Content will 
appear in your list, as will a file that was attached or posted within the Chatter 
feed.
Finally, you can download Salesforce Files Sync to sync your files between your 
local drive and Salesforce.
FIGURE 16-4:  
Using the Files 
home page 
interface.

CHAPTER 16  Driving Sales Effectiveness with Salesforce Content      249
Understanding Documents
Prior to the addition of Salesforce Content, you could store files in Salesforce on 
the Documents tab. Although not as robust as Content, the Documents tab is still 
available and useful in many ways. For example, you can host images referenced 
in email templates, custom apps, fields, and even Force.com sites on the Docu-
ments tab. These files typically don’t change often and definitely don’t need to be 
collaborated on, so you can continue to store them by clicking the Documents tab.
You can also think of the Documents tab as a place where system administrators 
house files. However, if you need the ability to preview files, collaborate on them 
with Chatter, or store larger files, those files belong in Salesforce Content.
Creating folders in the Document Library
To create a document folder, you must first have the Manage Public Documents 
permission. (If you’re not sure you have it, you can quickly find out by seeing 
whether you get past Step 1 in the following list. If you’re not able to get past Step 
1, ask your administrator to help.) To continue, go to the Documents tab and fol-
low these steps:
1.	 Click the Create New Folder link under the Document Folders heading.
A New Document Folder page appears.
2.	 Type a name for the folder in the Document Folder field.
3.	 Use the Public Folder Access drop-down list to select the access rights.
4.	 Click the radio buttons to select who should have access to the folder.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Folder Name Documents page appears, and you may begin adding new 
documents to your new folder.
Adding documents
Before reps can begin using documents in Salesforce, you or someone in your 
company must first add the documents to the Document Library.
When uploading documents, the file size limit on any individual file is 5MB. For 
some companies, this may be the average size of a PowerPoint presentation or a 
PDF file with graphics, so plan accordingly.

250      PART 5  Generating Demand with Marketing Cloud
To add a document and upload its file, log in to Salesforce and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the plus sign at the top to the right of your tabs and then select 
Documents.
An Upload New Document page appears.
2.	 Type a name for the file in the Document Name field.
If you want the document name to be an exact match of the filename, leave 
this field blank. After you select the file, the filename automatically populates 
the empty Document Name field.
3.	 Select the For Internal Use Only check box only if you want this document to 
be confidential.
If you select this check box, you don’t alter access to the document, but you 
flag your end-users not to send the file outside the company.
4.	 Select the Externally Available Image check box only if you’re uploading an 
image that you’ll be sending in HTML email templates to people who should 
view it without having to log in to Salesforce to see it.
For example, logos or letterhead footers should have this box selected.
5.	 Use the Folder drop-down list to select a folder.
If you haven’t yet created the appropriate folder, or you don’t have read-write 
access to the correct folder, you can first store the file in the My Personal 
Documents folder and refile the document later.
6.	 In the Description field, type a brief description of the document.
7.	 In the Keywords field, type keywords that will help your end-users find the 
document.
Salesforce provides a Find Documents search tool on the Documents home 
page, so you should select keywords that you think your users will enter.
For example, if you’re adding a case study, you might enter keywords that 
include relevant products, customer names, challenges, and so on that sales 
reps could use for cross-referencing.
8.	 Under the Select the File step, the Enter the Path radio button is selected by 
default, so you just need to click the Browse button to select the desired file.
A Choose File dialog box appears.
9.	 Select a file from the folders on your computer and click Open.
The dialog box closes, and the document path is entered in the File to Upload 
field.

CHAPTER 16  Driving Sales Effectiveness with Salesforce Content      251
10.	When you’re done, click Save.
When the upload is completed, the document record page reappears in 
Saved mode with information on the document and a link to view the 
­document.
Using documents
After you create documents in Salesforce, you can use them in various ways in the 
course of your selling. You can search for documents from the Documents home 
page or browse through your document folders. You can leverage an image that was 
uploaded from the Documents tab, in Email Templates. If you’re an administrator, 
you can also customize the logo in the upper-left corner of Salesforce with an 
uploaded image, as long as it’s at most 20KB and 300 pixels wide by 55 pixels high.
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN DOCUMENTS, 
CONTENT, AND FILES
If you’re not sure where to store a file, that’s okay. Here’s a simple recap: Use the 
Documents tab to store images used in Email Templates and not to attach to records. 
Use the Files tab for collaborating on works in progress. Use Salesforce Content for pub-
lishing approved material throughout the business and delivering them externally. Use 
attachments for attaching files to records.

f you’re just beginning your implementation, Salesforce comes preconfigured 
with a number of common fields in simple layouts for each of the tabs. You 
could buy your licenses, log in, and without any customization, start using it to 
track your customers. So, why are no two instances of Salesforce likely to be 
identical?
The answer is a key ingredient to your success: The more Salesforce is customized 
to your business, the more likely your company will use it effectively and produc-
tively . . . as long as you lay a strong foundation (and using this book will help)!
If you’re an administrator or a user with permission to customize Salesforce, you 
have a universe of tools to design Salesforce to fit the way you do business. And you 
don’t need to be a technical wizard to make these changes. With common sense, 
patience, and a little help from this book, you can customize Salesforce on your 
own in a way that will allow Salesforce to scale as your business matures. If you’re 
an end-user, you, too, have some basic customization tools you can use to more 
efficiently navigate Salesforce, and see the records that matter the most to you.
Chapter 17

256      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
You may hear the phrase Force.com used when talking about Salesforce’s custom-
ization capabilities. That’s the umbrella term used to describe everything under 
the Setup link, where all the many Salesforce customization features are located. 
It’s described as the foundational platform that makes Salesforce and its many 
custom applications possible.
We could write another book if we tried to address each feature. In this chapter, 
we show you how to perform all the core customization options, including creat-
ing fields and rearranging layouts. We discuss certain customizations that end-
users should be familiar with. Then, for companies that have Enterprise or 
Unlimited Edition and have complex needs, we show you how to develop custom 
page layouts, build record types that link to custom profiles, and use the Process 
Builder to map your business process right into Salesforce.
Discovering the Power of Customization
All your customization tools are conveniently accessible from the Customize menu 
located under the Build heading of Setup in Salesforce. Navigating the Customize 
menu is simple when you understand some basics. If you have administrative 
permissions, log in to Salesforce and do this now:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize.
The Customize page of Setup appears, and the sidebar expands to display 
headings for the various objects that can be customized (see Figure 17-1). 
Under the Customize heading on the sidebar, you see a few select headings for 
other areas of Salesforce (such as Call Center and Self-Service), which can also 
be customized.
2.	 Toggle the arrow buttons or headings that correspond to the major tabs, 
such as Accounts, Contacts, and Leads.
The sidebar expands with the different customization features available under 
each heading. These are all the things you can do when customizing a standard 
tab. Notice that although certain headings have more features, most of the 
headings have links to common customization features, such as Fields, Page 
Layouts, Search Layouts, Buttons and Links, and in certain editions, Record 
Types and Processes.
3.	 Click the Fields link under a tab-related heading (like Accounts) on the 
sidebar.
A Fields page appears based on the selected tab heading. This easy and 
consistent navigation will help you through the customization.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      257
If you hadn’t noticed, the tab names listed under the Customize header aren’t in 
alphabetical order. The list used to be much shorter back in Salesforce’s infancy. 
Over time, more features and tabs (also known as objects) were created. You don’t 
have to keep scrolling to find where a certain object header is listed. Just use the 
Quick Find/Search bar in the upper left of the left sidebar (see Figure 17-2). When 
you type a tab name or feature setting name, links containing those words appear.

258      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Breaking down basic elements
When diving into customization, keep in mind these five basic elements of 
Salesforce:
»
» Records: Records are the high-level data elements that capture information 
that’s determined by its corresponding object (such as accounts, contacts, and 
opportunities) that are stored in the Salesforce database. Think of records like 
the skin that resides on top of your skeleton, both of which are objects. Each 
tab corresponds to a type of record. Records consist of fields that hold 
information specific to that particular record. If you think of the Salesforce 
database as a filing cabinet holding all your company’s information, a record is 
like a type of form that you house in your filing cabinet. Alternatively, think of 
a driver’s license as a record. There are fields and information on it that, 
altogether, are used to describe you.
»
» Page Layouts: Page Layouts allow you to control how a page is displayed to 
users. Different users (like those in marketing and sales) may need to see 
some common fields on a Contact record, while also focusing on other fields 
relevant to just their departments. Different page layouts help different teams 
see fields that are most relevant to them, which helps with adoption and 
increased usage of your CRM system.
»
» Search Layouts: This feature allows you to control how search results are 
displayed to users. It corresponds to the organization of columns that are 
displayed on a Search Results page, lookup dialog page, or record home page 
in Salesforce.
»
» Processes: This is an option for some objects, allowing you to build various 
sales, marketing, and service processes in Salesforce that you want your reps 
to follow.
»
» Record Types: Record Types allow you to offer certain business processes 
and subsets of drop-down lists to users based on their profiles. Not to be 
confused with a type of record (such as an account or contact), a record type, 
when used with page layouts and profiles, can make only some of the 
drop-down list values available to users within a profile. For example, an 
enterprise sales rep with a longer sales cycle may need to track more opportu-
nity stages of her sales cycle, compared to a general business rep whose 
high-volume transactions only require tracking of a few opportunity stages.
Customizing for relevance
Prior to customizing Salesforce, your CRM project team should conduct a series of 
business process reviews with functional representatives or stakeholders of the 

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      259
teams that will be using Salesforce. In those meetings, not only should you map 
out current and desired processes, but you should also ask sets of leading ques-
tions that will impact the design of fields, records, objects, layouts, and more. Key 
questions should include
»
» How do you define your customer?
»
» What information do you want to collect on a contact?
»
» Whom do you expect to fill out this information? Is that realistic?
»
» How do you know that you have a qualified lead?
»
» What do you want to know about an opportunity?
Use the answers to construct a list of standard and custom fields per object that 
you believe should be in Salesforce. That spreadsheet should include columns for 
field name, field type, field values, justification, and so on, and you should review 
it with your project team prior to customization.
When customizing, keep it simple at the beginning. Don’t add or keep a field 
unless you ultimately believe that you or someone else will use it. You can always 
build additional fields in the future, especially if you build momentum based on 
early user adoption success.
When you create custom fields, fill in the Help and Description fields for them, 
too. This is often overlooked and results in future generations of employees often 
scratching their heads as to a field’s usefulness. Custom fields get created over 
time and names sound familiar (but may be obvious in their differences when you 
create them), and this tacit knowledge rarely gets passed on. Consider the Help 
text as your future self, training the next new sales rep, marketing manager, ser-
vice agent, and so on. Use the Description field to give a little more background to 
which group requested this field and to what they were trying to report with this 
data.
Building and Editing Fields
When it comes to customizing Salesforce fields, one word describes the experience: 
easy. The hard part is confirming why you want it, who will be realistically filling 
out the information that you want to capture, and whether this information will be 
easily reportable when hundreds or thousands of records have this data. The more 

260      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
relevant you make the record fields to your actual business, the better the user 
adoption batting average and the higher the likelihood of hitting a home run.
Adding fields
All editions of Salesforce allow you to add fields, but some versions allow you to 
add significantly more fields than others. For example, if you have Group Edition, 
you can add 100 custom fields per object; with Enterprise Edition, you can create 
up to 500 per object.
To add a field, click the Setup link in the upper-right corner of Salesforce and fol-
low these steps:
1.	 Click any tab-related heading under the Customize heading on 
the sidebar.
The options under the selected heading appear.
2.	 Click the Fields link under the heading.
The Fields page for the tab appears, displaying a list of standard fields at the 
top and a list of custom fields and relationships at the bottom.
3.	 Click New in the Custom Fields & Relationships related list.
Step 1 of the New Custom Field Wizard appears. Data types with descriptions 
of each of them appear in a list, as shown in Figure 17-3.
FIGURE 17-3:  
Choosing a new 
contact custom 
field’s data type.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      261
4.	 Select a radio button matching the type of field that you want to create and 
then click Next.
Step 2 of the wizard appears, asking you to enter details about the field you 
want to create. These two fields are required:
•	 A field label is what’s displayed on page layouts, in reports, and to end-
users’ eyes (for example, “Reimbursement Date”).
•	 A field name may be the exact same as a field label but must use an 
underscore (_) as a substitute for a space character. Field names are used 
as an internal reference by Salesforce and are key for integration (for 
example, “Reimbursement_Date”).
5.	 Enter the details and click Next.
Step 3 of the wizard appears. The details page varies based on the field type 
you selected. For example, the settings for a Text Area field are different than 
for a Currency field.
If your company’s edition is not Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, click Save and 
you’re done. If you prefer, click Save & New to immediately save this custom 
field and begin creating another one.
6.	 For Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, use the check boxes to select the 
field-level security access and edit rights per profile and then click Next.
Step 4 of the wizard appears.
7.	 For Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, use the check boxes to select the page 
layouts that should include this field and then click Save.
The Fields page for the selected record reappears.
Viewing and updating fields
On an ongoing basis, situations come up in which you may need to update the 
properties of a field. For example, management changes or adds statuses, nomen-
clature changes so that field labels need to change, and so on.
To view and update your fields, choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Customize. Then click the 
Fields link under a tab heading under the Customize heading on the sidebar. The 
Fields page for the selected tab appears, displaying lists of standard and custom 
fields. From this page, you can do the following:
»
» Update a field. Click the Edit link to the left of whichever field you want 
to modify.

262      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
»
» Change the field type on a field. Click the Edit link for that field, and then 
click the Change Field Type button at the top of the Edit page. Step 1 of the 
wizard appears, and you can follow the steps in the preceding section, starting 
with Step 4.
If data already exists in a field and you want to change its data type, you risk 
losing that data. Also, not all data types can be converted into a different data 
type. For more details, click the Help link in the upper-right corner of any 
Salesforce page and type changing custom field types in the search bar.
»
» View the field and its properties. Click a link in the Field Label column.
»
» Delete a custom field. Click the Del link to the left of the field, next to the Edit 
link.
»
» Add values to a drop-down list. Click the Field Name link in the Label 
column, and then click the New button in the Picklist Values related list, as 
shown in Figure 17-4.
»
» Replace values in a drop-down list. Click the Replace link next to a field.  
A Find and Replace Picklist page appears. Make sure to add the new value 
before trying to replace.
The Replace feature is really helpful when you have existing records with old 
values that need to be switched to new values. Take the Lead Status field, for 
example: You could use the Replace feature to update leads formerly marked 
as Unresponsive and replace them all instantly with a new value called 
Nurture. However, check to confirm that this doesn’t impact any historical 
analysis that other teams rely on.
»
» Reorder values in a drop-down list. Click the field name link in the Label 
column, and then click the Reorder button in the Picklist Values list.
Replicating your key standard processes
On certain standard records in Salesforce, you use a standard drop-down list to 
map your business processes.
FIGURE 17-4:  
Adding a new 
picklist value to a 
drop-down list.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      263
You’ll probably want to put some careful thought into handling each type of 
record. To define your standard business processes, do the following:
1.	 Expand the Customize menu until you see the Fields links for various 
records (under the Activities heading, refer to the Task Fields link).
2.	 Click a Fields link under one of the records mentioned in Step 1.
The Fields page appears with Standard Fields and Custom Fields & 
Relationships related lists.
3.	 Depending on the record you chose, look in the Standard Fields related 
list and then click the Status or Stage link to modify the corresponding 
­processes.
In each circumstance, a field page appears with a Picklist Values related list, 
listing all the values within the process.
4.	 In the Picklist Values related list, adjust your process, as necessary.
See the preceding section for details on updating picklist fields.
Understanding custom formula fields
A custom formula field is a type of custom field that automatically calculates its 
values based on the content of other values or fields. For example, if you charge 
your customers a shipping-and-handling fee based on the total quantity of a 
product listed in an opportunity, create a custom formula field called S&H that 
multiplies your total quantity amount with a predefined value.
To create a custom formula field, first define the task at hand. What is it you want 
to calculate? Then follow up to Step 3 of the numbered list in the “Adding fields” 
section, earlier in this chapter, and choose to add a Formula field. Then continue 
with these steps:
1.	 At Step 2 of the New Custom Field Wizard, provide a field label and 
field name.
2.	 Use the radio buttons to select the format that your returned value will take 
and then click Next.
Depending on your selection, Salesforce may ask you how many decimal 
places you want your returned value to display.

264      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
3.	 Type your formula in Step 3 (as shown in Figure 17-5).
Salesforce displays two subtabs — Simple Formula and Advanced Formula — 
to help you with creating your formula, and adding your formula for 
Salesforce to process:
•	 Simple Formula: Reveals a subset of merge fields to add to your formula, 
along with standard math operators
•	 Advanced Formula: Reveals all possible merge fields for your record, 
provides more operators, and shows you a set of Excel-like function 
categories that you can use to plug into your formula
To use either, simply move your mouse over the tab that you want to use and 
click it. The body of that tab appears.
4.	 Click Check Syntax when complete to make sure that your formula is up to 
snuff; then click Next.
If you get an error message, go back and check your formula. Salesforce’s error 
messages will tell you if it can’t find the fields you’re referencing, if you used an 
incorrect parameter, and so on.
5.	 In Step 4, confirm field-level security for your new field and then click Next.
Because it derives its content automatically, the field will be a read-only field. 
You just have to confirm who can see it.
6.	 In Step 5, confirm which page layout you want to add this new field to; click 
Save when finished.
The Fields page for the record reappears.
You don’t have to be a math or Excel whiz to benefit from custom formula fields, 
although those skills sure can help you master it faster. If you’re like the rest of us 
and you’d rather not even figure out the tip on your dinner tab, make sure that you 
go to the Help section from the upper right of any page in Salesforce and search 
FIGURE 17-5:  
Creating a 
custom formula.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      265
for examples of advanced formula fields for a ton of suggestions on how your orga-
nization can benefit from prebuilt formulas grouped by specific topics.
Customizing List Views
If you want special lists for the way that you manage, let’s say, your accounts, 
build custom list views. For example, if you’re a new business sales rep who 
focuses solely on California manufacturing companies and always researches the 
prospect’s website before calling, creating a custom view can help you be more 
effective because you can build your list of target accounts, define columns, and 
use that view over and over again.
To build a list view from scratch, using the Accounts object as an example, follow 
these simple steps:
1.	 On the Accounts home page, to the right of the View drop-down list, click 
the Create New View link.
The Create New View page appears.
2.	 Name the list view in the View Name field.
For our fictitious California manufacturing example, you might call the view 
California Manufacturing Prospects.
3.	 Select the appropriate radio button to filter your results quickly by owner.
4.	 (Optional) Filter by additional fields.
A basic criteria query is made up of three elements:
•	 Field: Select a field on which to search. One example is the Type field.
•	 Operator: Select an operator for your filter. That sounds complicated, but 
it’s easier than you might think. Taking our example, you’d select Equals 
from the drop-down list.
•	 Value: In the third field, type the value that you want in the filter. For our 
example, you’d type Prospect because, for this example, you go after only 
new business.
5.	 Select the columns that you want to be displayed.
Although Salesforce’s preset views take common fields, such as Phone and 
Billing State/Province, you can display any of the account fields that you’re 
permitted to see on your custom list page. In our example, you’d add another 
column for the Website field.

266      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
6.	 Decide whether you want others to see your custom view.
This choice might not be available to you. If it is, select the appropriate option, 
depending on whether you want to share your view with others. If you choose 
to make it visible to certain groups of users, you can search for and select 
groups and roles of users who will see the view.
7.	 When you’re done, click Save.
A new list view appears based on your custom criteria. If you don’t get all the 
results you anticipated, you might want to recheck and refine the search crite-
ria. For example, if your company has a habit of using postal abbreviations (NY) 
or the full spelling for the State field (New York), this habit impacts results.
By default, each filtering criteria for your list view is joined together with AND 
parameters. If you want to get fancy with your search criteria, click the Add Filter 
Logic link to use a combination of AND and OR filters.
Working with Records
After you add records into Salesforce, you can make changes to them to reflect the 
natural evolution of your business and its processes. For example, opportunities 
may progress, stall, or fade away. Territories change, salespeople leave, or more 
are brought in. In the following sections, we cover common practices you perform 
on records: reassigning, cloning, and editing them. We also explain what related 
lists are, and why they’re key to your holistic view of your customer.
Reassigning record ownership
You might find that after you set up a record in Salesforce (let’s use an opportu-
nity record in this case), you need to give that record to the right person. In sales 
organizations, management may have decided to reshuffle sales territories 
(again). Or your sales teams might be set up in a hunter/farmer configuration, in 
which you reassign closed opportunities from new business reps to account man-
agers after a certain time has passed.
If you want to reassign a record, open the detail page for that page. In this exam-
ple, we use an Opportunity record. Follow these steps:
1.	 To the right of the Opportunity Owner field, click Change.
The Ownership Edit page appears, as shown in Figure 17-6.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      267
2.	 Select the user to whom you’re assigning the opportunity.
3.	 (Optional) Select the Send Notification Email check box.
The recipient gets notified of the reassignment via email.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The opportunity record reappears. The Opportunity Owner field has changed 
to the assigned user.
Cloning records
If you commonly create records that are similar to each other, use the cloning 
feature to reduce unnecessary retyping. For example, if you’re an account man-
ager who creates work order opportunities for additional purchases from the same 
customer, you might want to clone an existing record and change the details.
To clone a record (we’ll use an opportunity in our example), go to the record that 
you want to clone and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Clone button at the top of the record.
A new Opportunity Edit page appears, prefilled with all the data from the 
previous record.
2.	 Modify the fields as necessary.
Pay close attention to content in required fields such as Close Date, Stage, and 
Opportunity Name because the information prefilled in those fields might be 
incorrect for the new opportunity. Review data in other fields to ensure that 
the information is applicable to this new opportunity.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
An Opportunity detail page for your cloned opportunity appears.
FIGURE 17-6:  
Reassigning an 
opportunity.

268      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Updating records
In the course of working with your records, you inevitably collect information that 
you want to save directly in that record. To update your record (in this case, we’ll 
use the opportunity as an example), do the following:
1.	 Click the Edit button on the opportunity.
You can also hover your mouse over the specific field on that record that you 
want to edit. If a pencil icon appears to the right of the field, double-click the 
field to edit it. (If you see a padlock icon instead, that means the field is not 
editable, on purpose. Move along and pick another field to update.)
To quickly access and edit related records, scroll down to the related list 
section of the browser page, and click Edit to the left of the desired related 
record. The Edit page for that record appears.
2.	 Update the fields, as necessary, paying particular attention to keeping fields 
such as Amount, Close Date, and Stage up to date.
Nine times out of ten, you’ll be editing fields that play a key role in your 
company’s reports. By keeping your information up to date, you and other 
users can leverage good data when running their analyses.
3.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The opportunity reappears in Saved mode. The fields that you edited are 
changed.
For the opportunity record, you can keep track of certain critical updates to your 
record by using the Stage History related list. Anytime you or one of your team 
members who has read-write access to your record modifies the Stage field, you 
can quickly scan this at the bottom of the opportunity record page to see who 
modified the record and when. Other types of objects can also track the history of 
changes made to specific fields that you determine. From the Help section, search 
for set history tracking for more information.
Using related lists
Related lists. Say it three times so you don’t forget the term. By designing the page 
with related lists, Salesforce enables you to gain 360-degree customer visibility 
and ensure that more detailed information is only a click away. For example, if 
you open an Account detail page for one of your major customers and scroll down 
below the record fields, you can see multiple contacts, activities, opportunities, 
cases, and so on listed as links from organized related lists. From these related 
lists, you can quickly open or edit the specific related list record. And if you don’t 
see these links, you have work to do.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      269
Creating Dependent Picklists
If you find your picklist values building up and affecting the user’s experience, 
you should consider using dependent picklists to show values in one list based on 
what’s selected in another list. For example, you could create a custom picklist 
field called Reason for your opportunity record and offer two sets of reasons, 
depending on whether the opportunity was won or lost.
Creating these lists is a two-step process. In our example below, we will use a 
standard field, “Stage” on the Opportunity, and the custom field mentioned 
above, “Reason”:
1.	 Identify which two fields you want to use when building your depen-
dent picklist.
Think about which fields will dictate the drop-down list for what other fields. 
The field that determines another field’s values is the controlling field and can 
be a standard or custom picklist or a check box. The field that’s dependent on 
the controlling field to determine its displayed values is the dependent field. We 
cover this step in the “Adding fields” section, earlier in this chapter.
2.	 Tell Salesforce about these two fields and their roles in this relationship.
That’s what we cover in this section.
To define field dependencies, follow these steps:
1.	 Expand the Customize menu until you see the Fields links under the 
appropriate tab (under the Activities heading, refer to Activity 
Custom Fields).
The Fields page appears.
2.	 Click Field Dependencies in the Custom Fields & Relationships related list.
The Field Dependencies page for your record appears.
3.	 Click New.
The New Field Dependency page appears in Edit mode.
4.	 Select your controlling and dependent fields; then click Continue to deter-
mine what gets filtered.
A field can be dependent on just one controlling field. However, that depen-
dent field may also act as a controlling field to daisy-chain together several 
dependencies.

270      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
5.	 At the Edit Field Dependency page, select which dependent list items are 
visible for which controlling field values, and then click Include Values.
If your controlling field has several items in its drop-down list, you might have 
to click the Next link to see additional columns. You can also select multiple 
values at once by Shift-clicking to select a range of adjacent cells or Ctrl-clicking 
to select cells that aren’t adjacent.
6.	 (Optional) Click the Preview button to see a pop-up window demo your 
dependent picklist.
7.	 Click Save.
The Field Dependencies page returns with your new dependent picklist listed.
Record types allow certain people to see the same subset of picklist values every 
time. Dependent picklists allow a user to see different subsets of picklist values 
based on what they choose in the controlling field.
Customizing Page and Search Layouts
Wouldn’t it be great if you could take the fields on a record and rearrange them 
like jigsaw puzzle pieces on a page until they fit just right? Sounds too good to be 
true, but with Salesforce, you can do just that and more.
Use page layouts to modify the position of fields, custom links, and related lists on 
Record detail pages and Edit pages. While you’re modifying a page layout, you can 
also edit field properties to determine which fields should be required or 
read-only.
And with Enterprise and Unlimited editions, you can create multiple page layouts 
and assign them to profiles, record types, or a combination of both. By doing this, 
you can ensure that different users are viewing just the right information to do 
their jobs.
Modifying a page layout
If you have permission to customize Salesforce, you can modify page layouts at 
any time. We typically recommend that you create some or the majority of your 
proposed custom fields first before rearranging them on the layout.
To edit a page layout, click the Setup link in the upper-right corner of any Sales-
force page and follow these steps:

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      271
1.	 Click any tab heading under the Customize heading on the sidebar.
The selected heading expands with links to customization options.
2.	 Click the Page Layouts link under the tab heading.
The Page Layout page for the selected tab appears.
3.	 Click the Edit link next to a page layout that you want to modify.
A Page Layout editor appears, with the editor at the top and a sample layout 
below it (see Figure 17-7).
4.	 Choose from the following options to edit the layout using the nifty 
drag-and-drop user interface:
•	 Arrange fields, buttons, custom links, related lists, and more. By default, you 
see fields that go into the detail section for that record. Select other 
options to edit from the left sidebar of the layout editor. If you have a lot of 
fields to wade through, use the Quick Find search bar in the layout editor 
to quickly locate a field. If it’s grayed out, it means that it’s already on the 
layout — clicking it will take you to it. If the field isn’t grayed out, you can 
then click and drag it from the main body of the layout editor to desired 
locations on the sample layout.
•	 Rearrange existing fields. Hover over them in the sample layout to highlight 
them, and then click and drag them to the updated destination on the 
layout. A dark bar shows you where the field will “land” after you drop it.
FIGURE 17-7:  
Viewing the Page 
Layout editor.

272      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
•	 Modify field properties. Hover over a field on the sample layout, and then 
click the wrench icon to the right of the field. In the pop-up window that 
appears, use the check boxes to modify Read Only and Required settings 
and then click OK.
•	 Organize the record with sections. Hover over a section header and click its 
wrench icon. Alternatively, click the + Section button in the main body of 
the layout editor and drag it to where you want it to appear in the sample 
layout. In the pop-up window that appears, type a name for the section, 
use the drop-down lists to adjust basic settings (such as columns), and 
then click OK.
For example, on an account page layout, you might want to build a section 
named Strategic Account Planning to organize fields for account planning. 
When you click OK, the window closes.
5.	 To preview the layout, click the Preview As button in the layout editor.
Select which user perspective you want to view. A window appears with sample 
data displayed in the layout as it’s currently modified. In the preview window 
that opens, review the layout and click Close.
6.	 When you’re satisfied with your layout changes, click Save in the layout 
editor.
The Page Layout page for your selected record reappears.
Assigning layouts to profiles
After you create custom page layouts, you can assign your layouts to profiles. By 
doing this, users will view detail pages based on their profile and associated page 
layout.
To assign layouts to profiles, click the Setup link in the upper-right corner of any 
Salesforce page and follow these steps:
1.	 Click any tab heading under the Customize heading on the sidebar.
The selected heading expands with a menu of options.
2.	 Click the Page Layouts link under the tab heading.
The Page Layouts page for the selected tab appears.
3.	 Click the Page Layout Assignment button at the top of the Page Layouts list.
A Page Layout Assignment page appears with a list of current assignments.
4.	 Click the Edit Assignment button.
The page reappears in Edit mode.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      273
5.	 In the Page Layout column, highlight one or multiple cells by clicking the 
links.
Ctrl+click or Shift+click to select multiple cells.
6.	 From the Page Layout to Use drop-down list, choose the page layout that you 
want to assign to the selected profiles.
7.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Page Layout Assignment page reappears, displaying your changes.
Changing search layouts
If you’ve ever seen some search results and wished that they showed a few more 
column headers, you’re in for a treat. Search layouts allow you to determine which 
standard or custom fields appear as headers in multiple types of search features 
for your organization:
»
» Search results from the sidebar or advanced search
»
» Lookup dialog boxes that pop up a window when you click the Lookup 
magnifying glass next to a field
»
» Lookup phone dialog boxes that pop up a window when you click the 
magnifying glass icon on a SoftPhone dial pad, which then allows you to make 
calls from your computer
»
» Recent Records lists that appear on a tab’s home page
»
» Search results filter fields for narrowing searches
Additionally, you can choose to show or hide standard and custom buttons in a list 
view page.
To change a search layout, follow these steps:
1.	 Click any tab heading under the Customize heading on the sidebar.
The selected heading expands with a menu of options.
2.	 Click the Search Layouts link under the tab heading.
The Search Layouts Page for the selected tab appears.
3.	 Click the Edit link next to any of the search features you’d like to change.
The Edit Search Layout page for the chosen search feature appears.

274      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
4.	 Move fields from the Available Fields column to the Selected Fields column 
using the Add and Remove arrows, as needed. Select or clear any standard or 
custom buttons that you’d like to have on your list view.
5.	 Click Save when finished.
The Search Layouts page for the selected tab reappears.
Using Record Types
If you’re using Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, you can use record types to make 
subsets of drop-down lists, which are available to specific sets of users. For exam-
ple, if you have two sales teams — say, one that sells into healthcare services and 
another that sells into retail verticals — both teams might share common picklist 
fields on an account record but with very different values. With record types, you 
can customize accounts so that the same Industry field displays retail sectors for 
one group and healthcare services verticals for the other. When you provide record 
types to your users, the big benefit is that you make common drop-down lists 
easier to fill out and more relevant.
You can build record types to support all the major records in Salesforce, including 
leads, accounts, opportunities, and so on. Before users can take advantage of the 
record type feature, though, you need to first create the record types and then 
assign them to profiles. The good news is that with the Salesforce Record Type 
Wizard, you can perform both actions in a series of guided steps.
Before creating your record types, check that you first added all values to a master 
picklist field (drop-down list). (See the section “Viewing and updating fields,” 
earlier in this chapter, for details on editing drop-down lists.)
To create a record type, click the Setup link in the upper-right corner of any Sales-
force page and follow these steps:
1.	 Click any tab heading under the Customize heading on the sidebar.
The selected tab heading expands.
2.	 Click the Record Types link under the tab heading.
The Record Type page for the selected tab appears.
3.	 Click the New button.
Step 1 of the New Record Type Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 17-8.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      275
4.	 Complete the fields at the top of the page.
Most are obvious, but here are three important pointers:
•	 Existing Record Type: Choose from this drop-down list to clone from another 
record type. The new record type will inherit all the drop-down list values 
from the existing record type. You can then modify it later.
If you choose not to clone, the record type automatically includes the 
master drop-down list values for both custom and standard fields. That’s 
okay — you can edit the drop-down lists later.
•	 Business process: On a lead, opportunity, case, or solution record type, 
select the business process from the drop-down list. See the preceding 
section for details.
•	 Active: Select this check box if you want to make the record type active.
5.	 Select the check boxes in the table to make the new record type available to 
different profiles.
If you ever need to modify the assignment of record types to profiles, you can 
do this from the Record Type Settings section of a profile page. Simply scroll 
down the profile page until you see the Record Type Settings section, click the 
Edit link next to a record type, and follow the easy steps on the page that 
appears. (See Chapter 19 for details on updating profile settings.)
6.	 When you’re done, click Next.
Step 2 of the wizard appears.
FIGURE 17-8:  
Creating a new 
record type.

276      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
7.	Use the drop-down lists to select the page layout that different profiles will 
see for records of this record type.
You can apply one layout to all profiles or assign different layouts to different 
profiles.
8.	When you’re done, click Save.
The new Record Type page appears with a section called Picklists Available for 
Editing, which list the drop-down lists on the record type.
9.	Click the Edit link next to a picklist to modify the values.
A Record Type Edit page appears.
10.	Highlight values in the Available Values or Selected Values list box and use 
the arrow buttons to build the Selected Values list as you want it.
11.	Select a value from the Default drop-down list, if necessary, and then click 
Save.
The Record Type page reappears.
If a user will need to make use of multiple record types, remember to add the 
Record Type field manually to a page layout. For example, if a sales rep sells both 
generators and engines (and opportunity record types exist for both), providing 
the Record Type field on a layout allows the rep to switch a generator opportunity 
to an engine opportunity, if needed. See the section “Customizing Page and Search 
Layouts,” earlier in this chapter, for details.
Managing Workflow and Approvals
How many times have you lost or delayed business because someone forgot to do 
something in your sales process? With the workflow feature in Salesforce, you can 
create a rule and associate it to emails, tasks, and alerts that can be assigned to 
different users. You can also update the value of a field on a record if a certain rule 
occurs. Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition users can use workflow to auto-
mate certain standard processes to make sure that important balls don’t get 
dropped. For example, if your sales reps create opportunities that sometimes 
require special pricing paperwork, you can use a workflow rule to automatically 
send email alerts and tasks to finance and sales managers, and you can set these 
alerts and tasks to go out a set number of hours later.
Before creating a workflow process, take a moment to understand some basic 
workflow concepts:

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      277
»
» Workflow rules are the criteria you set that, when triggered, tell Salesforce to 
assign tasks or send emails.
»
» Workflow field updates specify what field is updated on an object when a 
workflow rule is triggered.
»
» Workflow tasks are the tasks that a workflow rule assigns to users when 
triggered.
»
» Workflow alerts are the email templates that a workflow rule sends to 
specific recipients. (Before creating a workflow alert, make sure that you’ve 
created the email template that you’ll be sending.)
»
» Workflow tasks and alerts may be reused for different workflow rules.
To create a workflow process, first make sure that you can fill in the blanks in this 
sentence: When X happens, I want A, B, and C to happen. X is your workflow rule, and 
A, B, and C are the field updates, tasks, and email alerts. Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ 
Create ➪ Workflow & Approvals to begin.
Creating workflow rules
To create a workflow rule, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Workflow Rules link under the Workflow & Approvals heading 
on the sidebar.
If this is your first time, the Understanding Workflow page appears.
2.	 Click Continue after reading the overview.
The All Workflow Rules page appears.
3.	 Click the New Rule button to create a new rule.
Step 1 of the Workflow Rule Wizard appears for your new rule.
4.	 Select the type of object to which the workflow rule should apply.
5.	 Click Next to continue.
Step 2 of the Workflow Rule Wizard appears. To configure your rule, do the 
following steps:
a.	 Enter a Rule Name and optional description.
b.	 Decide when the rule will be evaluated by Salesforce. The options are only 
when a new record is created, when the record is created or it’s been edited 
and didn’t previously meet the triggering criteria (listed as anytime the field 
is edited to subsequently meet criteria), or every time the record is created 
or edited.

278      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
c.	 Use the rule criteria to determine what conditions must be met to trigger the 
rule. Use the Advanced Options for more complex AND/OR scenarios.
6.	 Click Save & Next.
The Specify Workflow Actions screen appears.
7.	 Identify what happens when the workflow criteria is met.
An action can happen immediately, or it can happen a specific number of 
hours or days before or after certain criteria are met. You can create new 
actions (see the following section for more information) or use existing ones 
associated with immediate or time-based workflow triggers.
APPROVAL PROCESSES
Approval processes are a more advanced type of workflow that notify users when an 
action is triggered, require the user to review and then approve or reject the action, and 
then set off additional actions. For example, an expense report may follow one route of 
approvals if it’s for $250 or less and another process if it’s for an amount more than 
$10,000. Before setting forth with activating this feature for a certain record, make sure 
that you think through the following questions:
•	 Do all records of this type absolutely require approval, or just certain ones?
•	 Who’s allowed to submit records for approval?
•	 Should a record be automatically approved or rejected in certain circumstances?
•	 Should any actions take place on the record as it moves through the approval 
chain?
•	 Who should be able to edit records that are in the process of being approved?
•	 Who should approve or reject items? Can that person delegate that privilege to 
someone else, in his or her absence?
•	 What should happen when a record has received all necessary approvals?
•	 What should happen when a record has been rejected?
Although it may be nice to automatically shepherd an approval process through to the 
right people, make sure that your business process is fairly rock solid. For example, are 
the bottlenecks you face today in your approval process going to disappear, be reduced, 
or remain if the process is automated? If a busy executive needs to approve all the 
expense reports but he doesn’t manage his email inbox well, you’ll have to carefully set 
expectations about what efficiency gains you’ll get with automated approvals.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      279
Assigning workflow tasks
To create a new workflow task, first go to the workflow rule that you want to asso-
ciate with this task and then follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Workflow & Approvals ➪ Workflow Rules 
and click the Rule Name of the appropriate rule.
The Workflow Rule page for the rule appears.
2.	 Click Edit from the Workflow Actions related list.
The Specify Workflow Actions step appears.
3.	 In the Immediate Workflow Actions area, click the Add Workflow Action 
button and select New Task from the resulting drop-down list.
4.	 Configure the task as you would a regular task, but note the Due Date field.
5.	 Complete the Due Date field so that the created task has a due date that’s a 
number of days relative to a base date you select in the drop-down list.
6.	 Click Save when finished.
The Workflow Task page for this task appears. Note that the Rules Using This 
Workflow Task related list shows the associated workflow rule.
Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Workflow & Approvals ➪ Field Updates to select 
what field on what object changes when a workflow rule is triggered.
Using workflow email alerts
To create a new workflow email alert, first go to the workflow rule that you want 
to associate with this task and then follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Workflow & Approvals ➪ Workflow Rules 
and click the Rule Name of the appropriate rule.
The Workflow Rule page for the rule appears.
2.	 Click Edit from the Workflow Actions related list.
The Specify Workflow Actions step appears.
3.	 In the Immediate Workflow Actions area, click the Add Workflow Action 
button and select New Email Alert from the resulting drop-down list.
4.	 Complete the fields to associate an email template with a set of ­recipients.
Note that the recipients may or may not be Salesforce users. And remember 
that the email template must have already been created.

280      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
5.	 Click Save when finished.
The Workflow Alert page for this alert appears.
At the Specify Workflow Actions page, you can also click the Add Workflow 
Action button to have a new field updated, or an outbound message sent 
when a certain event occurs.
Understanding the Process Builder
Now that you’ve learned about workflow rules as a new Salesforce administrator, 
you’ll find that you can reflect many business process steps in Salesforce with a 
few clicks, without having to stand in line and wait for programmers to get around 
to helping you out. For example, you can easily create a workflow to create a 
“Schedule on-boarding call” task for your success manager, three days after any 
opportunity over $250,000 reaches the “Closed Won” stage.
There are times when you may have to link several business steps, and find that 
manually creating workflow rules can get a little tedious. In the preceding exam-
ple, you may want to instead schedule the sending of an onboarding email two 
days after any opportunity below $5,000 reaches the “Closed Won” stage.
In this section, we provide a high-level introduction to the Process Builder and its 
various steps needed so you can, well, build your first process.
Choosing to use the Process Builder
If you find that you have more than one “If this happens, then do that” process 
that you want to daisy-chain together and automate in Salesforce, consider using 
the Process Builder. The Process Builder is a more powerful alternative to work-
flow rules, and is accessed via a point-and-click graphical interface. It lets you 
build and see all the logical “if this, then that” actions for one business process. 
The Process Builder is available in Enterprise and Unlimited editions.
Some more commonly requested actions that Process Builder can perform that a 
regular workflow can’t, include the following:
»
» Creating a new record
»
» Updating a related record in addition to the specific one that kicked off the 
process

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      281
»
» Posting a comment to Chatter
»
» Submitting an approval
If you’ve inherited a Salesforce organization with a lot of custom code and have 
technical knowledge about Apex, review the details about Process Builder limits 
and considerations, accessed via Salesforce Help. Click the Help link at the top 
right of every Salesforce page, and type process limits and considerations for 
more detailed technical reading.
Creating processes
In this section, we continue with our high-level overview of what steps are needed 
to build a new process.
Before you dive into using the Process Builder, make sure you can sketch out your 
process as simply as possible. Streamline your process so you can explain, “If X 
happens, then Y. If X doesn’t happen, then evaluate this other criteria and decide 
to do something.”
If you start hearing yourself describe umpteen subjective exceptions like “Well, 
sometimes we don’t do ABC; instead, we do XYZ if the sales rep doesn’t like to do 
ABC” with no consistent pattern, stop and take a step back. If you can’t explain 
the process using words that can then be reflected in a business process diagram, 
the technology won’t be able to understand you, either.
The goal of automation is to streamline the execution of repetitive business pro-
cesses that impact the majority of your use cases, and to accommodate common 
exceptions. Check that your teams aren’t overengineering a solution that is built 
for exceptions. Consultants and developers may willingly build you something 
that matches your exact specifications, but making that flexible and scalable in 
the future to adapt to changing business processes may be more time-consuming 
(or expensive) than anticipated.
A process starts when a record belonging to an object that you specify is created or 
edited. For example, a process can be built based on the Opportunity object, which 
you’ll identify. The process can be run the first time a new record is created, or 
when the record has been created or edited.
Adding process criteria
After identifying the object that will start the process, you’ll want to add in your 
various criteria. Think of these as the “ifs” in the number of if/then conditions 

282      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
that you want to build. You’ll add criteria based on conditions that you get to set, 
either via filter criteria or by writing a formula. You can also set criteria to evalu-
ate nothing, and automatically default to being true, which then executes the 
actions. An example of some conditions appears in Figure 17-9.
If initial criteria are not met, you may create further criteria to address what hap-
pens next. If you don’t create other criteria and your one criteria’s condition isn’t 
met, then nothing happens. Which sometimes is what you want to happen.
Adding process actions
After creating your criteria, you need to define at least one action that occurs if 
those criteria are true. Actions can happen immediately, and more than one action 
can happen simultaneously. Depending on certain details (for example, if actions 
are executed only if specific changes are made to a record), actions can be sched-
uled to happen a set time in the future.
Activating and deactivating processes
After you’ve created your process, you’ll need to activate it to make it live. If you 
realize that, after it’s activated, you need to make edits to your process, you’ll 
need to deactivate the process. If something is really not going right, deactivate it 
immediately. If you want to make a more iterative adjustment, clone the process 
first to make changes, then plan out a smoother deactivation of the outdated pro-
cess, and an activation of the cloned-and-edited process. Even if a process is 
FIGURE 17-9:  
Setting conditions 
of satisfaction for 
your criteria.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      283
deactivated, you won’t be able to edit it. This is most likely due to compliance-
related reasons.
If you’re up for diving into the details of building out your first process, click Help 
in the upper right of any Salesforce page; then type process builder in the search 
bar that appears in the Salesforce Success Community.
Creating Actions
If your org is using Chatter, you’ll see that adding things to the Chatter feed is 
done by clicking icons and their related names that appear above a comment box, 
as shown in Figure 17-10. Those icons and their related names are collectively 
known as Actions.
As you and your users begin to adopt Salesforce more, you can really help acceler-
ate user adoption by helping them reduce clicks and page scrolling for their most 
common tasks with Actions. In this section, we provide a high-level overview of 
Actions, various types of Actions, and how you can create new ones for your users.
Actions (not to be confused with process actions mentioned in the previous sec-
tion) can be considered shortcuts to most common repetitive behaviors performed 
by your users. Actions appear in the top of the home page, or any record detail 
page for any object for which you have enabled it. Some of the more common 
terms that you’ll hear include the following:
» Standard Chatter Actions: These are the default Actions you see when 
Chatter is enabled for your org. They allow you to post a comment, share a 
file, embed a link, create a poll, and more.
» Default Actions: These are canned behaviors that Salesforce has already 
created, which you can use to get up and running with Actions. Behaviors like 
logging a call or event, or creating a new contact, can be done from these 
predefined Actions. You’ll have the freedom to decide which standard object 
records can benefit from this.
» Nonstandard Actions: These are Actions that you create, because they don’t 
already exist as default Actions. They don’t require additional programming to 
create the Action.
FIGURE 17-10:  
Viewing Actions 
on a Lead record.

284      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
»
» Object-specific Actions: These are default or nonstandard Actions that are 
used for a specific object’s record. This means that details from that related 
object can be auto-populated in that Action, to reduce manual entry and 
increase productivity.
»
» Global Actions: These are Actions that can appear on any page, like the 
Home or Chatter page, or also on object pages. Unlike object-specific Actions, 
clicking a global Action creates records that have no relationship with the 
record from which the Action was invoked.
Figure 17-11 shows an example of global Actions that appear in the Chatter feed of 
someone’s home page, and the various types of common behavior replicated by 
Actions.
Creating Actions
Knowing where to go to create Actions depends on whether you want to create 
an  object-specific action or a global one. Object-specific actions for standard 
objects are created from the specific object’s section under the Setup ➪ Build ➪  
Customize ➪ Object Name ➪ Button, Links, and Actions link. Object-specific actions 
for custom objects is also possible from the custom object’s detail page under 
Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Objects ➪ Custom Object.
Creating an action is straightforward, as shown in Figure 17-12. You tell Salesforce 
what type of action you want performed, what name is displayed for the action, 
and whether you want to accept Salesforce’s default icon. For certain fields, you 
can assign predefined values, which helps the users reduce the clicks they have 
to make.
FIGURE 17-11:  
Viewing available 
Actions on a 
home page.

CHAPTER 17  Performing Common Configurations      285
After you’ve created the action, Salesforce displays what default fields someone 
has to fill out when she invokes that action, in the Action Layout Editor. You can 
move fields around, remove some fields, add some fields — all using the same 
user interface as the Page Layout Editor, mentioned earlier in this chapter in the 
“Customizing Page and Search Layouts” section.
These are actions meant for quick creation and completion. Don’t overwhelm the 
action layout with too many fields.
Adding Actions to page layouts
After creating your Action, you now need to add that button to the page layout for 
the object on which you want the Action to appear. We discuss how to access page 
layouts to customize earlier in this chapter in the “Customizing Page and Search 
Layouts” section. The point is that you can move your Action so that it falls any-
where within the list of other action icons. In Figure 17-13, a default action on the 
lead record has been moved to the first action.

FIGURE 17-13:

action on the 
page.

286      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
On the page layout editor, you’ll see various Action layout options. Quick Actions 
are synonymous with actions we described in the previous section. They appear 
within a web browser page of a user’s Salesforce Classic UI. Ignore the Salesforce1 
and Lightning Experience Actions section — that refers to more advanced cus-
tomization on a mobile device, or within the Lightning Experience UI.

n Chapter  17, you get an understanding of the most common configuration 
options available to you out of the box. If you’ve read that chapter, you under-
stand what it means to build fields, work with records, use record types, and get 
even more comfortable with business automation. In Chapter 19, we go over how 
to further customize Salesforce by building objects and apps that make sense for 
your particular business model. This chapter, on the other hand, shows you some 
specific configuration options for standard objects in Salesforce.
As you already know (assuming you’ve read some of this book before turning to 
this page), Salesforce comes preconfigured with standard objects and standard 
fields in simple layouts for each of these standard objects. We cover these 
objects — such as Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, and Cases — in 
earlier chapters.
In this chapter, we set out to show users common configuration tools and settings 
as they relate to these standard objects, and what they do for your organization. 
We cover sales-specific standard object settings, and then discuss settings on 
Chapter 18

288      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
marketing-related objects, followed by service settings. By the end of this chap-
ter, you’ll have a good idea of which settings can be toggled for specific objects, as 
opposed to the more general settings that apply across all standard objects in 
Salesforce.
Configuring Sales-Specific Settings
As you probably already know, Sales Cloud standard objects really center around 
Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities. Of course, we can extend that to include a 
number of other objects. You’re probably already raising your eyebrows and won-
dering about them. However, if we wanted to cover everything, we’d need a lot 
more blank pages and you’d have a lot more reading to do. Let’s get into some of 
Salesforce’s configuration settings that are specific to sales organizations.
Using Account Settings
You use an account record to collect all the critical information about the companies 
with which you interact. If you go to the Setup menu, you’ll find some options 
under accounts that don’t appear under other objects. One of those subheadings is 
Account Settings.
You can use Account Settings to indicate two default behaviors for your organiza-
tion. The first toggles the organization’s View Hierarchy link and the second 
enables Account Insights.
Showing the View Hierarchy link
In Salesforce, you can create account parent/child relationships to distinguish 
between departments, subsidiaries, or locations of the same overarching entity 
you do business with. For example, your APAC sales team can be selling to Gold-
man Brothers Headquarters in Hong Kong, while your central region sales director 
attends meetings at the Goldman Brothers office in downtown Chicago. (See 
Chapter  8 for in-depth information on account parent/child relationships in 
Salesforce.) The children all roll up to the parent (usually, HQ), and the tiers can 
be easily viewed in the form of an account hierarchy, as shown in Figure 18-1.
To make this tiered hierarchy visible directly from the account record, you have to 
enable this setting under Account Settings. To do this, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪  
Accounts ➪ Account Settings and click the Show View Hierarchy link. Now, when 
you click into an account, you see a link that says View Hierarchy to the right of 
Account Name, as shown in Figure 18-2.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      289
This step is important to save time when navigating between large volumes of 
subsidiaries or locations for a single customer. It allows users to view hierarchies 
visually, making the tiered structure less theoretical.
You can’t enable this link for a subset of users. When you turn it on, anyone with 
access to that account can see and click the link.
Enabling Account Insights
Account Insights uses third-party technologies (such as Twitter and news arti-
cles) to gather real and recent insights and news information about the account in 
question. It helps users and salespeople stay up to date on relevant accounts and 
industries they work with on a daily basis. For example, Account Insights can help 
a rep know that now is not the best time to reach out to his point of contact at 
Larry’s Laundry, if news articles show that Larry’s Laundry is currently under 
investigation for money laundering.
To enable account insights, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Accounts ➪ Account Settings,  
select the Enable Account Insights check box, and click Save. Figure 18-3 shows 
what Account Insights looks like on the account detail page if you have Lightning 
enabled for your organization. See Chapter 20 for more information on the Light-
ning interface.
FIGURE 18-1:  
Viewing the 
account 
hierarchy.
FIGURE 18-2:  
The View 
Hierarchy link on 
an account.

290      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
You can only view Account Insights in Salesforce1 or if your organization is Light-
ning enabled.
Building Account Teams
If you work at a large company, you probably know that it takes a team of people 
to win complex deals and maintain large accounts. The Account Owner field may 
identify the primary person in charge, but often you need to know whom to go to 
for a specific purpose, or maybe the account owner is just out sick or on vacation. 
Account Teams lets you list all the individuals at your company who work with an 
account and detail their specific role.
To enable Account Teams for your organization, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Accounts ➪ Account Teams.
The Account Team Setup page appears.
2.	 Click Enable Account Teams and then select the Account Teams Enabled 
check box, as shown in Figure 18-4; then click Save.
The Page Layout Selection page appears, allowing you to select all the Account 
page layouts to which you want to add the Account Teams related list. If you 
have account types (and layouts) that never require team collaboration, don’t 
add the related list to these.
3.	 (Optional) Select the account page layouts to which you want to add the 
Account Teams related list and click Save.
The Account Team Setup page appears, where you can choose to define team 
roles for your organization. 
FIGURE 18-3:  
Viewing Account 
Insights on the 
account detail 
page.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      291
Now that Account Teams are enabled for your organization, to give credit to your 
team and make sure that others know whom to call, go to an account record and 
follow these steps:
1.	 Scroll down to the Account Team related list or click the Account Team 
hover link at the top of the page.
If you don’t see the Account Team related list, have your administrator activate 
the feature in Setup.
2.	 Click the Add button to add up to five team members.
The New Account Team Members page appears, as shown in Figure 18-5.
3.	 Use the Team Member lookups to select fellow users of Salesforce who work 
on this account.
You can always go back and add more later.
4.	 (Optional) Specify the sharing access you want to give for this account, its 
opportunities, and its cases.
5.	 Select the appropriate role in the Team Role drop-down list.
6.	 Click Save.
You’re returned to the account record’s detail page with your Account Team 
listed.
FIGURE 18-4:  
Enabling Account 
Teams.
FIGURE 18-5:  
Add Account 
Team members.

292      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
You can always define or modify the roles available in the Team Role drop-down 
list by choosing Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Accounts ➪ Account Teams, and clicking the 
Team Roles link. You can add new roles, rename existing ones, or just change the 
order in which they appear in the list.
These Team Roles also define how they appear on Opportunity teams.
Identifying contact roles on opportunities
Adding contact roles to your opportunities is pretty easy (see Chapter 10). In case you 
don’t remember, contact roles are really a way to specify the role the contact plays 
on this opportunity or in your business process. In this way, the individual or team 
that is selling on a given opportunity can better understand the players involved and 
whom to reach out to. If a business user asks for a new contact role or wants to cus-
tomize the existing contact roles available on your opportunities, read on.
To customize contact roles on opportunities, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Opportunities ➪ Contact Roles on 
Opportunities.
The opportunity contact roles picklist values appear, as shown in Figure 18-6.
2.	 Click the Edit link to the left of the role you want to edit.
The edit page appears for the contact role picklist value you selected.
3.	 Rename the role in the Opportunity Contact Role field, or select the available 
check box to make this role the default value.
4.	 Click Save when you’re done.
FIGURE 18-6:  
Customizing 
contact roles on 
opportunities.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      293
Now that you’ve edited the default contact roles for a given opportunity, you’re 
ready to let your sales users select them. To learn how to add them to your oppor-
tunities, see Chapter 10.
Tracking different sales processes
The final sales-related setting that we cover is what Salesforce calls sales processes. 
In Salesforce, a sales process determines which opportunity stages are selectable 
for a given record type. (See Chapter 17 for more information about record types.)
You can create multiple sales processes if your organization has different types of 
deals that follow different paths to close. In other words, if selling one product 
line requires more effort, qualification, and stages than another, simpler product, 
you can use multiple sales processes to accommodate both.
To create a sales process in Salesforce, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Opportuni-
ties ➪ Sales Processes, as shown in Figure 18-7.
1.	 Click the New button.
The New Sales Process page appears.
2.	 Type a name for your sales process and a description to make it easier to 
identify later; then click Save.
The Sales Process Opportunity Stages page appears, as shown in Figure 18-8.
3.	 Select the Opportunity Stage values for the process by using the add and 
remove arrows; when you’re done, click Save.
That’s it! You’ve created your first sales process and added the appropriate 
stages to it.
FIGURE 18-7:  
Using the Sales 
Processes page to 
create or 
maintain 
opportunity 
processes.

294      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
To use each of your processes, you’ll have to associate them to your opportunity 
record types. When you create or edit an opportunity record type, you’ll see a 
picklist value called Sales Process, where you can select the corresponding process 
for that opportunity type.
Managing Marketing-Related Settings
Now that you know about sales-specific settings and where to go to enable them, 
let’s talk marketing.
Assigning leads
Nobody wants a database full of leads if they’re not assigned to the right people. 
When you have incoming leads, you have to make sure they’re assigned appropri-
ately. To do this, you can set up some assignment rules to automate lead routing, 
as we show you in Chapter 7. Reassigning leads is easy — we show you how to 
reassign record ownership in Chapter  17. Use these out-of-the-box Salesforce 
tools to increase your marketing power and efficiency.
Choosing a default lead owner
Salesforce requires that you choose a default lead owner, so that new leads that 
come into your system don’t fall through the cracks (assuming they don’t meet 
any of your lead assignment rule criteria). The lead owner can be a lead queue, an 
appointed data steward in your organization, or your system admin, depending on 
the size of your company and whether you have a governance structure imple-
mented within it.
FIGURE 18-8:  
Selecting 
Opportunity 
Stages for your 
sales process.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      295
To select a default lead owner, click Setup and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Customize ➪ Leads ➪ Lead Settings.
The Lead Settings page appears, as shown in Figure 18-9.
2.	 Click the Edit button.
The Edit Lead Settings page appears, with the Lead Queue Settings section at 
the top.
3.	 From the drop-down menu, choose whether you want the type of owner to 
be a User or Queue, and then click the lookup icon and select the user or 
queue.
4.	 (Optional) Select the Notify Default Lead Owner check box to send a notifica-
tion email to the owner inbox when the lead is assigned.
5.	 Click Save when you’re done.
Great! Now you’ve assigned a default lead owner, so your leads will be auto-
assigned to this user or queue when they can’t be routed based on other rules and 
criteria you’ve established.
Confirming lead conversion settings
Lead conversion is an important process in Salesforce, and we talk a lot about it in 
Chapter 7. There are three default lead conversion settings you can set up for your 
organization.
FIGURE 18-9:  
Looking at the 
Lead Settings 
page.

296      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
First, choose Setup ➪  Customize ➪ Leads ➪ Lead Settings. You see the second sec-
tion, Lead Conversion Settings, with three options, as shown in Figure 18-9:
»
» Require Validation for Converted Leads: Use this option to enforce 
validation rules when converting leads.
»
» Preserve Lead Status: This option comes into play if your organization uses 
record types on the Lead object. If this check box is selected, the Lead Status 
doesn’t automatically change to the new owner’s default value during 
conversion. Use this option if you want to keep the lead status as-is during 
conversion no matter what.
»
» Enable Conversions on the Salesforce1 App: Use this option if you want  
to give users the ability to convert their leads through the Salesforce1  
mobile app.
Capturing campaign influence
Campaigns and campaign influence are two cornerstones of marketing. Any mar-
keting department sees the value in capturing the return on investment (ROI) of 
their campaigns and tying revenue back to their efforts. You can choose to associ-
ate influential campaigns to opportunities automatically or manually.
To enable the automatic campaign association to opportunities, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Campaigns ➪ Campaign Influence.
The Campaign Influence page appears, as shown in Figure 18-10.
2.	 Under Enable or Disable Automatic Association, click Enabled.
Now, if a campaign is related to a contact role on an opportunity and the 
opportunity hasn’t closed, the campaign will automatically be associated with 
that opportunity. For example, select Disabled if you prefer to manage and 
associate influential campaigns manually on a one-off basis using the 
Campaign Influence related list.
3.	 (Optional) Enter a Campaign Influence Time Frame.
This allows you to designate the maximum number of days between the date 
when the campaign was first associated and the date the opportunity was 
created. For example, if you enter 20 days as the time frame, and one of your 
contacts becomes a member of a campaign on August 1, the campaign will be 
considered influential to any opportunity associated with that contact by 
August 20.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      297
4.	 (Optional) Create association rules to add additional criteria that 
campaigns must meet in order to be automatically associated with an 
opportunity.
Setting Customizations for Your  
Service Organizations
The service side of Salesforce also has some settings that need to be taken into 
account when setting up cases and other service-oriented objects. Let’s jump in 
and take a look at what we can configure out of the box.
Understanding Support Settings  
for your cases
Support Settings are fairly comprehensive in Salesforce, and we don’t go into 
every one. However, we do cover the most commonly used settings, and for the 
rest, you can consult other resources, like Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies, by 
Jon Paz and TJ Kelley (Wiley), to get the help you need.
To get to the Support Settings, shown in Figure  18-11, choose Setup ➪  
Customize ➪ Cases ➪ Support Settings. Here are some common settings:
»
» Default Case Owner: A required field that defaults to an owner for cases 
when case assignment rules fail to locate one.
FIGURE 18-10:  
The Campaign 
Influence page.

298      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
»
» Automated Case User: A required field that is listed as the actor in the Case 
History related list for automated case changes, such as when escalation or 
assignment rules fire.
It’s usually best to have the Automate Case User be a Service Cloud admin or 
super user.
»
» Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field: Select this option if you’d rather 
not have users fill out information on a separate closed case page layout and 
you’d prefer to let them just close out a case quickly through the status 
picklist.
»
» Enable Case Feed Actions and Feed Items: Select this option to change your 
cases to the upgraded case user interface. You’ll have to also give users access 
to the Case Feed.
For more in-depth information about these options and others, see Salesforce 
­Service Cloud For Dummies.
Defining escalation rules
Escalation rules are criteria and rules you define when you want cases to be auto-
matically escalated. For example, let’s say you have three different tiers of sup-
port: Gold, Silver, and Bronze. You can create different escalation rules to say that 
if a case with Gold support isn’t resolved within 24 hours, it will be escalated to a 
support manager.
To create an escalation rule, choose Setup ➪ Customize ➪ Cases ➪ Escalation Rules, 
and follow these steps:
FIGURE 18-11:  
The Support 
Settings page.

CHAPTER 18  Diving Deeper into Standard Object Setup      299
1.	 Click the New button to create a new escalation rule, enter a name for it, 
and click Save.
Don’t select the Active check box until you’re done with the escalation rule and 
you deactivate any currently active rules.
2.	 Click the new escalation rule you created, and then click the New button in 
the Rule Entry list.
The Rule Entry Edit page appears, as shown in Figure 18-12.
3.	 Enter the sort order in which Salesforce will run this particular rule entry.
This comes into play when you have multiple rules. Salesforce evaluates each 
entry in the order you designate and stops looking when it finds a criteria 
match.
4.	 Select criteria for the rule entry.
In Figure 18-12, the rule entry indicates three criteria that, if met, will automati-
cally escalate the case. If the case is (a) high priority, (b) a problem (as opposed 
to an inquiry or feature request type of case), and (c) owned by Tier 1 (or the 
highest tier of support), the case will be escalated.
5.	 Select the business hours criteria for the rule.
You can choose to use the organization’s business hours, use the case-specific 
business hours, or ignore them altogether. Business hours help support teams 
so that you time-based criteria run only during your business hours.
6.	 Select how escalation times are set, and click Save.
FIGURE 18-12:

entry criteria for 
your escalation 
rule.

300      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Now you’ve created your first escalation rule! Go into a case, set the criteria you’ve 
chosen, and test it out. But first, don’t forget to go back and activate the escalation 
rule.
We’ve shown you some of the inside tips on object-specific settings in the Setup 
menu for Sales, Marketing, and Service. Now you have a basic foundation and 
understanding of where certain settings are toggled for which objects. We encour-
age you to go in and get your hands dirty. Explore for yourself!

Force.com is the Salesforce platform you use to customize and create on-demand 
applications simply by pointing and clicking your mouse on easy-to-use web

from the AppExchange directory (www.appexchange.com).
In this chapter, we demystify the Force.com platform and define some basic terms

Chapter 19

302      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Understanding Elements of  
the Force.com Platform
Force.com is the Salesforce.com on-demand platform: a suite of development tools 
for customizing, building, integrating, and installing business ­applications — and 
you don’t need to build or maintain any infrastructure yourself to use it.
Force.com is both a collection of customization tools as well as the underlying 
infrastructure that powers the Salesforce app that you use. The cool part is that, 
over time, Salesforce.com engineers have exposed parts of their secret sauce so 
that you can use it, too, and they’ve also used these customization tools to build 
additional features into Salesforce.
Briefly, here are some key terms you need to know:
»
» Force.com: The engine that makes Salesforce what it is today. It’s the 
underlying technology that enables you to customize existing applications 
from the Setup area, create new ones (with or without any programming 
experience), integrate Salesforce with other company systems, and share 
these snippets online with others.
»
» Apex code: Another subset of the Force.com platform. The Salesforce 
procedural scripting language that allows users to write custom logic and 
create integrations between Salesforce and other systems. If you’re technical, 
you now have the ability to build new objects, create triggers and classes, 
change the user interface (UI) to handle custom forms and interactions, use a 
web services application programming interface (API), and all that techno-
speak stuff.
»
» Visualforce: Another powerful technical capability that Salesforce provides. 
You can use it to customize the actual front-end page design and components 
of your custom application. You’re no longer limited to Salesforce’s default 
colors, visual design, and tab layouts.
»
» AppExchange: An online directory where you can quickly browse, try, 
download, and install apps that can instantly run alongside your existing 
Salesforce applications.
Salesforce.com frequently rebrands the names of its various offerings. The pre-
ceding terms are the most recent versions as of this book’s publication. The 
underlying functionality, look, and feel that we discuss is still the same as we 
describe it.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      303
Unless you’re a developer (or a glutton for punishment), you don’t need to know 
the technical ins and outs. What you do need to know is that Force.com enables 
Salesforce administrators to easily customize and extend their existing on-
demand applications without extensive involvement from developers. For build-
ing applications, which can take months with traditional software, you can point 
and click to quickly develop new applications in hours or days, completely inte-
grated with your existing Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) 
system.
To see all options available to you with building Custom apps, log in to Salesforce 
and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build.
The Build page appears. This page highlights all the features and functionality 
available to help you customize, build, share, and integrate your CRM.
2.	 On the sidebar menu, notice the menu items below the Build header.
This chapter focuses on the tools listed under the Create header. We cover the 
Customize header in Chapter 17. We don’t discuss Develop because that’s a 
more technical discussion, and we promised you “no code required.”
Preparing Your Custom App Strategy
Force.com places so much potential at your fingertips that just like a kid in a 
candy store, you may have the urge to just jump in and start building custom 
objects and tabs — a baptism by fire. Although that method is appetizing in the-
ory, it’s a quick way in reality to get a stomachache, especially if your business 
grows and more people start entering information in Salesforce. Resist that 
impulse until you review these simple steps for planning your strategy for on-
demand applications:
1.	 Define and prioritize objectives.
Your wish list doesn’t need to be very involved, but it should spell out the who, 
what, when, why, and how.
2.	 Build a plan.
With agreed-upon objectives, take your project down another level and lay out 
a plan to address the most pressing objectives.

304      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
3.	 Determine the most suitable approach.
You have many different ways to tackle a business issue with Force.com — 
some better than others.
•	 Use the discussion boards at the Salesforce Success Community website 
(http://success.salesforce.com) to check existing or upcoming 
functionality. You may not need to build a unique solution.
•	 Browse the AppExchange to see whether any available prebuilt applications 
meet your general requirements.
4.	 Keep it simple.
Don’t sacrifice your objectives at the expense of simplicity — although at the 
beginning, simple is often better.
5.	 Start with the end in mind.
If a custom app seems like the right strategy, figure out what it is that you want 
to measure. Understand how well your solution may scale (or not).
A great way to design your application so that it takes full advantage of relation-
ships is to simply draw it out on a piece of paper or a white board. Your design 
doesn’t have to be fancy or complicated, but it should define the standard and 
custom objects you need and how they should be linked.
Creating Custom Objects
Once you have a plan, you’ll have to know how to create its building blocks. In this 
section, we tell you how to create custom objects and relate them to each other.
Building your custom objects
Typically, you create a custom object to house a discrete set of information that’s 
different from what is contained in other standard objects. For example, an 
Opportunity object contains opportunity information. A Custom Expense object 
contains information about expenses that’s unique from the typical purpose of 
other standard objects.
If you want to build a home, you have to add the basic building blocks first. The 
same analogy applies to custom apps and objects. For example, if you want to 
build a recruiting application, you may decide that you could use the Contacts 
object for applicants and need to build custom objects for Job Postings and Inter-
view Feedback because they’re distinct blocks of data.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      305
To set up a new object, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Objects.
The Custom Objects page appears. This page, your starting point for creating 
an object, is where all your custom objects are displayed.
2.	 Click the New Custom Object button.
The New Custom Object page appears.
3.	 In the Custom Object Information section, type the basic details for your 
object.
You usually just need to fill out the Label and Plural Label fields. This will then 
automatically populate the Object Name field. Labels are what your end-users 
see (like “Time Off Request”). The object name is what Force.com sees (like 
“Time_Off_Req”) in case you need to have another system (or another part of 
Salesforce) talk to it.
4.	 Complete the Enter Record Name Label and Format fields.
The record name appears on page layouts, related lists, lookups, and search 
results. This is what you use to differentiate one record of this object from 
another. Depending on the type of object you’re creating, you may want to 
switch the data type from Text to Auto Number.
Here’s how to tell when to use text versus auto numbers:
•	 Text: The name has some intrinsic value.
•	 Auto numbers: You’re creating an object that will relate to other standard 
objects in a fundamental way. Auto numbers are useful for sequenced 
business documents, such as invoices, purchase orders, IT tickets, and 
timecards.
5.	 Select the custom object’s optional features.
With simple pointing and clicking on your part, Force.com allows you to select 
your custom object’s features that are identical to many of the features found 
on standard objects, such as tracking activities, allowing reporting, or tracking 
its field history.
6.	 Leave the Deployment Status as In Development so that only you can see it, 
instead of all the other Salesforce users within your company.
We recommend making sure that you can explain the business process 
around using the new object before deploying it to help guide correct adoption.
Select the Deployed button if you’re ready for your users to begin using it. If 
you wait to deploy the object, return to this screen by choosing Setup ➪ Build ➪  
Create ➪ Objects. Select your object from the list of custom objects, and you 
return to the custom object detail page.

306      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
7.	 Select the Launch New Custom Tab Wizard check box and then click Save.
The New Custom Object Tab Wizard starts. See the section “Adding a tab to a 
custom object,” later in this chapter, for the how-to’s on building a new tab.
If you already mapped the custom objects that will be part of your app, create all 
the objects first before modifying them. This action is especially helpful if you’re 
building relationships between them.
Modifying custom objects
Designing your custom object is as simple as modifying a contact record or adding 
to a contact record’s related lists. If you need to change the basic settings, simply 
click the Edit button at the top of the Custom Object page for the object, and the 
Edit Custom Object Wizard reappears.
If you want to customize your new object, you can point and click through the 
related lists on the page.
Certain Setup features — including custom profiles, multiple page layouts, record 
types, workflow, and field-level security — are available only in the Enterprise 
and Unlimited editions.
Building relationships
One primary reason for building applications with Force.com is to create a single, 
integrated, one-stop shopping experience for your users.
The key to those linkages is building custom relationships between objects. For 
example, if your company wants to manage account planning in Salesforce, you 
want to create a relationship between the standard Account object and a custom 
object for the Account Plan.
To build a relationship, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Objects.
The All Custom Objects page appears.
2.	 Click the desired custom object under the Label column.
The Custom Object page appears.
3.	 Click the New button in the Custom Fields & Relationships related list (see 
Figure 19-1).
The New Custom Field Wizard appears.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      307
4.	 In Step 1 of the New Custom Field Wizard, choose the type of relationship 
with another object.
Force.com supports two types of custom relationships: Master-Detail and 
Lookup. They’re both one-to-many relationships.
A Lookup relationship links one object to another. The representative custom 
field will have a little magnifying glass icon next to it so that you can “look up” a 
value from that related object to associate with another object. Master-Detail 
(also known as parent-child) relationships are a special type of association: The 
relationship is required for the detail. If you delete the master record, its 
related children are also deleted.
The two relationships look the same in the UI — as a lookup field with a 
magnifying glass on the right side and as a related list on the related object.
But here are two big differences:
•	 Master-Detail relationships cause the cascade deletion of child 
records to occur when the parent record is deleted. For example, if you 
delete an account, all related child records are also deleted.
•	 In a Master-Detail relationship, the detail record inherits the Owner 
and sharing rules of the master record. Detail objects are dependent on 
their masters. In Lookup relationships, however, they don’t transfer 
sharing rules — they’re completely independent.
When in doubt, start with the Lookup option.
5.	 Click Next to continue.
6.	 In Step 2 of the wizard, select the other object that you want to relate your 
object to.
You can create as many as 40 Lookup relationships and up to two Master-
Detail relationships with a custom object.
FIGURE 19-1:  
Create a new 
custom field or 
relationship.

308      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
7.	Click Next to continue.
8.	In Step 3 of the wizard, enter the label for the lookup field.
As a default, Force.com prefills the fields with the name of the object you 
selected, although you can change it.
9.	Click Next to continue.
10.	If you have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, set the field-level security in Step 
4 of the wizard. (If you don’t, skip to Step 14 because you won’t be able to set 
field-level security.)
If you chose the Master-Detail option, the security is set for you because it 
must be available within field-level security. If you chose the Lookup option, 
select the appropriate check boxes to control visibility and edit rights to the 
field.
11.	Click Next to continue.
12.	If you have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, in Step 5 of the wizard, select the 
page layouts in which you want to display the field.
Suppose that you’re creating an expense application. You may want the rep’s 
layout to be different from the manager’s layout.
13.	Click Next to continue.
14.	In Step 6 of the wizard, deselect the check boxes if you don’t want the 
custom object to appear on the related list of the selected object.
For example, if you’re linking expenses with accounts, you may not want a long 
list of expenses showing up on an account record.
15.	When you’re done, click Save.
The Custom Object page reappears, and your custom relationship is displayed 
in the Custom Fields & Relationships related list.
Build your relationships before loading any actual data.
Remember that between two objects, you can have only one object that allows the 
Master-Detail relationship, so the other object has to be a Lookup relationship. A 
standard object also can’t be the child of a Master-Detail relationship.
If you’re drawing out your entity relationship diagram and find that you need two 
objects to have a many-to-many relationship with each other, build a junction 
object between the two. The junction object will act as a bridge between two 
objects, to give the impression of two Master-Detail relationships.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      309
Here are some other ways that you can modify custom objects to fit your compa-
ny’s business processes:
»
» Creating fields: With Force.com, you can quickly add fields to your custom 
object, much like you can with a standard object, such as an account or a 
contact. See Chapter 17 for more information on creating custom fields.
»
» Changing layouts: After or as you build fields, feel free to start rearranging 
the page layout for the object record. Often, that’s one of the easiest ways to 
get a pulse on what’s missing from your record. See Chapter 17 for more 
information on editing page layouts.
»
» Customizing related lists: After you add your Lookup relationships and 
custom fields, you’re ready to start customizing your related lists. Force.com 
allows you to modify the columns that are displayed in a related list.
Don’t forget this step because without customizing this section, your users 
don’t see much in a related list. When you add the right columns, though, the 
related list becomes a powerful tool for your users. By customizing the col-
umns displayed in a related list, users can quickly see a summary of relevant 
information from a record’s detail page. See Chapter 17 for more information 
on customizing related lists.
Creating Custom Apps
After you sketch the basic requirements for your new application, and built the 
objects that you need, you’re ready to begin assembling this into an app. The cus-
tom app is much like a container, into which you associate your objects and tabs.
To see an example of custom apps that others have created, visit the AppExchange 
(www.appexchange.com) and browse apps by category. Apps created by Force.com 
Labs are those that came from Salesforce.com’s own employees.
Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create to get to a powerful set of customization tools that 
can empower your business faster than the status quo of traditional software 
solutions.
Setting up a custom app
Many companies want internal branding for their business applications. Before 
you can apply branding like this, though, you have to first add the logo to a public 
folder on the Documents tab. (From any page, click the Documents tab; create a 
new public folder that’s easily identifiable, like Logos; and click the New Document 

310      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
button from within that folder.) Make sure that the image is a GIF or JPEG file 
smaller than 20KB. Ideally, use a horizontal image. If it’s larger than 300 x 55 
pixels, Salesforce will scale the image to fit the space.
To add the custom app, choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create and then follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Apps link in the sidebar.
The Apps page appears. You see a list of your standard Salesforce apps, plus 
any custom apps you created.
2.	 Click the New button above the Apps list.
3.	 In Step 1 of the New Custom App Wizard, select what type of app you want to 
create, and click Next.
4.	 In Step 2 of the wizard, enter a label and description for your app, and click 
Next.
The name you type in the label field appears on the Force.com Apps pull-down 
menu.
5.	 In Step 3 of the wizard, assuming that you want to apply your branding, 
insert a logo from your Documents tab, and then click Next.
You have to first add the logo to a public folder on the Documents tab.
The logo will appear as the header whenever a user selects the custom app 
from the Force.com Apps menu. Of course, if you don’t want to brand the app, 
you can leave the current Salesforce-provided image.
6.	 In Step 4 of the wizard, select the tabs that will make up your app, and then 
click Next.
You do this step simply by clicking tabs from the Available Tabs box and using 
the arrow buttons to create your list of Selected Tabs.
If you haven’t created all your custom tabs yet, don’t worry. As you create 
custom tabs, you can associate them with your custom or standard apps. (For 
all the details, see the section “Creating custom tabs,” later in this chapter.)
7.	 In Step 5 of the wizard, select the check boxes to assign the app to different 
user profiles.
You want to make sure that the right apps are available to the right people in 
your organization.
8.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Apps page reappears, and your new custom app now appears in the list.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      311
Creating custom tabs
With Force.com, you can create two primary types of custom tabs: custom object 
tabs and web tabs. They look just like the standard tabs that your users already 
use, and you can build the tabs in less than a minute — piece o’ cake.
Adding a tab to a custom object
If you read through the section “Building your custom objects,” earlier in this 
chapter, you’ve probably already built a custom tab. Sometimes, however, you 
build a custom object and decide later to add the tab.
Don’t over-tab your application if it’s not necessary. Ask yourself: “Will my users 
need all the object’s data available from a central area?” If the answer is yes, you 
may need a custom tab.
To build a custom tab, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Tabs.
The Custom Tabs page appears.
2.	 Click New in the Custom Objects Tab related list.
3.	 In Step 1 of the New Custom Object Tab Wizard, select the object from the 
picklist, and then use the Lookup icon to choose a tab style.
The tab style affects both the color of the tab and the icon associated with a 
custom object record under Recent Items.
4.	 In Step 2 of the wizard, select the desired tab visibility for your user profiles.
With the radio button feature, you can control tab visibility of your profiles.
5.	 In Step 3 of the wizard, select the apps to which the new custom tab will be 
available.
This step makes it simple to associate custom tabs with just the right apps for 
your users.
6.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Custom Tabs page reappears with your new custom tab listed.
Building a web tab
In the normal course of a day, your users frequent other websites as part of their 
jobs — to access an intranet, to arrange travel plans, to use an internal web-based 
application. . . . The list goes on. Why not make it easier for users to get to your 

312      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
business-related sites? With Force.com, you can build web tabs that access web 
applications and Visualforce.
We don’t go into the details of Apex code or Visualforce because they require cod-
ing, but imagine that you have a particular form to which your teams are emo-
tionally attached (a client profile form with four columns, for example). With 
Visualforce and the help of an experienced developer, you can display your data in 
Salesforce in unique formats and keep everyone happy. To manage these features, 
choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Develop.
To create a simple web tab, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Build ➪ Create ➪ Tabs.
The Custom Tabs page appears.
2.	 Click the New button in the Web Tabs related list.
3.	 In Step 1 of the New Web Tab Wizard, click a button to select a layout.
4.	 In Step 2 of the wizard, define the display properties for the content, and 
then click Next.
In this example, we show you how to create a URL-based web tab for news 
labeled News. Select a Tab Type to tell Salesforce if this tab’s content is coming 
from a URL or a dynamically generated URL. Type in a relevant Tab Label and 
choose a Tab Style.
5.	 In Step 3 of the wizard, enter a URL, add any additional merge fields, and 
then click Next.
Embedding merge fields is easy after you get the hang of it. For example, this 
URL is the standard search results URL from CNN:
http://http://www.cnn.com/search/?text=salesforce
We copied and pasted the URL in the Button or Link URL box. Then we used 
the merge field tool for {!Org_Name} and put that in place of salesforce in 
the URL so it looked like this:
http://www.cnn.com/search/?text={!Org_Name}
6.	 In Step 4 of the wizard, click the drop-down lists to control which user 
profiles can access the tab, and then click Next.
7.	 In Step 5 of the wizard, check the box next to whichever custom apps you 
want to contain this web tab, and then click Save.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      313
Understanding the AppExchange
As customers, employees, and partners began building custom applications (or 
apps), some bright person came up with an idea: Wouldn’t it be great if other cus-
tomers like you could simply try, download, and install these custom apps without 
having to build them on their own? iTunes uses the web to distribute music, so 
why shouldn’t enterprise applications work the same way?
Enter AppExchange, the website owned and operated by Salesforce.com where you 
can try, download, and quickly install apps that can extend the value of Salesforce 
to meet your unique needs. You can even use the AppExchange to share your cus-
tom apps.
Of course, the biggest benefit beyond how much easier your life will be is the 
impact on your users. The AppExchange marketplace isn’t just about easy 
­sharing — it’s about your employees using integrated business apps with all your 
information in one place.
Customers, partners, and Salesforce.com personnel can all provide AppExchange 
with applications. Many of them, particularly the ones published by Salesforce.
com employees (a.k.a. Salesforce Labs), are free to install and use. Others, such as 
the ones provided by partners, may have a fee associated with them.
Downloading music and videos from the web is something we take for granted 
nowadays. But downloading enterprise apps? Wow, that seems like a whole 
’nother animal.
Yet, when you get down to it, AppExchange is still about the exchange of a package 
of goods from one party to another. As with many innovations, getting the most 
out of a new system usually amounts to understanding some basic terms and 
knowing your limits before jumping in.
Here are a few key terms you should know before you get started:
»
» Installation: The process by which you download, install, and deploy a 
custom app from AppExchange.
»
» Publishing: The process by which you package a portion of your customiza-
tions and make them available, either publicly or privately, on AppExchange.
»
» Managed package: An AppExchange package created and maintained by a 
verified third-party vendor. Unlike unmanaged packages, whose components 
you can modify and customize, managed package components have limited 
customization capabilities. This allows vendors to provide you with an 
upgrade path that’ll leave you successful instead of stuck in the mud because 
you changed something that’s not supported by a newer version.

314      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
And here are a few more things to keep in mind:
»
» Although anyone can try out the AppExchange, to install and share apps, you 
must have a Salesforce instance and have administrative rights to that 
instance. (Did we just hear a sigh of relief?)
»
» You can publish many types of AppExchange components, not just custom 
apps, on AppExchange. You can exchange custom links, dashboards, 
Visualforce code snippets, and more.
»
» Some apps are self-contained — native — in Salesforce. They were built with 
Force.com and don’t depend on other external applications. Other custom 
apps are composite. Such apps may look and feel like Salesforce apps but 
connect with other services not owned by Salesforce.com. Caveat emptor (let 
the buyer beware).
Familiarize yourself with AppExchange at www.appexchange.com, and then try 
out some apps before you decide whether you want to use them.
If you want to install a custom prebuilt app, you can do it with a few simple clicks. 
This process amounts to downloading the package, installing the app into your 
instance of Salesforce, and deploying it to all or a portion of your users.
A package refers to all the components that make up the custom app. A package 
may include custom tabs and objects, custom links, custom profiles, reports, 
dashboards, documents, and more.
To install a custom app, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Get It Now button on the app’s detail page in AppExchange (at 
www.appexchange.com).
2.	 Click the Log In to the AppExchange button to log in using your Salesforce 
credentials.
This identifies who you are. If you’ve already got Salesforce open in another tab 
in your browser, you’ll move to the next step. Make sure you enter the 
information that reflects which org you want to install the app into.
3.	 Choose whether you want to continue the installation of the app in your 
production or sandbox.
Larger organizations may have customizations that need to be tested with this 
package. A sandbox that is practically an exact copy of what you have in your 
live system is a good place to kick the tires without the potential of impacting 
your business if something goes wrong.

CHAPTER 19  Building Custom Apps      315
If you don’t have access to a sandbox, install the app in your production 
environment, but make sure you make it visible just to system administrators 
first until they’ve thoroughly tested the installation.
4.	Review the list that appears, which tells you what you’ll be installing and 
where.
Salesforce makes this as transparent an installation as possible. You can see if 
the app is free or not, what the subscription model is, and where it’s being 
installed.
5.	Check the box to confirm that you’ve read the terms and conditions, and 
then click the Confirm and Install button to continue.
6.	Enter your Salesforce login and password again for the org in which you want 
to install the app.
The Package Installation Details page appears in Salesforce.
If you’re experimenting with the AppExchange for the first time, you may want 
to consider using the Sandbox Edition or a free Developer Edition instance to 
install, customize, and test the custom app.
7.	Examine the details of what’s getting installed by clicking the View 
Components link and the API Access link.
This page summarizes the custom app’s details, including objects, fields, tabs, 
reports, and dashboards.
Make sure that you examine the contents of a package thoroughly before 
proceeding. Understand the package’s API access to various objects, including 
details of what permissions the package will have on what objects.
8.	Select a radio button to choose the audience that you’ll be installing this 
package for: admins only, all users, or certain profiles.
We recommend that you start with first testing this out to admins only. Then 
you can think about who has access to edit and view the contents of the app 
before you’re ready to deploy it live. If you want to install the app for select 
profiles, the Select Specific Profiles details appear on the same page.
9.	Specify the level of access for each profile.
The access levels here determine the layout assignments, field-level security, 
and other fun stuff such as editing permissions for the custom objects in the 
package. Access levels set here don’t affect those of any existing objects you 
have. Determine which profiles have no access or full access.
10.	Click the Install button.
A progress page appears as installation begins. An Install Complete page 
appears after the installation finishes. Bet your traditional software can’t create 
a whole new app that fast!

316      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
11.	Click Done.
At this point, you can choose to deploy the app immediately to users or further 
customize it. We suggest that you click OK to confirm the download and begin 
prepping some dummy data before you deploy this to users.
The Installed Packages page appears. If you check out the upper-right corner, 
you’ll notice that the Force.com Apps menu now contains a listing for your 
new app.
After you install the app, you can use Force.com to modify its tabs, objects, and 
other customizations, just as though you had built the custom app yourself. Even 
though you’ve installed the app as we recommend in Step 8 earlier, it’s not avail-
able to nonadministrators until it’s deployed.

Getting acquainted with the 
Lightning Experience user interface
Deciding whether the Lightning 
Experience is right for your company
Preparing to switch to the Lightning 
Experience
Introducing the 
Lightning Experience
S
alesforce has been struck by lightning! No, not really, silly. But figuratively, 
its new Lightning branding describes several new or revamped features that 
provide a more modern visual experience for users used to the look and feel 
of common consumer-like apps like Twitter and Facebook. Lightning features are 
also built to more easily adapt to how information is displayed and interacted with 
on tablets and mobile devices. More Salesforce users will be experiencing the tool 
on devices other than the web browser on a computer, and Salesforce wants to 
empower administrators to build solutions that are compatible with an increas-
ingly mobile workforce.
In this chapter, we provide an overview of the Lightning Experience, which pro-
vides a different end-user experience from the one that has evolved more than 
15 years ago when Salesforce first debuted. The changes are relevant most notice-
ably on the home page, object home pages, records, and reports and dashboards. 
The look and feel that is the default interface, and that we display in the rest of 
this book’s figures, is called Salesforce Classic.
As of the publication of this book, the Lightning Experience and its compatibility 
with Salesforce Classic customizations continues to evolve. In this chapter, we tell 
you where you should go for more information to help assess if your company is 
ready to make use of the Lightning Experience. If the answer is yes, we help you 
prepare to make that leap.

Navigating the Lightning  
Experience Interface
In this section, we highlight what an end-user sees when he logs in to a Salesforce 
instance that’s chosen the Lightning Experience user interface.
Walking through the home page
The Lightning Experience was designed after extensive research and feedback 
from Salesforce’s user base. The majority of Salesforce’s primary users are part of 
some sales function, so this revamp focuses heavily on providing concise infor-
mation to a more sales-oriented user.
When you first log in to Salesforce, you see the home page, as usual. However 
you’ll know when you’re in the Lightning Experience because the navigation 
menu that takes you to other objects is on the left side of the browser, as showing 
in Figure 20-1.
The Global Search bar prominently appears in the top center of the page, so you 
can easily find records. Also, when you move your cursor into the search bar and 
click, a list of your most recently accessed records shows up, as shown in 
Figure 20-2.
FIGURE 20-1:  
The home page in 
the Lightning 
Experience.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      319
The right-side of the home page is where the Assistant lives. This right sidebar 
area serves up records based on several criteria, including those that have past due 
dates, activities to address today (like contacting a Lead), and Opportunities that 
are scheduled to close in the future, or ones that haven’t had any interaction with 
you in a while. It’s meant as a place to quickly understand which activities and 
deals you should focus on.
The top-middle portion of your home page is taken up by a very noticeable quar-
terly performance chart. This gives you a quick visualization of your goal this 
quarter, the amount of money you’ve already closed, which ones are still open 
with a greater than 70 percent chance of successfully closing this quarter, and 
your total potential upside.
Below the quarterly performance chart is the Account Insights area, which can 
provide quick news highlights about accounts relevant to you. The information is 
aggregated by Data.com.
Below the Account Insights section are two final sections, Recent Records and Top 
Deals, as shown in Figure 20-3. Recent Records provides a shortcut to your most 
recently accessed records. Top Deals helps a seller (or sales manager) remember 
her top potential moneymaking opportunities, so she can better focus her sales 
activities.

Monitoring activities on a record
When you click a record, you see its details and any activities or collaborative dis-
cussions related to that record. Consider this a workspace for this record, from 
where you can manage all interactions. The presentation of a record’s details begins 
with highlights about a record, in the top portion of the page. In Figure 20-4, you 
see an example of an Opportunity detail record, with basic information on the top.
The next section might be the Sales Path, which is unique to Lead and Opportunity 
records, and which we discuss later in this chapter. For now, we focus on the other 
sections that foster driving action.
On any detail record page, you see information grouped initially in three ­buckets — 
Activity, Collaborate, and Details — to reduce the amount of vertical page scrolling 
to get to the most pertinent information. Depending on the type of record, these 
sections may be in the main part of a detail page or in the right-hand column. The 
behavior will be consistent across objects, and that’s what we want you to learn.
The Collaborate section is where your collaborative Chatter feed interactions 
appear (see Chapter 6 for more information on Chatter). The Details section dis-
plays more fields related to this specific record. The Activity section is the default 
one that appears, with a subset of composer tabs below it that allow you to imme-
diately compose activities related to this record, like log a call, create a new task 
or event, or send an email.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      321
When you’re working in Salesforce, it should be about driving action to move a 
deal forward. The things you’re logging in Salesforce should correlate to that.
Below the Activity section, you see the activity timeline. This includes tasks and 
events that haven’t been completed yet and are grouped under the Next Steps 
area. Below that is a Past Activity section, which shows your activity history or 
previous actions taken.
Tracking all your deals on the  
Opportunity kanban board
Lightning Experience provides an option to display your Opportunity list views in 
the format of a columnar kanban board, where each column represents a certain 
Opportunity stage and applicable deals in that stage.
Kanban refers to an engineering process originally used in Japan by Toyota that 
optimized inventory levels. The general system of moving a card through various 
stages, represented visually by columns, until its completion, has been adopted in 
other industries because it provides a visualization of progressing to a goal.

322      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
To visualize your opportunities on a kanban board, as shown in Figure  20-5, 
­follow these steps:
1.	 From the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, click 
Opportunities.
A list of recently viewed Opportunities appears.
2.	 Click the downward-pointing triangle to the right of the Recently Viewed 
Opportunities list name.
A list of standard and custom list views appears.
3.	 Select a list view so that it displays on the screen.
4.	 On the right side of the list view header area, click the icon that looks like a 
small grid.
The Display As drop-down list appears.
5.	 Select Board from the Display As drop-down list.
The list view changes to a kanban board, where each opportunity is repre-
sented as a card, nested under its current Opportunity stage. The board also 
shows a summary of all Opportunity Amounts for that particular stage.
6.	 (Optional) Move an Opportunity to a different stage by hovering over its 
card, and then clicking and dragging it to its updated column.
The Opportunity’s stage is updated, and the sum of the Opportunity Amounts 
in the affected columns changes to reflect the move.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      323
Accessing apps with the App Launcher
In the upper-right corner of any Lightning Experience page is a small icon that 
looks like a 3 x 3 gray grid. That’s the App Launcher icon. Clicking the App Launcher 
icon takes you to the App Launcher page, shown in Figure 20-6, which shows all 
the various apps that your Salesforce instance has installed.
Apps in Salesforce can mean a collection of custom objects that you’ve chosen to 
group together, or that have been provided by a third-party via the AppExchange. 
For more information on creating custom apps, check out Chapter 19.
You can click and drag an app “card” so the cards are displayed in an order that 
represents the apps that you access most frequently.
Clicking an app card shows the brief description of the app, and then the various 
object names grouped under it, which you can also click to get to that object’s 
home page. Also, because the Lightning Experience continues to evolve, this app 
page will specify which objects are not yet supported within the Lightning Experi-
ence’s look and feel. Clicking those not-yet-supported objects will open a new 
browser tab, in the Salesforce Classic display, so you can still continue to be 
productive.

Considering Lightning for  
Your Organization
You may be hearing all this talk about the Lightning Experience, while your com-
pany currently uses Salesforce and lives in the Salesforce Classic world. At some 
point, people may be looking to you for your opinion on whether Lightning Expe-
rience is the magic bullet for your organization.
In this section, we discuss what you should evaluate in order to make some edu-
cated decisions at your company.
Comparing the Lightning Experience  
to Salesforce Classic
In this section, we cover some key differences between the Lightning Experience 
and Salesforce Classic. Over time, there may be more differences as Salesforce.
com pours more effort into enhancements within the Lightning Experience, but 
here are some fundamental differences as of this writing:
»
» The home page has been updated. The navigation options have moved to 
the left of the screen, the main focus of the page is on the quarterly perfor-
mance chart, and the Calendar and My Tasks sections have been consolidated 
and replaced by the Assistant. The experience today is deliberately focused on 
a user with sales responsibilities.
»
» Home page tabs have moved. The navigation to various objects used to look 
like tabs, and then over time looked like headings, but the tab name always 
stuck around. Whatever you call them, they’ve now moved to the left of the 
screen, where the object name can be reduced to just its icon, and the 
navigation bar’s width can shrink, too, to allow the most efficient use of your 
browser window.
»
» The Chatter feed is now nested in its own subsection. In Salesforce Classic, 
the Chatter feed is at the top of the record’s page. Lots of collaboration can 
turn into lots of posts that users have to scroll past to get to the record details. 
In the Lightning Experience, the Chatter feed is tucked within the Collaborate 
subtab, which is accessible from the “top of the fold” view in a browser. The 
feed’s details are just a click away if you want to see them, and not taking up 
valuable visual real estate otherwise. See Figure 20-7 for an example of the 
Collaborate subtab on an Opportunity record.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      325
»
» Record details are now nested in their own subsection. Similar to the 
Chatter feed, a record’s details can often span many pages. A record’s details 
are nested under a Details subtab.
»
» Sales Path provides guidance on Leads and Opportunities. To help coach 
users within a sales organization and foster proper usage of Salesforce, leads 
and opportunities can now offer a Sales Path. This gives sales trainers and 
managers a narrative of what a user should accomplish in a particular stage of 
his process. This can include what fields should be filled out, instructions, and 
links to resources. Of course, this means your business has to have some 
business process to reflect within the system! For an example of a Sales Path 
item, see Figure 20-8.
The Lightning Experience will continue to evolve and more features will be sup-
ported in this user interface. Because Salesforce.com averages three updates a 
year to its product, a lot can happen within a year! To stay up to date on what 
features are supported, click Help from the upper-right section of your Salesforce 
Classic interface. Search for the keywords compare Lightning Experience and Sales-
force Classic for a grid of features by object, and what’s supported in each.

326      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Assessing your organization’s readiness
The devil’s in the details, and you should be familiar with your organization’s 
configuration before diving in deeper.
Primarily, the Lightning Experience is focused on making your sales users even 
more efficient. If you have a lot of users outside of sales that are heavy users of 
Salesforce, consider their experience if you were to debut the Lightning Experi-
ence to your sales users.
Also consider how defined your business processes are today. If your sales reps 
aren’t expected to log calls or activities, and they’re not being too consistent with 
when they’re adding opportunities or updating their stages, the Lightning Experi-
ence’s benefits may not be fully realized by your users.
Does your Salesforce instance use a lot of custom code? You’ll need to have your 
developers confirm if what they’ve built is supported in the Lightning Experience. 
This area is evolving quickly, so it’s best to check the Salesforce Release Notes to 
confirm.
Planning Your Lightning Deployment
If you think your organization is ready to convert to the Lightning Experience, 
you’ll want to ensure you have some processes confirmed first in order to make 
use of the user interface. In this section, we discuss a few areas that, with a little 
planning, can prepare your users for a richer experience when they join the Light-
ning Experience.
Determining sales path tips
Though training your new sales reps can help them sell more productively, many 
companies don’t invest in a person or people to help with sales learning and 
development. Sometimes this is due to companies not having a disciplined sales 
process to teach their salespeople. Other times, a process may be in place, but sales 
management doesn’t believe in it and, thus, doesn’t support reps’ adherence to it.
Though the Sales Path feature in the Lightning Experience won’t magically create 
a business process for you, you can time the enabling of Lightning Experience 
with sales training on a new process.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      327
You’ll want to define the names of your sales stages, and list expectations of what 
milestones are accomplished at each stage. Are there specific fields that need to be 
filled out before progressing to the next stage of the opportunity life cycle? Is 
there access to presentation templates or marketing material applicable to that 
stage? Map all those out so you can reflect them in the Sales Path.
Because this feature is also available for the lead life cycle, you can also collect 
processes and steps for your inside sales or sales development teams.
Benefitting from account insights
What are the approximate sizes of the typical companies that buy your products? 
Are they Fortune 500 companies publicly traded on a U.S. stock exchange? Are 
they small private businesses, or perhaps private companies that make as much 
revenue as some public-company peers?
The answers here will be unique for your business, and can determine if you 
enable the Account Insights functionality. Larger companies that get reported on 
in the news will show up in this section; the mom-and-pop shop down the street 
probably won’t (unless it comes up with a social media campaign that goes viral).
Choosing a pilot group
If you’re still a bit hesitant about rolling out the Lightning Experience to your 
organization all at once, nominate a sales team to act as your pilot group. People 
naturally feel uncomfortable with change, so taking baby steps in your organiza-
tion can allow you to take a more measured approach to deployment. With a 
smaller set of initial adoptees, you’ll be able to gather feedback and provide more 
focused help to users, so the transition doesn’t seem so intimidating.
Turning on the Lightning Experience
Now that you’ve gathered all your processes, and you’ve identified your pilot 
group, it’s time to turn on the Lightning Experience. This section walks you 
through how to enable this from the Salesforce Classic user interface.
To enable the Lightning Experience, do the following:
1.	 Click Setup in the upper-right corner.
The Force.com home page appears.

328      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
2.	 Click Lightning Experience in the left sidebar.
If you don’t see Lightning Experience, type the phrase Lightning Experience in 
the Quick Find/Search bar that appears at the top of the left sidebar.
The Lightning Experience home page appears.
3.	 In the Enable These Recommended Features First section, review the 
features mentioned and enable or set up any that are listed.
Make sure you’ve reviewed any feature’s Tell Me More link first, and that you’ve 
collected information from your stakeholders on relevant business processes 
that may need to be mapped into the tool.
4.	 In the Decide Who Can Use Lightning Experience section, click Set Up 
Permissions if you want to pilot this to a subset of users.
The Permission Sets page appears where you can create a permission set to 
apply to any user who will be using the Lightning Experience. For more 
information on permission sets, make sure to go online to www.dummies.
com/extras/salesforcedotcom to read our Web Extra on this topic.
5.	 In the Enable the New Salesforce Experience section, toggle the Lightning 
Experience slider to the right, where the label will change from Disabled to 
Enabled.
6.	 Click the Setup link.
You’ll see a progress page as you magically transform to the new experience.
Switching between the Lightning  
Experience and Salesforce Classic
Now that you’re in the Lightning Experience, what if you change your mind and 
want to go back to the Salesforce Classic world? In the old days before Salesforce 
and the cloud, anyone asking this would get a raised eyebrow and a gentle “deal 
with it” response from her IT department.
Fortunately, the folks at Salesforce.com remember the pain of those old days, and 
they’ve worked to ensure that users in the Lightning Experience can quickly 
change back to the Salesforce Classic user interface if desired.
To switch from the Lightning Experience to Salesforce Classic, do the following 
from the Force.com home page:
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the page, click the far-right icon that rep-
resents you.
If you’ve got a Chatter profile photo uploaded, that’ll be what you see.

CHAPTER 20  Introducing the Lightning Experience      329
Your username shows up, along with links to your profile and personal 
settings. You’ll also see a link to switch to Salesforce Classic, as shown in 
Figure 20-9.
2.	 Click Switch to Salesforce Classic.
Your Salesforce Classic home page appears.

Accessing the Right 
Data with User 
Permissions
H
ow can Salesforce be customized for your company so each user sees only 
pertinent information? You’ve come to the right chapter.
For administrators or members of your customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) project team with the right privileges, Salesforce allows you to easily 
configure your system so that users can access and share information according 
to your goals. With Salesforce, you have a variety of ways to control access and 
sharing of data, from system-wide sharing rules to assigning profiles. And, if you 
have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, you have industrial-strength flexibility, 
even to the point of field-level security.
In this chapter, we show you all the steps you can take (or should consider) for 
configuring Salesforce to ensure that users see only what they need to see. We 
discuss concepts around creating the role hierarchy, assigning profiles, determin-
ing field-level security, creating users, and setting up your sharing rules.
Chapter 21

332      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Understanding User Administration
When Salesforce.com supplies user licenses for your organization, administrators 
can add users into Salesforce. You don’t have to create the roles and profiles before 
you add users, but we recommend doing so because Role and Profile are important 
fields when you’re creating a user record. In this section, we discuss various ways 
of creating users and managing them.
Not sure what roles and profiles are, but want to get started quickly? At least 
review the “Defining the Role Hierarchy” and “Reviewing the standard profiles” 
sections later in this chapter, so you understand what the out-of-the-box 
­permissions allow.
Creating a new user
To add users, click the Setup link and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Users link under the Administer ➪ Manage Users heading on 
the sidebar.
A users list page appears.
2.	 (Optional) Use the View drop-down list if you want to select from standard or 
custom list views of your users.
Salesforce presets your views with three standard options: All Users, Active 
Users, and Admin Users.
3.	 Click the New User button to add users one at a time.
A New User page appears in Edit mode.
To enter a list of users that need to be created (instead of one at a time), click 
the Add Multiple Users button instead.
4.	 Complete the fields, paying close attention to selecting appropriate Role and 
Profile values.
Select the Generate New Password and Notify User Immediately check box at 
the bottom of the New User page if you want the user to immediately receive 
an email with her username and temporary password. If you’re in the midst of 
an implementation, we recommend deselecting this check box and doling out 
passwords when you’re good and ready.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      333
If your company is just starting out with Salesforce, be cautious and don’t give 
all your new users the System Administrator profile. Future generations of 
users at your company will thank you for taking a prudent approach to 
configuring things in Salesforce, as opposed to allowing too many cooks into 
the Salesforce kitchen.
5.	 Click Save.
The User detail page appears.
Activating and deactivating users
After you’ve created a new user, you can activate or deactivate him. Activation 
means the user is able to log in to Salesforce and start using it. Deactivation 
means, well, the opposite. There is no concept of deleting a user, which helps 
with compliance and auditing purposes, as well as avoiding a lot of complications 
when it comes to historical records owned by and actions performed by that user.
To activate or deactivate a user, click the Setup link and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Users link under the Administer ➪ Manage Users heading on 
the sidebar.
A users list page appears.
2.	 Click the Edit link to the left of a user’s name.
The User Edit detail page appears for that user.
3.	 Check the Active box, depending on what you want to do.
If you see a checkmark, that means the user is active. Removing the checkmark 
means that user is deactivated.
4.	 Click Save to save your action.
You’re returned to the user list page.
Freezing users
What if the user you’re trying to deactivate is associated with some special ­settings 
in Salesforce (like being a default lead or queue owner)? This may take some time 
as you confirm with business users who the replacement assignee should be. In 
the meantime, the clock is ticking and you still need to prevent this user from 
accessing Salesforce. That’s when you can freeze a user’s record, which disables 
that user’s ability to access Salesforce while you perform related system adminis-
trator duties.

334      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
To freeze a user, click the Setup link and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Users link under the Administer ➪ Manage Users heading on 
the sidebar.
A users list page appears.
2.	 Click the name of the user you want to freeze.
The user’s detail page appears.
3.	 Click the Freeze button.
You’re returned to the user detail page, and the button name changes to 
Unfreeze. To unfreeze that user record, click the Unfreeze button.
Establishing Data Access Concepts
Before jumping into the guts of system design, take a minute to review five basic 
configuration elements. These will help as you begin to think about who in your 
company should see and edit what in Salesforce.
»
» Users: These are the specific people who use your Salesforce system.
»
» Sharing model: Defines the baseline, general access that users have to each 
other’s data. Also known as organization-wide defaults, org-wide defaults, or 
simply, OWDs. If you already know that certain groups should not be seeing 
other groups’ information, you want to start with the most restrictive sharing 
model and use things like the role hierarchy and sharing rules to open access 
to information. It’s easier to provide more access than it is to selectively 
restrict it.
»
» Roles and role hierarchy: Define who reports to whom in your organization, 
for the purposes of seeing and editing information owned by others, which 
aids in running reports. Think of roles as a way to provide vertical access to 
data (that is, up and down a hierarchy). People higher up in the hierarchy are 
able to report on those below them in the hierarchy. For example, if you’re a 
manager of a team of sales reps, you’ll have a role above your team and be 
able to see all the account, contact, and opportunity data owned by your 
team. Individual sales reps, however, may not be able to see opportunity 
information owned by their peers. This doesn’t always have to mimic your 
company’s org chart exactly, however. Another example is that a sales 
operations analyst may not have any direct reports, but must run reports on 
the entire sales team. This person could share a role with the head of sales, 
only because of her reporting needs. Each user should have an assigned role 
within your defined role hierarchy.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      335
PLANNING USER ACCESS  
TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS
Put the major stakeholders of your Salesforce solution in a room and ask them one 
question: “How do you envision people sharing information in Salesforce?” More often 
than not, you’ll get blank stares.
Discuss sharing issues with your CRM project team after you hear about their current 
CRM processes. Current business processes, explained without any Salesforce jargon 
from the team, can often help you formulate an opinion based on what you believe 
would be best for your company. Take into consideration the culture, size, and type of 
sales organization at your company. Use this opinion to guide the specific nature of 
your questions.
Now, you should ask that question, but we suggest following it up with scenarios. Here 
are a few ideas to get you started:
•	 Should a sales development rep be able to see what the CEO sees?
•	 Should a sales rep be able to view data from other reps? Should one sales rep be 
allowed to edit another’s lead record?
•	 Do certain groups need wider access than others? For example, does a call center 
team that supports all customers need more or less access than a team of sales 
reps? What about a professional services team member who helps during the sales 
cycle, as well as during the implementation, and answers any postlaunch questions 
for up to a certain number of days?
•	 Do you have marketing operations or sales operations staff? How will they be 
­interacting with Salesforce? Should they be able to see everything that VPs of their 
organizations see, especially because they’ll probably be doing all the legwork for 
them?
•	 Does a manager require different permissions than a rep, to change information 
that the rep can’t?
•	 Do multiple people commonly work on the same account or opportunity?
•	 Do you have any compliance or audit concerns with a fully open or completely 
­private sharing model?
Use these types of questions and their answers to guide your configuration.

336      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
»
» Profiles: Control a user’s capability to see and access different fields within a 
record in Salesforce. For example, service reps will find some fields on an 
account record more relevant than other fields that may be very important to 
a marketing operations analyst. To make the service reps’ view of the account 
record more pertinent and less confusing, you could hide certain irrelevant 
fields from their view by assigning them a custom profile. You must assign a 
profile to each user.
»
» Sharing rules: Opens up access to data for specific users or groups of users. 
Think of this as opening lateral or horizontal access to your data, by giving 
certain peer groups or individuals this exception.
You use these five elements as the primary levers to deliver the proper level of 
access and control for your company in Salesforce.
Defining Your Sharing Model
As an administrator or member of your CRM project team, one of your biggest 
decisions in Salesforce is how users will share information. A sharing model 
­controls the level of access that users have across an organization’s information, 
not just up and down the chain. You can use the sharing model with the role hier-
archy, public groups, personal groups, and the default access for each role to get 
pretty specific about what you want people to view or change. You use the 
­organization-wide sharing model and, if necessary, public groups and expanded 
sharing rules in Salesforce to configure your sharing model.
For smaller, younger organizations, start with an open, collaborative sharing 
model, as opposed to a secretive sharing model in which no one knows what 
anyone else is doing. (A secretive sharing model sounds like any oxymoron, 
right? Well, it can be because if you don’t carefully think about ramifications, you 
could be back to where you started with giant heaps of information.) If collabora-
tion is one of your goals, a more-restrictive sharing model can have a greater 
potential negative impact on end-user adoption. You can always change the 
sharing model in the future if people scream loudly enough. But nine times out 
of ten, the value of collaboration overcomes the initial concerns with users view-
ing other users’ data.
Setting organization-wide defaults
The organization-wide defaults (OWDs) set the default sharing access that users 
have to each other’s data. Sharing access determines how data created by users in 
a certain role or public group is viewed by users within another role or public 

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      337
group. For example, you many want your sales operations team to see the dollar 
value of won opportunities so that they can verify what was booked versus what’s 
listed on the signed contract, but you probably don’t want them editing the amount 
of that won opportunity. If any role or public group possesses data that at least one 
other role or group shouldn’t see, your sharing model must be private; all other 
levels of openness must be granted as an exception via groups (more on that later).
No matter which defaults you set to the sharing model, users will still have access 
to all data owned by or shared with users below them in the role hierarchy.
To configure the organization-wide defaults, click the Setup link and follow these 
steps:
1.	 Choose Administer ➪ Security Controls ➪ Sharing Settings.
The Sharing Settings page appears, showing org-wide defaults for several 
objects, as well as specific sharing rules for those objects.
2.	 Click the Edit button in the Organization Wide Defaults list.
The Organization Sharing Edit page appears.
3.	 Select the desired settings.
Click some picklists to see the different options. The options are typically 
Private, Public Read Only, and Public Read/Write. Some objects may have 
options specific to that object’s functionality, like the Calendar object, and the 
ability you have to set how much information people can see on others’ 
calendars. For example, if you want the most restrictive model, choose the 
following as your defaults: Private for the major records and Hide Details for 
Calendar. Some standard objects, like the Lead and Case objects, have extra-
special powers and have an additional option, Public Read/Write/Transfer. This 
assumes that someone working heavily in leads or cases will often need to 
transfer a lead or case record that isn’t owned by him to someone else.
Remember what we said about role hierarchy providing “vertical access” to 
data? A Private sharing setting on an object still assumes that people with a 
role above yours in the role hierarchy can see and report on those records. 
Salesforce always, by default, respects the hierarchy structure — sharing 
settings determine only how peers and those outside your typical chain of 
command see your data. For more complex sharing scenarios, you can have 
the option to deselect the ability to grant access to records based on role 
hierarchy, but, you may want to consult with Salesforce support or a Salesforce 
Partner before making such a complex change.
4.	 Click Save.
The Sharing Settings page reappears with your settings listed under the 
Organization Wide Defaults list.

338      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Granting greater access with sharing rules
By using public groups, roles, or roles and subordinates, you can create sharing 
rules to extend access above and beyond the organization-wide defaults. For 
example, if your default sharing model is read-only but you want a group of call 
center agents to have edit privileges on account records, you could do this with a 
custom sharing rule.
To add a sharing rule and apply it to your data, click the Setup link and follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click the Sharing Settings link under the Administer ➪ Security Controls 
heading on the sidebar.
The Sharing Settings page appears.
2.	 Scroll down and click the New button next to any of the standard or custom 
object Sharing Rules lists, as shown in Figure 21-1.
All lists operate much the same but relate to different records. A Sharing Rule 
setup page appears for your selected record.
FIGURE 21-1:  
Adding a new 
sharing rule.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      339
3.	 Use the drop-down lists to define the data you want to share and the  
related roles or groups that you want to share that data with, as shown in 
Figure 21-2.
For example, you may want to grant your customer support team read/write 
privileges to account data owned by all internal users. You can apply the 
sharing rule based on types of users who own the record, or create other filter 
criteria.
4.	 Click Save.
The Sharing Settings page reappears with your new rule listed under the 
appropriate related list.
When you add a new sharing rule, Salesforce automatically reevaluates the shar-
ing rules to apply the changes to all your records. If your modifications are sub-
stantial, you’ll be warned with a dialog box that the operation could take significant 
time, and Salesforce will email you when complete. When you click OK, the dialog 
box closes, and the Sharing Settings page reappears. Use the Recalculate button in 
the appropriate related list to manually apply the changes when you’ve made 
modifications to groups, roles, or territories.
FIGURE 21-2:  
Showing a 
sharing rule.

340      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Setting Up Profiles
In Enterprise and Unlimited editions of Salesforce, you can use profiles to control 
a user’s permission to view and perform many functions. Roles and sharing rules 
determine which objects a person sees, and whether she can make changes to that 
object. A profile determines what details a person sees on that object. Depending 
on which edition you’re using, you can use profiles to
»
» Define which page layouts a user will see
»
» Control field-level access
»
» Determine the apps viewed by a user
»
» Alter the tabs displayed to users
»
» Make record types available to certain users
»
» Secure certain login settings
Reviewing the standard profiles
Most editions of Salesforce come with five or six standard profiles, which can’t be 
altered except for the tab settings. The number of standard profiles may differ 
depending on the types of Salesforce licenses your organization has purchased. 
Newer organizations can stick to standard profiles and address their company’s 
basic requirements related to user access. If you have Group or Professional Edi-
tion, you can’t actually view the settings on the standard profiles.
If you have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪  Manage 
Users ➪ Profiles to see your profiles. Otherwise, here’s a brief explanation of the 
more common standard profiles for Salesforce license types and how they’re typi-
cally applied:
»
» System administrators have full permissions and access across all Salesforce 
functions that don’t require a separate license. You’d typically grant this level 
of control only to users administering the system or who play a critical part in 
configuring and customizing Salesforce.
»
» Standard users can create and edit most record types, run reports, and view 
but not modify many areas of the administration setup. If you can’t create 
custom profiles, you’d probably choose to assign sales reps to the standard 
user profile.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      341
»
» Solution managers have all the rights of standard users and can review and 
publish solutions.
»
» Marketing users have all the rights of standard users and can perform a 
variety of marketing-related functions, including importing leads and manag-
ing public documents and email templates. If your Salesforce edition has 
campaigns, marketing users can also administer campaigns.
»
» Contract managers can add, edit, approve, and activate contracts. They can 
also delete nonactivated contracts.
»
» Read only is just what its name implies. Users assigned to this profile can 
view data and export reports but can’t edit anything.
Profiles never conflict with your organization’s sharing model or role hierarchy. 
For example, a Standard User profile allows a user to create, edit, or delete leads, 
but if your sharing model is read-only for leads, the Standard User won’t be able 
to delete leads owned by others.
Over the years, Salesforce.com has expanded the types of licenses you can buy, to 
better accommodate your organization’s users and how often and what they need 
to access in Salesforce. To get the latest comprehensive list with definitions, click 
the Help link from within any Salesforce page and type license types into the 
search bar.
Creating custom profiles
If you have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, you can build custom profiles that pro-
vide you greater flexibility than the standard permissions granted to users and the 
layouts that they see. For example, you may want to create a custom profile for your 
finance team so that only users with that profile can edit check boxes on the oppor-
tunity that track whether certain signed forms have been submitted when you close 
a deal. See Chapter 17 for details on creating custom layouts and record types.
To create a custom profile, you can start from scratch, but we suggest cloning and 
modifying an existing profile by following these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Manage Users ➪ Profiles.
The User Profiles page appears. You can see which profiles are standard or 
custom ones based on which ones have the Custom box checked.
2.	 Click the Standard User link in the Profile Name list.
The Profile: Standard User page appears. In practice, you can clone from any of 
the profiles, but by starting from the Standard User profile, you can simply add 
or remove permissions.

342      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
3.	 Click the Clone button.
The Clone Profile page appears.
4.	 Type a title in the Profile Name field and then click Save.
The Profile page for your new profile appears.
5.	 Click the Edit button to modify the permissions, as shown in Figure 21-3.
The Profile Edit page appears.
Salesforce packs a plethora of possible permissions into a profile page. Some 
of those permissions aren’t obvious; others are dependent on your selecting 
other permissions. If you have questions as you’re working through the Profile 
Edit page, click the Help for This Page link in the upper-right corner of the page 
to go directly to the relevant Help documentation. If you place your cursor over 
the i icon, located next to certain Administrative Permissions on the Profile Edit 
page, rollover text appears with tips on other required settings.
6.	 Under the Custom App Setting section, determine which standard and 
custom apps are visible for a profile and which one is the default.
This determines the content of the Force.com app drop-down list.
FIGURE 21-3:  
Previewing a 
Profile Edit page.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      343
7. Under the Tab Settings section, use the drop-down lists to determine the tab 
settings for your new profile.
Choose from the three possible options:
• Default On: You want a tab to be displayed.
• Default Off: You want a tab not to appear while still allowing a user assigned 
to the profile the choice to turn the tab back on. For example, if you 
created a profile for sales reps and you want to hide the Contracts tab but 
give the rep the option to display it, select Default Off on the Contracts 
field.
• Tab Hidden: You want the tab to be hidden without an option for the user 
to turn the tab back on. For example, if your company isn’t going to use 
cases, you may decide to hide the tab.
Making a tab hidden in a user’s profile doesn’t prevent the user from accessing 
those records (in reports, for example). To prevent a user from accessing a 
particular type of record altogether, remove the Read permission on that type 
of data from the Object Permissions sections of the page.
8. (Optional) Select the Overwrite Users’ Personal Tab Customizations check 
box if you want to overwrite the user’s current personal customization 
settings with the settings for the new profile that you’re applying.
9. Under the Administrative Permissions header, select or deselect check boxes 
to modify administrative permissions from the profile.
Most of these settings are designed for administrators, but some of these may 
be important, depending on your goals for a custom profile. For example, if 
you want to build a manager’s profile, you may want to retain permissions 
such as Manage Public Reports and Manage Public List Views so that managers 
can create public reports and list views for their teams.
10. Under the General User Permissions header, select or deselect check boxes 
to modify common user permissions from the profile.
For example, if you don’t want sales reps to be able to export customer data to 
a file, you could create a custom profile for reps and remove the Export 
Reports setting.
11. Under the Standard Object and Custom Object Permissions headers, select 
or deselect check boxes to modify standard or custom object permissions 
from the profile.
For example, if you don’t want support reps to be able to modify opportunities, 
you could create a custom profile for support reps and select only the Read 
check box in the row for opportunities.

344      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
12.	Click Save.
The Profile page reappears for your new profile. Your new profile will now 
appear the next time you follow the instructions in Step 1.
13.	Click the View Users button if you want to assign users to the profile.
A Custom: Custom Profile Name list page appears in which you can view, add, or 
reset passwords for users in the profile.
Defining the Role Hierarchy
Think of a role hierarchy as the Salesforce system’s data-access trickle-down org 
chart: If you’re assigned to the role at the top of the chart, you have full access to 
your own data, and that privilege trickles down to the data of everyone below you 
in the hierarchy — and life is good.
When you’re constructing your hierarchy, don’t confuse your actual company org 
chart with the role hierarchy. Role hierarchy is all about access to data to perform 
your duties in Salesforce and how you want to organize certain sales-related 
reports. As such, hierarchies often have fewer layers than a typical org chart. For 
example, if your executive team will be users, you might simply create a role 
called Executive Team, assuming that many of those users will have similar 
trickle-down viewing and editing privileges.
You can use the role hierarchy in Salesforce as a primary method to control a 
user’s visibility and access to other users’ data. After you assign a role to a user, 
that user has ownerlike access to all records owned by or shared with subordinate 
users in the hierarchy. For example, if you set up a hierarchy with a Sales Rep 
role subordinate to a Sales Manager role, users assigned to Sales Manager would 
have read and write access to records owned by or shared with users in the Sales 
Rep role.
To set up your company’s role hierarchy, click the Setup link in the upper-right 
corner and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Administer ➪ Manage Users ➪ Roles.
The Understanding Roles page appears, and you see a sample hierarchy, as 
shown in Figure 21-4.
To select a different sample hierarchy, make a selection from the View Other 
Sample Role Hierarchies drop-down list.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      345
2.	 Click the Set Up Roles button.
The Creating the Role Hierarchy page appears.
3.	 (Optional) To select a different view of the hierarchy, make a selection from 
the drop-down list on the right side of the page.
Salesforce provides three standard views for displaying the role hierarchy: tree, 
list, and sorted list. For this example, we’re opting for the default, Tree view.
4.	 In Tree view, click the Add Role button at the place in the hierarchy where 
you’d like your new role to appear.
A Role Edit page appears for the new role.
5.	 Complete the fields.
The fields are pretty obvious, but here are some tips:
•	 This Role Reports To: Use this lookup field to define the role’s place in the 
hierarchy. Because the lookup field is based on roles you already created, 
add roles by starting at the top of your hierarchy and then working your 
way down, as shown in Figure 21-5.
FIGURE 21-4:  
Seeing a sample 
role hierarchy.
FIGURE 21-5:  
Creating a new 
role in the 
hierarchy.

346      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
•	 Contact, Opportunity, and Case Access: Select these options that fit your 
company’s objectives. (You may not see these fields if you have a very 
public sharing model — more on that in the following section.) You can 
provide an account owner with read-write access to related opportunities 
or cases that she doesn’t own, has view-only access to, or has no access to. 
This flexibility comes in handy in heavily regulated industries, in which you 
might have to prevent an account executive from knowing about certain 
deals or issues going on with her account.
6.	 Click the Save button or the Save & New button.
•	 Save: The Role: Role Name page appears, displaying the detail information 
you just entered and listing any users in this role. From the users in the 
Role Name Role detail list, you may also assign existing users to this role or 
create new users with this role. (Check out the section “Creating a new 
user,” earlier in this chapter.)
•	 Save & New: A New Role page appears, and you can continue building the 
hierarchy. Repeat Steps 2–6 until your hierarchy is done.
Using Other Security Controls
Beyond the major configuration settings (such as roles, profiles, and sharing 
model), as an administrator, you have other settings for managing the use and 
security of your data in Salesforce. You can find these features by choosing 
Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Security Controls.
In the following sections, we discuss how to manage field-level access and dele-
gate a subset of administration to others.
Setting field-level security
If you have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition, you have three primary ways to con-
trol access to and editing of specific fields: profiles (which we discuss earlier in 
this chapter), page layouts (Chapter  17 covers these), and field-level settings 
(stay right here for the details). With field-level security, you can further restrict 
users’ access to fields by setting whether those fields are visible, editable, or 
read-only.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      347
To view and administer field-level security, click the Setup link and follow these 
steps:
1.	 Choose Administer ➪ Security Controls ➪ Field Accessibility.
The Field Accessibility page appears, listing all objects.
2.	 Click the link for the type of record for which you want to view and manage 
field-level security.
A Field Accessibility page for the selected record type appears, as shown in 
Figure 21-6. For example, click the Account link if you want to review the 
security settings on account fields.
3.	 Under the Choose Your View header, click the View by Fields link.
The Field Accessibility page appears with a Field drop-down list. If you want to 
see a different view of this information — in which you get to see one profile 
and the security levels for all the fields for the selected data type — click the 
View by Profiles link.
4.	 Select a field from the Field drop-down list.
The page reappears with a table displaying your company’s profiles and the 
profiles’ accessibility to the selected field.
5.	 In the Field Accessibility table, click a link in a cell in the Field Access column 
to edit the profile’s field access for a specific record type.
An Access Settings page for the selected profile and selected field appears, as 
shown in Figure 21-7. If you want to modify access for all profiles associated 
with the page layout assigned to this profile, you can also adjust that here.
6.	 Select the check boxes to modify the field-level settings, and then click Save.
The Field Accessibility page for the selected record type reappears.
FIGURE 21-6:  
Preparing to view 
field accessibility.

348      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
If you modify a field-level security setting for a profile by deselecting the Visible 
check box, this means that the record related to that field is still searchable. The 
field will never be viewable to a person with that profile, so that person won’t be 
able to create reports or search using it, but he can use reports created by others 
that leverage that field. So, if an account — say, ABC Corp. — had its Employees 
field filled out with the number 1001, but that field was not visible to Watson, who 
has the Standard User profile, Watson could still run a report created by Holmes, 
who, with a different profile, was able to customize a report looking for all 
accounts where the Employees field was greater than 1000. In that report, ABC 
Corp. would be listed and Watson would see ABC Corp., but he would not see the 
Employees field in the output. Watson would also not be able to customize a report 
using the Employees field because he can’t see it to modify a query.
If you need to provide someone with similar access to records as an existing user, 
with the exception of visibility to a few fields, we recommend that you do this via 
field-level security on a new custom profile, versus removing the field from the 
page layout. It may not be visible on a page, but that field is still visible elsewhere 
in Salesforce — like when creating and running reports and list views. Even if 
you’re not strict about a group of people not seeing a field, field-level security can 
help reduce end-users seeing an overwhelming number of fields that they have to 
wade through when creating reports.
Delegating administration
As an administrator for your growing world of Salesforce users within your com-
pany, you hold the key to who accesses your Salesforce instance. You shouldn’t try 
FIGURE 21-7:  
Modifying 
field-level access 
on a profile.

CHAPTER 21  Accessing the Right Data with User Permissions      349
to cut corners by making everyone system administrators just because you’re 
annoyed each time people bug you to add a new user, or because they get impa-
tient about your asking “Why?” in response to their requests.
Salesforce allows you to delegate some administrative duties to nonadministra-
tors. Delegated administrators can help you create and edit users in roles you 
specify, reset passwords for those users, assign users to certain profiles, and 
manage certain custom objects. For example, if your marketing department is 
growing quickly, you may want to allow a manager in the Marketing Manager role 
to add new marketing users to Salesforce who need the Marketing User profile.
With more users and different groups that need access to the same object, be cau-
tious in granting delegated administration permissions to users for specific cus-
tom objects. Usually this will result in changes being made that benefit one group 
at the expense of another, and you’re left to diplomatically mend strained rela-
tionships. It’s your responsibility as a system administrator to have a holistic 
understanding of how system changes will affect all your users.
To delegate administration, you must first define the groups of users to whom you 
want to delegate these new privileges. Then you have to specify what you want 
those newly delegated administrators to do. To define delegated administrators, 
follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Security Controls ➪ Delegated Administration.
The Manage Delegated Groups page appears.
2.	 Click New.
The Edit Delegated Group page for the new delegated group appears.
3.	 Enter the Delegated Group Name.
In our example, we selected Sales Operations.
4.	 Click Save.
The Delegated Group page for your new group appears.
5.	 Click the Add button in the Delegated Administrators related list to specify 
which users will belong in this group.
The Delegated Administrators page appears.
6.	 Use the Lookup icons to find and add users to this group.
7.	 Click Save.
The Delegated Group page for your group reappears.

350      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
8.	To specify which roles and subordinate roles a delegated administrator can 
manage, click the Add button in the User Administration related list.
The Roles and Subordinates page appears.
9.	Use the Lookup icons to find and add roles that your delegated group may 
manage.
10.	Click Save.
The Delegated Group page for your group reappears.
11.	Click Add in the Assignable Profiles related list to specify which profiles these 
delegated administrators may assign to users.
The Assignable Profiles page appears.
12.	Use the Lookup icons to find and add profiles that your delegated group may 
assign.
13.	Click Save.
The Delegated Group page for your group reappears.
14.	Click Add in the Custom Object Administration related list to specify which 
custom objects and related tabs a delegated administrator may manage.
The Custom Object Administration page appears.
15.	Use the Lookup icons to find and add custom objects that your delegated 
group may assign.
16.	Click Save.
The Delegated Group page for your group reappears.

Managing Data
I
f you’re a system administrator, often your greatest headache isn’t configuring 
or customizing the system but getting your data in and maintaining it so that 
it’s useful. Nothing hurts a rollout more than complaints from users that their 
data isn’t in Salesforce, that information is duplicated in several records, or even 
worse, that the information is wrong. Your end-user adoption suffers if you don’t 
maintain your records after the rollout. End-users love to complain about poor 
data quality, but they’re often not initially motivated to be diligent about putting 
clean data in there, or they’re in too much of a rush to determine sources of truth 
with other business groups, forgetting that garbage in equals garbage out. If 
you’re not diligent, you can find yourself in the same mess that drove you to 
Salesforce in the first place.
If data maintenance is giving you nightmares, use the data management tools in 
Salesforce to easily import leads, accounts, and contacts. If you have in-house 
expertise or engage a Salesforce partner, you can migrate other critical data (such 
as opportunities, cases, and activities) by using proven third-party tools. When 
your data is stored in Salesforce, you can rely on a variety of tools to help you 
manage and maintain your database.
In this chapter, we first discuss basic options for data import. Then we show you 
how to use Salesforce tools to manage your data (including mass-transferring, 
deleting, and reassigning data). Finally, we touch on advanced concepts, such as 
mass-transferring and mass-deleting your data. Complex data migration and 
updates of data between your data sources and Salesforce are beyond the scope of 
this book, but we make sure to point you in the right direction.
Chapter 22

352      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Understanding Your Options  
for Data Migration
Salesforce has easy-to-use wizards that step you through importing your cam-
paign updates, leads, accounts, contacts, and custom objects. If you’re a system 
administrator or you have the right profile permissions, you can perform these 
tasks for your users. For other legacy data (such as opportunities, cases, and 
activities) that you want to have in Salesforce, you have to enter information 
manually or use the Data Loader, which is a data import and export tool that 
comes with Enterprise and Unlimited editions to automatically migrate data into 
Salesforce.
Using the Data Import Wizard
The Data Import Wizard for importing leads, accounts, contacts, solutions, and 
custom objects is conveniently located under the Data Management heading in the 
Administration Setup section of Setup. It has a user-friendly interface, showing in 
Figure 22-1, that walks you through importing or updating records.
If you’re an administrator, you also see links to the import wizard in the Tools 
section of certain tab home pages. For example, if you want to import your com-
pany’s leads, click the Leads tab, and then click the Import Leads link in the Tools 
section. Steps and tips for using the import wizard for different objects’ records 
are detailed in relevant chapters of this book, as follows:
FIGURE 22-1:  
Launching the 
Data Import 
Wizard.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      353
»
» Import leads: Only a user with the Import Leads permission can perform this 
operation. See Chapter 7.
»
» Import contacts and accounts: Salesforce provides one wizard that can take 
you through importing contacts and/or accounts. Individual users also have 
the ability to import their personal contacts and accounts. See Chapters 4 
and 9.
»
» Import campaign leads or update contacts or leads linked to a campaign: 
Salesforce provides a Campaign Member Import Wizard to update marketing 
statuses for leads and contacts. See Chapter 15.
Investigating the Data Loader
Data migration is a tricky matter. The Data Loader is a small client application 
that helps bulk-import or bulk-export data in comma-separated value (.csv) for-
mat. You access this tool by choosing Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Data ­Management ➪ 
Data Loader. With this tool, you can move data into and out of any type of record 
in Salesforce, including opportunities and custom objects. The Data Loader sup-
ports inserting, updating, deleting, and exporting Salesforce records.
As someone famous once said, with great power also comes great responsibility. 
Only use Data Loader if you’re comfortable with understanding how objects and 
records relate to each other. Data Loader is a very powerful tool for nontechnical 
users. You can export data, import data, and accidentally overwrite and delete a lot 
of data.
Several vendors also provide proven extract, transform, load tools (ETLs) that 
enable you to migrate records to (or from) Salesforce, automatically scrub and 
transform the data based on custom logic that you define, and append those 
records where appropriate.
Without getting too technical, experts link data by using the Force.com applica-
tion program interface (API) to enable your technical people to access data pro-
grammatically. Force.com (http://developer.force.com) is the platform used 
to customize or integrate Salesforce to do even snazzier things than what you can 
do with it out of the box. And before you suffer from jargon overload, a platform is 
basically a collection of rules and commands that programmers can use to tell a 
program — Salesforce, in this case — to do certain things. To access the Force.
com API, though, you must have Enterprise or Unlimited Edition.

354      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Migrating Your Legacy Data
During the preparation phase of your implementation, you need a well-thought-
out and well-documented plan for your data migration strategy. That plan needs 
to include details on objectives, resources, contingencies, and timelines based on 
the different steps in your plan. In the following sections, we discuss some of the 
steps that you should consider.
Determining your data sources
The companies we’ve worked with typically have some type of existing contact 
management tool, a variety of spreadsheets with other customer data, and often, 
contact information living in users’ email inboxes and productivity applications 
(not to mention Word documents and sticky notes).
As you go through your preparation, assess what and how much information 
needs to be in Salesforce. Here are some tips for this step:
»
» Garbage in, garbage out. When you move to a new home, you usually look 
through your old home’s closets and decide what to haul with you and what 
to throw away. Moving data requires the same type of evaluation.
»
» Make a list. Catalog the different data sources, including what types of 
records, what range, and how many.
»
» Design a storage plan. Work with your customer relationship management 
(CRM) project team to determine where different information should go — 
and why.
»
» Think about the timing and the sequence of the import. For example, 
many companies create user records first, then import accounts and contacts, 
and finally, migrate and append opportunities.
»
» Keep it simple, if possible. The more complicated you make the migration, 
the greater the impact on your timeline. Assess the level of effort versus the 
potential value of the effort.
Preparing your data
Clean it now, or clean it later. Some project teams like to “scrub” data before 
importing it into Salesforce. Identifying and merging duplicates makes finding 
the right record easier. Fixing inconsistencies in your data, such as ensuring that 
all State/Province fields hold two-character abbreviations, makes reports more 
accurate.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      355
If your legacy system doesn’t make cleanup easy, you might prefer to bring all the 
records into Salesforce first and then use the Salesforce data management tools to 
clean data later. The risk is that people with the best intentions may still succumb 
to human nature and not want to focus on the cleanup effort once the data is 
already in the new system.
Regardless of when you do it, cleaning data is not glamorous work, but it’s gotta 
be done, and should be done on a regular basis. Here are a few tips as you prepare 
your data:
»
» Export to a simple format. Oftentimes, it’s easiest to export data to applica-
tions like Microsoft Access or Excel, with which you can delete columns, sort 
rows, and make global changes.
»
» Strive to use standard naming conventions. If different data sources refer 
to accounts by different names (for example, IBM versus International 
Business Machines), now is a good time to standardize naming. This can help 
avoid duplicate record creation.
»
» Edit or add fields in Salesforce to support the migration. For example, if 
your pipeline reports track margin per opportunity, you need to build a 
custom Opportunity field to support margin data. Read more about creating 
custom fields in Chapter 17.
»
» If your existing data source has unique record IDs, migrate those IDs to a 
custom read-only field. You can always delete or hide the field at a later 
stage. Not only can this help you verify the accuracy of your migration, but 
those IDs might also come in handy for integration (especially if you don’t plan 
to shut down the other data source).
»
» Map your data columns to field names in Salesforce. For example, the 
Company field in Microsoft Outlook typically maps to the Account field in 
Salesforce. Some system administrators even rename the column headers in 
migration files so that they exactly match field names in Salesforce. Doing this 
minimizes the migration madness.
»
» Conform your data to fit Salesforce standards (or the other way around). 
Each field in Salesforce has certain properties that may include size limita-
tions, decimal points, date formats, and so on.
»
» Add a Data Source column to your import file and map it to a custom 
field in Salesforce. By doing this, you can defend where data came from.
»
» Assign the correct owners to records wherever possible. If you don’t have 
all records assigned, the owner defaults to whichever administrator is 
executing the migration.
»
» Gain acceptance from stakeholders of the files you’ve prepared. At least 
if you offer them the chance to review, you avoid surprises.

356      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Testing the import
Test before you execute the final migration. Often, you discover things that you 
missed or could improve. For example, fields can be mapped incorrectly, or you 
may just need to create some extra ones. Here are a couple of tips:
»
» Select a small sample of significant records. The higher profile the records, 
the better — especially when reviewed by a stakeholder.
»
» Review page layout. Consider adjusting the page layouts to make validating 
the data import easier. Put fields in Salesforce in similar screen locations to 
those of your legacy systems.
Analyzing the test data results
When your test data is in Salesforce, compare it carefully with your test file to 
ensure accuracy and completeness. Here are a few tips on how to productively 
analyze the test data results:
»
» Build a custom report that allows you to look at the record data collectively.
»
» Open a record, if necessary, and compare it against the import file. Confirm 
that the record’s fields show what you think they should show.
»
» Build a custom view from a relevant tab home page to see your imported data 
laid out in columns on a list page. Users could go to a report, but a view keeps 
them focused.
»
» Validate the data with selected stakeholders to get their feedback and support 
that the test data results look correct. It’s not enough that you think the test 
import was accurate. Your end-users are the ultimate test.
»
» Adjust your process or make changes to the import file or Salesforce based on 
the results of the test import. For example, maybe you forgot to map a field or 
the data didn’t import correctly because of a field’s properties.
Migrating your final data
After you successfully analyze the test data results, you’re ready to import your 
file(s). Yes, that’s a simplification of what could be a complicated set of tasks, but 
the overall process is tried and true.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      357
Here are a few suggestions for this step:
»
» Communicate expectations with your users. If you’re moving from one 
system to another, you might have a lapse in which data must be updated 
prior to going live.
»
» Do it during downtime. If you have significant data, consider running the 
migration during nonworking hours. Especially if the system is live for some 
groups of users already, this may avoid confusion.
»
» Build yourself some cushion for error. Don’t try to execute the migration 
the day before sales training. Something unanticipated could happen that 
prevents successful completion.
Validating and augmenting your data
Similar to analyzing results of the test data (see the section “Analyzing the test 
data results,” earlier in this chapter), when the data has been loaded, run reports 
to validate a cross-sampling of records to ensure accuracy and completeness. If 
you can, compare screens in Salesforce with those of your legacy system. Make 
sure that data is stored in the correct fields and that values make sense. If you see 
an address in a phone field, you need to clean your data or fix your field mapping. 
Strive for perfectly imported data — but expect less than that, too.
Prior to rolling out Salesforce, take the extra step of manually or automatically 
updating some records to wow users and drive more success. When giving a dem-
onstration or training, show users these fully entered examples and let them 
know the potential for Salesforce.
Managing Your Salesforce Database
After you implement Salesforce, you need to make sure that you create processes 
for periodically updating and backing up your data. If you don’t, human error can 
lead to frustration and heartache. Duplicate records, dead leads, records that need 
to be transferred when a user leaves the company — these are just a few examples 
of data that needs to be updated.
Most of the data maintenance tools are accessible from the Data Management 
heading located under the Administrative Setup heading on the sidebar of Setup. 
(See Chapter 7 for details on deduplication options.)

358      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
Backing up your data
If you have Unlimited, Enterprise, or Professional Edition, Salesforce offers a 
weekly export service of all your data that you can use to create a backup. Other 
editions have access to a monthly export, with similar behavior.
To export and back up your data, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Data Management, and click the Data 
Export link.
The Weekly Export Service page appears.
2.	 Click the Export Now button.
3.	 Select the appropriate export file encoding from the Export File Encoding 
drop-down list and select the check boxes if you want to include files and 
replace carriage (hard) returns with spaces.
If you live in the United States or Western Europe, you don’t have to change the 
Export File Encoding selection.
4.	 Specify which Salesforce objects you want to export, or just leave the default 
Include All Data check box selected.
5.	 When you’re done, click the Start Export button.
The Weekly Export Service: Export Requested page appears. You’ll receive an 
email from Salesforce with a link to a page where you can retrieve zipped .csv 
files of all your data. You have 48 hours to download your data, after which 
time the data files are deleted.
6.	 Click the link in the email and log in to Salesforce, if required.
The Export Service page appears, as shown in Figure 22-2.
You can also access the Export Service page by choosing Setup ➪ Application 
Setup ➪ Data Management ➪ Data Export.
FIGURE 22-2:  
Downloading 
your data 
export file.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      359
7.	 Click the Download link.
A dialog box appears, allowing you to open or save your zip file to a location 
accessible from your computer.
Although not required, we recommend that you schedule a routine data export of 
your data by clicking the Schedule Export button on the Export Service page (refer 
to Figure 22-2). This option follows the same steps as an immediate backup, but 
it also allows you to select when you want your backup to automatically occur.
Mass-transferring records
A sales rep leaves. Sales territories get readjusted. You imported a file but forgot 
to assign records to the right owners in advance. These are just a few examples of 
when you might have to transfer records. Salesforce allows you to mass-transfer 
lead, account, and custom object records — and the processes for all three types 
are very similar.
When transferring leads or accounts, Salesforce automatically transfers certain 
linked records on the detail page.
»
» For both leads and accounts: All open activities owned by the current owner 
transfer to the new owner.
»
» For accounts: All notes, contacts, and open opportunities owned by the 
existing owner transfer to the new owner.
»
» For custom object records: No linked records are transferred.
To mass-transfer records, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Data Management ➪ Mass Transfer Records.
A Mass Transfer Records page appears.
2.	 Click the Transfer link for the appropriate type of record, depending on your 
needs.
A Mass Transfer page appears with a set of filtering options to help you search 
for records. You can use the filters to specify the set of data that you want to 
transfer — for example, all Accounts with San Francisco in the Billing City field.
3.	 In the Transfer From and Transfer To fields, use the Lookup icons to find the 
appropriate users.
With leads, you can also transfer to or from queues. See Chapter 7 for details 
on lead queues.

360      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
4.	 If you’re mass-transferring accounts, select the check boxes to specify 
whether you want to transfer types of opportunities, cases, and teams.
5.	 Define additional criteria to filter your search by using the drop-down lists 
and fields provided.
You do this by selecting a field from the first drop-down list, selecting an 
operator from the second drop-down list, and then typing a value in the field. 
For example, if you want to transfer all of one sales rep’s New York City 
accounts to a new rep, your criteria would be
•	 Field: City
•	 Operator: Equals
•	 Value: New York
6.	 When you’re satisfied with your settings and filters, click the Find button.
The Mass Transfer page reappears with a list of results.
7.	 Use the check boxes to select the records that you want to transfer.
8.	 When you’re done, click the Transfer button.
The Mass Transfer page reappears when the transfer is complete.
Mass-deleting records
If you’re the administrator, you may want or need to mass-delete records. A cou-
ple of typical examples include deleting dead leads and eliminating accounts that 
haven’t had any activity. Salesforce allows you to mass-delete leads, accounts, 
contacts, activities, cases, solutions, and products — and the processes are very 
similar.
To mass-delete records, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Setup ➪ Administer ➪ Data Management ➪ Mass Delete Records.
The Mass Delete Records page appears.
2.	 Click one of the Mass Delete links, depending on the type of standard record 
that you want to mass-delete.
The Mass Delete Records page appears with a three- to five-step wizard for 
mass-deleting. The five-step wizard for Accounts is shown in Figure 22-3. The 
Mass Delete Accounts page has two extra steps based on opportunities that 
are closed/won or that aren’t owned by you. The Mass Delete Products page 
has one extra step to archive products with line items on opportunities.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      361
3.	 Review the Salesforce warnings in Step 1 of the wizard.
Consider what other related records would be deleted and the consequences 
of that action. For example, deleting an account provides an option to delete its 
related opportunities. If this includes closed-won deals, this will impact any 
historical trend reporting covering that time frame.
4.	 Back up relevant data by generating a report and exporting it to Excel as part 
of Step 2 of the wizard.
See Chapter 23 for details on building and exporting reports.
5.	 Use the filters in Step 3 of the wizard to define criteria for the search.
You do this by selecting a field from the first drop-down list, selecting an 
operator from the second drop-down list, and typing a value in the field.
You can see an example of this in the preceding section.
6.	 Click the Search button.
The Mass Delete page reappears with a list of possible records at the bottom 
of the page. Do the following:
•	 If you’re mass-deleting accounts, you can select the check box in Step 4 of 
the wizard if you want to delete accounts that have Closed/Won opportuni-
ties and/or select the check box to delete accounts with another owner’s 
opportunities.
•	 If you’re mass-deleting products, select the check box if you want to archive 
products with line items on opportunities.
•	 If you’re mass-deleting another object, proceed to Step 7.
FIGURE 22-3:  
Select records for 
mass deletion.

362      PART 6  Mastering Basic Salesforce Administration
7.	 Use the Action column to select records to be deleted.
8.	 When you’re satisfied, click the Delete button.
A dialog box appears to confirm the deletion.
9.	 Click OK.
The Mass Delete page reappears, minus the records that you deleted.
Finding and merging duplicates
Salesforce can merge existing duplicate records. The hard part is less about the 
technology and more about your coming up with some foundational guidelines to 
determine whether data in a field is accurate. Some companies rely on data that 
is synced with a specific third-party service, like Dun & Bradstreet or LinkedIn. 
Whatever you choose, you need to establish a tie-breaking source of truth, 
because salespeople often find differing data from other sources that they may 
reference to justify moving that account into their territories. When you’ve 
established the guidelines, finding and merging duplicates is possible and can be 
woven into the part of a regular sales process.
For example, an inbound sales development rep may have to wade through dozens 
of inbound lead records a day from users who sign up for product trials. One of the 
data quality steps that should be ingrained in a rep’s day is clicking the Find 
Duplicates button on a lead record to see if the person already exists.
To find duplicate lead records, follow these steps:
1.	 From any lead record, click the Find Duplicates button.
The Search for Duplicates page for that lead appears.
2.	 Check which fields should determine if another record may be a duplicate.
Salesforce defaults to looking for duplicates that match by name, company, 
email address, and phone number. It returns matching leads, contacts, 
accounts, and opportunities based on the default criteria. If you change the 
criteria, click Search again to refresh the results.
3.	 Check the box to the left of each lead’s name that you want to merge.
4.	 Click Merge Leads.
The merge page for your records returns, listing all fields for that object, and 
the contents of each record for those fields. This is where your predefined 
guidelines come in. Salesforce highlights which fields have conflicting informa-
tion, and suggests which record should be the master one, as shown in 
Figure 22-4.

CHAPTER 22  Managing Data      363
5.	 Use the radio buttons on fields with conflicting data to confirm which record 
is the source of truth for a particular field.
Reference your pre-established guidelines.
6.	 Click Merge.
This action can’t be undone.
The merged record appears.
Getting Help with Complex Data Tasks
This chapter shows you some of the basic operations that you can perform to 
import and manage your data in Salesforce. For many companies that have more 
complex data needs, this may be an oversimplification. If you need help with your 
data, here are some resources you can turn to:
»
» Talk with your customer success manager or account executive. These 
folks can help define your needs and point you to the appropriate solution 
or resource.
»
» Go outside. If you’re looking for outside help, contact a Salesforce.com 
consulting partner. Your customer success manager or account executive can 
put you in touch.

H
ow much time do you waste every week trying to prepare reports for your 
manager, your team, or yourself? You have to chase down the information, 
get it into a useful format, and then make sense of the data. By the time 
you do all of that, the information is probably already out of date, despite your 
best efforts. Have you ever felt less than confident of the details or the totals?
If this sounds like a familiar problem, you can use reports in Salesforce to gener-
ate up-to-the-moment data analysis to help you measure your business. As long 
as you and your teams regularly use Salesforce to manage your accounts, oppor-
tunities, and other customer-related information, you don’t have to waste time 
wondering where to find the data and how to consolidate it. Instead, let Salesforce 
do that work for you.
And unlike other applications in which the business users often have to spend 
precious time relying on more-technical people to build their custom reports, you 
can do this all by yourself in minutes, with no geeky programming. With an easy-
to-use reporting wizard, you can customize existing reports or build them from 
scratch.
This chapter includes an overview of the standard reports provided by Salesforce, 
building reports from scratch, and modifying existing reports to make them your

own. Within a report, we take you through the different ways you can filter the 
report to get just the information that’s necessary for creating a clearer picture of 
your business. Finally, be sure to check out our suggestions on how to keep your 
reports organized in easy-to-find folders as your universe of reports expands.
Discovering Reports
With reports, you can present your data in different formats, select a seemingly 
infinite number of columns, filter your data, subtotal information, use color to 
highlight when certain conditions are met, and embed formulas, just to name a 
few features. And like other pages in Salesforce, you can quickly find the details. 
So, for example, you can go from the Reports home page to a lead report to a lead 
record simply by clicking links.
Navigating the Reports home page
When you click the Reports tab, as shown in Figure 23-1, you’ll see a search bar, a 
Folders navigation tree in the left panel of your browser, and a list of recently run 
reports within a particular folder in the main panel of this page. Salesforce has 
functionality on the Reports home page to help you more easily navigate through 
a large set of reports and dashboards. Salesforce comes standard with a set of 
predefined reports and folders that are commonly used for measuring sales, mar-
keting, support, and other functions. For example, the Opportunity Pipeline report 
is an oft-used report by sales individuals and managers to help prioritize which 
deals to work on.
FIGURE 23-1:  
The Reports 
home page.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      369
You can’t save a custom report in a standard folder. If you’re an administrator, 
consider creating custom folders using the New Report Folder option that’s 
accessed from the little folder icon to the right of the Find Folders search bar in 
the left-side pane, as shown in Figure  23-2. Organize this according to your 
important functional areas that ultimately replace these standard folders.
From the Reports home page, you can do the following:
»
» Find reports. Type keywords into the Find Reports and Dashboards search 
bar, and while you’re typing, Salesforce will return matching reports based on 
the report’s name and description fields.
»
» Search a folder. Use the Find Folders search bar or scroll down the Folders 
navigation pane to quickly locate a particular folder.
»
» Create a folder. If you’re an administrator, click the New Folder link as 
mentioned in the previous tip to create new report folders to house custom 
reports.
»
» Select a folder. When you click a folder in the Folders pane, the contents of 
that report or dashboard folder will appear in the main panel. To backtrack, 
click the All Reports option at the top of the Folders navigation tree in the 
Folders pane.
»
» Filter report lists. Use the filters on the right side of the main pane, as shown 
in Figure 23-3, to narrow the number of reports that you see within a particu-
lar reports folder.

»
» View recent reports. Select the Recently Viewed option from the filter 
drop-down list to match the criteria of what reports you want to see. Click and 
hold down your mouse button over the Scheduled Items icon (that’s its own 
column heading) to quickly select additional columns to help you more quickly 
find your report. You can also click and drag column headings to rearrange 
them or remove them.
»
» Display the report. Click a report title.
»
» Edit, delete, or export data to Excel. On standard or custom reports, click 
the Customize button, the Delete button, or the Export Details button. We talk 
more about exporting your reports in the “Exporting Reports to Excel” section, 
later in this chapter.
»
» Create a report. Click the New Report button to start the Report Builder 
Wizard.
Displaying a report
When you click a report title or run a report from the wizard, a report page appears 
based on the criteria that was set. For example, under the Opportunity Reports 
folder, click the Opportunity Pipeline link. The Opportunity Pipeline report 
appears, as shown in Figure 23-4. This report, as we mention earlier, is one of the 
most-used standard reports in Salesforce.
FIGURE 23-4:  
Displaying  
a report.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      371
A basic report page in Salesforce is broken up into a few parts:
»
» Org Drill Down: You can use this area at the top of the page to quickly limit 
results based on role hierarchy. This helps reduce the number of redundant 
reports that you have to create just to see a slightly different view of the data 
based on a team’s structure. For example, you can use the Org Drill Down to 
see how the Eastern region team’s numbers are faring. You could drill down 
even further to see how a specific sales rep in the Eastern region is doing, 
without having to create a separate report. See Chapter 21 for steps on 
setting up the role hierarchy.
»
» Report Options: This section is at the top of the page, just below the Org Drill 
Down. You can use it to summarize, filter, and perform other operations on a 
report. For details on report options, see the “Filtering Reports Efficiently” 
section, later in this chapter.
»
» Additional filters: This optional section is customized by the person building 
the report, and it allows additional filtering of certain fields that are picklists.
»
» Generated report: This section shows the report itself. What’s visible 
depends on the construction of the report and what you have permission to 
see in Salesforce. See Chapter 21 for more details on sharing.
In the Generated Report section, you can click a column heading to quickly re-sort 
your report by the selected column.
Developing Reports
Salesforce comes with a huge menu of useful reports, and yet they may not be 
exactly what you’re looking for. For example, if your company has added custom 
fields on the account record that are unique to your customer, a standard New 
Accounts report doesn’t show you all the information you want to see on recent 
accounts.
The next time you need a custom report, don’t pester the IT geeks. Instead, use 
Report Builder to build a new report or customize an existing one.
Building a report from scratch
You don’t have to be a technical guru to create a report in Salesforce. Just make 
sure that you can articulate a question that you’re trying to answer, and then 
Report Builder will guide you through the steps for creating a custom report that 
will help you answer the question.

372      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
To create a report from scratch, click the Reports tab and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New Report button.
The Create New Report page appears, as shown in Figure 23-5.
2.	 Select the report type that you want to report on, and then click Create.
You do this by first selecting the basic category of object from the Select Report 
Type panel, which displays a list of folders representing key objects. Clicking a 
folder reveals more specific report types to choose from. The standard report 
types will give you a visual preview of sample data and how it would look 
in that report template. The Create button is at the lower-right corner of 
this page.
When you click Create, the Report Builder drag-and-drop interface appears.
3.	 Customize your report using the following Report Builder features:
•	 Adjust your view and time frame. Do you want the report to show just 
records that you own, ones that you and your underlings own, or all 
records that your role is able to see? What time range do you want the 
report to cover? Use the picklists in the Show and Date Field section to 
narrow your results.
•	 Add custom filters. To help further narrow your result set, use the Add 
drop-down list along the Filters row. For example, you can create a custom 
filter to show only results where the opportunity amount is greater than 
$10,000.
FIGURE 23-5:  
Defining the 
objects for 
the report.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      373
•	 Drag and drop fields. Find fields in the left sidebar that may be additional 
columns that you want to have in your report. Simply click and drag that 
field name over to the Preview section of the Report Builder and then place 
that new column among your other headers.
•	 Add a chart. Look for an optional Add Chart button in the Preview pane to 
add a graphical summary of your results. Use the Chart Editor to choose a 
chart type, determine what data to represent, and decide how you want 
that data to be visually presented.
4.	 When you’re done creating your report, click the Save button.
The report saves, and a sample preview appears in the Report Builder Preview 
pane.
You can get pretty advanced with filtering options. As long as you can explain 
to yourself in plain English what criteria you’re looking for, you should be able 
to build a report for it using options under the Filters ➪ Add drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 23-6. For example, if you define strategic accounts as compa-
nies that either did more than $1 billion in annual revenue or had more than 
500 employees plus $500 million in annual revenue, you can generate this 
report. To do this, add your field filters from the Filters ➪ Add picklist and then 
choose the Filter Logic option. A field will appear where you can order each 
filter you have and associate it using AND or OR logic.
Customizing existing reports
A fast and easy way to generate reports is to customize an existing report and save 
it as a new one. For example, if you like the standard Pipeline Report but you want 
to modify the columns, you can simply work from the existing report.
FIGURE 23-6:  
Adding filter logic 
to the report.

374      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
To customize an existing report, go to the Reports tab and follow these steps:
1.	 Find a folder that contains a report that you want to customize; click that 
folder, and then click a link for that report in the main Reports pane.
The report appears.
2.	 Click the Customize button.
Using the Customize button, the Report Builder page appears. You can then 
drag and drop interface fields into columns for that report (as discussed in the 
previous section). A preview of the report appears while you’re customizing it.
3.	 Continue customizing your report until you’re satisfied, and then click the 
Run Report button.
The report appears modified based on your settings from the wizard.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save or Save As.
The Save button replaces the prior custom report. The Save As button saves 
the new report as a new one. In either case, a page appears to save the report.
5.	 Complete the fields and click Save.
The Reports home page appears, with a link to your new report.
CREATING CUSTOM REPORT TYPES
The Report Wizard is pretty darn thorough. At the same time, your company’s quant 
jocks may want to perform even more advanced reporting than what’s offered in the 
standard Report Wizard. Or you may want to simplify the number of fields that your 
report users see when they go through the wizard. Professional Edition, Enterprise 
Edition, and Performance Edition administrators can create custom report types (CRTs) 
to address both of these needs.
For more advanced reporting capabilities, in techno-speak, CRTs let you change the 
joins on the table. So, if you have a Projects object and want to report on all accounts 
with projects and project team members, you can create a CRT and determine which 
fields show up in your Select Columns to Total step. For more information on setting up 
CRTs, go to the Help & Training section within Salesforce and search for create a custom 
report type.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      375
Filtering Reports Efficiently
Over time, you’ll develop core reports that have the columns that you want in a 
format that makes sense to you. One of the huge benefits of reporting in ­Salesforce 
is that you can use existing reports on the fly and apply report options to filter or 
reorder the report results.
All those options and more are possible in seconds without having to use the Cus-
tomize button. In the following sections, we show you how to filter your reports 
with tools and enhanced drill-down and breakout options.
Using the Report Options section
When you open a report, it appears with a variety of filters in the Report Options 
section at the top of the page, as shown in Figure 23-7. By using the filters in the 
Report Options section, you can look at your data from multiple angles. The avail-
able standard filters depend on the type of report that you selected.
To try out the standard filters in the Report Options section by using the Oppor-
tunity Pipeline report as an example, first go to the Reports home page and click 
the Opportunity Pipeline link. The report appears. From the report, you can do the 
following with the filters in the Report Options section:
»
» Summarize your report by a field. From the Summarize Information By 
drop-down list, select a field that determines how your information is 
summarized. For example, if you want to look at your opportunities by rep, 
select Opportunity Owner.
»
» Choose a time frame. From the Time Frame area, first select a date field, and 
then in the drop-down list to the right, select a standard range or create one 
of your own. For example, if you want to look at all opportunities created from 
2015 to the present, you’d first select Created Date, and then define the 
interval.
»
» Choose a scope. From the Show drop-down list, select the scope of records.
FIGURE 23-7:  
Identifying your 
report options.

376      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
»
» Look at open or closed records. Use the Opportunity Status drop-down list if 
you want open and/or closed records.
»
» Limit results. Use the Probability drop-down list if you want to limit the 
results by probability.
At any particular time, click the Run Report button to apply your selected filters. 
The report reappears based on the filters you defined.
If you ultimately want to save the report, click the Save or Save As button, and 
then save the report as usual. (See the section “Building a report from scratch,” 
earlier in this chapter, for details on saving.)
Hiding and showing details
To see a collapsed or expanded view of your report data, click the Hide/Show 
Details button in the Report Options section. For example, from the Reports home 
page, click the Sales by Account report under Sales Reports. When the report 
appears, click the Hide Details button. The report reappears in a collapsed view, 
and the Hide Details button morphs into the Show Details button. Now click the 
Show Details button, and the report expands again. By using Hide Details, you can 
easily view headings, subtotals, and totals, especially for matrix reports.
Filtering with the drill-down menu
Reports in Salesforce have a drill-down function that you can use to select rows 
within a report and instantly break them down by a different field. For example, if 
you’re reviewing an Opportunity by Rep report, you may want to select a specific 
rep and then sort the rep’s opportunities by stage. With enhanced drill-down and 
breakout options, you can do this in just a few quick clicks.
To use the drill-down and breakout options (using Sales by Rep as the example), 
follow these steps:
1.	 From the Reports home page, click the Sales by Rep link under the Sales 
Reports folder.
The report appears.
2.	 In the left column of the report, select check boxes for records you want to 
view.
If you don’t see check boxes and you know you’ve closed opportunities in 
Salesforce, select an interval in the Report Options section to see all your 
historical opportunities and click Run Report to view more records.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      377
3.	 At the bottom of the page, select a field from the Check Rows to Filter, Then 
Drill Down By drop-down list to summarize the information, if desired, and 
then click the Drill Down button.
The report reappears based on your selections. For example, if you chose the 
Close Month option from the Drill Down By drop-down list, your selected 
opportunities would be sorted by close month.
4.	 If you want to use the report in the future, click Save As, and then follow the 
normal directions for saving reports.
See the section “Building a report from scratch,” earlier in this chapter, for 
saving details.
Clearing filters
If you have reports with advanced filters, you can easily view and clear the filters 
to expand the results. For example, if you created and saved the test report in the 
preceding section, you may want to clear the filter on the selected rep(s) to see all 
closed opportunities by close month for all reps. The advanced filters, if any, 
appear just below the Filtered By header on a report page.
To clear a filter, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the link for a report to which you applied filters.
The report appears, and your criteria filters are listed under the Filtered By 
header, as shown in Figure 23-8.
FIGURE 23-8:  
Clearing criteria 
filters in a 
drill-down report.

378      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
2.	 Right below the Filtered By header, click the Clear link to remove a filter.
The report reappears, displaying a potentially wider universe of data.
3.	 Be sure to click the Save or Save As button if you want to save this report.
You can quickly modify advanced filters by clicking the Edit link next to the 
­Filtered By header. The Report Builder page appears.
Exporting Reports to Excel
Ideally, you want to run your reports right out of the application, getting rid of 
that mad scramble of collecting data before your next big meeting. However, 
sometimes you’ll want to generate a report and then export it to Excel. Maybe you 
need to run some complex spreadsheet calculations, or you need to plug numbers 
into an existing macro template. No problem. You can do that with the click of a 
button.
To export a report, click the Reports tab and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Name of the report you want to export.
The report appears.
For some reports, you can skip this step by selecting the Export option in the 
Action drop-down menu next to the report name.
2.	 Click the Export Details button.
A page appears to define your settings for exporting the file.
3.	 Complete the fields and click the Export button.
A window appears, prompting you to open or save the file.
4.	 Follow the steps, as desired.
When the file opens, the report data appears in Excel.
5.	 Click Done to return to your Salesforce report.
The report page reappears.
Some companies get nervous about certain users having the ability to export com-
pany data. If this is a concern, and you have the Enterprise or Performance Edi-
tion, you can take one precaution by using custom profiles to eliminate the ability 
of some users to export to Excel. See Chapter  21 for more details on creating 
­custom profiles.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      379
Organizing Reports
A word to the wise: Reports start multiplying like rabbits as you become addicted 
to reporting in Salesforce. Do yourself a favor: Organize them from day one and 
lay out a process for maintaining and deleting reports.
Creating new folders
Nothing is worse than seeing a gazillion reports under the Unfiled Public Reports 
folder. You start wasting a ridiculous amount of time just identifying which report 
is the one you want. If you have permission to manage public folders, avoid the 
headache by creating new report folders.
To create a new report folder, click the Reports tab and follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New Folder link to the right of the Find Folders search bar.
A New Report Folder page appears.
2.	 Type a name for the folder in the Report Folder Label field.
For example, if you want a folder for operational reports, you might name it 
Sales Ops Reports.
3.	 Use the Public Folder Access drop-down list to determine read versus read/
write privileges to the folder.
If you select Read/Write, a user with access to the folder can save over the 
original report.
4.	 Use the two list boxes and the Add/Remove buttons to select reports in the 
Unfiled Public Reports folder and move them to the new folder.
5.	 Use the radio buttons to select who should have access to the folder.
As with other Salesforce folder tools, your choices are All, None, and Selective.
6.	 If you chose the Selective option in Step 5, use the two list boxes and Add/
Remove buttons to highlight groups or roles and move them to the Shared To 
list box.
7.	 When you’re done, click Save.
The Reports home page reappears, and your folder is added to the Folder 
menu.

380      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
Determining folder access
One of the great features of Salesforce reporting is the ability to determine who 
gets to access which reports easily and intuitively. Access to reports (and dash-
boards) is controlled via the settings on the folder in which they’re stored.
When you’ve created some report folders, you can use them to determine who gets 
access to which folders. For example, if you don’t want anyone to see a report 
you’ve created (or you’re not ready to share it yet), just keep it in a personal folder 
that only you have access to. By default, any folder you create is only accessible to 
you and administrators until you decide to share it with others.
Salesforce has three different types of access levels to report folders:
»
» Viewer: The viewer of a folder can view a report, refresh it, and run it. A user 
with this access level can’t customize or save the report, unless he clones it 
into a new report.
»
» Editor: An editor of a folder can view, refresh, and run a report, as well as edit, 
move, save, or delete it.
»
» Manager: The manager of a folder can do everything a viewer and editor can 
do, plus she can share the report with others and rename it.
To add users with these privileges to a report, just hover over the folder in ques-
tion, click the pin on the right side, and click Share.
Maintaining your report library
Actually, what’s worse than a gazillion reports under Unfiled Public Reports is a 
universe of reports, some of which are valuable, others of which are useless. Cre-
ating public report folders is a good first step, but you may want to apply some of 
these additional hints on a periodic basis:
»
» Accurately name your reports. You and your users can’t know what’s 
behind a report link unless you name it clearly and precisely.
»
» Consider using report numbers within your report names. For instance, 
use standard file-naming conventions like 1.1 North America Pipeline. This 
way, managers can refer to report numbers so that everyone’s looking at the 
same report.
»
» Delete unnecessary reports. If multiple people in your company have 
permission to manage public reports, you may want to survey them before 

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      381
accidentally deleting a report. Unnecessary or redundant reports just make it 
harder for everyone to find what he or she wants. And in case you mistakenly 
delete a report (you’ll find out soon enough), you have up to 15 days to rescue 
it from the Recycle Bin.
»
» Update existing reports as needs arise. For example, if you created an 
Opportunity Product Report and used an advanced filter such as Product 
Family Equals Software, make sure that you manually update the report if the 
product family name changes. Otherwise, your reports will be off.
»
» Use clear report questions. For example, you might use the Report Question 
field to summarize certain filters to your report.
Mastering Reports
As Salesforce has matured over the years and more users have come to rely on it 
to house the bulk of their customer-touching information, users’ reporting needs 
have also matured. Salesforce has done a great job of making potentially very 
complicated database queries still accessible to the business user.
In this section, we talk briefly about some of the more advanced functionality, in 
case you’re feeling stuck about how to get information in your reports in a certain 
way. Most likely, you have a way to get you what you want, but you may need to 
dig a little deeper into Salesforce.
Building custom summary formulas
Salesforce provides prebuilt functionality that calculates the sum, average, high-
est value, and lowest value of certain fields that you select for your reports. How-
ever, you may need additional summary information based on calculations unique 
to your business. For example, your business may want to see win-rate percent-
ages or coverage ratios in your reports. Salesforce allows the addition of custom 
formula calculations for your reports (and dashboards). This means that you can 
take summary information from other fields and lump them together to come up 
with a new calculation and corresponding result. It doesn’t matter whether you 
know old math or new math, Salesforce can derive these values for you using 
Excel-like commands.

382      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
To create a new custom summary formula, follow these steps:
1.	 Click a link for an existing report.
The report appears.
2.	 Click the Customize button.
The Report Builder appears.
3.	 In the Fields column in the left pane of the Report Builder, find the Formulas 
folder and click into that to drill down.
4.	 Select the Add Formula option, as shown in Figure 23-9, and drag it into the 
preview pane as its own column.
The Custom Summary Formula Wizard page pops up.
5.	 Complete the fields, as required:
•	 Enter a column name as it will appear on the report in the Label field. 
Optionally, type a description. Ideally, this field helps explain the math 
formula in layman’s terms.
•	 Select the type of format that you want your results to be in from the Format 
drop-down list. For example, if you want to calculate the revenue per item 
of all your products in the pipeline this year, you’ll want your result to be 
Currency.
•	 Select the number of decimal places to display for your selected data type 
from the Decimal Places drop-down list.
•	 Choose where you want the summary calculations to be displayed in the report. 
Reference the visual guide to assist you in determining if you want the 
output to appear at all summary levels or just specific ones.
6.	 Build your formula in the Formula section, as shown in Figure 23-10:
a.	 Select one of the fields listed in the Summary Fields drop-down list, and then 
choose the kind of summary type to use in your formula.
This field’s value, and how it will be summarized, are automatically added 
into your formula. In our example, we select Amount and Average.
FIGURE 23-9:  
Adding a custom 
formula.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      383
b.	 Click the appropriate operator icons from the drop-down list with the 
same name.
In our example, we select the / (Divide) option.
c.	 Repeat these steps, as needed, to build your formula.
If you need to know what functions to use for a particular operation, use the 
Functions picklist. Salesforce will also return some help text to give you an 
idea of how those functions should be formatted.
7.	 Click Check Syntax to check your formula.
Syntax that contains errors is automatically highlighted.
8.	 Click OK when you’re finished.
The pop-up window closes, and you’re back at the Report Wizard. You should 
see the new column showing sample data in the Preview section.
The custom summary formula isn’t saved until you save the report. Clicking 
Done just includes it in this step of the Report Wizard. Make sure that you save 
the report.
9.	 Click Run Report to see the new column showing real data.
FIGURE 23-10:

custom formula 
for your report.

384      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
Understanding additional  
reporting options
You can do a lot more fun things with reports. Even many long-term users of 
Salesforce reports may not know about all these additional analytics capabilities. 
Here is a brief summary to get data detectives more excited about it:
»
» Conditional highlighting: You can apply conditional highlighting to summa-
rize matrix reports and help you easily highlight values that may deserve more 
of your attention. You can use this with custom summary formulas to highlight 
high or low percentages, averages, and ratios. You see a lot of syllables in 
this feature, but conditional highlighting translates into setting thresholds for 
certain key numerical values and color-coding them to show whether a 
threshold has been surpassed. In an Opportunity Pipeline by Rep report, you 
can quickly get an understanding of how people are doing when each rep’s 
total won opportunities are highlighted in red, green, or yellow.
»
» Bucketing fields: Bucketing a field lets you select a column in a report, define 
ranges for data in that field, and group them into “buckets” with names that 
you get to define. For example, the currency captured in an Amount field 
could be updated into three categories: small, medium, and large. You can 
define what currency ranges fall under the small bucket, what range falls 
under the medium bucket, and so on. You can identify columns in reports that 
are bucket fields by the little bucket icon to the left of the column name. To 
see an example of how a bucket field is created, refer to Figure 23-11.
FIGURE 23-11:  
Building bucket 
field ranges.

CHAPTER 23  Analyzing Data with Reports      385
»
» Joined reports: This is a powerful tool that allows you to create one report 
that consists of report “blocks,” each of which is a separate report that may or 
may not be reporting off the same objects. So, if you were trying to run a 
report that showed both your closed won opportunities as well as the 
opportunity win rate, you could join two reports. One block would show the 
total of all your closed won opportunities for a time range, while a second 
block could be based off of all opportunities so that you can calculate that 
win ratio.
»
» Scheduled report runs: If you have the fun job of providing the powers that 
be with the same type of report every Monday morning, or at the end of every 
month, you can automate the running and emailing of a report after you’ve 
customized it and made it just right for everyone.
For more in-depth information on each of these advanced analytics capabilities, 
click the Help & Training link in Salesforce and search using the appropriate 
­keywords (conditional highlighting, bucketed fields, and joined reports) in the 
search bar.

ashboards are visual representations of custom reports that you create in 
Salesforce. For example, you can see data in a chart, a graph, or a gauge. 
You can use dashboards to illustrate key performance indicators (KPIs) and 
other metrics important to your business. A metric is simply something you want 
to measure (for example, sales by rep, leads by source, opportunities by partner, 
cases by agent, and so on).
What does this mean for you? If you’re a sales or service rep, you can track your 
daily progress against attainment of goals. If you’re a manager, you can easily see 
how reps stack up against each other and where you need to get involved to hit 
your numbers. And if you’re on the executive team, you have dashboards with 
actionable charts and graphs for strategic decision making to improve the 
business.
In this chapter, we share tips on planning your metric reporting strategy. Then we 
show you how to create dashboards. We walk you through updating dashboard 
properties and components. We also explain how to organize dashboards and their 
related reports so that you know you’re looking at the right information.
Chapter 24

388      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
Figuring Out Dashboards
Dashboards are pages in Salesforce comprising tables and charts designed to help 
you understand important aspects of your business, such as opportunities per ter-
ritory and leads by source. Dashboards are critical to being able to assess the 
health of your business and spot trends early. The following sections show you 
some basic concepts so that you can consider your strategies before you start 
unleashing them on your organization.
Breaking down basic elements
You can build a dashboard with as many as 20 individual charts, tables, metrics, 
gauges, or custom components; each item is a dashboard component. Similar to 
building charts with the Report Wizard (see Chapter 23), components are based on 
reports that you create. In fact, you can click a component on a dashboard to make 
the underlying report appear. Here’s a quick summary of the components that are 
available to you:
»
» Horizontal bar or vertical column charts (see Figure 24-1) are great when 
you want to depict a simple measurement with an x-axis and a y-axis. For 
example, use bar charts if you want to create a component that displays 
pipeline by stage.
»
» Horizontal bar or vertical column grouped charts work well when you 
want to compare groups of bars with each other. For example, use grouped 
bar charts if you want to create a chart that displays pipeline by stage broken 
out for each month.
FIGURE 24-1:  
A vertical  
column chart.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      389
»
» Horizontal bar or vertical column stacked charts work well when you want 
grouping within a bar. For example, use stacked column charts if you want to 
create a chart that shows cases by status and then by type (such as problems 
versus feature requests).
»
» Horizontal bar or vertical column stacked-to-100% charts are excellent 
when you’re more interested in percentages than amounts. If you’re compar-
ing new versus existing business, stacked-to-100% charts can help you 
understand what percentage of each stage was new business versus existing 
business.
»
» Pie charts (see Figure 24-2) work just like the standard bar charts, but the 
data is shown as a pie with the percentage and amount for each wedge.
»
» Donut charts work just like pie charts but also show the total for the whole 
chart. (Goes great with coffee and morning meetings.)
»
» Funnel charts add an additional visual element to the mix by changing the 
height of each grouping based on its proportion. For example, use a funnel 
chart if you want to easily see how much each stage in your pipeline is worth.
»
» Line charts are helpful if you’re trying to express trends, particularly when 
time is part of the measurement. For example, use a line chart if you want to 
analyze the number of newly created opportunities by month for your entire 
company.
»
» Grouped line charts add a layer of complexity. For example, a line group 
chart could help you express the number of newly created opportunities by 
month broken out by region or unit.
FIGURE 24-2:  
A pie chart.

390      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
»
» Cumulative line charts allow you to track the progress of a single metric over 
time. For example, a line cumulative chart could help you see the number of 
closed cases by day over the course of an entire month.
»
» Grouped cumulative line charts allow you to track progress over multiple 
metrics over time. For example, a line grouped cumulative chart could help 
you see the number of closed cases grouped by agent per day over the course 
of an entire month.
»
» Tables create simple but powerful four-column tables. For example, use 
tables if you want your dashboard to show the top ten forecasted deals in the 
quarter in descending value.
You can create tables in dashboards but not in the charting tool of the Report 
Wizard.
»
» Metrics insert the grand total of a report at the end of a dashboard label that 
you customize. Metrics are compelling when you want to tell a story that 
might require a bit more explanation. Metrics tend to work well in concert 
with other components. For example, if you use a pie chart to summarize 
opportunity by stage, you could add a metric to summarize total pipeline.
»
» Gauges (see Figure 24-3) are useful when you have a specific measurable 
objective and you want to track your progress. A gauge applies the grand total 
of a report as a point on a scale that you define. For example, use a gauge if you 
want to measure actual quarterly new bookings against a quota that you define.
»
» Scatter charts aid in showing correlation between one to two groupings of 
data. For example, you can look at all closed-won opportunities last quarter, 
and group those by account owner. On your x-axis, you can measure the total 
amount of those closed-won deals (still grouped by the opportunity owner), 
and your y-axis can show the annual revenue for each account (which is a 
FIGURE 24-3:  
A gauge.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      391
standard field on that account record). Do your salespeople tend to close a 
higher value of deals when the customer itself generates more revenue? Let 
your scatter chart tell you.
»
» Visualforce Pages allow you to create your own custom dashboard compo-
nents (or download other people’s). Even if you’re just interested in a snazzier 
graphic element, go to www.appexchange.com and click the Components 
category to see what others have created.
If you’re an administrator or a user with permission to manage dashboards, you 
can create, edit, and organize them. And even if you don’t have such permissions, 
you can still view them by clicking the Dashboards tab on the home page.
Planning useful dashboards
We always say that the best way to build a system is to envision what you want to 
ultimately measure. Do you want to know who your top sales reps are? Would you 
like to understand what your best accounts are buying from you and how much? 
Do you wonder how long it takes to close a case? This method of starting with the 
business questions you want to answer applies to your building of reports and is 
true of dashboards.
If you’re an administrator or part of the team responsible for deploying Sales-
force, consider these tips as you develop your dashboards:
»
» Focus on your end-users. Meet with sales, marketing, and support manage-
ment and have them define their KPIs for their teams and business. Knowing 
this helps you customize Salesforce and construct useful dashboards.
»
» Create a common set of components to reflect a universal way to look at 
business health. This is especially true if your company has multiple sales 
teams. For example, after you determine the key sales metrics for your 
company’s overall dashboard, you can replicate the dashboard and then 
customize other dashboards for each sales team. By doing this, everyone in 
the company is speaking a common language.
Building Dashboards
To build a dashboard, you need to create your custom reports first. You also need 
to create public folders for your dashboard reports if you want dashboards to be 
viewable for other users. See Chapter  23 for all the details on creating custom 
reports and organizing them in folders.

392      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
Only system administrators and users with permission to manage dashboards can 
add, edit, and delete dashboards. See Chapter  21 for details on how to grant 
permissions.
In the following sections, we show you how to install a prebuilt dashboard and 
how to clone a dashboard. Then we cover the steps to build a dashboard from 
scratch.
Installing sample dashboards  
and reports
One of the best ways to get your feet wet with dashboards is to install sample 
dashboards from the AppExchange. Salesforce not only creates the dashboard for 
you but also builds the underlying sample reports to generate the components.
To install sample dashboards, follow these steps:
1.	 In your web browser go to www.appexchange.com.
The AppExchange home page appears.
2.	 Type Dashboards in the Search bar at the top and click the Magnifying Glass 
button.
A page full of AppExchange apps appears. The apps with the Salesforce or 
Salesforce Labs logos are made and provided for free by Salesforce.com.
3.	 Click an app’s listing to see more information about it.
The App Overview page appears with a description and images. If you find a 
set of dashboards that you’d like to download and install, check out Chapter 19 
for more information on installing apps from the AppExchange.
If you’re having trouble accessing dashboards, or installing them from the 
AppExchange, you may not have the proper permissions. In this circumstance, 
consult with your administrator.
Cloning a dashboard
To save time or repurpose useful features, you can generate a dashboard by clon-
ing an existing one and then modifying it. For example, if you envision creating 
multiple dashboards for different sales units with common components, you can 
use this shortcut and then modify the associated reports.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      393
When you clone a dashboard, you don’t clone another set of identical reports. 
Instead, the newly cloned dashboard references the same custom reports that the 
original dashboard references. If you want the new dashboard to refer to different 
reports, see the “Developing a dashboard from scratch” section, later in this 
chapter.
To clone a dashboard, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Dashboards tab.
The last dashboard that you viewed appears.
2.	 Type the name of a dashboard in the Find a Dashboard search bar to search 
for a dashboard, or browse and select an option from the Find a Dashboard 
drop-down list to select a dashboard that you want to clone.
In this example, choose the sample dashboard entitled Company Performance 
Dashboard.
The dashboard appears.
3.	 Click the Clone button.
The Dashboard Builder page appears.
4.	 Update any of the dashboard components as you see fit.
5.	 Click Save to leave the Dashboard Builder.
The Save Dashboard dialog box appears.
6.	 Change your new dashboard’s settings, paying close attention to the 
following:
•	 Title: Change the title of the dashboard.
•	 Dashboard Unique Name: This field is automatically populated for you with 
your title, but any spaces are replaced by underscores. The Dashboard 
Unique Name is used by Salesforce to distinguish dashboards from a 
database perspective.
•	 Save To: Select the folder in which to store this dashboard from this 
drop-down list.
•	 Running User: The running user is the user whose security settings will apply 
to the dashboard. So, any user who can view the dashboard will see what 
that running user sees.
If the running user for a dashboard ever leaves the company or is made 
inactive for another reason, the dashboard won’t show data. The same goes 
for any reports the dashboard references if that report is moved into a folder 
that the running user doesn’t have access to.
7.	 Click Save to view your new dashboard.

394      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
Developing a dashboard from scratch
Now that you know the basics of dashboards, let’s find out how to develop a dash-
board from scratch.
To create a new dashboard, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Reports tab.
The Reports & Dashboards home page appears.
You need to build your custom reports before you can develop a dashing new 
dashboard.
2.	 Build your custom reports and save them to a public folder.
See Chapter 23 to find out how to build custom reports.
Dashboards that you want others to see can’t use reports in your My Personal 
Reports folder. For purposes of this running example, find and click the Sales 
Reports folder (located in the left sidebar of the Reports & Dashboards folder 
navigation tree on the Reports & Dashboards home page) and click the 
following reports that show up in the main page:
•	 Sales by Rep: Modify the Report Options to summarize information by 
Opportunity Owner and then Stage. Then save the report as Pipe by Rep 
and Stage to a public folder.
•	 Sales by Account: Modify the Report Options to summarize information by 
Account Name. Then save the report as Top Revenue Customers to a 
public folder.
You must be an administrator or a user with permission to manage public 
reports if you want to add report folders.
3.	 Click back on the Reports tab.
The Reports & Dashboards home page appears.
4.	 Click the New Dashboard button.
The Dashboard Builder page appears.
5.	 Drag the horizontal bar chart component from the Components tab on the 
left to one of the three available dashboard columns on the right.
A New Dashboard Component appears in Edit mode.
6.	 Complete the fields, entering a header, footer, and/or title.
For this running example, name the header PIPELINE METRICS and enter the 
title Pipe by Rep and Stage. You could also add a footer at the stage, but don’t 
bother for this example.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      395
7.	Click the Data Sources tab on the left.
A list of reports grouped by folder appears.
8.	Find the appropriate report by expanding the folder you saved it in.
You can use the plus and minus signs to expand and collapse the report 
folders.
9.	Drag the report onto your dashboard component.
A preview of your dashboard component appears.
10.	Click Save.
The Save Dashboard dialog box appears.
11.	Enter a title and select a folder to save to.
12.	Click the Save and Run Dashboard button to run the dashboard.
Your new dashboard appears with your dashboard component.
Modifying dashboard properties
Over time, you may have to make changes to your dashboards, whether for 
­cosmetic reasons or to make substantive updates. We can come up with a dozen 
common edits, but the good news is that updating is easy.
If you need to change the basic settings of a dashboard — such as the title, folder, 
or running user — you need to edit the dashboard properties. To edit the proper-
ties, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Dashboards tab.
A dashboard appears.
2.	 Select a desired dashboard from the Find a Dashboard search bar that also 
doubles as a drop-down list.
The dashboard you’re trying to locate appears.
You can also just start typing a portion of the name of one of your dashboards 
to be presented with a list of matching dashboards.
3.	 Click the Edit button at the top of the dashboard page.
The Dashboard Builder appears.
4.	 Click the Dashboard Properties button.
The Dashboard Properties dialog box appears.

396      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
5.	 Modify the settings, as needed, and then click OK.
When you click OK, the Dashboard Builder reappears, and your setting 
changes are applied.
Customizing components
You may want to add or change — edit — an existing component. To edit a 
­component, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to a dashboard and click the Edit button.
The Dashboard Builder appears.
2.	 Click the Wrench icon above a component that you want to modify.
For example, you may want to change the chart type or display units.
The Component Editor dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 24-4.
3.	 Modify the component data to adjust settings:
•	 For bar, column, or line charts: From the Group By drop-down list, click a 
chart type to select the way multiple groups of values are displayed.
•	 For unit of measurement: Use the Display Units drop-down list.
•	 Component type: Click a chart image to select a component type. See the 
earlier section “Breaking down basic elements” for details on the compo-
nents. In the example, select the vertical bar chart option. The steps will 
differ, depending on which component type you select.
FIGURE 24-4:  
Modifying 
component data.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      397
4.	 Click the Formatting tab to change the type and formatting of your 
dashboard component to best display your data:
•	 Table and chart components: Use the Sort Rows By drop-down list to select 
the order of sorting. For example, if you want to rank the reps from biggest 
to smallest pipeline, choose Row Value Descending. You can also sort the 
row labels if you want to rank the reps by their names.
•	 Maximum values displayed: (Optional) If you want, enter a number under 
Maximum Values Displayed.
•	 Bar, column, scatter, or line charts: Select an option from the Axis Range 
drop-down list. If you select Manual, the next two fields (Chart Axis Range 
Minimum and Chart Axis Range Maximum) become available for input.
•	 Legend position: Select an option from the Legend Position drop-down list 
to display your graph’s legend to the right of the chart or below the chart, 
or to not show it at all.
•	 Chart labeling: Adjust the chart labeling by selecting the Show Values and 
the Show Details on Hover check boxes.
•	 Tables, metrics, and gauges: Set up to two breakpoint values to separate 
different range colors from each other. Select Range Colors to represent a 
range of data, separated by the breakpoint values. (See Chapter 23 for 
more information on conditional highlighting.)
•	 Gauges: Set your Minimum and Maximum Values to represent the lowest 
and highest values on the gauge.
5.	 Click OK.
The Dashboard Builder reappears with the changes you applied to the 
component.
6.	 Click Save.
Your changes are saved, and your dashboard reappears.
Changing the layout
If you need to modify the dashboard layout, you can also perform this while in the 
Dashboard Builder.
Go to a dashboard, click the Edit button, and alter the layout. You can
»
» Modify a column size. Select Narrow, Medium, or Wide from the drop-down 
list at the top of each dashboard component. All the components in the 
column change in size based on your setting.

398      PART 7  Measuring Overall Business Performance
»
» Add a component. Drag a component or data source to a column and follow 
the steps in the section “Developing a dashboard from scratch,” earlier in this 
chapter.
»
» Delete a component. Click the X button located at the upper-right corner of a 
component. A pop-up window appears to confirm the deletion. When you 
click OK, the pop-up closes and the dashboard reappears, minus the deleted 
component.
»
» Add a column. If you have fewer than three columns in your dashboard, you 
can click the plus button at the upper right or left of a column to insert a new 
column on that side, respectively.
»
» Delete a column. Click the X button located at the top of a column. A pop-up 
window appears to confirm the deletion. When you click OK, the pop-up 
closes and the dashboard reappears, minus the deleted column.
»
» Rearrange components. Drag and drop components in your dashboard to 
arrange them exactly as you see fit.
When you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button. The dashboard 
reappears with your modifications.
You can add up to 20 components per Dashboard, but best practice is to keep your 
dashboards simple and easy to read. Your most important components should 
comprise the top row. The top row’s components for a dashboard are displayed on 
the home pages of users who have chosen that dashboard as the one to view.
Setting a dashboard refresh schedule
Before you make decisions based on your dashboard, you’ll want to make sure that 
those decisions are based on the latest data. Click any dashboard from your 
­dashboard list. In the upper-right corner of the dashboard is a timestamp starting 
with As Of. You can use this to find out the last time your dashboard data was 
updated.
When you want to manually update your dashboard data, simply click the Refresh 
button at the top of the dashboard page. The components reappear one by one. 
When the refresh is completed, a new timestamp appears.
Enterprise and Unlimited Edition customers can schedule their dashboards to be 
automatically refreshed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Just use the drop-
down list next to the Refresh button.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      399
To schedule a dashboard to automatically refresh, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Dashboards tab.
A dashboard appears.
2.	 Click the down arrow on the Refresh button.
3.	 Click the Schedule Refresh option.
The Schedule Dashboard Refresh screen appears, as shown in Figure 24-5.
4.	 (Optional) Select the To Me and/or the To Others check boxes to email a copy 
of the dashboard when it’s refreshed.
If you have regularly scheduled meetings, you can automatically email your 
dashboard to the meeting attendees prior to the meeting to give them a sneak 
peak of what will be discussed.
5.	 Select the frequency that you want your dashboard to be refreshed.
Each frequency option has additional options that allow you to specify exactly 
when the dashboard will be refreshed.
6.	 Select a start and end date for the frequency that you want your dashboard 
to be refreshed.
7.	 Select a refresh time from the Preferred Start Time drop-down list.
The dashboard reappears.

Organizing Your Dashboards
If you have the permissions necessary to manage dashboards, manage public 
reports, and view all data, you can organize your company’s dashboards in folders 
and define the proper security access for users. By organizing dashboards, you can 
make sure that the right people are focusing on the right metrics to manage their 
business.
Viewing dashboard lists
Unlike most other tabs in Salesforce, clicking the Dashboard tab doesn’t take you 
to its home page. Instead, the last dashboard that you viewed appears.
To access your viewable dashboards, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Go to Dashboard List link at the upper-left corner of any 
dashboard.
A dashboard folder list page appears.
2.	 Use the Folder drop-down list to select a desired folder.
The Reports & Dashboards home page appears. The page for the selected 
folder appears in the main window with a list of available dashboards in the 
folder.
From this list page, users with the permissions mentioned in the preceding 
section can perform a variety of functions:
•	 Re-sort: Click a column header to re-sort a dashboard list.
•	 View: Click a title name to view a dashboard.
•	 Modify: Click the downward-pointing triangle in the Action column of the 
row that matches the dashboard you want to edit. A drop-down list 
appears. The Edit link appears in the drop-down list for your selection.
•	 Delete: Click the downward-pointing triangle in the Action column of the 
row that matches the dashboard you want to delete. A drop-down list 
appears. The Delete link appears in the drop-down list for your selection. 
Select the Del link to delete the dashboard.
•	 Build: Click the New Dashboard that appears to the right of the Reports & 
Dashboards heading, or the folder icon to the right of the Find a Folder 
search bar.

CHAPTER 24  Seeing the Big Picture with Dashboards      401
Building dashboard folders
From the Reports tab, which takes you to the Reports & Dashboards home page, 
you can also create and edit folders. Editing a folder is easy when you understand 
how to create one.
To create a folder, follow these steps:
1.	 On the Reports page, click the Folder icon to the right of the Find a Folder 
search bar and select the New Dashboard Folder option in the Folder 
drop-down list.
A New Dashboard Folder page appears.
2.	 Type an intuitive name for the folder in the Dashboard Folder field.
For example, if you want a folder for only senior management, you might 
name it Executive Dashboards.
3.	 Use the Public Folder Access field to determine read versus read/write 
privileges for the folder.
4.	 Use the radio buttons to select who should have access to the folder.
Your choices are All, None, and Selective.
5.	 If you chose Selective in Step 4, highlight Groups or Roles in the Available for 
Sharing list box and add them to the Shared To list box.
6.	 Click Save.
The folder list page reappears. Now you can add dashboards or move existing 
dashboards to the new folder, which we explain in the section “Modifying dash-
board properties,” earlier in this chapter.
When naming folders, dashboards, and dashboard reports, consider using a stan-
dard numbering convention. For example, you could name the senior manage-
ment folder 1.0 Executive Dashboards. Then the executive sales subordinate 
dashboard might be 1.1 and the executive marketing dashboard 1.2. By using a 
standard numbering methodology, you can more efficiently create, clone, and 
organize dashboards and dashboard reports.

alesforce.com drives much of its feature updates based on its existing road map 
and requests from customers just like you. A few times a year, Salesforce.com 
comes out with a new release of its award-winning service. That’s the benefit 
of these cloud-based business applications, because the infrastructure isn’t main-
tained by you. Unlike traditional software upgrades, these releases are immediately 
available to all customers, and most features can be activated or deactivated when 
you’re ready to make the change.
Keeping track of all the cool new updates that Salesforce.com releases can get a 
little overwhelming. The speed with which it’s able to roll out releases is often 
faster than our ability to write all about it and get it in your hands! On the flip side, 
perhaps you do keep track of the newest features but you’ve been struggling with 
an apparent feature limitation or you’d like more advice on how to best implement 
a particular feature.
Fortunately for us, both Salesforce.com and its community of users strongly 
believe in helping each other out to make every customer successful. Through a 
variety of channels, the Salesforce.com community shares best practices and offers 
suggestions and workarounds for even the toughest head-scratcher questions.
In this chapter, we introduce you to ten resources and tools that will help you get 
the most out of Salesforce. The first five sections cover essential resources that 
Chapter 25

406      PART 8  The Part of Tens
every user in your organization should know about. The last five sections fill you 
in on great productivity tools that you may have overlooked.
Salesforce Trailhead
Whether you’re an administrator or end-user, bookmark Salesforce Trailhead 
(https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead) now. Here you’ll find inter-
active modules with real examples that help you learn various aspects of Sales-
force. As you complete modules in various tracks, you’ll earn badges that you can 
proudly share online.
Dreamforce Conference
Dreamforce (www.salesforce.com/dreamforce) is Salesforce.com’s annual prod-
uct conference that brings together developers, system administrators, and end-
user business folks to learn from, network with, and party alongside product 
experts from Salesforce.com, as well as the ecosystem at large. Make the trek to 
San Francisco, and get inspired with all the great things Salesforce can do for your 
company.
Salesforce Success Community
Online within the Salesforce Success Community (http://success.salesforce.
com), you can post or vote for new product ideas, see what other users are request-
ing, and ask and answer questions related to configuration or code. Not only do 
you get to see what the masses are clamoring for, but you also get to see Sales-
force.com employees, partners, and customers joining together to provide feed-
back and assistance.
Salesforce.com Local User Groups
One of the best ways to regularly find out about upcoming features, hear about 
third-party vendor integrations, network with your peers, and provide product 
feedback is to join a local user group. You’ll get to learn from and share 
tips with fellow customers in your vicinity. To find out if one exists near you, go 

CHAPTER 25  Ten Ways to Drive More Productivity      407
to the Salesforce Success Community (https://success.salesforce.com/­
featuredGroups), and click the All User Groups by Region category in the left 
sidebar. If you don’t see your city, think about starting your own group.
Salesforce.com Training
One of the best ways to become an expert and have an opportunity to ask an expert 
about your company’s particular use of Salesforce is to be trained by Salesforce.
com. Then you can be your company’s expert and spearhead further ideas of using 
Salesforce to make your business processes run smoother. You find classes for 
every user role, and for every budget. If you’ll be configuring and customizing 
Salesforce, you can find a series of certifications so that you can tell others just 
how special you are. Visit Salesforce University (www.salesforce.com/services-
training/training_certification/training.jsp) and look for options that 
meet your budget and learning style.
Conga Composer
If you need to generate documents that include fields from Salesforce, as well as 
more static fields (like information on a quote, or legal contracts), the Conga 
Composer app (available on the AppExchange) helps you quickly build Microsoft 
document templates or Adobe Acrobat PDFs from within Salesforce. This elimi-
nates the need to build complicated macros or forms (sometimes within Microsoft 
Excel or Word), while still taking advantage of the sophisticated text customiza-
tion options within Microsoft products.
Field Trip
Fields in Salesforce remind us of barnacles on a boat. Over time, custom fields get 
created, some get abandoned, and they grow and grow over time. On a regular 
basis, you should slough off those unused fields, just like barnacles are scraped off 
a boat. Abandoned fields can clutter up your instance with redundant-sounding 
fields that also clog up the report-building experience, and make onboarding new 
hires tedious when people can’t remember when a field is used or not.
Field Trip (available on the AppExchange) is a free app that does some analysis on 
fields in an object, and lets you know what percentage of those object records have 
data in that field. Of course, you need a sense as to what percentage an often-used 

408      PART 8  The Part of Tens
field might have, so you can compare that to a less-used field. This tool gives you 
an initial start when it comes to cleaning up abandoned fields.
DupeCatcher
Salesforce has a native duplicate management feature, but DupeCatcher (an app 
available on the AppExchange) is a simpler option to help lower the chances of 
duplicate data making it into Salesforce. You’ll have to know what specific fields 
need to match in order to determine that two records are a duplicate. You can cre-
ate alerts that prevent users from saving potential duplicates. The alerts may be 
associated with any existing leads, contacts, or accounts with matching criteria, 
as well as leads with existing potential matches in the post-conversion world of 
contacts and accounts. Pretty nifty for something with a free price tag!
Rollup Helper
If you work with sales teams, you’ll inevitably hear requests around accounts, 
their related parent accounts or child accounts, and how to best report on aggre-
gate numbers across levels of accounts. For example, large multinational compa-
nies may be composed of several accounts linked together. Someone will want to 
analyze revenue from the ultimate parent level, or perhaps from the middle of the 
hierarchy to gauge regional revenue. Doing this out-of-the-box using Sales-
force’s parent account feature can be a challenge. Rollup Helper (an app available 
on the AppExchange) helps with that aggregation.
Mass Update and Mass Edit
Mass Update and Mass Edit (available on the AppExchange) allows two custom but-
tons to appear on a custom list view page, or on a related list. It allows you to do 
what the name implies — select a lot of records at once to either make the same 
change to one common field (that’s the mass update), or select a bunch of records 
so they all display at multiple rows in edit mode, so you can change fields to what-
ever values you want to (that’s the mass edit). You could use the app to perform a 
mass update of record owners to a single new sales user. And if you need to update 
the Next Steps field on your top-25 largest opportunities before the Monday morn-
ing meeting, you can use the app to select all those records and perform a mass edit. 
This allows you to type in each opportunity’s unique next step, but without having 
to open up multiple tabs or use multiple mouse clicks to open each individual record.

Ten Keys to a 
Successful 
Implementation
S
everal companies have rolled out customer relationship management (CRM) 
applications with the mistaken notion that you can buy the licenses, turn on 
the switch, and use the application as soon as you take it out of the box. Then 
these same companies look back months later and wonder why they’re not expe-
riencing the results they envisioned.
Nine times out of ten, the root cause is poor planning. No matter what size your 
implementation, building a strong plan and then executing the plan will substan-
tially improve your chance of success.
Salesforce provides you with the tools and a platform to enhance your business 
effectiveness and productivity. If you’re involved in the rollout of Salesforce, this 
chapter gives you ten tips to help you do it successfully. Check out the free webi-
nars, answers, and more on the Salesforce Community site (http://success.

Chapter 26

Identifying Your Executive Sponsor
Rolling out or replacing a CRM solution is a big deal. For some managers and reps, 
this initiative can cause concerns for a variety of reasons: People get set in their 
ways, they think it’s Big Brother, they assume that it’s going to take a lot of their 
time, and so on. Sometimes other top priorities at work begin creeping in, and the 
importance of the CRM implementation falls along the wayside.
Every project needs a champion to help drive the CRM initiative in your company. 
That person is there to rally support, break logjams, and ensure that your team 
has the resources to get things done. We recommend that you identify an execu-
tive sponsor on day one and work with her so that she can communicate what’s in 
it for the implementation team and set expectations for what’s needed from all 
participants. This will go a long way toward calming fears, gaining support and 
commitment, and nudging the team toward a decision when the team members 
are at an impasse.
Building Your Project Team
CRM is less about technology and more about people, human processes, and your 
business. For your company to get the most out of Salesforce, you need to develop 
a team made up of critical stakeholders, Salesforce experts, and a cross section of 
end-users. If you’re implementing Salesforce for sales and marketing, that might 
mean that the team includes managers from marketing, sales operations, and IT, 
some respected sales reps, and hopefully a member of your executive team. This 
team doesn’t have to be huge, nor should members expect to be involved in this 
project full-time. But you must have people who can speak for the business, and 
you must have the resources you need to get the job done. Get every stakeholder 
to understand the team’s objectives and to buy in from the first meeting.
Evaluating Your Processes
Conduct business process reviews as key elements to your planning process. Those 
meetings should include a key stakeholder (or stakeholders) who can speak for the 
business and to the CRM project team (for example, a channel sales session with 
the head of channel sales). By doing this, you gain further agreement to your plan 
and ensure that you’re building a solution that meets existing or desired processes 
of managers and their teams.

CHAPTER 26  Ten Keys to a Successful Implementation      411
Gathering Requirements
Think about why you’re implementing Salesforce. Is it to increase sales, improve 
productivity, encourage collaboration, or all three? Because it’s nearly impossible 
to implement anything correctly unless you know your goal, make your objectives 
measurable by applying specific success metrics to an objective. (A success metric is 
a numerical goal that you want to achieve, ideally within a specified time frame.) 
For example, it’s one thing to say that you want to reduce customer service 
response time, and it’s quite another to define that you want to reduce response 
time by 20 percent by the end of the year. It’s important to choose the right metric 
to measure your company’s progress.
Defining Your Scope and  
Prioritizing Initiatives
You can do a lot with Salesforce, but the more complex, the longer the implemen-
tation will likely take and the greater the chance you’ll hit a snag. As you collect 
the requirements of key stakeholders, prioritize initiatives and determine what’s 
in scope and out of scope for the initial implementation. Consider keeping the 
implementation limited by focusing on the major priorities. Then you can extend 
your initiatives by building on prior success.
Modeling Salesforce to Your Business
After you evaluate your company’s business processes and gather scope require-
ments from your steering committee, you want to model Salesforce to your 
­business. However, we realize that you’re probably new to Salesforce and may 
have some questions as to what information should go where. For your company, 
what are leads, accounts, contacts, and opportunities? Make sure that you check 
out the various process maps on the Salesforce Success Community website 
(http://success.salesforce.com) before you start customizing Salesforce. If 
you still have questions, make sure to ask your peers on the community forums or 
contact your customer success manager for guidance.

412      PART 8  The Part of Tens
Customizing for User Relevance
When designing records and layouts, keeping it simple isn’t always appropriate. 
Some businesses do have complex needs. Just be aware that long, complicated 
records can affect end-user adoption, so don’t build a field unless you think end-
users will use it. Focus your customization on relevancy to your users. Standardize 
information as often as possible, using picklists rather than free text fields, which 
will help with more accurate reporting. For fields that have to be text fields (such 
as the Opportunity Name), work out a simple standard naming convention.
As you accomplish major milestones (such as customization of different records 
or layouts), validate your work with a representative of your end-users. By doing 
this, you can make sure at key points that you’re building a solution that works for 
your internal customer.
Importing Clean Data
Identify your data sources that you want to bring over to Salesforce. Note where 
the information is coming from, what format it will be in, and how clean it’ll be.
Armed with this information, you can discuss with your team the scope of your 
migration. Moving into Salesforce means that it’s time for some spring cleaning. 
Work with your team to identify which data sources are the most valuable and 
whether your end-users will benefit from all that information coming over.
Data that doesn’t make it to Salesforce doesn’t necessarily disappear. You can 
always archive it or keep it in the legacy system.
After you decide what data is going into Salesforce, you have to clean it. Scrubbing 
data isn’t glamorous, but it has to be done. Reducing duplicates and ensuring 
consistency not only make Salesforce more valuable but also improve your users’ 
adoption. If you don’t have the resources to do this, check out the AppExchange 
(www.salesforce.com/appexchange) for partners that help with data cleansing.
Building a Comprehensive Training Plan
As early as you can in the implementation process, start building a training plan. 
Don’t assume that users will know what to do. And don’t just rely on the generic 
sales training offered by Salesforce.com — it may not be relevant enough to your 

CHAPTER 26  Ten Keys to a Successful Implementation      413
customization. Blend prerequisite classes, custom sales training, and reinforce-
ment training in your plan. The key is to make sure that enough relevant training 
is provided so that people effectively and correctly use the Salesforce application. 
Also, be sure that your end-users have personal copies of this book — just in case.
Connecting with Peers
After your teams are up and running with Salesforce, you should constantly gather 
feedback and track how adoption is faring. Also, get out there and meet your 
peers  — others who have rolled out Salesforce and have advice and stories to 
share. Through online community discussion boards, local user group meetings, 
and Dreamforce (the Salesforce.com annual user conference), you have several 
channels where you can ask questions, seek guidance, and share information that 
can help you take your Salesforce implementation to the next level.

About the Authors
Liz Kao: Liz was an enthusiastic early adopter of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) 
model and has been using Salesforce for more than a decade. An early employee of 
Salesforce.com, she built Salesforce-centric solutions for both external clients 
and internal teams, including launching over one-third of the original applica-
tions on the AppExchange. Combined with a background in sales and marketing, 
she blends a hands-on perspective of business needs with using Salesforce (and 
now, other cloud products) to build solutions that scale. A veteran of the enter-
prise software industry, Liz lives in San Francisco. When she isn’t busy keeping up 
with the latest enterprise software cloud products and features, she’s enjoying all 
the culinary delights and Internet-signal-free natural surroundings of Northern 
California.
Jon Paz: Jon, a Salesforce consultant, has worked with enterprise clients to deliver 
world-class solutions to perplexing business challenges. Previously, he worked as 
an editor for a major international organization. After working with various cli-
ents and industries to implement cloud technologies, Jon has witnessed the trans-
formative value of the product. He is an avid globetrotter, can talk to you about 
your business in five different languages, and is a staunch advocate for the legal-
ization of unpasteurized cheeses!
Dedication
To friends, family, and former co-workers who have supported me in this journey 
since the first edition. Thank you for your wisdom, insights, patience, and ­laughter 
every step of the way.
—Liz Kao
To my family, friends, and those who blur the line between the two. Thanks for 
putting up with me through the writing process, all the way to the finish line.
—Jon Paz

flexibility, and positive attitude. And finally, thanks to the innovators and evan-
gelists at Salesforce.com. You made enterprise software applications fun to write 
about (we’re serious!), and your continuous innovation over the years keeps us
