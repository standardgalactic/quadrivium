Preface 
The nucleic acids are, in the main, informational macromolecules. DNA 
encodes the instructions that are passed on from parents to progeny, so 
that the offspring of two human beings is another human being, rather 
than any other life form. The related molecule RNA serves the same 
function in some viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HTV). The nucleic acids are, therefore, responsible for the continuation of 
all forms of life on this Earth, and as such are the subject of enormous 
interest to biologists. 
Why should the student of chemistry be interested in them? The answer 
is that the biological roles of the nucleic acids can only be understood in 
terms of their chemical structures, and chemists have played a central part 
in establishing those structures and the understanding of how they 
function. The main objectives of this book are to explain what those 
structures are, how they were determined, and how function can be 
understood in terms of structure. 
Although the nucleic acids are interesting substances in their own right, 
the real fascination of their study comes from the interplay between their 
chemistry and biology. Indeed, it is not really possible to disentangle the 
two, since some of the modern methods for the determination of the 
structures of nucleic acids make use of their biological properties. Nucleic 
acid chemistry cannot, therefore, be fully understood without some 
knowledge of the underlying biology. Consequently, some of the more 
important aspects of the fields of molecular biology and genetics are 
covered in Chapter 1, and in boxed inaterial throughout the rest of the 
book for the benefit of those readers who lack the necessary background 
knowledge. 
There is also a substantial amount of material in this book about the 
history of the subject. Study of the structure and function of nucleic acids 
has occupied the attention of a large number of enormously talented 
scientists over the last 130 years. This is reflected in the very large number 
of Nobel Prizes that have been awarded in the field. A proper 
understanding of the present state of our knowledge of the nucleic acids 
is, I believe, greatly illuminated by knowing something of how we arrived 
at it. It is, by any criterion, a remarkable story of scientific endeavour.

The Biological Roles of 
the Nucleic Acids 
I .I Introduction 
This book is intended mainly for students of chemistry, and so the 
emphasis is on the chemistry of the nucleic acids. It is, however, difficult 
to talk about the chemistry of these molecules without reference to their 
biological properties and functions. Indeed, some of the methods used to 
determine the structures of nucleic acids make use of those biological 
properties (see Chapter 5). In addition, of course, the biology of the 
nucleic acids is a fascinating subject because they are the molecules on 
which the continuation of life depends. 
Most readers of this book will have studied at least a little biology at 
school, and will probably be aware in outline of what DNA is and what it 
does. Indeed, living in the modern world it is difficult to avoid hearing 
such terms as genes, genomes, genetic engineering and DNA fingerprint- 
ing in general usage. Nevertheless, it seems a good idea to start off with a 
brief account of what the nucleic acids do, and how they do it, to set the 
scene for what comes after. It will be easier to understand the significance 
of individual parts of the chemical story if the student has a broad 
overview of the biology. Students who are familiar with the topic may 
want to skip this chapter and move straight on to the more chemical 
material that follows. On the other hand, readers who are interested in

the biology can find more extensive treatments in the books listed under 
Further Reading. 
As well as a basic overview, this chapter (and later ones to a lesser 
extent) also contains a substantial amount of boxed material which 
essentially has to do with the early history of the development of ideas 
about genetics and molecular biology. This is partly to correct a common 
misapprehension that the study of DNA started in the last couple of 
decades of the 20th century. In fact it started in the middle of the 19th 
century, and it seems a shame not to be aware of the contributions that 
some of the major figures in the field made in those earlier years. In 
addition, it might be thought unsatisfactory to accept ideas such as DNA 
being the carrier of genetic information without knowing something 
about the evidence on which the claim is made. Study of this historical 
material is not essential to understanding the bulk of the text, but not to 
do so risks failing to appreciate the importance of the contributions made 
by earlier generations of scientists working in the field. 
1.2 
Classes of Nucleic Acids 
We need to recognize from the start that there are two classes of nucleic 
acids. Both are polymers having a backbone of alternating mono- 
saccharide and phosphate units, each of the sugars carrying one of four 
possible heterocyclic bases (shown schematically in 1). The main dif- 
ference is that in one class the polymer backbone contains 2-deoxyribose, 
and the molecule is referred to as deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In the 
other class the deoxyribose is replaced by ribose, and correspondingly the 
molecule is referred to as ribonucleic acid or RNA. We will use these 
abbreviations throughout the rest of the book. There is also a difference 
in that DNA and RNA have three of the heterocyclic bases in common, 
but one is different. We will return to this in Chapter 2, which deals with 
the details of the covalent structures of the nucleic acids.

DNA as the Carrier of Genetic Information 
The offspring of two human beings is also a human being, with all the 
essential characteristics of that species. This is because both the egg and 
the sperm carry a set of instructions for making a new human being. 
Similarly, when a cell divides, the result is two identical cells each 
with the same genetic information. This genetic information is encoded in 
DNA molecules.

Nucleic Acids 
The DNA in cells of higher organisms is contained in structures called 
chromosomes, each of which is composed of a (very large) molecule of 
DNA and many copies of several different proteins (see Section 3.4). The 
total DNA of an organism is referred to as its genome and the individual 
units of information in the genome are called genes. In bacteria, most of 
the genetic information is contained in a single chromosome, but many 
bacteria also contain extra genetic information in small DNA molecules 
called plasmids.

The genetic material has two essential characteristics. Firstly, it must 
be capable of being copied exactly. So, for example, when a bacterial cell 
divides, two identical copies of the DNA that it contains must be 
synthesized so that one copy can be passed to each of the daughter cells 
produced. How the structure of DNA allows for its replication is 
explained in Chapter 3. 
The other characteristic is that the genetic information must be 
expressed. That is, the information that the DNA contains must 
be interpreted in some way so that the cell in which it is contained does 
the right things. The information in DNA is largely a set of instructions 
for making proteins, but in addition it also codes for the structures of 
some RNA molecules which play a central part in protein synthesis (see 
Sections 1.5 and 1.7).

nature of the side chain (the group R in structure 2). Table 1.2 gives a list 
of the 19 amino acids that are specified by the genetic code along with the 
structures of their side chains. Also given are two abbreviations for each 
’ amino acid. The first is a three-letter abbreviation which is generally the 
first three letters of the name of the amino acid. The second is a single- 
letter code. The initial letter of the name is used for some of the amino 
acids (generally those that occur most commonly in proteins), but this is 
not always possible because there are several cases where two or more 
amino acids have the same initial letter. So, for example, the abbreviation 
for alanine is A but that for aspartic acid is D. It might seem unnecessarily 
confusing to use the single-letter codes but, as we will see later, they are 
very useful when the structures of large proteins have to be recorded 
either in paper form or electronically.

name and one-letter abbreviation are Pro and P respectively. 
The amino acids in proteins are linked together by an amide linkage

protein has the general structure shown in (4); that is, it consists of a 
string of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. The value of n in 
structure 4 can be as small as zero (when the molecule is called a dipeptide) 
or as large as several thousand. Small molecules with up to about 20 or 30 
amino acids are generally referred to as peptides (or polypeptideb or 
oligopeptides - these terms are interchangeable), whereas larger molecules 
are referred to as proteins. The point at which the nomenclature changes 
is not clear cut, and indeed is not very important; the important thing is 
that peptides are small proteins.

An example of the structure of a pentapeptide (five amino acid 
residues) is shown in 5. The first important thing to note about this 
structure is that it has two unique ends. That at the left has a free a-amino 
group and is referred to as the N-terminus. At the other end there is a free 
a-carboxylic acid group; this is referred to as the C-terminus. Peptides and 
proteins are always represented this way around. This becomes important 
when the structures are written in shorthand form. Reference to Table 1.2 
shows that the peptide in 5 contains one residue of each of the amino acids 
alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, lysine and serine; this is referred to as its 
amino acid composition. The structure can be written in shorthand as 
Gly-Lys-Ser-Asp-Ala or, even shorter, as GKSDA; these are two ways of 
writing the amino acid sequence or primary structure of the peptide. Both 
of these mean exactly the same to a protein chemist as the structure shown 
in 5. Note that it is now very important to observe the convention that the 
N-terminus is at the left. The peptide ADSKG has the same amino acid 
composition as 5 but has a different amino acid sequence; that is, it has a 
different structure (see Problem 1.1).

The usefulness of these shorthand representations becomes obvious as 
soon as we wish to present the structures of even small proteins. 
For example, 6 is the structure of the protein insulin. It consists of two 
chains of amino acids. The A-chain contains 21 residues and the B-chain 
contains 30. An interesting feature of insulin is that it contains disulfide 
bridges. These are formed by oxidation of pairs of cysteine residues by the 
process shown in Scheme 1.4; the product of the reaction is called cystine. 
These bridges are formed after the protein has been synthesized; the 
presence of cystine in a protein is not specified by the genetic code. Two of 
the three disulfide bridges link the A and B chains together, whereas the 
third is internal in the A chain.

1.5 
Transcription of DNA into RNA 
In eukaryotic cells, protein synthesis takes place in the cytosolic 
compartment, whereas the genetic material is located in the nucleus. 
Moreover, individual genes are located on the chromosonies, which are 
very large structures. So how is the information contained in the gene for 
a particular protein transferred from the nucleus to the cytosol? The 
answer is that the section of DNA coding for the protein is transcribed 
into a molecule of RNA which contains the same information as that in 
the gene, but in a slightly different form. This RNA can leave the nucleus 
through pores in the nuclear membrane, and so carries the genetic 
message into the cytosol. Appropriately, molecules of this sort are called 
messenger RNA or mRNA. Even in prokaryotic cells, which do not have a 
nucleus, mRNA still performs this function of acting as an intermediary 
between DNA as the store of genetic information and the machinery 
where protein synthesis occurs. 
The details of the process of transcription are dealt with in Chapter 4, 
but a brief outline is required here as an aid to understanding the following 

16 
Nucleic Acids 
sections. As previously stated, DNA is a linear polymer made from four 
difierent monomeric units. For the moment we will simply represent the 
monomers by the letters A, G, C and T and look at their structures in detail 
in Chapter 2. RNA similarly is a polymer made from four monomeric 
units. Three of these are also A, G and C, but instead of T, RNA 
contains U. In transcription, a complementary mRNA is synthesized using 
a section of the DNA molecule as a template. The process is such that: 
Wherever A occurs in the DNA, U occurs in the RNA 
Wherever T occurs in the DNA, A occurs in the RNA 
Wherever G occurs in the DNA, C occurs in the RNA 
Wherever C occurs in the DNA, G occurs in the RNA 
So, for example, a section of a DNA niolecule and its mRNA transcript 
might have the base sequences shown below: 
DNA : CTGMGTCGTACCTGGGAATGTTTC 
mRNA : GACUUCAGCAUGGACCCUUACAAAG 
The genetic message contained in the base sequence of 
molecule has been transcribed into the same message encoded 
sequence of the mRNA. 
1.6 
How the Message is Decoded 
the DNA 
in the base 
Just as the structure of a protein is defined by the order in which its 
constituent amino acid residues occur in the polypeptide chain, so the 
structure of an mRNA molecule is defined by the order in which its 
constituent units occur in the so-called polynucleotide chain. 
The problem is, then: how does a code consisting of a string of the four 
letters of mRNA become translated into the sequence of the 20 amino acids 
in the primary structure of a protein? The answer is that the bases are read 
in non-overlapping triplets, and each triplet specifies one amino acid in the 
protein. These triplets are known as codons. Given that the combination of 
any three bases out of four leads to 64 possible triplets, and there are only 
20 amino acids to code for (strictly, 19 amino acids plus proline), there 
appears to be some redundancy in the system. In fact, it turns out that 
some, indeed most, of the amino acids are coded by more than one triplet. 
The genetic code is shown in Table 1.3. The amino acid coded by any 
given triplet is obtained by identifying the set of four rows corresponding 
to the first base shown in the column on the left of the table, then finding 
the column corresponding to the second base, and finally the row within 
that column corresponding to the third base. For example, the triplet 
CAU codes for His (second set of four rows, third column, and then the 

The Biological Roles of the Nucleic Acids 
17 
first entry). There are some points of special interest in this table. Firstly, 
three of the triplets (UAA, UGA and UAG) do not code for amino acids. 
Rather, they are stop signals, or termination codons; that is, when protein 
synthesis reaches one of these codons, the process stops and the last 
amino acid incorporated before this point becomes the C-terminus of the 
completed protein. What is the codon for the start of synthesis? It turns 
out that it is AUG. This triplet always codes for methionine, but 
depending on the context within the mRNA, it either signals the start of 
synthesis of a new protein, or for the insertion of an internal Met residue. 
This does not mean that all proteins have methionine at the N-terminus - 
this residue is usually removed to leave the amino acid coded by the triplet 
after the initiation codon as the N-terminus of the completed protein.

The other notable feature is that most amino acids are coded by at least 
two triplets, and some by as many as six. In many cases, all four triplets 
with the same first two bases code for the same amino acid. For example, 
Pro is coded by CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG. This has important 
consequences. For example, it means that if the third base in such triplets 
is mutated (see Section 3.6.1), then the amino acid incorporated in the 
protein chain does not change. On the other hand, if the triplet CAU was 
to be mutated into CAA, then the result would be a change in the amino 
acid incorporated from His to Gln, with possible functional effects on the 
protein coded by the gene.

Nucleic Acids 
A very important concept in protein coding is that of the reading frame. 
To see what is meant by this, consider a short stretch of mRNA in the 
middle of a gene transcript with the base sequence UUCCACAGU- 
GUUAUAUCCGGCUGGG. What does it code for'? If we assume that 
the first base in the given sequence is the first base of a codon, then we can 
split the sequence up as shown below and look up the corresponding 
amino acids in Table 1.3: 
(UUC I CAC 1 AGU [ GUU 1 AUA I UCC I GGC I UGG 1 G 
P h e  -His-Ser 
- V a l - I l e - S e r - G l y - T r p  
Note that the final G is the first base of the next triplet. What if we assume 
that the first base in the given sequence is, in fact, the last one of the 
previous triplet? The sequence then splits up as follows. 
U I UCC I ACA 1 GUG I UUA I UAU 1 CCG I GCU I GGG 
Ser - Thr - V a l  -Leu- 
T y r  - Pro - A l a - G l y  
The result is a completely different protein sequence because the reading 
frame has changed. Obviously, there is yet a third reading frame possible, 
where the first two bases belong to the previous triplet (see Problem 1.3). 
When translation of an mRNA occurs in the cell, the selection of the 
initiation codon fixes the reading frame for the rest of the message.

Protein Synthesis 
The processes of protein synthesis are extremely complicated and will not 
be dealt with in detail until Chapter 4, but a brief summary is required to 
complete the overview. The site of synthesis is a particle called the 
ribosome. This is a very complex structure made of protein and RNA. In 
prokaryotes, the ribosome has an Mr of about 2,700,000 and a diameter 
of about 20 nm, so it is a very large structure indeed. Ribosomes were 
originally characterized by their sedimentation coefficients, and that in 
prokaryotes is often referred to as the 70s ribosome. 
Tt can be dissociated into two parts, called the 30s subunit and the 
50s subunit, which can be further broken down into their constituent 
protein and RNA components. The 30s subunit consists of 21 different 
protein molecules and a 16s RNA species. The larger subunit consists 
of 36 proteins molecules and two RNA molecules, one of 23s and the 
other of 5s. The structures of these RNA molecules are, of course, 
specified by the genetic information contained in DNA, and are 
synthesized in just the same way as is mRNA. The eukaryotic ribosome 
is somewhat bigger, but the structural features are similar and the 
differences need not concern us. 
It used to be thought that the RNA molecules, which account for 
about two-thirds of the mass of the ribosome, were essentially structural 
and that the protein components were responsible for carrying out the 
reactions involved in protein synthesis. This view has now changed, 
and it has become clear that the RNA species play central roles in 
those chemical events. Catalysis of reactions by RNA is the topic of 
Box 4.2. 
Let us turn to the events of protein synthesis. We know that the base 
sequence of mRNA contains the information for the amino acid sequence 
of the protein to be produced. The question is how this information is 
used to put the amino acids in the correct order. Again, RNA molecules 
are centrally involved. There exists a set of small RNA molecules 
(containing between 73 and 93 monomeric units) called transfer RNA, or 
tKNA, which act as adaptors between the mRNA and the amino acids 
which are to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. Each tRNA can be 
loaded with a specific amino acid, and each has a region in its structure 
that recognizes the triplet codon for the amino acid that it carries (see 
Section 4.4). In essence, then, the mRNA combines with the ribosome 
and provides the template for the protein chain to be built up. Each triplet 
of bases is recognized by a tRNA molecule carrying the required amino 
acid for that position in the protein chain, and the amino acid is attached 
to the growing chain. Eventually a termination codon is reached and 
synthesis stops.

1.8 
The cLCentral 
Dogma” of Molecular Biology 
This is a phrase coined by Francis Crick (see Chapter 3 for an account of 
Crick’s major contribution to the study of DNA) to emphasize the 
essentially unidirectional flow of information in living organisms. It can 
be summarized by the sequence: 
DNA -+ RNA -+ Protein 
That is, the information in DNA is transcribed into information in RNA, 
and the latter is then translated into the structure of protein. This is 
essentially the process that has been summarized in the discussion above. 
This scheme is now known to be incomplete, and should be properly be 
written as: 
DNA + RNA -+ Protein 

22 
Nucleic Acids 
That is, in some circumstances, information can flow from RNA to 
DNA. This is a process restricted to certain viruses called retroviruses, 
of which the best known is, perhaps, the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), which is thought to be the causative agent of AIDS. Organisms 
like this have an enzyme called reverse transcriptasc which they use to 
transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA. Once this has happened, the 
normal machinery of the host cell transcribes the DNA to make multiple 
copies of the viral RNA, which can be used both as a messenger to make 
viral proteins, and as the genome for further copies of the virus. 
The last part of the central dogma appears, however, to be sacrosanct. 
There is no known situation in which the information in protein structure 
can be translated back into the structure of a nucleic acid.

2.1 
The Building Bricks 
As outlined in Section 1.2, both DNA and RNA are polymeric molecules 
with backbones consisting of alternating monosaccharide and phosphate 
units. Each of the monosaccharide components carries one of four 
possible heterocyclic bases. In both cases, two of these bases are derivatives 
of pyrimidine (l), and the other two are derivatives of purine (2). 
The pyrimidines in RNA are cytosine (4-amino-2-hydroxypyrimidine, 
3) 
and uracil (2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine, 4). The purines are adenine 
(6-aminopurine, 5) and guanine (2-amino-6-hydroxypurine, 6). The 
same two purines occur in DNA, but one of the pyrimidines is different. 
Instead of uracil the fourth base in DNA is thymine (5-methyluracil, 7).

It might not be immediately obvious why, for example, cytosine is 
4-amino-2-hydroxypyrimidine. 
The point here is that the hydroxyl- 
containing purines and pyrimidines show tautomerism. So cytosine can 
exist as either of the two forms shown in Scheme 2. I ,  and the naming is 
that of the lactim form. As we shall see latter, it is the lactams that are 
found in the nucleic acids.

The monosaccharide in RNA is 13-D-ribofuranose. This is a five-carbon 
sugar (a pentose) and its structure is shown in 8, with the numbering of the 
carbon atoms indicated. The structure in 8 is only one of the forms that 
ribose can adopt (see Box 2. l), but it is the one invariably found in RNA, 
and in this context it is common practice to refer to it simply as ribose. 
Note that, in most of what follows, the hydrogen atoms on carbons 1-4 
will be omitted for clarity. 
The monosaccharide in DNA is the closely related Lj-2-deoxy- 
1,-ribofuranose, usually known simply as deoxyribose, in which the

its effects on the properties of the nucleic acids are profound (see, for 
example, Box 2.4). The base and sugar components of the nucleic acids 
are summarized in Table 2.1.

Nucleosides and Nucleotides 
The individual components of the nucleic acids had been discovered by 
complete degradation, followed by analysis of the molecules liberated. 
The next problem was how these components are linked together in the 
intact molecule. Solution to this problem came from study of the products 
of partial hydrolysis of the nucleic acids. These are of two types, 
nucleosides and nucleotides . 
Ribonucleosides are molecules containing a base linked to C-1 of ribose. 
Typical examples are adenosine (9-P-~-ribofuranosyladenine, 20) and 
cytidine (1-P-D-ribofuranosylcytosine, 21). Note that the linkage is to N-1 
of the pyrimidine ring and to N-9 of the purine ring.

There is an entirely analogous set of molecules called dcol? rihoiiuclco-

deoxyadenosine, for example, has the same structure as 20, but with 
deoxyribose replacing ribose. Table 2.2 lists the names of the nucleosides 
formed by the bases commonly found in RNA and DNA.

Nucleotides are phosphate motwesftm of nucleosides. Taking adenosine 
as an example, there are three possible hydroxyl groups that could be 
esterified, and all three compounds are known. Their structures are 
shown in 28-30. Compound 28 is adenosine 5’-monophosphate, 29 is 
adenosine 3’-monophosphate, and 30 is adenosine 2’-monophosphate.

The Inter-nucleotide Linkage 
Both DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides in which the 
monomeric units are linked by phosphodiester bonds between the

5’-hydroxyl group of one sugar and the 3’-hydroxyl group of the next 
sugar in the chain. This is shown in 33 for a section of a DNA 
molecule and in 34 for a section of an RNA molecule. In both cases the 
sugar-phosphate backbone is shown in red, and the attached bases in 
black. The “squiggly bonds” at the ends indicate that the chains carry on 
in both directions. 
It is important to note that the chain is directional; that is, the two ends 
are not the same. If the phosphodiester bonds to the next residues in the 
chain in both directions were broken, then the end at the top in 33 would 
have a free OH on the 5’- position of the deoxyribose, whereas the end at 
the bottom would have the OH on the 3‘- position. Reading from top to 
bottom, the structure is said to be written S’+3’. This directionality is

important when we use shorthand representations of the structure of a 
D N A  chain. 
The structure of RNA is essentially the same as that of DNA, except 
that ribose replaces deoxyribose. Here it is important to note that the 
2’-OH is not involved in the linkage between the sugar units. Note that in 
both structures, the phosphate is shown as being negatively charged. This 
will always be the case except in solutions of high acidity.

Shorthand Notations 
It is clearly cumbersome to draw the complete covalent structures of 
even small sections of nucleic acids such as those shown in 33 and 34, 
and rapidly becomes impossible as the sizes of the molecules increase. 
Shorthand notations are therefore used. 
In 33, the deoxyribonucleosides in the chain, reading from the 5’-end, 
are deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine 
and deoxythymidine. If we represent these by the letters A, C, T, G and 
T, the structure in 33 can be written as pApCpTpGpTp. Note that the 
convention is to write the 5’-end of the chain on the left. Although this 
representation is very compact, it is not really necessary to put the “p” 
in between each deoxyribonucleoside since the structure of DNA 
requires it to be there. So we can simplify further to pACTGTp. To the 
nucleic acid chemist, this means just the same as the structure in 33. As 
well as being more compact, representing the structures of DNA 
molecules as simply a string of four letters is ideal for storing them 
electronically, as we will see in Section 5.9. 

The Covalent Structures of Nucleic Acids 
39 
~~ 
~ 
The RNA molecule in 34 can be dealt with in just the same way. That 
is, its structure can be written as pApCpUpGpUp or, more simply, as 
pACUGUp. How do we know that this is a section of an RNA molecule 
rather than DNA? The answer is, of course, that RNA contains uridine, 
whereas DNA does not (except in very rare circumstances; see margin 
note on page 25). 

40 
Nucleic Acids 
2.5 
Oligonucleotides 
~~ 
~~~~~ 
The structures 33 and 34 represent short sections of DNA and RNA 
molecules. Structure 37 is an intact molecule consisting of three 
nucleosides linked together, and is referred to either as a trinucleotide 
or a trimer. Its structure can be represented as pATG following the 
convention that A is the 5’-residue and G is the 3’-residue; the “p” 
indicates that there is a phosphate on the 5’-OH of A. The string of letters 
ATG is referred to as the base sequence of the molecule. This is not strictly 
correct, because the letters really represent nucleosides rather than bases, 
but the terminology is universally used. 
It is worth emphasizing that there is a bit of sloppiness in the 
terminology. Structure 37 is really a trideoxyribonucleotide. It is common 
practice, however, to use the short form trinucleotide provided that the 
context is clear; that is, when we know that we are talking about DNA 
rather than RNA. Similarly, the abbreviated structure should properly 
be written dAdTdG, but the “d”s are implied if the context is DNA. In 
the chapters that follow, the short terms nucleoside and nucleotide will be 
used unless it is necessary, for some reason, to be more specific. Similarly, 
the single letter abbreviations will be used for both nucleosides and bases, 
and only where it is necessary to make a particular point will the “d” be 
included to indicate a deoxyribonucleoside. 

The Covalent Structures of Nucleic Acids 
41 
In general, molecules like 37 are referred to as oligonucleotides (this just 
means a molecule containing a few nucleotides - from the Greek oligoi 
meaning few). For example, AGTAGTCCATAG is an oligonucleotide 
containing 12 residues. It might also be termed, rather inelegantly, a 
12mer. We will see later on (Section 5.10) that synthetic oligonucleotides 
are very important in nucleic acid chemistry. 
2.6 
Sizes of Nucleic Acids 
Nucleic acids are very large molecules. Even the smallest type of RNA 
molecule with which we will be concerned, transfer RNA, contains nearly 
100 nucleotide residues. The 16s ribosomal RNA contains about 1150 
residues. The size of an mRNA molecule depends on the protein for 
which it codes, and can be up to several thousand residues long. 
DNA molecules are generally much larger. The first DNA molecule to 
have its base sequence determined was the genome of the phage 4x174 
(see Box 5.7). This is a very small genome and contains only 5375 
nucleotides. Moving up the scale, mammalian mitochondria1 DNA 
consists of a single molecule of about 15,000 nucleotides (also described 
further in Box 5.7). Next up in size come bacterial genomes. For example, 
that of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which colonizes the human gut, 
contains about 4,500,000 nucleotides in a single chain. In higher 
organisms the DNA is organized into a number of chromosomes (see 
Section 3.4), each of which contains a single molecule of DNA. For 
example, the total genome of the mouse contains about 2,500,000,000 
nucleotides divided up between 20 chromosomes. So on average, each 
chromosome contains 125,000,000 residues. In fact, the sizes of the DNA 
molecules in the mouse genome vary between 58,000,000 and 192,000,000 
residues. How the structures of these enormous molecules are determined 
is described in Section 5.8.

The DNA Double Helix 
3.1.1 The Structure in Outline 
On 25 April 1953, a single-page paper appeared in Nature' which 
revolutionized the understanding of DNA and which won its authors, 
James Watson and Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize. The essential feature 
of their proposal was that the structure consists of two polynucleotide 
chains, each with a right-handed helical structure, coiled around the 
same axis and running anti-parallel to one another (Figure 3.1). 
That is, from top to bottom of the structure, one chain runs 5'43' and 
the other 3'-+5' (see Section 2.3). The sugar-phosphate backbones in

Figure 3.1 are represented by ribbons. Between the ribbons, and 
holding the chains together, are structures shown as rods, each of 
which consists of a pair of bases with their planes perpendicular to 
the axis of the helix. There are 10 pairs of bases for each complete turn 
of the helix; that is, pair number 11 lies directly above pair number 1. 
The vertical distance travelled up the helix axis between each pair of 
bases is 0.34 nm, and so the pitch of the helix (the distance up the 
axis for one complete turn) is 3.4 nm. The diameter of the helix is 
about 2.0 nni. 
Perhaps the most important part of the proposal put forward by 
Watson and Crick was that the bases are Bibdropen bonded together 
(see Box 3.1), and that wherever an adenine occurs in one chain, then a 
thymine must occur in the other. Similarly, wherever guanine occurs in 
one chain, cytosine occurs in the other. Watson and Crick finished their 
paper with what may be the most famous throwaway remark in the 
scientific literature: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing 
we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism 
for the genetic information”. That is, they had effectively solved the 
problem of how genetic material is replicated! We will return to this in 
Section 3.5.

3.1.2 The Structure in Detail 
Figure 3.1 gives only the bare outlines of the structure of DNA. Figure 3.3

We 
cannot go into details of how this technique is carried out, but for the 
interested reader a very good introduction to the subject is given in the 
book by Rhodes." 
The structure in Figure 3.3 is shown as a apuccfill model in which each 
atom is represented as a sphere of radius proportional to its van der 
Waals radius. For clarity, hydrogen atoms are not shown; hydrogens 
occupy all spare valencies. The colour code used in Figure 3.3 is grey

for carbon, black for nitrogen, red for oxygen and light brown for 
phosphorus. The structure is orientated in the same way as is the cartoon 
in Figure 3.1, and so it is easy to trace the two chains through the 
molecule by comparison of the two Figures. 
The merit of a model of this sort is that it allows surface features of 
the molecule to be clearly seen. It should be immediately apparent that 
the phosphate groups are on the outside of the molecule and in 
contact with the solvent. Interaction of the negative charges on the 
phosphates with the dipoles of water molecules is one of the factors 
that stabilizes the structure of DNA (see Section 3.2). It is also clear 
that the bases are in the interior of the molecule, but no details of their 
interactions can be seen. 
The other notable feature of the structure is that it has two grooves 
running diagonally through it. One is much wider than the other and is 
termed the major grooFe. The smaller one is the minor grooie. The edges 
of the bases are exposed in these grooves and provide sites where other 
molecules can interact with the DNA. Interactions with specific proteins 
which are designed to fit into the grooves are very important for 
regulating the expression of genes.

3.1.3 The Structures of the Components of DNA 
Because DNA is such a large complicated molecule, it is difficult to see 
how it is built up and how the component parts interact. To make it 
easier, we will look at the molecule a bit at a time, starting with the 
nucleotide and working up. Figures 3.4-3.9 were all produced by 
extracting the features of interest from the structure of the 12mer 
CGTGAATTCACG. This is entry 1D2912 in the RCSB database, and 
was the structure downloaded in Worked Problem 3.1. 
Figure 3.4 shows a ball-and-stich model of an adenylic acid residue 
extracted from the structure. For small molecules or fragments such as 
this, the ball-and-stick model provides the clearest picture of the 
structure. Atoms are represented by small balls of the appropriate 
colour, and the bonds as sticks joining them. Where a bond joins two 
different atoms, the stick is half one colour and half the other. 
Figure 3.4 Two views of a nucleotide from a DNA molecule. View A is oriented to show the conformation of the deoxyribose ring 
(the C-2' 
atom is indicated). In view B the molecule is rotated to show the planarity of the adenine ring 
Part A of the figure is oriented in such a way as to show the stereo- 
chemistry of the deoxyribose. The Howarth projection of deoxyribose 
(9 in Chapter 2) suggests that the ring is flat, and indeed on geometric 
considerations alone it might be expected to be so. The angles in a regular 
pentagon are 108", which is close to the preferred bond angle of a 
tetrahedral carbon atom (109.5"), and so a planar ring would have little 
bond angle strain. It would, however, have significant steric interaction 
between C-5 and the hydroxyl group on C-1. The steric interactions 
would be even greater in derivatized molecules such as nucleosides. The 
strain is relieved by a conformational shift in which C-2' moves up above 

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
57 
the plane of the ring and C-3’ moves down, so that the ring is puckered as 
shown in Figure 3.4A. Again, for steric reasons, the base is oriented away 
from the sugar-phosphate group. With the deoxyribose ring perpen- 
dicular to the plane of the paper as in Figure 3.4A, the base is 
approximately parallel to that plane. 
Figure 3.4B shows the adenine ring system edge-on, and makes the 
very important point that adenine is planar (as, indeed, are all the bases 
in DNA and RNA). The reason for this is that the bases are aromatic, 
and the formation of the n-electron bonding system requires planarity 
of the rings. 
Moving up to the level of the dinucleotide (Figure 3.9, the beginnings 
of the twist in the backbone can be seen, with the planes of the 
deoxyribose rings inclined to one another. The essential feature here, 
however, is that the planes of the two bases are both perpendicular to the 
plane of the paper. That is, the bases are stacked on top of one another. 
This is possible because rotation can occur around the single bond linking 
C-1’ of the sugar to N-9 of the base (or the N-1 in the case of a 
pyrimidine). This stacking is a key feature of DNA.

In Figure 3.6, we move up in scale to a hexanucleotide sequence; that 
is, one half of a turn of the helix. In this case, a wirefratnc model is used 
in which only the bonds joining the atoms are shown. This is because a 
ball-and-stick representation of a molecule as large as this would be 
very cluttered, making it difficult to see what is going on. We will return 
shortly to why there appear to be two identical copies of the molecule in 
this figure.

Look first at the structure 011 the left of Figure 3.6. Its salient features 
are as follows. Firstly, from bottom to top of the model, the backbone 
goes back into the plane of the paper and then comes forward again; that 
is, it has a helical twist. Secondly, as a result of the twist, the adenines 
in the first and last positions point in opposite directions. Look, for 
example, at the NH2 groups on position 6 of the adenine rings of the first 
and last residues in the chain; the one at the bottom of the molecule is 
pointing backwards, and the one at the top is pointing forwards. The 
reason for this is that the orientation changes by 36" from one position to 
the next. So in going through five nucleotides (from 1 to 6) the total 
rotation is 180". The final important feature is that the bases are all 
stacked on top of one another. 
Trying to see all of these features emphasizes the limitations of two- 
dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects. For example, 
is the NH2 on the adenine ring at the bottom really pointing 
backwards, or is it pointing forwards? Are the bases really packed 
on top of one another? Stereo images are invaluable in answering 
such questions. 
The two structures in Figure 3.6 are not, in fact, identically positioned. 
Rather, one is rotated by a few degrees with respect to the other. This 
allows for a technique known as naked eye stereopsis, by which the 
structure to be seen in three dimensions. To do this, look at the page 
between the two models in Figure 3.6 and let your eyes go out of focus. 
You will see copies of the two images float towards one another. 
When they superimpose, the combined image will suddenly spring out

into three dimensions and the features described above will be obvious. It 
takes a little practice to get the effect first time, but after that it is easy. 
However, for those who cannot do this, stereo viewers are commercially 
available. 
3.1.4 The Complete Structure 
So far we have been looking at the components one chain of the double 
helix. We now need to put them together; that is to look at the base 
pairs that form between A and T, and between C and G, and how these fit 
into the double helical structure. Figure 3.7 shows a small region of a 
double helix that contains both an A/T base pair (bottom) and a G/C 
base pair. The hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines joining pairs of 
heavy atoms (oxygen/nitrogen or nitrogen/nitrogen). By convention, the 
hydrogen atoms themselves are not shown. There are three hydrogen 
bonds between guanine and cytosine, and two between adenine and 
thymine.

Finally, all of the structural elements that we have been considering are 
put together in the stereo diagram of the complete structure of the 
dodecamer in Figure 3.9. The chain starting with cytosine at top left runs 
5/43' downwards. The chain starting at bottom right runs 5I-3' 
upwards. It is instructive to trace as much of the sequences of the chains 
through the structure as possible.

3.2 Why a Double Helix? 
This question can be divided into two parts. Firstly, why does DNA form 
a double stranded structure? The answer to this can be arrived at by 
considering the physical properties of the nucleotides, and in particular 
their solubilities in water. Nucleotides are amphipathic molecules; that is 
they consist of two parts, one of which is hydrophilic (water loving) and 
the other hydrophobic (water hating). The sugar-phosphate part of the 
molecule is polar in nature, and interacts strongly with water. The partial 
charges on dipolar water molecules interact electrostatically with the 
oxygens of the deoxyribose and with the charge on the phosphate. The 
bases, one the other hand, although they contain substituents capable of 
hydrogen bonding to water, are essentially non-polar, and indeed the free 
bases are insoluble in water at neutral pH. 
The interior of a cell, which is the natural habitat of DNA, is an 
aqueous environment which is appropriate for the backbone but not for 
the bases. A solution to these opposing requirements is for the DNA to 
form a double chain with the sugar-phosphate part on the outside in 
contact with the surrounding water, and with the bases on the inside. This 
not only removes the bases from contact with the water but also allows 
them to form hydrogen bonds with one another, thus increasing the 
stability of the double stranded structure. In principle, they can also 
interact with each other by so-called hydrophobic bonding. 

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
63 
The second part of the question is why a helix'? It might be thought that 
one way in which DNA could form a double stranded structure which 
satisfies the requirement to put the bases inside and the backbone outside 
would be to produce a ladder with the base pairs as the rungs. Such a 
hypothetical ladder is shown diagrammatically in Figure 3.10 with the 
bases drawn edge-on simply as rectangular objects. 
Figure 3.10 A hypothetical 
ladder formed from anti-parallel 
polynucleotide chains. The rec- 
tangles represent bases viewed 
edge on. The red ovals show the 
space that would be occupied by 
water in such a structure. 
Adapted from Calladine and 
Drew'' 
From known bond lengths it can be calculated that the distance 
between adjacent bases in such a structure would be 0.6 nm. The 
thickness of the bases is, however, only about 0.33 nm. So such a 
structure would leave a hole of about 0.27 nm between the bases as 
indicated by the red ovals. We clearly cannot have a hole, and equally, 
because of the hydrophobic nature of the bases, the hole cannot be filled 
with water. This structure will not do. 
The question is how to fill up the hole. How this happens is shown in 
Figure 3.1 1. Here, the rectangular blocks are base pairs rather than 
individual bases, and the sugar-phosphate 
linkages are shown as 
dumbbells joined to the edges of the bases. In the left-hand diagram the 
base pairs are separated as in the DNA ladder shown in Figure 3.10. If 
the lower base pair is kept stationary, and the upper base pair is rotated 
anti-clockwise around a vertical axis through the centre, at the same 
time keeping the length of the dumbbells constant, then at some point 
the gap between them disappears. Given the dimensions shown in 
Figure 3.10, it can be calculated that a rotation of about 30" is required 
to close the gap. If such a rotation is repeated all along a ladder like that 
in Figure 3.10, after 13 base pairs we will have gone through 360°, and 
the last base pair will lie directly above the first. The ends of the 
dumbbells will have described a double helix just as we find in DNA. 
In fact, the calculations given here are not exact, and with the B-form of 
DNA the required angle of rotation is 36", so there are 10 base pairs 
in a complete turn of the helix and the eleventh base pair lies exactly 
above the first.

pairs by twisting. The rectangles

In summary, DNA forms a double helix for two reasons. Firstly, the 
double stranded structure forms to remove the bases from contact with 
water and to allow them to interact with each other. Secondly, the length 
of the sugar-phosphate unit compared with the width of the bases 
requires that the double chain twists into a helical shape to close up the 
gap between the base pairs. It is very satisfying to be able to reach a 
conclusion of fundamental importance on the basis of such simple 
chemical and geometric arguments.

3.3 The Stability of the Double Helix 
If solutions of double stranded DNA are heated, the chains separate and 
become random coils. This referred to as denaturation. It is easy to 
monitor denaturation of DNA by measuring changes in absorption of 
light at 260 nm, the wavelength at which the bases absorb maximally. On 
denaturation, the absorption of a solution of DNA increases by 20-30%; 
this is called the hyperchromic effect. The effect has its origin in the 
stacking of the bases in the double helical structure. The absorbance 
maximum at 260 nm originates from the n-electron system of the rings. 
When the bases are stacked, interaction between the n-electrons of the 
bases leads to a coupling of their transitions, and decreases the 
absorption. When the bases are un-stacked, this effect is removed. 
The type of denaturation curve obtained is shown in Figure 3.13. The 
temperature at which the increase in absorbance reaches 50% of its 
maximum is called the melting temperature ( Tm). For the two cases shown 
in Figure 3.13, the melting temperatures are about 78 "C and 89 O C.

Figure 3.13 Heat denaturation 
curves for two DNA samples with 
different base compositions 
The T, value depends on the nature of the solvent and is lower at lower 
ionic strength. If, however, the solvent conditions are kept constant, then 
the most important factor governing T, is the base composition of the 
DNA. The higher the content of G and C, the higher is the melting 
temperature. This is as expected, because the G/C base pair makes three 
hydrogen bonds, whereas the A/T pair makes only two. Indeed, there is 
an empirical quantitative relationship between the percentage G + C 
content and T, as shown in equation (3.1): 
%(G + C) = 2.44(Tm - K) 
(3.1) 
where K is a constant which depends on the solvent. Once it is known, 
equation (3.1) can be used to determine the %(G + C) for a newly isolated 
DNA molecule. 
In principle, if a solution of DNA which has been heated beyond Tm 
is returned to a lower temperature, the double helix can reform; this 
process is called renaturation or annealing. It is usually very rapid for 
small DNA molecules, but can be very slow for large ones. The reason for 

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
67 
this is that with large molecules there is considerable opportunity for 
improper base pairing to occur between regions of similar base sequence, 
and these incorrect base pairings must be broken before proper annealing 
can occur. The optimum conditions for renaturation are to keep the 
temperature just below the T,, so that incorrect base pairs can rapidly 
dissociate and allow the correct ones to reform. Under these conditions it 
is found that the time for renaturation depends on the complexity of the 
DNA sample. This is expressed quantitatively as the Cot value (more 
properly the Cot; value), which is the product of the initial concentration 
of denatured DNA expressed in terms the concentration of nucleotides 
(Co) and the time in seconds for 50% of the sample to renature (t;). This 
type of analysis is important, for example, in distinguishing the situation 
where a piece of DNA contains multiple copies of the same gene. Because 
of its lower complexity it will have a Cot value lower than that of a piece 
of DNA of similar size but without repetitive elements. 
We will return to the subject of melting and re-annealing DNA 
in Section 5.7, when we deal with a technique called the polymerase 
chain reaction. 
3.4 
Nucleosomes and Chromosomes 
DNA molecules are enormously long compared with the size of a typical 
cell (see Worked Problem 3.4) and so must be folded up in some way in 
order to fit in. In addition, long, thin DNA molecules would be very 
susceptible to mechanical breakage if they were not protected in some 
way. Indeed, it is very difficult to isolate intact DNA molecules from cells 
because they are so easily broken. For these reasons it is not surprising 
that DNA is found in cells packaged up with proteins into compact 
structures. This packaged DNA is called chromatin. 

_- 
68 
Nucleic Acids 
The basic unit of packaging is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes wcre 
discovered in 1973 by Hewish and Burgoyne.I6 What they did was to 
digest chromatin with an enzyme (dtoxyribonuclease) that hydrolyses 
DNA, and then to measure the sizes of the fragments that they obtained. 
The fragments were found to be 200 bp long, or a small multiple of that 
figure. Hewish and Burgoyne argued that this was because the DNA in 
chromatin is packaged in units of 200 bp, each of these units being 
associated with a protein complex. The deoxyribonuclease was able to 
hydrolyse the DNA in between these units, but the DNA in direct contact 
with the protein complex was protected from hydrolysis. Supporting 
evidence for this conclusion was obtained from studies on chromatin 
using electron microscopy. The chromatin had the appearance of a string 
of beads, the string being the DNA and the beads the protein complexes. 
These complexes of protein and DNA, or nucleosomes as they were 
called, are shown diagrammatically in Figure 3.14. 
Figure 3.14 
Nucleosomes. The DNA double helix is shown as a red ribbon. The cylindrical 
objects are complexes of two copies each of histones H2A, H26, H3 and H4. The red 
spheres are molecules of histone H1 
The protein components of the nucleosomes have been isolated and 
studied in detail. The core of the particle consists of two copies each of 
four proteins called histones. The four proteins in question are called 
histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. If these proteins are mixed in solution, 
then two copies of each combine to give a stable complex called the 
histone octamer. This is the structure represented by the cylinders in 
Figure 3.14. The DNA makes just less than two complete loops around 
the octamer spool. A complete loop contains eight turns of the double 
helix, and in total about 150 bp of the DNA is in contact with the protein 
spool. This leaves about 50 bp in the linking region between the octamers. 
This stretch of DNA can bind a ninth protein, called histone H1, shown 
in Figure 3.14 as a red sphere. Whether or not H 1 is bound in a particular 
preparation of nucleosomes depends on the solution conditions and in 
particular on the ionic strength. High salt concentrations cause the H 1 to 
dissociate. 
One further point needs to be made about the nucleosome. The usual 
picture that one has of DNA is as a straight rigid cylinder, but this view 
has to be modified when we consider the structure of the nucleosome. The 
DNA is wound around the protein spool and for every base pair in the 

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
69 
sequence on average the helix must bend by about 4.5" (there are 80 base 
pairs in a complete turn, and the angle passed through is 360"). The ease 
with which local areas of the double helix can distort from the ideal 
structure depends on the base sequences in those areas. Equally, then, 
different regions of DNA will bind to the octamer core with different 
affinities; the easier it is to bend the DNA, the tighter it will bind and 
vice versa. So, for example, runs of A/T or G/C pairs which render the 
DNA more rigid, weaken the binding. These effects are important 
because for the DNA to be transcribed into RNA it must detach 
temporarily from the protein core. This process will start at points 
where the binding is weakest. Consistently, the start points of genes often 
contain sequences that facilitate detachment from the nucleosome. 
Let us return to the problem posed at the beginning of this section, that 
is, how the DNA is packaged up into a compact structure that will fit into 
a cell. Formation of nucleosomes is part of the answer, but not all of it 
(see Problem 3.4). The poly-nucleosome fibre itself wraps up into a spiral 
with, on average, six nucleosomes per turn. This structure has a diameter 
of about 30 nm and is known as the 30 nm fibre. It is thought the histone 
HI plays a part in stabilizing its structure. There are, however, several 
other proteins associated with the 30 nm fibre which may play a part in its 
formation. The main ones belong to a group called the high-mobility 
group proteins (or HMG proteins). The name arises from the fact that the 
proteins migrate rapidly when subject to electrophoresis in an acidic 
buffer. They are present at relatively low levels (1-10% of the amount of 
histones) and their precise functions are still unclear. 
One turn of the 30 nm fibre has a length of about 11 nm. It contains 
approximately 1200 bp of DNA (six nucleosomes each with 200 bp), 
which in the B-form would have a length of a little over 400 nm. So the 
net reduction in length resulting from formation of nucleosomes and then 
packing them into 30 nm fibres is about 40-fold. 
There must be yet more compaction of the structure, but the details of 
this are still far from clear. What probably happens is that the 30 nm fibre 
forms loops with the ends anchored onto some sort of protein 
scaffolding, as shown schematically in Figure 3.15. It is thought that 
the loops contain an average of about 50 turns of the 30 nm fibre (the 
turns are represented by the little cells in Figure 3.15), so the length of 
each loop is about 250 nm or 0.25 pm. The total DNA in each loop is of 
the order of 60,000 bp, and the overall length of the DNA has been 
reduced by roughly 1000-fold. It is probably in this form that the DNA 
exists in the chromosomes of cells that are not dividing. The process by 
which the DNA in this form compacts by a factor of at least 10 again to 
form chromosomes that are clearly visible in the light microscope during 
cell division is unknown.

DNA Replication 
At the end of Section 3.1.1, a quotation was given from Watson and 
Crick's paper on the structure of DNA which indicated that they realized 
how their proposed structure could explain the mechanism of replication 
of the genetic information. Very shortly afterward, they published a 
second paper in which the theory was spelled out." The essence of it is 
that the strands of the double helix separate, and that each is used as a 
template for the synthesis of a new chain. This is shown schematically 
in Scheme 3.1. 
Scheme 3.1 
On the left is a small section of a double stranded DNA molecule 
(remember that DNA is helical, but it is unnecessary to show it as a 
helix for the present purposes). The chains separate, and on each of 
them a new complementary chain is synthesized. In the middle part 
of the scheme, the first eight bases have been copied and the new 
partial chains are shown in red. At the right of the scheme, copying 
is complete. What we now have is two molecules of DNA, both 
identical to the original molecule. Each contains one original chain, 
shown in black, and one new chain, shown in red. Because the new 
molecules contain one old and one new chain, this process is referred 
to as semi-conservative replication.

The chemistry of chain elongation is shown in Scheme 3.2. The 
incoming residue is added to the 3’-end of the growing polynucleotide. In 
Scheme 3.2, a G residue is to be added (that is, there would be a C at this 
position in the chain being copied). The residue is donated by 
deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP), and the reaction involves 
nucleophilic attack of the 3’-OH of the last residue in the chain on the 
a-phosphate of the dGTP, catalysed by the enzyme DNA polymerase. 
The result is formation of a new phosphodiester linkage and the 
liberation of pyrophosphate. It is important that the reaction goes to 
completion, and this is ensured by the presence of the enzyme 
pyrophosphatase which hydrolyses the pyrophosphate to two molecules 
of phosphate (Scheme 3.3) and in so doing pulls the equilibrium of 
Scheme 3.2 to the right.

A little thought will show that Scheme 3.2 cannot be the whole story. 
DNA polymerase catalyses the addition of a nucleotide onto the 3/-end 
of a growing chain. This is fine for duplication of the upper chain in 
Scheme 3.1; duplication starts at the 3/-end and goes 5/43‘ for the new 
chain as shown in Scheme 3.2. However, what about the other chain? It is 
shown being duplicated 3/+5/, and DNA polymerase cannot catalyse that 
reaction. The answer to this problem was provided by Reiji Okazaki and 
his colleagues.20 What they found was that, during replication, fragments 
of DNA about a thousand nucleotides long were also formed; these are 
now known as Okazaki fragments. It was proposed that one chain of 
DNA is synthesized continuously from 5’+3/ (this is called the leading 
strand), whereas the other (the lagging strand) is synthesized in fragments, 
again 5/+3/, and that these fragments are subsequently joined together to 
form a continuous chain. The process is summarized in Figure 3.18. 
Support for this mechanism for synthesis of the lagging strand came 
from the fact that an enzyme was already known that could join the two 
ends of a break in a DNA chain. The enzyme is called DNA ligase, and it 
catalyses the reaction shown in Scheme 3.4. First, the residue at the 5’-side 
of the break is converted to an adenylate in a reaction involving ATP; 
again, pyrophosphate is a product of this reaction and its hydrolysis pulls 
the reaction to the right. The full structure of the adenylate derivative is 
given in 4. The pyrophosphate linkage in this derivative is very reactive, 
and reacts readily with the 3/-OH group on the other side of the break to 
yield the desired product. This is another example of the way in which 
ATP participates in synthetic reactions (compare this with the situation 
where ATP acts as a phosphorylating agent as described in Box 2.5).

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
75 
This is by no means the end of the complexities of DNA replication. 
DNA polymerase is very efficient at adding residues to a growing chain - 
the enzyme from E. coli, for example, adds about 2000 bases per second 
under optimal conditions - but it cannot start a new chain from scratch. 
It requires a primer; that is, a small polynucleotide to get it going. How is 
this problem overcome? It turns out that DNA replication is initiated, not 
by DNA polymerase, but by a special DNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
called primase. This enzyme does not require a primer. It synthesizes a 
short stretch of complementary RNA (about five residues long) at the end 
of the DNA to be duplicated, after which DNA polymerase takes over 
and uses the short section of RNA as a primer to duplicate the rest of the 
DNA molecule. At some stage, the temporary piece of RNA is removed 
by a 5/+3‘ 
exonuclease and the missing residues are replaced by 
deoxyribonucleotides. This 5/+3‘ exonuclease activity is a second activity 
of the DNA polymerase. 
Why is this complication necessary? The reason is that DNA polymerase 
has a proofreading function. The specificity of DNA synthesis is determined 
in the first instance by the need for the incoming base to form the correct 
Watson-Crick base pair with the template strand. It can be estimated that, 
relying on this specificity alone, an error rate of about 1 incorrect base in 
10,000 would be expected. This is wholly inadequate for the accurate 
transmission of the genetic information. The error rate is decreased by the 
fact that the DNA polymerase has an active site that “senses” the shape of 
the forming base pair and rejects it if it is incorrect. This increases fidelity 
of copying by perhaps another one 1000-fold. Finally, if an incorrect 
residue has been incorporated, the DNA polymerase has a method of 
removing it again before synthesis proceeds. The way this works is that 
once a nucleotide has been added to the growing chain, the enzyme moves 
one base along the template chain and the newly formed base pair moves 
into a site which will only accommodate correct base pairs. If an incorrect 
base has been incorporated, the enzyme stalls, giving time for the 
incorrectly paired residue to dissociate from the template strand. When 
it does so, it encounters yet another catalytic site in the DNA polymerase 
that has 3’-exonuclease activity, and the residue is removed by hydrolysis. 
The correct base can now be added. This proofreading increases accuracy 
of replication by a further1000-fold and reduces the final error rate of 
replication to about 1 in 10” residues. Hence a crucial part of the function 
of DNA polymerase involves testing the preceding base pair for correctness 
before adding a new nucleotide. At the beginning of synthesis there is no 
preceding base pair and so the enzyme cannot function. RNA polymerase 
does not have this proofreading property, and can initiate synthesis 
without a primer. It does not matter if incorrect residues are incorporated 
by the RNA polymerase, because they are going to be removed anyway. 

76 
Nucleic Acids 
There is one aspect of DNA replication that we have yet to consider 
and which we will deal with only very briefly. As we know, DNA has a 
double helical structure. For replication, the helix has to be unwound. 
Again, there is an enzyme that does this job; the enzyme is called helicaue. 
The helicase binds to a region of the DNA referred to as the origin of 
replication and unwinds the helix in that region. Origins of replication are 
rich in A/T base pairs, and so are regions where the stability of the double 
helix is lower than average. The helicase then moves along the DNA 
molecule, in front of the DNA polymerase, unwinding it as it goes to 
create a replication fork (see Figure 3.18). To ensure that the DNA stays 
unwound long enough for the polymerase to do its job, single strand 
binding proteins attach themselves to the DNA strands and prevent them 
re-combining. The single strand binding proteins are displaced as the 
polymerase reaches them. Unwinding of the helix introduces another 
problem. This is that, as it is unwound, the remaining double helical part 
of the DNA becomes super-coiled (this is a bit like what happens to the 
cord on a telephone when the receiver is repeatedly picked up, turned 
around, and replaced). Again, there are enzymes, called topoisomerases, 
to deal with this difficulty. Topoisomerases catalyse a cut in one strand of 
the DNA, pass a section of the DNA through this break to relieve the 
super-coiling, and then join the two ends up again. A review of 
topoisomerases and how they work has been written by Wang.”

for the integrity of the genetic information. Changes brought about by 
these agents are called mutations, and chemical agents that lead to 
mutations are referred to as mutagens. Some mutagens lead to 
substitution of one base for another. An example is 5-bromouracil (5).

happens, then the consequence may be incorporation of G in the 
complementary strand in place of A. The way that this can happen is 
shown diagrammatically in Scheme 3.5. On the left of the scheme, a 
section of DNA is represented simply as a pair of lines with an A/T base 
pair shown. In step 1, the DNA is replicated and a 5-bromouracil 
(abbreviated as B) is incorporated into one strand in place of thymine; old 
strands are shown in black and new ones in red. In step 2, the 5- 
bromouracil directs incorporation of a guanine in the new strand. Finally, 
in step 3, correct base-pairing occurs and the G directs incorporation 
of a C in the new chain. The net result is a change from an A/T base pair 
to a G/C pair.

The reason why B base-pairs efficiently with G seems to be that the 
electronegativity of the bromine substituent favours formation of the mol 
tautonier of 5-bromouracil. This can form hydrogen bonds with guanine 
as shown in 6. 
Another effective mutagen is nitrous acid (HN02). The reason is that 
nitrous acid oxidatively deaminates NH2-containing bases, and converts 
them to the corresponding carbonyl derivatives. Adenine is converted 
to hypoxanthine, guanine to xanthine, and cytosine to uracil. Xanthine, 
like guanine, base pairs with cytosine so there is no effect as a result of 
this change. On the other hand, hypoxanthine pairs with cytosine, and 
this leads to a mutation from A/T to G/C (see Problem 3.6). 
A different type of mutation is frequently caused by polycyclic 
aromatic substances such as derivatives of acridine (7). These planar 
molecules can intercalate between the base pairs in the DNA double 
helix. An example is shown in Figure 3.20 (PDB entry 1G3X23). This 
shows a dodecamer of DNA with a derivative of acridine intercalated 
into it (the acridine has a tail of four arginine residues attached to it, 
but that is unimportant for the present purposes). The acridine ring, 
viewed edge-on, sits between a pair of adenines in one chain, and a 
pair of thymines in the other. Inserting the acridine ring obviously 
results in a considerable distortion of the backbones in its immediate 
vicinity .

79 
Figure 3.20 An acridine 
derivative intercalated into DNA 
The effect of intercalation of a molecule like acridine on DNA 
replication will often be the insertion of one, or even more, extra residues 
in the chain. In protein-coding genes this gives rise to frame shift 
mutations (see Section 1.6). If one or two extra bases are incorporated, 
then all of the codons after the point of insertion will be changed, with the 
likelihood that a stop codon will be met at some point, causing premature 
termination. If three bases are inserted, then this will result in insertion of 
an extra amino acid in the product protein, but the rest of the protein will 
be normal. This may or may not affect the activity of the protein product, 
depending on exactly where the extra amino acid is inserted. Other agents

that intercalate in this way include carcinogenic polycyclic compounds 
found in soot such as anthracenes and benzpyrenes, and a variety of 
naturally occurring toxins such as the liver carcinogen aflatoxin. 
Aflatoxin is produced by a mould that grows on peanuts. 
A different sort of damage to DNA is caused by ultraviolet radiation. 
The major effect of this is to cause dimerization of adjacent thymine 
residues to yield a cyclobutane product. This is shown in Scheme 3.6. 
The “squiggly bonds” shows the points of attachment of the thymines 
to the sugar-phosphate backbone. The result of this is to block the 
action of DNA polymerase, and so prevent replication of the DNA.

3.6.2 Repair 
It is not surprising, given the importance of the integrity of the genetic 
information, that Nature has developed ways of dealing with these 
various forms of damage to the DNA. To take the last-mentioned case 
first, just as UV light causes the problem, it also provides a solution. This 
is in the form of a light-dependent enzyme called DNA photalyase. This 
enzyme catalyses the reversal of the dimerization reaction, and reforms 
the two thymine residues. There is evidence that DNA photolyase is 
missing in some people suffering from the rare skin disease Xerodernza 
pigmentosa, which is characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight. The 
disease is inherited recessively (that is, defective genes must be inherited 
from both parents). Suffers usually develop skin cancers at sites exposed 
to the sun, and rarely survive beyond the age of 30. 
The most general method for correcting errors in DNA is excision 
repair. As the name implies, the incorrect or defective region of the DNA 
is cut out, and the damage is then repaired. One example of this process 
involves a second way of dealing with thymine dimers. A protein 
specialized for the task detects the distortion of the double helix caused by 
dimer formation. An endonuclease called evcinuclease then cuts the DNA 
strand containing the dimer at a point eight nucleotides away on the 
5’-side and four nucleotides away on the 3’-side. The liberated 12-mer 
dissociates from the rest of the molecule and the gap is filled in with the 
correct nucleotides. The enzyme responsible for doing this is DNA 

The Three-dimensional Structure of DNA and its Implications for Replication 
a1 
polymerase I. It uses the 3’-OH group at the gap as a primer. Finally, the 
newly inserted piece is joined to the 5’-end of the existing chain by DNA 
ligase. It is likely that deficiency in excinuclease is another cause of 
Xeroderma pigmentosa. 
Another type of excision repair involves removal and replacement of 
only a single residue, and usually operates where a base has been 
modified, for example by alkyation. What happens here is that the 
enzyme involved binds to the DNA at the damaged base and causes it to 
flip out of the helix. The enzyme then acts as a glycosidase and hydrolyses 
the bond between the base and C-1 of deoxyribose. The product is 
referred to as apurinic or apyrimidinic DNA (or AP DNA for short). 
There are many different glycosidases involved, each specific for a 
different type of modified base. The AP site is recognized by a specific 
endonuclease which cleaves the DNA chain adjacent to the AP site and 
the remaining deoxyribose phosphate is cut out. The gap is then filled by 
DNA polymerase I and the chain re-sealed by DNA ligase.

4.1 
The Three-dimensional Structure of RNA 
To understand some of the processes involved in RNA synthesis, it is 
necessary to know something of its three-dimensional structure. RNA is a 
single-stranded molecule, but nevertheless most RNAs are capable of 
forming double-helical structures over parts of their sequences. RNA 
does this by folding back on itself so that regions that have 
complementary, or nearly complementary, sequences can form duplex 
structures. The hydrogen bonding in these duplexes is mainly of the 
conventional type, that is A paired with U (remember that U replaces T in 
RNA) and G paired with C. Some unusual base pairing does, however, 
occur; for example, it is not uncommon to find G/U base pairs. 
The duplex regions, referred to as stems, are terminated by hairpin 
loops, usually with between three and six unpaired nucleotides. There may 
also be interior loops within a stem in which the bases do not hydrogen 
bond. and it is also common to find within a stem a single base that is not 
paired and forms a bulge. The whole structure is referred to as a stem-loop 
structure and a typical example is shown in Figure 4.1. 
85 

86 
Nucleic Acids 
Figure 4.1 Stem-loop struc- 
ture of a section of an RNA 
molecule 
The hydrogen bonds are shown simply as dashed lines, but recall that 
there will be two such bonds between A and U, and three between C and 
G. The complementary regions of such a stem-loop structure are double 
helical with helix parameters approximating to those of the A-form of 
DNA; that is, with 11 base pairs per turn of the helix (RNA cannot form a 
B-type double helix because there is not enough space for the hydroxyl 
group on C-2’). In general, RNA helices have irregular structures because 
of the presence of interior loops and bulges. 
Double-helical structures can also form between complementary DNA 
and RNA chains. The usual base pairing rules apply, but again the 
structure can contain irregular features such as bulges. An example is 
shown in the stereo model in Figure 4.2 (1 EFO’). Note that there is an 
adenine bulge in the RNA chain in this duplex (see Problem 4.1). DNA/ 
RNA hybrids play an important role in transcription, as we shall see in 
the next section.

Synthesis of Messenger RNA

~~~~~ 
A brief account of transcription, that is, the process by which the genetic 
message in DNA is converted into a message contained in the sequence of 
RNA, was given in Section 1.5. We must now look at the process in a bit 
more detail. The first point to note is that DNA is a double-stranded 
molecule, but the information constituting a particular gene is contained 
in only one strand, called the coding strand, read in the 5/+3/ direction. 
This is not the strand that is transcribed. RNA is synthesized taking its 
instructions from the complementary strand, or template strand as it is 
called. This is summarized in Scheme 4.1. 
Scheme 4.1 
The DNA coding strand is shown in red, and the template strand in 
black. In RNA synthesis the template strand is transcribed, the order 
of bases in the RNA being dictated by the normal Watson-Crick base 
pairing, except that adenine in DNA pairs with uracil (U) in RNA. 
The result of this is that the RNA transcript contains just the same message 
as does the coding strand on the DNA, except that U occurs in place of T. 
The chemistry of the chain elongation step in synthesis of RNA is 
essentially the same as that for the synthesis of the leading strand in DNA 
replication (Scheme 3.2). Synthesis is in the 5/43’ direction and the 
incoming nucleotide is donated by the appropriate nucleoside 5l-triphos- 
phate. This is summarized in Scheme 4.2. The last residue in the growing 
chain is a U, and the next one to be added is a G, specified by a C in 
the template strand of DNA. Again, pyrophosphate is liberated, and 
hydrolysis of this by pyrophosphatase drives the reaction to completion. 
Note that the 5’-residue of the transcript will retain its triphosphate group. 
The significance of this will be returned to below. 
Scheme 4.2 

88 
Nucleic Acids 
The reaction in Scheme 4.2 is catalysed by RNA polymerase. RNA 
polymerases are very complex enzymes. The enzyme from prokaryotes 
consists of five separate polypeptide chains, or subunits; there are two 
copies of a subunit called a, and one each of subunits called p, p’ and u. 
The corresponding enzyme from eukaryotes (called RNA polymerase 
11, or Pol 11) is even more complicated, and contains 12 protein 
subunits. However, both types of enzyme function in essentially the 
same way. 
Although RNA polymerase catalyses the same basic reaction as does 
DNA polymerase 111, there are some very significant differences. Firstly, 
RNA polymerase does not require a primer and can start new RNA 
chains from scratch; consequently, it does not have 5‘43‘ exonuclease 
activity (see Section 3.5). Secondly, it does not proofread the added 
nucleotide, and so it is not a 3’-exonuclease. It does, however, have other 
activities that are required to deal with very significant problems involved 
in RNA synthesis. 
Only a very small part of the DNA in a chromosome, the stretch 
corresponding to a single gene or a small group of genes (as found in 
operons; see Box 4.6), is transcribed into mRNA in any one transcription 
event. That is, RNA polymerase usually transcribes one gene at a time, 
and moreover it transcribes only those genes whose products are required 
by the cell at a particular moment. So the first problem is to search the 
DNA for a particular site, called the promoter site, which signals the 
beginning of the piece of DNA to be transcribed (see Box 4.1). In 
bacterial RNA polymerases this is the role of the u-subunit. The a2Pp’ 
enzyme, called the core enzyme, can catalyse elongation of an RNA chain, 
but it cannot find the right point to start. Instead, the a2pP’a enzyme 
binds to double-stranded DNA and slides along it until the a-factor 
recognizes a promoter site. Transcription then starts, and after the first 10 
or so residues have been incorporated, the a-factor dissociates and the 
core enzyme carries on transcribing the DNA chain; the a-factor is now 
available to bind to another core enzyme and assist it to find a different 
promoter site. 
Transcription cannot start until a segment of the DNA is unwound, 
because the enzyme uses base pairing with the template strand to 
specify the identity of the nucleotide to be inserted into the RNA 
molecule. At the start of transcription, a section of DNA that is 17 
base pairs long is unwound. This unwinding activity is an integral part 
of the function of RNA polymerase. The structure containing the 
polymerase and the unwound section of DNA is called the tranwription 
huhble. This structure now moves along the DNA double helix, 
unwinding it as it goes and winding back up that section that it has 
passed, at a rate of about 50 base pairs per second. As it goes the

89 
template strand of the DNA is transcribed. The RNA that is 
synthesized at first makes a DNA-RNA hybrid helix with the template 
strand, but after eight nucleotides have been incorporated, a region of 
the polymerase acts to pull the strands apart, thus liberating the 
growing RNA chain and freeing the transcribed region of the template 
strand to reform the DNA double helix. 
Finally, the RNA polymerase has to know where to stop. The 
most common termination signal consists of a G/C-rich stretch in the 
template strand, followed by a string of As. What does this do? 
Firstly, the RNA coded by the G/C rich region forms a stem-loop 
structure, as shown in Figure 4.3, by base pairing between the Cs 
and Gs. These are strong interactions, and disrupt the formation of 
the usual RNA/DNA hybrid. This causes the RNA polymerase to 
stall after it has incorporated a small number of extra nucleotides. 
Those extra nucleotides are a string of Us. The hydrogen bonding 
between A in DNA and U in RNA is weak, and this allows the 
RNA chain to dissociate from the DNA template, thus terminating 
transcription. 
Figure 4.3 Termination of tran- 
scription. The runs of G/C resi- 
dues form a stem-loop structure. 
This is followed by a string of Us 
(shown in red) which hydrogen 
bond only weakly to the DNA 
template; this leads to dis- 
sociation of the RNA from the 
template

In spite of the similarities in the process of mRNA synthesis in 
prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, there are also some profound differences. 
In prokaryotes, the mRNA is synthesized essentially in the form required 
for translation, and indeed translation usually starts before synthesis 
of mRNA is complete. In eukaryotes, very extensive processing is 
required before the mRNA is exported from the nucleus and protein 
synthesis can begin. 
The most immediate requirement for processing stems from the fact 
that most eukaryotic genes are not continuous stretches of DNA. Rather, 
the coding sequences, or exons, are interspersed with stretches of DNA 
that are not expressed in the final protein product; these are called introns. 
The general arrangement of the DNA in a eukaryotic gene is shown in 
Figure 4.4. The black regions of the gene are the sequences that will be 
expressed in the final protein product; the red regions are the intervening 
sequences, or introns, that will not be expressed. The initial RNA product 
of transcription contains both the exon and the intron sequences, and is 
referred to as pre-mRNA. 
Figure 4.4 
Arrangement of 
introns and exons in a eukaryotic 
gene 
The number of introns in different genes varies over a very wide 
range. For example, the genes for the a- and P-globin proteins that 
constitute the oxygen-transporting protein haemoglobin have only two 
introns. On the other hand, the gene for the protein dystrophin has 78 

92 
Nucleic Acids 
introns. Dystrophin is a very large protein and the coding regions of 
its gene contain about 11 kbp of DNA, but this is far outweighed by 
the amount of DNA in the introns, which amounts to 2.4 Mbp; this is 
the largest gene known. Generally, introns are smaller than those 
occurring in the dystrophin gene, and range from about 100 bp to 
1000 bp long. 
One aspect of the processing of pre-mRNA, then, is splicing, which is 
the cutting out of the introns and joining together of the exons to make a 
continuous message. Note that this has to be done with great accuracy 
~ if 
the splice is incorrect by one base, this will cause a frame-shift mutation 
(see Section 1.6), and the product protein after that splice site will have 
completely the wrong structure (or will be prematurely terminated). 
There must, then, be signals in the RNA which specify the beginning and 
the end of an intron. Most introns conform to the so-called GU-AG rule. 
This means that at the 5’-end of the intron there is an invariant GU 
sequence, and at the 3’-end there is an invariant AG sequence. These 
dinucleotide sequences will occur frequently in any RNA molecule, and 
so there must be other elements in the base sequence that specify the 
intron/exon junctions. Indeed, there are known consensus sequences for 
the residues following the GU and preceding the AG, but it is still a very 
difficult problem to predict in a pre-mRNA molecule where the spicing 
will occur (see Section 5.9).

intron. The exons are shown in 
black and the intron in red. The 
3’-end of exon 1 and the 5’-end of 
exon 2 are shown as N to denote 
any nucleotide. Phosphates link- 
ing the intron to the exons are 
shown as P. The OH at the branch 
site is the 2’-OH of an adenine 

Transcription and Translation of the Genetic Message 
93 
The mechanism of splicing is shown in Figure 4.5. An internal region of 
the intron, referred to as the branch site, contains an adenine residue, the 
2’-hydroxyl group of which carries out a nucleophilic attack on the 
phosphate linking the terminal residue of exon 1 to the 5’-G of the intron. 
The exon is liberated, and has a free OH at position 3‘ of the terminal 
residue. The 5’-terminal G of the intron is linked to the 2’-OH of the 
branch site adenine to from a cyclic structure (see Problem 4.3). The 
newly formed 3’-OH of exon 1 now attacks the link between the 3’-G of 
the intron and the 5’-phosphate of exon 2. This results in linkage of the 
two exons and liberation of the intron in a cyclic from known as a lariat 
(note that the spliced exons are drawn 3‘+5‘ 
in Figure 4.5). The key 
reactions in Figure 4.5 are transesterifications, and for clarity the process 
is shown in more detail in Scheme 4.3. 
Splicing is carried out by a structure called a spliceosome that consists 
of both proteins and several small RNA molecules. These complexes are 
called snRNPs (standing for small Euclear ribofiucleoprotein particles, 
and colloquially called snurps). Part of the role of the RNA components 
of the snurps is to recognize and bind to the conserved sequences at the 
splice points and at the branch site. Interactions between the components 
then bring the splice sites together for reaction to occur. The most 
remarkable thing about the splicing reactions, however, is that they are 
catalysed by the RNA components of the spliceosome rather than the 
proteins.

Transcription and Translation of the Genetic Message 
95 
Spicing out of introns is not the only modification that occurs to 
mRNA in eukaryotes. In fact, both ends of the niRNA are found to be 
modified. Modification at the 5’-end, a process called capping, occurs 
whilst the pre-mRNA is being synthesized. The first step is hydrolysis of 
the terminal phosphate of the nucleoside triphosphate at the 5’-end of the 
chain, followed by reaction with GTP to yield a very unusual 5/45‘ 
phosphotriester linkage (Scheme 4.4). 
Scheme 4.4 
The terminal guanosine is then methylated at N-7 to produce a 
structure known as cap 0. The first two ribose units in the original RNA 
chain may then be methylated on 0-2’ to yield cap 1 (if only the 5’-residue 
is methylated) or cap 2 (if both residues are methylated); these latter 
modifications do not, however, always occur. The modification at the 3’- 
end of the mRNA is more extensive. What happens is that a specific 
RNase recognizes a sequence AAUAAA at the 3’-end of the pre-mRNA 
transcript and hydrolyses the molecule at that point. Thereafter, an 
enzyme called poly-A polymerase adds a string of A residues to the 3’-end 
of the transcript to produce a poly-A tail. These tails can be anywhere 
from 20 to 200 residues long. The purpose of these modifications is not 
entirely clear. It is thought that the primary function of capping is to 
protect the newly synthesized pre-mRNA from hydrolysis by exonu- 
cleases. The poly-A tail probably also functions in this way, but there is 
also evidence that its presence is required for efficient translation of the 
genetic message. There is more on the subject of poly-A tails in Box 5.3.

Synthesis of Ribosomal and Transfer RNA 
In prokaryotes, the genes for rRNAs are organized in operons (see Box 
4.6 for further explanation of this term), each of which contains not only 
the genes for the 5S, 16s and 23s rRNA species, but also genes for one or 
more tRNA molecules. In E. coli, for example, there are seven such 
operons, the large number presumably a reflection of the fact that the 
organism has a need for a large number of ribosomes to provide for its 
rapid rate of protein synthesis. An example of the gene arrangement for 
one such operon from E. coli is shown in Figure 4.7. Transcription of 
these operons is done by the same enzyme that is responsible for synthesis 
of mRNA. Once the transcript is produced, it is processed by RNases to 
liberate the mature rRNA molecules. This is a complex process and we 
will not go into the details. 
Figure 4.7 Arrangement of 
rRNA and tRNA genes in an 
operon from E. coli. The regions 
coding for the final molecules are 
in red and regions which are 
removed are in black 
The situation is similar, but rather more complex, in eukaryotes. 
Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four rRNA species; that is, 5S, 5.8S, 18s 
and 28s. In most organisms, the genes for 5.8S, 18S, and 28s rRNAs are 
linked together in transcription units, and many of these units are found in 
clusters throughout the genome. For example, mammals have 100-300 of 
them. This, and the very high rate at which they are transcribed, is a 
reflection of the fact that 80% of the RNA in eukaryotic cells is rRNA. 
These genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), and again, the 
mature rRNAs are liberated from the transcripts by RNases. In most 
eukaryotes the 5s RNA molecules are coded by DNA not linked to that 
for the other rRNA species. These genes are also spread throughout the 
genome, but they are transcribed by a different enzyme (RNA polymerase 
111, or Pol 111). 
The transcripts of tRNA genes require processing at both the 5‘- and 
the 3’-ends to generate the mature tRNA molecules. A key enzyme in this 
processing, both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, is RNase P. RNase P is a 
ribozyme (see Box 4.2). The role of this enzyme is to generate the correct 
5’-terminus of the tRNA molecules. Processing at the 3’-terminus is more 
complicated. The reason is that all mature tRNA molecules must 
terminate in the sequence CCA (see Section 4.4) and, particularly in 
eukaryotes, this sequence is not usually encoded by the gene. Hence after 
initial trimming away of extra nucleotides, the terminal CCA sequence

has to be added by an enzyme called tRNA nucleotidyl transferase. The 
reaction catalysed by this enzyme is shown in Scheme 4.5, where N 
represents the 3’-residue of the pre-tRNA molecule. 
Scheme 4.5 L- 
~ 
Finally, many of the bases in tRNA molecules are chemically modified 
by enzyme systems that are not fully understood. We have already 
encountered two of the modified bases that occur (pseudouridine and 
dihydrouridine) in Worked Problem 2.3 and Problem 2.3. Particularly 
common is methylation to yield derivatives such as 7-methylguanosine, 
1-methyladenine and 5-methylcytidine. A different sort of modification 
also occurs when a base, frequently adenine, is replaced by inosine. In 
addition, methylation may occur at the 2’-OH groups of some of the 
ribose residues (see Figure 4.1 1 for details of the modified bases and 
nucleosides that occur in one particular tRNA molecule). 
4.4 
Translation of Messenger RNA 
4.4.1 The Role of Transfer RNA 
The bare outlines of how mRNA is translated into protein have already 
been covered in Section 1.7. To recap, the mRNA is read from the 
5’-end three bases at a time, each triplet of bases coding for insertion of 
an amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. The protein chain is 
synthesized from the N-terminal end. At some point, a termination codon 
is reached, and translation stops. We now need to look at how these 
processes happen. 

Transcription and Translation of the Genetic Message 
99 
The first problem that came into focus after the nature of the 
genetic code was established was how a code written in terms of a 
sequence of nucleotides could be used to specify the order of a set of 
very different molecules, the amino acids, in a protein chain. It did 
not seem likely that the amino acids could interact directly with the 
codons in the mRNA. The solution to the problem was provided by 
Francis Crick, who came up with the brilliant idea that adaptors 
were required to do the job. The suggestion was that an amino acid 
would be linked with a specific adaptor, and that the adaptor 
would then recognize the codon for its amino acid in the mRNA. 
It seemed reasonable to suppose that the adaptors would have, as part 
of their structures, a triplet of nucleotides that would recognize the 
codon using conventional Watson-Crick base pairing. The adaptor 
hypothesis turned out to be essentially correct, and the adaptors were 
identified as group of small RNA molecules called transfer RNA 
or tRNA. 
Within a relatively short time of the formulation of the adaptor 
hypothesis, the nucleotide sequence of a tRNA molecule, the alanyl- 
tRNA from yeast, was determined by Robert Holley and his co- 
workers* (alanyl-tRNA is the particular tRNA that is specific for 
alanine). This was a remarkable achievement. Not only was it the first 
nucleic acid to be completely sequenced, it was also found to contain 
a large number of modified bases, the structures of which had to be 
determined. The molecule contains a total of 76 nucleotides. Not only 
did Holley and his team determine the nucleotide sequence, they 
also proposed that the molecule was folded into what is known as a 
clover leaf structure by base pairing between complementary regions 
of the polynucleotide chain. This proposal has now been shown to be 
correct. 
The structures of many tRNA molecules are now known, and they all 
have some features in common, as shown in the cartoon in Figure 4.8. 
The 3/-end of the molecule always has the sequence CCA, and the 
terminal adenine is not phosphorylated. The 5’-residue, most often a G, is 
phosphorylated on the 5/-OH. There are four regions where the chain 
runs antiparallel to itself and forms hydrogen bonds between com- 
plementary sequences (hydrogen bonds are shown as single lines between 
the cells in Figure 4.8); the molecule in these regions is double helical. 
Three of these hydrogen-bonded stems end in loops. The DHU loop is so 
called because it usually contains one or two residues of dihydrouracil. 
The TYC loop always contains that triplet of bases at the 5’-end of the 
loop (recall that thymine does not normally occur in RNA). Finally, the 
anticodon loop contains the three bases that constitute the anticodon. 
In addition to these, there is an extra loop which is of variable size,

and accounts largely for the differences in length from one tRNA 
molecule to another.

Confirmation of the correctness of the clover leaf structure came when 
the structure of a t-RNA molecule was determined by single-crystal X-ray 
diffraction. The particular t-RNA concerned was the phenylalanyl- 
tRNA from yeast. Its backbone structure, taken from 6TNA,9 is shown 
in Figure 4.9. The molecule is L-shaped, with the point of attachment of 
the amino acid at the top right, and the anticodon triplet of bases at the 
bottom. The positions of the loops and the stems are marked so that 
comparison can be made with the cartoon in Figure 4.8. The same 
t-RNA in the same orientation is shown in Figure 4.10, this time as a 
wireframe model, with the anticodon triplet and the 3’-terminal CCA 
coloured red. Figure 4.11 gives the nucleotide sequence of this t-RNA 
molecule. Note the large number of modified bases and nucleosides that 
it contains. Wybutosine is a very highly modified guanine with the 
structure shown in 1. It is frequently found near the anticodon in t-RNA 
(see Problem 4.6).

There are two essential properties that the t-RNA molecule must 
have: it must accept the correct amino acid, and it must recognize 
the appropriate codon in the mRNA. To take the second of these 
first, recognition of the codon is by base paring, with the codon read 
in the S-3’ 
direction and the anticodon in the 3/+5/ direction. The 
anticodon of phenylalanyl-tRNA is 3/-AAG-5/ (in fact, the G is 2’- 
0-methylguanosine, but this base pairs in the same way as G), so 
what codon will it recognize? This will be 5/-UUC-3/. Table 1.3 
shows that this is indeed one of the two codons for phenylalanine. 
Table 1.3 also shows that there is a second codon for phenylalanine, 
namely UUU. Does this mean that a second t-RNA must exist with 
the anticodon sequence AAA? It turns out that this is not the case. 
The same t-RNA can read both of these codons. This is possible 
because there is some latitude in the base pairing between the 3’-base 
of the codon and the 5’-base of the anticodon. This possibility was 
put forward by Crick in what is known as the wobble hypothesis.l0 
A list of the allowed pairings is shown in Table 4.1. Note that 
inosine can base pair in the wobble position with three other bases 
(U, C and A) and consequently it is very frequently found in 
anticodons so as to maximize the number of codons that can be 
read. For example, the alanyl-tRNA from yeast has the antico- 
don sequence 3’-CGT-5’, and it can recognize the codons GCA, GCC 
and GCU. 
The base pairs that I niakes with A, U and C are shown in 2-4, 
respectively. It can be seen that the geometry is nearly the same in all 
cases, and the small deviations from the accurate geometry of 
Watson-Crick base pairs can be accommodated by small movements 
of the polynucleotide backbone of the t-RNA. The reason why 
wobble is restricted to the 5’-base of the anticodon seems to be that 
the 3/-base is always followed by a G, usually heavily modified 
(wybutosine in the phenylalanyl-tRNA), which forms strong stacking 
interactions with the preceding two bases and anchors them in a 
configuration that accepts only standard Watson-Crick 
base pairs 
(see Problem 4.6). 


104 
Nucleic Acids 
It is essential that the correct amino acid is linked to the tRNA, because 
once the tRNA is charged with an amino acid it will deliver it to the 
growing protein chain as specified by the codon in the mRNA. If the 
tRNA is incorrectly charged, then it will incorporate the wrong amino 
acid. This was shown in a classic experiment where cysteinyl-tRNA 
was charged with the correct amino acid, which was then converted to 
alanine by treatment with Raney nickel. This wrongly charged tRN A 
was found to incorporate alanine into proteins in response to the codon 
for cysteine. 
Hence the correct translation of the genetic code depends as much on 
the fidelity of charging the tRNA molecules as it does on the recognition 
of the codon by the anticodon. The error frequency of incorporation of 
the amino acid seems to be between 1 in lo4 and 1 in 10’. This is 
achieved partly by the specificity of the interactions between the enzyme 
and its cognate t-RNA, but most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases also 
have a proofreading function. Once the amino acid has been linked to 
the 3‘-A of the t-RNA, it visits a second catalytic site on the enzyme, 
where, if the attached amino acid is incorrect, the bond to the t-RNA is 
hydrolysed. For example, if threonyl-tRNA synthetase is incubated with 
its cognate t-RNA that has been artificially charged with serine, the 
serine is rapidly removed. This is an error that is likely to occur in 
practice because serine and threonine are chemically similar amino acids 
(see Table 1.2). The editing site seems to work on the basis that the 
smaller amino acid (serine) can enter the site where hydrolysis occurs, 
whereas the correct amino acid, threonine, cannot enter the editing site 
and so is not hydrolysed. 
4.4.2 Protein Synthesis 
We turn now to the events of protein synthesis, concentrating on 
mainly as they occur in prokaryotes. The key role here is played by the 
ribosome, the outline structure of which has already been described in 
Section 1.7. At the start of protein synthesis, the ribosome exits as 
separate subunits (30s and 50s particles in the case of prokaryotes). 
The process begins by binding of the mRNA to the 16s rRNA molecule 
in a small ribosomal subunit. This binding involves base pairing 
between the 16s rRNA and a region centred about 10 nucleotides 
upstream (on the 5’-side) of the initiator AUG codon. This upstream 
region is rich in purines and is referred to as the Shine-Delgarno box. 
A typical sequence is shown in 5, where the first group of red nucleo- 
tides is the Shine-Delgarno sequence, and the initiator codon (AUG) is 
also in red. 

Transcription and Translation of the Genetic Message 
105 
At this point, a special tRNA, called initiator tRNA, binds to the 
AUG codon at the start of the message. This tRNA is charged with 
methionine which has been modified by formylation of the a-amino 
group. The situation is now as illustrated schematically in the left-hand 
part of Figure 4.12, where the black oval represents the small ribosomal 
subunit, the black line is the mRNA and the red rectangle is tRNAf 
charged with N-formylmethionine. This complex then recruits a large 
subunit as shown in the central part of Figure 4.12 (open oval) to produce 
the complete translation complex. The initiator tRNA is bound at a site in 
the complex called the P-site (P stands for peptide).

protein synthesis. The black oval 
represents thesmall ribosomal sub- 
unit and the black 
the mRNA, 
Red rectangles represent tRNA 
Protein synthesis now proceeds. The charged tRNA specified by the 
next codon in the mRNA is recruited to the ribosome, and binds at what 
is called the A-site (A stands for aminoacyl). This is shown in the right- 
hand part of Figure 4.12; the codon in this example is CGA, which 
specifies insertion of an arginine. The amino group of the amino acid 
linked to this tRNA is positioned adjacent to the ester linkage between 
N-formylmethionine and its tRNA. A peptidyl transferase in the ribosome 
then promotes transfer of the N-formylmethionine residue to this amino 
group, with formation of a peptide bond. The reaction is given in Scheme 
4.7, where the tRNA molecules are shown schematically in red. It is 
interesting to note that the peptidyl transferase activity is a property of 
the 23s rRNA and does not involve any of the protein components of the 
ribosome; that is, the peptidyl transferase is a ribozyme.

Scheme 4.7 

106 
Nucleic Acids 
At this stage, the growing protein chain is attached to the tRNA 
molecule in the A-site and the initiator tRNAf in the P-site is uncharged. 
Both are still hydrogen bonded to the mRNA. The next event is 
movement of the mRNA through the ribosome by one codon in the 
direction right to left. This is promoted by an enzyme called elongation 
factor G. The result is shown in the left-hand part of Figure 4.13. The 
initiator tRNAf is detached from the mRNA and occupies a third site on 
the ribosome called the E-site (E stands for exit). The tRNA carrying the 
growing protein chain occupies the P-site, and the A-site is empty ready to 
receive the next charged tRNA. Next the initiator tRNAf exits from the 
ribosome, and the tRNA coded by the third codon (shown as alanyl- 
tRNA in Figure 4.13) enters the A-site. Peptide bond formation ensues 
(right-hand part of Figure 4.13), and the whole process repeats itself to 
extend the protein chain further.

Termination of translation occurs when one of the three possible 
stop codons is reached. There are no tRNA molecules with anticodons 
complementary to these codons. Rather they are recognized by proteins 
called release Factors (RFs). There are two of these. One, RFl, 
recognizes the codons UAA and UAG. The other, RF2, recognizes 
UAA and UGA. They appear to work by coordinating a water 
molecule which is transported to the peptidyl transferase centre of the 
ribosome, where it leads to hydrolysis of the ester linkage between 
the C-terminal amino acid and the tRNA to which it is attached. 
The protein then leaves the ribosome. Finally, a protein factor called 
ribosome release factor causes the ribosomal subunits to separate and 
the mRNA to be released. 

Transcription and Translation of the Genetic Message 
109 
It should be noted that soon after protein synthesis has started, the 
region of the mRNA containing the Shine-Delgarno sequence emerges 
from the ribosome. Once that has happened, another small ribosomal 
subunit can bind to it and create a new translation complex. Hence, 
particularly under conditions of rapid protein synthesis, several 
ribosomes can be found translating the same mRNA. A mRNA with 
several ribosomes attached and actively synthesising protein is called a 
polysome. 
Translation in eukaryotes is somewhat more complex than in 
prokaryotes, but the broad outlines are similar. One difference is that 
eukaryotes do not have an equivalent to the Shine-Delgarno sequence. 
Rather, the small ribosomal subunit binds to the 5’-cap region of the 
mRNA, and then works its way along until it reaches the first AUG 
triplet. This is then taken as the start signal for translation. This difference 
compared with prokaryotes reflects the Fdct that many prokaryotic 
mRNAs contain more than one message (that is, they are polycistronic) 

110 
Nucleic Acids 
~~

~ 
and so must be able to bind ribosomes at several sites (see Box 4.6). 
Another difference is that eukaryotic translation starts with methionine 
rather than N-formylmethionine, although, as with prokaryotes, a special 
tRNA is used to recognize the initiation codon, and a different methionyl- 
tRNA recognizes internal methionine codons. The chemical events in 
chain elongation are essentially the same as in prokaryotes. There are 
differences in the protein factors involved in the various phases of 
translation, but these need not concern us.

Modern Tools of DNA

5.1 
Introduction: Recent Advances in 
DNA Technology 
The story of DNA for the first 100 years was one of slow increases in 
understanding of its biological role and of its chemical structure. This 
culminated in the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA, and 
consequent elucidation of the way in which the genetic information is 
replicated and expressed. The rate of development in the subsequent years 
has been dramatic, not only in the amount of information that we have 
about DNA sequences, but also in the ways in which that knowledge has 
been applied to the benefit of humankind. 
For example, it is now possible to gcticticall! etiginccr bacteria so that 
they are able to produce human proteins (see Section 5.6). This has 
enormous importance for the production of therapeutic agents, To give 
116

one example, human growth hormone is a protein of 217 amino acids 
which is produced by the pituitary gland. Underproduction of the 
hormone in children leads to dwarfism arising from failure of the long 
bones to develop normally. The condition can be treated by injection of 
growth hormone, but it is very difficult to obtain human pituitary glands 
from which to isolate the protein, so the number of children that could be 
treated in the past was very small. Now, however, the gene coding for 
human growth hormone has been inserted into bacterial cells (or cloned 
into those cells, to use the modern terminology). These cells can be grown 
in culture, and provide a virtually limitless source of growth hormone. 
Many therapeutic agents are now produced by this route. 
Genetic engineering is not restricted to micro-organisms. More recently, 
there have been great advances in the ability to genetically modify plants. 
The objectives of this include increasing productivity of crop plants, 
introduction of pest resistance thus reducing the need for artificial pesti- 
cides, developing crop plants that will grow in hostile environments, and 
modifying plants to compensate for nutritional deficiencies. For example, 
about 1 million children in the third world die every year, and 5 million 
become blind, because of lack of vitamin A in their diet. This arises from 
the fact that their staple food is rice, which lacks vitamin A. A strain of rice 
has now been engineered that synthesizes vitamin A (and also has 
increased iron content), the use of which will help to solve these problems. 
In a different area, DNA fingerprinting (see Box 5.10) is now a widely 
used technique in forensic science. The method has been developed to the 
point where the DNA from the follicle of a single hair from a crime scene 
can be used to unambiguously identify the perpetrator of a murder or a 
rape. Equally important, DNA fingerprints obtained from archived 
scene-of-crime material have now been used to put right several cases of 
miscarriage of justice where the wrong person had been convicted. 
Most recently, the DNA sequences of complete genomes have been 
determined. These include the genomes of many bacteria, some of them 
pathogens that are responsible for human disease. Knowledge of their 
genome structures will lead to advances in ways of combating infection. 
Similarly, the genome sequence of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium 
,falc@avum, has recently been completed, as has that of its primary 
mosquito host, Anopheles gambiae. Malaria kills over 1 million people 
every year, the majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 
500 million people suffer from the disease. The hope is that knowledge of 
the genome sequences will provide pointers towards preventative 
strategies. Already, for example, a genetically modified form of the 
related mosquito A. stephensi, whose parasite P. berghei causes malaria in 
mice, has been constructed. The modified mosquito is unable to transmit 
the parasite. Perhaps it will prove possible to do the same thing with 

118 
Nucleic Acids 
A .  gambiae and produce a mutant which, if released into the wild, would 
supplant the wild-type population. However, it is early days yet. 
Perhaps most public interest focuses on the structure of the human 
genome, a “first draft” of which was published in 2001. This has already 
provided a wealth of information, and much more will come in the future 
as the structure of the genome is examined in detail. A very large amount 
of work is now being done on mapping differences between the genomic 
DNA of different individuals. Most of these differences are single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (or SNPs, pronounced snips); that is, differ- 
ences in single residues in particular positions. It is estimated that there 
are about 10 million SNPs in the human genome, and it is largely from 
these that individual differences in characteristics such as susceptibility to 
diseases arise. The prospect is that one day it will be possible to predict 
from an individual’s DNA profile which diseases he or she is likely to get 
in the future, and to take preventative action to avoid them. 
One exciting area that has already developed very considerably from 
comparison of the patterns of differences in the genomes of human 
populations is the study of the history of mankind’s evolution. It is now 
clear that all existing human populations are descended from a small 
group of people who lived in Africa a little more than 100,000 years ago, 
and it is possible to trace the migration of their descendants out of Africa 
to their present locations. We cannot go into the details of this fascinating 
story, but if you are interested in your evolutionary history, then you 
cannot do better than read the account given by Steve Olson.’

119 
By any standards, this (very partial) list of advances in DNA 
technology over the last few decades is remarkable, and the question 
arises as to how so much has been done in a relatively short time. The 
answer lies essentially in the development of new experimental tools. It 
is a general phenomenon that rapid advances in scientific knowledge 
are made as a result of discovery of new experimental techniques. 
A description of what those tools are in the case of DNA studies, and 
how they are used, is the focus of this chapter. 
5.2 
Gel Electrophoresis 
Gel electrophoresis is a key technique for both the purification and the 
analysis of DNA samples. The term electrophoresis is used to describe 

120 
Nucleic Acids 
~ 
the movement of charged molecules in an electric field. In practice, the 
molecules are made to move through the liquid phase of a gel which, 
depending on the particular application, may be made of agarose or of 
polyacrylarnide. Agarose is a polysaccharide obtained from seaweed; the 
structure of the monomeric unit is shown in 1. If agarose is dissolved in 
hot water and then allowed to cool, the polysaccharide chains interact to 
form a gel, the pore size of which depends on the concentration of agarose 
used. Acrylamide has the structure shown in 2 (the proper name of this 
coinpound is propenamide, but you would search in vain in the index of 
any textbook of biochemistry or molecular biology for a reference to 
that name or to polypropenamide, and so we will not use them here). 
It undergoes free-radical polymerization to form a linear polymer, but 
the resulting material lacks mechanical strength. If, on the other hand, 
some N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (3) is included in the reaction, then 
the polyacrylamide chains are cross linked as shown in Scheme 5.1. 
The degree of cross linking, and hence the pore size of the gel, depends on 
the percentage of the bisacrylamide included in the reaction mixture.

In both cases, the gel is made in a buffer solution at neutral or alkaline 
pH, under which conditions nucleic acids carry a net negative charge. 
The gel is cast between rectangular plates and small wells are cut to 
receive the samples. An electric field is then applied, with the negative 
pole at the top and the positive pole at the bottom. The individual 
components of the mixture of nucleic acids will move down the gel at 
rates dependent on their sizes. The smaller the molecule, the fater it 
moves; this is essentially because small molecules can move more easily

5.3 Restriction Enzymes 
~ 
~ 
~~~ 
In the previous section, we considered the use of gel electrophoresis to 
separate DNA fragments without saying where those fragments come 
from. The answer is by digestion of larger DNA molecules using 
restriction enzymes. The restriction enzymes are endonucleases which cut 
DNA chains at highly specific sequences, and their discovery marked a 
major leap forward in DNA chemistry because they provide a tool for 
producing defined pieces of DNA. They have been colourfully referred to 
as “molecular scissors’’ because they allow the DNA to be cut according 
to the pattern provided by the sequence of the molecule. 
The restriction enzymes were discovered in the late 1960s by scientists 
who were interested in a process called host-controlled restriction. What 
this means is that when phage propagated on one strain of bacteria are 
transferred to a different strain, the ability of the phage to infect the new 
strain is often severely restricted. The phenomenon was studied by groups 
lead by Werner Arber, Daniel Nathans and Hamilton Smith, and it was 
shown that restriction occurs because the bacteria produce enzymes 
(restriction enzymes) that degrade the phage DNA and so prevent it from 
being replicated. The DNA of the host bacterium is not degraded because 
some of the bases in the site recognized by the restriction enzyme are 
methylated and this prevents the activity of the enzyme. A few copies of 
the phage DNA also become methylated and so escape digestion. These 
can lead to the production of new phage, which is why the infection is 
only restricted rather than prevented. 
There are in fact three different types of restriction enzyme that work 
in somewhat different ways, but only one type, the Type 11 enzymes, are 
used in DNA studies and we will concern ourselves only with those. 
The first such enzyme was isolated by Smith and Wilcox,2 but now many 
different ones are known. Typical, and very widely used, is the enzyme 
EcoRI, so called because it was isolated from E. coli and was the first 
such enzyme isolated from that source. The recognition sequence of the 
enzyme is 5’-GAATTC-3’ and the way in which it acts is shown in 
Scheme 5.3. The essential feature of its action is that it cuts both chains, 
but not at points opposite one another. Rather, it cuts between residues 
1 and 2 in the 5’+3’ 
chain, and residues 5 and 6 in the 3’+5’ chain. 
This produces two chains, each with four unpaired residues. These 
sections of single-stranded DNA are known as sticky ends for reasons 
that will become apparent in Section 5.5. The recognition sequence of 
EcoRl has the special feature that it is palindromic; that is the sequences 
of the two chains read 5’+3‘ 
are the same. Put another way, the 
recognition site has two-fold symmetry. This is a feature of nearly all 
Type I1 enzymes, and is related to the way that the site is recognized by 
the restriction enzyme.

“Sticky ends” 
Not all restriction enzymes produce sticky ends, and not all of them 
have a six-base recognition site. For example, Ah1 recognizes the 
sequence 5’-AGCT-3’ and cuts in the middle of the sequence as shown in 
Scheme 5.4. In this case the product fragments have blunt ends. The 
enzyme NotI, on the other hand, has an eight-base recognition site and 
produces sticky ends. Some of the most commonly used restriction 
enzymes are listed in Table 5.1.

The enormous importance of the restriction enzymes is that they are 
completely specific and so can be used to cut large DNA molecules in a 
very precise way into pieces that are useful for other applications such as 
cloning (see Section 5.6) and sequencing (see Section 5.8). 
An example of their use might be helpful. Consider the results reported 
in Figure 5.1. How were the pieces of DNA of defined lengths in track A

obtained? The answer is that they were produced by the combined action 
of two restriction enzymes, BamHT and Bglr, on a plasmid called pBR322. 
The plasmid is a circular DNA molecule 4361 bp in length, and a 
diagram showing some of its features is given in Figure 5.3. The 
numbering of the bases is done by reference to the unique EcoRI site; 
base number 1 is taken as the first T in this recognition site. A description 
of the plasmid, and a list of all the restriction sites that it con- 
t ains, are available at h t t p: // www . fermen t as. corn/ techinfo/NucleicAcids/ 
mappbr322.htm. 
The positions of the recognition sites for BanzHT and Bgfl are as 
shown. The latter enzyme has the recognition site 5’-GCCNNNNI 
NGGC-3’ where, as usual, N signifies any nucleotide. The numbers given 
for the restriction sites in Figure 5.3 are those for the first base in the site. 
Hence cleavage at the BawlHI site occurs after base 375 and at the 
first BglI site at base 935 (if you find this confusing, reference to 
Figure 5.22 which gives the complete sequence of pBR322, with the 
restriction sites in red, should help). The restriction fragment produced is 
therefore 560 bp long, as shown in Figure 5.1. You can check that 
the lengths given for the other fragments are correct. 
5.4 
Blotting and Hybridization 
Suppose that we want to isolate a particular DNA fragment from a 
restriction enzyme digest, and further suppose that we know at least a 
little of its base sequence. How do we proceed? We can separate the 
fragments by gel electrophoresis, but the problem is how to identify 
the piece of DNA that we want. The answer to this is provided 
by hybridization. A small piece of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), or 
oligonucleotide, can be synthesized (how this is done is described in 
Section 5.10) that is complementary to a section in one of the chains of the 
DNA molecule we wish to find in the gel. Because the synthetic 
oligonucleotide has a sequence complementary to that of a section of the 
target DNA, it will bind to it and form a hybrid molecule. 
The problem is that it is not possible to do this directly, because the gels 
used for electrophoresis are not sufficiently stable mechanically to allow 
the required manipulations to be carried out. The solution to this problem 
was developed by Edward Southern in 1975.4 The technique essentially 
involves blotting of the DNA fragments from the gel onto a mechanically 
and chemically stable membrane made of nylon or nitrocellulose. In 
recognition of its inventor the method is known as Southern blotting (or 
sometimes as Southern transfer). It is carried out as shown in Figure 5.4. 
The gel is placed on a paper wick dipping into a reservoir of alkaline 
buffer, and overlaid with the membrane. On top of the membrane is 

126 
Nucleic Acids 
placed a stack of paper towels pressed down by a weight. The buffer is 
sucked up through the paper towels by capillary action, and carries the 
DNA molecules onto the membrane. After transfer, the membrane is 
heated to fix the DNA molecules in place and to promote their 
dissociation into single strands. The pattern of DNA molecules on the 
membrane will be a replica of the pattern in the gel, and the molecule of 
interest can be located by probing with the synthetic oligonucleotide. 
Once it is located, the appropriate band can be eluted from a duplicate 
gel and will lead to a purified sample of the DNA molecule required. 
How long should the oligonucleotide be so as to ensure that it is specific 
for the DNA of interest? If it is too small, then it is quite likely that the 
sequence will occur by chance in some other DNA molecule. In addition, 
to be sure that the probe binds only to the piece of DNA to which 
it is completely complementary, we need to use stringent hybridization 
conditions; in practice, this means carrying out the hybridization at 
temperature just below the T, for the duplex formed between the probe 
and the target DNA. Larger probes allow more stringent conditions to be 
used so that duplexes with one or two mismatched bases are not allowed 
to form. There is no firm rule about the optimum size, but oligonucleo- 
tides in the range of 15 to 20 residues long are routinely used. The 
temperature required for the hybridization step can be worked out using 
equation (5. l), which relates T, to the number of residues of each base in 
the oligonucleotide: 
Tm = (4[G + C] + 2[A +TI) "C 
(5.1) 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
127 
It is necessary, of course, to be able to detect the position of the 
hybridized oligonucleotide on the membrane. One way of doing this is to 
incorporate a radiolabelled residue into the oligonucleotide and then to 
carry out autoradiography (see Box 5.2). Because of the dangers involved 
in using radioisotopes, this method is decreasing in popularity. A very 
good alternative is to couple biotin to the probe. Biotin has the structure 
shown in 5. The value of doing this is that biotin binds extremely strongly 
and specifically to a protein molecule called avidin. After the blotting 
procedure has been carried out, the membrane is treated with the biotin- Hv

Making Recombinant DNA Molecules 
~~ 
~~~ 
For many purposes, some of which will be described in the next 
section, it is necessary to join DNA molecules together. This process is 
referred to as ligation, and the product is a recombinant DNA molecule. 
Key to this process is the enzyme DNA ligase, an enzyme which 
has already been described in Section 3.5 in the context of DNA 
replication. The essential property of the enzyme is that it can form 
the phosphodiester bond between two adjacent nucleotides in a DNA 
chain. The question is how to bring the ends of the DNA molecules 
that we wish to join together adjacent to one another. The answer is 
provided by the sticky ends that are produced by some restriction 
enzymes. 
Suppose, for example, that the two pieces of DNA that we wish to join 
have been produced by fragmentation using HindIIT (see Table 5.1). In 
this case the situation will be as shown in Scheme 5.5, where the line 
joining the nucleotides represents the phosphodiester linkage. 
Scheme 5.5 
One DNA molecule (DNA1 in Scheme 5.5) will have a sticky overhang 
with the sequence TCGA at its 3’-end (shown in red). The second DNA 
molecule will have an overhang with the sequence AGCT at its 5’-end. 
These, of course, are complementary and will hybridize (hence the name 
“sticky end”). At this stage, the phosphodiester linkage between the A 
residues is missing and the fragments are held together only by base 
pairing. If DNA ligase is added, however, the linkages are formed and the 
two original molecules are now covalently linked into a single recom- 
binant molecule. 
Making recombinant molecules from fragments with blunt ends is 
more difficult. Although DNA ligase can catalyse the necessary reactions 
to join blunt ended molecules, the process is very inefficient. The reason is 
that the concentration of DNA fragments will be very low, and so the 
chance coming together of the fragments for ligation has a very low 
probability. The approach to this problem is to put sticky ends on the 
blunt ended molecules. 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
129 
One way of doing this is to use the enzyme terminal transferase, which 
adds nucleotides on to the 3’-ends of DNA chains. So, for example, if one 
DNA fragment to be ligated is incubated with the enzyme in the presence 
of dGTP, a string of Gs will be added. If the other fragment is incubated 
with the enzyme and dCTP, a string of Cs will be added. These homo- 
polymers will then act as sticky ends. There is an extra problem here in 
that the tails are unlikely to be the same length so that, in addition 
to ligation, it will be necessary to fill in any gaps. The enzyme used for 
this purpose is the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. 
The process is summarized in Scheme 5.6. It is assumed that the 
G-tail is shorter than the C-tail (note that very short tail lengths are 
shown for convenience; in practice the tails might be 10-20 residues 
long). The Klenow fragment is used to fill in the missing Gs, and then 
DNA ligase links the chains together.

Cloning

~~ 
Cloning is the name given to the process by which foreign DNA mole- 
cules are introduced into living cells, although, as we shall see, the 
term properly applies to only a part of the process. Cloning was 
originally carried out using bacterial cells as the host, and we will 
concentrate mainly on that process. A cloning experiment proceeds 
it the following stages: 
The foreign DNA is incorporated into a vector, frequently a plasmid, 
using recombinant DNA technology 
The recombinant vector is introduced into the host bacterial cells, 
which are then spread thinly on a nutrient medium on which they can 
grow and divide. As this occurs, the vector with its inserted DNA is 
replicated and passed on to the daughter cells 
Each of the bacterial cells multiplies and produces a colony or clone. 
The clone originated from a single bacterial cell, and so all the cells in 
it express only a single type of recombinant DNA molecule 

130 
Nucleic Acids 
The importance of this technology lies in the following features. 
Firstly, it allows for the production of large amounts of a particular DNA 
molecule. We have already seen that DNA can be purified using gel 
electrophoresis, but the amounts that can be obtained by this route are 
small - typically a few nanograms. Once a clone containing the DNA of 
interest is obtained, the bacterial cells can be grown in culture, and it is 
then easy to obtain the cloned DNA in milligram amounts. Secondly, it 
provides a method of purifying the DNA. It is quite likely that the DNA 
sample obtained by elution from a gel may not be pure. After all, the 
method separates molecules based only on size, and it may be that two or 
more DNA molecules migrate at a very similar rate and so are extracted 
together. This will mean that more than one sort of recombinant 
plasmid is produced at the start of the cloning experiment. This is not, 
however, a problem. Each of the clones obtained will have originated 
from a bacterial cell containing only one sort of plasmid, and so it is 
simply a matter of identifying a clone that contains the plasmid with the 
DNA we want. 
A final benefit of cloning, but one of a rather different sort, arises if 
a special type of vector called an expression vector is used. Expression 
vectors contain not only an origin of replication that allows them to 
be copied, but also a set of expression signals that allow the inserted 
DNA to be transcribed, and the product RNA translated. This means 
that if the inserted DNA codes for a protein, the bacterial cell 
will now synthesize the foreign protein. This is the way in which 
proteins are produced by genetic engineering, the importance of which 
was described in Section 5.1. 
To see how cloning is actually carried out, we will take as an example 
the use of the plasmid pBR322, which was one of the earliest plasmids 
developed and still one of the most popular. 
An outline of some of the features of this plasmid has already been 
given in Figure 5.3, and it will now become clear how these features can be 
exploited in cloning. Note first the restriction sites for EcoRI, BamHl and 
PvuI. These are sites at which restriction fragments can be inserted in the 
plasmid. Suppose, for example, that we have carried out a restriction 
digest of DNA with BamHl, and have separated a fragment by gel 
electrophoresis. If the plasmid is cut with the same enzyme, the break in 
the plasmid will have the same sticky ends as the restriction fragment, 
and so can be ligated into the gap to yield a recombinant plasmid. 
The recombinant plasmid can then be introduced into E. coli cells. The 
trick to do this is to mix the cells and the plasmid in cold CaC12 solution, 
and then to raise the temperature briefly to 42 "C. Why this works is not 
clear, but the result is uptake of the plasmid into the cells, which are then 
said to be transformed. 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
131 
Transformation is not a very efficient process, and the next thing to do 
is to select those cells that have taken up plasmid from those that have 
not. This is where the genes for antibiotic resistance come in. pBR322 has 
a gene for ampicillin resistance, so if the bacteria are grown on a medium 
containing this antibiotic, the organisms that have taken up plasmid 
will survive but non-transformed bacteria will not. The ampicillin gene 
is referred to as a selectable marker because it allows selection of 
transformed cells. 
There is another problem. Some of the transformed cells will contain 
plasmid without an insert; that is, molecules that have simply re-closed 
during the ligation reaction. The reason for this is that an excess of 
plasmid over restriction fragment will have been used, and plasmid 
molecules that do not contain an insert will simply re-close. However, 
notice where the BarnHI site is. It is inside the gene for tetracycline 
resistance. Inserting a restriction fragment in this site will disrupt the 
resistance gene and prevent it from exerting its effect. So transformants 
containing plasmid with an insert will be sensitive to tetracycline, but 
those containing non-recombinant plasmid will be resistant. How can 
we make use of this fact? What is done is firstly to grow the bacterial cells 
on agar plates containing ampicillin. Only those cells which are 
transformants will grow and produce colonies. The colonies are now 
replica plated onto agar containing tetracycline. A filter paper is touched 
lightly onto the first plate so that a few cells from each colony are picked 
up, and is then touched onto the second plate so that the cells are 
deposited in the same positions as they occupied on the first. Now only 
the non-recombinant cells will grow. Colonies from cells with recombi- 
nant plasmids are those represented on the first plate but not on the 
second. This is summarized for clarity in Figure 5. 5. 
Once the recombinant colonies have been identified, it is relatively 
straightforward to identify those that contain the DNA of interest using 
hybridization methods (see Section 5.4). A membrane is overlaid onto the 
agar plate and some of the bacteria from each colony become attached. 
The bacterial cells are disrupted by treating the membrane with an 
alkaline solution followed by heating. This renders the DNA single 
stranded and fixes it to the membrane. The membrane can then be probed 
with a synthetic oligonucleotide as described for Southern blots.

plasmids. The colonies on the

The Polymerase Chain Reaction 
Another method for the amplification of DNA was developed in 1985 by 
Kary Mullis and his co-workers.' This is the polymerase chain reaction, or 
PCR as it is widely known. It is an amazingly powerful yet relatively 
simple method that has become one of the most widely used tools in 
molecular biology. It is essentially a chain copying method, the principles 
of which are outlined in Figure 5.7. 

136 
Nucleic Acids 
Figure 5.7 
The polymerase 
chain reaction 
Essential to the method are a pair of primers complementary to the 
two ends of the piece of DNA to be amplified. One of them is 
complementary to the 3'-end of one strand of the target DNA, and the 
other is complementary to the 3'-end of the other strand. Generally 
the primers used are about 20 nucleotides long. At the beginning of the 
experiment, the target DNA is heated at about 95 "C to separate the 
strands. The primers, DNA polymerase, and a mixture of the four 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates are added. The temperature is decreased 
to a value suitable for hybridization of the primers to the separated 
chains, as shown in Figure 5.7. An annealing temperature just below 
the melting temperature for the primer/DNA template is used (see 
equation 5.1). Chain copying will then occur in the 5/43' direction 
to yield two identical copies of the original molecule. The whole process 
of chain separation, annealing and chain synthesis is then repeated 
30 or 40 times, depending on the degree of amplification required. 
The process is very rapid and is amenable to automation. All that is 
required is to cycle the reaction mixture between the temperatures 
for chain separation, annealing and chain elongation. The cycle time is 
4-5 minutes. 
A little thought will show that the polymerase used must have rather 
unusual properties in that it must be able to withstand heating to 95 "C 
without losing its activity. The enzyme used is called Tuy pnl~ynzcrrisc. 
because it is obtained from the organism Therinus aquaticus. The enzyme 
is very thermostable and also works best at a relatively high temperature 
of about 75 "C; this is, therefore, the temperature used for the chain 
elongation step. 
A simple calculation shows that the degree of amplification achievable 
by PCR is very large indeed. At each step the amount of DNA present is 
doubled. So after 30 steps, an amplification of about 109-fold is 
obtained. 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
137 
As well as leading to a very high degree of amplification, PCR is also a 
very robust technique and can be used with partially degraded samples. 
The result of this is that it has proved possible to obtain sequence 
information from the tiny amounts of DNA that can be extracted from 
sources such as the fossilized bones, or preserved tissues, of extinct 
organisms (to this extent at least, the story line of Jurassic Park is not 
entirely science fiction!).

Figure 5.9 Fragments 
produced by partial cleavage of a 
DNA molecule at G residues 
Probably the single most important development in molecular biology in 
the second half of the 20th century was the invention of methods for the 
determination of base sequences of DNA molecules. In fact, the first 
nucleic acids to be sequenced were small RNA molecules (see Section 4.4). 
The reasons for this were two-fold. Firstly, they were relatively easy to 
purify. Secondly, and more important, RNases were available that 
allowed cleavage of the polynucleotide chains at specific bases. Never- 
theless, RNA sequence analysis was a slow and laborious process and is 
now very rarely undertaken. Sequence analysis of an RNA molecule is 
now done by sequencing the DNA that codes for it, and we will not deal 
with the classical methods here. 
Sequencing of DNA had to wait for the discovery of methods for 
specific fragmentation of these much larger molecules into pieces of 
manageable size, and for methods for increasing the quantities of the 
fragments available. That is, the discovery of restriction enzymes and the 
development of cloning were essential prerequisites for DNA sequencing. 
Equally important, someone had to have the inspiration to come up with 
a method for doing it. In fact, two methods were invented at more or less 
the same time. 
These methods have one thing in common: they depend on being 
able to measure the lengths of DNA fragments using polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis. They differ, however, in how those fragments are 
derived. 
Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert’ developed a method which 
depends on chain cleavage. In particular it involves the use of chemical 
procedures to break the DNA chain at a particular base. Consider 
for example, a reaction that cleaves DNA at G residues, and suppose 
that it is applied to a piece of DNA in such a way that only partial 
cleavage occurs at each G in the chain. The result would be as shown 
in Figure 5.9. That is, a set of fragments is generated, each of which 
terminates where a G was present in the original chain. By measuring 
the lengths of the fragments produced, the positions of the G residues 
are established. If four such cleavage methods could be developed, 
then application of each of them in turn to the DNA molecule would 
produce the sequence. It turns out that it is not quite as easy as that, 
because it is not possible to devise procedures that cleave the chain 
completely specifically at each of the four bases. Nevertheless, a viable 
method was developed and led to successful sequencing of DNA 
molecules. We will not, however, look any further at the details because 
the method is now used infrequently. This is because it is more difficult 
to use than the other available approach, and is not so amenable to 
automation. 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
139 
The method invented by Frederick Sanger and Alan Coulson 
involves chain copying, The initial approach was to carry out copying 
in reaction mixtures that contained a limited amount of one of the 
four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The result of this is to generate a 
set of partial copies that terminate at the position where the residue 
in limited supply was to be inserted in the chain. Even though this 
method worked well, and was successfully used to determine the 
sequence of the genome of a virus, it was soon superseded by an even 
better one." This is known as the dideoxy chain termination method, 
and is the basis of nearly all modern DNA sequencing. We will look 
at it in detail. 
First it is necessary to look at what a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate is. 
A typical example (dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, ddATP) is shown 
in 7. The particular feature to note is that the ribose ring lacks hydroxyl 
groups at both the 2'- and the 3'-positions. These molecules are 
recognized by DNA polymerase and are incorporated into polynucleo- 
tide chains in the normal way, but it should be obvious that once a 
dideoxy residue has been incorporated, chain growth stops. There is no 
3'-OH to which to add the next residue. The 3'-end of the chain would 
now have the structure shown in 8.

Suppose that we have a ssDNA molecule for which we know a short 
stretch of sequence at the 3'-end. We can then synthesize an oligonucleo- 
tide that is complementary to this know piece of sequence, and use it as a 
primer for chain copying by DNA polymerase (a Klenow fragment must 
be used to avoid exonuclease activity). Further suppose that, as well as 
the usual four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, we include in the reaction 
mixture a small amount (say 1%) of a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate. 
If the added dideoxynucleoside triphosphate is ddTTP, the outcome will 
be as shown in Figure 5.10.

The 3’-end of the ssDNA for which we know the sequence and for 
which a complementary primer has been synthesized is shown in red. 
The unknown part of the molecule is represented simply as a black line 
with the positions of the A residues specified. When chain copying is 
started and the first A at position 5 is reached, a dT will be inserted 
for most of the molecules being copied, but for a small fraction (about 
1%) ddT will be inserted and chain elongation will stop. This produces 
a fragment of length P+ 5, where P is the length of the primer, For the 
rest of the molecules, chain elongation proceeds to the next A at 
position 10, where again a small fraction of the new chains will have 
ddT inserted and will terminate giving a fragment of length P +  10. 
Clearly, what we will have at the end is a mixture of new chains, all of 
which terminate with a ddT residue (except the longest one, unless 
the last residue in the chain happens to be an A). Measurement of the 
lengths of those fragments will yield the positions of the A residues in 
the original ssDNA molecule. 
The experiment is now repeated three more times, in each case with a 
different ddNTP in the reaction mixture. At the end, the four reaction 
mixtures are run side by side on a polyacrylamide gel under conditions 
where the fragments are dissociated from the parent ssDNA molecule, 
and the positions of the bands observed. This is usually done by using 
radiolabelled ddNTP molecules in the reactions so that the gel can be 
viewed after autoradiography. 
Suppose that the actual sequence of the ssDNA molecule in 
Figure 5.10, excluding the part used for priming, was as in the legend 
of Figure 5.1 1. The band pattern expected after electrophoresis would be 
as shown in the figure. 
Tt is unnecessary to estimate the lengths of the fragments. All that is 
necessary is to read upwards from the bottom of the gel and see in which 
lane successive bands fall. The smallest fragment runs the furthest 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
141 
through the gel, and so the first residue in the sequence is a T followed by 
another T. Next comes a C then G, and so on. It is a simple matter to 
read the complete sequence from the gel. Remember, however, that the 
sequence as read is 3'+5', which is the opposite way around from the way 
that sequences are usually written. 
For simplicity, the sequence in Figure 5.1 1 is quite short. In practice, 
sequences up to 400-500 bases can be read from a single gel (longer 
sequences can be obtained using automated methods as described 
in Box 5.8). Note that as the pieces become longer, the bands move 
closer together. With very long sequences, the separation of the longer 
bands becomes less and less until a point is reached where it is no longer 
possible to distinguish them. This effect is apparent in Figure 5.12, 
which shows part of the autoradiograph obtained in an actual DNA 
sequencing experiment. 
One problem should immediately come to mind concerning this 
technique. It requires single-stranded DNA, whereas DNA is 
usually double stranded. The solution to this problem is provided 
by a phage called M13. This phage has a genome consisting of a 
circle of ssDNA. After infection of the E. coli host, the ssDNA acts 
as a template for synthesis of its complementary strand. The resulting 
double-stranded DNA (the replicative form) replicates in the usual 
way. When new phage particles are formed, the dsDNA is converted 
back into the single-stranded form and packaged into the viral 
proteins. These properties have been used to advantage in DNA 
sequencing. The double-stranded replicative form of the viral genome 
can be used just like a plasmid, and can be used for cloning dsDNA. 
Many different constructs have been produced, but a particularly 
useful one is called M13mp8. This variant of the replicative form 
DNA contains a polylinker, that is, a stretch of DNA containing 
recognition sites for a variety of restriction enzymes. The sequence of 
this part of the molecule is shown in Figure 5.13. The polylinker is in 
red, and some of the restriction sites that it contains are indicated. 
Pieces of dsDNA that have been produced using any of these 
restriction enzymes can be inserted into the polylinker. If E. coli cells 
are then transformed with the recombinant dsDNA, viral particles will 
be produced that contain only one of the two DNA strands (the 
upper one in Figure 5.13) and the inserted DNA can be sequenced 
directly. There is another advantage to this method. Since the inserted 
DNA is sequenced in situ, the ssDNA on the 3'-side of the polylinker 
can be used as the primer binding site, and the same primer can be

The other problem that might come to mind is what happens if we wish 
to sequence a piece of DNA that is longer than 400-500 bases? The 
answer depends on how long the DNA is. If it is, say, 800-1000 bases 
long, one approach would be to sequence it from both ends. The object of 
this is to find an overlapping complementary region at the ends of the two 
sequences that have been determined, as illustrated in Figure 5.15. The 
final bases assigned in the two sequences are shown explicitly, whereas the 
earlier ones are represented simply as lines. The ends of the two sequences 
are complementary, and hence the sequence of the entire molecule has 
been determined. Note that in practice a longer overlap than that shown 
would be required. The reason is that there are likely to be errors in the 
bases assigned at the very ends of the sequences, and so a long overlap is 
required to be certain that the two sequences are genuinely complemen- 
tary. Note also that, even with shorter molecules, it is good practise to 
sequence them from both ends to provide confirmatory evidence for the 
sequence assigned.

DNA genome in black, with an

sequence. The black and red 
lines may represent up to 
400-500 sequenced residues 
For somewhat longer molecules, a technique involving “walking” along 
the sequence can be used. The sequence of the first few hundred residues is 
determined in the usual way, and an oligonucleotide is synthesized which is 
complementary to the 5’-end of the sequence obtained. This oligonucleo- 
tide can then be used as a primer to extend the sequence further. The 
technique is illustrated in Figure 5.16. Several steps can be carried out, thus 
allowing the sequence analysis of quite large DNA molecules. The 
disadvantage of the method is, of course, that it requires a new oligo to be 
synthesized at each step in the walk along the molecule.

long molecule by “walking” along 
it. As much sequence as possible 
is determined in step 1. An oligo- 
nucleotide is then made with the 
sequence determined at the end 
of step 1. This is used to extend 
the sequence in step 2. The 
process is repeated until the 
end of the original molecule is 
reached. Primers are shown in red

~~ 
With DNA molecules thousands of nucleotides long, a more 
complicated technique is used. The approach is to do what is known as 
shotgun sequencing. The molecule is fragmented using a restriction 
enzyme and the fragments cloned into an M13 vector. Clones are 
randomly selected and sequenced. This will result in a set of partial 
sequences, but their order in the original molecule will be unknown. 
Fragmentation is then repeated with a second restriction enzyme to 
produce a second set of fragments, and these again are cloned and 
sequenced. This second set is then searched to find fragments which 
oterlap ones from the first digest. The sorts of results obtained are 
illustrated in Figure 5.17. 
For example, fragment 3 from the second set contains the 5’-end of 
fragment 1 and the 3’-end of fragment 2 from the first set, thus 
establishing the order of fragments 1 and 2 in the original molecule. 
Fragment 6 contains the 5’-end of fragment 2, all of fragment 4, and the 
complement of the 5’-end of fragment 5 (which has been sequenced in 
the reverse direction). Working through the two sets of fragments allows 
the original sequence to be reconstructed. The method is called a shotgun 
approach because it is unnecessary to obtain and sequence all of the 
fragments from both digests. What is required is a randomly selected set 
of fragments that allows the original sequence to be reconstructed (see 
Problem 5.6).

Computer Applications in DNA Chemistry 
Modern DNA chemistry would be impossible without the use of 
computational techniques. We have already seen (Box 5.8) that computers 
are used to collect, store and analyse the output from automated 
sequencing experiments. They are also indispensable for analysing the 

149 
Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
results of shotgun sequencing and recognizing the overlaps that allow 
fragments to be assembled into complete structures. For example, the first 
bacterial genome to be sequenced was that from Haemophilus irzfluenzae. l4 
The genome is 1.83 Mbp long. It was fragmented by mild sonication and 
the sequences of about 20,000 clones were determined. These sequences 
were assembled using a computer into 140 larger fragments (called contigs 
from contiguous sequences). The analysis required 30 h of computer time. 
Finally, the positions of the contigs in the genome were determined by 
using a hybridization method. Large fragments of the genome were cloned 
in h. Synthetic oligonucleotides from the ends of the contigs were used to 
screen the library. If oligonucleotides from two different contigs 
hybridized to the same clone, then it could be assumed that the contigs 
were adjacent in the genome. The point is that analysis of the experimental 
data would have been impossible without the aid of computers. Suites of 
software are available to carry out all the processes of data acquisition and 
analysis (for example, Lasergene from DNAStar Inc., or the Staden 
Package from the Medical Research Council, UK). These are mainly of 
interest to professionals in the field and will not be discussed further here. 
The other main uses for computers in this field are for the storage of 
sequence data and for its analysis. These activities constitute part of what 
has become known as bioinformatics. Central to bioinformatics has been 
the development of databases. These are repositories of, among other 
things, sequence information and programs to analyse the data. The data 
are very highly structured and annotated, with links provided to other 
relevant information, such as citations to where the particular sequencing 
results were published. There are many databases to choose from, but one 
of the most useful is at the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) in the USA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), 
and this is the one to 
which reference is usually made in what follows. There is a vast amount of 
information in this database, and the only way to get an appreciation of it 
is to go in and look around. 
The main repository of DNA sequence data is GcnBank, which on 15 
April 2003 contained 3 1,099,264,455 bases, from 24,027,936 reported 
sequences. By the time you read this, there will be much more. It is not too 
easy to appreciate just how much DNA sequence information that is, and 
how uninformative the raw data are without computational methods to 
analyse them. Some feel for the problem might be obtained by reference 
to Figure 5.22, which gives the sequence of the plasmid pBR32215 
(GenBank accession number J01749). This is a very small molecule by 
DNA standards, but it still requires more than a page to print it. If we 
assume that 3000 bases can be printed per page, then the human genome 
sequence would require 1,000,000 pages and would be the most boring set 
of books ever produced. Storage on computer is the only feasible option.

There are many questions that can be asked about a DNA sequence 
such as that in Figure 5.22. Obvious ones are what restriction sites are 
present and what open reading frames does it contain? Neither of these 
questions can be answered by visually examining the sequence, but it easy 
to write computer programs to do it. The single BamHI site and the three 
BgZI sites (refer to Figure 5.3) are shown in red in Figure 5.22. Their 
positions were obtained from the website http://www.fermentas.com/ 
techinfo/NucleicAcids/mappbr322. 
htm (see Problem 5.3). There are 
other websites which allow you to submit a DNA sequence and then 
return the positions of restriction sites of your choice. An example is 
located at the University of Massachusetts (http://web.umassmed.edu/ 
bioapps/rsites. html). 
An extremely important application of computers is finding open 
reading frames (or orfs, as they are often called) in DNA sequences. 
The computer reads along the sequence until it finds an initiation codon, 
and then continues until it reaches a stop codon. This stretch of sequence 
is potentially a coding sequence. The process is continued until the end of 
the DNA molecule. It is then repeated, starting at the second residue in 
the chain rather than the first; that is, it checks the second reading frame,

Finally, for the strand initially selected, the third potential reading 
frame is examined. The whole process is then repeated for the other 
DNA strand.

It is essential to note that this simple approach is applicable only to 
prokaryotes. With eukaryotes, we have the complicating problem of split 
genes (see Section 4.2). To identify protein coding regions of the genome 
we need ways of identifying the intron/exon boundaries. The ways of 
doing this are still being worked out, and we will not consider the matter 
further. Suffice it to say that it involves recognizing particular patterns in 
the DNA sequence, which again is a process which can only be done using 
computers. 
Once open reading frames have been found, the question arises as to 
which proteins they code for; that is, what is the function of that protein. 
The answer to this question is provided (if it can be provided) by database 
searching. The predicted amino acid sequence is compared with those of 
all of the proteins in a database looking for sequence similarities; that is, 
for regions where identical amino acids occur in the two proteins, or 
where the amino acids are of similar types. This is usually done using a 
program called BLAST (for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool")). In 
the simplest situation (see Worked Problem 5.5) the sequence is found to 
be identical to that of a protein already known, in which case the 
identification is obvious. 
In other cases, the protein might be found to be related to, rather than 
identical with, a protein that had been previously described. For example, 
consider the amino acid sequence labelled Query in Figure 5.24. It was 
derived from an open reading frame in the genome of the bacterium 
Helicobactev pylori. A BLAST search of the SwissProt database 

154 
Nucleic Acids 
(see Worked Problem 5.6 for how this is done) revealed that the sequence 
was related to those of several proteins that had already been identified as 
the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase from a variety of bacterial 
sources. Figure 5.24 shows the alignment of the query sequence with that 
of the enzyme from Bacillus suhtilis. The two sequences show 48% 
of identical residues (indicated by the entries in the middle line of 
the comparison), and in many cases where the residues are different, 
they are of similar types (indicated by+signs in the middle line). This 
high degree of similarity shows that the protein from H. pylori is also 
aspartate aminotransferase, the differences in amino acid sequence 
compared with the enzyme from B. subtilis having arisen by evolutionary 
changes since the time that the two organisms diverged from a common 
ancestor.

In this case, the two enzymes do not do exactly the same thing, but 
both of them are nucleases. This reflects the fact that proteins in living 
organisms fall into families with related functions. Members of these 
families have arisen by evolution of function from one or a small 
number of primitive proteins in our ancient ancestors. As a result of this 
family relationship, the amino acid sequences of the members are related 
even if, as in the case in Worked Problem 5.6, the relationship is very 
distant. It is still sufficient, however, to provide the clue to what the 
unknown protein does. 
In summary, then, the approach to assigning function to a protein 
whose amino acid sequence has been revealed by genome sequencing is to 
compare the sequence with those of all known proteins and to look 
for similarities. Similarities may allow definite, or at least tentative, 

158

assignment of function. Unfortunately, this does not always work. We 
still have only a partial knowledge of the complete range of protein 
structures and functions, and it is usually the case that a substantial 
fraction of the proteins coded by a newly sequenced genome cannot be 
identified in this way. There is still a long way to go before knowledge of 
the sequence of a genome will allow us to completely catalogue the 
proteins that an organism can make. 
5.1 0 Chemical Synthesis of Oligonucleotides 
~~ 
~ 
~ 
It should be clear from what has been said above that many of the modern 
methods of DNA analysis require the availability of synthetic oligo- 
nucleotides. Techniques such as PCR or dideoxy sequencing would be 
impossible without them. We will, therefore, finish this review of the tools 
of DNA chemistry with an account of how these molecules are made. 
The general approach to synthesis of oligonucleotides was developed 
by Khorana and his group in the 1970s. The essence of the method that 
they used is outlined in Scheme 5.9. The 5/-OH of a deoxynucleoside was 
protected with a group PI to eliminate its nucleophilic character. The 3‘- 
OH of a deoxynucleotide was similarly protected with a second group 
P2, and the phosphate activated with a good leaving group X. Reaction 
of these two species produced the desired phosphodiester linkage and 
yielded a protected dinucleotide. Subsequent removal of protecting 
group P2 then allowed for extension of the polynucleotide from the 3’- 
end. It was important that the two protecting groups could be removed 
under different conditions so that PI stayed in place when P2 was 
removed; that is, the 5/-OH of the dinucleotide continued to be 
protected. Note that three of the four bases also required protection; this 
is discussed below. 
Scheme 5.9 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis 
159 
This synthetic method was enormously powerful, and the crowning 
achievement of Khorana and his co-workers was the complete synthesis 
of a 126-residue long gene for a tRNA m~lecule.'~ 
There have been 
other significant advances in methodology in the last 20 years, and it is 
these newer methods that will be described in more detail below. 
Note, however, that the general approach used is still that pioneered by 
Khorana. 
One of the most significant advances in oligonucleotide synthesis 
has been in the chemistry of formation of the phosphodiester linkage. 
This is now almost always done using what is known as phosphoramidite 
chemistry. The technique was introduced by Caruthers and his colle- 
agues and has been reviewed.2" The reactions involved are outlined in 
Scheme 5.10. 
Scheme 5.10 
The chain is built up from the 3'-end, and the next residue is added 
to the 5'-OH of the growing chain. The derivative used for chain 
elongation is the protected 2-cyanoethylphosporamidite shown on the 
left of Scheme 5.10. These compounds are relatively unreactive, but 
in the presence of tetrazole, reaction occurs to form a more reactive 
phosphorotetrazolide intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with 
the 5'-OH of the growing nucleotide chain to form the required 
phosphorus-oxygen linkage. This is obviously not the desired final 
product; the phosphorus is in the form of a trivalent phosphite 
rather than the pentavalent phosphate. After coupling, therefore, the 
product is reacted with aqueous iodine which oxidizes the phosphorus 
(Scheme 5.11).

This method of making the phosphodiester linkage has several 
advantages, principal among which is that it can be made to proceed 
in very high yield (greater than 99%). This is crucial if oligonucleotides 
of any significant length are to be made. The reason is that overall 
yield of the product is strongly dependent on step yield. This is 
illustrated in Figure 5.27, where the overall yield is plotted as a 
function of the number of synthetic cycles for step yields of 90% and 
99%. Clearly a step yield of 90% is unacceptable for synthesis of’ a 
25mer since the overall yield is less than 10%. Even a step yield of 
99% results in a final yield of only about 80%, but it is not possible 
to do better than this. 
There is another problem associated with incomplete coupling. Any 
residual free 5’-OH groups can participate in reaction in the following 
cycle, thus leading to products with internal deletions. This will result in a 
mixture of products that would be hard to purify. For this reason, at the 
end of each reaction cycle a capping process is carried out. The product is 
reacted with ethanoic anhydride (acetic anhydride), with the result that 
any free 5’-OH groups are ethanoylated (acetylated) and not available for 
subsequent reaction (Scheme 5.12).

The other major advance in oligonucleotide synthesis has been the 
development of what are known as solid phase methods. This means that 

Modern Tools of DNA Analysis

the synthesis is not carried out in free solution, but rather with the 
growing oligonucleotide chain attached to a solid support, most usually 
a glass bead. The beads are packed into a column, and all the chemistry 
is carried out by passing reagents through the column. Similarly, side 
products of the reactions are removed simply by passing appropriate 
solvents through the column. Synthesis starts with the protected 
nucleoside that is to be the 3’-residue attached to the glass support 
viaan ester linkage to the 3’-OH group. The structure of a typical starting 
material is shown in 12.

There is a long linker joining the protected nucleoside to the glass. 
The point of this is to hold the growing chain away from the glass bead 
to ensure that reaction is not restricted by steric interactions with the 
support. Note that it is the linkage to the glass that provides protection 
for the 3’-OH group of the first residue in the chain. 
We need to look now at the other protecting groups. As shown in 
Scheme 5.10, the 5’-OH group of the incoming residue must be 
protected to prevent it from participating in the coupling reaction. 
After that reaction has occurred, the protecting group must be 
removed so that the 5’-OH is free to react in the next synthetic cycle. 
A major requirement is, then, that the protecting group must capable 
of being removed under conditions where neither the linkage to the 
glass support nor the newly formed inter-nucleoside linkage is affected. 
An ideal blocking group is dimethosytritjl. The structure of a growing 
chain with a dimethoxytritylated 5’-OH is shown in Scheme 5.13. This 
group is quite labile and is readily removed by brief exposure to 
trichloroethanoic acid (trichloroacetic acid) in dichloromethane to 
yield the dimethoxytrityl cation (Scheme 5.13). An added advantage 
of using dimethoxytrityl as the protecting group is that the cation 
is highly coloured, and its release from the protected derivative can 
be monitored by spectrophotometry to ensure that de-protection is 
complete.

Three of the four bases contain reactive amino groups that require 
protection during oligonucleotide synthesis. The protecting groups used 
have to be stable to the mild acid conditions used to remove the 
5’-dimethoxytrityl group, but sufficiently labile that they can be removed 
at the end of the synthetic process. The derivatives usually used are 
N6-benzoyladenosine (13), p-benzoylcytosine (1 4) and N2-isobutyryl- 
guanosine (15).

When synthesis is complete, the oligonucleotide is removed from 
the solid support, the bases de-protected, and the 2-cyanoethyl group 
removed from the phosphate. All of these can be achieved by treat- 
ment with aqueous ammonia. Breakage of the link to the glass support 
and the removal of the base protecting groups are base-catalysed 
hydrolysis reactions. Removal of the 2-cyanoethyl group is a base- 
catalysed p-elimination reaction, yielding propenenitrile (acrylonitrile; 
Scheme 5.14).

Finally, the oligonucleotide may require purification. Even if each step 
of synthesis proceeds 99% to completion, a 50mer will contain only 
60% of the desired product, the remainder being shorter sequences. The 
best way to achieve purification is by using either polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. 
A great virtue of the solid phase method for oligonucleotide synthesis is 
that it is amenable to automation, and indeed there are now several 
machines on the market for automated oligonucleotide synthesis. These 
machines have a small column into which is loaded the glass support with 
the 3'-residue attached, and reagent reservoirs to contain the protected 
and activated nucleosides and other reagents used during the cycle. The 
desired sequence is then entered into a microprocessor, and the machine 
does the rest. The cycle time is a matter of only a few minutes and so 
oligos up to 100 residues long can be synthesized in a day. There are also 
many companies that offer custom synthesis, and these large centres may 
be making up to 10,000 oligos per day. Because of the enormous efficiency 
of the process, prices of synthetic oligos are now very low, typically E0.30 
or US $0.50 per base; for many laboratories where the requirement for 
oligos is only modest, it is more economic to have them custom made 
rather than to invest in an automated synthesizer.

5.1. This is a very favourable case because three of the amino 
acids are coded by single codons and the other two by two codons 
(see Table 1.3). As a result, a mixture of only four oligos is required. 
The easiest way to see this is to write the possible coding sequences 
as shown below:

The oligos required are then ATGTATTGGCATATG, ATGTAT- 
TGGCACATG, ATGTACTGGCATATG and ATGTACTGGCA- 
CATG. The Us in the RNA codons are, of course, replaced by Ts in 
the oligos. 
Using equation (5. l), the T, for the first oligo listed can calculated 
as 40 OC, and that for last as 44 "C. These values are low because of 
the preponderance of A and T in the sequences. 
Glycine is specified by 4 codons, and so including it in the site 
would increase the number of oligos required to 16. However, by 
including only the first two bases of the glycine codons (GG) the 
probe length is increased by two without increasing the number of 
oligos required. 
5.2. 
Although the recognition sites of BamHI and BgZII are 
different (GGATCC and AGATCT, respectively), they both cut 
after the first base and the central four bases are the same. Hence the 
sticky end produced in both cases has the sequence GATC. 
5.3. The easiest way to do this is by logging on to the site http:// 
www .fermentas .com/techinfo/ NucleicAcids/mappbr322. htm. Click 
on Restriction sites ofthepBR322 DNA. The new page contains a list 
of all enzymes that cleave the molecule. The site for PvuI is shown to 
be at position 3733. Note that this is the position of the first base in 
the recognition sequence (check it in Figure 5.22). 
Alternatively, log on to http://web.umasmed.edu/bioapps/ 
rsites.htm1. This site requires that the sequence to be searched is 
entered in the Sequence Entry box. You clearly will not want to type 
it in, so go to the NCBI, retrieve the pBR322 sequence, copy it, and 
paste it into the box. In the section Restriction Enzyme Selection, 
highlight PvuI, check on Explicit Pick from Above List, and then 
Submit Sequence, The result will show that there is one site for PvuI 
and show its position as 3737. In this case, the position quoted is that 
of the base after which the cut occurs. 
5.4. 
The best way to see what is required is to write out the 
complementary sequences at the two ends of the molecule as 
follows: 
5'-TTCTCATGTTTGACA--------- TTTCGTCTTCAAGAA- 3' 
3'-AAGAGTACAAACTGT-------- AA AGCAGAAGTTCTT- 5' 

180 
Nucleic Acids 
Reference to Figure 5.11 shows that we require an oligo 
complementary to the 3’-end of the upper sequence, and this is 
simply the 5’-end of the lower sequence. One of the required 15mers 
is, therefore, 5’-TTCTTGAAGACGAAA-3’. Similarly, we require 
an oligo complementary to the 3’-end of the lower sequence and this 
will be 5’-TTCTCATGTTTGACA-3’. 
5.5. It should be possible to read at least 100 bands. On the 
(larger) original of this figure, about 140 could be read with 
reasonable confidence. The sequence read, starting from the 
prominent band at the bottom of the C track, and reversing it to 
read 5/43! was: 
5’- CGTCCCGGCCTTGTACACACCGCCCGTCACACCATGG 
GAGTTTGTTGCACCAGAAGTAGGTAGTCTAACCTTAGG 
GGGGACGCTTACACGGTGTGGCAGATGACTGGGGTGA 
AGTCGTAACAAGGTAGCCGTAGGGAAC- 3’ 
5.6. This is very difficult because the partial sequences are not all 
from the same chain, as shown by the fact that there are no overlaps 
from the end of one fragment to the beginning of another. It can be 
done by first writing down the fragment sequences and their 
complements: 
5’ tgaagtggtggcctaactacggct 
3’acttcaccaccggattgatgccga 
5’ gaca g t a  t tt ggta t c tgcgct c t gc 
3’ctgtcataaaccatagacgcgagacg 
5’aatactgtccttctactgtagccg 
3’ t t a t ga ca gga ag a t ga c a tcggc 
It can now be seen that the third sequence comes between the first 
and second, but that it was sequenced from the complementary 
chain. The complete sequence can now be assembled into: 
with the overlaps in bold and italics. 
(Note: this problem was intended as a demonstration of the fact 
that fragment assembly by eye can be very difficult with only three 
fragments, and gets to be virtually impossible with more than three. 
It is always done in practice by computer.)
