witter recently extended
the number of characters
you can use in a tweet from
140 to 280, but sometimes you
need even more room to make
your point. One way to do this is
to create a thread by continuing
to reply to your own tweet until
you’ve got everything off your
chest. The main problem with
this, however, is that other people
replying to your tweets will
interrupt the sequence, making your
train of thought difﬁcult to follow.
To help, Twitter has introduced an
official ‘threads’ feature which keeps
these tweets together, thereby
making them easier to read as
a whole. It has done this by adding
a plus (+) button whenever you start
a new tweet. Selecting this opens up
another tweet-composing box,
allowing you to carry on typing.
When you reach the end of that box,

Do some of your Facebook friends bore you to tears with
their rants, memes and seen-it-all-before photos? Then you
may want to use Facebook’s new ‘snooze’ button to
temporarily mute them. The social network’s latest feature
lets you mute connections for
30 days while still remaining
pals. It’s less dramatic than the
Unfollow button and it helps to
put you in greater control of
what you want to see at any
particular moment in time.
What’s more, it even works with
Pages and Groups. All you have
to do is tap the three-button
menu within a post from
someone you’re tiring of. You
can then select the new Snooze
option. Once the 30 days are
up, you’ll start seeing that
person or company’s posts
again, but it may give you
some respite from the usual
barrage of baby photos or
relentless political rants.

Need to Know
8 10 - 23 January 2017
What happened?
Apple has admitted that it slowed the
performance of older iPhones in order
to preserve battery life, but failed to
warn users and now faces legal action.
The lithium-ion batteries that power
most phone batteries eventually wear
out, usually around the two-year mark,
although this depends on a host of
factors including how many times the
phone has been recharged and even the
temperature where you live. That
doesn’t mean these batteries entirely
fail, but they don’t work as efficiently.
Some iPhones have been known to
crash during peak power usage, such as
when launching apps, so Apple came up
with its own solution, rolling out an
update to iOS, the operating system
that runs iPhones. This update adjusted
the code to better manage power-use
peaks, which meant that apps would
sometimes launch more slowly.
Apple didn’t tell iPhone users it was
making the change, which rolled out
on several different models of the
handset, but users noticed the slower
performance and started to complain
online. Software company Primate Labs
benchmarked the devices and proved
the phones had indeed been slowed.
Now, Apple faces a slew of class-
action lawsuits from customers who are
angry that their iPhones were meddled
with. Cases have popped up across the
US, as well is in Europe and Israel,
accusing Apple of damaging their
phones in violation of consumer law.
The company has issued a statement
containing an apology and explanation
on its website (bit.ly/apple440).
How will it affect you?
The controversial update was rolled out
last year, so you’ve probably already
installed it. The update in question, iOS
10.2.1, featured code that altered power
management during certain activities.
The change affected the iPhone 6,
6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus and the iPhone SE,
though the company extended it to
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus later with
the iOS 11.2 update. Apple says it made
the change to reduce the number of
“unexpected shutdowns”, or times when
your smartphone crashes and restarts,
so you may have noticed your handset
is now better behaved. On the other
hand, your apps may take longer to
launch and other heavy-demand
activities may run more slowly.
Apple has reduced the price of a
replacement battery from £79 to £25
for the iPhone 6 or older; if you take up
this offer, Apple says your device’s
performance will automatically return to
normal. Any newer models with a failing
battery should still be under warranty.
Apple has also promised to roll out an
update early in 2018 that displays
information about the condition of an
iPhone’s battery, so we can better
understand the impact on performance.
What do we think?
This incident highlights two aspects of
modern technology. First, it shows the
value of replaceable batteries. A decade
ago, an easily removable battery that
could be replaced when it was out of
charge or wearing out was a common
feature of smartphones – though never
the iPhone. It took no specialist
knowledge or skill, and helped extend
the life of smartphones without fiddling
with code or reducing performance.
However, the trend toward ever-
slimmer handsets means manufacturers
have started to follow Apple’s lead,
glueing in batteries and making them
difficult – but not impossible – to
remove. If you want to try replacing
your smartphone’s battery, head to
iFixit.com for easy-to-follow instructions
for most major models.
Secondly, this incident once again
draws attention to Apple’s rather
high-handed attitude, which suggests it
sometimes thinks its customers can’t be
trusted to make decisions about their
own handsets.
We think iPhone owners should have
been trusted with the full story and
offered the software update, with a full
explanation of the effects on the battery
and performance, or the discounted
battery replacement. Apple doesn’t
appear to trust its own users to make
decisions about their own property, and
continues to lack transparency as a
company. Hopefully the looming
lawsuits will teach Apple a lesson.

Need to Know
What happened?
Kodi media-streaming
software will finally
support the Xbox One,
allowing you to watch
TV via the console if you
own one.
The Xbox One was
released in 2013 and has
since been superseded by
the Xbox 360, so this
update feels long overdue.
The Kodi software first
appeared as Xbox Media
Centre (XBMC)
on the original Xbox, and
was renamed in 2014 to
Kodi, but it has never
worked on later versions of
the Xbox due to a number
of compatibility reasons.
Those obstacles have
now been overcome thanks
to a rather surprising
source: Microsoft. By
forcing app developers to
produce software that
works on 64-bit systems,
The Windows creator
inadvertently made it
easier to port Kodi back to
Xbox consoles.
How will it affect you?
If you own an Xbox One,
you’ll be able to run Kodi
on it and output the
resulting streams to your
Kodi now available
for the Xbox One
TV. That support will arrive
later this year in Version 18,
but be warned: Kodi’s
coders have stressed the
Xbox support is limited
and may be missing a few
features.
Those missing bits
include no access to
external hard drives or the
Xbox One Blu-ray drive,
and only limited availability
for accessing certain video
and music folders.
Additionally, some Kodi
plugins might not work yet.
What do we think?
The port back to Xbox is a
timely reminder that Kodi
and its predecessor XBMC
have been kicking around
as a legitimate video player
for well over a decade –
it’s only recently that the
streaming software has
become a battleground for
online piracy.
Whatever the reason for
this long overdue support
for the Xbox One, it’s
unlikely that most users
will access Kodi in this way.
The limitations of this early
version of the app make it
less attractive than the
many other devices that
can be used with Kodi.
What
happened?
Some Android
apps can listen
to your
surroundings
and analyse
the ambient
noise to
understand
what you’re
watching and
where you are.
The creepy surveillance
system is made by a
startup called Alphonso,
which taps into your
smartphone or smart TV
microphone to listen to
sounds, analysing them to
understand what you’re
doing.
The games and apps can
eavesdrop even when
you’re not actually using
them, turning on your
microphone to nab a quick
snippet of sound whenever
they please. The startup
says it doesn’t record
human speech but the
content that’s being
listened to or watched – at
home, at a friend’s house
or even at the cinema.
How will it affect you?
The 250 or so apps using
the system must ask for
permission first, but the
text isn’t always clear or
prominently displayed.
When installing new
apps, always read the finer
details in the pop-ups they
show asking for
permission, including the
“further details” or “more
information” tabs. For this
particular spying system,
look for the name
Alphonso or the phrase
Android apps secretly
listen to users
“Automated Content
Recognition software”.
In this case, the audio
samples aren’t linked to
your name, but are
“hashed” and compared
anonymously with existing,
known digital content, so
the company has a sense
of what people are
watching in order to
display advertising that’s of
interest to you. The
technology is even being
used in children’s apps,
according to a New York
Times report.
What do we think?
Digital advertising is out of
control. Tapping our
phones and TVs to listen in
on our music and TV
choices feels like a gross
invasion of privacy,
regardless of whether
users have ticked a box to
opt in. Regulators have
slapped down companies
for using such technologies
before, and it’s clearly time
for tougher action.
We need to be able to
trust our smart devices to
do what we expect, not act
against our self interest,
or such companies should
expect us to stop using
them altogether.

Garmin Vivoactive 3
bit.ly/garmin440
The Garmin Vivoactive 3 is a fitness
wearable that you’ll never want to
take off. You can wear it when
exercising, but also while you’re going
about your normal daily activity,
walking around the house, to and
from the shops, and while you’re
sleeping. It can be used to track
swims as well as runs, bike rides and
gym sessions, plus it delivers
notifications like a proper smartwatch
– a job it is surprisingly good at.
It’s not quite a smartwatch in the
sense of an Android Wear or Apple
Watch, because the number of apps
that can be installed isn’t as broad.
Think of it instead as a wearable that
bridges the gap between a fitness
device and a smartwatch.
to 50m so you can take it for a swim,
and the Gorilla Glass screen should be
resistant to scratches and scuffs.
Battery life is superb – we found it
lasted six days between charges when
not using the GPS, which trounces
many of its competitors. The only
disappointments are the lack of
on-watch music playback
and the Garmin Pay
contactless-payment
system, which no UK
banks or credit cards
currently support.
Overall, though, the
Garmin Vivoactive 3 is an
impressive fitness watch.
It’s usable and accurate,
has GPS, altimeter and
heart-rate sensors, and
tracks all your regular
fitness activities.
What happened?
After years of campaigning, access to
high-speed broadband will soon be
written into law as a legal right for
everyone in the UK. A Universal Service
Obligation will be introduced by 2020
to make sure everyone can request
– and get access to – connection speeds
of at least 10Mbps. Ofcom defines
‘decent’ broadband speeds as 10Mbps
for downloads and 1Mbps for uploads.
However, thousands of UK properties
are currently unable to achieve these
speeds, particularly in rural areas.
Digital Minister Matt Hancock added
a caveat to the announcement by saying
the plans will give people the right to
ask for high-speed broadband by 2020,
even though a connection can’t be
guaranteed by that date. The
Conservative party’s 2017 manifesto
pledged that “by 2020, every home
and every business in Britain [will have]
access to high-speed broadband”.
This is a step toward that, but Hancock’s
proviso suggests that the commitment
may have been a tad over-ambitious.
The minister did not expand on the
details of the legislation.
This announcement follows Ofcom’s
recent Connected Nations report (bit.ly/
connected440), which said around
1.1 million UK properties are in areas
that can’t get acceptable broadband.
Slow broadband speeds for 17% of
High-speed broadband to be a legal right
residents in rural areas is unacceptable
compared to 2% in urban areas.
“Broadband coverage is improving,
but our findings show there’s still urgent
work required before people and
businesses get the services they need,”
said Ofcom’s technology chief Steve
Unger. “Everyone should have good
access to the internet, wherever they
live and work.”
How will it affect you?
If you live in an area with slow
broadband, this is good news and
means internet providers can no longer
fob you off with excuses about why
you’re not getting an acceptably fast
connection. Sadly, you’re still going to
have to wait two years until the
legislation comes into force and, even
then, you won’t be guaranteed 10Mbps
broadband straight away.
What do we think?
It’s about time the government did
something about the state of broadband
in the UK, which lags far behind many
other countries. However, we wish the
10Mbps minimum could be introduced
earlier than 2020, by which time it will
seem comparatively slow. Rural areas
need a solution for poor internet speeds
now, not merely the right to ask for it in
two years’ time. Still, we’re pleased that
the government at least recognises the
importance of a ‘decent’ connection.
Priced at £270, the Vivoactive is more
expensive than the TomTom Adventurer
(£226) and Spark 3 Cardio (£169).
However, those watches don’t provide
notifications and aren’t nearly as sleek,
lightweight and comfortable.
It offers all the sensors you need
for virtually any fitness-tracking task
you can think of:
on its rear, there’s
an optical
heart-rate sensor;
inside, it contains
GPS and
GLONASS radios,
a barometric
altimeter,
compass,
accelerometer
and thermometer.

Zanco Tiny t1
bit.ly/zanco440 | From £30
The Zanco Tiny t1 bucks the trend toward ever-bigger
smartphones. Described as the “world’s smallest phone”,
this miniature mobile measures a mere 46.7 x 21mm and
weighs only 13g. This makes it easy to slip into any garment
when you need to travel light, and to keep as a backup or emergency phone.
It operates on the 2G network, stores up to 50 text messages and 300 contacts,
and offers three days of standby and 180 minutes talk time. The Zanco team
looks set to smash its target of £25,000 by 18 January.
The rumour that Google
plans to introduce
ad-blocking functionality
in its browser, Chrome,
has been doing the
rounds for a while, though
details as to why, how
and when were scarce.
Now, the internet giant
has announced that its
new ad-blocking policy
will be enacted from
15 February – well, sort of.
The feature will be built
into Chrome, automatically
removing particularly annoying adverts
without the need for third-party tools,
which have rocketed in popularity in
recent years. The policy will only apply
to repeat offenders; a lone low-quality
ad isn’t sufficient for Google to come
down on the culpable website.
Google is already part of the
‘Acceptable Ads’ scheme offered by
Adblock Plus, which allows some ads
to be displayed – for a fee. Developing
its own ad-blocking feature is going one
step further, however. Why would a
company that generated $60bn in
revenue from online advertising in 2016
alone want to block adverts?
Speculation is that this laudable move
is a way for Google to curb the worrying
growth of third-party ad blockers. By
offering its own service within Chrome,
Google can wrestle back some control
over which online ads are filtered.
Will Chrome start
blocking online ads?
What’s new on Kickstarter
Our favourite new project on the crowdfunding site
Google will base its judgements on
standards laid out by the Coalition for
Better Ads (bit.ly/coalition440),
which the internet giant joined last
year. The idea is that ads for
consumers should be improved, with
vulgar and ostentatious ads (think
full-page, flashing or unexpectedly
noisy) discouraged and banned.

Google is only planning to target

Chrome, to dissuade people from
installing third-party ad blockers.
We certainly haven’t seen the

is now set to exert even more
control over them.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:

(www.nordvpn.com)
Q
What are the
best security
apps for my
smartphone?
Georgia Storey, Twitter
A
Signal (signal.org)
is an encrypted
messaging and
voice-calling app that
provides end-to-end
encryption to secure all
20% of web users fall for
phishing scams
One fifth of British
web users have
fallen victim to
phishing scams,
according to
research by
webmail service
GMX. In the run up
to Christmas, GMX
found that the most frequent type
of phishing attack involved criminals
faking emails from parcel suppliers
and using track-and-trace links
as a gateway to malware.
Because more people receive
parcels at Christmas, the criminals’
rate of success was statistically
higher, making it an effective way to
steal victims’ details, the company
explained. Although half of phishing
recipients usually delete malicious
emails as soon as they receive them,
just under a quarter (24%) mark them
communications.
The app can also
verify the identity
of anyone you are
messaging and the integrity
of the channel they are using.
When texting non-Signal
users, you can invite them
to an encrypted conversation
via Signal.
Tor Messenger
(bit.ly/tormess440)
is an encrypted
messenger from the
makers of the Tor browser.
The app enables greater
anonymity with Off-The-
Record (OTR) messaging –
a safe and encrypted way to
have private conversations
over Tor’s network of
computers.
Norton Identity
Safe (bit.ly/
norton440) gives
you freedom from
remembering passwords:
it saves all usernames and
passwords on your Android
phone or iPhone, and syncs
them across your devices.
Secure passwords can be
created within the app and
it also allows for faster
checkout and fills in forms
with your bank info.
Keeply
(inappshrimp.com)
is a spy-level app
that stores your
private moments and data –
PINs, credit cards, notes,
photos and videos – on your
phone. Its Fake Pin feature is
an alternative password
you can give to nosy
friends or family – when
they enter it, Keeply shows
an empty application.
It can also take a photo of
anyone who enters a wrong
PIN code into your phone.
Best of all: everything is
stored only on your device.
Finally, Best
Phone Security
Pro (bit.ly/
best440) is an
iPhone app that rings an
alarm if an unauthorised
person touches your
device. You can choose the
lock option: Touch ID,
pattern lock or passcode
lock – and even record
your own alarm sound.

Mr Robot add-on angers
Firefox users
Mozilla experienced a backlash after
a Mr Robot-themed add-on was
automatically installed in its browser,
causing concern among users that they
were being spied on by hackers. Firefox
users reported that a mysterious
extension called Looking Glass had
appeared in their browsers without their
permission, which added text to certain
websites, including phrases such as
“My Reality is Different Than Yours”.
Unsurprisingly, this raised fears that
the extension
was some type
of malicious
code, particularly
as users were
given no
indication that
it had been installed, nor any
information as to its function.
According to Mozilla, the Looking Glass
add-on was actually a collaborative
effort with the team behind the
Mr Robot TV series, designed as
a “shared experience to further your
immersion into the Mr Robot universe”.
The extension only appeared in the
browser if the user had given Firefox
permission to install Shield Studies,
which Mozilla uses to test new
features. It tweaked websites with
clues for people playing a Mr Robot-
themed puzzle game. However, the
forced installation led some users to
accuse Mozilla of abusing its position.

Reviews by David Crookes
BBC Own It
www.bbc.com/ownit
To ensure that children remain safe
online, it’s crucial that they’re made
aware of the potential dangers they face.
Rather than strike fear into youngsters,
however, the BBC’s new Own It site takes
a balanced approach, recognising that
online life is vital for young people while
also helping them deal with everything
from malware to cyberbullies. Aimed at
nine to 12-year-olds, Own It uses video,
text, quizzes and images to cover key
issues, while cannily throwing in fun stuff
such as tips on interviewing celebs. The
hope is that the message gets through
to kids without appearing preachy.
You really have to applaud the effort.
Asos
www.asos.com
Asos is the place to go for the latest
fashion, but when the online retailer
relaunched its website recently, it caused
widespread anger. Some users said they
didn’t like any change while others
bemoaned the loss of the sidebar menu
and ‘quick view’ feature. We think the
new site is sleeker and more stylish than
the old one. Its new horizontal navigation
bar makes light work of finding items,
the search bar is more prominent and the
pages are clear, easy to share and
packed with detail. The images are large
and well-shot, too, and there’s plenty
to inspire you, not least in the Style feed.

Healthier Together
what0-18.nhs.uk
This health-focused website dealing with children and young people from birth to 18
is for residents of Wessex, but it’s packed with information that’s relevant to all. It’s
well designed and offers comprehensive coverage of topics such as tummy aches,
asthma, pregnancy and emotional behaviour. It’s very user-friendly, too. Some
sections use a traffic-light system so parents can tell at a glance when symptoms
require urgent medical attention, while others provide a list of symptoms and
explanations of what to do to help. All advice is written by NHS medical experts, and
the site works well on mobile devices, so you’ll always have the information to hand.

Bringing together 14 of Edinburgh’s

relaunched site lets you search for
exhibitions and events in the capital and
browse some of the highlights. Using its
excellent search engine, you can specify
exactly what you’re looking for, when
you’re likely to visit and the venue you’re
interested in, and there’s information
about volunteering, too. We like the way
the venue pages offer some historical

Menu Museum

A website full of historic food menus may
not sound particularly appetising, but it’s
likely to leave you hungry for more.
Produced by academics at the University
of Brighton to aid hospitality students,
it features more than 500 menus so far,
ranging from a 1996 Pizza Express menu
– Margheritas for £3.40 – to a Savoy
menu from 1973. You can search the
mouthwatering collection using various
criteria, from description and country to
year and price range. The creators hope
students will use it to review trends in
menu design and cost while analysing
changing tastes in food and drink.
Pinpoint

This property site covering Northern

preview properties from the search bar
and save your searches as you go. You
can even make offers online and use
PayPal in transactions with Pinpoint.
With email alerts and a smattering of

interested, it’s a real step up the ladder.

People say business and pleasure

otherwise. Dealing with the industry
side of video games, it keeps you up
to date with news about the people

the move to a new grid layout, with

so, it suffers from a few teething
problems. The search engine couldn’t

in their footsteps by suggesting a two-day travel itinerary of places connected to
them, which includes suggestions of where to stay and maps of the journey.

Rotten Apples

As Hollywood continues to reel from
accusations of sexual harassment, you
may want to check that a film you’re
about to watch hasn’t been tainted in
any way. Rotten Apples – a riff on
movie-review aggregation site Rotten
Tomatoes – tells you if a film is tied to
someone accused of sexual misconduct,
whether it’s an actor, screenwriter,
executive producer or director. Simply
enter the name of a movie or TV show
into the search engine and, if it’s in the
database, names may appear. Clicking a
name takes you to an article about that
person, while films that have been given
the all-clear are dubbed Fresh Apples.

Help Out Nottingham
www.helpoutnottingham.co.uk
As with many British cities, social
and economic issues have led
to an increase in homelessness in
Nottingham. This portal aims to help
those who are begging or sleeping
rough to get off the city’s streets,
but though it makes a good attempt
to separate fact from fiction, it feels
rather dry. There are no case studies,
for example, and too few images.
We also felt the section encouraging
people to donate time or money to
homeless charities should be more
prominent. This makes the site
a chore to read, which is a shame
because its work is very valuable.

New SEO guide from Google
Search engine optimisation (SEO)
is the art of manoeuvring your
website up the list of results that’s
displayed after an online search.
Search engines such as Google
use thousands of different factors
to work out their results, and
most of those are secret – to stop
people cheating their sites up the
rankings. However, there are
guidelines available and Google
has just updated its own Search
Engine Optimisation Starter Guide
(bit.ly/seo440), which has plenty
of advice for anyone interested in

Send international visitors to

Amazon has updated its
WordPress plugin for affiliate
sales (bit.ly/amaz440) so that it
automatically directs visitors to

site builders don’t have to include
links to lots of different Amazon
stores in order to benefit from
their international visitors.
Unfortunately, you still have to
have an affiliate account set up
with each country’s store, but at
least it keeps your site looking
neater, with a single Amazon link
that will work for all your visitors.

Q
I’ve been told that websites
should have a ‘static IP’. What
is this and do I really need one?
Daniel Ellis, via email
A
They might have meant that you
need a dedicated IP. There’s some
potential confusion for site owners
over the different types of IP – static,
dynamic, shared and dedicated.
A static IP is something you might request
as part of your broadband service, so that
you always have the same IP address, which
is useful if you want to connect to devices on
your network remotely, for example.
A dedicated IP address used to be
necessary for running secure HTTPS (SSL)
sites but it’s no longer essential. There’s no
limit on the number of sites that can share a
single IP address.

Watch Sky’s epic Britannia
From 18 January
The huge, global success of HBO’s Game of Thrones has resulted
in a raft of similar – but generally not as good – shows from rival
broadcasters, including Vikings, Spartacus, The Bastard
Executioner and The Last Kingdom. The latest such epic to grace
our screens is Britannia, a Sky Original series with high production
values and a quality British cast. It’s set in 43AD, during the
Roman invasion of Britain, and features warrior women and
powerful druids. The cast is led by the always-excellent David
Morrissey (The Walking Dead), who plays Roman General Aulus,
and Kelly Reilly (True Detective), as Celtic princess Kerra.
Other famous (but not always recognisable) faces in the show
include Zoe Wanamaker, Ian McDiarmid, Julian Rhind-Tutt and
Mackenzie Crook.
The first season consists of 10 episodes, and you’ll be able to
watch all of them from 18 January on Sky Atlantic and Sky’s
streaming services Now TV and Sky Go.
A trailer, providing the first look at the new show, is available to
view at bit.ly/brit440 – just be aware before you press Play that
it’s quite violent and gory. If you saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi at
the cinemas recently, you might have already seen this trailer
because it was screened before the movie.
Pick of the fortnight
Watch Fargo Season 3
From 20 January
Each season of Fargo
– the darkly comedic
crime drama loosely
based on the 1996
Coen Brothers film of
the same name –
features a fresh cast,
and this time around it’s
headed by Ewan
McGregor (pictured, right),
who pulls double duty by
playing two brothers, Ray and Emmit
Stussy. Season 3 takes place between
December 2010 and March 2011 and,
somewhat unusually, isn’t set in Fargo,
North Dakota but rather in three
Minnesota towns. You don’t need to
have seen either of the previous two
seasons to watch this one because the
characters and plot are all new. There’s
some quality acting on display – both
McGregor and his co-star David Thewlis
were nominated for Golden Globes for
their roles in the show, which was first
screened on Channel 4 last summer.
Watch the trailer for Fargo at bit.ly/
fargo440.
Watch Van Helsing
Season 2
From 19 January
TV’s obsession with
supernatural creatures
continues unabashed.
As you can guess from
the name of this Syfy
show, Van Helsing is
based on the classic
Dracula story, though it
takes place “in the near
future”. Vanessa Van Helsing
(played by Kelly Overton), a descendent
of famed vampire hunter Abraham Van
Helsing, wakes from a coma to discover
that vampires have risen up and taken
over the world. She’s pretty much
mankind’s last hope, thanks to the fact
that she has some weird special powers,
super-fast healing and blood that can
turn vampires back into humans. If it all
sounds a bit mad, it totally is. You can
watch the trailer for season 2 of Van
Helsing at bit.ly/van440.
Watch Homeland Season 6
From 15 January
American drama Homeland returns for
a new season on Netflix. Carrie Mathison
(played by Claire Danes) is now back
home in the US and working as an
advocate for Muslim Americans. Season
6 was originally shown in America at the
start of 2017 (and Channel 4 in the UK),
shortly after Donald Trump was sworn
into office, and the action here takes
place between the election and
inauguration dates. However, it’s not
Trump who comes into power but
a female president-elect (no doubt
inspired by Hillary Clinton).
20 10 - 23 January 2018
What To Watch Online

Meanwhile, hot from the US, the
brand new (and penultimate) Season 7
will be screened on Channel 4 and All4.
Watch Black Lightning
From 23 January
US broadcaster The CW is home to a
number of superhero TV shows based
on DC Comics properties. These include
Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl. The
latest addition to its roster, and
available exclusively on Netflix for UK
viewers, is Black Lightning, which
focuses on a New Orleans high school
principal/superhero with the power to
control electricity (we expect his mobile
phone never loses its charge). The show
premieres on Netflix six days after it airs
in the US, with new episodes made
available weekly.
The other shows air on Sky One in the
UK, but viewers without Netflix needn’t
be alarmed because, despite coming
from the same production team, no
crossovers with Black Lightning are
currently planned.
A trailer for the show is available
to watch at bit.ly/black440.
TVPlayer gains a cloud-based
DVR
TVPlayer (tvplayer.com) lets you watch
free-to-air channels, including BBC One,
ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Dave,
on your PC, TV, mobile phone or tablet.
It’s entirely free, but ad-supported.
There’s also a paid-for ad-free version
called TVPlayer Plus, priced from £5.99
a month, which provides access to over
100 channels and up to 38 premium
channels not included on Freeview or
Freesat. TV Player has just introduced
a new DVR service that allows Plus
subscribers to record 10 hours of
programming direct to the cloud. If
that’s not enough, you can expand this
to 150 hours for just £5 extra a month.
Unfortunately, the DVR only works
with paid-for TV channels, although
TVPlayer is planning to add more
channels in the future, depending –
we would imagine – on what demand
for the service is like.
BT and Sky to oﬀer each
other’s programmes
It may have taken a couple of years to
come to an arrangement, but BT has at
last announced it will start selling Sky’s
Now TV service to its customers, giving
them access to some of the satellite
broadcaster’s most popular content,
including Sky Sports, Sky Cinema and
the Sky Atlantic channel. The full Now
TV service will be available on BT TV’s
set-top box, and the telecom giant will
also sell subscriptions to Now TV
passes. In return, BT has agreed to offer
its Sports channels directly to Sky
customers. These include exclusive live
access to UEFA Champions League and
Premier League football.
Don’t get too excited just yet though,
because these new services won’t be
available to customers until early 2019.

Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services
Amazon moves away from new comedy
Amazon has a lot of good, original content but it’s lagging some
way behind Netflix. In a bid to bolster its appeal, the retail giant
has shifted its programming focus to drama – the recently
announced Lord of the Rings TV series being a prime (pun
intended) example. The main casualty of this move seems to
be scripted comedy as, according to entertainment-news sites
Deadline (bit.ly/deadline440), Amazon has decided not to turn any
of its recent comedy pilots into full series. So if you liked Sea Oak
(pictured right, which stars Glenn Close as a woman back from the
dead), Love You More or The Climb, and were looking forward to

news. A pilot is all you’re going to get.

esktop PCs are usually so big you need to keep them in a spare room
tucked under a desk, but it doesn’t have to be this way because
modern PCs come in a wide range of sizes and configurations. In this
Group Test, we’ve focused our attention on petite desktop PCs that take up
very little space.
Included in the test are two full PCs (the Asus VivoMini and the HP Elite
Slice); two ‘barebone’ PCs (the MSI Cubi 3 Silent and the Zotac Magnus
ER51060) that come with no memory, storage or operating system; and a PC
on an HDMI stick (the Intel Compute Stick) that slots straight into the HDMI
port of your monitor or TV. The barebone models won’t work straight out of
the box and you’ll need to purchase and fit the additional hardware – which
was surprisingly easy in both cases – and then install Windows 10.
Most mini PCs only deliver the essential
components – processor, memory and a single
storage drive – while barebone systems start
off with even less, so it’s rare to see a tiny
Windows computer that’s as well-equipped
as the VivoMini.
Here, we’ve reviewed the VM65N-G072Z,
but the VivoMini range has many different
configurations that are worth checking out
if you want to spend less. This model sits
close to the top of the range, with a dual-core
i5-7200U processor, 8GB of memory and both
a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive.
The VivoMini’s specifications aren’t as
impressive as the Silver Award-winning Zotac
Magnus ER51060, but it’s significantly cheaper
and much more compact. It performed
reasonably well, scoring 39 overall in our 4K
benchmark tests, placing it behind the Zotac but
well ahead of the cheaper Cubi 3 Silent. Its
performance in our gaming test was just as
impressive, running Dirt Showdown in 720p
resolution with High graphics settings at 43fps
(frames per second).
The VivoMini has the best storage options of
all the PCs in this test, with the dual drives
offering a perfect balance of speed and capacity.
You can even open it up to access the drives and
upgrade the storage or memory, should you find
yourself running out of either in the future.
Despite the VivoMini’s compact case, Asus has
included a good selection of ports: four USB 3
ports, two USB 3.1 sockets, both HDMI and
DisplayPort (so you could have two monitors
attached) and Gigabit Ethernet. There’s also an
SD card reader and 802.11ac Wi-Fi.
All this means that it’s a bit larger than some of
the other mini PCs we’ve reviewed, but it looks
great and is also light enough to be mounted
onto the back of a monitor if you’d prefer to keep
it hidden from view.

There’s no reason why your next desktop PC needs to take up
loads of room. Here, we’ve reviewed five Windows 10 PCs that
are small enough to hide behind your monitor
HOW WE TESTED
With capable
performance, generous
storage and
extensive
connectivity, this is
an impressively
versatile mini PC.
A reliable contender
for use in a home office,
it’s also one of the few
models we tested to
contain both a main SSD
and a back-up hard drive.
This makes it larger than
some of the other PCs in
this test – there are
sleeker, more stylish
alternatives available –
but the VivoMini makes
use of its extra surface
area by providing plenty
of ports and outputs.

We ran (or attempted to run) our 4K
Windows benchmark on each of the PCs so
we could easily compare their performance
when running a selection of typical
Windows tasks. We also tested them with
our usual Dirt Showdown gaming test,
running the game with its graphical detail
turned up to High, and measuring how many
frames per second (fps) it produced.

Mini PCs Group Test
10 - 23 January 2018 23

Mini PCs don’t come any smaller than
this stick, which is about the size of
a cereal bar. Like a TV streamer, it’s
built onto an HDMI plug, so you can
connect the entire PC straight into
the back of your monitor or TV.
The Compute Stick’s tiny size
means it’s not particularly powerful,
and although there’s a range of different configurations,
the choice of processors is limited. We tested a model with
a dual-core 900MHz Core m3-6Y30 processor, 4GB of
memory and Windows 10 installed, but we couldn’t run our
4K benchmark on it because the device wasn’t able to cope.
The 1080p alternative ran adequately but this is clearly the
worst performing PC in this group. Its gaming performance
isn’t up to par, either, running 720p Dirt Showdown at just
20fps on its High graphics setting.
There isn’t a great deal of storage on Intel’s stick but a
microSD slot means you can expand this. It also has three
USB ports, which isn’t bad for such a tiny computer.
This modular PC is
designed to let you add
different sections (‘slices’),
depending on what
modules you need. Right
now, however, there are
only two modules available
– one of which, a combined
DVD-RW drive and Bang
and Olufsen speaker, was
included with this setup that we’ve reviewed. The other
module is a clip-on mount that lets you hang the PC on the
back of a monitor.
Its quad-core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-6500T processor, 8GB of
memory and 256GB NVMe SSD helped it perform well,
though perhaps not as well as you might hope, given the high
price. It scored 61 overall in our 4K Windows benchmark,
second behind the Zotac Magnus. It also managed 31fps on
our Dirt Showdown test with the graphics set to High, which is
good but still a long way behind Zotac’s PC.
The Zotac Magnus is large
for a mini PC and comes with
no storage (you needs to
install an M.2 SSD), memory
(SO-DIMM RAM) or
operating system – but it’s
a powerful PC with an AMD
Ryzen 5 1400 processor and
Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.
We tested it with the same 4GB of memory that we put in
the Cubi 3 Silent and it performed brilliantly in our 4K
Windows benchmark, topping the group with an overall score
of 85. Dirt Showdown running at 720p resolution and the
graphics set to High produced 133fps, which is 90fps better
than the second best in this test, although pushing it hard
made the noisy fan kick in. Buying Windows and the
components used in this test cost about £200, bringing the
price up to £899. That may sound like a lot but it’s actually
good value for such a great-performing PC.
MSI’s Cubi brand has been a
stalwart of ‘barebone’ PCs,
where you buy the chassis
and processor, then add extra
components according to your
needs and budget. You have to
buy and fit the memory, hard
drive and operating system,
but there’s nothing to be
daunted by because it’s very easy to put together. It could
also save you a lot of money. The 4GB of memory and 128GB
SSD with Windows 10 preinstalled, with which we tested the
MSI, costs £201, making the total of this PC £540,
The case has no fan, which means it’s as silent as the name
suggests, but we found that the case got very hot while
running under the extreme pressure of our benchmarking
tools. This affected its performance, only managing an overall
score of 24 in our 4K Windows benchmark, and a frame rate
of 17fps with High settings on Dirt Showdown at 720p.

The Intel Compute Stick is so tiny that it can’t carry out processor-hungry
Windows tasks, although it manages pretty well with simple ones. It’s
surprisingly cheap, and would work well behind either a TV or a monitor.
For a mini PC, the Zotac Magnus is bulky, and you’ll need to add your own SSD,
memory and operating system. However, whether you’re a gamer or an
all-rounder, you won’t be disappointed with its impressive performance.
The MSI’s low performance score means it’s not ideal for use as a full-on PC, but
its silent operation and excellent selection of ports make it ideal for sitting next
to your TV and streaming video or browsing the web.
This smart-looking modular PC performs well, but not well enough to justify its
price. Its modular concept is a clever idea but there aren’t yet many modules
available. It comes with Windows 10 Pro, which is overkill for most home users.

Group Test Mini PCs
OUR VERDICT
We gave our Gold Award to the Asus VivoMini because
it manages to balance price with performance, and comes
with everything you need preinstalled. It didn’t outperform
the fastest PC in our test but it’s a decent all-round package
that will suit most web users who aren’t fussed about
running the latest games.
If gaming is a requirement for your family PC,
however, the Silver Award-winning Zotac Magnus
ER51060 is worth looking at. You’ll need to spend
another £200 on top of its £699 price to get
this barebone PC working but when you do, its
performance is phenomenal.
If you haven’t got that kind of money to spend, take
a look at our Bronze Award winner, the MSI Cubi 3 Silent.
Its performance is disappointing but not bad for the price,
for which you get a functioning Windows 10 PC that
you can easily hide behind a monitor or TV.

but this file-encryption tool
deserves a special mention
because it costs a wallet-
busting $94 (£70). To be
fair, the makers offer a free
demo version with no time
limit, but if you want all the
features, you need to pay
a small fortune – although,
as the developer helpfully
points out, it’s still “much
cheaper than the cost of
your data”.
We don’t see many fantastic free
real-time strategy (RTS) games like this
these days. You can play in single or
multiplayer mode, taking control of
more than a hundred different units with
unique abilities over hundreds of maps.
The game features an advanced physics
system, and lets you manipulate the
surrounding terrain to create mountains
and valleys. You can even take on your
opponent with an army of robotic fleas!

Beat hackers and crashes
by isolating sites
One is the loneliest number, but when
you’re browsing the web it’s also the
safest, which is why Chrome now offers
a site-isolation option. This experimental
security feature was introduced in
version 63 of the browser and ensures
that the site you’re viewing is rendered
in its own dedicated process, isolated
from other sites. Not only does this
‘boundary’ stop hackers interacting with
and hijacking the site’s content through
third-party domains, but it means that
if the current site crashes, it won’t bring
other tabs or your browser down with it.
To activate the option, type
chrome:flags into the address bar
and press Enter to access Chrome’s
Experiments page. Search for ‘enable-
site-per-process ’ to find the ‘Strict site
isolation’ entry, click Enable and restart
Chrome. Be aware, however, that the
experimental feature may “increase
memory usage by approximately
10–20%”, which is why Google hasn’t
enabled it for all users yet.
There’s a constant flow of content online, which can make it difficult to keep
track of what’s new on your favourite websites. A handy new extension
called SiteDelta Watch (bit.ly/sitedelta440), available for both Chrome and
Firefox, makes life easier by informing you when changes have been made to
pages you’ve chosen to ‘watch’. Click the add-on’s two-triangle toolbar
button while viewing a site and select Enable to start watching it. From then
on, any changes that are made to the
page are highlighted so you can see them
at a glance. Select Configuration to
change the colour of the highlighting,
and to tell the extension which aspects
to ignore and how frequently to check for
changes. SiteDelta Watch presents a list
of all the sites you’re watching, giving
you one-click access, and offers a Scan
All option to check for updates.
Track product prices
on Amazon
Anyone who did their Christmas
shopping through Amazon will have
noticed that prices on the online
store fluctuate constantly – usually
getting cheaper just after you’ve
placed your order! Keepa (keepa
.com) is an invaluable tool for
Chrome and Firefox that ensures you
never miss a bargain again. The tool
lets you track the price of products
over a week, month, three months or
year, so you can see whether they’re
getting cheaper or more expensive.
Once installed, Keepa displays a
price-history graph on each item’s
Amazon page, along with a table
that shows the highest, lowest and
average cost of the item. You can
elect to receive an alert through
email, Facebook, Twitter or Desktop
notifications when the price drops to
a specified amount, and find out
how much your chosen product sells
for – both new and used – on
Amazon Marketplace and eBay.
View summaries of online
articles
If you like to keep abreast of the latest
news, reviews and opinions, but you
don’t have the time or the inclination
to read entire articles from start to
finish, you’ll appreciate a new Chrome
extension called Core Summarizer
(bit.ly/core440). This summarises the
content of the page you’re viewing,
picking out the most important points
and conclusions, while “filtering out
weak arguments, speculation and
asides”. That sounds like quite an
advanced skill for a humble browser
add-on, but we that found that it
worked pretty well, displaying a concise
summary as soon as we clicked its
toolbar button and telling us how many
minutes we’d saved by not reading the
entire piece. Core Summarizer claims to
reduce text by 50 to 80% on average,
“depending on how much valuable
information it contains”.

Block even more unwanted
content using Ghostery 8
It’s nearly a year since Cliqz (cliqz.com)
bought the popular privacy tool Ghostery
(www.ghostery.com), incorporating it into
its own Cliqz browser (see Issue 419, bit.ly/
webuser419). Now Cliqz has updated the
Ghostery add-on for Firefox, Chrome,
Opera, Edge and Safari, to make its content
blocking even more powerful. Ghostery 8’s
features include Enhanced Antitracking
Protection, which detects trackers in
real-time and overwrites any data they
could use to identify you. An Enhanced
Adblocker provides further protection, and
a new Smart Blocking feature automatically blocks and
unblocks trackers to speed up websites while ensuring
pages display correctly. Ghostery’s redesigned interface
is faster and simpler, and gives you greater control over
which elements you block and allow.
If you previously ditched Ghostery for another privacy
tool, this excellent update could tempt you back.
Be more productive by
using tomatoes
If one of your New Year’s resolutions is
to get more done in 2018, help is hand
from an add-on called Tomato Clock
(bit.ly/tomato440). It’s based on a
time-management method called the
Pomodoro Technique (and was
originally named after it until a
“trademark dispute” ensued), which
works by breaking up your activities into
25-minute intervals
called ‘tomatoes’. After
each tomato you take
a short break, or a
longer one after every
four tomatoes. The aim
is to make you more
productive by organising
your day into
manageable chunks. The
extension serves as a
timer for your tomatoes,
and uses a Desktop
notification and sound to
alert you when it’s time
to take your break. Tomato Clock also
provides a graph showing how many
tomatoes you’ve completed over the
past week, so you can see when you
were most and least productive.
Search smarter
using Opera’s VPN
Opera is one of the few
browsers to offer a free, built-in
VPN, but users have reported
problems when searching the
web because the results aren’t
relevant to their location and are
sometimes in the wrong
language. Opera addresses this
problem – which occurs because
the VPN routes your connection
through another country – in
version 50 of the browser. You
can now bypass the VPN while
searching with Google or Bing,
and the VPN is automatically
re-enabled when you click a link
in the search results. To activate
this feature, click the menu
button and go to Settings,
‘Privacy & security’ and select
‘Enable VPN’ and ‘Bypass VPN
for default search engines’.
Switch between
search engines in
Vivaldi
Vivaldi has a useful feature that
makes it easy to switch between
Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo,
StartPage and more, depending
on what you’re looking for and
how private you want to be.
Either click the down arrow
next to the magnifying glass
in the search
box and
choose a
different
engine, or
use a shortcut
before your
search term,
such as g
something to
search Google or
w something to search
Wikipedia. You can view and
change these shortcuts in the
search-engine list.

View a mini map of long
web pages
Some web pages seem to go on
forever – we’re looking at you, Mail
Online homepage – which can make
browsing them both time-consuming
and tough on your scrolling finger.
Minimap Scroller (bit.ly/minimap440)
is a handy new Firefox add-on that
solves this problem by adding a
miniature map of a page’s layout in a
sidebar on the left-hand side of your
browser window. This helps you
navigate the page quickly, so you can
jump straight to specific sections
without having to keep scrolling.
The extension works on all websites
excluding the official Firefox Add-ons
site, although the developer warns
that you may experience a few
bugs because the add-on is still
‘experimental’.

Shazam

The future of this brilliant
music-recognition app
seemed a little uncertain
when, at the tail end of
2017, Apple announced
that it had snapped up the
British firm behind it for a
rumoured £300m. It’s
probably not hard to
guess what the Cupertino
company has in mind for
Shazam’s technology. It’s
already built into iOS to
some extent in the form of Siri’s music-recognition
abilities. But owning Shazam outright could pave the way
for even deeper integration with Apple’s software,
potentially allowing for the type of always-on music
recognition that Google’s Pixel smartphone offers, as well
as providing the opportunity to incorporate song
identification into the Apple Music streaming service.
Either way, it would be easy to assume that Apple’s
acquisition might spell doom for Shazam’s standalone apps
– especially the Android version. The fact that the app has
been updated on both platforms seems to suggest that this
isn’t the case, however – at least in the short term.
The iOS version of Shazam has gained a handy new
offline mode, which lets you identify songs even when you
don’t have access to Wi-Fi or
a mobile data connection.
It works by caching the song
data until a connection is
available, then matching it when
you’re back online.
Offline ‘Shazamming’ has
been available in the Android
version of the app for a while,
but that doesn’t mean users of
non-Apple phones have been
left with nothing new. A recent
update to the Android version
of Shazam not only reduced
the size of the app
by 10MB but added an Auto
Shazam mode (also available
in the iOS version), which
automatically
identifies
songs that play
around you.

photo tool
(although not

them into fun,

with music, transitions and effects.
It’s easy to use: just select your shots,

Chrome extension,
which checks for and corrects
grammatical mistakes in blog posts,
social media updates and more. This
keyboard tool for iOS and Android
takes the concept a step further by
applying the laws of grammar to your
every smartphone or tablet keystroke.
Grammarly Keyboard is almost brilliant,
but it’s not quite there yet, with few
customisation options and
the occasional glitch,
especially in the iOS app.
Hopefully, these will be
fixed in future updates.

‘appsperiments’
(apps based on
technologies that
are under active research at the
company). Selfissimo is one of
these – a selfie tool that takes a series
of arty black-and-white shots
of you automatically when you strike
a pose, and arranges them into a
contact sheet. You can share this or
save individual shots, but that’s pretty
much all the app does.
Selfissimo is a cool tool,
especially for selfie
addicts, but it lacks any
real depth.

Another of
Google’s recent
quirky app
releases, Scrubbies
is an iOS-only tool that lets you
manipulate the speed and direction
of video clips to produce slow-mo,
speeded-up or reversed mini clips.
Tap the camera icon to record a clip,
then use one finger to scrub through
your recording to find a bit you want
to use. Then use two-fingered
gestures to direct the action, swiping
backwards or forwards, slowly or
quickly to achieve the desired effect.
Your finished results can be saved or
shared. It’s a pity you can’t import existing
videos from your library, though, and the
process of creating a cool-looking clip can be
somewhat hit and miss.

Storyboard
bit.ly/storyboard440

The final app in
Google’s trilogy
of recent oddball
experiments is
designed to take
any videos you’ve
recorded and convert
them into a kind of
comic strip, applying
hand-drawn effects
and arranging selected
frames in a layout that
mimics the panels of a
comic page. Currently,
there aren’t many options for controlling the app’s output.
Once you’ve loaded a video, you can swipe through various
layouts that use different types of effect until
you find one you want to keep. You can save any
layouts you like or share them over social media.
Like Selfissimo and Scrubbies, Storyboard is
currently quite basic, but fun.

The purr-fect game or an ridiculous waste of money? David Crookes
examines the latest craze of collectible digital cats
Our guide to CryptoKitties
What are they?
CryptoKitties is a new i
centred around everyo
f
online creature: cats. It
ol e
collecting, trading and b
d
g
l
kittens using a blockch
k
But while some people
j y
g h
trading game purely a
f
others are making seri
y.
How does it work?
The game is built on th
h
blockchain, which is a
h d
f d g
l
bookkeeping that chai
g
h
continuously growing l
f
in secure batches of d
k o
blocks (you can read more about this in
our FAQ on Blockchain in issue 435).
At the simplest level, players buy a kitten
using a cryptocurrency called ‘Ether’,
in much the same way as you’d buy a
physical toy using cash. The CryptoKitty
then belongs to the purchaser. The fact
that each cat is unique means many of
them are becoming highly prized.
Where does the gaming element
come from?
There are two key parts to CryptoKitties.
The first is that the kittens can be sold to
other collectors via a button on their
profile that allows the virtual animals to
be put up for sale. But the second – and
most intriguing – aspect of this
increasingly popular craze is that two
CryptoKitties can be bred to produce
another unique kitten. It is why the
developers AxionZen are describing their
game as “breedable Beanie Babies”
(see box on opposite page).
So how do I get a CryptoKitty?
To play CryptoKitties, you have to install
the MetaMask digital wallet (metamask
.io), which is only available as an
extension in the desktop versions of
Chrome and Firefox. You then need
to buy Ether (or ETH as it’s known)
from an exchange such as Coinbase
(www.coinbase.com) and transfer it to
MetaMask. Once that’s done, you simply
visit the CryptoKitties website (www
.cryptokitties.co) and create an account.
CryptoKitties are available in the
marketplace in exchange for Ether.
How much do they cost
Well, that’s the $64,000 question –
literally, as we’ll see. At the time of
writing, according to the Kitty Sales
website (kittysales.co), the average mid-
range price was $23.29, but that hasn’t
deterred fans from buying more than
61,555 unique kittens.
Prices are set by users and drop over
24 hours until the auction ends or the
kittens are snapped up. At the same time,
new CryptoKitties are released every
15 minutes and their prices are
determined by the average price of the
last five kittens sold plus an extra 50%.
Wow! So they’re not cheap?
Not at all. Again, the Kitty Sales website
shows the top price paid for a CryptoKitty
(as of 8 December) as an eye-watering
$113,749, which translates to 253 Ether
(or £84,485). Total sales of all
CryptoKitties so far amount to about
£10m, which is quite an achievement
when you consider that the game
Cryptokitties are cute, colourful and highly
collectible – for a price

10 - 23 January 2018 39
Discuss CryptoKitties at forum.webuser.co.uk
CryptoKitties
only officially came into being on
28 November 2017.
What if someone steals a kitten?
Ah, that’s the good thing about
CryptoKitties’ use of blockchain. The
technology is tamper-proof, which means
that kittens cannot be captured,
destroyed or replicated. The blockchain
securely tracks each kitten’s ownership
so when you buy a kitten, the transaction
is added to the blockchain and creates
a permanent online receipt.
If you buy a CryptoKitten, then you
own it and look after it forever (although
in all honesty, they don’t need much
looking after: they don’t eat, defecate or
show any emotion). There’s no chance
that the kittens can be deleted if the
company decides to shut down.
What happens when the kittens
breed, though?
Well, this is the interesting bit, although
it needs some background explanation.
When the game launched, it did so with
100 Founder Kitties that are referred to
as Gen-Zero. More of these Gen-Zero
kittens are released every 15 minutes but
there is a limit to how many can be
created. Indeed CryptoKitties is limiting
them to 50,000. They will finish
generating by November 2018, which
ensures a level of scarcity.
So how have more than 50,000
kittens been bought?
That’s where breeding comes in. As you’d
expect, you need two CrypoKitties to do
this and because they are gender-fluid,
you don’t need to worry about putting
a Dame and Sire together – each
CryptoKitty can play either role. Once
you’ve selected which is going to be the
mum and which the dad, you just wait for
virtual nature to take its course. After a
short while, two Gen-Zero kittens will
spawn a Gen-One offspring while a Gen-
One and Gen-Five kitty, for example,
would produce a Gen-Six. This goes on
and on, producing ever more kitties.
So there’s lots more cash to be
made, then?
To a degree. CryptoKitties with lower
generation numbers are worth more than
those with higher ones, and the trick is to
get lucky and breed a kitten with rare
traits. But since each creature has a
unique 256-bit genome and there are
four billion possible genetic variations,
this isn’t as straightforward as it sounds.
The traits of a CryptoKitty – such as facial
features, colour, whiskers, markings and
cooldown time – are decided by an
algorithm that the developer is keeping
close to its chest.
Which ones should I look for?
The most highly prized are called Oldlace
but there are only five of those in
existence right now according to
CryptoKittyDex (cryptokittydex.com/
cattributes). Wolfgrey kitties are also rare
and valuable: there are just 31 of those. If
you end up with Totesbasic, though,
you’re going to be less fortunate since
there are 68,486 of them – and counting.
It sounds complicated. Is it really
worth it?
It does, on the face of it, sound as if the
world has finally lost its mind, but some
people are making serious money out of
CryptoKitties. They are so popular that
the game now accounts for more than
15% of network traffic on Ethereum
(which has consequently raised the price
of joining the game). Rival games such as
CryptoPets (www.cryptopets.co) have
already appeared online, so this could go
either way: people may get fed up with
the whole thing very quickly or they may
hop from one trend to another to make
a quick buck.
Surely the developer must be
making money?
It sure is. AxionZen takes a 3.75% fee of
all auction and siring transactions via its
website. Given the soaring price of the
CryptoKitties, it’s bound to be amassing
a pretty penny.
Although CryptoKitties’ developer describes its game as
“breedable Beanie Babies”, it would do well to heed the
lessons of this once phenomenally popular toy range.
Huge in the 1990s, Beanie Babies at one time accounted
for 10% of eBay’s sales and made a lot of people a lot of
money. This was helped by the makers creating scarcity
in the market by retiring certain Babies on a whim, thus
driving up the prices. But eventually, the novelty wore
off – when retirements were announced in January 1999,
prices remained stable and a flurry of new releases
failed to generate interest. By 2000, the Beanie Babies
bubble had burst. Still, as we explain above,
CryptKitties’ developer currently earns commission on
every purchase, so it probably isn’t panicking just yet.
CryptoKitties aren’t cheap to start with and
their price is rapidly soaring

Should you change to a new web browser in 2018 or
stick with what you’re using? Robert Irvine compares
the 10 best options to discover what they have to offer
COVER

S
ome people don’t give much thought to which browser they use – they
just pick one and stay with it (or use the default on their device). After
all, what does it matter as long as it gets you online? But we know that
Web User readers are a more discerning and adventurous bunch, not afraid
to try new software and eager to get the optimum online experience.
So, to kick off the new year, we’re taking a closer look at this most essential
of programs. Chrome may seem like the obvious champion, but is
it necessarily the perfect browser for your needs? Just look at
how Firefox has risen again from the ashes – more than
170 million people have already installed its revamped
Quantum version – while innovative new browsers
such as Vivaldi and Brave are delighting savvy web
users with their smart built-in tools.
In this feature, we look at 10 leading contenders
and examine what they offer in features,
customisation options, ease of use
and performance. We’ve focused on
Windows browsers (with apologies
to Safari fans) and are happy to hear
if you disagree with our choices.

Most browsers support keyboard
shortcuts but Vivaldi goes a step further
by letting you create your own, and you
can easily add more search engines to
its default options. It also gives you
impressive control over your privacy
settings and lets you clear all your

private data in one go. In our speed test,
it came a close second to Chrome for
page-loading times and feels smooth
and stable as you browse.
Vivaldi doesn’t yet have its own
extensions site – you have to use the
Chrome Web Store, which is confusing
because the buttons are still labelled
‘Add to Chrome’. But all the add-ons we
tried worked perfectly in Vivaldi and
make it much less restrictive than Brave
or Epic (see pages 43 and 44), though it
lacks their built-in security tools.
We’d like to see syncing options and
a version of Vivaldi for mobile devices
– both are apparently ‘in the works’ –
and fewer entries preinstalled in the
browser’s Bookmarks. Commendably,
Vivaldi actively seeks feedback about
bugs so it can fix them as quickly
as possible.
It was a close race for the top spot in
this round-up, but in the end we gave it
to bright new hope Vivaldi. Whereas
most browsers now ape the pared-
down design of Chrome, Vivaldi most
resembles older versions of Opera,
which isn’t surprising since it was
created by Opera’s co-founder to be
“Opera as it should’ve been” (before it
became more Chrome-like). But that
doesn’t mean the browser is derivative
or old-fashioned – quite the opposite
– in fact, Vivaldi is the most original and
progressive browser around.
Its default interface may not look
particularly groundbreaking, but dig
deeper and you’ll discover all manner of
clever features, customisation options
and time-saving tricks, which are
frequently updated and refined, and
reported in the friendly Vivaldi blog
(vivaldi.com/blog).
When you first run Vivaldi, you’re
invited to choose from six attractive
themes, set the position of your tab bar
and pick a background wallpaper. Web

Simplicity is the great strength of our
Silver Award winner: rather than
overload its browser with features,
Google lets you choose what to install
from the vast Chrome Web Store of
extensions and themes (chrome.google
.com/webstore). The sheer variety is
astounding, although Chrome’s reliance
on third-party tools has made the
browser itself less innovative in recent
years, especially since switching to a
‘rapid release cycle’ that means new

Chrome’s huge choice of extensions is one of the best
reasons to use the browser
Chrome’s excessive memory usage can
cause the browser to hang or crash
Chrome’s support for the latest
web technologies places it at the
cutting edge, even if other
browsers offer more features
If you’re put off by Chrome’s
privacy and memory issues and
aren’t impressed by the new
features in Firefox Quantum, Opera
won’t let you down and may even
take you by surprise.
F
This ‘if ain’t broke, don’t fix it’
approach can make Chrome seem
unadventurous when compared to our
Gold Award winner but, in its favour,
Chrome has many useful built-in tools
that work unobtrusively, including a
form filler, spellchecker and password
manager, and Google features such as
Translate and voice control.
Aside from extensions, Chrome
thrives on three S’s: search, sync and
security. Being able to search Google
from your address bar and easily sync
all your bookmarks, history,
passwords, tabs and other
data across all your devices is
incredibly useful, and we like
that the browser now warns
you about dubious sites,
add-ons that make changes
to your settings and
potentially harmful software.
A fourth S – speed – is also a
given, with Chrome narrowly
beating Vivaldi to the top
spot in our performance test.
Chrome’s biggest flaw is
that it voraciously devours
memory. Because it uses a separate
background process for every tab,
plugin and extension, this soon adds up
and can lead to pages hanging and
crashing. Add-ons are often the biggest
hogs, but it still makes Chrome less
stable than other browsers.
FE
Opera has been around for 22 years but
it’s never claimed more than a 6% share
of the browser market and remains
relatively unsung beyond all but the
savviest web users. This is a travesty
because Opera has introduced more
innovations than any other browser and
its latest, 50th version offers such useful
features as a built-in ad blocker,
a screenshot tool, a sidebar for chatting
to friends in WhatsApp and Facebook
Messenger, a power-saving mode for
laptop users and a pop-out video player.
Best of all is the free VPN, which
spoofs your IP address and encrypts
your data to keep you safe and
anonymous online. No other browser
has this excellent feature, which is easily
turned on and off via a tick box
in Opera’s settings – even the
privacy-focused Brave and Epic
rely on proxy servers rather
than VPNs.
Opera came third in our
speed test and uses much less
memory than the two market
leaders, Chrome and Firefox.
You may occasionally
encounter sites that aren’t
designed for Opera and don’t
display properly, but this
problem can usually be fixed
with an add-on. Indeed, since Firefox
switched to WebExtensions, Opera is
second only to Chrome in its choice of
add-ons. Technically, since you can
install Chrome extensions (bit.ly/
install440), it’s actually in first place.
Opera can seem confusing at first
because some of its best features are
tucked away, and its interface feels
slightly dated. However, the promise of
Opera Neon – heralded as the “future of
web browsers” – shows that it’s not
resting on its laurels.
Opera offers many features other browsers don’t,
including a free built-in VPN

Maxthon Cloud Browser’s homepage
boasts of 670 million users, yet most
people have never heard of it – which is
a shame because Maxthon is packed
with innovative features you won’t find

– and is available

If you ditched Firefox for Chrome

give Quantum a try, if only to see
what’s different.
If you don’t mind trading flexibility

great choice and very easy to use.

customisable skins; and optional extras
such as a password manager, note-

Maxthon’s main flaw is that it tries to
cram in too much, so its interface lacks
the simplicity of Vivaldi,
Chrome and Firefox,
particularly when you
delve into its menus
and settings.
This surfeit of features
makes the browser slower
to start and load pages
Statistics for content blocked by the
browser are displayed on your New Tab
page, along with photos, the current
time and shortcuts to your favourite
sites, and Brave also ranked respectably
in our performance test. It’s very easy to
use, with a streamlined design and the
useful option to preview a
tab’s content.
Instead of add-ons, Brave
has nine preselected tools,
including a torrent client,
discount-finder Honey and
(rather unnecessarily) four
different password
managers. It’s a pity Brave

made to ensure the tab you’re currently
viewing is given priority over
background tabs, and to deliver
smoother video playback.
Firefox now has a built-in screenshot
tool, a handy sidebar displaying your
Bookmarks, History and Synced Tabs,
and a unified address and search bar.
Although not as instantly customisable
as Vivaldi, it lets you personalise
your New Tab page and, of
course, install thousands of extra
tools from its Add-ons site
(addons.mozilla.org). These

Pale Moon’s main shortcoming
concerns add-ons. Mozilla’s switch to

that thousands of
classic Firefox add-ons

perhaps the most
notable example. Pale

content, a read-it-later list for saving
interesting articles and the option to

Then, of course, there’s integration with
Windows 10 voice-assistant Cortana,
which either makes your browsing easier
or gets turned off almost immediately.
In its first year, Edge was hampered
by a lack of extensions, though this also
meant fewer security and performance
problems. There are now around
80 useful free tools including ad

protectors and shopping assistants.
Edge has yet to get an essential

third-party cookies and ads; redirecting
your searches through a proxy server
so no one can see what you’re looking

connection (where possible) when you
visit websites; and automatically
clearing your browsing data at the end
of each session. You can also hide your
IP address with a single click, so no one
can tell where you’re browsing from.
Aside from its rather dull design,
the drawback to Epic’s ultra-vigilant
approach is that you’re limited to seven
‘secure’ add-ons, including LastPass,
Pocket and Xmarks, and can’t install
your favourite extensions. Also, because

reduced the choice. However, the lead
developer behind Pale Moon hopes to
address this problem with a new build of
the browser later this year, so you may
want to wait before switching.
Edge’s interface is pleasantly minimal,
with page previews that appear when
you hover over a tab, but there are a few
odd omissions. For example, you can’t
press F11 to go full-screen, search your
history for a specific site or save a page
as HTML. We also found it very slow

on a Windows 10 laptop!
Epic automatically erases your browsing

Tor Browser’s biggest benefit is the
reliable protection it offers against
hackers, identity thieves and nosy
parkers, including government
agencies. Tor comes with two powerful
security tools preinstalled – NoScript

your web traffic through a series
of ‘nodes’ (other
computers) to
conceal your real
IP address and
location. It’s

instantly familiar if you’ve ever used
Mozilla’s browser. Its default search
engine is the privacy-focused
DuckDuckGo, which prevents your
searches from being tracked, stored
and targeted with ads.
On the downside, Tor is noticeably
slower than other browsers if you have
all its security settings
whacked up to the
max, because of the
roundabout way in
which it connects you
to the web. However,
these settings are easy
to disable on sites that
don’t pose a threat,
either temporarily or
by ‘whitelisting’ the relevant URLs.
Some people worry that using Tor will
expose them to the horrors and dangers
of the so-called Dark Web, but this isn’t
the case at all. Sites that can only be
accessed through Tor have convoluted
‘.onion’ addresses that you won’t
accidentally stumble across, although
you should be as vigilant as usual about
opening suspicious links.
It was a tight
race between
Chrome and
Vivaldi, which
are both fast and
highly
customisable, but we eventually
chose innovation over ubiquity to
give the newer browser our Gold
Award. Although Vivaldi still lacks
a mobile version and syncing
options, it feels more modern than
Google’s browser and is stronger
on privacy. Opera and Firefox
Quantum also impressed us,
as did the security-focused Brave.

it still has some way to go to take

As soon as you’ve installed
StartIsBack, you’re
prompted to ‘Configure
StartIsBack now’ – click
this and you can choose
ne of the program’s Start
menu, taskbar and Start
button styles. The default option looks
and works just like Windows 7’s Start
menu, complete with links to the
Control Panel, This PC and the Run tool.
Your user library folders appear on the
right, and there’s a pane where you can
pin your favourite programs and apps
on the left.
If, at any time, you want to view the
standard Windows 10 Start menu, press
Ctrl+Win to reveal it. The right-click Start
menu remains the same, except that
selecting Properties provides access to
StartIsBack’s configuration menu, where
most of its features and functions can be
tweaked and customised to your liking.
For example, if you’ve no desire to
use Windows 10’s built-in apps, you can
click the Start Menu tab on the left, then
untick ‘Display Modern apps’ and
‘Display frequently used Modern apps’
to banish them from your Start menu.
Alternatively, you can alter the
appearance of Windows 10’s tiles
(click Switching, then ‘Tweak modern
icons’) so
that they
look more
like classic
icons.

an unresponsive process from
a Jumplist without having to open

How it can be improved:
Unlike ClassicShell, StartIsBack is not
free, though there is a free trial you can
install before you commit to payment.
That said, £2.23 is a small price to pay
for such a brilliant tool. We don’t have
many other gripes with StartIsBack,
though the configuration tool could
do with a facelift – it looks a bit plain
and some of its best options can be
difficult to find.
OUR VERDICT
With its instantly familiar look and

What we liked:
Start10 is one of
Stardock’s many
Windows customisation
tools, along with Fences
(for managing your
esktop icons) and Groupy
(organises multiple applications
into grouped tabs). You can choose
from three main Start menu styles –
Windows 7, Modern and Windows 10 –
all of which can be modified using
themes and tweaks to individual
settings. The program’s default setting
does a good job of emulating Windows
7’s Start menu, but it’s worth
experimenting with the options to get
things how you like them. Right-click
the Start button and select Configure
Start10 for a tabbed menu of options.
As with StartIsBack, you can change
not only how the Start menu looks and
works but also customise related
controls, assigning actions to Windows
button key combinations and the power
button. There are also some useful
options for tweaking the look of the
taskbar and Desktop.
What we liked:
If you choose the default
Start Menu X style, you

like – it doesn’t have to
main stuck in the bottom-
left corner. Click Start, Options,
then Options again for Start Menu X’s
configuration settings. Under
Personalization, there’s a useful option
to alter the scale – increasing this
setting makes the menu easier to read.
You can add programs and apps to
groups: System, Games, Office and so
on. Their shortcuts appear at the top of
the all-programs list – just click Manage
Virtual Groups in the Personalization
options to customise them.
The program’s keyboard shortcuts
speed up tasks such as shutting down
your PC, and are listed under Shortcuts
in the Options dashboard. Once you’ve
got Start Menu X the way you like it,
you can export your settings (under
‘Advanced options’) to back them up or
import them on another PC.
How it can be improved:
Compared to the smart ‘classic’ look of
our Gold and Silver winners, Smart Menu
X’s design looks dated. Some features –
notably support for tabs and single-click
program launching – aren’t in the free
version and, at £7.99, the Pro version
is expensive compared to its rivals.
How it can be improved:
Some of Start10’s alternative icons –
including its selection of Start buttons –
won’t be to everyone’s taste, and despite
costing more than StartIsBack, it has
fewer useful configuration options.
Also, Start10’s default setting
completely disables Windows 10’s
handy right-click Start menu, and
there’s no obvious way to get it back.
OUR VERDICT
Not quite as polished or useful as
StartIsBack, Start10 nevertheless
nails that Windows 7 Start menu
look and feel, and there’s a decent
selection of customisation options.
OUR VERDICT
This isn’t the best looking Start
menu replacement, but there’s
a free version and it offers some
useful options and shortcuts. We
particularly like its ability to place
the Start menu wherever you like.
Start Menu Reviver | Free
bit.ly/revi440
This free tool gives your Start menu
a whole new look and has been
developed with touchscreens in
mind, which makes it a good choice
for Windows 10 tablets and hybrids.
However, there
aren’t many
configuration
options and, while
it seems to be still
in active
development,
Start Menu Reviver
hasn’t been
updated since 2016, which could
mean that ReviverSoft is neglecting
its software.
IOBit Start Menu 8 | From free
bit.ly/iosm440
Like many Start menu
replacements, this tool was initially
developed as an alternative to the
dreaded Windows 8 Start screen.
Start Menu 8 borrows heavily from
Windows 7’s look and feel, while
offering a handful of customisation
options. It’s still in active
development – a new version was
released just recently – but it
currently costs about £10 to
activate the full version.
ClassicShell | Free
www.classicshell.net
Although the developer of the best
free Start menu replacement tool
has called it a day, it’s still available
to download.
At some point
soon, though,
ClassicShell will
become unsafe
and potentially
unreliable
in the wake
of continuing
Windows 10
updates. The software is now
officially open source (bit.ly/
csos440), so we’re hoping that
someone else will pick up the
mantle and continue development.

Thinkbroadband compares your speed to
other customers in your area
SamKnows provides information about
your nearest broadband exchange
Find out whether your ISP is slowing your
binge-watching of Netflix shows
48 10 - 23 January 2018
Are you getting the
speed you pay for?
It’s very rare to experience the maximum
download speed promised by your ISP
– hence Ofcom’s proposal for providers
to quote a “minimum guaranteed” figure
to prospective customers (bit.ly/
ofcom440) – but your connection may
be significantly slower than what you
pay for. There are loads of free online
tools that measure your broadband
speed, but for accurate results you need
one that uses a local server.
The best-known is Ookla Speedtest
.net (beta.speedtest.net), which is
available in your browser, on your
Desktop and on your phone, and quickly
measures your download and upload
speeds, and ‘ping’ – the time it takes to
send a single packet of data to a server,
and get a single packet back in reply.
It’s worth trying the test at different
times of day for an overview and getting
a second opinion from Thinkbroadband
(bit.ly/think440). This asks you to
specify your postcode and ISP before
running its test, then compares your
results with other customers. If you’re
way off your promised speed, then it’s
time to give your provider a call.
Is your ISP throttling
your bandwidth?
Some of the problems that result in
frustratingly slow broadband, such as
faults caused by rats gnawing through
cables, are beyond your provider’s
control and thus forgivable – provided
they’re fixed quickly and compensated
adequately. But an ISP that deliberately
‘throttles’ your connection without
explanation is being both devious and
dishonest, and should be exposed.
Some providers only slow certain
types of traffic, such as BitTorrent
downloads, while others throttle
customers’ connections if they
download too much data in a month.
In some cases, ISPs are merely trying
to manage network congestion.
Throttling is a particular problem in the
US at the moment, and has sparked
a debate about net neutrality.
A site called Battle for the Net (bit.ly/
speed440) runs a series of speed tests
to detect inconsistencies in the
performance you’re receiving when
connecting to different parts of the net,
although this isn’t necessarily proof of
throttling. You can also try Netflix’s
Internet Speed Test (fast.com) to see
Is your broadband suspiciously slow and ridiculously expensive?
Robert Irvine answers the seven vital questions you need to ask
if your connection to the streaming
service is noticeably slower than your
general speed.
Not all UK ISPs shape traffic, or at
least not any more. See Choose’s
breakdown of ‘Broadband fair use
policies’ (bit.ly/fairuse440) for more
information.
Are you too far from the
broadband exchange?
Historically, households with very slow
connections were those furthest from
their local broadband exchange,
although the rollout of fibre-optic
cables has vastly improved the situation.
Still, if your speed is consistently
sluggish, it’s useful to know how far
away you are from your exchange – or
your fibre broadband cabinet. Enter
your postcode in SamKnows’ Exchange
Search (bit.ly/samknows440) to view
the name of your local exchange, then
click it for detailed information including
a map, the type of broadband it delivers
and the number of premises it serves –
both residential and business.
If your nearest exchange doesn’t offer
superfast fibre broadband, you can find

one that does by using Think
Broadband’s excellent Availability
Checker (bit.ly/thinkbroad440). This
lists your five closest exchanges and
tells you the ISPs that use them and
whether fibre is enabled, to help you
decide who to switch to.
To find a local BT fibre cabinet, enter
your phone number in the BT Wholesale
ADSL Checker (bit.ly/cabinet440). This
will give the number of your cabinet,
so you can look for it while out and
about or on Google Street View.
Is your mobile coverage
as good as claimed?
All mobile networks provide maps on
their websites that show you their 3G
and 4G coverage across the UK, but it’s
best not to take them at face value. EE’s
Coverage Checker (bit.ly/eecov440),
for example, includes the caveats:
“This map is not a guarantee of service
availability in a particular location”,
and “results are based on computer
prediction”, which might explain why
your 4G is slower than it should be.
It’s worth checking if there are filters
to give you a more accurate depiction of
signal strength than the solid block of
colour most networks initially display.
For example, Three’s map (bit.ly/
threecov440) lets you specify your
phone model to view probable coverage
for that device, while O2 (bit.ly/
o2cov440) lets you see the exact
location of phone masts.
For a more impartial overview of
mobile availability in your area, try
Ofcom’s ‘Mobile and broadband
checker’ (checker.ofcom.org.uk). Enter
a postcode to view a map of EE, O2,
Three or Vodafone coverage, indoors
and out. Ofcom’s colour-coding shows
where you’re likely and unlikely to have
reliable coverage for 3G, 4G and voice
calls, based on its own field tests as well
as the networks’ signal predictions.
The map is updated every month, but
Ofcom points out that there are many
factors that affect mobile speed,
including network congestion, buildings,
trees and even weather conditions.
Are you receiving poor
customer service?
From unreliable connections to
unhelpful support, there are many ways
that ISPs disappoint their customers.
Fortunately, there are bodies that
monitor provider performance, of which
the two most notable are the official
communications regulator Ofcom and
consumer watchdog Which.
Ofcom’s most recent broadband
survey, published in April, covered data
from 2016, so it’s a bit out of date but
useful nonetheless (www.ofcom.org.uk/
servicequality). It found that Virgin
Media offered the fastest speeds and
the highest level of customer
satisfaction (91%), while TalkTalk came
bottom (71%). TalkTalk also fared badly
when dealing with customer complaints,
although it did answer calls in a mere 47
seconds. In contrast, Plusnet customers
were kept waiting for an average seven
minutes and 27 seconds, but it’s since
hired more staff to tackle the problem.
Which published its biannual
broadband survey in September (bit.ly/
whichbest440), after speaking to more
than 1,700 customers. It rated TalkTalk
worst for overall customer satisfaction
(40%) and Zen Internet best (85%), with
the main complaint being “very slow”
broadband speeds.
Although such surveys may not
reflect your own experience, they’re
certainly worth perusing if you’re
thinking of switching.
£
Could you get a better
broadband deal?
BT and Virgin Media both recently
increased their broadband prices, by up
to £36 a year for some packages, leaving
many customers wondering if they
should move to another provider. You
can only cancel your contract without
penalty if you do so within 30 days of
being notified of the price rise, and that
deadline has now passed so your best
bet is to haggle for a better deal.
MoneySavingExpert.com provides
useful advice for negotiating with BT,
Virgin Media, Sky, Plusnet and TalkTalk
on its ‘Haggle with service providers’
page (bit.ly/haggle440). Tips include
ensuring you get through to the
customer-retention department (BT’s is
on 0800 800 150), never accepting the
first offer you’re made and asking for
extras, such as free calls, to be thrown in.
If none of MSE’s tips work, it may be
time to move on. There’s no shortage of
broadband-comparison tools online, but
some have been accused of hiding the
best deals from customers. You can
certainly trust Broadband Genie (www
.broadbandgenie.co.uk), which provides
our Broadband Table every issue and is
completely impartial.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether the source
of your broadband problems is at your end or
your ISP’s, which is why internet-performance
specialist SamKnows has come up with the
Whitebox. This purpose-built sensor promises
to tell you “what’s really going on with your
connection”, by giving your broadband a full
examination. It monitors and measures your
download and upload speeds, data-packet
loss, internet-call and streaming quality, and other criteria, then presents that
data in an easy-to-understand dashboard on your Desktop or phone. This
helps you diagnose problems and even provides a monthly health check.

Record voice
calls on your PC
A few years ago, VoIP (Voice
over Internet Protocol) was
hugely popular for making
phone calls from your PC,
but its appeal has dwindled
now that it’s easier to make
free Skype and WhatsApp calls on your
mobile phone. But if you still call people
from your PC, you can record the audio
in various ways, and one of the easiest
is to use the brilliant free program
Audacity (audacityteam.org).
To set it up, click the Audio Host
drop-down menu in the top-left corner
and change MME to WASAPI. Select
your speakers and microphone, making
sure the box on the right is set to stereo,
and you can then place your VoIP call
and click the red Record button to
begin recording. Click Stop when you’ve
finished. You can then play back the
recording, and trim, edit and save it.
Record your Skype calls
Skype doesn’t come with any
built-in tools for recording your phone
calls, whether you use it on your
computer or your mobile device, but
that doesn’t mean you can’t capture
your Skype conversations. There are
plenty of third-party programs available
for Windows, Mac and Linux that can
perform this task, and Microsoft (which

target frame rate and video bitrate.
Click Record Now and resize the red
border so it covers the chat window you
want to record. Then you can click the
Rec button to start recording and the
Stop button when you’ve finished.
Recordings are saved as MP4 files so
you can watch them in any media player.

If you only want to record audio calls,
MP3 Skype Recorder for Windows
(voipcallrecording.com) is a good
option. This free program lets you
record from both the Desktop version
of Skype and the Windows 10 app. It
doesn’t impose any limits on recording
time for private, non-commercial use.
A professional edition is also available,
which adds a couple of extra features
and costs £8 for a one-PC licence,
but you probably won’t need this.

Record your voice
and video calls
Want to record a conversation for personal or legal
reasons? Wayne Williams reveals the best tools
available for capturing your calls on PC and mobile

costs £35 for an hour, £175 for five hours
and £350 for 10 hours.
The free version of the app limits
you to 20 minutes of recording time
a month, which is plenty if you only
need to record the occasional short call.
You can buy more time if you need it:
for £6 a month, you can make unlimited
recordings. The app’s usage section
shows how much monthly free
recording and paid transcription time
you have left.
Capture calls
using TapeACall
If you need to record a lot of phone
conversations, TapeACall (www
.tapeacall.com) is worth looking into.
Available for Android and iOS, it works
by setting up a three-way call. To use it,
simply open the TapeACall app and tap
the big Record button. The app dials
TapeACall and starts recording as soon
as the service picks up. It can handle
incoming and outgoing calls, and you
can start a recording halfway through
a conversation.
You can even
share your
recordings
(although not
publicly
without
permission
– see box
below) and
download
them in MP3
format to
listen to them
anywhere.
TapeACall
is a useful
service, but
it has some
disadvantages that you should be aware
of. First, it’s not free – you have to sign
up for a £3.49 monthly subscription.
What’s more, your mobile phone
such as the
ability to group
saved
recordings by
date, and the
option to delete
old recordings
automatically
(unless you’ve
marked them as
important). You
can password-
protect sensitive
chats and delay
recordings.
Upgrading to
the premium
version for
£2.49 removes
the adverts and
introduces
additional features, such as integration
with Dropbox and Google Drive, so you
can save your recordings to the cloud.
Record iPhone calls
for free
To record calls on your iPhone, try Call
Recording by NoNotes (bit.ly/
nonotes440).
This free app
records
incoming and
outgoing calls
and saves them
in the cloud. You
can share your
recordings by
email or on
Facebook,
and even send
files to be
transcribed,
which is handy
if you want a
written version
of your
conversation.
Transcription
provider must support three-way calling
for it to work. Vodafone does but EE
and Orange UK don’t, so check with
your provider before you fork out.
Record live video
in iOS 11
One of the best new features in iOS 11
is the ability to record videos of your
screen. You can use this to capture
video chats on your iPhone or iPad.
It works with any program, including
WhatsApp, although it has one major
limitation, which is that once the call
starts, the audio is muted. If you only
want to capture a video and sound isn’t
important (perhaps because the person
you’re calling is showing you something)
this might come in handy, especially as
it takes seconds to set up.
For easy access to the built-in screen
recorder, open Settings and go to
Control Centre. Tap Customise Controls,
then scroll down the list and tap the
green plus
sign next to
Screen
Recording.
This adds
a Record
option to
your device’s
Control
Centre. When
you’re ready
to record your
live video,
swipe up from
the bottom
of the screen
to open the
Control

countdown will begin, giving you plenty
of time to minimise the window and
switch to your chat app.

The Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000 (RIPA, bit.ly/
ripa440) states that it’s not illegal to
record conversations, provided they
are for your own personal use. If, for
example, you’re recording a chat so
that you have a copy of any facts or
figures quoted by the other person,
that’s fine. However, if you’re
recording the conversation in order
to pass it on to a third-party or post
it online, you’re legally obliged to
inform the person on the other end
IS IT LEGAL TO RECORD PHONE CALLS?
that they’re being recorded. If you
don’t, you could find yourself facing
a civil claim if they can prove you’ve
breached their privacy.
You don’t necessarily need the other
person to agree to being recorded
before or during the conversation – you
can also obtain consent retrospectively.
You might get away with not telling
them you’re recording if the chat is
deemed to be “in the public interest”,
but this is all a bit of a grey area, so
tread carefully.

to photos, media and
files. When prompted
to give Files Go
permission to access
your files, tap Allow. 1
The app then checks

you decide whether or
not to keep it. If you
find an app you have
no further use for, tap
the circle next to it 2
to select it.

You’re shown
the amount of
space you’re
using on your device,
as well as the total

ost new Android devices have a reasonable
amount of storage but this can quickly fill up
with photos, videos, apps and music. On top of
that, updates to existing apps and everyday tasks such
as browsing the web can add to the build-up of clutter.
Before you know it, you’ll start seeing warnings about
the lack of space on your device.
Google has released a new app for Android devices
that can help reclaim some of your missing storage.
In addition, it can also help you find files faster, back
up content to the cloud and share files with

Find out what other people search for on your PC
I
f you share your PC with family or friends, you might want
to keep an eye on the searches they’ve been carrying out.
NirSoft’s My Last Search software collates the search
queries typed into all the browsers on your PC and lets you
arrange the results by browser, search engine
or query. The free program can also create
handy reports and lists that you can keep
for future reference.
MyLastSearch: www.nirsoft.net |
10 mins |
Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10
1
Go to the NirSoft site, search for mylastsearch and
download the software to a folder – it’s portable, so you
don’t need to install it. Double-click the MyLastSearch
application to run it. The software will start scanning your
browsers’ history files for reference to search engines.
2
By default, the results are sorted alphabetically by the
term searched. This makes it quick and easy to scroll
through the results looking for anything suspicious. You
can easily spot if people have searched with different search
engines 1 or browsers 2 from the ones you usually use.
3
To order the results by a different column, click the
heading at the top. 1 This makes it easier to go through
the results if you want to find those specific to
a particular time, browser or search engine. Click again
to switch the order from ascending to descending.
4
To only see results from a specific browser, click
Options 1 and choose Advanced Options 2 from the
menu. Untick any browsers 3 you don’t want to see
results from and click OK. 4 The results will be filtered
immediately, displaying the new information.
5
If you find any results you want to keep, so you can
refer back to them without having to search again,
left-click to highlight them, using Shift and Ctrl to select
multiple entries. Right-click the selection and choose ‘HTML
Report - Selected Items’ 1 to open it in your browser. 2
6
The tool can be launched with command-line
parameters to produce specific filters, sorts or report
types. Open Command Prompt and change to the
folder the software is stored in. 1 Type MyLastSearch.exe

features’. What you’ll discover, however,
is that you can’t remove a lot of the
default apps because the uninstall option
is greyed-out. For those, you’ll need
a more thorough tool, such as IObit

you how to use it in our Mini Workshop,

How to...
Configure Windows 10

Windows 10 can slow your old or under-powered PC to a crawl.
Wayne Williams offers tweaks and changes to get it up to speed
Remove bundled apps
The first thing you’ll want to do is strip
away any Windows 10 apps you don’t
need. This will free up hard-drive space
and may also result in fewer processes
running in the background.
There are several ways to remove apps.
You can right-click an app’s entry in the
Start menu and select Uninstall, or you
can go to Settings, then Apps, and

indows 10, like every other
version of Microsoft’s
operating system, is a little
bloated. Each major update brings new
apps and features, may of which you
may never use. The Fall Creators
Update, for example, comes with two
apps for Mixed Reality (Microsoft’s
own version of augmented reality),
two versions of Paint (Paint and Paint
3D) and two browsers (Edge and
Internet Explorer). It also offers niche
tools such as Groove Music and Xbox.
All these added extras require ever
more resources, which means
Windows 10 may struggle to run on
an older or under-powered PC. In this
issue’s Weekend Project, we’ll explain
how you can remedy this.

Slim down Windows
To remove unwanted features in
Windows 10, type Programs and
features into the search box and select
‘Turn Windows features on or off’
(it won’t be the top option). In the
window that opens, untick any tools
you don’t need but make sure you don’t
disable anything important. For example,
you can safely remove Internet Explorer
11, Hyper-V, Windows Media Player
(found under Media Features), Microsoft
Print to PDF, Work Folders Client and
XPS Viewer. Click OK to remove the
selected items.
Clean up after updates
Every time Windows 10 installs a feature
update – the Fall Creators Update, for
example – it backs up the previous

Decline any bundled junk offered
during installation, then run the

powerful applications such as
Photoshop, so remove anything that’s
too resource hungry. You can filter the

2 Tick any software you want to
remove 3 and click Uninstall. 4
2
IObit Uninstaller can remove
Windows apps that were bundled
with Windows 10, which aren’t easily
uninstalled in the operating system itself.
Click Windows Apps 1 and expand the
Windows Apps section. 2 To remove an
individual item, click the bin icon next to
it, 3 then click the Uninstall button. 4
3
You can remove multiple apps in
one go. Tick the boxes for any
bundled software you don’t require, 1
then click the Uninstall button. 2 The
program can intelligently delete any
leftover files and settings relating to
those apps once the uninstallation
completes, if you want it to.
Reduce your Windows footprint
There are two files on your PC that can
take up huge amounts of space,
depending on how much memory your
PC has – pagefile.sys and hiberfil.sys. The
former is an area of your hard drive that
acts as virtual memory, while the latter is
hibernation data, used to start up your
PC more quickly. Windows manages the
page file size for you and does a great
job for the most part. You can switch this
to manual control, but you could end up
causing your PC to slow down even
more. Our advice is to leave it alone.
Hiberfil.sys is another matter. When
you put your PC into hibernation
(as opposed to shutting it down or
putting it into Sleep mode), Windows
copies everything in the memory to a file
on your hard drive called Hiberfil.sys,
Cleaning up after a Windows 10 update can free up a lot of

version of Windows. This is in case you
encounter a problem with the new
version, so you can use the back-up to
easily roll your PC back to how it was
before the update. The downside is that
the backed-up version can be huge –
in the tens of gigabytes. If you’re sure
you don’t want to roll back Windows,
you can remove this content and free up
the space.
To do this, type Disk Cleanup into
the Windows 10 search box, then click
the Disk Clean-up entry. Make sure your
main system drive (usually C:) is selected
and leave Windows to calculate how
much space can be freed up. Click the
‘Clean up system files’ button and
Windows will recalculate your space
savings, then give you the option to
remove Previous Windows Installations.

Compact OS is a command-line
tool, which means you have to type
the relevant commands into a window,
rather than launching an app and
clicking buttons. Type cmd 1 into the
Windows search box, right-click the
Command Prompt entry 2 and select
‘Run as administrator’. 3 The
Administrator Command Prompt
window opens. 4
2
Before you compress your operating
system, you’ll want to make sure it
isn’t already compressed (it shouldn’t
be, but it’s better to be safe than sorry).
Do this by typing Compact.exe
/CompactOS:query into the Command
Prompt window (note the capital letters
in the command) 1 and press Enter.
It should say: “The system is not in the
Compact state.” 2
3
Assuming your PC isn’t
compressed, type Compact.exe
/CompactOS:always into the
Command Prompt window 1 and
press Enter. It will go to work and
reduce the size of Windows 10 and its
pre-installed apps. The process will
take 20 minutes or so to complete.
When it’s finished, you’ll see the
compression ratio achieved. 2
MINI WORKSHOP | Use Compact OS to compress Windows
and then powers down properly.
When you turn on your computer again,
Windows loads this saved file into the
memory, bypassing the usual boot
checks, so you can resume where you
left off. The size of Hiberfil.sys is directly
linked to the amount of memory you
have installed: the more memory,
the larger the file.
You can reduce the size of Hiberfil.sys,
or remove it entirely. To do this, type cmd
into the Windows search box, right-click
the Command Prompt entry and select
‘Run as administrator’. To shrink Hiberfil
.sys, type powercfg /h /type
reduced and press Enter. This command
will reduce the size of the file by a third.
If you want to go back to the full-size
Hiberfil.sys file, use the command
powercfg /h /size 100 and press
Enter.
To switch this off entirely, type
powercfg /h /off and press Enter.
Move to the cloud
Where possible, you should consider
using web-based apps rather than
installed software.
This pushes the
heavy lifting that
your PC can’t
handle on to cloud
servers, which
is exactly the
approach that
Google has taken
for turning low-specification
Chromebooks into usable PCs. There are
several excellent online image editors,
office suites, video editors and more to
choose from. While you might prefer
Chrome (or Firefox) over Edge, using
Microsoft’s browser with Windows 10
makes a lot of sense, because its high
level of integration provides advantages
that its rivals don’t have. Chrome and
Firefox both consume a lot of memory,
especially if you have a large number of
add-ons installed. Try to limit the number
of tabs you have open at any time, too.
Use Compact OS
While removing unwanted extras and
freeing up space can help with speeding
up Windows, another trick that can
reduce the operating system’s footprint
significantly is to use the Compact OS
function. This is essentially a replacement
for the old WIMBoot (Windows Image
File Boot) feature, which compresses all
Windows installation files and bundled
apps, freeing up space. We show you
how to use the Compact OS in our Mini
Workshop, below.
This is a built-in Windows 10 tool and,
as such, should be perfectly safe, but
we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that
using it (and indeed any tool that makes
major changes to your system) is not
without risk. For that reason, we
recommend you make a full backup of
your PC beforehand – just in case.
Chrome is a better browser but Edge
uses fewer resources on Windows 10

less and reduces the data transferred.
Click the power icon in the taskbar
and drag the slider all the way to the
left. Alternatively, click the notifications
icon at the right-hand end of the taskbar
and click the Battery Saver tile.
Use metered connections
Some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay
for internet access and charge by the
megabyte. To keep the cost down,
Windows lets you set your Wi-Fi
connection as metered, to minimise
internet activity and reduce the data
transferred. Open Settings and click
Network & Internet, then select WiFi
and click the Wi-Fi connection on the
right. Scroll down to the ‘Metered
connection’ section and flick the
switch to On.
Pause OneDrive
When the OneDrive folder on your
computer’s hard drive syncs with your
OneDrive online storage, it uses
internet data. If this is a problem,
OneDrive can be paused to reduce
its usage. Click the up arrow on the
taskbar to show the tray of icons,
right-click the OneDrive cloud icon
and select Pause Syncing. You can
set the duration to 2, 8 or 24 hours.
Vary the time of day
Some internet plans provide a mix
of metered and unmetered usage.
For example, there may be usage
limits at peak times of the day, such
as 4pm to 11pm, but outside of these
hours it may be unmetered.

‘Data usage’ on the left and you’ll see
a summary displayed on the right for
both Wi-Fi and wired networks.
If you want to know which items are
using the most data, click the ‘View usage
details’ link to see the total data used by
your system and apps. What is surprising
is that apps you haven’t used sometimes
appear in the list. This is because they run
in the background to update or sync.
The information displayed is from

is unlimited. That’s the time to disable
‘Battery saver’, set the Wi-Fi as
unmetered and allow updates,
downloads and syncing (with OneDrive,
for example) to take place.
Change broadband providers
Internet plans with limited downloads
are being phased out and many ISPs
now offer unlimited downloads. If you
are on a limited plan, such as a fibre deal
that only allows 25GB of data, it may be
time to switch. You could get a plan that
costs the same, but is unlimited.
Having said that, ‘unlimited’ doesn’t
generally mean ‘without any limits at all’,
and terms and conditions in the small
print of the contract are likely to impose
some restrictions. However, you don’t
need to be as careful with the
bandwidth you use as you do with
a limited internet plan.
Stop updating apps
The apps bundled with Windows 10
aren’t that big but some apps in the
store, mainly games, can be over 1GB in
size. The Store app automatically
updates your apps, and this can use
a significant amount of internet data,
which is why it’s best to carry out
updates in manual mode so you can
choose when and how often they occur.
Open the Windows Store app, click
the three-dot menu in the top-right
corner, then turn off the switch in the
‘App updates’ section.
Save data on Android
Google Datallay is a free app that aims
to minimise your data usage so you
don’t unwittingly go over your limit and
incur charges. Install it from the Google
Play Store and it will allow all your apps
to have internet access when Wi-Fi is
available. At other times, when you can
only access mobile data, Datally
automatically blocks any unnecessary
and background
apps. You can

automatic updates and reduce your
data usage, open Google Play Store,
tap the menu button in the top-left
corner and press Settings. Press
‘Auto-update apps’ and select ‘Do not
auto-update apps’. Once a month,
open the store, press the menu, tap
‘My apps & games’ and press Update
All. Updating in this way
uses less data.
Refresh Android
apps less often
Some apps let you choose
how often they refresh or
sync, and choosing a longer
time interval reduces the
data used. In Twitter, for
example, tap your photo at
the top and select ‘Settings
and privacy’. Press ‘Data
usage’ to see the settings
that reduce data.
Images can be hidden,
and both ‘Video autoplay’ and
‘High-quality video’ can be set to
‘never’. Down at the bottom is ‘Sync
interval’ with options ranging from
every five minutes to daily. Longer
time periods use less data. Look for
similar settings in other apps.
Save data on iOS
The iPhone and iPad have similar
data-saving options. For example,
go to Settings, iTunes & App Store
and in the Automatic Downloads
section, turn off Updates. The App
Store icon shows a red badge when
updates are available but they don’t
download unless you open the store,
press Updates in the bottom toolbar
and then Update All. Do this once
a month to save data.
Turn off Wi-Fi Assist
Your iPhone can automatically switch
from Wi-Fi to 3G/4G mobile data if the
Wi-Fi signal is low. This improves web
access but uses more mobile data.
To turn it off, go to Settings, Mobile
Data and scroll down to the bottom.
Turn off the Wi-Fi Assist switch.
Limit iOS apps to Wi-Fi
To reduce mobile data usage, restrict
iPhone apps to Wi-Fi only. Go to
Settings, General, Background App

INTERNET
Understand varying download
speeds
Q
I recently ran an internet speed
test to check the speed of my
connection, but the results are very
confusing. When I used the Internet
Health Test (bit.ly/speed440) as
recommended in What’s New Online,
Issue 437 (bit.ly/webuser437), it
indicated that I had a download speed
of around 18Mbps. Then I tested it again
using the Internet Speed Test extension
(bit.ly/intst440) in Opera, and it showed
a download speed of just 3Mbps.
In the past, I’ve conducted tests
with the BT Broadband Speed Hub
(bit.ly/bt440), and this has reported
download speeds of around 15-18Mbps,
which is what I should be getting.
Whenever I actually download anything,
though, the speed is usually around
2Mbps. Why are the results from
these speed checkers so different?
Bob Hubbard, via email
A
Lots of things can affect the speed
of your internet connection. The
number of people using the internet
varies throughout the day and heavy
traffic can slow down the whole
network. Evenings are particularly busy,
and ISPs may impose download limits or
throttle speeds on some internet plans
when demand is at its highest.
If a website receives more visitors
than it can cope with, it will slow down,
no matter how fast your internet
connection is. To combat this problem,
some websites throttle their speed to
stop heavy users hogging the bandwidth
and preventing others from accessing it.
It’s also possible that your computer
is using the internet in the background
– to download Windows updates, virus
definitions and so on – while you’re
trying to perform your speed test. This
takes up some of your personal internet
bandwidth, which can cause speed tests
to run more slowly.
With so many factors in play, it’s no
wonder speed tests can vary so
dramatically. However, you can increase
the test’s accuracy by doing it on a
Sunday morning after the PC has been
running for at least 15 minutes. That’s
the quietest time. Open an incognito or
private browsing window to run the
speed test so it isn’t bogged down by
browser extensions or web history.
HARDWARE
Fix a non-booting DVD
Q
I’ve bought an HP computer, but
I can’t see the DVD drive in the boot
menu, which means I can’t boot from
a DVD. Can you help?
Tom Hutchings, via email
A
First, insert a CD or DVD into the
drive and open or play it to check
that the drive is working. If it is, insert
a bootable disc in the drive and restart
your PC. A message should appear
asking whether you want to start the PC
from the CD/DVD or start normally. If
you see this message, everything is
working fine.
If you tried starting your computer
with a bootable disc in the drive and
nothing happened, restart your PC and
press F9 several times after powering
on. Provided you press it at the right
time, a boot menu appears with a list of
options. Some HP computers require
you to press the Esc key first, followed
by F9. The CD/DVD drive option should
be listed but may be hidden if there’s no
bootable disc in the drive.
Some PCs let you set the boot order
Q
I’ve lost 21GB of hard-drive space
after installing the Windows 10
Creators Update. Several folders have
appeared, including ‘found.002’,
‘Windows10Upgrade’, ‘Windows.old’
and ‘XXUSB Drive Backup’. Most are
small or empty, but ‘Windows.old’ is
21.3GB. What is it for, and do I need it?
Julian King, via email
A
Files with names such as
‘found.002’ are drive faults that
have been corrected, so you can
delete them. XXUSB Backup may be
from a backup program, but it’s
nothing to do with Windows Update.
Major updates such as the Fall
Creators Update need over 5GB of
hard-drive space for the installation
files. During installation, the installer
backs up Windows to Windows.old, in
case you need to undo the update if it
fails or restore the previous version of
Windows if you don’t like the upgrade.
Windows deletes Windows.old and
other files after 30 days, but if you
can’t wait, go to the Start menu, find
the Windows Administrative Tools
section and click Disk Cleanup. When
the window appears, click the ‘Clean
up system files’ button. After
rescanning, Disk Cleanup reappears
with a new list of items. Tick them all
and click OK to remove them.

HARDWARE
Choose graphics hardware
Q
Earlier this year, I bought a PC with
an Intel Core i7-4500U processor,
which has Intel’s HD 4400 graphics
chipset built in. I’ve installed the latest
drivers and it works satisfactorily, but
should I have bought a graphics card,
too? Please can you explain the
advantages of using a graphics card
rather than Intel’s graphics hardware?
Barry Singleton, via email
A
A chipset is a set of computer
chips that perform a particular
function. Graphics chipsets are made by
companies such as Intel and Nvidia, and
come in different versions, such as Intel
HD Graphics 4000, Intel Graphics 6000
and so on.
PCs use expansion cards, which
plug into slots on the motherboard,
to perform specific functions. A few
years ago, you needed a graphics or
video card to display anything at all
on a screen, because the motherboard
and main processor didn’t have the
necessary components built in.
Since then, computer technology has
become more efficient and functions
that once required expansion cards
by pressing F10, F6 or F2 after switching
on the power but before Windows
loads. Alternatively, the CD/DVD drive
may automatically become the first
boot device if Windows fails to start.
If you’re having trouble accessing the
boot options and so on because you
can’t press the function keys at the right
time, disable Windows fast startup.
Open the Control Panel and click Power
Options. Click ‘Choose what the power
buttons do’ on the left, then click
‘Change settings that are currently
unavailable’. Finally, remove the tick
next to the option ‘Turn on fast startup’.

Q
Both my laptop and desktop PC run
Windows 10 with the Fall Creators
Update. Following the instructions in
your Weekend Project in Issue 437 (bit
.ly/webuser437), I successfully created
a Windows 10 rescue disc using AOMEI
PE Builder (bit.ly/aomei440) on my
laptop. I’ve tested it on the laptop and
I’m pleased with the results. Can I use
the same disc for my desktop PC or do
I need to create another one?
Henry Wood, via email

A rescue disc contains a minimal
operating system that you can use
to start your PC, and software tools to
help you get it running again. Because
both of your computers use the same

Q
Since updating my PC to the latest
version of Windows 10 (1709),
I have to log in twice. I enter my
password, but then Windows presents
the login screen again. After that,
it starts as usual. What can I do?
Mick Ward, via email
A
One fix is to open Settings
(Windows+i) and click Accounts,
then ‘Sign-in options’. In the Privacy
section, switch off the option to ‘Use
my sign in info to automatically finish
setting up my device after an update.’
If you can’t see this option here, go
to Settings, ‘Update & Security’ and
select Windows Update on the left.
Click ‘Advanced options’ on the right
and you should see it there.
Another method that works for
some people is to press Windows+R
and type netplwiz, then press Enter.
In the window that appears, select
your user account and clear the tick
from the box ‘Users must enter a user
name and password to use this
computer.’ Restart Windows and
repeat the procedure, then tick the
box again.

If you have to sign into Windows twice,

are now often integrated on the
motherboard. Single chips can perform
more than one function, and many
processors now have graphics hardware
built in. This means the motherboard
and processor have all the necessary
components to produce the screen
display, so you don’t need a separate
expansion card. All this results in more
efficient manufacturing processes and
smaller, less power-hungry PCs.
Built-in graphics chipsets are
perfect for general office work, web
browsing and simple gaming, and
they have significant benefits for
the size and battery consumption of
laptops. However, if you want to play
sophisticated 3D games, you still need
to upgrade your internal graphics with
an expansion card. These have bigger
and better graphics chips that can
process more information and produce
greater detail and better frame rates,
particularly when processing 3D games.
They also require more power, and
they have their own built-in memory
so they don’t hog the resources
your PC needs for other tasks.

Remove Pocket from Firefox
I’m sure there are people who think
it’s great that read-it-later tool Pocket
(getpocket.com) is now built into
Firefox, but I’m not one of them. I’ve
never used it and don’t intent to start
now. Fortunately, I’ve found out how
to remove it from my browser.
Type about:config into the address
bar, press Enter and click the ‘I accept
the risk’ button if it appears. Start typing
pocket into the search box and when
you see ‘extensions.pocket.enabled’
in the results below, double-click it.
You need to change the entry in the
Value column from ‘true’ to ‘false’.
Doing this disables Pocket, but its
content still shows up on the New Tab
page. To remove that as well, open a new
tab, click the cog icon in the top-right

Navigate around a cluttered
Desktop
Is your Windows Desktop a mess of
shortcuts and folders that you don’t
want to delete in case you ever need
them? If so, you can find the shortcut
you want more easily by typing the first

To find Audacity, for example, press the
‘A’ key repeatedly to highlight and cycle
through all the shortcuts that begin

Fix a misbehaving phone
by cleaning the SIM
My five-year-old Samsung Galaxy S5
Android phone started to play up
recently. The voicemail message
indicator was displaying constantly on
the home screen, even when I had no
new messages. Writing, sending and
receiving texts became erratic, too, and
only worked some of the time.
Despite lengthy conversations with my
mobile network provider’s tech-support
department, they couldn’t fix the
problem, even after rebooting my device
at their end. It got to the point where
they decided they couldn’t help me. They
suggested there may be a fault with the
phone and said they would have to
reinstall the
operating
system.
To do this,
I would have
to clear all
my texts
and take the
phone to one
of their shops
to try the SIM
in a different
phone to see
if the problem
persisted. This
all sounded
a little too drastic so I took matters into
my own hands. I removed the SIM card
from my phone, rubbed the contacts on
a piece of clean cloth for 10 seconds and
put it back in. It has been working
perfectly ever since!

TOP TIP
In the past, I used a utility to analyse
my hard drive to find out which files
and programs were taking up the most
space. I’ve now uninstalled it because
Windows 10 has something similar
built in. It doesn’t provide quite as
much detail as the standalone tool, but
it’s good enough for me.
Open the Settings app (press
Windows+i) and select System, then
Storage to view your drive usage as
a graphic. Click a drive entry, such as
C:, to see a list of the items that
occupy the most space.
You can click some of the items in
the list for more information. Click
Other, for example, to see a list of your
files and folders arranged with the
biggest at the top. Click ‘Apps &
games’ to find out how much space
the various Windows Store apps use.

Type, don’t click
Did you know that you can open
programs by searching for them rather
than using the Start menu? To open
Notepad, for example, click the search
box on the taskbar and type notepad.
It appears at the top of the search
results, and you can click it to run it.
Similarly, if you start typing ‘wordpad’,
‘paint’, ‘regedit’, ‘sticky notes’ or any
other program you want, you can click its
name in the search results to run it. You
don’t even need to enter the full name.
If you press Windows+S, then type ph,
for example, the Photos app appears
at the top, and you can click to run it.
If you’re feeling really lazy and don’t
even want to type, click the microphone
icon to the right of the search box and
say the name of the program you want
to open, such as “notepad”. If you say
something more ambiguous, such as
“Photos”, you may be asked which
photos app you want to run, assuming
you have more than one.

Add icons to Gmail
Gmail lets you add stars to emails by
clicking the gray outline in the inbox
next to an email. Click the star again
and it changes to a different symbol,
such as a blue ‘i’ or a green tick.
If you’ve tried clicking a star two
or three times and nothing happens,
click the cog icon and select Settings.
On the General tab, you’ll see a Stars
section, which has two lists: ‘In use’ and
‘Not in use’. Drag any items you want
from the ‘Not in use’ list to ‘In use’.
Clicking a star icon in an email cycles
through the items in the ‘In use’ list.
These icons provide another way to
search for emails. Type has:green-
tick in the search box to see all the
emails you’ve tagged with that icon.
You can also search for ‘has:yellow-bang’,
‘has: blue-info’ or ‘has:purple-question’ to

SECURITY
Use Norton’s free tool to kill
browser infections
My computer was recently infected with
a piece of malware called Apusx.com
(don’t type that into your browser!).
I’m not sure where I got it from because
I only ever install commercial software
from trusted sources. However, the
malware hijacked all my browsers, which
kept redirecting me to the Apusx site.
I checked that my browsers’ default
pages were set correctly and deleted
a Registry entry for Internet Explorer
that referred to the malware. Then I tried
to run Malwarebytes (www.malwarebytes
.com), Zemana AntiMalware (bit.ly/
zem440) and HitmanPro (www
.hitmanpro.com), but none of these tools
could remove the malware. Finally, the
free Norton Power Eraser (bit.ly/npe440)
managed to release my browsers from
the redirect trap.

Q
I have two Windows 10 laptops and
both are displaying the message
for last April’s Creators Update:
“coming soon, would you like to be one
of the first to receive it?”.
I realise my tiny laptop won’t ever
get the update because its hard drive
is so small (with Windows 10 and a
bare minimum of software installed it
only has 5GB spare). However, my
other laptop has plenty of space and
should be able to run the update, even
though it only has an Intel Core i3
processor with 4GB of memory.
I don’t particularly care about the
update (or the more recent Fall one)
because I don’t think any of the
improvements are of use to me, but I’m
interested in keeping my laptops

Get your mic working
in Skype
Q
My computer came with Realtek
Audio installed. I have no idea how to
use it but that doesn’t usually matter
because I get sound with no trouble. The
exception is Skype.
In Skype’s audio settings, I have both
the speakers and microphone set to
‘Realtek high definition audio’. The
microphone jack is plugged into the
microphone socket on the front of the PC
and is not set to mute. However, I can’t
get a reaction from the PC when I test
the sound in Skype’s audio settings or
when I make Skype calls. I can hear the
person at the other end but they can’t
hear me. I have fiddled with the settings
in the Realtek Audio Manager to no avail.

Start by making sure that you have
the latest Realtek drivers. To do this,
open the Device Manager by starting to
type device manager into the
Windows search box, then click the
option when it appears. Click ‘Sound,
video and game controllers’, then double-
click ‘Realtek High Definition Audio’ to
open the Properties window. Click the
Driver tab and click the Update Driver
button.
Next, check that the microphone is
switched on. Go to Settings (Windows+i)

microphone, so make sure Skype is
included.

menu that appears. After its first scan,
click the ‘Clean up system files’ button,
which provides more options to delete.
If it says it can clear a significant
amount of space, it’s worth running.
The dism command can also be
used to clean up the WinSxS folder,
which can become bloated. Open the

Banning children’s phones
is disrespectful
I’m writing to those who disagree with
my response to Barry’s column ‘Stop
your children phubbing you’ in Issue 433.
They keep saying the children are
disrespectful, but what’s described has
nothing to do with respect and
everything to do with coercion. Lord
Sugar states that he has banned
smartphones in the dining room. The
tone of the original article is clearly in
favour of using force to stop “phubbing”
at all costs. The problem is that coercion
does not work and is counterproductive.
The inevitable result will be that the
children will do everything in their power
to avoid visiting grandpa and, if forced
to talk, they’ll say only enough to avoid
punishment. Indeed, it’s Lord Sugar who
is being disrespectful to his grandchildren
and he will ultimately pay the price.
Terry Bradley talks
about the “art of
conversation”, but
conversation requires
a minimum of two
willing participants.
How anyone can enjoy
a conversation with
someone who is
having their arm twisted is beyond me.
As I mention in my original response,
if the children want to converse with
grandpa, they will gladly put down their
phones with no pressure or intimidation.
If Lord Sugar were a little wiser,
he’d make an effort to reach out to his
grandchildren and befriend them on their
level, rather than imposing unpopular
rules. Remember, strategy always wins
over brute force, hands down.

it would take two weeks, but the
earliest they could manage was
1 December. The engineer turned up
but said he could not move the
broadband because he couldn’t access
a cupboard and refused to wait while
we contacted the landlord.
After a long conversation with EE,
we rescheduled for 5 December and
this time the engineer was able to
access the cupboard. However, he said
Give us the broadband service we pay for
it was too complicated for him and
he would come back later with another
engineer. This did not happen and we
contacted EE again for another date,
7 December. This time the engineer
didn’t turn up at all.
EE told me it was the fault of
Openreach, but at no time were we
contacted to be told the engineer
was not attending. The next
appointment was 11 December.
This time the engineer did turn up
but did not have an ADSL ﬁlter,
so I had to pick one up myself.
I have complained to EE, who
refunded the month my granddaughter
was without broadband and reduced
my bill by £50. Having made ﬁve
phone calls to EE, four of which
involved being on hold for an hour,
I am totally disillusioned. During the
time my granddaughter was without
broadband, she was using mobile data,
which cost me over £30.
Broadband providers treat us with
disdain and do not realise we are
actually customers and as such are
entitled to the service we paid for.

Android update permissions
go too far
I read with interest your news story in
Issue 437 about Android devices being
out of date. I must admit that I have
stopped updating mine.
The reason is that each time the device
asks me to authorise an update, Samsung
wants access to my contacts list and
phone logs. There is no legitimate reason
for this that I am aware of – in fact, it is
almost certainly illegal. It certainly is in
Europe and deﬁnitely in the UK, under
the Data Protection Act (or their
versions of it). Barry Collins’
column in the same issue may
also be relevant on this.
Without listing the speciﬁc
sections and sub-sections of
the Data Protection Act,
it clearly violates the ﬁrst, second,
third, ﬁfth (possibly), seventh and eighth
(possibly) Data Protection Principles.
Anyone doing business in the UK is also
bound by our laws, wherever their main
ofﬁce is based. Not that the UK
Information Commissioner is any use

Most apps for tablets
are rubbish
Most apps are useless and not even
secure – Web User should do a write up
of the worst ones! I only need a few on
my tablet: Kindle, Just Eat and my
banking apps, which I would only use
in an emergency on a tablet.
I have to laugh at the adverts advising
bamboozled old people to buy cheap
tablets loaded with essential apps. Only
about ﬁve or six are useful; the rest are
garbage, but they look good in the
advertising photo. Any dutiful offspring
who knows a bit about tablets should be
shot if they buy that rubbish
for their parents. Amazon
Fire tablets are a similar
price and the only drawback
is that some useful apps are
only on Google Play. Bezos

in Sussex, by the way, not John
O’Groats, in case you were wondering.)
About six weeks ago, things suddenly
went a bit Three-ish. Calls were not
connecting indoors, and those that did
manage to struggle through were
intermittent. Anyone tapping my phone
would think I was being stalked by
Norman Collier,
God rest his
stuttering soul.
Eventually my
patience snapped
and I called BT. I
kid you not, I was
midway through
explaining the
problem to the
BT chap when the call dropped. He rang
me back a couple of minutes later and
said: “I see what you mean, pal”.
The BT chap then proceeded to run
through his pre-prepared support
script, offering to replace my SIM card
and have the phone checked by BT’s

engineers, even though the phone works
fine everywhere else. He too then began
muttering about work being done on
the local mast, which I’m now 99% sure
is what mobile networks say when
they’ve run out of all other excuses.
Could I have one of those signal
boosters that hooks up to your
broadband and
amplifies your
mobile signal?
“We’ve stopped
doing those,” said
the BT chap. “But
you can buy one
off the internet!”
Actually, they’re
still illegal if not
bought from a mobile network. “Ah,”
says the chap. “I didn’t know that.”
So what am I meant to do, I ask?
“Well, there’s nothing we can do,” he
replies. “We don’t guarantee indoor
coverage.” I refer him to the 4G signal
checker on the BT website, which says
my precise postcode will be bathed in
“very good indoor and outdoor signal”.
“Yes,” he mutters embarrassedly. “But
that’s not a guarantee.” No, just a lie

So how about we cancel the contract
and call it quits then? You can even have
my phone back, if you like. “Ah, sorry sir.
That’s not possible,” says the manager
I’ve now been forwarded to. “If you want
to cancel your contract early, it’s £565.”
Dear BT: there’s more chance of me
paying for a family holiday to Chernobyl
than there is of me giving you the thick
end of six hundred quid for a service
you’re not delivering. You’re going to
be hearing an awful lot more from me
over the next few weeks. You’ll know
it’s me calling because every third word
will be silent.

elp me, I’m being held hostage
by BT. The ransom fee is £565.
All major credit cards accepted.
Let me explain. About a year
ago, as revealed on this very page, I had
a major falling out with my then mobile
network Three. Reception in my house
had become so poor that I could barely
make or receive a call without
wandering out into the garden. Not a
major hassle on an August lunchtime,
but a tad inconvenient on a sub-zero
night in January.
Three fobbed me off for weeks with
excuses about engineers repairing a
local mast before we finally parted ways
midway through my contract. I gave
them my (ageing) phone back, and I
was freed without a charge. A no-score
draw on the pools coupon.
I jumped ship to BT Mobile and,
initially, things were much better. Indoor
reception was occasionally wobbly but I
could make 90% of calls sat at my desk
or on the sofa. (I live in a modern suburb
