In this paper, we discuss some interesting
properties
of the electromagnetic
potentials
in the quantum
domain. We shall show that, contrary to the conclusions
of classical mechanics,
there exist effects of poten-
tials on charged particles,
even in the region where all the fields (and therefore the forces on the particles)
vanish. Ke shall then discuss possible experiments
to test these conclusions;
and, finally,
we shall suggest
further
possible developments
in the interpretation
of the potentials.
1. INTRODUCTION
N classical
electrodynamics,
the vector
and
scalar
&- potentials
were
first
introduced
as a convenient
mathematical
aid for calculating
the fields. It is true
that in order to obtain a classical canonical
formalism,
the
potentials
are
needed.
Nevertheless,
the
funda-
mental
equations
of motion
can always
be expressed
directly
in terms of the fields alone.
In the quantum
mechanics,
however,
the canonical
formalism
is necessary,
and as a result,
the potentials
cannot be eliminated
from the basic equations.
Never-
theless,
these equations,
as well as the physical
quan-
tities, are all gauge invariant;
so that it may seem that
even in quantum
mechanics,
the potentials
themselves
have no independent
significance.
In this paper,
we shall show that the above conclu-
sions are not correct and that a further
interpretation
of the potentials
is needed
in the quantum
mechanics.
2. POSSIBLE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATING
THE ROLE OF POTENTIALS
IN THE
QUANTUM
THEORY
In this section,
we shall discuss several
possible
ex-
periments
which demonstrate
the significance
of poten-
tials
in the quantum
theory.
We shall
begin
with
a
simple example.
Suppose we have a charged particle inside a "Faraday
cage" connected to an external
generator
which causes
the potential
on the cage to alternate
in time. This will
add to the Hamiltonian
of the particle
a term V(x,t)
which
is, for the region
inside the cage, a function
of
time
only. In the nonrelativistic
limit
(and
we shall
assume
this
almost
everywhere
in the following
dis-
cussions)
we
have,
for
the
region
inside
the
cage,
H=Hp+V(t)
where
Hp is the Hamiltonian
when
the
generator
is
not
functioning,
and
V(t) =ep(t).
If
leap(s, t) is a solution
of the Hamiltonian
Hp, then the
solution for H will be
&=/pe
'«&, S=
—V(t)dt,
which follows from

The new solution
differs from the old one just by a
phase
factor
and
this
corresponds,
of course,
to no
change in any physical
result.
Now consider a more complex experiment
in which a
single coherent electron beam is split into two parts and
each part is then
allowed
to enter a long
cylindrical
metal tube, as shown in Fig. 1.
After the beams
pass through
the tubes,
they are
combined
to interfere
coherently
at F. By means
of
time-determining
electrical
"shutters"
the
beam
is
chopped
into
wave
packets
that
are
long
compared
with
the wavelength ), but short
compared
with
the
length of the tubes. The potential
in each tube is deter-
mined by a time delay mechanism
in such a way that
the potential
is zero in region I (until
each packet is
well
inside
its tube). The potential
then
grows
as a
function
of time, but differently
in each tube. Finally,
it falls back to zero, before the electron comes near the

edge of the tube. Thus the potential
is nonzero
only while the electrons are well inside the tube (region
II). When the electron is in region III, there is again no
potential. The purpose of this arrangement
is to ensure
that the electron is in a time-varying
potential
without
ever being in a fmld (because the 6eid does not penetrate
far from the edges of the tubes, and is nonzero
only at
times when the electron is far from these edges).

tion

This corresponds
to another
experimental
situation.
By means of a current
Qowing
through
a very closely
wound
cylindrical
solenoid
of radius E., center at the
origin and axis in the s direction,
we create a magnetic
field, H, which
is essentially
confined
within
the sole-
noid.
However,
the
vector
potential,
A,
evidently,
cannot be zero everywhere
outside the solenoid, because
the
total
Qux
through
every
circuit
containing
the
origin is equal to a constant
where

It is evident
that the interference
of the two parts at
E will depend on the phase difference (Si—Ss)/It. Thus,
there is a physical
eGect of the potentials
even though
no force is ever actually
exerted
on the electron. The
eGect is evidently
essentially
quantum-mechanical
in
nature
because it comes in the phenomenon
of inter-
ference. We are therefore not surprised
that it does not
appear in classical mechanics.
From relativistic
considerations,
it is easily seen that
the covariance
of the above conclusion
demands
that
there
should
be similar

involving
the vector
potential,
A.
The phase
difference,
(Si—Ss)/5,
can also be ex-
pressed
as the
integral
(e/It)gpdt
around
a closed
circuit in space-time,
where
q is evaluated
at the place
of the center of the wave packet. The relativistic
gener-
alization of the above integral
is

where the path of integration
now goes over any closed
circuit in space-time.
As another
special case, let us now consider a path
in
space
only
(t=constant).
The
above
argument
To demonstrate
the eGects of the total Qux, we begin,
as before, with a coherent beam of electrons. (But now
there is no need to make wave packets. ) The beam is
split into two parts, each going on opposite sides of the
solenoid, but avoiding it. (The solenoid can be shielded
from the electron beam by a thin plate which casts a
shadow. ) As in the
former
example,
the
beams
are
brought
together at J (Fig. 2).
The Hamiltonian
for this case is
$P—(e/c) Aj'
In singly connected
regions,
where H= V&(A=O, we
can always obtain a solution for the above Hamiltonian
by taking
it =itse
'e/", where
ps is the solution
when
A=O and where V'S/5= (e/c)A. But, in the experiment
discussed above, in which we have a multiply
connected
region
(the region
outside
the solenoid),
fee 'e/" is a
non-single-valued
function'
and
therefore,
in general,
not a permissible
solution
of Schrodinger's
equation.
Nevertheless,
in our problem
it is still possible
to use
such
solutions
because
the wave
function
splits
into
two parts P=Pi+fs, where Pi represents
the beam on

side. Each of these beams stays in a simply
connected
region. We therefore
can write

where Si and Ss are equal
to (e/c) j'A dx along
the
paths
of the first and second beams,
respectively.
(In
Sec. 4, an exact solution
for this Hamiltonian
will be
given, and it will confirm the above results. )
The interference
between
the
two beams
will
evi-
dently
depend
on the phase diGerence,
(Si—Ss)/k= (e/kc)
A dx= (e/bc)itis
This eGect will exist, even though
there are no magnetic
forces acting
in the places
where
the electron
beam
passes.
In order
to avoid
fully
any
possible
question
of
contact of the electron with the magnetic
field we note
that our result would not be changed
if we surrounded
the
solenoid
by a potential
barrier
that
reQects
the
electrons perfectly.
(This, too, is confirmed
in Sec. 4.)
It is easy to devise hypothetical
experiments
in which
the vector potential
may inQuence
not only the inter-
ference pattern
but also the momentum.
To see this,
consider a periodic array of solenoids,
each of which is
shielded
from direct contact with the beam by a small
plate. This will be essentially
a grating.
Consider
first
the diGraction pattern without the magnetic
Geld, which
will
have
a discrete
set of directions
of strong
con-
structive
interference.
The eRect of the vector potential
will be to produce a shift of the relative
phase
of the
wave function
in diGerent
elements
of the gratings.
A
corresponding
shift
will take place in the directions,
and therefore

of fine permanently
magnetized
"whiskers". ' The
solenoid
can be used
in Marton's-
device, ' while the whisker
is suitable for another
experi-
mental
setup4
where
the separation
is of the order of
microns and the whiskers
are even smaller
than this.
In principle,
we could do the experiment
by observing
the interference
pattern
with and without
the magnetic
Qux. But since the main
effect of the Qux is only to
displace the line pattern
without
changing
the interval
structure,
this would
not be a convenient
experiment
to do. Instead, it would be easier to vary the magnetic
Qux within
the same exposure
for the detection
of the
interference
patterns.
Such a variation
would, according
to our previous
discussion,
alter the sharpness
and the
general form of the interference
bands. This alteration
would
then
constitute
a verification
of the predicted
phenomena.
When
the
magnetic
Qux
is altered,
there
will,
of
course, be an induced electric Geld outside the solenoid,
but the eGects of this Geld can be made negligible.
For
example,
suppose
the
magnetic
Qux
were
suddenly
altered
in the middle of an exposure. The electric field
would then exist only for a very short time, so that only
a small part of the beam would be aGected by it;
4. EXACT SOLUTION
FOR SCATTERING PROBLEMS
Ke shall now obtain an exact solution for the problem
of the scattering
of an electron
beam by a magnetic
field in the limit where the magnetic
Geld region tends
to a zero radius, while the total Qux remains fixed. This
corresponds
to the setup described
in Sec. 2 and shown
in Fig. 2. Only this time we do not split the plane wave
into two parts. The wave equation
outside the magnetic
field region is, in cylindrical
coordinates,
3. A PRACTICABLE EXPERIMENT TO TEST FOR
THE EFFECTS OF A POTENTIAL WHERE
THERE ARE NO FIELDS
As yet no direct experiments
have been carried out
which confirm the effect of potentials
where there is no
Geld. It would be interesting
therefore
to test whether
such effects actually exist. Such a test is, in fact, within
the range of present possibilities. ' Recent experiments'

have succeeded
in obtaining
interference
from electron
beams that have been separated
in one case by as much
as 0.8 mm. It is quite possible to wind solenoids
which
are
smaller
than
this,
and
therefore
to place
them
between
the
separate
beams.
Alternatively,
we may
obtain localized lines of fiux of the right magnitude

This means that the probability
of Gnding
the particle
inside the magnetic
Geld region approaches
zero with R.
It follows that the wave function
would not be changed
if the electron were kept away from the field by a barrier
whose radius also went to zero with R.
The general solution
in the limit of R tending
to zero
is therefore

that
the

will
combine
with
the first to make a single-valued

this in more detail presently for the special case n =n+-,'.
In the interference

in Sec. 2,
diffraction
effects, represented
in Eq. (21) by the scat-

have
been
neglected.
Therefore,
in this
problem, it is adequate
to use the first term of Eq. (21).
Here, we see that the phase of the wave function
has a
di6'erent
value depending
on whether
we approach
the
line 8=&m from positive
or negative
angles, i.e., from
the upper or lower side. This confirms
the conclusions

5. DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANCE
OF RESULTS
The essential result of the previous
discussion
is that
in quantum
theory,
an electron
(for example)
can be
influenced
by the potentials
even if all the field regions
are excluded
from it. In other
words,
in a field-free
multiply-connected
region of space, the physical proper-
ties of the system
still depend
on the potentials.
It is true that all these effects of the potentials
depend
only on the gauge-invariant
quantity gA dx = J'H ds,
so that in reality they can be expressed
in terms of the
fields inside the circuit. However,
according
to current.
relativistic
notions,
all fields must interact only locally.
And since the electrons cannot reach the regions where
the fields are, we cannot
interpret
such eGects as due
to the fields themselves.
In
classical
mechanics,
we
recall
that
potentials
cannot
have such significance
because the equation
of
motion
involves
only
the field quantities
themselves.
For this reason,
the potentials
have been regarded
as
purely
mathematical
auxiliaries,
while
only
the
field
quantities
were
thought
to
have
a direct
physical
meaning.
In quantum
mechanics,
the essential difference is that
the equations
of motion of a particle are replaced by the
Schrodinger
equation
for a wave.
This
Schrodinger
equation
is obtained
from a canonical formalism,
which
cannot
be expressed
in terms
of the fields
alone, but
which
also requires
the potentials.
Indeed,
the poten-
tials play
a role, in Schrodinger
s equation,
which
is
analogous
to that of the index of refration
in optics,
The I.orentz
force Lem+(e/c)vt&Hj
does not appear
anywhere
in the fundamental
theory, but appears
only
as an approximation
holding
in the classical
limit. It
would
therefore
seem natural
at this point to propose
that, in quantum
mechanics,
the fundamental
physical
entities
are the potentials,
while the fields are derived
from them by differentiations.
The main objection that could be raised against
the
above suggestion
is grounded
in the gauge
invariance
of the theory.
In other
words,
if the potentials
are
subject to the transformation
A„—+A„'=A„+elf/rlx„,
where P is a continuous
scalar function,
then
all the
known
physical
quantities
are left unchanged.
As a
result, the same physical behavior
is obtained
from any
two potentials,
A„(x) and A„'(x), related by the above
transformation.
This means that insofar as the poten-
tials are richer in properties
than the fields, there is no
way to reveal this additional
richness. It was therefore
concluded that the potentials
cannot have any meaning,
except
insofar
as they
are
used
mathematically,
to
calculate the fields.
We have
seen from
the examples
described
in this
paper
that
the above point
of view
cannot
be main-
tained
for the general
case. Of course,
our discussion
does not bring
into question
the gauge
invariance
of
the theory. But it does show that in a theory involving
only
local interactions
(e.g., Schrodinger's
or Dirac's
equation,
and
current
quantum-mechanical
field the™
ories),
the potentials
must,
in certain
cases, be con-
sidered as physically
effective, even when there are no
fields acting on the charged particles.
The
above
discussion
suggests
that
some
further
development
of the
theory
is needed.
Two
possible
directions
are clear. First, we may try to formulate
a
nonlocal
theory
in which,
for example,
the
electron
could interact
with
a field that
was a finite
distance
away. Then there would
be no trouble
in interpreting
these results,
but, as is well known,
there
are severe
diKculties
in the way of doing this. Secondly,
we may
retain
the present
local theory
and, instead,
we may
try to give a fur&h|;r nqw interpretation
to the poten-

tials. In other words,
we are led to regard A„(x) as a
physical
variable. This means that we must be able to
define
the physical
difference
between
two
quantum
states which dier only by gauge transformation.
It will
be shown in a future paper that in a system containing
an undefined
number
of charged particles
(i.e., a super-
position
of states
of difFerent
total
charge),
a new
Hermitian
operator,
essentially
an angle variable,
can
be introduced,
which is conjugate to the charge density
and
which
may
give a meaning
to the gauge.
Such
states
have
actually
been
used
in
connection
with
recent theories of superconductivity
and superQuidity12
and we shall show their relation to this problem in more
detail.

Theory of Multiyle
Scattering: Second Born Ayyroximation
and
Corrections
to Moliere's Work

The formula
given by Moliere for the scattering
cross section of a charged particle by an atom, on which
has been based the formula
for the "screening
angle" x
in his theory
of multiple
scattering,
has been
examined
and found to contain an inconsistent
approximation
in all orders of the parameter
n~= sZ/137p
except the lowest
(the first Born approximation).
In the present
work, the correct expression
of Dalitz is
used for the single-scattering
cross section of a relativistic
Dirac particle by a screened atomic field up to
the second Born approximation.
It is found that the effect of the deviation
from the first Born approximation
on the screening angle is much smaller than Moliere's expression for this quantity
would lead one to believe.
This is so because the deviation
from the first Born approximation
is very small at the small angles that go
into the definition
of the screening
angle. In Moliere s work, all the effect of the deviation
from the erst
Born approximation
on the distribution
function f(0) for multiple
scattering
is contained
in the quantity 8
which depends only on x .In the present work, it is shown that in a consistent treatment
of terms of various
orders in nr, there exist additional
terms of order sZ/137 in the distribution
function. These terms, which
represent
the second Born approximation,
become
important
at large
angles.
Calculations
have
been
carried out for the scattering of 15.6-Mev electrons by Au and Be.The 1/e widths of the distribution
function
obtained
are in good agreement
with the experimental
result of Hanson
et al., whereas
Moliere's
theory
gives too great a width compared
with the experimental
value in the case of Be.
I. INTRODUCTION
'HE theory
of scattering
of fast charged
particles
by atoms
is of importance
for the
analysis
of
such
experimental
results
as the
scattering
of high-
energy
mesons
and
electrons
in going
through
sheets
of matter. An "exact" theory of multiple
scattering
has
been given by Goudsmit
and Saunderson. ' Its applica-
tion to a specific scattering
problem
invokes the knowl-
edge of the law of single scattering
by an isolated atom.
In a paper
in 1947, Moliere'
gives
a, (nonrelativistic)
formula
for the scattering
of a fast charged particle by
a screened
Coulomb
field, in which
an approximation
higher
than
the
usual
first
Born
approximation
is
attempted.
In a second paper Moliere'
gives a theory
of multiple
scattering
which
has later been shown
by
