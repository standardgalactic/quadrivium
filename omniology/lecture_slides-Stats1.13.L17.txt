Factorial ANOVA 
•  Two Independent Variables (IVs)  
•  One Dependent Variable (DV)

Example 
•  Suppose an experiment is conducted to 
examine the effect of talking on a mobile 
phone while driving 
– IV1: Driving difficulty 
– IV2: Conversation demand 
– DV: Driving errors 
5 
Example 
6 
Factorial ANOVA 
•  Three hypotheses can be tested: 
– More errors in the difficult simulator? 
– More errors with more demanding 
conversation? 
– More errors due to the interaction of driving 
difficulty and conversation demand? 
7 
Factorial ANOVA 
•  Three F ratios 
– FA 
– FB 
– FAxB

Factorial ANOVA 
•  Main effect: the effect of one IV averaged 
across the levels of the other IV 
9 
Example 
10 
Factorial ANOVA 
•  Interaction effect: the effect of one IV 
depends on the other IV (the simple 
effects of one IV change across the levels 
of the other IV) 
11 
Example 
12

Factorial ANOVA 
•  Simple effect: the effect of one IV at a 
particular level of the other IV 
13 
Example 
14 
Factorial ANOVA 
•  Main effects and interaction effect are 
independent from one another 
15 
Factorial ANOVA 
•  Remember, factorial ANOVA is just a 
special case of multiple regression   
– It is a multiple regression with perfectly 
independent predictors (IVs)

Remember, GLM 
•  General Linear Model (GLM) 
•  Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + e 
•  Y = DV 
•  X1 = A 
•  X2 = B 
•  X3 = (A*B) 
19 
F ratios 
•  FA = MSA / MSS/AB 
•  FB = MSB / MSS/AB 
•  FAxB = MSAxB / MSS/AB

MS 
•  MSA = SSA / dfA 
•  MSB = SSB / dfB 
•  MSAxB = SSAxB / dfAxB 
•  MSS/AB = SSS/AB / dfS/AB 
21 
df 
•  dfA = a - 1 
•  dfB = b - 1 
•  dfAxB = (a -1)(b - 1) 
•  dfS/AB = ab(n - 1) 
•  dfTotal = abn - 1 = N - 1 
22 
Follow-up tests 
•  Main effects 
– Post-hoc tests 
•  Interaction 
– Analysis of simple effects 
•  Conduct a series of one-way ANOVAs (or t-tests) 
23 
Effect size 
•  Complete η2 
•  η2 = SSeffect / SStotal
 
•  Partial η2 
•  η2 = SSeffect / (SSeffect + SSS/AB)

Lecture 17 ~ Segment 2 
Factorial ANOVA 
Example 
31 
Example 
•  Strayer and Johnson (2001) conducted an 
experiment to examine the effect of talking on 
a mobile phone while driving    
•  They tested subjects in a driving simulator.   
32 

10/7/13	

9	

Example 
•  To manipulate driving difficulty, they simply 
made the driving course in the simulator 
more or less difficult 
33 
Example 
•  To manipulate conversation demand, they 
included two “talking” conditions:  
–  In one condition the subject simply had to repeat what they 
heard on the other line of the phone  
34 
Example 
•  To manipulate conversation demand, they 
included two “talking” conditions:  
–  In the other condition the subject had to think of and then say 
a word beginning with the last letter of the last word spoken 
on the phone 
–  For example, if you hear “ship”, say a word that begins with 
the letter “p”, such as “peach” 
35 
Example 
•  IV1 = driving difficulty (easy, difficult) 
•  IV2 = conversation demand (none, low, high) 
•  DV = errors in driving simulator
