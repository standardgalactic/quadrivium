Dedication
I hereby dedicate this book to two dear friends, Anthony Choi, and Michael Wellman, who help
make my dreams a reality and make my reality that much more enjoyable. They have defined
my success with my online ventures and I wouldn’t be where I am without their help, knowl-
edge, patience, dedication, and drive. You two are my inspiration!
Author’s Acknowledgments
I have to give a BIG thanks to the superb team at Wiley for making this book a reality and trusting
me to guide the way. I have to especially thank Blair Pottenger for his infinite patience, advice,
and steady guidance, as well as Steven Hayes for his encouragement and faith. I also have to
thank Michael Bellomo for keeping me on the straight and narrow, an exhausting job to be sure.
And where would I be without the editors at Wiley, like Jenn Riggs, to make me sound so clear
and grammatically correct? 
Secondly, I’d like to acknowledge the various e-commerce store owners, IT professionals, and
friends who gladly gave their time, advice, and opinions to help me craft this book: Anthony and
Yvonne Choi, Lynn Dralle, Phil Dunn, Joshua MacAdam, James Marchetti, Chandler and Sharon
Rice, and Joshua Schwartz. Also, I have to thank several assistant managers at the San Diego
Kinko’s locations for helping me as I holed up there for weeks and weeks to get this book writ-
ten. (Thumbs up to Christine Seliger and Dan Chandler.) The Napa and Point Loma locations are
ACES in my book, and the 24-hour Hazard Center Mission Valley location was my lifeline! 
Lastly, thanks to my family for putting up with my late-late-night writing sessions and frequent
seclusion to get this book ready for publication. Your support is always invaluable.

Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Introduction
Y
ou’re not a dummy, even if you think you are. But starting your own business
can be a challenge — and then, when you add the computer part to it . . .
well, the whole thing can seem so overwhelming that you avoid it. (What? Never
crossed your mind?)
Okay, now that you’re looking at this book, you probably decided that you’ve
avoided it long enough, and now you’re going to do it — bite the bullet and build
your Web store. I want to help you get the job done as quickly as possible with the
least amount of pain. You’ve got lots of other things to do, after all, because running
your business will be the most important part.
About This Book
Web site programming isn’t exactly a fun subject — unless, of course, you’re a
programmer . . . and even then it might not really be all that much fun, because of
all the options and things you could do that might not work down the road. Some
people would rather set up a cardboard table in front of their house and try to sell
things than organize their efforts with a Web store. I’m here to help you get past the
ugly part so that you can start enjoying the benefits of being a store owner.
What benefits? Well, when you have your Web store, you have your own business,
with a set of customers, cash flow, and a brand. Yes, every Web store has their own
brand (maybe not as recognizable as Coca-Cola or IBM) that is defined by how they
present themselves, treat their customers, and operate as an Internet entity. Many
Web store owners have given up their day jobs and have the freedom to work from
home, raise their kids, and set the course of their own future. Some people keep
their day jobs, but make a nice secondary income from their Web store to help them
and their families. Then, there are the retail store owners who are joining the 21st
century and putting their operations online to reach a whole new market segment;
that’s got a global reach, by the way.
Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies shows you how to set up your Web store and
all the steps you should think about before, during, and after the setup process. I
take great pains to give you step-by-step instructions whenever possible to get you
up and running. But it’s also a real-life-situation kind of book. I show you what to
consider as a Web store owner without forcing you to pick one specific Web store-
front provider. I throw out some business techniques and give you options for how
you want to build your Web store and interact with your customers. As you’ll see,
there are a lot of things you can sell, and a lot of ways you can build your Web store.
This book is designed to be your guide, with flexibility and assistance throughout
these pages.

Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
What You Can Safely Ignore
Throughout the book, I include Web store tips — you can probably ignore those
unless you’re interested in that kind of stuff and want to make your life easier.
Oh, and the gray boxes that you see throughout the book? Those are sidebars, and
they contain extra information that you really don’t have to know but that I thought
you might find useful and interesting. So feel free to skip the sidebars as well.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ll be honest — I had to assume some things about you to write this book. So, here’s
what I assume about you:

You already know a little something about the day-to-day stuff that you need
to do to run your store — you know, figure out that you want to sell some-
thing, come with a list of products to sell, take orders, pack and ship your
products, and so on. I don’t assume that you know how to do all that on a
computer.

You have a personal computer (that you know how to turn on) with
Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista. I wrote this
book by using Windows XP.
How This Book Is Organized
Every great book needs a plan. I divided this book into six parts, each made up of
chapters so that you can easily find the information that you need.
Part I: Planning and Gathering
If you’ve never operated your own store or business, you probably want to read this
part. I first go into the different kinds of things you can sell on your Web store. While
many of you would think, “Duh, you sell stuff,” the answer is actually more than that.
I talk about how you can sell products at a higher margin, or how you can sell other
people’s products, as well as information, advertisements, or your own homemade
products. Then, I talk about all the different policies your Web store should have in
place before that first order comes in. Nowadays, the privacy policy is considered a
requirement, but there’s also the matter of your shipping policy, return policy, and
payment policy. Even if you don’t set them in stone at this phase, you should think
about them before building your store.

Introduction
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store
In this section, I cover the essential building blocks of getting your Web store up and
running:

How to select the right Web storefront provider (what features should you
look for, and what should you pay for).

How to sign up with a payment processor so you can accept credit cards on
your Web store.

How to design your store on paper so it’s easier to build the right sections.
We go into some massive detail by actually opening a Web store account with three
main providers: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, ProStores, and 1&1 eShops. For each of
these, I show you exactly how to open an account, create your Web store, and fulfill
the basics to get it operational. (For Parts 3–5, I use Yahoo! Merchant Solutions as
my storefront provider when showing you examples. Understand, however, that the
concepts I present in this book work for any storefront provider.)
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves)
In this section, I cover the steps you take after constructing the basic Web store-
front. First and foremost is your catalog of products, so I spend an entire chapter
helping you get the catalog created in an efficient and correct manner. Next, I talk
about the images and descriptions that will make up your product catalog, and tips
and tricks to make those as professional and appealing as possible. Then, I open up
the discussion about functions you can add to your Web store to engage your cus-
tomers and keep them coming back for more, from a discussion board so they can
chat with each other to a Web store specific search engine and customer accounts.
(For specific ways you can enhance your Web store, check out Web Sites Do-It-
Yourself For Dummies, by Janine Warner, as she focuses on the non-commerce 
ways to improve your Web store.) Finally, I talk about the importance of tying your
Web store operations to the “back end,” so shipments get out correctly. I walk you
through the main shipping companies and how to set up your own store account
with each service.
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store
In this part, I cover a variety of steps that you should take before you start taking
orders on the Internet. Yes, you’ve worked hard to get to this part, building a Web
store from scratch and filling it with products, functionality, and a great look and
feel. But a polished Web store goes through some finalization, so here I talk about
putting your store at the hub of your sales by integrating your Web store URL into
every single thing you do in your business. I then talk about an extensive site-wide
review of the Web store, looking for any outdated or incorrect information, cleaning
up any spelling or grammatical errors, and making sure that each page is correctly
linked to each other. Finally, I have you check to make sure every section of your

4
Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Web store is “talking” correctly with every other section, and how to put your Web
store up on the Internet early to have friends and family check it out first and place
sample orders (or real orders, whatever you prefer).
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing 
of Your Web Store
In this section, I cover all the all-too-important tasks of promoting your store, once
you’ve worked so hard to build and perfect it. I talk about ways you can build “buzz”
online through different marketing efforts like creating a blog, having a customer
newsletter, or selling on other sites, like eBay, to gain attention for your Web store.
I then move into the area of paid advertising, where you can take out pay per click
advertising ads on search engines like Google and Yahoo! to drive traffic to your 
Web store. I even talk about how to send your Web store information directly to the
search engines. Finally, I discuss that “next step” in Chapter 18, when you should be
thinking of hiring employees or independent contractors to handle the “fun” stuff
like packing and shipping, or maybe even a redesign of your Web store. I even talk
about using the Internet, through sites like Prosper.com, to get additional funding or
financing for your Web store expansion plans.
Part VI: The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the first steps and thoughts you
should undertake when trying to build your own Web
store. Chapter 1 talks about the different types of products
or services you could sell on your Web store, and provides
a few examples. I then talk about the “back-office” elements
that any Web store owner should have, as well as some
Web sites that help provide these services for you, and
how to enroll with these services. 
I then talk about an often-overlooked part of operating
your Web store, which are the policies and rules that make
your Web store function. I give examples about elements
like a privacy policy, return policy, and other policies that
should be defined before you open for business so every-
one knows the rules of your business.

W
hen you think of opening your own store, you usually
have to consider a game plan that involves scouting out a
retail location, negotiating a price per square foot, buying fixtures,
carpeting, and lighting, assembling shelves and stocking tangible
merchandise, and planning for a grand opening campaign that
could involve balloons, a big ribbon to be cut, and lots of festivities.
Today, you can open your own store on the World Wide Web, without
physical rent costs or high-capital investments. In the United States,
as of 2007, over 211 million Americans have Internet access, accord-
ing to Internet World Stats (www.internetworldstats.com).
More importantly, as of September 2007, Pew Internet & American
Life Project reported that 50% of U.S. Internet users had broadband or fast Internet
access at their home.
Consumers are overwhelmingly using the Internet to do their personal and holiday
shopping, which presents a great opportunity for Web stores to take advantage of
this growing population. Worldwide, Internet access is growing in practically every
country, with shipping companies making Beijing as likely a customer target as
Boston.
So, the question is raised: How can you take advantage of this growing, eager
market? In this chapter, I begin to walk you through some of the steps you should
take in the planning stages of building your own Web store. Later in the book, I 
walk you through the steps of actually building, filling, and promoting your Web
store successfully.
Deciding What to Sell
It’s very common to be in this situation: You know you want to build a Web store,
but you’re unsure exactly what to sell in your store. Perhaps you own a physical
retail store and you want to add a Web store to offer multiple ways for your cus-
tomers to reach your products. Perhaps you want to close down your physical

store and only offer your products through a Web store. In these cases, your ques-
tion is not what to sell, but rather, which of your items would sell best in a Web
store? After all, if you sell heavy items, the shipping cost may make it prohibitive for
your customers to save money and for you to make money. (One of the reasons
Pets.com filed for bankruptcy was having to ship 50 pound bags of dog or cat food
for free or very little money.)
Let’s assume, however, that you don’t currently have a physical store and you’re
trying to decide what it is that you want to sell. One way to get started is to ask
yourself a few questions:

What do you know? Can you turn information or experience from a hobby
into your own store? Can you identify a rare antique? Do you know what the
hottest toy should be next year? Do you know where to get all the different
types of remote-controlled cars, airplanes, and boats? Do you know the dif-
ference between an amplifier and a subwoofer? Your experience in the area
will help you identify the manufacturers or product sources, spot the latest
trends, and understand the nuances of that particular market, plus you can
identify with your customer so you know what they’ll be looking for and
what questions they might ask.

Who do you know? It’s like the old saying goes, “It’s not what you know, it’s
who you know.” With so many e-commerce stores going up (and some of
them closing) you need to have an edge, and one way to gain a competitive
advantage is to know the right people. Perhaps you know a local business
that hasn’t sold their products online yet and needs a good partner. Maybe
you have a connection or knowledge of a wholesale source, or a good way
to get products cheaper than the average person. Sometimes, it’s as simple
as having an old college roommate who works or lives near Factory X or
ABC Distributors.

What do you like to do? Here’s another saying, “You have to love what you
do.” If you’re going to open your own Web store, don’t do it if you hate the
product you’re selling, or you simply don’t believe in it. It’ll become a rough
enterprise if you do. Ask yourself what you enjoy doing in your spare time.
Maybe you like to work with your hands and create things. You could open
your own store selling handmade jewelry, crafts, or apparel. Your focus
could be customization, offering a one-stop shop to customize your cus-
tomer’s motorcycles, cars, or RVs.

What are people asking you, or what are you good at? Sometimes, the
best market research can come from your immediate network. One question
I ask people is this, “Is there anything you know, better than most people,
where people are always coming to you and asking you questions about it?”
Maybe you’re the foremost expert on how to beat a traffic ticket. Not only
can you turn that knowledge into an informative product to sell, but you
can create a Web site with lots of great advice and sell advertising space
and related products as an affiliate member.

What do you think will sell well? Ok, you’ve read the slogans, you’ve
thought about my previous questions, but deep down, this is the one 
question some of you want to focus on. You want to pick a winning product
(hopefully, it’s a winning category — stores rarely do well on a single

11
Chapter 1: Web Stores Overview: Discovering Your Purpose
product) that will have a healthy profit margin and sell well. Use your
knowledge as a consumer, do some research online, and ask around to see if
others agree with your assessment. I don’t think there is one “magic” prod-
uct that is 100% guaranteed to work, but I do think that if you pick the right
area, like the Apple iPod after that was first released, the success of that
product could carry you far.
If you want to draw from the experience of other small business owners, here are a
few online sources (like the U.S. Small Business Administration shown in Figure 1-1)
you can check out for ideas, research, and inspiration:

12
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
In addition to the questions to ask yourself above, you also need to consider your
options for what to sell:

Tangible products: This is the most common type of thing to start selling
online, as most people understand and need physical products. Your goal
here is always the same — buy low, sell high. You focus on keeping your
costs down, and earning a healthy profit margin with each sale. Remember
that your costs are more than just the price you paid for the item in the box.
You need to factor in your overhead costs, keeping your Web store running,
your time and effort, the cost of any employees you may hire, and so on.

Homemade products: I make the distinction between tangible products and
homemade products because the former is something you order from a
manufacturer or distributor, while in the latter case you’re the manufac-
turer, distributor, wholesaler, and retailer. Here, the term accountants love
to use, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), isn’t just the cost of the raw materials
used to put together your product, but your time (or your employee’s time)
in assembling and finishing the product. In this case, your profit margin defi-
nitely has to cover the cost of your time, because in a homemade goods
business, without you, there is no business (unless you train someone to
replace you).

OPP (Other People’s Products): There are many businesses out there
that have products or services they’re eager to sell, but they need a sales
force of people to help them sell it. You can become an affiliate and sell
other people’s products in exchange for a commission you earn from
brokering the sale. This allows you to offer a wide range of merchandise
without investing in lots of inventory, stocking, packing, and shipping the
merchandise.

Information: As I mentioned earlier in this section, maybe you know some-
thing better than most people, or are always asked to explain a certain
procedure or solution. You can turn that information into an eBook or
informative product that you sell on your Web store. In today’s age of tech-
nology, you have several options to package your information product:
• eBook (PDF file)
• Audio file (CD, MP3, .wav)
• Audio/Video file (DVD, .mov, .mp4, .avi)
• Physical book
• Subscription to a newsletter (PDF or DOC file, via e-mail)
• Monthly subscription to an information Web site (all of the above)

Advertisements: If you can build a Web site that people enjoy going to,
whether it’s full of informative content, fun games and activities, or the
latest news and columns, you can earn money by selling the advertising
space on your site. Typically, you want the ads on your Web store to rein-
force the categories you offer on the store, but if you become part of a net-
work of stores, you can exchange advertisements to encourage people to
shop at multiple stores.

13
Chapter 1: Web Stores Overview: Discovering Your Purpose

Services: Sometimes, the best thing you can sell is your experience. You can
use your Web store to sell your services, whether you have a professional
talent (accountant, lawyer, PR guru), creative talent (graphic designer,
artist), technical talent (software developer, electrical engineer), or any
other kind of service that you can provide remotely. You can sell your serv-
ices by the hour or by the assignment, and use your Web store to show off
your portfolio, give away sample tips in exchange for leads, and perhaps
build an additional revenue stream by selling products you know your
clients will definitely need.

Combination of some or all of the above: Hey, why limit yourself? Feel free
to combine a few of these ideas and build multiple revenue streams for your
business. You should probably pick one to focus on first and build up. Once
you have one revenue stream rocking, think of expanding to the next area. You
can’t wake up one day and create a fully functioning site like Amazon.com,
with 41 categories, an affiliate program, and tons of extra features. Take one
at a time.
Finding Products to Sell
Okay, you have an idea of what you can sell online, now you need to find them! For
many entrepreneurs, the act of product sourcing, or getting the merchandise they
want to sell in their Web store, is not only their first big challenge, but for some of
them, their competitive advantage as well. Your goal is to find a reliable, renewable
source of quality merchandise that you can order, add a markup, and resell to your
customers at a higher price.
There are multiple options when it comes to product sourcing, so let’s look at the
most common and hopefully, the most fruitful. 
Start with what you own
When I teach people how to start their eBay business, one of the core bullet points I
cover in every class is this: Most people started selling on eBay by cleaning out a room
in their house, whether it was a closet, garage, attic, or the living room. This makes
sense for an eBay business — there are over 50,000 distinct categories to put your
stuff for sale, a built-in audience of 244 million members around the world who already
come to shop on the site, and you can start your eBay sales with one or two items.
When it comes to running your Web store, however, I don’t feel this principle univer-
sally applies. Let me explain: If you plan on opening a coin store, and you want to
use your personal coin collection as your startup inventory, great. If you plan on
starting a “Whatever I can find” store, and just stuff it with things in the garage so
you have something available to sell, not so good. Your Web store needs to have a
consistent set of categories that your customers can depend on, and a steady base
of core products to fill your catalog. You don’t want to be constantly writing descrip-
tions and taking pictures for your Web store if your products change on a whim.

14
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Pound the pavement
Unless you’re sitting on a mountain of boxed-up products ready to be sold, you’ll
need to get out and start looking. Depending on what you decide to sell, you can go
out and search for your products and buy them in whatever quantity they’re avail-
able in. Some people call this “the thrill of the hunt” because they’re looking for that
undervalued product to add to their store inventory and sell for a higher margin.
If you’re selling products that are rare, unique, one-of-a-kind, antique, vintage, or
collectible, you can fill your inventory by going to one or more of these places:

Flea markets

Thrift shops (such as Goodwill and Salvation Army stores)

Secondhand or consignment stores

Local auctions

Estate sales

Garage sales

Merchandise outlet or closeout stores
You can find a lot of these events and more by searching sites such as Craigslist
(www.craigslist.org) in your city or state, and going to their For Sale section, 
as shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-2: Find lots of local products through Craigslist.

15
Chapter 1: Web Stores Overview: Discovering Your Purpose
What if you’re looking for more common items, more “commodity,” regular everyday
items like apparel, electronics, gifts, or something similar? Thankfully, depending on
where you live, there are places you can go. Sometimes they’re called merchandise
marts or districts where wholesalers in a certain category congregate and have
offices and warehouse space. In Los Angeles, for example, there’s the Fashion
District in downtown LA (shown in Figure 1-3), where you can buy wholesale from
different apparel manufacturers. 
Figure 1-3: Find deals at places like the Fashion District.
The other big source of products that you can go and visit are trade shows. Every
industry has their own version of a trade show, convention, or national (or regional)
events. Many times, you can order products directly from the wholesalers or manu-
facturers that attend these events. Merchants gather at these trade shows to meet
the manufacturers, learn from their colleagues, and get product information. Once
you’ve identified your market or industry, you can look for trade shows in that
industry through several mediums:

Newspapers and magazines: Most industries have their own magazines 
or newspapers dedicated to their genre, from Antiques Weekly and Frame
Building News to Military Trader and Needlepointers Magazine. The big trade
shows will advertise in these newspapers and magazines, and typically,
columnists will write articles about how to approach these shows and make
the most of your experience.

16
Part I: Planning and Gathering 

Trade Associations: If you think slogans like “got milk?” and “Beef. It’s
what’s for dinner” were invented by one dairy or meat company, you’d be
mistaken. Most industries have organized a trade association that furthers
the interest of everyone in that industry, from the National Milk Producers
Federation to the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Do an online
search for your industry plus the words “trade association.”

Physical retailers: Walk into your local retail store that carries products in
your targeted industry, and ask the manager or employees if there are any
local or regional trade shows that they know about which would interest
you. While some of them may not say anything for fear of losing a customer,
others may be advertising the show in their shop.
If you’re planning to walk into Best Buy to ask about electronics, let me save
you a trip. The biggest electronics convention is the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas in early January. It’s a great show, I have a lot of fun when
I go there, and it’s where all the retailers go to figure out what to stock in
their stores for the next year.  Go to http://www.cesweb.org for more
information.
Work on the wholesale
As you work your way up the “food chain” of products, your ultimate goal as a Web
store owner is to purchase your inventory via wholesale channels and pay a lower
price than the common person, so you can afford to re-sell it at retail (or a fraction
thereof) and make money for your store. As your volume increases, you’ll get used
to ordering from a wholesaler or distributor to re-stock your inventory.
When you order direct from a wholesaler, you enjoy several advantages:

Lower prices: Because you are ordering a larger quantity from someone
who doesn’t have to cater to lots of individual buyers, you usually get a
great discount on the suggested retail price.

Steady inventory source: As you sell out of your merchandise and place re-
orders, you want to know that you can get a steady supply of this inventory.
You’re building a name for yourself in this category, and you don’t want to
earn a pool of customers only to tell them, “Oops, I can’t get any more of
this category X. Try back in a week or two.” I guarantee you, they’ll be off in
search of the next deal . . . far away from you.

Access to newer products: When you have a relationship with a good
wholesaler, you’ll find out about new product lines first, and typically 
have the chance to stock them as soon as possible, so you can keep 
your customers coming back to you.

You control the buyer experience: Because you’re ordering the products
directly and warehousing them, you can make sure that your customers are
getting the correct order, properly packaged, and with any additional sales
information you care to put in the box. You handle the returns directly, so
customers get a quicker response time.

17
Chapter 1: Web Stores Overview: Discovering Your Purpose
Of course, there are some downsides to going the wholesale route:

Up-front investment: Typically, you have to buy a sizable quantity in
advance to get the big discount. Oh, and typically, that merchandise is 
non-returnable, which means if you can’t sell it, you’re stuck with it. 

Storage space required: Once you order it and receive it, you have to 
provide a place to store or warehouse the goods until your customers 
can order it and you can ship it out to them. The more you have to order,
the more space you’ll need to keep it all.

You control the buyer experience: Yes, you’re reading it right, it’s both a
pro and a con. While you ensure a good experience, it means you also have
to coordinate the packing and shipping of these products as well, which is
an additional cost.
The other main option is something called drop-shipping. In drop-shipping, the com-
pany that holds the merchandise simply provides you with the information needed
to make the sale, like product descriptions, photos, and a wholesale price. You go
out and make the sale, and collect the money from the customer. You notify the
drop-shipper, pay them the wholesale price, they pick it from their warehouse, and
ship it directly to the customer, so you never get in the middle of that process. You
keep the difference between what you charged and the drop-shipper charged you, 
as your profit margin.
When it comes to the benefits versus drawbacks on this one, it’s somewhat the
opposite of wholesaling. There is no up-front investment, and no need to warehouse,
pack, or ship the item. However, the prices sometimes aren’t low enough, they con-
trol the experience (which means if the drop-shipper is late, runs out of the product,
or packs the item poorly, you get blamed, not them), and you rely on them to pro-
vide a steady supply of the product. In addition, you’re typically competing against
other members of their “wholesale clubs” for some drop-shippers, and the only cri-
teria left to bargain with is price. This means you’re at risk of someone undercutting
you to gain business. When there is a price war, economics teaches one basic truth:
In a price war, profits typically go to zero.
When it comes to product sourcing, here are a few Web sites to help you get on the
right track:

Worldwide Brands (www.worldwidebrands.com): They sell up-to-date
directories of information, and have a OneSource program for helping you
connect with the right wholesale companies for your needs. You can see
more of what they offer in Figure 1-4.

WhatdoISell.com (www.whatdoisell.com): This site is similar to
Worldwide Brands, but is a bit more eBay-focused. They have a great library
of information, courses, research, and suggestions that many Web store
owners could benefit from.

Liquidation.com (www.liquidation.com): They auction off lots of busi-
ness surplus goods, but usually in small enough quantities to appeal to
many small businesses.

DMOZ Wholesale Trade (www.dmoz.org/Business/Wholesale_Trade):
The Open Directory project has a directory of different wholesale sources in
various categories.

18
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Figure 1-4: Wholesale directories and more at Worldwide Brands 
If you want to buy wholesale, you’ll typically need (as a minimum) a resale certifi-
cate or sales and use tax permit that shows you’re a business. Contact your state
government’s secretary of state or type “resale license” and your state into a search
engine for more information on how to get one. Beware of middlemen helping you
get this license — go directly to a state government Web site for more information.
Establishing Your Store Information
When you set up your store, you typically need to have some contact or business
information to provide when signing up for everything. If this is a home business,
you could simply provide what you already have — your home address, telephone
number, e-mail address, credit card number, and so on. Many store owners, however,
set up their own business identity, so their business and personal information don’t
get mixed together.

19
Chapter 1: Web Stores Overview: Discovering Your Purpose
Here are some thoughts for what to set up:

P.O. Box or private mailbox service: For as little as $48 per year, you can
have a separate address to receive all your business mail and correspon-
dence. The Post Office offers P.O. Boxes for rent that you can sign up for to
help establish your business. You can also go to a private mailbox provider,
like the UPS Store (formerly Mail Boxes Etc.) and local pack-and-ship stores,
to get a private mailbox. The advantages of a private mailbox include
• Your own street address (instead of P.O. Box 1234) which gives a better
professional image of your company.
• The ability to receive packages from any shipping company, including
UPS and FedEx (some shipping companies can’t deliver to P.O. Boxes).
• The ability to have someone available during normal business hours to
sign for all your incoming packages.
When it comes to your e-mail address, you should always get one that
matches your domain name and storefront provider. We discuss storefront
providers in Chapter 3, so don’t worry about business e-mail accounts
until then.

Fax number: Despite the explosive growth of the Internet and e-mail, the fax
machine hasn’t been made obsolete enough, as the need to transmit docu-
ments continues every day. Rather than purchase your own fax machine and
pay for a dedicated phone line (or share the fax machine with your answering
machine), you can sign up for an online service that gives you a fax number
and allows you to retrieve your faxes from their Web site, or they can e-mail
you a copy of each fax as they come in. You can e-mail or upload documents
that they can fax out for you as well. Some services to check out include
• eFax (www.efax.com)
• MyFax (www.myfax.com)
• jConnect (www.j2.com)
• uReach Consumer Solutions (www.ureach.com) 
Two other sources for your own local fax number are your private mailbox
shop (whether or not you have a mailbox there) and your local FedEx
Kinko’s locations. Both of them will send and receive faxes for you based
on a $1–2 per page average rate.

Telephone number: It’s true that most people today have at least two phone
numbers, their home (landline) telephone number, and their cell phone
number. But do you really want customers calling your house or cell phone
at 2am to ask a question? Many small business owners get an extra line to
handle their business calls, or at least get a number with voicemail to field
customer concerns until the owner can call back on another line.
There’s a newer development which offers an affordable solution that’s easy
to use. Internet telephony has been booming the last few years, and one of
the leading companies in that area is Skype. Purchased by eBay in 2005,
Skype helped lead the way for people to make free phone calls, using their
computers and the Internet, anywhere in the world. In the next section, I go
through the steps needed to create your own SkypeIn number.

20
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Creating a Skype Phone Number
Skype has developed a new feature called SkypeIn, which offers you a per-
sonal telephone number with voicemail included. Anybody can call this
number and either reach you (when you’re logged in to Skype) or leave a
message in your voicemail, which you can retrieve online. It costs approxi-
mately $5–6 a month, as of this writing, and is a great way to separate busi-
ness from personal calls. In addition, you can use your Skype account to
make all your business calls, whether your customer, vendor, or supplier is in
Boston or Beijing.

Y
our Web store isn’t simply about the items you have to sell.
Your customers are a big reason why you’re in business,
and many store owners simply assume that customers will show
up as expected, buy your goods, and leave without an issue. It’s
easy to forget that the customer interaction can get complicated.
The best way to reduce most of these issues is to come up with a
set of rules and guidelines in advance, so you and your customers
know what to expect.
In this chapter, I walk you through some of the basic policies any
Web store owner needs and I go step by step into the decision-
making process that goes into crafting these policies so you can
focus later on your biggest asset — your customer.
Putting the Service in Customer Service
As you begin your journey as store owner, you need to make a lot of decisions. You
decide which products you want to carry and how much inventory to stock, what
marketing budget to create and implement, and hopefully develop a full-functioning
business plan to guide your efforts. Another element to think about is the level of
customer service you wish to provide to your customers.
As a Web store, you don’t have the luxury of meeting your customers face to face
and physically handing them the merchandise on the way out the store. You’re rely-
ing on electronic means and partners (such as shipping companies) to complete the
experience for you. In addition, depending on the model you choose to make money,
your Web store may be solely focused on low price and can’t afford to give a high
level of customer service. Therefore, you need to think about what level of customer
service you give and express that with a Customer Service policy.

Finding your level of customer service
Your goal should always be to provide the best kind of customer service that you can
afford. When I think of excellent customer service, I think of companies that make
the shopping experience as effortless and pleasant as possible. However, costs are
involved when you offer constantly staffed telephone support lines, a no-questions-
asked Return policy, and awards of discounts or gifts to handle any complaint regard-
less of who is at fault.
Your level of customer service is defined by certain elements, such as

What forms of communication can customers use to contact you?

When can customers contact you for any issue?

Who will handle your customers’ issues and where are those customer 
service representatives located?

What can your employees offer the customer when a problem occurs?

How quickly do you promise to respond to customers’ issues?
There are some elements of your Customer Service policy that are better addressed
in other documents — your Return policy for example, which addresses when and
how people can return their purchases. The main goal of the Customer Service
policy is to give your customers a concrete idea of what they can expect from doing
business with you and the guidelines you want them to follow in communicating
their issues.
Don’t expect all your customers to follow the policy blindly. When there’s an issue,
some customers yell, scream, and e-mail everyone in your company to get a solu-
tion. Be prepared internally to handle concerns that don’t come through the normal
channel, and in your response to the customer, refer them to the preferred method
specified in your policy.
Writing your Customer Service policy
So, how do you actually create your Customer Service policy? Here are some steps
to get you going:
1. Your introductory paragraph introduces your store name and indicates
your level of customer service to your customers. Many companies use this
space to express the company mission, whether that mission is to be the
low price leader or the service leader.
2. You can organize the body of your policy several different ways:
• You can use headers to separate the sections of your policy, such as
Services Offered, Hours of Operations, and Ways to Communicate a
Problem.

29
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
• You can organize your policy as a series of questions and answers with
the title of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at the top of the page.
• You can use a combination of sections that begin with a clear identifying
header, where the top of the page contains a hyperlinked list of the vari-
ous sections, so customers can click through to the section they need
without reading through the entire page. An example of this is provided
in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Warner Brothers Record Store organizes its Customer Service policy by headers and sections.
3. You need to decide the method(s) that customers will be allowed to com-
municate with you. You must offer at least one method of communication,
but you can decide to offer one or more of the following:
• E-mail: Definitely the most cost-effective method and considered the
standard when it comes to Web operations. One example is how Circuit
City uses e-mails and, more specifically, Web forms to have customers
relay issues, as shown in Figure 2-2. You can emphasize that this option is
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

30
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Figure 2-2: Circuit City uses e-mail to have their customers stay in touch.
I recommend creating a dedicated e-mail address specifically for cus-
tomer service issues. This way, customer concerns don’t get mixed in
with daily business issues, and you can assign someone to monitor this
account specifically to handle customer issues.
• Telephone: This is the most-preferred form of communication for cus-
tomers because it’s immediate and most customers have access to a
phone. You can choose to pay for a toll-free telephone number (to limit
your customers’ costs) or offer a regular phone number, which would be
a long-distance phone call for most of your customers. The other deci-
sion to make is whether this phone is staffed by a live person or whether
it goes straight into a voicemail system, where you or your employees
review the calls within a specific period of time and then return the cus-
tomer’s call.
• Mail: This is probably the least-preferred method for customers but a
cost-effective way for you to receive customer concerns. You can post an
address or, in some cases, a P.O. Box (if you don’t want to give out your
home address) that customers can write to and express their concerns.
Although regular mail (or snail mail) may seem appealing because you
don’t have an immediate caller on the line, remember that your customer
was angry or annoyed enough to write a letter, so make sure you handle
these concerns as quickly as possible especially because it takes several
days for the letter to arrive.

31
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
• Multiple methods: If you plan to offer multiple methods of communica-
tion, you can create a section of your Customer Service policy that reads
like the following example:
Contacting Customer Service
You can reach customer service by e-mail, telephone, or regular mail.
Our representatives are available to answer your phone calls between
the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and Saturday
from 9:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (except holidays).
E-mail address: custserv@yourcompanyname.com
Phone Number: (866) 555-1234
Regular Mail:
Your Store
P.O. Box 12345
Anytown, CA 12345-6789
4. After you tell your customers how to get in touch with you, it’s helpful 
to give them an idea of the response time they can expect. Your options
here can be as quick as “We promise to get back to you within 24 hours,”
whereas other companies offer response times, like “We pledge to respond
to your issue within 2 business days.” If you’re unsure or can’t promise a
specific response time, be general but state that you’ll respond in a timely
manner or as soon as possible.
5. The next area to address is the technical support or product support of the
items you sell in your store. As a retailer, usually you can refer the customer
to the manufacturer for a limited warranty on their end if the product is
defective or has any technical issues. However, you do need to state that, as
a retailer, you offer no additional or concurrent warranty with the product if
that’s the case. A simple one- to two-sentence paragraph should suffice.
If you do offer warranties on your item, you need to provide at least one
paragraph explaining the time period, type of warranty (for example, do you
offer a 30-day limited warranty, a 90-day complete warranty, or a lifetime
guarantee on the product), and how the customer should contact you to
take advantage of the warranty. This can include, but isn’t limited to, using
e-mail or a specified phone number to report the problem and ask for a
return label or providing the address to mail in the defective unit.
Also, post information about your warranty policy in your store Return
policy, which I discuss in the next section.
6. Finally, your Customer Service policy can include any other disclaimer,
copyright, or company information that would be helpful to your cus-
tomers. If there’s any important information or features about your 
company that help you stand out from the competition, talk about that
information here to inform the customer of your exciting opportunities.
Perhaps you offer online help or chat with the company founder or CEO
every quarter, or you want to communicate any specific service guarantee
you wish to provide to your customers.

32
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Writing Your Return Policy
After you’ve laid out your main Customer Service policy, think about other policies
that affect how you do business with your customers. First and foremost is your
store’s Return policy. We all dream of the situation where every item you ship to
your customers is perfectly assembled, packaged, and in working order. In the busi-
ness world, however, that’s not always the case, so you need to think about what
level of Return policy you offer your customer.
The extreme cases are easy to quantify:

A customer places an order and it never arrives. As the retailer, you have to
either replace the order or refund the customer.

The customer receives the item, but the item is completely smashed,
destroyed, and/or unusable. As the retailer, you either ship a duplicate 
item as a replacement or refund the customer.

The customer orders a Widget RX200 and receives a Widget TR500. As the
retailer, you ship the correct item and pay to have the incorrect item shipped
back, or offer a deal to the customer where they keep the incorrect item in
exchange for some compensation.
Here are some other cases that aren’t so obvious to handle:

The customer orders the item and after it arrives, he either decides that he
doesn’t want the item anymore or he dislikes the item based on a cosmetic
or non-technical issue.

The customer claims that the item never arrived, but you have tracking or
delivery confirmation that shows the item was delivered successfully.

The customer orders the item, receives it, uses it for several weeks, and
then wants to return it because he never needed it for the long term or
bought one cheaper from another retailer.
There are lots of reasons why a customer would want to return part or all of a pur-
chase he made with you, and it is up to you, the business owner, to decide how many
of these reasons become part of your Return policy. If you craft your Return policy up
front and display it clearly on your Web site, your customers can’t claim ignorance
after the order is completed and they ask you to change the rules. (Okay, they’ll ask
you, but you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether you want to honor that
request.)
The Return policy comes down to a business decision that you have to make, based
on the costs you incur and the level of service you wish to provide. Web stores are
out there (especially those that deal with used and liquidation merchandise) that
can’t afford to take back any merchandise and simply state “NO RETURNS ALLOWED”
and enforce the All Sales Are Final rule. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you
could take back all purchases, no questions asked, for a finite period of time (known
as the return window) and pay for return shipping as well.

33
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
One way to decide what type of policy to implement is to look at your online com-
petitors. Go to a few Web stores that sell your type of merchandise and look at their
Return policy. Do they take items back? How long of a return window do they offer?
Who pays for return shipping? This helps you develop your own policy because you
want to know what your competition’s offering.
The goal of your store Return policy is to offer something useful or appealing to your
customers while limiting the store’s potential loss of revenue. Therefore, make sure
that in your Return policy you address the following issues:
1.
Your first paragraph should clearly state whether you accept returns or you
don’t allow any returns. If not, the policy is very simple. If so, will you accept
returns on all merchandise, or are some items ineligible for returns? State
which products are non-returnable. Also, you can allow only exchanges — the
product can be returned only to receive another copy of the same product.
2.
If you do allow returns, make sure that your second paragraph clearly
states the Return window; in other words, how many days does the cus-
tomer have before he has to return the item? You should clarify whether the
Return window starts from the day of purchase or the day the product
arrives. Set a maximum number of days the customer has to report the
issue or return the item.
You may want to check with your suppliers and find out what their window
is for you to send back items as well. For example, if you have 30 days to
send something back to the supplier, perhaps you can give your customers
15 to 20 days to return the item so you can send the returned merchandise
to the supplier.
3.
Your second or third paragraph should also clarify the Conditions of use for
a product. You need to state that the item has to be returned in the same
(or reasonable) condition as it was sent to them. Put a note in this para-
graph that you reserve the right to reject any return if the condition of the
returned item is clearly different and/or unsellable based on the condition
when the product was sent.
4.
An optional part of your Return policy is whether you want to impose a
Restocking fee on your customers when they return something. If you take
back an item and charge a Restocking fee, the customer has to pay a small
percentage to cover your costs. These costs can include resealing the item
and integrating the return back into your own inventory. You see this term
used frequently at electronics stores, for example, because those electron-
ics have to be retested and resealed for a future purchase. Typically, retail-
ers charge anywhere from 5–20 percent of the purchase price as a
restocking fee. Make sure this fee is stated clearly in your Return policy.
5.
Your next paragraph should address the matter of return shipping, specifi-
cally who pays for the item to be mailed back to the store — you or the cus-
tomer? If there are conditions where the store pays and other conditions
where the customer pays, state those conditions in your policy. Typically,
the retailer pays for shipping when he makes a mistake on the order, and
the customer pays when he voluntarily chooses to return the product with
no technical fault.

34
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
6.
Don’t forget to clarify in a paragraph the exact Payment form of the refund.
State how the refund is issued to the customer. Will you post a credit on his
credit card account? Will you mail him a check? Will you issue him store
credit? Most importantly, does the customer have a choice as to how he’ll
receive his refund or will you offer only one method? Finally, state approxi-
mately how many days he has to wait to receive his refund.
7.
Your final paragraph of the return policy should address any Exceptions to
your stated rules. If there are certain exceptions in your Return policy (such
as addressing seasonal, liquidated, used, or timely merchandise), state that
clearly as your final paragraph in your policy.
Remind your customers that this Return policy covers only items that you sell
directly. If you’re selling any items for a third-party vendor, check with him to see 
if he offers differing rules or has strict requirements for returns that you have to
honor as a vendor.
In the end, you’ll see from your sales and customer reports how your Return policy
is working. Many big retailers talk about having return rates of 1–3 percent and feel
that their customers’ confidence in their Return policy allows them to earn more
money from their customers and, ultimately, pays for the cost of their Return policy.
However, if you’re experiencing high return rates or the same complaint is coming
up repeatedly, you may need to alter your Return policy to reflect the business issue
you’re facing.
If you alter your Return policy for any reason, you need to notify your existing cus-
tomer base that a new Return policy will be in effect and pick a starting date for the
new policy to take effect. Typically, give 2–3 weeks notice to your customers so they
can decide if this new policy will affect their orders with you.
Making Your Privacy Policy Public
Given all the problems with identity theft and online fraud, its now required for
every Web retailer to state a Privacy policy on their Web site. This policy is intended
to inform your customers as to exactly what customer information you collect, what
you plan to do with their information, and how you protect that information from
falling into the wrong hands. This policy applies to all customers and visitors to your
Web store, especially regarding any cookies, or information files that Web servers
may create for you on your visitor’s computers. Your policy, like the sample policy
from this book’s publisher, Wiley Publishing, Inc. (see Figure 2-3), lets your cus-
tomers know who sees their information and that you, as the retailer, are keeping
that information as private as possible.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has mandated that all online businesses in the
United States carry a Privacy policy that’s accessible from the home page and prop-
erly identified. You can go to www.ftc.gov/privacy to read up on more of its pri-
vacy initiatives.

35
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
Figure 2-3: Here is a sample Privacy policy from Dummies.com.
Preparing your Privacy policy
You want to provide a clear, concise Privacy policy that people can read and under-
stand as well as details on the collection of data, the use of that data, and the protec-
tion of that data, typically in that order. Therefore, here are the elements you need to
think about when writing your privacy policy:
1. In the first section of your Privacy policy, you need to state, very specifi-
cally, what kind of information you’ll be collecting from your Web store visi-
tors and/or customers. Do you require a ZIP code from every visitor, like
Radio Shack asks when you buy batteries from them? Does the customer
have to give all her personal information when she registers on your site?
You definitely need address and contact information for your customers,
but some sites go further and ask for things, like birthdate, Social Security
number, driver’s license number, or other criteria, like shirt size, height, and
weight. Finally, what financial information are you collecting? If you take
credit cards, do you also ask for the billing ZIP code or the three digit card
verification value (CVV) security code on the back of the card, on top of the
card type, number, and expiration date?

36
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
2. In the next paragraph, you need to state how you’re collecting this informa-
tion. Do customers have to enter all their information on a Web form? Are
you using technology, like the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), to protect that
information? (We discuss SSL further in Chapter 3.) Can the customer
phone in some information, like credit card numbers or bank account data?
3. In the second section of the Privacy policy, you need to state how you’re
storing this information? You don’t want to be too detailed as to how and
where you store your data. The point of this section is to relay that the
information is protected with some form of security and that the data is
stored safely. You can even state that very few personnel will have access to
your data at all. Finally, if you’re using cookies to store information on the
customer’s machine, talk about what information is being stored, whether
the customer can opt out or block the cookie from being created, and the
impact of doing so on their order.
4. In the third section of the Privacy policy, you need to state if you’re sharing
any customer data with any other business or company. This section is
meant to inform the customer whether you’re sharing, selling, or relaying
customer data to any other party. In many cases, retailers who work with
promotional partners share customer data gathered during a promotion for
use by both parties. In other cases, retailers build up customer lists for spe-
cific products and sell that data outright to other companies. Even if you
group together your customer data and sell or share only anonymous statis-
tics that can’t be traced back to individual users, state that in your policy.
Be as specific as possible even if you’re stating that customer data is seen
only by employees in your company.
5. In the last section of the Privacy policy, you need to provide information
that will allow the customer to contact you. Based on the type of informa-
tion you collect, you have to provide a method where customers can
change their records, block access from any third parties receiving their
information, and delete or opt out of your customer database at any time.

3. Fill in the appropriate blanks and select the appropriate options based on
how your site will operate. You’re asked 16 different questions, such as the
type of data you collect, different potential usage of that data, how the cus-
tomer can be contacted, and so on. Most questions give you multiple options
via check boxes, so check all conditions that apply for each question.
4. After you complete all 16 questions, you’re at the bottom of the form, as in
Figure 2-6. You have three choices to collect your generated policy:
• Generate HTML Page: The policy is generated as a Web page, which you
can then save to your computer and upload to your store.
• E-Mail Me HTML: Your policy is e-mailed to you as a Web page, which
you can save to your store’s Web site. If you select this option, be sure 
to provide your e-mail address in the e-mail Address box.
• E-Mail Me Plain Text: Your policy is e-mailed to you as plain text, which
you can then copy and paste into a Web page on your Web store labeled
as your Privacy policy. If you select this option, be sure to provide your
e-mail address in the e-mail Address box.

Writing Your Shipping Policy
One of the benefits of customers shopping over the Web is the immediate gratifica-
tion of placing their order. That benefit comes with responsibility, however, as the
retailer has to get that order shipped to the customers, many of whom want the grat-
ification of holding that package in their hands as soon as possible. Therefore, it’s
important to detail how and when you handle the shipment of customer orders so
you can properly set the expectation of when the order is fulfilled and delivered.
If you’re a Web retailer in the United States, you’re required to follow the rules of
the FTC’s Mail or Telephone Order Rule, which can be found at www.ftc.gov/bcp/
conline/pubs/buying/mail.shtm, and an example is shown in Figure 2-8. Many
of the guidelines stated have to do with the time frame of shipping, notices to be
sent if an order can’t be completed, and what to do with unsatisfactory goods and
services.

40
Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Figure 2-8: Make sure your shipping policy falls within FTC guidelines.
When you’re developing your Shipping policy, you definitely need to think about
what shipping company (or companies) you’ll partner with to build your business
(I discuss this in depth in Chapter 12). Depending on the company you choose, you
may have to come back and update this policy later. For right now, include the goals
you wish to accomplish with your Shipping policy.
Here are the specific issues to address when you are writing your Shipping policy:
1. In the first section of your Shipping policy, give your customers an estimate
of how long until their order will be sent. Here, you should talk about a gen-
eral turnaround time, or the length of time between the submitted order and
the shipping of the order. Many retailers describe this as “We ship out our
orders within two to three business days.” Sometimes, different products
have different turnaround times, and if so, state that here. (For example,
small consumer electronics may have a 2–3 day turnaround, whereas big
screen TVs may have a 7–10 day turnaround time.)
2. You should also address, in the first section of your policy, whether the cus-
tomer can get same-day shipping, and if so, provide details as to how the
customer should request this option. Remember that some customers need
(or want) their orders ASAP. If you offer Express shipping, be sure to include

41
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
a disclaimer that states when in the day the order must be received to qual-
ify for express shipping (for example, “All orders with Express shipping
selected must be received before 11:45 a.m. Pacific time to be shipped out
the same day.”)
3. In the second section of your shipping policy, you should detail the different
shipping options your customers have available. If you ship all your orders
using one company and one method of shipping (perhaps, USPS Priority or
Media Mail), simply state “All orders will be shipped using USPS Media
Mail.” If you offer customers a choice of companies and/or a choice of ship-
ping methods, describe those choices in a paragraph.
Any exceptions or special considerations should also be detailed in this 
section. One of the most famous examples of this is from Amazon.com and
states that certain orders over $25 receive Free Super Saver Shipping from
the company.
Even though the customer should see these options in the checkout form, it
never hurts to detail her options here in case she’s reading up on your store
before deciding to order.
4. As part of your second section on shipping options, you should provide
details as to whether you solely offer domestic shipping or allow for domes-
tic and international shipping for your orders. The global nature of the
Internet gives your Web store an instant potential base of customers around
the world. However, the products you sell may not lend themselves easily to
international sales. For example, if you’re selling metal anvils, the shipping
cost is probably too prohibitive to offer international shipping on them. If
you do offer international shipping, create an International Shipping sub-
section that details what countries you ship to, what shipping options and
rates are offered for overseas buyers, and any pertinent information regard-
ing taxes, customs duties, or import fees.
If you’re a Web retailer in the United States, there are some items (like soft-
ware with 128-bit encryption) that you’re not allowed to sell outside the
United States. Check with the U.S. Department of Commerce at www.bis.
doc.gov/DeemedExports/DeemedExportsFAQs.html for up-to-date
information on what’s allowed.
5. In your next section, you should address the issue of whether the customer
will be able to track their order on your Web site. You may not be able to
answer this question until you decide how many advanced functions you’re
going to build into your Web store. If you know that your users will be able
to create accounts and monitor the status of their orders, state that capabil-
ity here. Otherwise, you may want to state that customers will automati-
cally receive an e-mail when their order is shipped or offer a phone number
where they can call your store and inquire on the status.
6. In your final section, you should mention any shipping restrictions a cus-
tomer may encounter based on their address. If you use companies, like
UPS or FedEx, to handle your shipments, you can’t accept an order where
the shipping address is a U.S. P.O. Box. Therefore, if you use one of those
companies, enforce getting a valid street address from your customers. In
addition, if you don’t want to ship to Military (APO/FPO) addresses or any
other special addresses, state that in your policy.

Part I: Planning and Gathering 
Writing Your User Agreement
If you plan to offer a lot of functionality with your Web store, where users can log in
to their own customer account and perhaps access different store functionality or
additional functions, games, or applications that you provide to your customers, you
might want to consider crafting a User Agreement to set the terms and conditions
for how users can interact with your business.
Although you want your users to take advantage and use the functionality provided,
you probably want to establish some guidelines so these users know what accept-
able behavior is and what conditions cause their account to be suspended, blocked,
or deleted. The benefit of creating this early in the process means that users have to
agree to this right away and they can’t claim ignorance if a problem occurs in the
future.
Typically, a User Agreement has to be reviewed during the registration process a
user follows on your Web site. Not only do you have to provide all the terms, you
should make the user acknowledge that he or she has read the terms and agrees
with all the provisions. This can be done by having the user click a check box or
enter his initials in a specified text field.
Here are some of the specific points you should address in your User Agreement:
1. Section 1 of your User Agreement should state how a site visitor can regularly
use your Web site. Start with the basics of what functionality you provide,
and whether the site’s a free or paid service or whether certain functions are
available only to paying customers instead of all visitors.
2. Section 2 of your User Agreement should state any restrictions you are
imposing on customers who use or view your site. Do you have to impose
any age restrictions based on the type of products you’re selling (for exam-
ple, do users have to be 18 or 21 years old)? Do they have to pay a certain
membership fee, perform certain actions every month, or order a certain
amount to get access or discounts?
3. Section 3 of your User Agreement should state any copyright or legal issues
with your Web store. Do you allow your visitors to copy and paste your site
content on their Web site? Are customers giving up their copyright protec-
tion by posting on your message boards or submitting entries to one of
your contests? If you think that there may be a legal issue, consult an attor-
ney for advice in this area.
4. Section 4 of your User Agreement should state any restrictions on user-
generated content, if your Web store has user-generated content. If you
use message boards, chat rooms, or other ways to solicit and display cus-
tomer information, like customer-written reviews and guides for example,
you need to state some basic guidelines on how each area is operated.
Mainly, this section is to clearly state that no offensive, vulgar, pornographic,
copyrighted, or illegal information can be posted onto your site by anyone,
including your own employees. You’re encouraged to give some examples of
inappropriate material (without being too specific, of course) and the situa-
tions when you would remove or censor this material.

43
Chapter 2: Developing Your Store Policies
5. You should create a section of your User Agreement to discuss any extra
terms or conditions you need to create for your customers based on the
functionality you offer through your Web store. 
6. You will need a section in your User Agreement entitled Notices that
explains how you will communicate any changes, updates, or cancellations
of this User Agreement to your customers, such as “Notice will be given by
e-mail to the e-mail address provided during the registration process at
mystorename.com. Alternatively, we may deliver notice through certified
mail to the address provided in the registration process.”
7. You will need a section in your User Agreement entitled Arbitration that
details how you will handle any claims or controversy caused by the 
agreement between you and your customer. You should consult the laws
governing arbitration and business in your state, as laws vary by state. You
can also consult the American Arbitration Association at www.adr.org for
more information.
8. Finally, you should have a section in your User Agreement entitled General
that includes statements like these: This agreement shall be governed in all
respects by the laws of the state of (insert your state here) as such laws are
applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within
(your state) between (your state) residents. This agreement sets forth the
entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject
matter hereof.
Policies — The Final Word
Depending on your type of business, you may need to add additional policies, like
how you handle spam, deal with affiliates, or interact with third parties. The main
policies detailed in the preceding sections are enough to get you started. In the end,
these policies are all meant to be a guide, not literally written in stone. As time pro-
gresses, you may see the need to update, revise, or even eliminate one or more of
these policies.
The key is having a communication channel open with your customers. If a policy is
either too strict or too lenient, you need a mechanism where you hear about it and
can make changes. When changes need to be made, follow these steps:
1. Create a Web page that shows the old policy language, the new policy
language, and a clear explanation as to why the change is made.
2. Assign a date in the near future when the new policy will be in effect.
3. Use one or more communication methods (e-mail, phone, or mail) to update
your customers and visitors on the new change.
4. Place a notice on the home page, or one of your main product pages,
informing them of a policy change, with a hyperlink to the detailed policy
explanation page you create in Step 1.
5. If possible, offer a way to gather customer feedback on the new policy
change and update accordingly.

Part II
Constructing Your
Web Store

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the heavy lifting of constructing
your Web store from scratch. I start by discussing
the necessary elements you should evaluate from an 
e-commerce storefront provider in order to pick the com-
pany that will put your Web store on the Internet and
maintain the store’s operations.
I then discuss three different store-front providers in
Chapters 4, 5, and 6, and show you the essential steps for
creating an account and building the essential Web pages
to get a Web store up and running with those providers.
I picked three of the leading companies in this space,
including Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, ProStores, and 1&1
eShops.
Finally, I end this part by talking about other necessary
pieces of building your Web store, like enrolling with a pay-
ment processing firm like PayPal, and laying out your Store
Design on paper before diving into the details in Part III.

W
hen you want to open a retail store, your first steps
toward opening the doors are to find those doors . . . and
walls and floors, locating the perfect retail space, and then filling
the space with fixtures, inventory, and signage. When you’re open-
ing a Web store, one of the first big steps to making your dream
a reality is to find your “virtual” space — the virtual or Web
storefront.
Luckily for you, there are dozens of providers out there that will
provide you with all the virtual bells, whistles, and everything else
you need to get set up. Because of all the variety and different costs
out there, let’s start by taking a look at what features you need to
build your Web store.
In this chapter, we evaluate what features are available (and necessary) from the
storefront provider that you’ll need to select. We then talk about how to reserve that
other important aspect of your Web store — the domain name. Finally, we discuss
the options you can take if your perfect domain name is taken already.
Evaluating Web Storefront Providers
Thousands of people are out there that will offer you a place to build a Web 
site. What you’re looking for, however, is an e-commerce account, or something 
e-commerce capable or ready. An e-commerce account is a specific account you open
with an Internet Service Provider that has the capability to accept orders for prod-
ucts and process the payment electronically for those product orders. Let’s compare
this with opening a brick-and-mortar retail store.
You can rent all kinds of space on the Web — residential space (like the apartment or
house you live in), industrial space (where you can warehouse all your inventory or
equipment), commercial space (all those shiny office buildings that reach for the sky
and offer clean, carpeted, air-conditioned paradise while you work), and retail space
(which is space specially designed for retail activities, like selling goods to customers).
You wouldn’t expect to see a Wal-Mart in an office building or someone’s garage, just
like you wouldn’t want to get a generic Web site provider to host your e-commerce
Web store. You want to establish an account that matches the goals of your business,
and for Web stores, that’s an e-commerce account.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
E-commerce accounts differ from many of the other packages primarily because of
three components:

Shopping Cart technology

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology

Credit card processing capability
Many of the elements we discuss in the next section are available on regular Web
site plans, but the ability for customers to add items to a virtual basket, check out
securely, and pay for those items, is the essence of e-commerce, which makes these
three elements very important to your Web store future.
Evaluating storefront accounts
When it comes to picking an e-commerce account, you need to figure out the basics
of your account in terms of how many products you hope to sell, how many pic-
tures, audio, and video you plan to include on your site, and how many features your
customers will have on your site. When you go to the Web site of a Web storefront
provider, look for a link about account packages that allow you to sell online. Click
that link and then look for a link that discusses features and/or benefits. This should
let you pull up the specifics of any Web storefront provider, and when you do, be
sure to look at these aspects of the account(s) they provide:

Shopping Cart technology: If your customers can’t shop in your store, they
can’t become customers. Find out what kind of shopping cart program comes
with the account. At a minimum, you want a shopping cart that can allow the
customer to add at least 2-5 products to their basket at one time, and check
out using a credit card or PayPal account. Questions to ask include
• How many products can be added to the catalog?
• Is there a maximum number of items I can sell in my store?
• How is customer information stored for future use?
• What payment solutions are integrated with your shopping cart software?
• How are orders transmitted to you or your staff?
• How easy is it to set up?

Disk space: Think of disk space as the storage space for your Web site.
Typically, accounts start in megabytes (MB), but many accounts give a mini-
mum of 1 gigabyte (GB). If you plan on having mostly text descriptions and
very little in the way of pictures, audio, or video, disk space isn’t an issue,
and anywhere from 100 MB to 500 MB for a basic site is plenty. If you do
need to present a lot of pictures, audio, or video, go for a plan with a lot of
disk space, at least 1 or 2 GB. Questions to ask here include
• How many regular JPG images could fit on my disk space (ballpark figure)?
• Can I add additional disk space if needed to my monthly account?
• How much is additional disk space and how do I order it, if necessary?
• Do I get an automatic warning if I’m running out of space?

49
Chapter 3: Finding Your Storefront Provider

Bandwidth: If you think of your Web store as a real store on the road, band-
width is the amount of traffic flowing in and out of your store. Every time
someone looks at your Web pages, all that information has to flow over the
Internet to and from your Web server. Too much usage may cost you in the
end, as most Web storefront providers have a limit when it comes to the
bandwidth of your site. On one end, if a simple text-only site has a few visi-
tors, it has low bandwidth. YouTube, which serves up millions of video clips
a day, has very high bandwidth. If 6 million people had to drive up to one
store to get their video clips, imagine the traffic jams and problems that
would cause. An unprepared Web store can have the same catastrophe on
the Internet.
Most of the time, the bandwidth limits set by your storefront provider are
enough to do business, whether it’s 1 GB or 10 GB per month. The only con-
cern should be if you plan to offer a lot of rich data, like audio and video,
regularly on your site. Then, you may look for a plan that has 50–100 GB per
month or more. Questions to ask here include
• On average, how many people a day can go to your store given your
bandwidth limit?
• Can you pay for additional bandwidth if needed?
• How much is additional bandwidth and how quickly can it be available?
• Do I get any automatic warnings if I start to hit my bandwidth limit?
Another term related to bandwidth is data transfer, which is the specific
Internet traffic of sending a file (whether it’s a picture, audio WAV file, or
video clip) from your Web storefront to a customer or visitor’s computer.
Some storefront providers put daily, weekly, or monthly limits on the
amount of data transfer to and from your Web site. If you plan to use a
lot of multimedia on your Web store, ask your provider the same band-
width questions mentioned previously, but substitute data transfer for
bandwidth.

E-mail accounts: You can’t do business without communication, and any
good Web storefront provider includes a way for you, as the store owner, to
create e-mail accounts that match your storefront name and work in conjunc-
tion with your store. Options here range from a few accounts to thousands or
unlimited numbers of e-mail accounts. You should have a minimum of at least
2–5 accounts, so you and at least one other employee (or function, like cus-
tomer service) can have an e-mail account with your store name to interact
with customers, partners, and vendors. 
It’s always helpful to establish dedicated e-mail accounts for issues, like
customer service, affiliate relations, marketing, sales, and for employees 
in your company to communicate with each other and the customers.
Questions to ask here include
• How many e-mail accounts can you create?
• What is the size limit of each mailbox?
• How can people access their e-mail accounts (POP, or Post Office Protocol,
a popular way for e-mail applications to retrieve e-mail from a server;
WebMail, where the e-mail owner uses an Internet Web browser to
retrieve and read their e-mail; and so on)?

50
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
• How easy is it to create or suspend any particular e-mail account?
• Can I set up an e-mail address where any incoming e-mail goes to a list of
accounts instead of just one account?

Programming extensions: A lot of functionality is out there for e-commerce
operations that are written in various programming languages. For those
functions to work, your storefront provider’s computer servers have to be
able to understand the scripting language, or the set of instructions that
make up the functions. This ability is commonly expressed as programming
extensions offered or languages allowed. Questions to ask here include
• What programming languages or functions does the storefront provider
support?
• Do I need to do anything special in configuration to turn on this exten-
sion support?
• Is it possible to add support for an extension, like PHP (Hypertext
PreProcessor, a popular Internet programming language) or Microsoft
FrontPage (a popular Web function authoring software tool)?
• Is there a limit to the size or number of scripts that can run on your site?
• Are there any templates or sample code that you can download for these
extensions?

Application integration: Typically, your business needs more than just a
shopping cart software tool to help you manage all the day-to-day issues.
For example, you need accounting programs, marketing programs, online
shipping and postal tools, and possibly, systems to manage operations and
inventory management. Given all the data that your Web storefront is gener-
ating, you want the ability for your Web storefront to communicate automat-
ically and correctly with the other software programs you’ll use to run your
business. Therefore, you want to see if the storefront provider provides any
application integration tools for you to use or plan to implement. Questions
to ask here include
• Which accounting programs does the storefront provider integrate sales
with (QuickBooks, Microsoft Money, Excel, and so on)?
• Which order-processing software, if any, does the storefront provider
system link with (UPS WorldShip and so on)?
• Can you hire someone to write and implement a custom application inte-
gration tool, if needed?
• What options does the storefront provider offer to link with my payment-
processing system (credit card processing, PayPal, and so on)?

Additional features: Usually, each provider provides various options for
your Web storefront account, and picking these really depends on how 
you like to do business or how your programmers or employees need to 
do business. Sometimes, the way to decide is to go with the provider that
offers the most of what you need with a nice assortment of functions you
could use or want to use. Questions to ask here include
• What operating system will your account run on? If your programmers use
Windows development tools, ask for a Windows account. Otherwise, a
UNIX or Linux account runs lots of programming options but doesn’t
offer the same graphical user interface that Windows gives you.

51
Chapter 3: Finding Your Storefront Provider
• What databases are supported on your account? If you plan for your cus-
tomers to have accounts on your system, you’ll need a database to store
all that information. Typically, the shopping cart program coordinates
the inventory and order databases, but if you want to build additional
functionality, you need to know if your account can handle supporting
the database system you need.
• What reports and features come with your account? Because your store-
front is gathering all your Web sales, why not ask if the provider can offer
a way for automatic reports to be generated so you can see your sales,
potential, and problems. Also, any e-commerce provider should have
some functions, templates, or code they can offer their customers.
Evaluating storefront services
You’ve found the account of your dreams, with all the sizes, functions, and every-
thing else that you need built into your account. However, before you sign on the
dotted line, here are some areas you should look into with the specific provider. Just
like landlords who can offer excellent or poor service, storefront providers need to
provide acceptable levels of security, reliability, and service to handle your needs.
Consider asking or researching some of these questions in the following areas:

Security: Your goal here is that the provider protects your customer data,
your store catalog data, and of course, your store sales and order data. You
need to provide a secure experience for your customers to pay you so that
they can be sure their information won’t end up in a crook’s hands down the
road. At a minimum, you should be able to offer Secure Socket Layer (or SSL)
security for your customers. Questions to ask here include
• Does your provider offer SSL security for your customers? If not, do they
offer assistance in getting you an SSL certificate for your Web store?
• How does the storefront provider protect your data from hackers or
intruders?
• What policies does the storefront provider have in place to protect your
servers?
• What security measures are in place to guard your physical servers?
• Who has access to your account besides your site administrator?

Reliability: If there’s a problem with the Web server running your store, no
one can see or order from your store, which means you’re losing sales every
minute. You’re looking for a Web storefront provider that cares about the
reliability of its machines and has processes or systems in place to keep its
customers (meaning you and your store) up and running. At a minimum, you
should be able to expect 99% uptime or better. Questions to ask here include
• What was the provider’s uptime in the last year? In other words, out of
100 percent of the year, what percentage of time were their servers avail-
able and on the Internet? If it’s not 99 percent or better, keep looking.
• What backup procedures does the provider use to protect and restore
your data?

52
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
• What processes are in place to notify you of any hardware or software
failures?
• How quickly will someone respond to a call regarding the availability of
your account?
• Does the provider have multiple data centers and are they linked?

Service: Your storefront provider is providing you with a service, so in case
there are any issues, you need to know how to contact the provider, which
method to use, and what to expect in terms of a response. There are some
providers that charge more but provide additional levels of service, coach-
ing, and/or support; based on your needs, pick an appropriate provider with
the right level of service. At a minimum, you should have at least e-mail and
phone support available for your account. Questions to ask here include
• How do you contact the provider in case of a technical problem (via
e-mail, phone, and so on)?
• What are the provider’s customer service hours of operation?
• Do you have an account manager assigned to your account? If so, how do
you contact that person and what issues does he handle?
• How quickly can you expect your first response to any problem inquiry?
How quickly are problems typically solved?
• What help functions or guides does your provider provide online? Are
there any tutorials you can download and watch?
Picking Your Storefront Domain Name
When Shakespeare said, “What’s in a name?” he could have been talking about your
storefront domain name. A domain name is the URL Web address that your cus-
tomers will have to type to get to your Web store. If you already have a name for
your business, such as ACME Widgets, then you should select a domain name like
acmewidgets.com to preserve your business identity and bring that business name
online.
If you don’t have a business name yet, then it is time to sit down and think of a
good name for your business. Some owners tackle this problem by researching
available domain names first, and when they find a domain name they like, they
reserve that name and adopt that name for their business, like drugstore.com. It’s
generally a good idea to include a reference to what you’re selling in your store
name so customers know what your store offers. This isn’t a requirement, though.
After all, before 1995, when people thought of the word Amazon, they thought of a
river in South America, not Earth’s Biggest Bookstore. You can develop your own
brand if you have a store name that you like, as long as you understand that chal-
lenge when you begin to market your store.

53
Chapter 3: Finding Your Storefront Provider
Registering Your Domain Name
After you’ve decided on a domain name you need to pick a domain reg-
istrar. A domain registrar handles all the administrative issues regarding
your domain name, so you can file for the exclusive right to use your
chosen domain name for your Web site. The domain registrar will
create a record with the main organization that manages all Internet
domain names (known as ICANN, or Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers), and that record will link people who type in your
domain name with the Internet address of your e-commerce Web site.
Originally, there was one registrar, Network Solutions (www.network
solutions.com), but several years ago the U.S. government allowed
competition in the industry, which means that dozens of competitors
have sprung up offering the same service as Network Solutions.
Although Network Solutions has stayed in business by offering lots of
additional services, some low cost providers, like GoDaddy.com, have
sprung up and gathered a lot of customers. For this example, I use
GoDaddy.com to sign up a domain name.

After you pick all the extensions you want to
use, scroll down and click the orange Continue
button. Be warned that you’ll probably see
some screens trying to sell you additional
extensions. One thought here is that if you build
a good brand name, you want to reserve all the
different extensions up front so someone else
can’t use your brand name to build a store with
a similar name and different extension.

Click the Go! button to start your search and
have the results displayed. If your name is avail-
able (like my example, signupmystore.com),
you see the accompanying statement and the
costs associated with reserving that name. If
you want to hold the same name with more 
than one extension, click the appropriate 
check boxes to add any or all these options
(yourname.info, yourname.biz, yourname.
org, yourname.net, yourname.name, or
yourname.mobi) to your registration. If your
domain name is unavailable but you really want
it, check out the next section.

After you select all your extensions for your
domain, it’s time to create your GoDaddy.com
account. Fill in all the appropriate fields of
information and be sure to complete any field
with a red * next to it because those fields are
required for registration. Scroll down and
click the orange Continue button when you’re
ready to continue.

Now you have to define the contact information
for your registration. In this step, click the Edit
Registrant Contact Information link if you want
to assign a specific person to handle the ad-
ministrative, billing, or technical aspects of 
your registration. If you do nothing and click

GoDaddy.com asks you to confirm the length
of your registration and makes one last attempt
to sell additional services. The minimum length
of time for registration with any registrar is one
year, and the maximum that GoDaddy.com (or
any domain registrar) offers is ten years. If you
don’t want your information linked publicly
with this domain name, consider adding
Private Registration to your registration.
The standard option that GoDaddy.com offers is a two year registration. If you only want to reserve the name
for one year, be sure to change the Registration Length by clicking the drop-down box and picking the 1 Year
option.

After you pick all your options, you see the
Secure Checkout screen and are asked to enter
your billing information to confirm the order. Go
through the Registration Agreement and Terms

Using WHOIS to Find a Domain Owner
Let’s say that you find the domain name of your dreams. For this 
example, I use www.realecommercesales.com; this is the name 
you believe takes your Web store to the next level. You have to have it.
But when you go to register it, the registrar tells you that the name is
unavailable! What do you do? Typically, the first response is to type the
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or Web address into a Web browser
and see if contact information is available.
In many cases, you see a parked page. When someone signs up for a
domain name but he doesn’t have a Web site created for that domain
name, he usually creates one page to hold the space until the Web site is
created. Typically, these parked pages contain advertisements so the
domain holder can
make some money if
people click the ads
or links to move on,
as shown in the
figure. However,
there’s usually no
contact information
or e-mail address
to contact the
owner(s). Thankfully,
most domain names
have a public record
that you can access
for free to contact
the owner.

her registration private, and therefore, the
WHOIS results page has no helpful information.
(Think of it as someone who has an unlisted
telephone number.) In most cases, you see that
the registration information is public — you get
a mailing address, e-mail address, and (some-
times) a phone number for the person who reg-
istered the name. Simply scroll down past any
disclaimer information from the registrar used
to reserve the domain in question. (In this
case, the text is from GoDaddy.com.)
2.
Click the WHOIS link from the home page. This
takes you to the WHOIS search page. From
here, you can either search by the domain
name itself, by the NIC handle (a username
some domain name owners have created
through Network Solutions), or by a specific
IP address.
3.
Type the name of the URL you’re researching in the text box provided.
You do not need to put the initial www. before the URL name. Simply
put the name and extension (in this case, realecommercesales.com)
in the box and click the green Search button.

Scroll down farther to get the Administrative
and Technical Contact information. While you
scroll down the page, notice several pieces of
information. The first section of data contains
the Registrant information. This information is
tied to the person who owns the domain and
paid to have it registered in the first place. The
person listed under Registrant is considered
the legal owner of the domain name. However,
when you scroll down past the Registrant sec-
tion, notice other information associated with
the domain name record. A domain can have a
different person as the Administrative Contact
and yet another person as the Technical
Contact. Specifically, you’re looking for the
information listed in the following table.
Result Screen Information

Description
Registered 
In this section, focus on the Expires On date. This is the date that 
Through
marks the end of the Registrant’s subscription to the domain name.
If the Registrant chooses not to extend or renew his contract to this
domain name, you could come in and register the name for yourself!
Administrative 
This is the person who receives notices from the domain name registrar
Contact
about any questions the registrar has. Sometimes, the Administrative
Contact is the same as the Registrant, other times it isn’t. The best
person to present with an initial offer for the domain is the
Administrative Contact.
Technical 
This is usually the person who links the domain to the Web server for 
Contact
your business, so it is usually someone who works for your storefront
provider. In this case, it points to GoDaddy.com, who is handling the
technical aspects for this domain name because the parked page for
this domain also sits on their site. If you can’t contact anyone in the
Registrant or Administrative Contact sections, you can always try to
reach the owner through his Technical Contact.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Researching Other Domain Name Options
You’ve probably heard the expression “What’s in a name?” For a store owner, a recog-
nizable and easy-to-remember name can be critical to future growth. If you’re spending
most of your time trying to remind customers how to spell the precise name of your
Web store or the URL is so long it doesn’t fit on your business cards, you may want to
look at other options. Here are some different methods you can use to see what
domain names are for sale or what different domain extensions you can try:

Look for domain names on sale at various domain name resellers: There’s
a business market of people who purchased domain names specifically to
resell those names to companies who will use them properly. Think of it as
the World Wide Web name grab, like the land grab of the Wild Wild West. By
going to these resellers, you can estimate the value of certain names, and
perhaps get the idea of which domain best suits you, and probably figure
out which domain most fits your budget.
Some of the values that you see for these domain names have been created
purely by the seller as their goal. Any appraisal doesn’t automatically mean
that the domain is worth that much on the open market. The domain name
has to lend value to your Web store in order for you to pay for it. Remember
that principle if you see a domain name you like but that may be too highly
priced . . . and never be afraid to negotiate!
Some of the leading domain name resellers include
• AfterNIC (www.afternic.com)
• OnDomains (www.ondomains.com/sales.htm)
• The Domain Name Aftermarket (www.tdnam.com)
• DOTCOM Agency (www.dotcomagency.com)
Say that you want to build a Web store for exercise equipment, but you
can’t find a domain name that you think is sufficient. You can go to one of
these sites and see what names are up for sale. For example, you can go to
AfterNIC (as shown in the figure) and see all the domains they have for sale.

61
Chapter 3: Finding Your Storefront Provider
If you want to get more specific, you can click the Health subcategory, for
example, and get a more focused list of domains, as shown in the figure. You
can click any of the domain names listed to read more about their asking
price and offers. You can also use the search box at the top of the page to
type the keywords you want for your domain, which in this figure is exercise
equipment.
When you do that, you get a list of suggestions that match your keywords
and their database of names, as in the figure. You can go through the list,
see which domain names you like, and make offers on the names you want
to purchase. You can also type different keywords or start with one key-
word to get more selections.

62
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Let’s say that you have tons of sources for getting used exercise equipment at
a cut-rate price, and you want to be known as the Used Exercise Equipment
store. If you look at the list in the figure, you’ll see that usedexercise
equipment.com is available. Click the URL to see detailed information
about it and what these resellers feel is the market value for the name. You
can make an offer, but the minimum offer for this particular domain name
is $5,000.
If you make an offer and it’s accepted, the domain name reseller coordinates
the legal exchange and lists you as the Registrant for the domain name.
From there, you can assign your own Administrative and Technical Contact
and do what you wish for that name.

Try different extension names for your domain: When it comes to domain
names, .com is still considered the gold standard for commerce, and it’s the
first extension that people think of when it comes to e-commerce. However,
a growing list of other extensions can be used for e-commerce purposes as
well. Some people have heard of the .net extension, and the .org is typi-
cally for non-profit organizations, though sites like Craigslist and the U.S.
Postal Service actively use the .org extension. The .tv and .us extensions
are growing in popularity, but most of these extensions are rarely used. If
yourname.com is taken, consider some of these other options:
• yourname.net
• yourname.mobi
• yourname.biz
• yourname.tv
• yourname.org
• yourname.us
• yourname.info
• yourname.bz
• yourname.name
• yourname.cc

63
Chapter 3: Finding Your Storefront Provider
You can back order your domain in case it becomes available: Even
though you’re the owner of the domain name, you have to pay a yearly fee
to keep your domain name. Many people have signed up for a domain name,
found no use for the name, and let their registration expire. So, if you want
to wait until the registration has expired, you could then sign up for that
domain name with your new registration.
The domain name registrars saw a new stream of revenue by providing a
service where they’d watch the domain name registrations, and if a particular
name has expired without being renewed, the registrar would automatically
register the person who back ordered the name. Back order reflects the fact
that you’re placing an order for something that may become available in the
future.
If you’re going to back order a domain name, do your research with WHOIS
(see the preceding section) and try to back order the domain name with the
same  registrar that currently registered the domain name. This way, your
back order doesn’t have to check external databases every day for the expi-
ration date.

Invent an entirely new name or concept for your store domain name:
No one had ever heard of Google, Yahoo!, or eBay before the Internet craze
made these companies household names. Therefore, maybe your store will
want to take an avant-garde look and create a unique name, which you
could turn into your own brand.
Web sites are out there to help you. MakeWords.com (as shown in the
figure) is an example of a Web site that offers name generators based on
rules or keywords that you give it. MakeWords.com tells you whether its
newly generated names are available for registration or whether you have
to approach the owners, using methods like the ones we discussed earlier.

64
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 

Go long (with hyphens, extra words, and numbers): Yes, we all want the
short and sweet domain name that’s easy to remember, easy to spell, quick
to type, and reinforces your core product. However, with so many domain
names being registered every day, the newest trend is to go for the longer
domain names because you’re allowed to use letters, numbers, and the
dash (-) character. The domain name can be up to 63 characters long,
which gives you some options:
• Put dashes between the keywords in your desired domain name.
Although yourname.com may be taken, try your-name.com.
You can’t start or end your domain name with a dash, but the dash can
go anywhere else in your name, and you can use multiple dashes in your
name as well.
• Add an extra word or two to the end of your domain name. Instead of
yourname.com, try yournamecompany.com, yournamebusiness.com,
yournamesales.com, and so on.
• Use numbers to create variations of your desired domain name.
Instead of yourname.com, try 1yourname.com, 4yourname.com,
8yourname.com, 1your4name.com, and so on.
• Use a combination of the above techniques to create a name that
may be long, but have well-defined keywords. (An example of this is 
this-is-a-really-long-1-Web-store-name.com.) As I discuss
in Chapter 19, well-defined keywords help your store get better search
engine results.
In Chapter 4–6, I create three different example storefronts, complete with step-by-
step instructions. The three different Web storefront providers I use are Yahoo!
Merchant Solutions (http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com), ProStores (www.
prostores.com), and 1&1 eShops (http://1and1.com). These example store-
fronts are meant as illustrative only, as many providers work in a similar way. But
if you choose one of these three Web storefront providers, you’ll get the specific
how-to on storefront creation.

T
he first Web store we’re creating involves one of the oldest
and widely known providers of Web stores, namely Yahoo!.
Specifically, it’s Yahoo! Small Business, which offers different
Merchant Solutions based on the size and sales volume of the
store you wish to create. They’ve been in business for over a
decade and have created several levels of storefronts that are full
of helpful advice, from the telephone consultants available during
the first 60 days, to the hundreds of pre-programmed templates
you can use to instantly construct a slick store design, to the addi-
tional functionality, reports, and e-mail marketing tools that Yahoo!
offers its customers based on the fact that Yahoo! represents so
many e-commerce storefronts.
According to market studies that Yahoo! generated a few years ago,
approximately one out of every eight e-commerce Web sites was
using Yahoo! to power their site. Although I’m not sure how many
customers Yahoo! has today, Yahoo! Small Business clearly powers
thousands of merchants with its easy setup, stable environment,
and feature-rich Web storefronts. A quick look at the featured
Customer Stores (see Figure 4-1) shows a variety of clients, 
including the Lance Armstrong Foundation!
In this chapter, I start from the beginning: You’ll sign up for a Merchant Solutions
account, configure the account for your new Web store, pick a store design, add
at least one inventory item, and complete Yahoo!’s handy checklist for opening a
Web store.
Because Yahoo! offers a lot of benefits too numerous to mention in one chapter, a
good companion book to this one (if you choose Yahoo! to host your storefront) is
Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies by Rob Snell (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
This chapter gives you the core set of instructions to get up and running with Yahoo!
Small Business Merchant Solutions. There are a lot of extra functions you should
take advantage of when building and operating your Yahoo! store, some of which 
are covered in other chapters. Just remember to log in to your account and go to the
appropriate Control Panel when needed.

Why Yahoo?
Before I get into the step-by-step instructions, I talk about some of the benefits that a
Yahoo! storefront can provide you. Here’s some qualities of Yahoo!’s accounts, which
I discuss in Chapter 3, and how they apply to you:

Shopping Cart technology — Check!
• You can add an unlimited number of products to the shopping cart,
including information products for digital download.
• You can manage up to 50,000 different products.

67
Chapter 4: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
• Customer information is stored in your system based on their Yahoo! ID.
• Yahoo! integrates with PayPal or your own Merchant account (via Chase
Paymentech) with no additional gateway fee, and built-in verification
tools are provided to double-check the customer’s payment information.
• Orders can be transmitted via e-mail and, for Yahoo’s Standard or
Professional level accounts, via fax.
• It’s very easy to set up! Phone and online support are available.

Disk space and bandwidth — Check!
• Each Yahoo! store comes with at least 20 GB of disk space per store,
which is enough for tens of thousands of product pictures and
descriptions.
• The 500 GB data transfer limit means that tens of thousands of visitors
can be browsing your Web store at the same time!
• Yahoo! has the capability to add extra disk space, bandwidth, or data
transfer whenever needed.
• Yahoo! just unveiled unlimited storage for their e-mail accounts, so I sus-
pect disk space will not be an issue for their storefront customers.

E-mail accounts — Check!
• Yahoo! offers each store owner up to 1,000 unique e-mail addresses.
• Each e-mail account has an unlimited amount of storage space.
• People can access their e-mail through a POP (Post Office Protocol) or
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) service, or through Yahoo!’s
WebMail service at mail.yahoo.com.
• Each account comes with Norton AntiVirus screening and SpamGuard
Plus protection.

Programming extensions — Check!
• Yahoo! supports Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe GoLive, and Microsoft
FrontPage to help you build custom Web stores as well as a special
Dreamweaver extension that works directly with your stored product
information.
• Yahoo! has built-in support for programming languages and databases,
like Perl, PHP (Hypertext PreProcessor programming language), and
MySQL.
• Yahoo! has hundreds of templates available and an extensive dealer net-
work of third-party providers to help you build any additional functional-
ity that you need or want.
• Application integration — Check!
• Yahoo! has a built-in exporting tool to send transaction information to
QuickBooks for your accountant.
• Yahoo! can integrate with OrderMotion for order management and
fulfillment.

68
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
• Yahoo’s Order Manager can export orders into UPS WorldShip for easy
label creation and shipment tracking.
• Yahoo! works with Chase Paymentech to coordinate payments going into
your credit card Merchant account.
• Yahoo! integrates with Stone Edge Order Management software to coordi-
nate inventory management and order fulfillment.

Additional features — Check!
• Yahoo! runs their storefront accounts by using the FreeBSD (UNIX) com-
puter system with Apache servers, which are considered among the
most popular and stable in the industry.
• Yahoo! offers up to 40 reports and graphs to show everything from
customer and order information to the actual path of Web pages each
customer sees when he uses your Web site (known as customer naviga-
tion paths) and the most frequently searched topics in your store.
• Yahoo! offers Inventory alerts — you get automatic e-mails if any product
inventory falls below a certain level.

Security, reliability, and service —Check!
• Yahoo! supports Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with 128-bit
encryption to keep your customers’ information private.
• Yahoo! has customizable risk tools to help you identify fraud in your
orders before the products are shipped out and to help keep out
unwanted visitors from bringing down your Web store.
• Yahoo! reports that their servers had 99.9 percent uptime from mid-2005
to mid-2006 for their store servers — their stores were almost always on
and available!
• Yahoo! backs up your Web store automatically every day (locally and at a
remote site) and allows you to easily switch between older and newer
versions of your account. If you accidentally lose data, Yahoo! can help
you restore the most recent version quickly.
• Yahoo! has a 24/7 toll-free phone and an e-mail support hotline, along
with the first 60 days free support via telephone with a store specialist to
help build your store. Large customers (over $500,000/year) may qualify
for their own account manager.
• Yahoo! has built an extensive online help section (http://help.yahoo.
com/help/us/store/) with a Getting Started guide plus built-in tutorials
on basic and advanced topics.
Yahoo! Account Types
Yahoo! offers three basic account plans, all of which come equipped with a very
strong foundation for building your Web store. Yahoo! has created a plan comparison
chart (see Figure 4-2) so you can compare costs and benefits of each plan.

69
Chapter 4: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
Figure 4-2: Use this chart to find the right Yahoo! plan for your Web store.
Starter
At the core, every account offered by Yahoo! has the features and tools of the Starter
account. This includes the shopping cart that supports up to 50,000 products easily,
the templates, the customer service, and the marketing program discounts to help
you build and grow your business as well as basic reports to gauge your success.

70
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
For the Web store I create in this chapter, I select a Starter account. Unless you’re a
big, established retailer or you’re planning a major presence to open your Web 
store, the Starter account is more than enough to handle your needs. You can always
upgrade your account later, so use the Starter account to get your Web store up and
running.
The cost of the Starter account includes a $50 setup fee, a $39.95 monthly fee, and a
1.5 percent transaction fee based on sales volume every month. Yahoo! recommends
that after you reach $12,000 in monthly sales, upgrade to a Standard account
because of the lower transaction fee in that package.
Standard
After you achieve at least $12,000 in monthly sales or you have a need for additional
functionality, upgrade to a Standard account. This account takes the basic features
of the Starter account and adds more advanced features to help you run your grow-
ing business more smoothly.
You can expect to receive these benefits by upgrading to Standard:

Orders can be automatically faxed to you as well as e-mailed. (With Starter,
it’s e-mail only.)

Your databases have real-time access to your order data.

You can use UPS WorldShip to coordinate your shipments and package
labels.

You receive advanced reports, showing paths taken by customers and fre-
quently used search terms.

You can create and distribute special Web links to have your own affiliate
program with other resellers.

You can offer the use of electronic coupons and gift certificates on your
Web store.

You can specify cross-selling opportunities for each product in your catalog.
The cost of the Standard account includes a $50 setup fee (waived if you’re upgrad-
ing from Starter), a $99.95 monthly fee, and a 1 percent transaction fee based on
sales volume every month. Yahoo! recommends that after you reach $80,000 in
monthly sales, you upgrade to the Professional account because of the lower 
transaction fee in that package.
Professional
When Web stores exploded in popularity and sales, Yahoo! had to offer bigger 
packages to handle the growing needs of these now-large e-commerce merchants.
Therefore, the Professional package was born, focusing more on the scalability

Special Promotions: Get that Setup Fee Waived!
As of this book’s writing, Yahoo!’s offering
several promotions for new customers of
their Merchant Solutions accounts. You
might want to try one of these avenues first
before signing up:

Chapter 7 for detailed instructions on 
how to do this.) After you log out of your
PayPal account, scroll down to the bottom

offered is reflected in the prices displayed.
needs of a large merchant than the functionality. This means that Yahoo!’s servers
act quickly to provide additional disk space, bandwidth, data transfer, and other
backend services to keep the Web site running through busy, peak demand times.
The features and benefits of this account are similar to the Standard package, but
the transaction fee is lower.
The cost of the Professional account includes a $50 setup fee (waived if you’re
upgrading from Starter or Standard), a $299.95 monthly fee, and a 0.75 percent trans-
action fee based on sales volume every month. At this point, you have Yahoo!’s high-
est package and best deal as far as sales transaction volume goes.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
The four main aspects of your account are as follows:

Store Control Panel: You click this link when you want to design,
build, and manage your actual Web store. I use this link later.

Web Hosting Control Panel: You click this link to alter any aspects of
the Web hosting space you now own and to see your available space
left on the account. You also click this link to get the SiteBuilder tool
for a custom design of your Web site and to activate the blogging 
capabilities of your Web store.

Domain Control Panel: You click this link to handle any administrative
aspects of your custom domain name. If you ever need to add addi-
tional URL domain names, re-direct any other domain names, or create
subdomains for your Web site, start here.

E-mail Control Panel: As I mention in the section, “Yahoo! Account
Types,” earlier in this chapter, you get up to 1,000 different e-mail
accounts with your package. Click this link to create and manage 
your business e-mail accounts as well as to establish a catchall e-mail
address, which receives any message addressed to your domain name
but not to a specific user.
In this section, I concentrate on the Store Control Panel functions. First, you
need to create a design for your new Web store:

77
Chapter 4: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
4.
Click the Design Your Site button to get started.
After you click the button, you’re asked to select
either a generic template or a pre-defined tem-
plate for your store. If you have a very specific
color scheme in mind for your store and you
already have many of the images for your store
design, select the generic template so you can
insert your colors and pictures when needed.
Otherwise, a pre-designed template provides
your layout and matching color scheme, along
with lots of pre-defined images you can use within
your store without worrying about copyright
infringement or paying a graphic designer thou-
sands of dollars for your unique look. For your
purposes, I select the pre-designed template.
3.
Click the Design Your Site link to go to the Store
Editor. When you click the link, you’re taken to
the Design Your Site overview page (expect to
see one of these overview pages for each step in
the process). This page lets you know of any
requirements you need before getting started
and an estimated time for completion.
2.
Click the Store Control Panel link
to start your Open for Business
checklist. When you first sign up
for Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, you
see a five-part checklist that walks
you through the process of opening
a store. After you complete every
step, your store is published on
the Internet and ready for your
customers!
1.
Log in to your account and go to your main control panel. (Refer to the figure earlier.)

78
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
5.
After clicking the Pre-Designed Templates
button, review the various templates available
and click the Select Template button when
you’ve decided on one. At press time, 12 differ-
ent pre-designed templates are available for
your Web store. You can always customize a
template after you select one, so don’t think
you’re forced to adopt the entire template.
Each template is displayed with a paragraph of
notes, an example of the home page, and the
author who designed it. You can move between
templates by clicking the thumbnail of another
template from the blue Select a Template box
at the top of the page.
6.
After you pick your template, Yahoo! asks you to design your site header by either pro-
viding your store name or logo. At this stage, you’re presented with two choices (as
shown in the figure on the left) on how to proceed. If you’ve designed a company logo,
pick the radio button Upload Your Own Logo and follow the instructions to upload the
logo from your computer to Yahoo!’s servers. If you just want your store name stated
as the header, pick the radio button Use Plain Text and click Next to enter your store
title in the box provided (as shown in the figure on the right).
Read the product notes for each template because Yahoo! recommends different templates, depending on the
category of products you’re selling. For example, “Theme 1” is recommended for stores with multiple product
categories, like home and garden, sports and outdoors, toys and games, or health and beauty.These are only
suggestions, as most templates work fine for practically every store.

The last field to complete is the Copyright
Information field. You can simply substitute
your store name here with your store name in
the box provided to protect your store design
and text, or you can write your own Copyright
header, depending on the content you plan to
display in your Web store.

After you pick your header, click
the Next button, and Yahoo! pres-
ents a branding Web page asking
for some basic information to fill 
in your store template: your home
page message, your About Us con-
tact info and greeting, your Privacy
policy, and your Copyright infor-
mation. At this stage, you’re asked
to fill in several boxes that corre-
spond to different pages of your
Web store. Each section comes
with an illustration of where the
information will reside. You can
always go back and enter more
information later, but spending the
time now to write a quality intro-
duction saves you time down the
road when you’re close to opening
and have no time to write some-
thing fit for general consumption.
8.
When you scroll down the page, you see a box for your information. This includes any Shipping
policy, Return/Refund policy, and Frequently Asked Questions. See Chapter 2 for steps on how to
develop your own policies or use the standard text provided to create your own policies. After the
Information box, you’re asked to provide a Privacy page. See Chapter 2 for tips on building a Privacy
Policy, but note that Yahoo! gives you a template you can follow. Simply read through their text,
change some fields when prompted, and voilà!, your Privacy page is ready.
10. After you’re done, click the Finish button and you’re taken back to your Open for Business
checklist screen, with Step 1, Design Your Store, complete!

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Adding an Item to Your Store
You’ve created the outside look of your Web store through the Design
phase; now it’s time to fill the shelves by adding items, or products, to
your Web store.
Toolbox:
 Item or product names
 Item/product detailed
information (SKU, price,
cost)
 Item/product descriptions
 Item/product photos
Time Needed:

product
Stuff You 
Need to Know
2.
Click the Start Adding Products button to get
started. You’re taken to the first step of a 4-step
process to add a product to your store. In the
first step, you need to provide the product
information. This includes the product name,
description, picture, price, sales price (if appli-
cable), and the shipping weight. After you fill in
the basic information, click the Next button.
Although you could gather the elements you need during the Add process, if you plan on adding multiple prod-
ucts in one session you save time and effort by having everything ready beforehand with a list handy for review.
If you plan to add a lot of items, you may want to create a Comma Separated Values (CSV) text file of all your
products and upload them at once to your Yahoo! store. Click the Batch Upload link in the Advanced Users sec-
tion for more information on how to do this.
When inputting your product description, do not use the single quote mark (‘) because Yahoo! interprets that as
the end of your description. Every time you need to use a single quote, put two quotes (“) instead.

Click the Add
Products link on
your Open for

(Optional) You can define any product options.
This is designed for products that have multiple
options, like colors, sizes, or styles. You can
either define a general product, like a T-shirt,
and then define ordering options for that prod-
uct, like different sizes (S, M, L, XL) or colors
(red, blue, black, white, and so on), or you
can create specific product entries, like a blue L
T-shirt, a blue XL T-shirt, a red L T-shirt, and so
on. If you’re defining specific products with no
options, leave the I Do Not Need to Create
Options for This Product radio button selected.
If you leave this button selected, go straight to
Step 5.
4.
If you determine in Step 3 that you do want to offer dif-
ferent options, select the I Do Need to Create Options
for This Product radio button and click the Next button.
When you do that, you’re prompted with a blue pop-up
box to define your option. Give your option a name and
define your option in the fields provided. Click the 
+ Add Another Option Value button if you need to have
more than two options available. Click the I Need to
Make Price Changes for Each Option Value check box if
you have to charge more or less money based on the
option selected. For example, you may want to add $2
to the cost if someone orders an XXL T-shirt, instead of
a L or XL T-shirt. After you’re done with this option,
click the Create Option button. Repeat this process if
you want to create multiple options for this product;
after you’re done creating options, click the Next button
to proceed.

7.
Repeat Steps 2–6 for any additional products
you want to add to your store; click the Create
Another Product button to walk through the 
4-step process of adding another product to
your store (you can always return to this sec-
tion later through your Catalog Manager). Click
Finish when you’re done. After you create your
first product, you see a summary screen, show-
ing the default table of items in your new Web
store
6.
After you select your category, the final step is
to review all the information and either edit
your product info or submit it to your store.
You see a summary screen for your item; look
over the information and make sure everything
is correct, from the spelling, to the price, to the
category. You can make any changes by clicking
the Review and Edit link on the right side of the
screen. If everything looks good, click the Next
button to finalize your entry.
5.
After you have (or haven’t) created any product options, you must assign your product
to a store category. Every product in your store should be associated with a store cate-
gory. In the beginning, you have one default Home category for your products (as
shown in the figure on the left). You can create a product category by clicking the blue
+ Create Category button and completing the Category Name and Category Description
(as shown in the figure on the right). After you create a category, Yahoo! assigns your
product to that category. You can repeat this process to create all your categories and
then select the category for your product. Note: Each product can only belong to one
category or sub-category.

Chapter 4: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
Completing the Open for Business Checklist
You’ve designed your store template and added products that are avail-
able for sale. Think you’re finished? Not quite — Yahoo! has a few more
steps for you to complete before you can open your virtual doors, like
establishing payment methods, tax information, and shipping methods
and rates for your products.

2.
Click the Set Up My First Payment Method
button. You’re taken to a screen where you’re
asked if you’re currently able to collect payments
electronically. If you aren’t currently able to col-
lect payments electronically, select the No option
and click the Next button (if you are able to cur-
rently collect payments electronically, skip ahead
to Step 3). You’re taken to an options screen that
asks you if you want to sign up your Merchant
account through Chase Paymentech, use a PayPal
Merchant Solutions account, or use PayPal
Express with a regular PayPal account and have
your purchases processed on PayPal’s Web site
instead of your own. Consult the table for the
processes to set up these accounts. To find out
more about the accounts and how they compare
to each other, click the blue How Are They
Different button.
1.
Click the Payment Methods link on your Open
for Business checklist. You’re taken to the
Payment Methods overview screen. Because
Yahoo! doesn’t own a partner that can handle
credit card transactions, they rely on you to
go out and get at least one company that can
act as your payment processor. Therefore,
you may need to skip to Chapter 7 and find
out how to join PayPal or set up your own
Merchant account for credit card purchases.
After you’ve set up at least one account, come
back here and continue with the steps.

84
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Online Payment Method
Account Type
Process
Merchant account
Pull out your account information, select Chase Paymentech
from the Accept Credit Cards Directly on My Website with a
Merchant Account section, and click the Next button. You’re
given specific instructions on what information to give your
bank and what information to ask for in order to create a link
to your Yahoo! Web store. Warning: Allow a few days for the
Merchant account process to complete. Your bank has to
add the information about Yahoo! Merchant Solutions and
create a special ID that Yahoo! and Chase uses to charge
your customers’ orders through your Merchant account.
PayPal Web sites Payments 
Select PayPal from the Accept Credit Cards Directly 
account
on My Website with a Merchant Account section and follow
the instructions to link up that account with your Web store.
PayPal Premier or Business 
If you’ve created a PayPal Premier or Business account
account to handle payments (like getting paid for eBay auc-
tions), but haven’t applied for the Web site Payments pro-
gram, select the Accept Credit Card and PayPal Payments 
on the PayPal Web site (PayPal Express Checkout) radio
button and click the Next button. This is by far the easiest
process to set up so you can get going. You see a summary
screen that explains the process of completing this 
application.
3.
If you’ve already created a payment account, select the Yes option and then click the Next button to
input your specific account information. Yahoo! links to that account for your Web store so customers
are taken to the correct checkout page to pay you for their order. Depending on whether you’re using
PayPal or your own Merchant account, it takes up to a few business days to link the accounts.
4.
Repeat Steps 1–3 to add any additional payment methods to your store. Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
has a minimum of one payment method, but there’s no maximum. If you already have a Merchant
account and want to offer your customers a choice of going through your existing Merchant account
or your PayPal account, add both accounts to your store. Otherwise, one of these methods is suffi-
cient to run your customers’ credit cards.
5.
Now, you need to define your Tax Rate information. Click the Set Up Tax Rates link on your Open for
Business checklist. Here, Yahoo! recommends that you know the tax status of your business as well
as the states and accompanying tax rates for those states that you have to charge. Typically, if you’re
running a one-location home business for your Web store, you need only to charge sales tax for cus-
tomers in the same state as you, at the tax rate of the county you’re doing business in (which is usu-
ally the county where you reside).

6.
Click the Start Tax Wizard button and you’re
taken to the Tax Setting window. You’re asked
whether you need to collect sales tax online and
you have three options: I’m not required, I’m
required, or I’m not sure.
85
Chapter 4: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
7.
If you’re required to collect sales tax, select the
I am Required to Collect Tax on Taxable Goods
Purchased from My Online Store radio button
and then click the Next button. You’re asked to
create sales tax rules for each state where your
business operates. Yahoo! shows you a map of
the U.S. Simply click each state where you have
a physical business presence and you see your
state appear in the States Selected list on the
left. Then click the Next button to create the
rule for that state.
8.
Yahoo! automatically creates a rule for each state selected and shows you the base
formula it created (as shown in the figure on the left). If you need to update the rule
created, simply click the Edit link next to that rule, and in the box provided (as shown
in the figure on the right), put in your business operations ZIP code and the correct
tax rate you have to charge and then click the Update button to save your changes.
You can click the blue Do I Need to Collect Tax? info link to read more about this issue.Also, you can consult
your state’s secretary of state’s Web site for more information on whether you need a reseller’s permit and/or tax
license.

86
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
10. Click the Start Shipping Wizard button. You’re
taken to the Shipping Rates window and asked if
you want to set up automatic rules with UPS or
set manual rates with any carrier. Yahoo!’s soft-
ware works directly with UPS and UPS Online —
UPS’s online shipping tool — so that if you pick
automatic rates, Yahoo! calculates a customer’s
shipping total based on the weight of the cus-
tomer’s order and the buyer’s ZIP code. The 
following table lists your options and the
process you follow to set them up.
9.
Finally, you need to set up your shipping meth-
ods and rates. Click the Set Up Shipping link on
your Open for Business checklist. Here, Yahoo!
recommends that you know your ship-from loca-
tion and the shipping company or companies
you plan to use in order to handle your pack-
ages before you complete this step.
Shipping Rates
Carrier
Process
UPS
If you plan on using UPS (either as your sole shipper or one of several
options), make sure the Calculate Rates Automatically Using UPS Real-
Time Rates option is selected and click the Next button. Yahoo! walks you
through the process of registering your business with UPS Online and link-
ing that account with your Yahoo! Web store.
Non-UPS
If you plan on using other carriers besides UPS or you don’t want to create
a UPS Online account, select the Manually Enter Rates option and click
the Next button. You’re taken to the Configure Shipping Methods screen
where you can either pick specific shipping methods from companies, like
UPS, FedEx, USPS, or DHL, or pick General Methods, like Ground, Express,
Air, Free Shipping, and In-Store Pickup. For each General Method that you
select, click the Add a Rate link next to that method to bring up the Enter a
Rate table. You can specify a Flat Rate for shipping, based on a Flat Rate
per order, per pound, and/or per item. You can also specify a Rate Table,
where you set levels for shipping amount based on weight, number of
items, or total dollar amount of the order.
If you want to assign Handling charges on top of your shipping amounts, select the Handling Charges check 
box on the Configure Shipping Methods screen and click the Add a Rate link next to it to finalize the handling
charges.You should recognize the boxes that come up; they look like the figures in Step 10 except these will be
added as Handling to the customer’s order, not as Shipping.

12. At this point, you’ve completed all the steps of
the Open for Business checklist. Your checklist
should have checkmarks for all the steps. After
that’s happened, click the View Site button to
create a test order so you can truly be open for
business!
11. After you’re done setting Shipping rules, click
the Next button to review the rules you created.
You see a screen detailing your rules. After
you’re satisfied, click the Finish button to save
your shipping rules.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 

T
he second Web store I’m creating involves a newer vendor cre-
ated and owned by eBay to appeal to their auction customers,
namely ProStores. This company offers a variety of small, medium, and
enterprise solutions based on the size and sales volume of the store
you wish to create. Although they’re initially designed to help augment
eBay sellers with their own e-commerce sites, ProStores has built a
robust platform to handle almost any e-commerce need, with or with-
out auctions on the side.
ProStores powers thousands of small, medium, and large merchants
with their easy setup, stable environment, and feature-rich Web store-
fronts. A quick look at their Featured Sites (as shown in Figure 5-1)
shows a variety of clients, including eGizmo.com!
In this chapter, I start from the beginning: You’ll sign up for a Business
account, configure the account for your new store, pick a store design,
add at least one inventory item, and complete their handy checklist for
opening a Web store.
Because ProStores offers a lot of benefits too numerous to mention in one chapter,
you can read about their different solutions at www.prostores.com/product-
information.shtml.

Why ProStores?
Before I get into the step-by-step instructions, I talk about some of the benefits that a
ProStores storefront can provide you. Look over the qualities of their accounts,
based on the discussion in Chapter 3, and how it applies to you:

Shopping Cart technology — Check!
• You can add at least 100,000 products to the shopping cart, including
information products for digital download.
• You can manage up to 100,000 different products, and if you need more
than that, you can e-mail ProStores Support about getting support for
that many products.

91
Chapter 5: ProStores
• Customer information is stored in your system based on your ProStores ID.
• ProStores integrates with PayPal or your own Merchant account, and
built-in verification tools are provided to double-check the customer’s
payment information.
• It’s very easy to set up! Phone and online support are available.

Disk space and bandwidth — Check!
• Each ProStores store comes with anywhere from 5 to 20 GB of disk space
per store, which is enough for tens of thousands of product pictures and
descriptions.
• The 50 to 400 GB data transfer limit means that thousands to tens of
thousands of visitors can be browsing your Web store at the same time!
• ProStores has the capability to add extra disk space, bandwidth, or data
transfer whenever needed but recommends upgrading your account if
you regularly exceed your monthly limit as stated in your package
description.

E-mail accounts — Check!
• ProStores offers each store owner anywhere from 50 to 200 unique e-mail
addresses.
• Each e-mail account has a generous limit, based on the level of account
you ordered. Business accounts have a 1 GB limit per account.
• People can access their e-mail through a POP (Post Office Protocol) or
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) service, or through ProStores’s
WebMail service at www.webmail.prostores.com.

Programming extensions — Check!
• ProStores supports Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft FrontPage to 
help you build custom Web stores, as well as a special Dreamweaver
Extension that works directly with your stored product information.
• ProStores has built-in support for features, like Flash and MP3s.
• ProStores has hundreds of templates available and a Design Services
team to help you build any additional functionality that you need or
want.

Application integration — Check!

QuickBooks for your accountant.
• The ProStores Order Manager can integrate with UPS, FedEx, USPS, and
Canada Post for easy shipments.
• ProStores works with PayPal or your merchant gateway to coordinate
payments going into your credit card Merchant account.

92
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 

Additional features — Check!
• ProStores offers over a dozen reports and graphs to show everything
from customer and order information to the actual path of Web pages
each customer sees when they use your Web site (known as customer
navigation paths) and the most frequently searched topics in your store.
• ProStores offers daily submission to the popular shopping search
engines, including Yahoo! Shopping, Shopping.com, Shopzilla, and
Froogle.

Security, reliability, and service — Check!
• ProStores supports Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with 128-bit
encryption to keep your customers’ information private.
• ProStores also has customizable risk tools to help you identify fraud in
your orders before the products are shipped out and to help keep out
unwanted visitors from bringing down your Web store.
• ProStores backs up your Web store automatically every day (locally 
and at a remote site) and allows you to easily switch between older and
newer versions of your account. If you accidentally lose data, ProStores
can help you restore the most recent version quickly.
• ProStores has a 24/7 toll-free technical support hotline (1-800-422-9213), 
a toll-free General support hotline open Monday–Friday, 9am–10pm EST
(1-800-422-9213), and initial support via telephone to help start your
account (1-866-747-3229).
• ProStores has built an extensive online help section (http://kb.
prostores.com) with a Getting Started Guide, plus built-in tutorials 
on basic and advanced topics.
ProStores’ Plan Types
ProStores offers three basic plans plus one Express plan. The four plans offer you a
wide range of options, depending on the size of the Web store you wish to create,
and the features you want to take advantage of when building and running your
store. Take a look through each description and see which plan is closest to your
goals. Remember, you can always upgrade your package as your Web store grows!
Express
This option is perfect for the beginning merchant, as this plan allows you to sell up
to 10 unique products through a customizable storefront for only $6.95 per month,
plus 1.50% of any gross merchandise sales through your store every month.

93
Chapter 5: ProStores
Business
This option is the best all-around solution for a new Web store merchant, as it pro-
vides the powerful shopping cart that can easily handle up to 100,000 products,
giving you unlimited possibilities for creating a functional Web store. It comes with
ample hosting space, data transfer capabilities, as well as a core set of templates,
reports, and features to help you build and grow your store. This solution costs
$29.95 per month, plus 0.50% of any gross merchandise sales per month.
Advanced
This solution is designed for the small to medium retail operation that wants to grow
its online arm through a variety of marketing and merchandising options. This solu-
tion contains the Business package for hosting lots of products but gives you more
options for inventory management, promotion, merchandising, and payment fea-
tures. This solution is for you if you plan on selling downloadable products or want
to offer storewide sales and promotion codes to your customers. This solution costs
$74.95 per month, plus 0.50% of any gross merchandise sales per month.
Enterprise
This solution is designed for the medium to large enterprise customer that wants to

age allows you to add drop-shipping capabilities, create affiliate marketing tools so

tively. This solution costs $249.95 per month, plus 0.50% of any gross merchandise

After 5–10 seconds, the screen refreshes and
asks if you’re an eBay user. Typically, eBay Store
owners get 30 percent off their monthly sub-
scription fee to ProStores while they maintain
an eBay store. If you have an eBay store, follow
the prompts to validate your eBay user ID. If
you don’t have an eBay store (even if you have
an eBay account), click No to proceed with the
signup process.

If your name is available, you see a message similar to the one in the figure on the left.
If your name is not available, ProStores shows you another message similar to the one
in the figure on the right. In that case, ProStores gives you other options of similar
names that are available for purchase. Even if your name is available, ProStores
prompts you for different extensions of your domain name, like .net, .org, .biz, and
.info. If you want to completely start over, scroll down the page and click the Search
Again for a New Domain Name . . . link to go back to Step 3 to enter a brand-new name.
If your first choice for a domain name isn’t available, go to Chapter 3 and research
other methods of obtaining a good domain name for your store.
3.
Next, you’re asked to create your own domain
name or transfer an existing domain name that
you’ve purchased already. We are now in Phase 2
of the ProStores store creation process —
Domain Name. As you can see, you simply pick
the radio button to either search for a new
domain name or transfer your existing name.
ProStores does give you a third option of using
a shared domain name for your store, essen-
tially offering a URL like http://store.
prostores.com/yourstorename. This strat-
egy is not wise if you’re trying to build your 
own identity because you’re now dependent on
ProStores and will lose this name if you ever use
another storefront provider.
5.
After you select an available domain name, click
the Continue button to move to Phase 3 —
Store Name. ProStores gives you up to 50 char-
acters for your Store Name, which is used when
you build your Web store. You can always
change your store name after you’ve signed up
with ProStores. The key with the Store Name is
to reinforce the keywords your store repre-
sents. So, don’t just think about using your
domain name, like Roadside Treats, but be more
descriptive: Roadside Treats — Snack Foods &
Tasty Desserts.

Click the Checkout button to proceed to 
Phase 5 — Create Your Account — and enter
your contact information. Every field with an *
is a required field, so you can leave any
optional field blank (such as Fax). If your con-
tact information matches your credit card
billing address, save yourself the hassle of
retyping the same information in Phase 6 —

question Is This Your Credit Card Billing
Address?

After you create your name, click the Continue
button to review your Account Preferences and
set up your account. In Phase 4 — Account

choice of accounts you made and to show your

ProStores is offering a free one-month subscrip-
tion for new users, so you pay $0 upfront and
pay only your monthly fee, starting your second
month.
8.
After entering your Contact Information,
ProStores needs your Billing Information in
Phase 6. In this screen, you’re asked to put a
major credit card on file for your ProStores
account. If your billing address for your credit
card is different from the contact information
you gave in Step 7, adjust the address informa-
tion on the right side of this screen. Be sure to
review the Terms and Conditions before clicking

However, just because an item has a checkmark
next to it does not mean the item is fully com-

sage that your theme has been saved to your
account. You should see your theme reflected
in the appropriate box.
3.
The ProStores Theme page appears. Currently, over 300 themes are available for you
to select, but initially, ProStores brings up its Favorites category (as shown in the
figure on the left). You can look through the different themes by clicking the Theme
Category drop-down box near the middle of the screen and reviewing the different cat-
egories of themes that are offered (shown in the figure on the right). Read the descrip-
tions of each theme to understand where your pictures are placed on the screen and
what resolution is optimal for that theme. Pick a theme that you feel reflects the tone
and quality of the Web store you wish to offer — if you’re offering fun, entertainment
products, you can pick something with eye-popping colors. Plenty of options are tai-
lored to specific niches, like children’s apparel, home and garden items, and even serv-
ices, like legal and accounting.

After you decide your logo, you should decide
how you want your home page layout to be set.
Click the Change link next to Home Page Layout
row on your Store Design screen. As of this
writing, ProStores has to up to eight defined
layouts for your home page. After you click the
Change link, you see the eight defined layouts.
The key is to read each layout description to
see where the Welcome text and pictures will
appear on your page, as well as the location (if
any) of featured products and/or featured cate-
gories. You should have an idea of how many
important categories you wish to promote in
your store. It’s advisable not to try and sell too
much on the home page, but offer an avenue for
people to dig deeper to find the product they
want. If you know that your store has at least
one hot product that makes up a lot of your
sales, pick a home page layout that has at least
one featured item and/or category. After you
pick your Home Page Layout, click the Select
button and scroll down to the bottom of the
page to click the Save and Publish button. 
This saves your Home Page Layout to your
ProStores account. You’re then returned to the
Store Design page.
5.
Next, upload a logo or create a logo for your
Web store. If you already have a logo, click the
Change link next to the Logo row on your Store
Design screen in order to upload it onto your
Web store. You’ll see a page where you can click
the Browse button and upload your logo file
onto your account, or specify that you won’t be
using a logo for your store (you can always
come back later to add a logo to your store, if
you don’t have one ready yet). If you don’t have
a logo, ProStores account holders can receive
discounts from companies, like Logoworks or
Logomaster, to have them design a logo for you.
On the Store Design window, look for a promo-
tional ad featuring savings on your logo cre-
ation. You can also get a logo for only $99 by
going to LogoYes at www.logoyes.com.

8.
Finally, look at your Product Detail Layout. Click
the Change link next to that line item. Now that
you’ve decided how you want each product to
look when shown as a list, it’s time to pick a
layout for when a customer is examining one par-
ticular product. Similar to the last step, you see a
list of different product detail layouts. Currently,
you have five different choices for Product Detail
Layout, which offers you the ability to place the
image to the left of the text, to the right of the
text, above the text, or no image at all. After you
pick your Product Detail Layout, click the Select
button and scroll down to the bottom of the page
to click the Save and Publish button.
7.
Now look at your Product List Layout. Click the
Change link next to that line item. When your
customers browse through your product cate-
gories or search for something and see a result-
ing list of products, they see a list layout that
you can specify in this step. The idea is to pick
a layout that displays the right mix of product
images, category images (if you have them),
and product information. As of this writing,
ProStores offers 11 different layout options,
including 2- and 3-column approaches, a simple
table, and even alternating images to fill the
page appropriately. After you pick your product
layout, click that Select button and scroll down
to the bottom of the page to click the Save and
Publish button. This saves your Product List
Layout to your ProStores account and returns
you to the Store Design page.
9.
At this point, you’ve made decisions for all the
options necessary to build your ProStores Store
Design. You can always go into your Design set-
tings by clicking the Go to Design Settings link
on the Store Design window and making addi-
tional changes to your previous layout selec-
tions. Additionally, if you want to change your
font selections or make text changes to your
pages, click the Go to Design Settings link on
the Store Design window, scroll down the page,
and click the Change link for Fonts and Colors
and/or Page Text.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Adding Categories to Your Store
When you create your account with ProStores, typically it assigns 
you one default product category, entitled New, to put your items into
your store. In the Getting Started Checklist, it shows the Add Product
Categories item as Complete. However, most of you will have multiple
categories, and therefore, need to revisit this item before opening your
Web store. Don’t worry, adding multiple categories is easy!
1.
Once you are done with your store
design, from the left navigation bar,
click the Home link. A new Getting
Started sublink appears. Click the
Getting Started link to bring up the
store checklist. After you click the
“Add Product Categories” link from
the checklist, you see the Add
Product Categories Wizard. From
this screen, you can input your var-
ious categories and add them to
your store account.

To add a basic category, simply
type the name of the category in
the Category Name box and click
the Continue button. To add a
major category with subcategories
type the name of the category, a
colon (:), the name of the subcate-
gory in the Category Name box,
and then click the Continue button.
Regardless of whether you enter a
category or a category with a sub-
category, when you click Continue,
you see a screen confirming your
new category and asking you
whether you want to Add Another
Category, Continue On to Add
Products Wizard, or Return to
Getting Started Checklist. To create
another category, click the Add
Another Category link and repeat
this step for each additional cate-
gory you wish to add your store.
3.
When you’re finished adding the product categories for your Web store, click the Continue On to Add
Products Wizard link and proceed to the next task.
When adding product categories, try to write your initial product category list before you click the Continue On
to Add Products Wizard.This allows you to create an appropriate set of categories and subcategories.Although
you can always go back and refine your category list later, creating a proper list first and maintaining it is easier.

106
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Adding an Item to Your Catalog
If you’ve followed along so far, you’ve created the look and feel of your
store and defined your categories. Now it’s time to stock those shelves!
Rather, it’s time to add products to your catalog, so let’s get started.
You need to have your product photos and descriptions ready and
available before starting this step. Otherwise, if you try to create this
material while adding the item to your catalog, you’ll waste a lot of time
and perhaps create something incorrectly.
1.
From the Getting Started Checklist, click the Add Products item to
begin adding products to your store. If you clicked the Continue On
to Add Products Wizard link in the last step of the previous task,
you’re taken to the same spot — the Add Product Wizard.
2.
On the first screen of the Add Product Wizard,
input the name of your product, any stock-
keeping unit (SKU) number (optional), your
sales price for the item, the quantity you have in
stock, and whether you want this product visi-
ble to your customers and/or featured in your
store. Click the Continue button when you’re
done. Here, you’re defining the basic elements of
your product for sale. Remember, don’t put your
cost, but rather the sales price you want to get
for this product. You can use the UPC (Universal
Product Code) or SKU that comes with your
product, invent your own tracking system for
your products, or leave the SKU field blank.

In the next screen, you’re asked to create both a
Brief Description and Long Description for your
product. The Brief Description is used when 
customers are scanning a list of your products,
whereas the Long Description is displayed when
a customer is looking at the product detail page.
If you only have one description to use, you 
can put it in both fields. However, your Brief
Description should just have the basic info in 
a concise format. When you finish entering the
descriptions, click the Continue button.

107
Chapter 5: ProStores
4.
You now need to upload a photo (or photos) of
your product for sale. ProStores asks for both 
a thumbnail (or small) photo and the regular
photo image. In the Photo Image section, a
Generate Thumbnail from Product Image check
box (when checked) allows ProStores to gener-
ate a thumbnail photo for you based on the reg-
ular Photo Image that you upload. Therefore, if
you don’t have a thumbnail photo already, use
this option to have it supplied automatically. 
If you do this, you’re asked to create a small,
medium, or large thumbnail. Any of these are
fine, but take the default Medium if you’re not
sure. In order to upload either photo, click the
Browse button to open a window that searches
your computer for the photo. Navigate through
your computer’s directories until you find the
product photo and then double-click the name,
or click the name and then click the Open
button. Click the Continue button after specify-
ing your product photo locations. ProStores
uses the information you specified and starts
transferring the product photos from your com-
puter to their Web site after you click Continue.
5.
In the next screen (shown in the figure on the left), you need to assign a category for your product.
Click the Continue button when you’re done. Every time you create a new product, ProStores automat-
ically assigns it to a New category so your customers can find the newly added merchandise to your
store. However, you have the ability to assign the product to your own set of categories and even
remove the item from New if you choose. Look through the list of categories you created (you did this
in the previous task) and click the check box next to the category or subcategory where you wish to
assign the item. Then click the Assign button to activate this designation. You see that the item is now
assigned to both the New category and the subcategory you just assigned (shown in the figure on the
right). Depending on how detailed your category structure is and the product you’re adding, you may
have several category designations for one product so your customers can find it easier.

108
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
7.
In the next screen, define the keywords for your
product that are sent to the search engines. In
the previous step, we created keywords for your
customers to find the product when they were
on your Web site. Now, you’re defining search
terms that are used when people use the search
engines to find your Web store. You can repeat
the same keywords you used in the previous
step or pick the keywords that most appeal to
your customer market or are most desirable
compared to other keywords for your product.
For more information on how to optimize your
products for the search engines and how to
enter good values in this step, check out Search
Engine Optimization For Dummies, 2nd Edition,
by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
6.
(Optional) Define Product Search Keywords to
associate with your product. ProStores automat-
ically defines your product name, manufacturer,
category, and SKU as keywords for your prod-
uct, but chances are your product for sale has
additional keywords that customers use to find
it, and you can define those words in this step.
It’s completely optional, so if there are no key-
words, just click the Continue button and move
on. After you define these words, simply put a
space or comma between each keyword and
click the Continue button when you’re done.
8.
Create up to two attributes for your product.
Think of attributes as something about your
product that can be different for different users.
For T-shirts, size is an attribute; so you can
have small, medium, large, extra large, and so
on. Instead of defining each specific item in the
catalog (small T-shirt, medium T-shirt), you
simply define the product and then define the
attributes so customers can pick a product and
the specific attributes they need. If your prod-
ucts don’t have any attributes, meaning there is
only one version of the product you defined,
simply leave this entire screen blank. When
you’re done, click the Continue button.

109
Chapter 5: ProStores
10. You have now successfully added your product
to your catalog, and you should see a confirma-
tion screen. You should see the Product Name
and some of the summary details on this
screen. From this point, you can click the Add
another Product link and repeat the steps to
add more products to your catalog; you can
click the Continue On to Payment Preferences
Wizard link to go to the next step of the store
creation process; or you can click the Return to
Getting Started Checklist link to go back to the
Checklist and go over your steps so far.
9.
In the last input screen (shown in the figure on the left), you can assign a manufac-
turer to your product. When you open your ProStores account, your Manufacturer list
is empty, so you probably see only one option in the drop-down list: None. You have to
add a manufacturer before you can assign it to your product. Therefore, click the Add
a Manufacturer radio button and then click the Continue button. You’re taken to a
screen (shown in the figure on the right) where you can input your manufacturer name
and, optionally, the manufacturer’s Web site. After you do that, click the Continue
button to save the manufacturer. You’re taken back to the previous input screen, but
this time the drop-down list has the manufacturer name you just created. Pick the
manufacturer name and then click the Continue button to go to the Summary screen.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Completing the Getting Started Checklist
You have just completed the first four of the five required items for
opening your store on ProStores. The fifth item — Choose Payment
Options — was partially handled when you opened your account, if 
you specified a PayPal account that accepts credit cards for your store.
However, you should revisit this step, especially if you have a Merchant
credit card account that you want to handle your online customer
credit card payments.
1.
Click the Choose Payment Options link from the
Getting Started Checklist. You’re taken to the Payment
Preferences Wizard. If you clicked the Continue On to
Payment Preferences Wizard link in the last step of the
previous task, you’re taken directly to the Payment
Preferences Wizard. If you specified PayPal as a pay-
ment option when you created your account, you
should see the PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard check
boxes marked. If you plan on taking additional credit
cards, check the appropriate boxes. Additionally, if
you plan on letting your customers mail in checks or
money orders, be sure to check the Check/Money
Order check box, so your customers will have that
opportunity in the checkout process. After you make
your selections, click the Continue button.
2.
Decide which credit card options you want
applied to your store. There are several options
you can apply as rules when you accept credit
cards in your store. For example, you can
require the customer to provide credit card
information and choose to keep that informa-
tion after the order is processed. You can fur-
ther specify whether the customer has to reside
in the same country as your store or whether
the customer must give you a phone number
upon checkout. After you pick your options,
click the Continue button.

If you’re offering PayPal as your payment
processor (even if you’re offering others as
well), specify your PayPal address. In this step,
you’re asked for your PayPal e-mail address,
which is used to deposit money into your
PayPal account when a customer uses PayPal.
Make sure the e-mail address specified is the
one you use (or plan to use) for PayPal. When
you’re finished, click the Continue button.
3.
If you have a Merchant account, pick your
Gateway processor and click the Continue
button. If you plan on using your Merchant
account, pick your Gateway processor from the
list provided. If you have a Merchant account,
you’re asked to specify whether you use a Host
or Terminal to process your credit cards, and
whether your customers get Immediate fulfill-
ment (like with a digital download product or 
a subscription) or Future Fulfillment (when 
you ship physical products). Finally, you’re
asked for the Partner Name, your Merchant 
ID, and Merchant password for accessing your
Merchant account. If you’re not planning on
using a Merchant account, simply pick None
from the list and click the Continue button.
5.
Review your specified Payment Preference
options before moving onto the next phase. You
should see a confirmation/detail screen based
on your selections so far. Make sure that every-
thing is accurate. When you’re ready, you can
either click the Continue On to Upload Images
Wizard link or the Return to Getting Started
Checklist link. For this book’s purposes, click
the Return to Getting Started Checklist link.

7.
When you’re ready to upload pictures to your
Web site, click the Upload Images item in the
Recommended section. You’re asked which
images you want to upload to your Web store.
Pick the type of image you want to upload and
click the Continue button.
6.
You have now completed the Required section
of the Getting Started Checklist. Several items
are still in the Recommended and Optional sec-
tions. Therefore, I go through some of these
items, as most of you need to complete them.
8.
You need to specify whether you’re uploading 
a Zip file that contains multiple pictures, or a
single picture file. Then, you specify the image
(or Zip file) location on your computer so
ProStores can upload it. You see a screen where
you can specify the type of file you’re uploading,
and by clicking the Browse button, specify the
exact directory on your computer where the file
is located. Click the Continue button to upload
the file to your ProStores account.
9.
If you have any other images you need to send to your Web site, repeat
Steps 7 and 8 by clicking the Upload another Image link. You can always go
back later through the Support Manager and upload more images or pic-
tures to your Web site, but you should definitely upload any logos, prod-
uct photos, or category/manufacturer logos that you already have.
When uploading pictures to your Web site, if you picked a Product List Layout that involves Category photos, be
sure to upload category photos in this step.

11. Define how much mark-up you want to add to
your shipping price. Mark-Up is another word
for the handling charge necessary for you to
process your customer orders. Typically, this
amount is meant to cover the amount of sup-
plies (boxes, packing supplies, tape, and so on)
necessary for an average customer order as
well as the labor required to prepare and ship
an order, whether it’s by you or someone you
hire. When you look at this screen, you have a
few options. You can add $0.00 mark-up, assign
a percentage of the order as mark-up, or create
a fixed dollar amount mark-up regardless of
order size. After you decide on your mark-up
amount, click the Continue button.
10. From the image confirmation screen (or the
Getting Started Checklist), you can click the
Shipping Preferences link to set your shipping
preferences. You’re taken to the Shipping Setup
Wizard. The first question they have for you is
whether you want estimated shipping to show
up on your shopping cart. If you want this
option, check the box indicated. After you
decide, click the Continue button.
113
Chapter 5: ProStores
12. Define how your shipping costs are calculated
based on the order and customer address.
ProStores offers you several ways to calculate
the shipping charges based on a customer
order. As you can see, you can set your shipping
basis on either the Total Order Amount, Total
Order Weight, or Total Item Count (number of
items ordered). If you’re inputting weights of
each product, it’s highly recommended to base
your shipping charge on the actual weight of the
order. If the products are light and/or uniform
weight, you can probably calculate shipping
based on Total Item Count. If you only want
your customers to pay a percentage of their
order in shipping or you wish to help subsidize
their shipping based on their order size, select
Total Order Amount. In addition, you’re asked
whether your shipping should be calculated
based on the State/Province and/or Country of
your customer, or the Postal Code (ZIP code)
Range or Country of your customer. For more
exacting numbers, it’s recommended to select
Postal Code Range or Country option.

114
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
14. Confirm the shipping methods you’ve created.
You’re shown a summary of the shipping
method levels you just created. At this phase,
under the Shipping Levels section on the left
side of the screen, you can click the links to add,
modify, or delete a method. After you’re satis-
fied with the shipping levels you created, make
sure the Don’t Change Levels radio button is
selected and click the Continue button.
13. Define your actual shipping methods and give
them a name. You’re asked to define how many
different shipping methods you’ll offer your cus-
tomers. Additionally, you’re asked to give names
to your shipping methods. Many stores use this
opportunity to remind people of the shipping
company they use. For example, a merchant
may label Standard as USPS Media Mail 4–14
Days to remind their customers that if they pick
Standard shipping, it can take up to 2 weeks for
delivery. You have to define at least one shipping
method among Standard, Two Day, and Next
Day, but you don’t have to offer all three. Each
shipping method title can be only 25 characters
or fewer. You can also offer a Will Call or Local
Pickup option to your customers, if you wish. 
To add this as an option, select the Will Call
check box and give that shipping method title 
a descriptive name, like Local Pickup or Local
Delivery/Pickup to signify that the order isn’t
handled through the mail. Click the Continue
button after making your selections.

16. If you’ve followed along so far, you’ve now 
completed the Shipping Preferences Wizard. It’s
time to set up your Sales Tax Wizard. Click the
Continue On to Sales Tax Wizard link to quickly
set up your sales tax information. As of this
writing, you currently don’t have to collect sales
tax from any customers who live either outside
a state you do business in or outside the coun-
try where you do business. Therefore, you have
to collect sales tax only from customers who
live in the same state as your business, which is
what I set up here.
15. Set up your Shipping Zones. When you set up your ProStores account, it sets up one
default shipping zone as All Countries, with ZIP codes 00000 through 99999. You should
see the screen, like the one in the figure on the left, where you can add zones, modify
existing zones, or delete zones. In order to modify the default shipping zone, select
Modify and click the Continue button. Then, you’re taken to a screen like the one in the
figure on the right, where you can give a name to your shipping zone, define the coun-
try of your zone, and pick the postal code range of that zone. After you fill in all the
fields, click the Continue button to save your zone. After you’re done with setting up
your shipping zones, select the Don’t Make Any Changes option and click the Continue
button to finalize your shipping setup.

a calculator. Currently, your only option is the
ProStores calculator. Leave the selected one,

button.

116
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
19. Next, you have to create a tax region, where you’re required to collect sales tax. Go
ahead and click the Add a New Tax Region radio button, as shown in the figure on the
left. You’re taken to a screen, like the one in the figure on the right, where you put in
information about your state and fill in the tax rate for your specific state, county, dis-
trict, or city in the boxes provided. If your business has locations or operations in
more than one state, one county, or one city, create a unique tax zone for each location
because you’re required to collect sales tax for areas where you’re doing business.
When you’re done creating tax regions, pick the Don’t Change Tax Regions option and
click the Continue button.
18. Establish any tax categories. Decide whether
you have to set up special tax categories for
your products. If you have some products that
are taxable and others that are not taxable,
click the Add a New Tax Category radio button
and type a label on the next screen to signify
the different tax categories that represent your
products. If all your products fall into one cate-
gory or none of your products are taxable,
make sure the Don’t Change Tax Categories
radio button is selected. Click the Continue
button to move on.
20. ProStores asks if you want to calculate tax
based on where the package is going instead 
of the customer billing address. For most Web
stores, the transaction is technically occurring
between your base of operations and where
your online order is going, not necessarily the
billing address of your customer. Therefore, if
you don’t want to collect tax on any in-state
customers who are shipping their order out of
state, check the Use the Ship-To Address to
Calculate Tax, Instead of the Billing Address
check box and click the Continue button.

21. You’ve now completed the Sales Tax Preferences
Wizard — you’ve completed all the Required
and Recommended items for opening your
store. There are some Optional items about
e-mail preferences and linking your store with
your eBay account ID, but you can peruse those
at your own pace. When you’re ready to open
your store for business, click the Open Store
link. You’re either taken back to the Getting
Started Checklist, where it now says Your Store
is Open: [Close Store for Maintenance], or
you’re taken to your ProStores home page. You
did it! Of course, you still need to add more
products, make sure your store is exactly the
way you want it to look, and most importantly,
market your store as much as possible.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 

T
he final Web store I create involves a well-focused and low-
cost provider of different Web hosting packages, namely
1&1. Specifically, it’s 1&1 eShops (http://order.1and1.com,
as shown in Figure 6-1) that offers different e-commerce solutions
based on the size and sales volume of the store you wish to
create. They’ve been in business for a while now and have cre-
ated several levels of storefronts that have the basic elements as
well as some pre-programmed templates you can use to instantly
construct a solid store design and the additional functionality,
reports, and e-mail marketing tools that 1&1 can offer its cus-
tomers based on their size and expertise.
1&1 is an excellent example of an à la carte provider, where you
simply pay only for the elements you need and for each additional
feature that you plan on using. 1&1 offers Web hosting packages
as low as a few dollars a month, represents over six million users,
and has now become the world’s biggest Web host. Because of the
variety of packages that they offer, 1&1 can provide the right pack-
age for any skill set or budget.
They also partner with the world’s leading companies as well; 1&1
is an official Microsoft Joint Development Partner as well as a partner with Google,
HP/Compaq, Symantec, and Plesk.
In this chapter, I start from the beginning: You sign up for a 1&1 eShops account,
configure the account for your new store, pick a store design, add at least one inven-
tory item, and complete 1&1’s handy checklist for opening a Web store.

1&1 eShops’ Plan Types
1&1 offers three basic plans. You can see a comparison of features among these three
packages by going to their eShops overview at http://order.1and1.com/xml/
order/EshopsTariff (as shown in Figure 6-2).

123
Chapter 6: 1&1 eShops
Figure 6-2: Reviewing the different options of each plan.
Business eShop
This package is designed for the beginning Web merchant and offers a solid set of
features and capabilities to get anyone started, at an affordable price. You’re set up
with 50 MB of Web space and 10 GB monthly transfer rate, easy access to the 1&1
Control Panel to access your account, as well as a range of domain and hosting
tools, design templates, scripts, stock photos through Fotolia, the ability to add to
the Froogle product search, and e-mail and marketing capabilities.

124
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
This basic package runs $9.99 per month, plus the transaction cost associated with
processing credit card orders, typically a percentage of the order.
Professional eShop
This package is designed for the Web store owner that is looking to add more func-
tionality and capability beyond a traditional Web store. This package offers 300 MB
of Web space and 30 GB monthly transfer rate, gives the store owner the capability
to create up to 20 of his or her own product categories, offers a product search, and
imports and exports his or her inventory via text files. Professional eShop owners
have more payment-processing choices and access to a Tax Clearing server as well
as built-in support for multiple currencies. They also get features for logging and reg-
istering their customers who visit their Web store, and a handy newsletter tool for
keeping in touch regularly with their customers.
This package runs $29.99 per month, plus the transaction cost associated with pro-
cessing credit card orders, typically a percentage of the order.
Developer eShop
This package is designed for the Web store owner who wants to offer some leading-
edge functions to constantly stay in touch with her customers and provide a very
specific experience for her store. Not only do these store owners get 1,200 MB of
Web space and 60 GB monthly transfer rate, but they can create their own subdo-
mains within their site, enjoy FTP access to their account, have full customization
available when building their site, and can create automatic invoice and customer
numbers. Developer eShops can offer In2site Live Dialogue, which monitors your
customer’s activities and offers instant pop-up windows to communicate with visi-
tors while they’re visiting your site as well as pre-programmed greetings. Finally,
Developer eShops can offer flexible shipping calculations and group-specific dis-
counts to their Web store customers.
This package runs $49.99 per month, plus the transaction cost associated with pro-
cessing credit card orders, typically a percentage of the order.

Signing Up with 1&1 eShops
When you want to sign up for an account, click the eShops button along
the Navigation bar of 1&1’s home page. You’re taken to their compari-
son of features screen (refer to Figure 6-2). For the purpose of this chap-
ter, I sign up for a 1&1 Business eShop.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Click the appropriate blue Sign Up button in 
the column of the specific package you want
(remember, for this example, I use a Business
eShop package). You’re taken to the first part of
the Order process, appropriately dubbed Start.
Because of their arrangement with various soft-
ware companies, 1&1 can offer a premium soft-
ware suite to their eShop owners for free, and
the customer pays only for the shipping and
handling cost. Read through the details of the
Special Gift screen to see if this package inter-
ests you, but be aware that you have to sign a
one year contract with 1&1 to get this package.
Additionally, you can sign up for Norton Internet
Security online for a reduced rate after a compli-
mentary trial period.

126
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
3.
On the Your Cart screen, review the billing
information for ordering your new eShop
account. 1&1 has a six-month billing cycle for
their Business eShop customers — you have 
to pay for six months service at a time. The
Professional and Developer eShop customers
pay for three months service at a time. Also
review all the domain names you’ve signed up
for and pay that appropriate amount as well.
When you’re satisfied that the bill is correct
and you don’t want to add any more domain
names to your account, click the Continue
button to go to the next step.
2.
After you decide about your special gifts, click Continue to go to the next step, Choose
a Domain. Here, you’re asked to pick your specific domain name, as shown in the
figure on the left. This is the specific domain name that your customers use to access
your Web store. If you already reserved your domain name, as I discuss in Chapter 3,
you can click the Domain Names link to follow the instructions on transferring your
domain name information so that it points to your 1&1 eShop. If the domain name you
enter isn’t available, 1&1 prompts you with similar domain names that are available.
After you find a domain name that you like or you finish setting up the transfer, click
the Continue button, as shown in the figure on the right, to move onto the next step.
When reviewing the billing information for your new eShop account, 1&1 offers a 90-day money back guaran-
tee. If you cancel your account during the first 90 days, they provide a full refund even if you paid for one full
billing cycle.

4.
In the second part of their process (dubbed
Personalize), 1&1 needs to collect your data,
starting with the country where you reside. On
the Your Country screen, pick the appropriate
radio button for your country of residence or, 
if your country isn’t on the list, pick the Other
Country option and choose from the drop-down
list provided. When you’re done, click the
Continue button to go to the next step.
127
Chapter 6: 1&1 eShops
5.
On the Enter Address screen, 1&1 needs to 
collect your user data. Fill in all the fields as
prompted. If you’re already a 1&1 customer,
select the Yes radio button for the first question
so they can access your account and get the
information. If you’re not already a 1&1 cus-
tomer, complete all the fields marked with an
asterisk (*) and, optionally, complete any extra
fields that apply to your business. After you do
that, you need to decide if you want the address
you just entered to be part of the registration
for your domain name. If you’re paying for pri-
vate registration, you don’t need to worry about
this step. Otherwise, 1&1 uses the address you
provided when they register your domain on
your behalf unless you provide new contact
data that will be used to register your domain.
After you’ve decided what contact data you
want on your domain registration (if any), scroll
down and click Continue to go to the next step.
6.
In the Enter Password screen, create your 
password for your 1&1 eShop account. Your
Customer ID is generated automatically by 1&1
when you complete your order, so please leave
that field alone. You’re asked to enter your pass-
word twice in the boxes provided. Your pass-
word must be at least 7 characters long but no
longer than 18 characters. You want to create a
password that you can remember but not some-
thing that other people can guess. Avoid names
of people, pets, or nicknames that you or others
use, and try to use a combination of letters and
numbers.

128
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
8.
In the last step of the Personalize part, 1&1
needs your payment information. On the
Payment Method screen, enter either your
credit card or PayPal information in the boxes
provided. If using a debit/credit card, fill in the
information in the Credit or Debit Card Details
section. After you do that, in the Credit Card
Billing Address section, use the drop-down list
to select Other Address if your credit card
billing address is different from the address you
provided on the Enter Address screen. If the
address you provided is valid for your credit
card, leave the information as-is and click the
Continue button to process the payment.
7.
On the next screen, Referral, 1&1 wants to know
how you were referred to their organization.
They provide you with a drop-down list of
options where you could have heard of 1&1,
based on their advertising and media coverage.
Pick the appropriate option (this is a manda-
tory step, so you need to pick something) and
click Continue to go to the next step.
10. You’re taken to the Thank You confirmation
screen to confirm your new order. 1&1 sends
you a confirmation e-mail with information on
your new Customer ID and the password you
created.
9.
After your payment is processed, you’re redi-
rected to the Check Out screen to review and
finalize your eShop account creation. The Check
Out screen is the only step in the final part of
the order process, which is appropriately
dubbed Finalize. Look over the account infor-
mation that you filled in as well as the address
and payment information provided. Scroll down
and review the general terms and conditions for
creating your 1&1 account. Select the check box
to say that you agree with the terms and condi-
tions. After you’re ready to process your order,
click the Order Now button.

12. On the E-mail Overview screen, you can create
multiple accounts and/or aliases, which can
point to any e-mail address. Click the Create
button at the bottom of the page to get started.
11. Go to https://admin.1and1.com to log in to
the 1&1 Control Panel to start configuring your
store. You can either wait for the confirmation
e-mail to use your Customer ID to log in, or you
can enter your chosen domain name and the
password you created to log in to the Control
Panel. When you do that, you’re taken to the
Control Panel. Before you start configuring your
store, however, you need to create at least one
valid e-mail address to associate with your store.
Click the E-mail link from the Control Panel to
establish your e-mail account.

13. Use the E-mail Address screen to set up your
main e-mail account for your Web store by com-
pleting the required fields. This is where you
establish where all the incoming mail for your
Web store goes, whether it’s a regular e-mail
mailbox or an existing e-mail mailbox where all
your mail is forwarded. Create a name for your
e-mail address in the box provided and then
specify below that field whether you want a
mailbox for that name or whether you want to
forward all your e-mail to another account away
from your 1&1 Web store account. After you’re
done setting this up, click OK to continue.
You need to allow up to 24 hours before trying to configure your eShop account, as 1&1 first needs to create a
name server entry for your Web store to be functional.

15. Click the Administration tab to go back and view your eShop Control
Panel. Congratulations! You have now gone through the entire sign-up
process to set up your account with 1&1 Solutions.

the Go to Overview button to see your requested
e-mail address. On the E-mail Overview screen,

1.
Log in to your 1&1 Control Panel and click 
the eShop button to go to the 1&1 eShop
Administration screen. When you first go into
your eShop administration, you may see an
intermediate screen that says your eShop is
ready and to click a button to launch the
eShop. If you click the button to launch the
eShop, you’ll end up at the Administration
screen. The Administration screen is organ-
ized into several tabs along the top of it and
specific navigation for each tab, which is
found along the left side of the screen.
2.
Click the Basic Settings link on the left side of
the screen to start the Basic Settings Wizard
and define the general information for your Web
store. In the Basic Settings window, complete
the required fields to define the information you
want listed with your online store. When you’re
done, click the Next button to continue.

4.
Next, you’re asked to define how you want your
customer and invoice numbers to be automati-
cally generated. Using a 1&1 eShop, the soft-
ware automatically creates unique customer
identification numbers as well as invoice num-
bers, based on a scheme you create in this step.
You’re asked to create a prefix, a beginning
number, and a suffix that combines into unique
customer and invoice numbers. You can simply
accept the defaults that are given or create your
own system. When you’re done, click the Next
button to continue.
3.
Next, enter the contact information for cus-
tomers to reach you through your Web store.
1&1 publishes the contact information you 
provide in this step in the form of an e-mail
address, phone number, and/or fax number that
you input into the various boxes. You need to
complete at least one of these fields and you
can choose to complete as many as you want.
Click the Next button when you’re done.
5.
Next, you’re asked whether you want your 
store products automatically sent into Google’s
system for comparing products online, 
codenamed Froogle or Google Base. You’re
prompted with information about Google’s serv-
ice for people who are searching for products
online. This step is designed to get your permis-
sion to have your store products automatically
fed into this engine or not. This service is get-
ting a lot of exposure from Google and can be an
excellent way to gain new customers. Please
note, however, that your store will be grouped
with other stores carrying the same product,
and customers can sort by elements, like lowest
price. You can follow the links on this screen to
read more about the service. After you decide
whether to participate, pick the appropriate
option and click Next to continue.

7.
Now you’re ready to pick a store design. 
Click the Shop Design tab along the top of the
Administration screen to get started. You’re
taken to the Shop Design window. From here,
you can select and then adapt a shop design as
well as create templates that will apply to the
rest of your store.

You’ve now completed the Basic Settings
Wizard. Click the Finish button to store your
answers. You should see a completion screen —
be sure to write down 1&1’s address if you want
to write them about any follow-up issues.

Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to add additional products to your store. If you 
plan on adding a lot of items at one time to your store and you have a
Professional or Developer eShop package, you can click the Import Items
link and send 1&1 a file of all the products you want to upload into your
store. This is done by creating a Comma Separated Values (CSV) text file,
which can be created by saving as a CSV file from a spreadsheet program,
like Microsoft Excel.
3.
When all the fields are completed, scroll down
and click the Finish button to save your item to

that are used for a specific item or you want to
hide the item so it isn’t immediately displayed
in your store, click the Next button instead of
the Save button to edit these advanced settings.
Otherwise, by clicking Finish, you go back to the
Item Administration window where your newly
created product is now sitting on the list. After
you add additional items, you can use the up
and down arrows next to the item description to
raise or lower (respectively) an item’s position
on your store screen.
When viewing your store items in the Item Administration window, the double arrow up or the double arrow
down means that you’ll move the specified item to either the very top or very bottom (respectively) of your

Click the Order Process link on the left side of
the screen to open the Order Process Wizard.
The first part of this process asks you what
fields of information you want the customer to
provide when he’s ordering, for his invoice
address. First, check the boxes of the fields you
want shown on the screen. Then, check the
boxes for the fields you want the customer to
be required to enter. When you’re done with
this, decide if you want your customers to be
able to give a separate shipping address from
their billing address. After you decide that, click
the Next button to go to the next step. If you
decide that a separate shipping address is okay,
in the next screen, pick the fields of information
and required fields for the shipping address, not
the invoice address. Click the Next button to go
to the next step when you’re done.
2.
Click the Tax Settings link on the left side of the
screen to open the Tax Settings Wizard. Here,
choose a service that helps you apply sales 
tax to any applicable customer orders. For
Professional and Developer eShops, you 
can pick the Tax Clearing server to figure 
out the appropriate taxes for customer orders.
Otherwise, you can pick the manual state-/
province-based tax service. Pick your state or
province from a list provided by 1&1 and then
enter the tax rate for each state or province
where you physically do business in the last
screen. If your shipping and handling costs are
more than the actual postage costs, the govern-
ment states that you should tax the shipping
fees as well. Note, however, that this does not
apply if you live in California, Minnesota, or
Ohio. If you do business in more than one state
or province, repeat this step for each location
where your business has a physical presence.
When you’re done, click the Finish button to
save your work.

5.
Next, 1&1 asks you to format the e-mail your cus-
tomers will receive when they place an order
with you. You see a screen asking you whether
to send an automatic order confirmation e-mail
to your customers after they place an order in
your Web store. If you select Yes, you can format
the title, the first, and the last part of the e-mail,
with a copy of their order automatically inserted
into the middle of the e-mail. When you’ve fin-
ished setting up this message the way you want,
click the Next button to go to the next step.

(Optional) Next, 1&1 asks if you want to display
any Terms and Conditions to your customers
when they order. You’ll see a screen where you
can link to a special Web page outlining your
Terms and Conditions, if you want to enforce
that your customers have to read those Terms
and Conditions before their order gets placed
with you. This is optional, but if you select this
option, 1&1 will make sure your customers at
least see this external page and click OK before
their order gets through to you. Click the Next

want the system to e-mail you, the merchant,
when an order comes through. If you select Yes,
you need to format the title, the first, and the

First, click the Edit button next to the Postal
Service line on the Shipping Wizard screen.
You’re taken to the Edit a Shipping Method
screen. You need to have a clear title for your
service and a minimum shipping amount you’ll
charge for orders using this shipping method;
you can also set appropriate thresholds and cor-
responding shipping amounts. For example, you
can establish that orders up to $50 have a $5
shipping fee, orders between $50 and $100 have
a $10 shipping fee, and so on. In order to add a
threshold, click the Add button next to Choose
New Threshold Order Value. You’re taken to
another screen to enter your upper order
amount and corresponding shipping fee for that
order amount. After you pick your threshold
amount, click Finish to save your work, and go
back to the Edit a Shipping Method screen. Click
the Add button again to add more thresholds
until every order amount is covered. When all
your thresholds are created, click the Next
button to finish editing this method.

Click the Shipping link on the left side of the
screen to open the Shipping Wizard. Here, you
define the shipping methods you wish to offer
your customers. You have anywhere from two
options (for a Business eShop) to unlimited
options (for a Developer eShop). I use three
shipping options for the Business eShop — 
the default one, the U.S. Postal Service, and 
one other service.
Can’t come up with a good shipping amount? Figure out what an average order weighs at given amounts, like
$50, $100, and so on and then use the U.S. Postal Service rate calculators at www.usps.com to come up with a
figure that covers shipping that average weight order to a U.S. ZIP code thousands of miles away from your 
business.

11. Click the Payments link on the left side of the
screen to open the Payment Methods Wizard.
This is where you set up your online and offline
payment methods so customers can pay you 
for their orders. For a Business eShop, you 
only have offline payment methods whereas
Professional and Developer eShops can inte-
grate PayPal and WorldPay to accept credit
cards online. After you pick a method to update,
click the Next button to proceed.

At this point, you’re asked whether a customer
number is required to use this shipping method.

O
ne of the most important aspects of running your own 
Web store is being able to collect payments from your cus-
tomers. In the physical world, that amounts to having a functional
cash register with an attached credit card processing terminal.
Imagine trying to run your store if you couldn’t take payments auto-
matically! How would your customers take their purchases home if
you couldn’t collect a payment when they’re ready to check out and
go home? In the online world, this is even more important, as it is
much less likely that they’ll go back to your Web store and pay later
than it is for them to drive back to a physical store.
When it comes to shopping on the Web, the essential currency to
accept is credit cards. Although there are other options to pay
without a credit card (some of which I explore in this chapter), the
main option that almost everyone wants to use is a credit card, pri-
marily Visa and MasterCard. Therefore, I spend this chapter talking
about how your Web store can process credit card payments.
There are two main avenues for accepting credit cards for your
Web store. The more traditional route is the Merchant credit card
account, which is available through your bank and many other
outlets. The other rapidly growing option for Web merchants is
PayPal. I cover both methods as well as other payment collection
options, like Bill Me Later.
I start this chapter by looking at the features and fees of a Merchant account and
PayPal as well as how to evaluate them in relation to your store. I then discuss the
steps you need to take to apply for a Merchant account or a PayPal Business account.
Finally, I look at alternative payment methods and how to sign up for them online.
Features, Fees, and Required Information
for a Merchant Account
In essence, a Merchant account is simply a special type of account that allows a busi-
ness to accept credit cards as a form of payment. A business owner has to apply for
a Merchant account and then the issuing bank or Merchant Service Provider checks
the credit status as well as certain business factors to see if the business qualifies to
have a Merchant account.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Although you can choose from a variety of credit and charge cards, the main two
companies that any Web store owner needs to be aware of are Visa and MasterCard.
Although American Express has grown in popularity among business users — some
of their accounts are charge cards — the customer must pay the bill in full every
month. Because of this, American Express has a different arrangement than Visa or
MasterCard with merchants. If you’re interested in offering American Express as a
payment option, I recommend discussing their arrangement with your local bank to
see if they offer American Express as an option and to have that bank go over the
specific arrangement.
Many fees are involved with a Merchant account that a business owner needs to be
aware of, which is due to the relationship between the bank and credit card issuing
company and how the credit card payments are processed. Some of the charges are
monthly in nature, independent of how many payments are received. Most charges,
however, are based on the individual charges your customers make with you, and
those fees are based on a percentage or rate of each charge amount you receive
from your customers. Therefore, here’s a quick summary of the different charges
you can expect to pay:

Interchange Rate: This is also known as the Interchange Fee, or the credit
card rate. In essence, this is the percentage you pay every time you accept a
credit card from a customer. When you see a Merchant Service Provider
advertise a special rate for their credit card processing, like 1.87 percent or
2.3 percent, typically they’re referring to the lowest or average Interchange
Rate that they charge.
The Interchange Rate depends on the type of credit card used in the trans-
action and how that credit card was processed by the merchant. Because
hundreds of different combinations apply here, banks normally group their
rates into a few categories and quote rates for only those categories.
Typically, a lower rate applies when there’s less work (or less fraud poten-
tial) on the bank’s part. Any credit card swiped into a terminal is easier than
keying in the number manually, so swiped credit card transactions typically
have a lower Interchange Rate than cards processed manually. However,
keying in a credit card number to a credit card terminal is seen as easier, or
less risky, than keying in a credit card over the Internet, so the former has a
lower Interchange Rate than the latter.

Qualified Rate: This is also known as the Discount Rate. Depending on a
merchant’s typical way of interacting with their customers and getting the
credit card information, the bank establishes a Qualified Rate for transac-
tions that are considered standard for the merchant. For example, retail cus-
tomers usually have a Qualified Rate for credit cards swiped into a special
credit card terminal whereas Internet-based customers have their Qualified
Rate based on accepting credit cards electronically through a Payment
Gateway over the Internet.
When you set up your Merchant account, make sure your Qualified Rate is
based on the actual way you plan to take credit cards. If you’re only going 
to do business over the Internet, your Qualified Rate should be based on an
Internet merchant, not a retail merchant.

Non-Qualified Rate: This rate applies to the merchant when a credit card 
is processed differently from a merchant’s normal mode of business. This
rate is always higher than a Qualified Rate, and occurs when, for example, 
a retail merchant keys in the credit card number into a terminal instead of

147
Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options
swiping the card or an Internet merchant settles the batch order after an
unusual amount of time. Therefore, to avoid getting hit with this rate, make
sure you process as many of your orders as possible within the set guide-
lines of your issuing bank or Merchant Service Provider.

Authorization Fee: This is a small fee that is assessed each time you send a
credit card number to be processed to the issuing bank. Typically, this fee is
an average of 10–30 cents and is charged regardless of whether the transac-
tion is successful.

Statement Fee: This is a monthly fee assessed by your issuing bank or
Merchant Service Provider, and it’s supposed to cover the cost of your
account provider, providing a detailed monthly statement of the credit card
charges you collected and the different fees you have to pay. Although some
issuers don’t have a Statement Fee, most do charge anywhere from $5–$30
per month.

Batch Fee: Every time you, as the merchant, send a batch of credit card
orders to be processed by the bank, you may be charged a specific Batch
Fee. Some accounts come with a standard amount of batch requests
included, and this fee would be charged only when you exceed your 
standard allotment of batch requests.

Chargeback Fee: When one of your customers tries to dispute a charge, 
the issuing bank may issue a chargeback in an attempt to retrieve the cus-
tomer’s funds. When that occurs, you may experience a Chargeback Fee to
cover the bank’s efforts of resolving this conflict. Unfortunately, you pay
this fee regardless of whether the chargeback is successful.

Minimum Monthly Fee: This isn’t necessarily its own fee, but many Merchant
account issuers require that you have a minimum amount of fees charged
against your account every month. Therefore, they put a Minimum Monthly
Fee into place, so if you have a month where you charge very little, the issu-
ing bank or provider can assess a minimum volume of fees regardless of activ-
ity. This minimum can be anywhere from $10 or $15 to $30, $50, or higher.

Setup Fee: This is a one-time fee charged by many Merchant Service
Providers to create your Merchant account, and the amount varies by
provider. Be aware that some providers make more of their income through
a higher Setup Fee, which allows them to charge a smaller Interchange Rate.
I’ve seen Setup Fees range from $25 or $50, all the way to $250 or $500.
Shop around for a competitive package, especially when the Setup Fee is
involved. Many Merchant account providers have special promotions where
they waive the Setup Fee during a specific time period or to price-match a
competitive provider.
So, you’re ready to apply and open your own Merchant account. Before you run to
your local bank and ask for an application, make sure that you have the following
information, documents, and estimates before you get started:

Startup documentation: Most of the time, you’re doing business under a
name that has nothing to do with your last name. Therefore, the bank wants
to see that you have the appropriate documentation, licenses, and permits
that allow you to do business under your assumed business name. Therefore,
you should have copies of some (or all) of these different documents to help
establish your business identity:

148
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
• Reseller’s Permit (or Sales Tax Permit): Issued by your state govern-
ment, typically the Board of Equalization or a division of the Secretary 
of State.
• Fictitious Business Statement (also known as Doing Business As [DBA]):
issued by your county government.
• Proof of Publication of Fictitious Business Statement: Typically, you’re
required to publish your Doing Business As statement in a local newspa-
per for several weeks, and the bank wants to see proof that your ad was
published. The newspaper that runs your ad prepares a standardized
receipt for you.
• Business License (or Tax License): issued by your city government or
town hall where your business is occurring (such as your home, your
physical office space, or your warehouse location).
• Incorporation, LLC (Limited Liability Corporation), or Partnership
agreement: If you’re setting up a special type of business that isn’t a Sole
Proprietorship, you’ll have a document on file stating the ownership
nature of your business that, usually, is prepared by an attorney and filed
with the state and federal governments.

Business statistics: In order to estimate what type of Merchant account to
give your business and what Interchange Rates you qualify for as a mer-
chant, the bank or provider wants to know certain statistics (or estimates, if
you’re a brand-new merchant) regarding your business and expected credit
card volume. Specifically, some of that information is
• Type of goods sold: This isn’t necessarily a moral or ethical question for
the bank (although there are some cases, like online gambling, that banks
can’t support in the U.S. anymore), but rather a question of how stable
and sustainable your business is, whether you may experience a high
level of returns and/or chargebacks, and if the goods are customized to
the point that they can’t be returned.
• Average order amount: If you’re a new merchant, obviously you have to
estimate this amount, but if you’ve done business before, simply calcu-
late the average order size you’ve experienced so far. Providers want to
know how big each average transaction will be, and your rate will typi-
cally be lower as your average order amount goes up.
• Average monthly amount: This is the average amount you’ll be receiving in
credit card charges per month. Typically, the banks have a rate for differ-
ent ranges (say, fewer than $5,000 per month, $5,000–$10,000 per month,
and so on) and calculate your average every three or six months to see 
if you continue to qualify for your designated rate. If you’re a new 
merchant, estimate as best as possible and use any research, business
plans, or financial information to help solidify your estimate. Similar to the
average order amount, the more you charge every month, the lower your
Interchange Rate should be. However, if you state a high average monthly
amount and fall dramatically short, the penalties and fees involved could
more than erase any cost savings from claiming a high monthly amount.
• Length of time in business: Once again, questions like these are asked 
to gauge the reliability and trustworthiness of your business. Because
many of the fraud issues facing Visa and MasterCard are occurring with
Internet-based transactions (like with a Web store), they’re giving extra
scrutiny to new applications for Internet-based Merchant accounts.

149
Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options
Therefore, the longer you’ve been in business, the better chance your
application has of being approved. Even if you’re just starting your
Internet phase of doing business, be sure to put the length of time for
your business in any form — Internet, retail, or otherwise.

Type of credit card transaction: There are different ways for merchants to
process a customer’s credit card, and based on the merchant’s interaction
with the customer, the banks can set different Interchange Rates for your
account. Therefore, the way you process cards influences your account.
Here are the most common options:
• Payment Gateway: Virtually every e-commerce store has to process 
their credit card orders through a Payment Gateway, which allows the
merchant to send their credit card orders through a special, security-
enhanced page over the Internet to be processed by the issuing bank or
Merchant Service Provider. Typically, the bank contracts with a third-
party Payment Gateway to handle the transmission of data although
some organizations now have their own gateway.
• Credit Card Terminal: If you plan on having any physical interaction with
your customers, you may consider getting a Credit Card Terminal with
your account. This allows you to swipe a physical credit card and qualify
for lower rates than using a Payment Gateway because these terminals
are less risky and require less effort on the bank’s behalf. This is benefi-
cial only if you have a retail operation alongside your Web store or plan
on setting up at any conventions, trade shows, markets, or any other
venue where your customers come directly to you.
• Automated Response Unit: These are special phone numbers that mer-
chants call to process credit cards over the phone and receive an auto-
mated response code that they would handwrite on a credit card receipt
for their client. If you plan on doing sales at remote locations where ter-
minals have bad or no reception (like swap meets or trade fairs), this
could be a viable option for your business, but only for those sales you
generate at these venues. Your Internet sales should still be handled
through a Payment Gateway.
Features and Fees of a PayPal Account
In the late 1990s, interest in eBay exploded as people started using the auction site
to buy and sell goods from each other around the globe. One of the hardest parts of
that process became the payment phase — buyers had to mail checks or money
orders to their sellers, the seller would wait for the payment to clear, and the seller
couldn’t mail the item until the payment had cleared. Therefore, new companies
arose to handle electronic payments for goods using the Internet and credit cards.
One of those companies was PayPal, which quickly rose as a favorite service among
eBay users. The site grew in such popularity that eBay abandoned their own internal
payment service, known as BillPoint, and acquired PayPal in 2002.
Today, PayPal is focused on reaching every Internet merchant, not just eBay users,
which means they offer a very competitive and easy-to-use package for Web store
owners. They offer several levels of Merchant Solutions to accommodate the small-
est or largest Web store owner, all without any setup or statement fee and without
any minimum monthly fee. You can see an overview of PayPal’s merchant services
on their Web site, www.paypal.com, as shown in Figure 7-1.

150
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Figure 7-1: PayPal offers different Merchant Solutions!
Currently, three types of PayPal accounts apply to Internet merchants and their abil-
ity to take credit cards from their customers:

Website Payments Standard: This package allows you to place a button on
your Web site that interfaces with PayPal. After your customer places his
order, he’s taken to PayPal’s server to handle the authentication and pay-
ment information part of his order. After his credit card has been processed,
PayPal returns the user to your Web site to show complete confirmation on
your order. Then, the funds from that order are deposited into your PayPal
account.

Website Payments Pro: This package allows your PayPal account to
directly interface with one of hundreds of shopping cart providers and 
e-commerce systems. After your customer places her order, she inputs 
her credit card or PayPal information on your Web site. The information is
transmitted electronically to PayPal for authorization, and your customer
never leaves your Web site, seeing confirmation of her order as soon as
PayPal returns the successful authorization message to your Web site. The
funds from her order are deposited automatically into your PayPal account.
Currently, the Website Payments Pro package is available only to PayPal
business customers from the United States.

151
Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options

E-mail Payments: This package allows you to use PayPal as an invoicing
tool, where you can create invoices from PayPal, QuickBooks, or Microsoft
Outlook. You send your customer a specific invoice for a bill that’s due and
then that customer follows the instructions on the invoice she receives and
enters her payment information into PayPal. PayPal then processes that
invoice and deposits the funds into your PayPal account.
You can review the different features of these three plans by going to www.paypal.
com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-comparison, as in Figure 7-2.
When it comes to fees for these packages, basically worry about one fee — the cost
per transaction for accepting credit card orders. Currently, the basic rate for PayPal
transactions is 2.9% plus $0.30 per order. If you plan on receiving more than $10,000
per month in transactions, you can apply to PayPal for a lower rate, which goes as
low as 1.9% plus $0.30 per transaction. If you’re receiving money from someone out-
side the U.S., there’s an additional currency conversion fee that is 1 percent of the
order amount.
Furthermore, if you use Website Payments Pro or the Virtual Terminal product with
Website Payments Standard, an additional $20 per month flat fee is added regardless
of transaction level. There’s no Setup Fee, no Minimum Monthly Fee, no Statement
Fee, and no Batch Fee for any of these packages.
Figure 7-2: Compare various packages from PayPal.

152
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
When it comes to deciding whether to get a PayPal account for your Web store, it
helps to weigh the pros and cons of this account. Here’s a brief list of a few of the pros:

Very low startup cost: No Startup or Statement Fees, and you pay only
when you receive money. This solution has become ideal for many small
merchants, where the various Merchant account fees translate into a sizable
percentage of sales.

Easy application process: In many cases, you’re approved automatically for
most of their packages without paying money to find out you don’t qualify.

Shopping cart technology built-in: You can use PayPal’s pre-programmed
buttons to build your own shopping cart or use their API (Application
Programming Interface) technology to interface with one of hundreds of 
different shopping cart technologies so you don’t need an extra payment
gateway to handle your credit cards.

Your buyers don’t need PayPal accounts: Nowadays, your customers don’t
need to join PayPal to use these services. They can simply enter their credit
card numbers, and the money is deposited into your account.

You don’t have to store or see credit card numbers: With PayPal, the cus-
tomer enters his number, and all you see as the merchant is the deposit of
money. You don’t have to worry about storing, encrypting, or protecting the
customer’s credit card information, as you never see it or need it to get paid.
Here’s a brief list of a few of the cons:

Extra step to receive money: Your PayPal account doesn’t automatically
withdraw the funds or scrape funds automatically into a checking or savings
account. You have to log in to PayPal and manually transfer the funds into
your bank account. Typically, the transfer can take as long as three to four
business days.

Less chargeback protection: With a Merchant account, the issuing bank
defends you against a chargeback by getting the documentation for a dis-
pute first and not withdrawing the funds until a judgment has been found
against you. With PayPal, the money is frozen upon a dispute being filed,
and there are limited tools for a seller to provide proof and defend her case
against a customer chargeback.

Possible higher cost: If you’ll process a high volume of credit card orders,
you may save money with a competitive discount rate from a Merchant
account because the other fees barely factor into a percentage calculation if
you’re processing a lot of volume each month.
Applying for Your Merchant Account
There is no definitive way to apply for a Merchant account nowadays, as any new
Web store owner will find out. Many companies are fighting for your business in 
this area, so you have plenty of options for applying for and receiving a Merchant
account. Here are some of the most common ways to get a Merchant account:

153
Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options

Contact your local business bank: If you have a bank account established
for your Web store already, you should ask that bank if you can create a
Merchant account as well. If you’re still setting up your Web store, you 
may want to create your own business checking account to separate your
finances. When doing that, ask the bank you’re considering if they offer
Merchant accounts or Merchant Credit Card accounts. This way, you have
one operation to handle all your banking needs, instead of dealing with 
multiple organizations.

Pick a low-cost provider of Merchant accounts: When you sign up for your
Fictitious Business Statement, you’ll be amazed at the volume of offers that
start showing up in your mailbox. Many of these companies buy lists of the
names of newly formed businesses and send out offers of setting up your
own Merchant account. As I state earlier, read the fine print when it comes
to each offer, as some companies waive Startup Fees for higher Interchange
Rates down the road, for example.

Use a membership or group association to get your account: Based on
your membership with various organizations, you may have a great link to a
company that will handle your Merchant account. Some examples of groups
that offer their members credit card processing accounts include Costco,
the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), and more. Check
with your local trade organization, chamber of commerce, and even your
school alumni organization.

Pursue an alternative, such as PayPal: In the next section, I discuss 
opening an account with PayPal, which is an alternative to the Merchant
account. In any case, have as much information and paperwork as possible
when you apply and allow some time for your application to be processed
before you can begin accepting payments. Typically, you should get an
answer within one to two weeks, at most, and you can get more specific
timelines from your issuing bank or provider.

154
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Signing Up for a PayPal Account
When you’re ready to sign up for a PayPal account, be sure to have a
credit card and a bank account in the U.S. as well as your tax identifica-
tion number and business information ready to go for your application.
For this example, I sign up for a PayPal Business account.
1.
Go to the PayPal home page at www.paypal.
com and click the blue Sign Up link at the top of
the screen. You can always click the Business
tab (along the top half of the page) to read more
about the different options, which I discuss in
the section “Features and Fees of a PayPal
Account,” earlier in this chapter or read some of
the Questions or Learn More articles and guides
available on the home page.

PayPal has three levels of accounts: the
Personal account, designed to trade money
among you and your friends; the Premier
account, designed for individual eBay sellers to
accept credit card payments from eBay buyers;
and the Business account, designed for busi-
nesses to accept credit cards on and off eBay.
After clicking the Sign Up link, pick the PayPal
Business account as your account type and 
then click the Start Now button. The Merchant
Services packages are designed exclusively for
Business account holders. Therefore, I recom-
mend you establish a Business account.

your payment solution. Click the Go button to
start entering your information. At this point,
PayPal walks you through their 3-step process
for opening an account. First, they ask you to fill
out an application with all the pertinent busi-
ness information. Alongside that, you need to
provide a valid U.S. bank account for your busi-
ness. PayPal verifies your information, and after
you’re confirmed and verified, you’re given
tools, links, and other necessary information to
start setting up your payment account.

Pick your specific Payment Solution and click
the Continue button. At this step in the process,
you can pick from a drop-down list of PayPal’s
different Merchant Solutions offerings, including
Website Payments Standard, Website Payments
Pro, and E-mail Payments. Based on our dis-
cussion in the section “Features and Fees of a

Set up your password recovery questions and
review the Terms and Conditions. When you
scroll down the page, you see the Password
Recovery questions. When you pick a question
and set up an answer, you can recover your
password in the future if you forget or lose your
password. Secondly, you can review the PayPal
Terms and Conditions and check the boxes
when you agree to those terms so you can
create your account. You’re asked to enter some
letters into a designated Security Measure box
as a security measure to ensure that a person,
and not a computer, is creating this account.
After you do that, click the Continue button.
6.
Fill out your Business Owner Contact
Information and create an account. In the first
part of the page, input the information for the
business owner of this account. You can use the
same address as your business or a separate
mailing address if you wish, but make sure the
owner’s contact information matches the billing
information for the bank account. After you
complete this section, scroll down to create
your PayPal account. Instead of a user ID, your
PayPal account is based on the e-mail address
you use to define your account. Enter the e-mail
address where you want all PayPal-related infor-
mation to go and then enter a password for
your account. I recommend that you create a
separate e-mail account and/or e-mail alias for
your PayPal account so it isn’t tied to one spe-
cific employee or user who may leave your busi-
ness down the road.
8.
Enter your bank account information (and
optionally, your business credit card informa-
tion). In this step, you’re asked to enter your
bank account information. You can use one of
your blank checks as a guide to get the impor-
tant information needed, primarily your 9-digit
ABA(American Banking Association) number (or
a routing number), which identifies your particu-
lar bank and your 10-digit checking account
number. Both numbers can be found along the
bottom of a blank check. After you enter your
bank account information, you can add addi-
tional security to your account by defining a
credit card tied to your business. This is
optional, and if you check the box, you’re asked
on the next screen to input your credit card
information. When you’re ready, click the
Continue button to complete the process.

10. Now you need to confirm your e-mail address.
When you created your account, PayPal sends
an e-mail to your designated e-mail address with
a Confirmation link that you can click to confirm
the address. Check your e-mail account and look
for an e-mail from PayPal. Click the highlighted

11. When you click the link, you’re taken back 
to PayPal and asked to put in your password.
After you do that, you’ve confirmed your e-mail
address and should see a confirmation screen.
Click the Continue button to go back to the
PayPal main screen.
Many fraudulent people are sending fake e-mails pretending to be from PayPal, eBay, or your local bank, asking
you to click a link that secretly takes you to their Web site, not the real site, in hopes of getting valuable account
information.When you click the link from the e-mail, make sure the address starts with xxx.paypal.com, where
xxx is the name of one of PayPal’s servers.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
12. After you confirm your e-mail address, you have to confirm your bank
account. At this point, PayPal deposits two small amounts into your 
bank account in the next 24 to 48 hours. You need to access your bank
account and find out what those deposits are. After you know the
amounts, you can log in to PayPal again and enter that information to
verify your account. This means that you can transfer funds between 
your PayPal account and your bank account.
This information takes several days to show up on your banking statements, so you need to allow up to three to
five business days to finalize this step.

Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options
Adding PayPal to Your Web Store
After you create your account, you can start to implement your account
while you’re waiting on verification from your bank account (and/or
credit card). Depending on the package you select and the storefront
provider that’s powering your Web store, you’ll be implementing PayPal
in different ways.
In this section, I cover the most common uses that people do when
adding PayPal capability to their Web store. For this exercise, I use a
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Web store. Although these steps are meant
for Yahoo!, they should work on the other storefront providers (such as
ProStores and 1&1 eShops).

Log in to your PayPal account. At this point,
you’re logging in to your PayPal account so you
can grant access for your storefront provider
(Yahoo! in this example) to access your PayPal
account.

You now begin the PayPal Express Checkout
sign up process. Click the orange Sign Up for
PayPal Express Checkout button to proceed. 
At this point, you’re prompted with a summary
of what you need to complete this process. Be
sure to have the necessary information avail-
able before you click the Sign Up for PayPal
Express Checkout button to be taken to PayPal.

Select the Sign Up for PayPal Express Checkout
option and then click the orange Next button.
At this point, you could select the Sign Up for a
Merchant Account option and walk through the
process of applying for an account through
Chase Paymentech, you could sign up using an
existing Merchant account, or you could assign
your PayPal account to your Web store, which
is what I select.

6.
Grant permission for Yahoo! to access your
PayPal account by clicking the I Agree button.
This step is for you to give specific permission for
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions to access your PayPal
account using special computer language — API,
or Application Programming Interface. By clicking
the I Agree button, your Yahoo! store can access
your PayPal account so that funds from new
orders can be deposited into that account.

Chapter 7: Establishing Your Payment Options
Of course, PayPal is integrated with lots of other shopping carts besides Yahoo! Merchant Solutions.
You can peruse the PayPal Solutions Directory to find instructions on integrating your own shopping 
cart at www.paypal.com/en_US/html/SolutionsDirectory/sd_ec-compatible.html.

You’ve now linked the two accounts (PayPal 
and Yahoo! Merchant Solutions). On your main
PayPal screen, Express Checkout is defined as
your payment option. You should be taken auto-
matically to your main PayPal screen. Now, you
will see Express Checkout defined as your pay-
ment solution, which means you added your
PayPal account successfully to your Yahoo!
Merchant Solutions account. If, for some reason,
this does not show up automatically, click the
link “Getting Started Steps” from the left hand
navigation bar under the header Set Up Your

Adding PayPal Buttons to Your Web Site
If you don’t have a shopping cart to use and are selling only a few select
items, you can use PayPal’s system to have a virtual shopping cart in
which you can place pre-programmed PayPal buttons on your Web site
that act as a shopping cart for your customers.

Log in to your PayPal account and click 
the Merchant Services tab. Then click the
Website Payments Standard link. On the page
describing the Website Payments Standard
package, you see the various buttons you
can create with PayPal. These are examples
of the buttons you can create with the PayPal
system. Let’s say that you want to sell multi-
ple items; click the Sell Multiple Items link to
start using the PayPal shopping cart.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 

W
hen people think of store design, they typically think
about what kind of shelving units are needed to hold
their products, how wide to make their aisles, what display will be
visible from the front window, and other concerns of the retail
world. When you translate that into online store design, most
people assume that a shopping cart, some buttons, and graphics
are enough to qualify as “design.” Given the growing competition
for reaching online customers, however, store design is quickly
becoming an important and differentiating factor as customers are
looking for quality, uniqueness, and a good value for their money.
Today, the design of your store speaks as loudly as your slogan,
brand image, and value proposition. This does not mean you have
to use the latest and greatest technologies, since most of those rise
and fall in popularity. The core values of a good store design apply
on the Internet just as they do in the brick-and-mortar “offline”
community. Those values include a clean and intuitive design that makes it easy for
customers to shop and gives your store a professional appearance. 
In this chapter, we present the basic steps to consider for your Web store. We start
with good old fashioned pen and paper, as you map out the page and category struc-
ture for your store. From there, you will use your road map to construct the most
important page on your Web store — the home page. One of the essentials of your
home page, which will also exist on every other page within your Web site, is the
navigation bar, so we go through creating a navigation bar and the basics that will
help you decide the contents of that area. Finally, we talk about the items that typi-
cally take up the middle of the home page — the “featured” products or specials for
your Web store, and add them to the home page.
Creating Your Store Design . . . on Paper
Even though you are building an electronic commerce store, and you are using the
Internet and all this computer automation, it does not mean you should abandon a
good old piece of paper and a pencil as your starting point. The best store owners
are those that plan out in advance how they want their stores to look, and then use
those plans when constructing their store, whether it’s a physical retail store or an
e-commerce Web store. Therefore, we are going to discuss some common things to
consider when laying out your Web store design.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
First and foremost, you should decide up front on your purpose — what kind of a
Web store you wish to implement. Yes, we know, you want a Web store that is prof-
itable and makes money, right? What we mean is whether your main goal is just sell-
ing products, or whether you want to provide functions, tools, and other mechanisms
on your Web store that draw people back regardless of whether they want to pur-
chase something.
In Web terms, building functions that keep customers on your site longer or keep
customers returning to your site is called “making your site sticky” because these
functions mean your customers “stick around” longer. Typically, this leads to more
loyal customers, or more revenue opportunities through increased advertising rev-
enue, more frequent sales per customers, and so on.
Once you decide on your purpose, you can begin thinking about your design,
because the number one question you should always consider when mapping out
your store design is “Does this fit my store’s purpose?” If it doesn’t directly (or indi-
rectly) serve your purpose, then it should be considered as an extra step, to be 
done only if you have finished everything else and have extra time and money to
implement it.
As you turn your purpose into a full store design, you can break down your goal into
actual sections of your store by answering these questions:

Are you going to focus solely on selling products? The number of different
categories and product pages will make up the bulk of your Web store, and
the navigation to your main product category home pages should be only
one click away from your home page.

What are your main product categories? There is a fine line between having
too many categories available from the home page and having very general
categories that require extra clicking on the customer’s behalf. Your goal is to
make any product no more than 3 clicks away from the home page, as anything
that requires more than 3 clicks will not capture the interest of your customers
(or the search engines, for that matter) and be a waste of virtual space.

Are customers going to have an account on your system? If so, you need
to create a unique section where customers can log into their account, view
past orders, make changes to their profile, and access special “customer-
only” Web pages, like discussion forums or sales pages. 

What extra functions (if any) do you want to provide on your site? If you
plan on adding extra functionality to your Web store, do you want those
functions available (and visible) to anyone who comes by your Web store? If
so, they should be readily available from the home page and a part of your
navigation bar.

How much communication do you plan to have with your store visitors?
For some companies, a simple page explaining their history, mission, and
contact information is sufficient. Other companies have an entire section
dedicated to press releases, the company blog, feedback forms, and other
ways to connect with their customers.

How much help are you going to provide on your web store? For some
companies, a simple page with Frequently Asked Questions is sufficient.
Other companies have an entire section where you can look up questions
from a database, send in a problem report, and interact on discussion
boards with company employees and even other customers.

167
Chapter 8: Laying Out Your Design from the Ground Up
Once you have defined your list of core functions or categories, it is time to draw out
your Web site “map” on a piece of paper. At the top of your map is the home page
(the starting point, or launch pad, for all your customers), and you create a box for
each Web page that is required, drawing links in between the boxes to indicate the
relationship between pages. Don’t worry about the actual look of each web page yet,
just identify how many different Web pages are required and how they are inter-
linked. When you are done, you should have something that resembles a flowchart,
as shown in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1: You map out your entire Web site first.
Determining Your Category Structure
Once you have mapped out your Web store as a whole, you probably need to be
more specific in the products section of your store, which means you need to devise
a good category structure. Depending on the products you plan to sell, your cate-
gory structure may already be devised for you. In other cases, however, you may
want to create your own unique categories that speak to your customers very specif-
ically. You may want to create a “Bargain” or “Under $10” category, or dedicate a cat-
egory to a specific person or cause. Remember, it all goes back to your purpose and
what best serves that purpose.
To that end, here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your category
structure:

Use terms and headers that your customers are familiar with hearing.

Don’t make one product an entire category.

Individual products should be within three clicks of the home page. This
was mentioned in the section above but bears repeating. Create a mix of
categories and main subcategory headers so that the third click, if neces-
sary, goes from a subcategory directly to a product detail page.

Look at your competition for ideas.

Your categories should be independent of your promotions.

Designing Your Web Store Home Page
After you lay out your store design on paper, your next step is to trans-
late that map into your online store. Therefore, the most important
page to create is your home page, since that will serve as the entry
point for your customers and visitors. For this exercise, we are creating
a home page for a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Web store. Your template
will automatically create the basic elements of your home page, so this
exercise is designed to refine that first draft.

This screen is where you can update the ele-

Message field to make sure that is the introduc-
tory text you want your customers to see on
your home page. Give your home page a title in
the Page-title field (be sure to use keywords that
apply to the products you sell) and if you have a
logo, click the Upload button next to the Image
header to put that logo on your home page.

3.
In order to arrange the position of content on
your home page, click the Change button in the
line marked Page-elements. You’ll see a table of
items labeled Edit List Position. Basically, on
this screen, you assign the order of elements
that will appear on your home page. For exam-
ple, the default home page that was created in
my example puts the Specials (or Featured
items) first, and then my introductory message
second. Pick which elements you want to
appear on your home page, and put a number
(1, 2, 3, and so on) next to each element in the
order you wish them to appear on your home
page. When you are done, click the Update
button. 
Home Page Guidelines
There are definite guidelines to consider
when you are constructing your home page:
 Do not overload your home page. While
your Web store may offer a lot of Web
pages, you don’t want to overwhelm
your customers when they first visit you.
Provide a general roadmap on your
home page for customers to get started,
and give them more specific information
and links as they explore further.
 White space is your friend. Don’t feel like
you have to cover every square inch of
the screen with a graphic or text header.
You will emphasize the information you
have on your Web store by surrounding
it with lots of white space, so customers
eyes will zero in on the important 
sections.
 Use either a two-column or three-
column approach on your page.The two
most prominent designs for a Web site
home page today are the two-column
approach, with a navigation bar along
the left and a main section for promo-
tions and ads in the middle, and a three-
column approach, with a navigation bar,
middle section, and right-hand column
reserved for promotions.
 Put your most important information at
the top. Newspapers use the terminol-
ogy “above the fold” to indicate the top
half of their page that is visible without
turning over the paper. For Web sites,
above the fold means the top part of the
Web page that does not require the user
to scroll down the page. If your customer
has to scroll down to see something
important, there is an excellent chance
they won’t take the time and instead go
to a competitor’s Web site.

Click the Update button when you are done
making changes to your home page. You’ll see
your new home page with the changes you spec-
ified. (In my example, I changed the order of the
Specials and Message, compared with the first
figure.) Click the Publish button on the top tool-
bar to send all of your changes to your live Web
store. 
4.
Scroll down the page to finish updating your
home page. The last four fields on this screen
determine how your Featured products are dis-
played on the home page. Most importantly, the
Contents-elements field decides which aspects
of a product are displayed on the page. The
default is normally Image, Screen-text title, and
Price. I would highly advise you to add the
Order aspect (by holding down the CTRL button
while clicking on Order from the list), it will put
an Add to Cart button next to each item, so
your customers can order a Featured product
directly from the home page. Finally, the
Columns field is designed to arrange your
Featured products in the designated number of
columns. Make sure you stick to two or three so
you avoid having a crowded home page. 

171
Chapter 8: Laying Out Your Design from the Ground Up
Creating Your Navigation Bar
If you equate your home page with the clean company lobby with the
helpful receptionist, then think of your navigation bar as that helpful
building directory that hangs by every elevator. After all, if your cus-
tomers or visitors can’t easily find their away around your store, how can
they be expected to build an order, checkout, and help you make money
with your venture? Therefore, you should spend some time in planning
exactly how you want your navigation bar, or “nav bar” for short, since
this will be an important tool for customers to use throughout their shop-
ping experience with you. Again, for this exercise we are using a Yahoo!
Merchant Solutions Web store to edit or revise the navigation bar that
was automatically created when you started creating your store.

172
Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Navigation Bar Guidelines
Here are some helpful guidelines for you to
use when designing your navigation bar: 
 Pick the 3-6 most important sections of
your website to appear in the navigation
bar. Any less than 3 sections means that
you don’t have a lot of sections for your
site, and more than 7 options turns your
navigation bar into more of a “site map”
where you try and detail everything at
once. 
 Each section on your navigation bar can
have its own “sub-navigation bar” with
more specific categories. If your Web
store has lots of different product cate-
gories, you don’t have to limit your nav-
igation to only the biggest category
headers without additional assistance.
You can “expand” your navigation selec-
tions once someone picks a specific cat-
egory or item on your navigation bar,
and show a whole sub-list of more spe-
cific pages or subcategories that are
available only from the main section
header. 
 Always include a link back to the home
page in your navigation bar. The first
constant to any good navigation bar is
that, somewhere in the navigation, a
user can click a link and be taken back to
the home page. This way, regardless of
which section your customer is brows-
ing, if they get lost, confused, or bored,
they can easily go back to your home
page.
 Your shopping cart should have a fixed
location on your navigation bar or
screen. At any time while a customer is
visiting your Web store, they need to
have access to see what items are cur-
rently in their shopping cart. Therefore, it
is encouraged to create a special place
on the page, preferably in the navigation
bar or along the top of the screen, where
the customer can easily go into their
shopping cart to review their order or go
ahead and purchase their items.
 Certain pages don’t need a fixed loca-
tion on your navigation bar. While it’s
very important to have a clearly defined
privacy policy on your Web site, that
page does not need to be accessible
throughout the entire Web site. Your nav-
igation bar is meant for sections of your
Web site that need to be easily accessi-
ble regardless of where your customers
are in the shopping or ordering process. 
 Make sure your navigation bar is in the
same place on every page of your Web
site.There is very little that is worse than
having to hunt around a Web page every
time to locate the navigation bar. The key
is consistency, as your customers expect
to see the navigation bar as their fixed
constant when they browse and click
around your Web store. 
 Have a text-only version of your naviga-
tion bar appear at the bottom of the
page. Whether you have buttons or text
for your nav bar, including a text-only
copy at the bottom of your page is good
for customers, in case the buttons don’t
load correctly. It is great for search
engines as well, which ignore any graph-
ical navigation bars and go straight for
the text links to find and index the rest of
your Web site.

173
Chapter 8: Laying Out Your Design from the Ground Up
4.
Click on the Change button in the Nav-buttons variable line to update the
order of buttons that appear on your navigation bar. Decide on the order
of elements you wish to include in your navigation bar, put a 1 next to the
1st/top element, a 2 next to the second element, and so on. When you’re
done, click the Update button to save your choices. 
5.
Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the Update button to save all of your choices. This
will take you back to the Store Editor screen, showing your home page with your newly updated navi-
gation bar. Review how your choices have affected your navigation bar and click the Publish button
to update your Web store with your newly updated navigation bar. 
You should almost always select Home as your first element so customers can return to your home page easily,
and you should consider assigning Index (your Site Map), Privacypolicy (your Privacy Policy page), and Info (your
About Us information) as parts of your navigation bar.
3.
Scroll down the page past the Contents-
Navigation fields until you see the last variables
(for Navigation) before the Home Page Contents
section begins. If you want your navigation bar
to be bigger, change the Global-navigation-text-
size field to 12px or 14px to increase the size.
You can update the text in the next five fields to
indicate what will appear on the referenced
button; you don’t have to accept the default
that Yahoo! put in that field. Give those naviga-
tion bar elements an appropriate name based
on the style of Web store you wish to create.

Part II: Constructing Your Web Store 
Adding Your Featured Products or Sale Items
Sometimes, having to pick your favorite product among your catalog of
inventory is like having to pick a favorite child or pet. You want every piece
of inventory to sell well, otherwise you wouldn’t be carrying it, right? Well,
there are some products that are going to sell more often than others,
whether it’s a “fad” item (like Tickle Me Elmo for the holiday shoppers), a
seasonal item (coats and jackets at the beginning of winter), or a new prod-
uct that’s entering the marketplace (the release of a new video game
system, like the Sony Playstation 3 or the Nintendo Wii) that require a spe-
cial placement and more emphasis. Hence, we have the “featured” product,
which typically gets a prime placement on a Web store home page — usu-
ally the very middle of it. For this exercise we are using a Yahoo! Merchant
Solutions Web store to create a Featured Products section by selecting
products you created in your catalog to become Featured or put on sale.

Chapter 8: Laying Out Your Design from the Ground Up
Featured Products Guidelines
Since you are using important space on your
store home page to emphasize a particular
product (or two or three), there needs to be
some consideration as to which product(s) to
use as “featured” and for how long. Let’s take
a look at the questions you need to ask your-
self to help figure out this dilemma:
 What are your customers asking for?
One of the goals of a featured item is to
satisfy a burning demand from their cus-
tomers. If you are consistently fielding
questions, online or offline, for a partic-
ular product, feature it on your home
page. Even if the product is not out yet,
or you are out of stock currently, don’t
hesitate to promote the product, even if
all you can do is take down their name
and number so you can contact them
when the item is available. 
 What products are you currently over-
loaded or carrying too much inventory
for? Retail stores hold sales all the time,
specifically to clear out older or “dead”
merchandise to make way for newer or
fresh merchandise, and the same can be
said for online stores. If you are sitting
on too much of a specific product, create
some action and excitement by featuring
that product for sale, perhaps reducing
the price for a limited time to match the
promotion. 
 Is the product an introductory item for a
entire category of products you will
carry? There are several products that
are designed with a razor and blades
strategy, meaning you sell them the
razor, or introductory product, cheap,
and make your profit selling the blades,
or accessory products. Similarly, if you
are selling a product that will encourage
additional sales of accessories or extra
products, feature the introductory prod-
uct and hook them in from the begin-
ning. Make sure that there are links from
your featured product page that are
cross-selling or up-selling any of the hot
accessories. 
 What products are generating the most
margin/profit? Let’s face it, if you are
trying to decide between two products
to promote, one of which gets you $5 in
profit, the other gets you $50 in profit, if
all else is equal, pick the product with the
better profit or margin. Even if the higher
profit means it is a tougher product to
sell, the added exposure of a featured
product should help justify the “real
estate” of giving space from your home
page to promote it.
 How long have you been promoting the
same product? If you promote the same
product, over and over, for months on
end, your customers will ignore that pro-
motion, and quite possibly, ignore any
future promotions as well, seeing your
site as stale or static. Featured items get
attention online because, typically, they
are not featured for a long period of time.
Now, if your featured product is experi-
encing high, steady sales, leave it alone
until sales start to drop or you can’t obtain
any more inventory to satisfy orders.
Otherwise, plan to change out your fea-
tured items at regular intervals, whether
it’s every week, every month, every quar-
ter, and so on.

To designate an item as Featured, click on the
Store Editor link from the Merchant Starter
page to bring up your Web store. Click on the
product you wish to promote as Featured. In
the toolbar at the top of the page, you should
see a button marked Special. Click that button
to mark the product as Featured. Then, click
Publish from that toolbar to update your
changes to your store.

Repeat either Step 2 or Step 3 to mark other prod-
ucts as Featured or on sale. Be sure to Publish
your changes before you log out of your account,
in order to save your work. 

Part III
Filling In the Blanks
(and Shelves)

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the process of filling in all the neces-
sary details to make your Web store a reality. I start by
discussing how to build your catalog of products for sale,
and then move into the process of gathering (or creating)
the pictures and descriptions necessary for this product
catalog.
I then expand the discussion by talking about different
functions you could add to your Web store to make the
site more appealing and useful to your customers.
Finally, I discuss how to tie your new Web store into your
existing, or brand new, operations that will handle these
new sales.

W
e’re now going to move the discussion from building your
Web store in general to the core pieces that will make up
the store. In other words, you’ve built the outer walls of your
store, created shelves, hung your sign above the door, and painted
the walls. Now it’s time to fill the shelves with products, add any
special functions to your store, and get everybody ready to handle
the orders.
The first step in this process is setting up your catalog of products
for sale. Your catalog is your store’s essence, after all. Without
something to sell, your store is simply a collection of empty
shelves. Therefore, you want to organize the information that
makes up your product catalog so you can easily make updates
when needed and be able to track your orders to figure out which
product lines to expand and which to eliminate. 
Furthermore, if you set up your catalog correctly, you can take
advantage of newer Internet technologies like RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to
allow your customers (and other Web sites) to get automatic updates every time
you update your catalog so they are seeing only the newest items for sale and not
just everything you are selling. We will discuss how to set up something called an
RSS feed and some of the tools available to distribute your RSS feed automatically.
Defining the Data for Your Catalog
In Chapter 1, we talked about different types of products that you can carry in your
Web store. In this chapter, we are going to talk about different types of information
you need to store about each product for sale. There are a lot of pieces of data that
can make up an item listing, and the more information you keep track of in your cata-
log the more analysis you can do with your incoming orders about what products to
keep or liquidate.

Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
Now, there are some basic pieces of information you should have for every item in
your catalog:

Title: Every product needs to have a title to represent the item in one clear,
concise phrase or sentence. Typically, this title can contain the manufac-
turer name, model number, and type of item — for example Sony XJ-3000 CD
Player. In some cases, like for a book, DVD, or music CD, it will contain the
artist or writer involved.

Description: Every product needs to have at least a few sentences or one
paragraph to explain exactly what the product can do, what benefits the
product offers, and/or a summary of the contents of the product.
In some cases, you may need to have two different descriptions available.
You may need a summary, or brief description, as well as a detailed descrip-
tion. Many times, you can simply use the first sentence or two of your
detailed description as your summary.

Photo: Since you are constructing a Web store, odds are your customers
will never be able to hold the product in their hands, turn it over, or even
“kick the tires.” Therefore, in an Internet environment, a photo is crucial to
successful sales. This is a visual marketplace, as customers want to see
what they are purchasing, even if it is a stock or manufacturer’s photo of
the item.

Price: Every item you sell needs to have an associated price with it,
otherwise, you’re just giving away the store . . . literally! This field should
have the regular retail price you plan on charging your customers for any
given item.

SKU or UPC: In terms of retail products, SKU stands for Stock-Keeping Unit,
while UPC is Universal Product Code. In other words, you should have some
sort of unique label or number that identifies your item. In some cases, this
piece of information may be standard and already created. For example,
every new book published in the US has an ISBN number that identifies that
particular book. You could simply track the ISBN number as your item SKU
or record-keeping number.

Quantity: Before you start selling anything, you need to know how many of
that item you have available to sell. It’s helpful to have your quantity stored
in advance, so you don’t end up selling 10 of something if you have only
three available.
While some e-commerce programs will require additional fields as mandatory or
required, the above fields should be universally required for any Web store to main-
tain. You will know what fields are mandatory for your particular storefront solution
when you try to add a new product because the fields are usually marked with an
asterisk (*), as seen in Figure 9-1. A good piece of advice is to fill in every field 
presented, not just the ones marked as mandatory.

181
Chapter 9: Setting Up Your Catalog of Goods
Figure 9-1: E-commerce providers indicate what fields are required for your catalog.
In addition to the fields in your catalog that you must have, there are some other
fields in your catalog that you should consider having:

Cost: You won’t know if your e-commerce store is truly profitable until you
can calculate the profit per item sold, and for that you need the item cost as
well as the item price so you can compute gross profit.
If your per item cost is questionable (perhaps it was purchased as part of a
large, one-time-payment collection), you can either calculate and put in a
rough average for each unit, or figure out a more appropriate cost based on
the percentage value for that one item in the collection, multiplied by the
cost of the collection. For example, if you paid $1,000 for 20 units, but one
unit was rare enough that it was probably worth 15–20% of the collection
price, your cost could either be $50 (1000/20) or $150–200 (1000 * 15–20%).
Discuss this further with your CPA or accountant.

Attributes: Many of the e-commerce platforms out there allow you to create
an item in your catalog and then assign attributes, rather than creating indi-
vidual items for every attribute you carry. For example, you can define a
2007 T-Shirt item with three color attributes of blue, black, and white, rather
than having to create three different items — 2007 blue T-Shirt, 2007 black
T-shirt, and 2007 white T-shirt. 

182
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
Different attributes to keep track of can include:
• Color
• Size
• Weight
• Model/Make number
• Signed/Unsigned
• Edition/Version/Printing (1st print, 2nd print, special printing, and so on)
If different attributes will affect the price of the item, you will need to store
that price difference as well. For example, if you charge $2 extra for XXL
shirts compared to S-XL, when you store XXL as an attribute you should
store a +$2 to indicate that the price of an XXL shirt is $2 more.

Manufacturer/Designer: In some cases, this information may not be in your
item Title, so you would want to track it in its own field. In other cases, you
want this field so you can run reports or comparisons based on different
manufacturers, independent of the individual items you sell. Many times,
this field is used to define a category.

Category Assignments: If you have multiple items, then you should create
categories that group together similar items. Every item in your catalog
should belong to at least one category (and maybe more), so you need
to identify the category assignment somewhere in your catalog entry for
your item. 

Keywords: Given all the importance placed on search engine results and
placement, it would be helpful to store the specific keyword phrases that
apply to each item in your catalog. This way, they could be included in each
product detail page using techniques like the META tag so the search
engines know which keywords to associate with each product.

Thumbnail Photo: In some cases, you may have to create an additional ver-
sion of your item photo that is resized down to create a thumbnail (pre-
view) photo. Some e-commerce software packages will do this automatically
(like Yahoo! Merchant Solutions), while others (like 1&1 eShops) ask for a
thumbnail and detail photo separately.

Weight: Depending on how you calculate your shipping, it would help you
tremendously to automatically have the weight of the item, so shipping
could be calculated properly instead of being based on averages.

Dimensions: Many of the shipping companies, including the US Postal
Service, now look at the physical dimensions of an item to compute the
shipping cost. Therefore, having the dimensions of your product may
become necessary to figure out an accurate shipping amount.
Understanding RSS Feeds for Your Catalog
In the past, when you wanted to let your customers know that there was a new ver-
sion of your catalog, it typically involved creating a print announcement, mailing out
thousands of glossy catalogs or flyers, and making a big deal to announce any new
changes. Thankfully today, in the “Internet age,” sending out updates is handled in
an automatic fashion using a technology known as RSS.

183
Chapter 9: Setting Up Your Catalog of Goods
RSS has different meanings, depending on which version you are discussing, but it is
typically referred to as Really Simple Syndication. RSS is a group of formats used to
publish content that changes frequently. RSS feeds are documents that contain the
most recently changed content from a website, or the full text with specific notes.
The most typical use of RSS has been for blogs, since that content usually changes
on a daily basis. RSS aggregators receive the different RSS feeds and show their
users the newest content from multiple locations so the user doesn’t have to track
down the changes themselves. Besides blogs, however, there are product search
engines that can be set up to receive RSS feeds from merchants, just like you, so they
can know your product catalog at any given time to give their users a sense of what
products (and prices) you are offering.
Therefore, it’s handy for you to understand the basics of this technology so you can
choose to implement it, especially if you have to update and re-price your catalog
often to keep up with your competitors. Some e-commerce packages have some of
these tools built-in, while other packages rely on you to create and distribute these
files yourself.
Anatomy of an RSS feed
When it comes to products, the RSS feed can be pretty simple. After declaring the
basics of your Web store at the top, the contents of the RSS feed file are simply the
new items in your catalog. You have to declare a title, link, and description for each
item, and you have some choices for additional fields after those three.
For more information on different e-commerce fields you could add to your RSS feed,
check out an example of the Discovery Store’s RSS feed at http://shopping.
discovery.com/erss/.
Here is a sample version of what an RSS feed would look like, including some specific
e-commerce RSS 2.0 specifications:

If you manually create your catalog, like with Microsoft Excel, you could use a basic
text editor and follow the commands given in the sample RSS feed file above.
However, if you use your e-commerce software package to maintain and update your
catalog, you should first look in that package to see if they can automatically create
and send your RSS feed for you. If neither of those options are viable, you can con-
sider using a third-party source for RSS feed creation, such as FeedforAll (www.feed
forall.com). They provide software and tools through their Web site to allow you
to create, edit, and publish your RSS feeds to various search engines.

Using Microsoft Excel to Create Your Catalog File
Once you’ve come up with the different data fields you plan on tracking
in your catalog, it’s time to create a catalog file to store all this informa-
tion. If you have a copy of Microsoft Excel (or any spreadsheet program,
for that manner), you can create your own catalog file.
Toolbox:
 Your product data
(UPC/SKU numbers,
product titles, prices,
and so on)
 A list of your product
data headers
Time Needed:
15–60 minutes
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Start the Microsoft Excel application. When the
program loads, you should see an empty
spreadsheet in front of you. In some cases, you
may be prompted whether you want to create a
new file or open an existing file. If you see that
screen, pick the Create a New File option.
2.
Select File➪Save As and save your new file as
catalog.xls. Later on, you will probably save
your catalog file under a different format, but in
the beginning, have a copy saved as an Excel
spreadsheet so it will retain all the features of a
spreadsheet file and load quicker into Excel for
easy access to you.

186
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
3.
Along the first row of the spreadsheet, enter
names for the different fields you want in your
catalog. The first row of your catalog file is
known as the header row because it contains
the headings of all the columns you wish to
create in your catalog. Give a meaningful name
to each header you wish to create.
The first column should be reserved for your ID or SKU field, whatever will be the unique identifier for your
different products.This way, you can easily sort based on your identifier, and see the different values easily.
Options for Creating Your Catalog File
Thankfully, you have several options to
choose from when it comes to creating your
catalog file, depending on your e-commerce
software platform and what software is
already on your computer. 
Many full-featured software platforms, like
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, ProStores, and
similar vendors will create the catalog file
for you, and allow you to enter information
for each item through guided screens
known as wizards (see Chapters 4 and 5,
where each screen prompts you for certain
item data fields like Name, Quantity, Price,
and other fields).
However, you may want to create your cat-
alog before you start working on your 
e-commerce store, which means you need
to create this independent of your storefront
provider or package, and have a copy on
your local computer. In this case, the most
popular program for small businesses to
use to store their inventory seems to be
Microsoft Excel, which was designed for
financial spreadsheets.
One big reason that many small business
owners use Excel is that they can create spe-
cial versions of a text file, known as Comma
Separated Values files (or .CSV), that can be
easily imported into and exported from
many of the e-commerce software packages
available. Many small business owners
already own a copy of Excel by having
Microsoft Office on their computer, or they
use Excel for their financial needs already,
so they can add a benefit by keeping their
catalog information on Excel as well. Also,
many people enjoy the ease of use and sim-
plicity of storing their catalog information as
a table that they can update without the
need for a sophisticated program.
Microsoft Excel is not your only option for a
locally created catalog file, however. There
are many programs that will help you
design and maintain your own catalog.
While many large corporations use software
like SAP, you can use Microsoft Access or
FileMaker software to create your own cata-
log as a database.

5.
To create a CSV (or Comma
Separated Values) file of your cata-
log data, select File➪Save As and
pick CSV as the file type in the
window prompt. Where it says
Save As Type, click on the down
arrow to bring up a list of options
of different file types. Scroll down
about 10-15 options until you see
CSV (Comma delimited), and click
that option. Then click the Save
button to save the file as a CSV file.
Save as Type option.
4.
Underneath the header row, start entering your
different products, row by row, based on the
SKU or ID number. Make sure that each product
has at least the SKU or ID number, and as much
information as you know to complete the file. If
you have to leave a field blank, that is okay, as
long as it is not the SKU or ID field. Before you
open your store to the public, however, you
should have every essential field completed.
After a while, you should start to have a catalog
file like the one in Figure 5 below. The great
thing about creating your catalog file in Excel is
that, if you ever want to add additional catalog
fields, you just create a new column header in
Excel and fill in the appropriate fields as they
apply to each item. You don’t want to re-order,
re-program, or massively change an already
defined system, or lose your previous data,
when you want to add something new or extra.
187
Chapter 9: Setting Up Your Catalog of Goods
While Microsoft Excel has the capability to store images in their fields, it is better to store the pathname to your
image files in this catalog file rather than storing the actual images in this file. Even if you haven’t created your
images yet, create an image location in this file then use the same naming scheme when you actually create
your catalog photos later.

188
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
7.
If you want to keep working on your catalog file, it is recommended to go back and
do a Save As and save your document as an Excel workbook again. Any changes you
make to this document after saving it as a CSV file will attempt to update the CSV file,
and not the Excel workbook file. Therefore, we have to save the document again as
an Excel workbook so any future updates get saved properly. When you are done
updating your document, you can re-save it as a CSV file to get all the new updates.
6.
Excel will prompt you about whether you want to save this file as a CSV file. Click the
Yes button in both windows as they appear on your screen. Microsoft Excel can store
a lot of different information in their workbook files, but a Comma Separated Value
file can store only one screen’s (or sheet, in Excel terminology) worth of basic text.
Therefore, when you save the file as CSV, Excel warns you that you may lose informa-
tion when you save as a CSV file. Typically, you will not lose any critical catalog data
by doing this step, so click Yes to both.

cient) and save the file as feed.rss.
3.
Scroll down to the Item section of the form. For
each new product you just added to the catalog,
enter the name of that product in the Title box
next to an Item header. Then, enter the URL for
that new product in the Link box. For example,
if you created a product in Yahoo! Merchant

O
nce you have picked out the products to fill your Web store
catalog, it’s time to make those products pop in the eyes,
minds, and wallets of your consumers. The two most sure-fire
ways to capture the shopper’s attention are through clear, crisp
pictures and dynamic, compelling titles and descriptions. Once
you have gotten the visitor to your Web store, your pictures and
descriptions need to convince the visitor to become a customer.
In this chapter, we walk you through the process of gathering the
necessary pictures and copy for your catalog. My goal isn’t to turn
you into a professional photographer, but rather to understand
what customers are looking for (and what you should look for) in
order to make the customers’ experience as clean and easy as pos-
sible. We then take your regular product descriptions and turn
them into action-oriented descriptions that customers and search
engines will enjoy scanning.
Identifying Sources of Pictures and Copy
In many cases, the bulk of this process will already be provided for you. If you are
reselling goods for a manufacturer or distributor, typically there are “stock” or cata-
log photos that you are allowed to use on your Web site, along with the standard
product description, set of features, and additional information. For example, if you
look at Figures 10-1 and 10-2, you can see that Circuit City is re-using Sony’s photos
and description to re-sell the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC S650 Digital Camera.
Just because you are re-selling goods from a major manufacturer, that doesn’t mean
you can automatically go to their Web site and copy all their photos and descrip-
tions to use in your catalog. Check with your wholesaler or distributor to see if there
are any terms or conditions attached to re-using this information. If necessary, con-
tact the manufacturer directly to get permission.

Figure 10-1: Sony has pictures and descriptions for their items . . .
Even when you get permission to re-use a manufacturer’s information, you may
choose to add or enhance the information to fit your Web store. For example, you
may choose to create bullet points of the different features for your initial descrip-
tion, like Circuit City did for the Sony S650 Digital Camera (refer to Figure 10-2), and
then make the full description available by clicking a link to read more.
Never add any information to a standard description unless you know the informa-
tion is 100 percent accurate. Make sure you have the right to truncate or slightly
alter descriptions as well, since some manufacturers want to ensure the customer
gets a full idea of their product and not just “the highlights” you present.
Going one step further, if you are unable to gain full permission to re-use a descrip-
tion, you should be able to provide a link from your Web store to the manufacturer’s
Web site so customers can read up on technical specifications and features. It’s rec-
ommended that, if you do this, the link opens a new browser window so your cus-
tomer still has a window on your Web site and a pop-up window displaying the
technical specifications, which they can close to see your Web site again and order
the product.

Picking the Right Format for Your Pictures
There are lots of options nowadays for taking your own digital photos of your prod-
ucts, as every major camera manufacturer and many computer and electronics
manufacturers have created digital cameras ranging from the sub-$100 entry model
to the high-resolution, professional feature-laden models. You should pick a digital
camera that fits your budget and needs, whether you need a camera that has a lot of
automatic setup features or a camera that lets you zoom and take a crisp shot.
Chances are, however, that you may need professional assistance in turning your
pictures into the high quality images you want to portray with your Web store. In
that case, you may want to hire a professional photographer to take your photos
and prepare them for your Web site.
It’s useful to understand, however, the different file formats that your digital photos
can be stored as, because different formats are suited for different situations.
Specifically, these are the most common file formats:

JPEG format (.jpg): This format, short for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is
considered the standard for the Internet as many images online are saved
using this format. It stores 8 bits of information per color (red, green, and blue)

196
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
and does not take up as much disk space as other photo file formats, which
means it typically loads quicker on a customer’s screen. Every Internet Web
browser knows to load and display a JPEG image in the window, so there are
very few display problems. One of the downsides to the JPEG format is the
loss of quality in the photo, especially if you are going to re-edit and save the
file again. Typically, you would save your photo as a JPEG file when the picture
is ready to be displayed on your Web site and requires no additional editing.

GIF format (.gif): This format, short for Graphic Interchange Format, was the
older standard for how pictures were displayed on the Internet. This format
can store only the most basic 256 colors because it has only a total of 8 bits to
store color information. While most Web browsers can display GIF files easily,
it is typically reserved for the simpler graphics or buttons that don’t require
any complex or animated GIFs (which are a combination of different GIF files
that display in succession providing an animation effect for the viewer).

TIFF format (.tif): This format, short for Tagged Image File Format, is
mainly used for an image when you want to print it instead of posting it on
the Internet. It does store up to 16 bits per color (red, green, and blue) so it
can handle detailed images, and some digital cameras can save the picture
directly as a TIFF with very little loss in quality due to how it compresses
the picture. TIFF files are best suited when you want to use the picture in a
physical print environment (like a flyer, catalog, or brochure) and then you
can convert the file from TIFF to JPEG when you need the photo to be used
on your Web site. (Most Web browsers don’t know how to display TIFF files
properly.) If you think you would ever need to physically print this picture
for any reason, keep a version of the photo in TIFF format.

PSD format (.psd): This format is known as the Photoshop Document format,
named for Adobe’s Photoshop digital software editing tool. Images are stored
in this format when you are using Photoshop to create or edit the picture.
This format stores a lot of additional information that is used by Photoshop
when the image is loaded into the software. In order to view a PSD file, you
need to either have Photoshop installed on your computer or a special file
to view this image. If you plan on using a graphic designer or professional
photographer, it is highly encouraged to keep a version of each image in PSD
format, in case they need to go back and re-use or edit the image again.
Other file formats include:

PSP format (.psp): This format is like the PSD format, but is geared for the
Paint Shop Pro software tool.

PNG format (.png): This is the Portable Network Graphics format, seen as
the successor to the GIF format. Web browsers can display this graphic, but
it isn’t used often.

Raw format (extensions vary depending on camera manufacturer): Some
digital cameras store pictures in this format, which keeps virtually every bit
of data that the camera stores when taking the picture. Unfortunately, not
every image editing software tool knows how to handle this format, and
these files are very large.

BMP format (.bmp): This BitMaP format is exclusively used by Microsoft
Windows to store images within Windows. Some Web sites use an image like
this to control their navigation bar or menu, but it isn’t recommended for
product photos on the Internet.

Chapter 10: Adding Pictures and Copy to Your Catalog
Taking Quality Digital Photos
If you are going to take your own digital
photos of your products for sale, keep the
following points in mind:
 Don’t overload your pictures. Your goal
when taking product photos is to make
the product stand out on its own. For
example, you do not want to crowd too
many objects into one photo to show a
complete collection.
 Beware the Flash. When it comes to
lighting, outdoor (natural) light is the
best. Realistically, you are not going to
photograph your laser printer that is
resting on a cliff overlooking the ocean,
so you will need sufficient indoor light-
ing. Because of this, many people rely on
the flash to provide that light. The down-
side is that the flash can wash out the
colors and, when there is anything
reflective or shiny, provide jarring flash
spots that can be seen as covering up
damage or imperfections. 
 A blank background is better, except for
light-colored items. In most cases, you
want a white background, so the object
itself is more emphasized to the viewer.
The only exception to this rule is lightly
colored items, like diamonds and gem-
stones. Make sure the background high-
lights the product you are shooting, and
add a special background prop, like a
shade, covering, or blank paper to isolate
the product from everything else.
Depending on your digital camera, you
can also set the white balance to Cloudy
(from Auto) to add more warm and bril-
liant colors to your picture.
 Steady your shot. Remember, you are
taking shots of products, not people run-
ning in a marathon. Therefore, you want
your “still” pictures to be focused and
clear. The best investment in this case is
buying a tripod, which stabilizes the
camera on a 3-leg platform.
Another trick is to lower the ISO Shutter
Speed of your digital camera, so the lens
is only “open” for a fraction of a second
to capture the picture.
 Use the highest resolution possible
when shooting.Your digital camera will
have different settings to capture a vary-
ing level of quality for each picture. It is
recommended to take pictures at the
highest resolution your camera offers,
because you can always resize your
photos later to compress them for the
Internet. It is better to resize from a high
quality picture than try to adapt a lower
quality picture. 
 Sometimes,
one 
is 
not 
enough.
Remember, you may not capture every-
thing about your product in one photo-
graph. Your first photo, often used as the
thumbnail photo, should have a front-on
view of the product, but if this is a com-
plex item, you should take multiple
photos of different angles, showing off
different features of the item. The optimal
number of photos for a complex item is
typically 2-4 for an e-commerce setting.
 Macro Mode is a must. Most digital cam-
eras have a special setting known as
Macro, which allows them to focus the
camera when the camera is approxi-
mately one inch away from the surface
of the item they wish to photograph. This
allows for excellent close-up shots,
where you want to highlight any special
functions, the product logo, or any other
details about the product.
 Put it in the middle . . . the product, that
is.When taking a still photo of a product,
you want to position the camera
viewfinder so the item sits in the dead
middle of the picture. You can turn the
item (or the photo) slightly to the side, so
you’re examining the product from an
angle, but make sure the product fills
most of the picture.
 Focus on getting the right focus. If you
rely on the digital camera to automati-
cally focus the item before you take the

Using Action Words to Enhance Your Sales
While a picture can speak a thousand words, it is important to consider the words
you are going to use to describe the products in your catalog as well. When it comes
to writing for the Internet audience, the rules are slightly different than other medi-
ums. On the Web, the focus is on clarity, brevity, grabbing attention, and using the
right keywords. In addition, you’re not just appealing to human visitors. You are also
hoping to use the words in your product titles and descriptions to convince the
search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, to consider your Web store a reputable
source for your store products. That way, they will help recommend your Web site
to potential visitors searching for your store products. 
In short, your descriptions have to pass a “3-part process” to be truly effective. They
have to:
1. Convince the search engines to index your product descriptions, so the
descriptions get stored in their database.
2. Convince a user who finds that product description (by using a search
engine) to check out your store.
3. Convince that same user, now a store visitor, to want to buy a product
from your store.
(continued)
picture, hold the shutter button down
about half-way, wait for the camera to
find the right focus, and then, when the
camera beeps or indicates through the
LCD screen that the focus is there, con-
tinue to press down on the shutter
button until the picture is taken and
stored in the camera.
 Resize to the right size. Since some of
your customers will still be using dial-up
services to access your Web store, you
don’t want to host large versions of your
pictures on your site. Customers who
have to wait for highly detailed pictures
to download, one line at a time, will feel
like they are being “put on hold” and will
most likely leave your store to find
another store whose pictures load
quickly. Therefore, one of your last photo
editing steps should be to resize your
photos to take up less pixels or inches so
it will load quicker.
 Find balance in your photos. Since your
photos are designed to highlight your
products, make sure that there is some
symmetry in your photos. If there is
something large in one half of your pic-
ture, make sure there is something
equally large or important in the other
half.

Digital Photography techniques to cap-
ture your product photos, you can check

Chapter 10: Adding Pictures and Copy to Your Catalog
When you begin to think about writing your product titles and descriptions, try to
make sure that your writing is:

Clear: Don’t beat around the bush when it comes to describing a product.
Just state in plain English what it can do, what benefits it can provide, and
why it’s a good product to buy.

Concise: Use bullet points, numbered lists, and short sentences whenever
possible. White space is your friend. Don’t feel like you have to fill the
screen with text. Use bold and italic words to add emphasis.

To the point: When writing your product description, the first paragraph
should have all the key details of the product. After that, you can list out the
product benefits, features, and/or testimonials. Your goal is that the cus-
tomer completely understands what the product is after reading that first
paragraph.
Once you have written your descriptions to cater to the needs of your human cus-
tomers, it doesn’t hurt to go back and look at everything to make sure your catalog
appeals to that “secondary” customer, the one that relies on the keywords and
hypertext links — the search engines. 
In Chapter 17, we discuss how to get your Web store pages and overall site ready
and able to be interpreted by the search engines. Here, we focus on your product
titles and descriptions, with some basic rules to consider:

Make sure every title and description are consistent. Your goal with
enhancing search engine placement is to associate your product with a spe-
cific keyword phrase that applies to your product. If you use one phrase in
your title, but a slightly different phrase in your description (hoping to
“cover your bases” with two different phrases), the search engines don’t
know which phrase is more relevant, and in the process, neither becomes
relevant, and you lose your placement. You are allowed very little repeti-
tion, so use your keyword phrase once in the title, and one or two times in
the description to make a point.

Don’t overload your descriptions. Keyword stuffing is the act of putting
the same exact keyword phrase too many times in a product description
(or Web page) in hopes of telling the search engine that the phrase is really
representative of the product. Today, the search engines will actually penal-
ize Web sites that practice keyword stuffing, so make sure that your main
keywords are mentioned throughout the description, but not necessarily on
every line or page.

Use the terms your customers are searching for. You may have the greatest
products known to humanity, but if your customers are typing in different
words, acronyms, phrases, or slang to find the product, and you don’t use
those words to describe your product, you are missing out on sales. In other
words, learn the language of your buyers. If they use special acronyms, make
sure those acronyms are part of your product titles and descriptions.
Use sites like www.wordtracker.com and Yahoo!’s Search Marketing tool
(http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/?mkt=us) to find the most 
popular keyword searches and phrases, and incorporate the top ones into
appropriate product descriptions.

W
hen you build an e-commerce Web store you should
always make sure the core of your site (your catalog and
products) are set up correctly, which is what we spent the last two
chapters discussing. If you want to move your store to the next
level, however, you need to provide more than just commerce —
you need to provide some functionality that engages your cus-
tomer, gets them more involved in the process, and gives them
something extra beyond the item in the box. As more and more 
e-commerce sites compete for the customer’s business, it’s usually
those companies that provide something extra that win out or
sustain their revenue.
There are a lot of different ways you can enhance your Web store
to add this functionality. The basic level of functionality should
already be present, where customers can pick multiple items
from you, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout and pay
without interaction or communication from you, the store owner.
Additional functions increase the “interactive” nature of business,
where customers get to interact with you, your employees, and
your other customers more easily and naturally.
In this chapter, we look at the most common (or usual) functions that Web store
owners like to add to their site — customer accounts, search engines, and discus-
sion boards. We then give some hands-on instructions on how to implement these
functions on your Web site. Please understand that these functions are by no means
the only functions available to your Web store. For all the functions available to your
Web store, we encourage you to consult with your e-commerce storefront provider
and see what functions are standard with your package, as well as what functions
cost extra but can be plugged into your store setup.
Understanding Customer Accounts
There’re several reasons why you may want your customers to have the ability to
log into a special account, created just for them, on your Website. Offering customer
accounts means you can store each customer’s personal information in a protected
way so other customers can’t view it. This allows a customer to store their financial

information, like their credit card info, so it’s very easy for them to place future orders
and pay for them. The best example of this is Amazon.com, which allows “1-click”
ordering for their products because every Amazon customer has to store a credit card
in their account and pay for every order with that credit card. They offer lots of func-
tionality in their customer accounts, as you can see in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1: Amazon gives customers lots of functions in their account.
Quick payment isn’t the only reason to have customer accounts, however.
Sometimes, you may want to add exclusive content that is meant for only your
paying customers and/or registered users, and the only way to ensure this exclusiv-
ity is to hide the content on a Web page that requires your customers to log in and
view it. As long as you provide something with value, like extra articles, product
previews, exclusive announcements on upcoming merchandise, or even the first
chance to order a new product, customers should be willing to file their personal
contact information with you.
Some companies earn extra revenue by taking this concept one step further and
offering “subscriptions” to their Web site. That is where customers pay a monthly
fee for exclusive access to special sections of that Web site. One good example is
The Wall Street Journal, who even charges their print subscribers an extra fee to
read articles posted only on their subscriber Web site.
Customer accounts give you, the store owner, several benefits that can be worth the
time and cost of creating this functionality. First and foremost, you get detailed
access to your customer’s information, from their personal demographics to order
and purchase history. This can be very helpful when planning future product lines or
predicting upcoming sales. 

207
Chapter 11: Building Your Store Features and Functions
Secondly, you begin to develop brand loyalty with your customers. If they went to
the trouble of creating their account and get used to accessing it, now there is a
“cost” if they leave your store and go to someone else’s Web site. You make it easier
for them to shop with you and you give those customers benefits or perks to encour-
age repeat buying. This ongoing relationship between you and your customers is
what truly builds a business.
Lastly, customer accounts give you an excellent field for testing or trying out new
promotions. You can offer limited sales to your registered customers, or roll out a
new promotion to your customers first, without alerting your casual Web store visi-
tor. You can study the effects of that sale or promotion and decide whether to roll it
out on a larger scale, without a lot of upfront investment.
Putting a Search Engine on Your Store
When it comes to doing business on the Internet, people are trained to search. Many
Internet users have Google or Yahoo! bookmarked as their starting page, and start
every Web session by searching for what they need.
This need to search has invaded the e-commerce arena as well, where some cus-
tomers will ignore the featured items and navigation bar, and simply perform one
search to see if the product they need is available on your Web store.
Therefore, more and more Web stores are adding a search box capability to their
Web site, and placing it either on the home page near or inside their navigation bar,
or they are placing it on every single Web page within their site, so search is always
readily available for their customers. While some e-commerce software packages
already offer a built-in search box, others don’t. Later in this chapter we look at how
to add a simple search box using one of the biggest names in searching . . . Google.
Bringing Discussion Boards to Your Store
Sometimes, the key thing your customer is searching for is not a physical product,
but some advice, recommendations, or information provided by another human
being, whether it’s you (the store owner), a store employee, or simply another cus-
tomer. On the Internet, there are several mechanisms that can provide customers
this interaction on a virtual level, and the main way is called a discussion board.
Also known as message boards or bulletin boards, discussion boards allow anyone to
start a conversation (known on the board as a thread) and then have replies to that
conversation appended to the initial reply. Users can search the discussion board
for previous conversations that they’re interested in, and get involved with current
discussions that could range from technical support to their favorite products to
asking the staff for their recommendation or advice.

208
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
Discussion boards have evolved into the “next level” of technical support for many
Web sites because not only can members search past threads for an explanation on
how to fix a common problem, but if you really get your customers actively using
your discussion boards, these customers will start answering other customer’s
questions about your Web store before you or your employees can respond. A per-
fect example of this in action is on the eBay Community page (shown in Figure 11-2),
where hundreds of discussion boards are monitored and filled with eBay buyers and
sellers helping other buyers and sellers with their questions without eBay customer
service getting involved.
While it can be simple to add this technology to your web store, you shouldn’t add
this function unless you’re prepared to spend some time in the beginning to use the
boards, respond to customer questions, and post new information on a regular basis.
It can reflect negatively on your Web store if your discussion boards are empty or not
used for long periods of time, or even worse, initial discussions go unanswered . . . by
anyone! Given some time and encouragement, however, your customers should start
to use it more regularly.
Figure 11-2: eBay provides discussion boards for new sellers, part-time sellers, and more.

Adding Customer Accounts to Your Web Store
You have several options when it comes to adding customer accounts.
You can simply require a user ID and password to access part of your
Web store, which you would give to any customer who wants an
account. You could implement software to allow any customer to create
their own unique account name and password, and have functionality
tied to that specific customer ID. If you just want to set up a “members-
only” area of your Web site, you need to create a password-protected
section of your Web site. Some e-commerce packages, like Yahoo!
Merchant Solutions, have this capability built into the package.

Adding Dynamic Customer Accounts
If you want to add the ability for customers
to create their own accounts, monitor and

advanced functionality, then you need to
install a custom software package to
help facilitate this. Consult your storefront
provider to see what programming lan-
guages are supported on your Web site, and
whether they have any special promotions
with companies that provide these functions.
Many times it’s the shopping cart software
that will have the ability to add customer
accounts. After all, your customer has to
enter their information the first time they
order something from you, so your shopping
cart software may have a module where the
customer places their order and creates an
account on your system, simply by adding a
password in the order form and agreeing to
store their information for future use.

asked to give Google some basic information
about your Web store. You’ll need to create a
name for your search box, a description, and
keywords. I would gear this information to your
Web store and use your basic store description
and keywords to answer the fields provided.
When you scroll down this page, you’ll be asked
to enter Web sites that you want to be searched
by customers when they use this new search

Chapter 11: Building Your Store Features and Functions
Adding a Discussion Board to Your Web Site
There are two main ways to add a discussion
board to your Web store. The first way is to
install the software so the discussion board
resides on your Web site. You should consult
your e-commerce storefront provider to see
what programming languages and software
are supported on your Web store. Your
provider may have a partner agreement to
install this functionality on your Web site or
know a good software package that their
other customers have used.
Many storefront providers support pro-
gramming languages like PHP and Perl, and
therefore you can take advantage of soft-
ware from companies such as:
 vBulletin (www.vbulletin.com): Paid
software
 PHPbb (www.phpbb.com): Free open
source software
 IP.Board (www.invisionpower.com):
Paid software
 Ikonboard (www.ikonboard.com): Free
software
 Discus (www.discusware.com): Paid
and free software
The second way to add discussion board to
your Web store is to use a provider that
hosts the forums on their Web site, not
yours. This method is much easier to add,
since you simply provide a link from your
Web store to the specially created forum
section of their Web site, geared for your
users. There is nothing to install, and you
don’t have to worry about Web space or
bandwidth concerns affecting your main
Web store. 
There are several vendors to choose from,
including:
 Atomic Boards (www.atomicboards.
com)
 Board Nation (www.boardnation.com)
 BoardHost (www.boardhost.com)
 eZBoard (www.ezboard.com)
 Hostboard (www.hostboard.com)

218
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
4.
In the final step, you need to answer some
questions about your Web site, what category
your board will fall into, and a name for your
discussion board. Simply fill out the prompts.
You can create any name you want, but I highly
suggest putting your Web store name in the
title so people know what is associated with
the discussion board. When you have finished
entering the information, click the Submit
button at the bottom of the page.
3.
You’ll need to finish creating your account, and the amount of information you provide depends on
whether you choose a Paid or Free account. If you choose a Free account, you should see a screen
similar to the one in the figure on the left, where you have to enter your name and provide a phone
number where you are available at that moment. Once you enter the information, you will get a
phone call (or text message) with a verification code needed to complete the process. If you choose
a paid account and are signing up for the 14-day free trial, then you’ll see a screen similar to the one
in the figure on the right. You simply provide your name and click the Continue button to finalize the
process.

ing the board.

Click the link for your new discussion board
and examine it. Of course, your discussion
board is empty to begin with, so you may want
to kick off the festivities by posting an introduc-
tory message, explaining the purpose and
ground rules of the discussion board, so your
customers have a good starting point.
When you link to this discussion board, you should open this function in a new window, so your users still have
a web browser window pointed to your store, in case they want to go back and place another order or use your
store immediately after participating in the discussion.

I
n the frenzy, or excitement, of setting up all your Web store
operations, it’s important not to lose sight of the final piece of
the puzzle — the real world back office (the everyday pieces that
keep your Web store operational) component of your store. This
includes everything from your accounting to your inventory man-
agement to shipping and handling your products. While a lot of
steps have translated onto the Internet, when you are reselling
physical products, there are some steps that have to be handled
offline, which is where your back office comes into play.
In this chapter, we focus mainly on your shipping and handling
operations, since many of you probably won’t need a sophisticated
inventory management system, and many of you will set up your
own accounting mechanisms through a local CPA, accountant, or
using your computer with a program like QuickBooks. We start by
looking at the various shipping companies (for companies in the
U.S.) and comparing benefits as well as online options. We walk
through, step-by-step, how to create accounts with several of these companies and
how to order supplies and print your first sample label. We also talk about shipping
international orders, and the customs forms that come into play there.
Understanding Your Shipping 
Company Options
After your customer places their order on your Web store and the thrill of immediate
gratification kicks in, an invisible clock starts ticking. That clock is tied to your cus-
tomer, who wishes that their order had already arrived in their mailbox, and waits
(patiently, we hope) for that order to come. Over time, that clock ticks louder, and so
does that customer, as they begin to inquire about their package status. Therefore,
it’s important to pick a shipping company that is responsive, quick, and offers their
customers tracking capabilities at all steps of the shipment process.
Thankfully, all of the main shipping companies in the U.S. offer rich online tools for
you to manage your shipping needs. Some of them go one step further and are able
to integrate with your e-commerce shopping cart programs, sales programs, and
storefront providers to instantly feed orders into their systems to create shipping
labels.

Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
In order to take advantage of any of these shipping company options, you should con-
sider investing in a high quality scale that can accurately weigh your packages. If you
mail light items, anywhere from a 5 to 100 pound scale should be sufficient. If you sell
bulkier items, like electronics, you should get a 150 or 300 pound industrial scale.
When it comes to picking a shipping company to handle your needs, consider the
features you’ll most likely use:

Online label creation: Waiting in line at the post office (or a shipping
counter) is no longer a day-to-day requirement for an e-commerce store
owner. Every major shipping company now offers their customers the abil-
ity to print out shipping labels that you can stick to your packages and hand
off to the shipping company. These labels are generated online, your credit
card is billed for the total, and usually your customers get an e-mail with
their tracking information automatically, which is one less step for you to
worry about in your day-to-day operations.

Tracking capabilities: The first step is getting a tracking number generated
when you are going to send a customer order. With companies such as UPS,
FedEx, or DHL, that is automatically done. With the US Postal Service, you
can request Delivery Confirmation, which tracks acceptance and delivery of
a package, or Signature Confirmation, which requires the customer (or some-
one at that address) to sign for the package. When the package is being
sent, your customers can input their tracking or Delivery Confirmation
number online and see the status of their order.

Address book: When you start seeing repeat customers placing orders (or
you sell products on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis) you will want the
capability to store and retrieve customer’s addresses and information in an
address book so you do not have to re-type that information when it is time
to ship out another package. In addition, if you plan to send out catalogs,
promotional mailers, or other information to past customers, you want an
easy way to retrieve that mailing list.

Reports and shipping history: In case you ever need to go back and review
a shipment that has been made, it’s helpful to have all your shipping infor-
mation retrievable through a reporting or history function instead of dig-
ging through a pile of receipts from manually sending off packages at the
post office. In addition, if you want to review your costs, identify patterns in
shipping, and try to optimize that part of your business, it will be helpful to
have your past history available at your fingertips.

Order pick-up: Once you’ve generated your labels and prepared your pack-
ages, the last step is getting the boxes to the shipping company. Some com-
panies, like UPS, FedEx, and DHL, offer automatic daily or weekly pickup
based on your order volume and allow you to order a pick-up when labels
are generated. The US Postal Service offers a service called Carrier Pick-up,
where you specify a 2-hour window for the postman to come and retrieve
your packages. If you set up an account with UPS or FedEx, work with your
account representative to get a daily or weekly pick-up included with your
account for free. Typically, they’re looking for a steady stream of packages,
and may offer that on a trial basis until you can establish a suitable monthly
average of packages to justify a continued free daily or weekly pickup
option for your account.

223
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Back Office
The main shipping companies in the U.S.
When it comes to the main shipping companies available to small businesses in the
United States, there are four that deserve mention:

Federal Express (FedEx): When it absolutely, positively has to get there,
FedEx is the company that will make it happen. They’re well known for their
high levels of customer service, and reach hundreds of countries around
the world. They offer many levels of service, from their Next Day Air (with
Early Morning Drop-off available in some cases) to Ground Residential and
Business services. They have a robust online site and a Shipping Manager
tool to help you organize your shipments. 
FedEx is now available in thousands of locations in the U.S. due to their pur-
chase of Kinko’s Copy and Print shops a while back. This means you can drop
off your packages at a nearby Kinko’s (in some cases, 24-hours a day) or have
your packages processed at a Kinko’s and billed to your FedEx account.
On average, FedEx Express costs more than other companies, but their newer
Ground service is competitive with UPS Ground and offers coast-to-coast
ground shipping in an average of 4 business days. When you sign up to get an
account with FedEx, you can save up to 15 percent off the normal rates.

UPS: The King of Shipping, Brown can do a lot for you. UPS claims to ship
more packages for e-commerce related purposes, like eBay purchases, than
any other shipping company around. Like Federal Express, UPS has an
extensive reach to hundreds of countries around the world and offers a
wide array of shipping options, from Next Day air to the very popular UPS
Ground service. When it comes to online operations, UPS has invested heav-
ily in their software, which means their UPS WorldShip software has the
most integration options with lots of leading software and e-commerce
storefront providers. Their online services with My UPS allow you to gener-
ate labels and inform your customers as to their tracking numbers.
UPS is available in over 3,000 locations in the U.S. due to their purchase of
Mail Boxes Etc. (now the UPS Store) back in 2003. You can drop-off your
already-prepared packages at a UPS Store, but if you plan to have them pack
and ship your items for you, be prepared to pay a mark-up over your online
UPS rates. In addition, you can drop off your already-prepared packages at
office supply stores like Office Depot or Staples and enjoy UPS counter rates
when they process your packages for you.
When it comes to a major shipping company, UPS rates are competitive with
similar companies like FedEx and DHL. UPS Ground is typically cheaper
than some US Postal Service rates (like Parcel Post), and unlike the US
Postal Service offers a guaranteed delivery date and better tracking capabil-
ities. When you sign up for a UPS account, you can qualify for some busi-
ness discounts based on your shipping volume and current promotions.

US Postal Service (USPS): Through rain, sleet, snow, or damaged packages,
the Post Office is there to deliver your packages. They’re a big supporter of
e-commerce, especially eBay, where the post office has co-branded certain
boxes with the online auction giant and offers integration with eBay and

224
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
PayPal for their users to ship packages. The Post Office has recently stream-
lined their systems, offering four main shipping options, from Express Mail
to Priority Mail to First-Class and Parcel services, depending on your speed.
Their reach can’t be beat, as they will ship your package to any known
country in the world. Their online operations allow you to print out your
own shipping labels, and they work with companies like Stamps.com and
Endicia that also print out specialty shipping labels for the Post Office.
There are thousands of post offices across the U.S. where you can drop off
your packages or have them process your packages, at retail counter rates.
In addition, if you prepare your labels online, you can drop some of your
packages at the tens of thousands of blue drop boxes. Due to security
concerns, any International package over one pound must be handed to
a postman or retail agent, for example.
Typically, the US Postal Service offers the cheapest rates of the main
providers, depending on service. Their tracking capabilities are improving,
but are nowhere in detail like UPS or FedEx, and typically you pay extra for
tracking or signature capabilities. While UPS or FedEx will promise ship-
ments in a number of days, USPS relies on “averages” of 2–3 days for
Priority Mail, and 1–3 weeks for Parcel Post or Media Mail. While the Postal
Service will go to any country in the world, as of May 14, 2007, they will only
ship that package via air mail, putting the cost on the same magnitude as
UPS or FedEx, and additional services, such as Insurance or Proof of
Delivery, vary by country.

DHL: You have probably seen their yellow vans zipping around town, but
perhaps wondered who they are or what they represent. They are DHL, one
of the largest shipping companies in the U.S., with extensive operations out-
side the U.S. as well. Unlike the other “big 3” shipping companies mentioned
above, DHL focuses primarily on the business customer. You can’t walk into
a DHL office and process a shipment; you have to establish a DHL account
first. They also offer an array of Air and Ground options for their customers,
and offer an online site and software for your computer to process orders
and create shipping labels.
While there are no retail locations to use DHL, they have offices in every
city and maintain delivery routes to many locations, relying on the US
Postal Service for rural deliveries. You need to consult their Web site
(www.dhl.com) to set up an account and get assigned to a delivery route.
DHL can be very competitive with the other shipping companies, and they
are hungry for your business. Your rates will depend on distance and
volume, but check your bills and watch out for additional fees and sur-
charges, like a Residential Delivery Charge. Their account representatives
are pretty responsive, and insurance claims are sometimes much smoother
to process with DHL than with other companies.
Picking your shipping company
In some cases, the question of which company to pick is moot, as you’ll probably
want to establish accounts with multiple companies based on different needs. As
mentioned in the previous section, there are some countries in the world where UPS

225
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Back Office
and FedEx don’t go, which requires using the US Postal Service. In addition, compa-
nies like FedEx won’t deliver packages to P.O. Boxes, which some customers may
give you as their only shipping address. In those cases, you’d have to rely on the US
Postal Service as well.
There is the question, however, of which shipping company deserves the majority of
your business. Using a different shipping company every day would be counter pro-
ductive to your business and save you nothing, as the best discounts come from
being loyal to one shipping company. Given the choices out there, here are some
questions to consider when making that decision:

Which company works best with my Web store infrastructure? Depending
on the storefront provider and the software you are using to build your
Web store, this question alone may help you make your final decision.
Companies like UPS have invested heavily to make sure their software
works directly with your storefront provider, and as your company grows,
you’ll want to automate as much as possible, especially this step. Pick a
company that will link with your operations and require as little interven-
tion from you as possible.

How much do I expect to ship, and to where? When you set up a business
account with any of these shipping companies, they’re going to ask you for
an estimate of the volume you expect to generate, and the percentage of
your shipments that go out Air/Express, Ground, and International. When
you are starting-up, advise the company that you are providing estimates
and not actual numbers, as you can always re-evaluate your account in 6-12
months and see if you qualify for a better rate. Based on your volume and
mix of destinations, companies can offer you specific rates which you can
compare based on the weight of an average order and the zones of the U.S.

How many options do I want to offer my customers? As mentioned before,
customers want their order quick, and because of this, some customers
are willing to pay extra to get their order faster than other customers.
Therefore, you are highly advised to offer different shipping methods, such
as Next Day Air, 2 Day Air, and Ground service, for example, and charge
appropriate rates for each service. When offering Next Day Air service,
be sure to establish a cut-off time when orders must be received, as most
companies require a Next Day package to be at their offices by mid- to late-
afternoon in order to guarantee delivery the next day. Build in a window of
time to receive the order, package it, and get it to your shipping company.
As long as we are talking about choice, the other reason you probably want to estab-
lish accounts with multiple companies is that some customers want a choice of ship-
ping carrier, not just the shipping method and speed of delivery. Typically, offering
two companies to choose from is enough variety for most e-commerce store owners,
and usually, one of those choices is the US Postal Service (due to their exclusive
delivery to P.O. Boxes and certain International destinations). Most shipping
accounts are free to establish and maintain, unless you pay for daily pickup or other
advanced options.

226
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves) 
Shipping international orders
Thanks to the power of the Internet, your next order could come from Boston or
Bangalore. Web stores are enjoying access to a global marketplace, which can mean
increased interest and a bigger audience to support your business. When it comes
to order fulfillment, however, it can also mean knowing a little something about the
customs forms and requirements for shipping orders outside your country.
Thankfully, the shipping companies have responded to this increased demand in
international shipments by augmenting the services they offer and integrating the
necessary information into the documents and labels they create that you print out
and attach to your packages. 
When dealing with your international orders, here are some things to keep in mind:

Country-specific restrictions: In many countries, the postal service there is
controlled by the government, which means that certain countries have
specific restrictions on weight, size, and types of items that can be sent to
citizens of that country. In addition, the tracking capabilities vary by coun-
try, as some of them inspect packages before final delivery to the customer,
which can affect delivery time. Consult the shipping company’s Web site for
specific information regarding country-specific limits and restrictions.

Customs forms: Today, all the major shipping companies will print out the
customs documentation to go with your shipping label. They’ll ask you to
provide additional information, so have this information ready when you
prepare an international shipping label:
• Quantity and description of each item in the package.
• Value of each item in the package.
• Country of origin of each item in the package.
• Type of package (Gift, Documents, Commercial Sample, or Other).
For even more detailed information on how to complete the advanced
paperwork to ship packages overseas, consult the U.S. government’s Export
Web site at www.export.gov.
Creating Your Online Shipping Accounts
When you have decided on the shipping company (or companies) where you want
to set up your business shipping accounts, the next step is to sit down in front of a
computer, log in, and create your accounts. 
For several of these companies, like FedEx and UPS, the registration is actually two
parts: signing up for an account with the shipping company, and signing up for an
online account with their Web site.

227
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Back Office
Before you actually log on, however, you should have some information ready to be
entered:

Average number of packages: Almost every carrier will ask you what your
average shipments are, either per week or per month. If you are starting
out, then think of an estimate of what you plan or hope to achieve within
one to two months’ time. This number can always be changed or updated
later, but it’ll be used when your account is created to determine features
like daily pickup fees (if any).

Form of payment: For many of these companies, putting a credit card on
file is sufficient. In some cases, you may set up a billing invoice system
where your accounting department will receive and pay invoices sent by
the shipping company.

Business address: If you plan to process your shipments in a warehouse,
remember to give that address as the pick-up location and business address
whenever possible. The last thing you want is your delivery driver coming
to get 100 boxes from your apartment or house when they are sitting at
your warehouse.

Signing Up with Federal Express
The first shipping company we’ll look at is Federal Express, or FedEx for
short. The overnight delivery company has grown over the past 50 years
into a global shipping partner that handles all sizes of accounts. When we
sign up with FedEx, we’re actually doing two separate things: We’re creating
a FedEx account, good for shipping packages with FedEx, and an account
with fedex.com, which allows us to use their online Shipping Manager to
create labels for shipments.

You’ll be asked to create a user ID to use when
logging into fedex.com. Your user ID and pass-
word must each be six or more characters long,
and FedEx requires your password to contain at
least one letter and one number. Pick some-
thing hard for others to guess for the password.
Once you’re done, click the Continue button to
proceed.
5.
Now you need to establish your FedEx shipping
account, separate from the Web site. If you have
already set up a FedEx account (perhaps for a
retail business) and you want to use it for your
Web store (or you want to combine your retail
and Web store operations), simply input your
existing FedEx number in the box provided and
you do not need to create a second account.
I’m assuming you don’t have a FedEx shipping
account, so if that is the case, select the Open a

FedEx asks you to log into their Web site to
continue. Unless you already have an account,
click the Sign Up Now! link to continue. You’re

The next step involves providing your credit
card information to be linked to the account.
Here, you’re asked to keep a Visa, Mastercard,

FedEx asks for your Contact Information for the

can input that here.

Signing Up with UPS
The second shipping company we’ll look at is United Parcel Service, known
as UPS. The company has become the world’s largest package delivery
service and has an extensive department to help with logistics and enter-
prise shipping needs. They created their own software system called
WorldShip, which you can access through their Web site to generate labels
for your packages. Similar to FedEx, we’ll be establishing two types of
accounts: a UPS account number and an account to use on their Web site to
generate labels for shipments. 
Stuff You 
Need to Know
2.
In this part, you’re setting up an account for
access to their Web site. Fill in the blanks as
prompted to put in your name, e-mail, user ID,
and password. Your password needs to be
between 6 and 10 characters long. Once you’re
done, click the Next button to continue the
process.

Go to the UPS home page at www.ups.com and
select your country. Once you get your coun-
try’s home page, click on the Register button to
get started. From here, you can access and read
more about lots of different UPS functions,
based on your needs. To sign up for an account,
look for the Register button in the top-right of
the screen.
Click this button.

At the bottom portion of the form, UPS wants to
know the decision-making level of the person
creating the account (onscreen this is Section 5)
and then asks for that person to review the
Terms and Conditions of having a My UPS
account. Check the box indicated to signal your
approval of the terms and click Next to 
continue.
4.
As you scroll down from the Contact
Information section, you’ll see the areas to
indicate your preferred shipping method,
e-mail contact options, and payment options.
Your Service and Packaging options here are
simply going to be the defaults when you log
into your account to make labels. Pick the
options you plan to use most often, but know
that these can be changed for any shipment.
3.
In order to create your account to use UPS
online, they need to have your full set of con-
tact information. Fill out the different fields as
prompted, as the required fields are marked
with the diamond character.

234
Part III: Filling In the Blanks (and Shelves)

In the first step of this part, UPS
needs to know your average ship-
ping needs. Fill in the blanks based
on your estimated packages per
week sent and any other shipping-
related questions. Click the Next
button to proceed.
6.
You have created your account for accessing
My UPS online and are presented with a con-
firmation screen. Now you need to create
your UPS shipping account that will be used
when you ship with UPS. Click the Next
button to proceed.
When letting UPS know your average shipping needs, do not sign up for a Daily Pickup unless you think you
have the volume to justify it, which is about 3-5 packages per day.You can always work with your UPS account
representative to add this later.

changes. When you are done, go down to the bottom of the
page and click the blue Next button to create your account.
8.
At this stage, UPS needs to set up the billing profile for your UPS shipping account. You
can either file to have UPS send you a bill every week, which will require a credit check
of your business or personal assets, or you can put a valid credit card on file, which UPS
would use to bill you weekly. Fill in the appropriate fields and click Next to proceed.
10. Your new UPS shipping account has been cre-
ated! You’ll see a confirmation screen, and be
sure to make a note of your new account
number. You’ve now completed the process and
can log into UPS and create shipping labels that
will be billed against your UPS shipping
account.

Signing Up with the US Postal Service
The last company we’ll look at is the United States Postal Service, or USPS
for short. The Post Office is the only shipper that can guarantee you can
mail a package to any country in the world. They also have a Web site
where you can generate your own shipping labels for packages. Unlike
FedEx or UPS, however, you don’t get a special account number to use
whenever shipping packages, and there is no concern about average ship-
ping volume, because the Post Office already comes to your door every day
to deliver mail, regardless of your package volume. Be aware that not all
shipping methods are available through printing a label online, such as First
Rate International.

This step is about gathering all the contact infor-

your personal information and location informa-
tion. I highly recommend putting in your location
where packages will be picked up from, not nec-
essarily your mailing address. When you are
done, click the Continue button to proceed.
4.
In this step, you’re asked to identify your
account as a Personal or Business account. If
you plan on taking advantage of certain busi-
ness services, like Business Reply Mail or bulk
mail features, then sign up as a Business
account now. If you’re just starting up, selecting
a Personal account will allow you to create
labels and do all the essential functions. There
are no extra fees for picking either option, so
you may want to go ahead and select Business.
3.
In this step, choose a user ID and password to
access the USPS Web site. The US Postal Service
has slightly stricter standards for creating a
password than other shipping companies. Your
password must have at least one upper case
character, one lower case character, and one
number. Click the Continue button to proceed.

shipping labels, they will prompt you to add
a credit card to your profile so you can be
billed for creating these labels.

Printing Out a Sample USPS Label
In order for your new USPS account to be useful, your first action with
the account should be to print a sample label, so you’re not diagnosing
problems when a pile of packages is sitting waiting to be dropped off.
The USPS uses a programming language called Java through your web
browser to generate a window with your label, which you can send to
your printer. Be aware that, when printing labels through USPS, you will
need to allow popup windows to occur from usps.com.

Log into your USPS account (at www.usps.com)
and click on the Click-N-Ship link. You’re taken
to the Click-N-Ship page. Notice there is a link to
print a sample Domestic or International label.
Click either of those links.
Printing Out a Sample Label
Once you’ve gone through the trouble of
setting up an account, you want to make
sure that you can print out your shipping
labels without any trouble. Of course, before
we can test anything, you should decide
what kind of printer you want to use to
create your shipping labels. Every shipping
company can now print labels on your reg-
ular inkjet or laser printer, so if you already
have a printer and don’t plan on a heavy
volume this will satisfy your needs.
However, if you expect a large volume of
orders and you’re still buying equipment for
your shipping station, you may want to look
into buying a label printer. These are spe-
cialty printers (from companies like Zebra,
Eltron, and Pitney-Bowes) that are designed
for functions like printing shipping labels.
Companies like UPS will even provide you
with rolls of these specialty labels to use in
printing your shipping labels. These printers
are designed for large volume operations,
and the peel-and-stick nature of these labels
means one less step for your shipping team.

Review the label that comes out
and make sure it printed correctly.
If everything is fine, click Yes to the
question the USPS asks you about
the label and they’ll know your
printer is ready to handle their
labels.
2.
USPS will detect if you have the right software
installed to handle their labels. If not, they’ll
prompt you to do a one-time software down-
load. USPS uses Adobe PDF technology to
create their domestic labels, and Java technol-
ogy to create their international labels, with
customs forms integrated into the label.
3.
Once the software is on your system, USPS will
automatically open a print window showing
you a sample of the printout. Make sure the
correct printer is selected that will handle your
labels, and click the OK button to test it out.

Part IV
Finalizing Your Web Store

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the essential steps for you, a Web
store owner to take right before you launch your store
on the Internet. I discuss tactics to organize all of your
online and physical materials to point to your new Web
store. I then move into the process of quietly opening your
Web store to test all the bugs and functionality and inviting
a select group of shoppers to sign on and try to order
something.
Finally, I go through all the last-minute steps you should
take to proof-read and double-check your Web store for
accuracy and professionalism. I also recommend steps to
verify your Web store design looks the same, regardless of
Internet browser or operating system used by your clients.

A
fter spending time doing the “heavy lifting” of designing
and implementing the core of your Web store, it’s time to
start focusing on the “last touch” elements — the parts of the
process that will promote your overall business and not just nec-
essarily affect your catalog or one product category.
In this chapter, we discuss one of the simplest, but most important
parts of your business success — getting your business name men-
tioned in as many places as possible. Specifically, we want to pro-
mote your Web store URL, or Web address, that customers will
type in to get to your Web store. So, we look at ways and places
you can promote your store in the real and virtual worlds, as well
as how to mention your Web store in any online sales activities.
Updating Your Literature and Signs
In order for people to know about your Web store, they have to see your Web store
name or URL so they can go to your Web store and see it for themselves. Therefore,
you need to use every avenue you can to make your URL known. Thankfully, there
are a lot of mechanisms you already use and control that require a simple update or
addition to accomplish this.
With all the technology we use every day, there is still a lot of paper (and plastic and
canvas and more) that we use, hand out, interact with, or see on a daily basis. Any
“physical” or tangible material that you create and use to promote or do your busi-
ness can be updated to mention your Web store URL, so next time you plan to order
more business cards or catalogs, don’t forget this addition. We’ve put together a
checklist of places where you can take advantage of this opportunity to promote
your Web store, so check it out!

Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
When including your Web store URL, you can typically drop the http:// part and
just focus on including your actual domain of www.yourname.com instead.

Business cards: This is probably the easiest and most obvious mention, but
interestingly enough, many Web store owners overlook this one. If you don’t
have business cards yet, go get some, and make sure your Web store URL is
included. Typically, they can go at the bottom of the card, as shown in
Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: Include your Web store URL in your business cards.

Sales or promotional flyers: If you are going to promote a sale on your Web
store, people have to find it, right? In this case, you may want to promote a
specific Web page or subdirectory of your Web store, so here you might put:
www.yourname.com/sale instead of www.yourname.com.

Brochures: Whenever putting together any company literature, regardless
of who the end customer is, you want to put your Web store URL in there.
The point of a brochure is to give someone a set amount of information and
then encourage that person to learn more by taking an action. Today, the
easiest action you can take is pointing someone to your Web site.

Catalogs: If you already publish print catalogs, or are planning on publish-
ing print catalogs to supplement your Web store, you definitely have to pro-
mote your Web store, even if the catalog is mail or phone order. The more
options you give your customers, the more likely they are to order from
you, and if you are training people to shop from you via a catalog, they’re
the easiest to transition to a Web store because, let’s face it, a Web store is
simply an online catalog.

Newsletters: Print or e-mail newsletters are an excellent way to keep in
touch with your customers, employees, partners, and/or vendors. Even

247
Chapter 13: Putting Your Web Store at the Hub of Your Sales
though the newsletter will typically be about you or your Web store, it
never hurts to remind people of your Web store URL somewhere (or in two
or three places) in your newsletter.

Physical displays/signs: If you’ve got a physical retail store, or perhaps set
up a booth at a trade show or convention, don’t forget to advertise your
Web store on any physical displays or signs you have. Even though the cus-
tomer is in front of you for that first sale, you want them to become a repeat
customer, and the best way for that to happen is to remind your “offline”
customer that you’re also available online, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.

Shopping bags: Have you ever noticed the free advertising companies are
getting just by putting their name on a plastic bag? It’s most obvious at trade
shows and conventions, where companies give away bags so people will
carry around their logo and trademark to thousands of impressionable cus-
tomers. Take advantage of this mechanism by branding your shopping bags
with your Web store URL. You never know who’ll see it and check it out.

Shipping/packing boxes: Your Web store will typically involve sending out
products in boxes to your customers. Use that (usually empty) space to
brand your business and put your Web store URL (and logo, if you have
one) on the boxes. Not only does it signify to your customers that their
order has arrived, but everyone else, from the neighbors to the postman,
see that box as well. The best example is Amazon.com, which brands all
their boxes, mailers, and envelopes.

Company delivery trucks or cars: You’ll be surprised by how much people
pay attention to advertising on the road. I had a client who operated eBay
drop off stores, so the company vans had the Web site URL and phone
number. We had people drive up next to us, even bus drivers, and ask us
about our business while we were both stopped at a traffic light. It’s free
advertising (besides the cost of painting the vehicle, that is) that can
become your free, mobile billboard.

Packing slips/receipts: If you run a retail store, update your cash register or
POS system to add a small mention about your Web store at the bottom of
the receipt. Some companies go further and print a special discount code
on the bottom of their receipts. Don’t forget to add your URL to your Web
store packing slips too. As obvious as it sounds, even though a customer
knew your URL to place an order, putting your Web address on the packing
slip simply reinforces the message.

Display, magazine, and classified ads: If you are already paying to adver-
tise your business in a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal, it should be
very simple to add a URL to mention your Web store. Similar to the sales
flyers, in this case you may consider adding a subdomain or subdirectory
so you can track the effectiveness of this ad.
If you are paying by the word, simply end the ad with www.yourname.com
and pay for 1 additional word.

Yellow Pages and newspaper ads: Even though the point of a Yellow Pages
(or local newspaper) ad is to inform local customers about your retail loca-
tion, it never hurts to include a Web store URL so people can go there at
their own schedule to get more information about your business. Like a dis-
play ad, you’re paying to promote your business, and your URL is another
way to promote your business.

248
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 

Invoices: When doing business with other companies, it never hurts to
include your Web store URL to remind the other party of what you offer.
Sometimes, the value of including your URL comes when the receiving party
researches the invoice and learns more about your business. 

Stationery: While many small companies don’t invest in their own company
letterhead, it’s an easy mention to identify your online component with a
Web store URL. It can go at the top of the page below the company logo or
slogan, or along the bottom of the page in the footer.

Fax cover sheets: While many companies don’t use letterhead, most of
them still require the good old fax machine to do business, which means
your cover sheet is simply another branding mechanism when communicat-
ing with other companies.

Address labels: Your Web store should have detailed contact infor-
mation about your business, so including the URL on an address label is
simply another way of identifying your business for anyone who sees that
letter. It’s another reinforcement of your Web site name, which should
eventually lead to name recognition.

Business checks: Like your invoices, your business checks speak about
the image of your business, and including the URL in your business checks
reminds your partners and vendors that you participate online.

Coupons: If you are using print or e-mail coupons to encourage traffic to
your business, don’t forget to include your Web store URL in the coupon
somewhere. The only exception to this is that, if the coupon is only valid
at a retail location and not on your online store, putting the URL is wrong
because it could confuse the buyer.

Gift certificates: If you are giving someone currency to spend with you, they
should have as many options to spend it as possible, which means includ-
ing your Web store URL somewhere on the certificate. Once again, if it is a
retail-only certificate and has to be kept separate or away from your online
operations, then exclude the URL to avoid confusion.

Voicemail/answering machine: Advertising your URL isn’t limited to things
you can see. As part of your company greeting, you should include, “To find
more information, check out our Web site at www.yourname.com.” If noth-
ing else, it gives an after-hours caller something to check out if they have a
question or concern.

TV, radio, and billboards: Your Web store is part of your overall business,
so whether you are taking out TV, radio, or outdoor billboard advertise-
ments for your retail location, including your Web store URL is a small way
to make a big impact on your online sales.
Updating Your Online Presence 
with Your Web Store
We’ve talked about updating your “offline” presence with your Web store URL, which
is everything that isn’t related to your (or your customer’s) activities on the com-
puter. Before you launch your Web store, however, you should also integrate this
new information with your “online” presence.

249
Chapter 13: Putting Your Web Store at the Hub of Your Sales
This means that all your online activities, from e-mail to discussion forums, should
include a mention of your Web store. Therefore, let’s detail the major steps you
should take for these mediums:

E-mail: Advertising your Web store through e-mail is best accomplished by
creating something called an e-mail signature file, which will sit at the
bottom of every e-mail (or whichever e-mails you select) that you send out.
This e-mail signature typically contains your name, preferred e-mail
address, a Web site URL, and perhaps a quotation or slogan that you like.
Some people add logos, graphics, and even a scanned representation of
their physical signature.

Discussion forums: Every time you contribute to an online discussion
forum or message board, you’re typically allowed to have your own signa-
ture block after your message. Similar to an e-mail signature, this forum sig-
nature block usually contains your name, e-mail address, Web site URL, and
any additional information about yourself.

Networking Web sites: From social networking sites like MySpace and
Facebook, to business networking sites like LinkedIn, there are new Web
pages being created that talk about ourselves. Each of these sites allow you
to build something called a profile page, and on that page you’re allowed
(and encouraged) to mention and link to Web sites that you use and like,
and in some cases, asked to input your profession. Don’t forget to log into
each site where you have a profile and add a line that you are the “Owner of
www.yourstorename.com” or something to that effect.
We’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 16, but if you sell on other Web
sites such as eBay or Amazon, don’t forget to update your profile page on
those sites with your Web store URL as well.

Creating a Microsoft Outlook Signature File
It’s very easy to create your own e-mail signature file. This section looks at
adding a signature file to an e-mail program that sits on your computer,
specifically Microsoft Outlook. When you create a signature file in Microsoft
Outlook, that program will automatically append every e-mail you send out
with your signature information, reminding everyone you contact about
your new web store.

Create a name for your e-mail signature file. If
you’re going to create multiple e-mail signa-
tures, be sure to use a name that reflects the
situation where you want to use that signature.
For example, you could create a “Work” signa-
ture and a “Personal” signature and only
include your Web store URL in your Work sig-
nature. Once you assign a name for your e-mail
signature file, you can retrieve a previously

I
n the retail world, a soft launch is when you start conducting
business before your Grand Opening to test all your processes
and systems to make sure that you can handle the business once
you officially open your store. This practice exists in the virtual
world as well, and is highly recommended for those of you open-
ing your first Web store. It’s very easy to build the different pieces
of a Web store and assume that, since all the individual Web pages
and store elements are functional, everything will work well as one
integrated Web store. The reality is quite different, unfortunately,
as some sites open for business with lots of inconsistencies, some
of which dramatically affect sales.
In this chapter, we discuss some of the basic actions you should
take to perform a soft launch for your Web store. Remember, this
step is meant to be one of the last activities you take before your
official Grand Opening, so don’t worry about this step if you’re still
filling your product catalog, for example. We look into checking over every page of
your Web store, going through the steps to order a product, and creating a special
group of people to preview and test your Web store for you.
Visiting Every Page of Your Web Store
When you’re ready to open your virtual doors for business, your first action before
hanging any “Open” signs should be to go through and visually inspect every single
Web page within your store. Think of it as walking down every virtual aisle, making
sure the presentation and appearance are the same regardless of where you are in
the store. After all, you don’t want your customers to feel like they’re in a rag-tag
collection of differently-colored market stalls, do you? You want your customers to
know where they are doing business, from the first visit to the final checkout page.
The easiest way to do this step is with something called a site map, which contains a
listing of all the Web pages within your store. Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, for exam-
ple, creates a site map automatically for you, so you can pull it up on your screen
and start clicking links, one by one, to inspect the various Web pages.

Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
When you’re done going through the site map, and you know there is one (or more)
Web pages on your store that you didn’t visit, don’t forget to add those pages to
your site map before you finish.
If you don’t have a site map, then perhaps this alternative is for you. Bring up the
home page for your Web store and print out a copy. Then, one by one, click on all
the links available from your home page. Any time you click on a link and get
brought to another Web page with lots of different or new links, print out that page
and do the same actions with that Web page. Eventually, you should’ve clicked
through all the different Web pages you have on your store. 
If you’ve clicked through all the links and you know you haven’t reached every page
on your Web store, you need to go back and find the appropriate page and add a link
to it. Your goal is that every page on your Web store (unless it’s a private or mem-
bers only page) is accessible through a link that starts on your home page.
How do I know I’m ready for this step?
Once you know how you are going to perform your page-by-page search, you should
know when and how to perform this exercise. Therefore, ask yourself these ques-
tions before inspecting your Web store:

Am I satisfied with my Web page design and layout? If you’re still planning
on tweaking or fixing your Web site design, page design, or catalog layout,
it doesn’t make sense to inspect your Web site now because any changes
you make to your design could affect a part or the whole Web site. You may
make changes that fix bugs or problems after this process, but don’t inspect
your site thoroughly until you know the Web site design for your store is the
one you want to launch.
You can always make design changes after your site has been in business, but
you shouldn’t plan on making design changes before, during, or immediately
after your Web store launch unless you feel the current design is drastically
affecting sales in a negative way.

Have I allowed enough time to do a thorough inspection of my Web
store? Some people are so busy getting their store ready and putting a pro-
motional campaign into place that they run out of time and forget to budget
any time for a soft launch. While you can rush this process and quickly
inspect each page looking only for the most severe problems, you risk let-
ting small- and medium-sized problems reach the end customer, who could
see these inconsistencies negatively and never return to your store. Make
the time to do an accurate review job, so you convey the right level of 
professionalism. 

Are all my files available on the server yet? While you could test your Web
store with a subset of items, you want your soft launch to be as close to
your actual opening as possible so you can spot any potential problems
early. Therefore, you want to make sure that all of your templates, files,
databases, and images are uploaded to your storefront provider and are
available on the Internet.

257
Chapter 14: Hard Facts About Your Store’s “Soft Launch”
If you are worried that customers and search engines will find your soft
launch Web site ahead of the grand opening and start using it when you’re
not open yet, consider creating a “development” server or section of your
Web store that requires a user ID and password to enter. Talk to your store-
front provider about whether you can create a “development” or “test” envi-
ronment for your store.
What to inspect on each Web page
As you make your journey, page by page, here is a list of things you should look for
on each page and check off every time the answer is good: 

Is the navigation bar in the same place on every page? 

Is the company logo in the same place on every page? 

Do any of the links I click on this page go to a Web page that doesn’t exist
(known as an HTTP 404 error)?

Do I get any sort of error when I click a link?

Does every Web page have the same (or consistent) background color and
design? 

Do all the images and graphics load properly on the screen? 

Are there any misspelled words or grammatical errors on the page?

Is the correct pricing information being shown on each page? 

Is any information being “cut off” or obscured on the page? 

Does each page have the correct and corresponding page title? 

Is there any “dummy” or place-holder text that needs to be updated or
removed? 

Does every button or function work on the page? In other words, can I add a
product, complete a guestbook entry, or fill out a form?

Does the “lock” appear at the bottom right of my Web browser when I visit a
secure Web page using SSL technology? 

Does every drop-down list have all the correct options presented? 

Does every product in my catalog have at least one image or picture associ-
ated with it?

Are the ALT and META tags completed for each Web page? (View the Source
of the Web page to check for this.)

Are my contact information and shopping cart links visible from every page? 
You should place a simple copyright notice at the bottom of every Web page on your
store, to protect your design. Simply write (C), the current year, and the name of
your company, on a single line at the bottom of every Web page, like this:

Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
Inviting a Select Group to Shop 
Before the Grand Opening
Okay, you’ve gone through your Web site, you’ve placed an order, and hopefully you
feel ready to release your Web store to the masses. One good way to test out the
system during your soft launch is to invite a small group of people to go into your
store and check it out first. Not only does it make sure the system can handle multiple
orders in a short amount of time, but you’re getting test users that haven’t lived and
breathed this Web store and have zero preconceptions beyond a normal customer.
In some ways, you can spin this as a positive to your select group. Perhaps you’ve
already been doing business in some form. This is a way to “reward” your loyal cus-
tomers or a way to make past customers feel more special by giving them premier
access to your Web store ahead of anyone else. Not only are you testing your Web
store, you could get extra sales and customers out of it!
As far as the logistics, if you’re worried about the general public and/or the search
engines finding this “live” store, you can either set up a required user ID and pass-
word to block uninvited guests from getting to your store, or sometimes, simply cre-
ating an alternate URL and separate subdirectory that isn’t linked to anywhere on
your store is enough to keep people out. If no one knows where the door is located,
how can they enter?
As far as who and how to do it, here are some thoughts to consider: 

Friends and family: If you can’t ask your friends and family a favor, who can
you ask, right? This is the easiest group to ask in terms of getting participa-
tion without an overt reward or hurting your brand. If you go this route, the
main thing to consider is that you should make this as easy as possible for
them. Specifically, you do this by:
• Providing detailed instructions or guidelines in your request.
• Providing a sample credit card number and/or profile information so they
don’t have to give up their information.
• Requesting feedback on the experience, perhaps with a follow-up e-mail
questionnaire that they can respond to, or print out, check off, and mail
back to you.
• Following up on the feedback request by offering to “interview” them so
they have zero writing to do.

Past customers: Inviting past customers (eBay auction winners, previous
retail customers, and so on) to check out your new store can be a great way
to build your first group of loyal customers. You benefit by already having a
relationship with these people, so hopefully they’d be eager to shop from you
again. There is some level of trust so it’s not a blind or out-of-left-field request
for them. But this does require some guidance on your part for success.
Specifically, you might: 
• Offer some sort of reward or incentive for them to check out your site
early (a discount, free shipping, or bonus gift).

259
Chapter 14: Hard Facts About Your Store’s “Soft Launch”
• Tie the reward or incentive into a required feedback form of their experi-
ence (without the feedback, testing it early is just shopping) that asks for
positives, negatives, and problems.
• Ask for testimonials or promise to highlight your new customers in an
upcoming newsletter (people love to see their name in lights, real or vir-
tual) if they participate.
• Don’t promise any drastic changes or updates based on their feedback,
unless it’s a serious problem that will affect sales (don’t change your
business on the whims and likes of one or two customers) or a problem
that you hear from virtually everyone.

Business colleagues/potential customers: While you may not have done
business online before, or have a past set of customers, hopefully you have
some contacts from doing business and you have their e-mail addresses.
Perhaps you know of potential customers from your professional career,
non-profit activities, or extracurricular activities or hobbies. You can solicit
some help and give out some benefits as well. Here, you should consider
doing the following:
• Spend more time explaining your new Web store and this pregrand-
opening opportunity to this crowd.
• Definitely consider offering some sort of reward or compensation for
being able to act first, but make sure they have to provide some feedback
to get that reward.
• Thank them early and often for their time and commitment.
• Provide a direct line of communication for them to contact you immedi-
ately for any concerns.

Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
Inspecting Your Store for Multiple 
Web Browsers
When you develop your Web store, odds are you’re viewing your Web store
with the same Web browser and operating system for your computer
throughout the process. This means that you know exactly how your Web
store will be portrayed . . . for anyone using your particular operating
system and Web browser version. But what about other users? You don’t
want to isolate a large percentage of your potential customer base because
they use a different Web browser that may not display your Web store cor-
rectly or properly.
Therefore, you want to test your Web store to see how it will be displayed
on different Web browsers that use different operating systems from your
development computer. Thankfully, there are companies that will go out
(using different setups) and analyze your Web site with different operating
system and Web browser combinations. As of this writing, one such site,
BrowserCam (www.browsercam.com), currently has a free trial option on
their Web site.

Go to your e-mail program (the one you listed when signing up for the
free trial) and look for an e-mail from BrowserCam. BrowserCam sends
the e-mail to verify that the address you provided to them is legitimate
and that you own the account. If the e-mail doesn’t arrive in 3–5 minutes,
check any Bulk or Junk Mail folders, and if necessary re-register for the
trial. When the confirmation e-mail arrives, click the activation link or
cut and paste it into a Web browser.

Go to BrowserCam’s home page at www.
browsercam.com. On the BrowserCam home
page, take a look at the Free Evaluation window
along the right side of the page, and complete the
fields to begin to sign up for their free trial.
Don’t click the activation link until you’re ready to do your work.Your trial account is only valid for 24 hours
from the time you activate your account.

4.
Start a new Web session and go back to
BrowserCam to log onto their site. When you
log onto their site using the Members section of
their home page, you will be taken to your Plan
Summary page. This page reviews your current
account status with BrowserCam and gives you
the details on how much time and how many
browser shots (a picture of your Web store in a
particular version of a Web browser and operat-
ing system; for example Windows XP, Internet
Explorer 7.0) you have left in your account.
Typcially, your trial account will let you take up
to 200 shots of a window in a specific browser
combination that you designate.
5.
Click on the CAPTURE link to set up your Web site
test shots. When you click this link the Screen
Capture Service window will open. First, you have
to give a name to your new Project or test sce-
nario. You can also decide if you want other
BrowserCam users to be able to view these shots,
and if you want these screen shots publicly avail-
able over the Internet. Once you have set up your
project name, you have two options. For the first
option, you can enter your URL Web address(es)
manually in the boxes provided. You can click the
bulk URL link to provide a list of individual Web
pages, or click the Enter More URLs link to add up
to 10 individual Web pages. Click the Continue
button when you’re ready to proceed.
3.
Once you click or use the activation link,
you should see a confirmation screen on
BrowserCam’s site that your account has
been created. Even though your account
has been created, BrowserCam wants you to
load a current version of their Web site by
closing down your active Web browser ses-
sions and starting a brand new session.

262
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
7.
You’re now taken to the Browser Filters
window. You can see there are a lot of options
to choose from, as BrowserCam can test for all
the major and mid-level versions of Internet
Web browsers and the Windows, Mac, and
Linux operating systems. Pick the browser/OS
combinations you want to test. One option you
have in narrowing your choices is to take
advantage of the filter questions on top of the
page, selecting based on release date, popular-
ity, and popularity for the platform. For exam-
ple, if you went to Overall Browser Popularity
and picked 5 percent or greater, you’ll notice
there are fewer options in the list than there
were in the default window. You could display
browsers with 10 percent or greater popularity
and get a more refined list.
6.
For your second option, you can select the Crawl
a Web Site for Multiple URLs option. There, you
can designate whether the program should crawl
through the entire Web site or only through a set
number of sublevels. Additionally, you can have
the program take screen shots of links that go
outside your Web site, or stay within your own
domain name. Click the Continue button when
you’re ready to proceed.
When picking either of the options in Steps 5 and 6, you should specify a user ID and password if you want
BrowserCam to take a picture of a password-protected site. (If the site requires no userid/password, leave these
fields blank.) Click the Continue button when you are ready to proceed.
When choosing your browser filters, your goal is to try and test your Web site against the main options that your
customers may be using to shop your site.Your trial account has 200 views, and you can subscribe to get as
many as necessary, which could be worth the investment.You should definitely test for Internet Explorer and
Firefox for the most popular versions of Windows, and you should include some testing for the Macintosh OS
systems with Firefox and Netscape, meaning if you stick to the trial account, allocate at least 5-10 percent of
your views for testing the Macintosh OS X operating system with Firefox and Netscape.

Chapter 14: Hard Facts About Your Store’s “Soft Launch”
10. You will now see a summary screen for the test
captures. Each screen shot is associated with
the level of Web browser and operating system
running on the computer that took that screen
shot. Go through all your various test scenarios
and make sure that your store loads correctly in
all of them. If you see a flaw, make a note of the
browser level and operating system and let
your Web site designer or storefront provider
know, since they may be using incompatible
HTML commands to build your pages. 
9.
You’ve completed your order for your screen
shot test. Depending on the size of your screen
test request, you should wait a few minutes (or
longer) before clicking the link to view your
screen captures. If you chose e-mail notification
in the previous step, you should wait until you
get your e-mail before going back to view your
screen test shots. 
8.
Once you have selected your browser and operating system combinations, scroll down to review
your final options for this test. Before you start your test, you need to configure your test shots so
BrowserCam knows what to do and how to deliver the results to you. Your options are Browser Size
(unless you have specifically geared your website for a specific resolution, you should leave this box
alone), Capture Area (unless you are testing to see if pop-up windows are being created successfully,
stick to the Browser Only option), Format (it is recommended to leave this on the default setting,
JPG, as most programs can display this file the easiest), Delay (this option is recommended if you
have some sort of Flash or other animation, or some event that will be over in a matter of seconds,
and you want to see the webpage after that initial event), Page Down (if you need BrowserCam to
scroll down the Web page before taking the test shot, you can designate in the box provided how
many times the program should Page Down before stopping to take the screen shot), Save Page
Source(if you want to see the resulting HTML page source of your file as well as the screen shot),
and E-mail Notification (if you want BrowserCam to send you an e-mail notifying you when all the test
shots have been created). Click the Continue button when you’re ready to proceed.

Once you’re on the category page, click on any
of the products on that page to bring up the
product detail page. At this point, you should
see the Item photo, price, and Product
Description. Here, click the Add to Cart button
to add this product to your shopping cart.

Use your Web browser to go to the home page
of your Web store. Read the home page like you
have never seen this before, and try to browse
through the catalog. Click on the first or middle
category from your navigation bar to see the
category page of products.
Testing Your Check Out Process
Once you know everything looks fine, it’s time to test the cash register.
After all, the coolest looking e-commerce store means nothing if your cus-
tomers cannot process their orders, right? Therefore, the next step after
testing the design of your Web site is to test the main functionality by plac-
ing a sample order on your Web store.
The first thing you should check is to see if your shopping cart software has
an option to place a sample order. If you read Chapter 4, Yahoo! Stores, you
saw that they actually require you to place a sample order before they will
publish your Web store. If this function is available, it’s useful to use that
feature so it doesn’t affect your accounting or inventory management after
the sample order is placed.
When you do place your order, it is recommended to pick a non-credit card
option, so your card isn’t charged, or, to be thorough, pick one of your
credit cards to use, and then you can arrange for a refund after the sample
order is placed. In this task, we’re going to test the checkout process using
a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Web store.

On the billing page, you’re asked whether your
billing address is the same as your shipping

card information or link to your PayPal account
to pay for this order. Make sure to enter a valid

Now, you should be on your shopping cart page.
If you want to test other products, then click on
the link Keep Shopping near the bottom-left of
the order page, and repeat Steps 1 and 2 to add
more products to your shopping cart. However,
one product is sufficient to test the check out
process. When you’re ready, click the blue

Click the View button to see your order. From
the order page, click the radio button marked
Cancelled on the right side of the page, and
click Update to cancel this order from your

7.
To be thorough, you should probably go into
your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions and delete this
order, so you or one of your employees doesn’t
accidentally try to fulfill this order. Log into
your Merchant Solutions account, and from the
Merchant Starter page, click on Orders from the
Process header. You should see “1 New Order”

Now it’s time to edit your message. Yahoo! gives you a template that you can
follow, or you can delete everything and write your own message. The point of
this e-mail is to introduce your Web store, so talk about the goals or mission
of your store, what products or information you plan to carry, and why cus-
tomers should click through and see what you have to offer.

Y
ou’ve reached the final step. You’ve designed, created,
uploaded, and tested your Web store. Your catalog is ready,
your categories are created, and all your photos and descriptions
are sitting and waiting to be displayed. You’ve gone through and
verified all your Web pages are correct and look sharp. You’ve
reached that magic moment, the readiness to go “live” and open
your Web store to the public.
In this chapter, we cover the final steps you should take before and
during your Web store launch. In many situations, as the time
passes from initial store design to store launch, things change in
your Web store that aren’t reflected in the Web pages (like the
accurateness of a description or the exact inventory level of a prod-
uct). Therefore, we go over your catalog and inventory levels, as
well as your product descriptions, and look now for accurateness,
not spelling or grammar. Finally, we go over some common things
to check for as you launch your store.
Verifying Your Catalog Is Uploaded
and Accurate
As you’ve developed your Web store, odds are the more time between your initial
gathering of data and the time to launch, the more of a chance that the catalog needs
to be updated. While you were busy coming up with your store design, uploading all
the information, and building all the functionality of your Web store, product
descriptions may have changed, inventory levels may have fluctuated, and pricing
information may be different.

Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
Therefore, I recommend performing the following checks before your Web store goes live: 

Check to make sure that all your pictures were uploaded correctly and
associated with a product. If you did something called a bulk upload, where
you sent a lot of information, all at once, to your storefront provider, there is a
small chance that perhaps one or more of your picture files may have gotten
scrambled or uploaded incorrectly and is not visible on your Web store. Log
onto your storefront provider and check your directories where your images
are located. If you’ve got lots of pictures, do a random check (perhaps every
fifth or sixth picture) by clicking on it and make sure it loads properly into a
Web browser window. If you see any graphics representing a broken image,
as shown in Figure 15-1, go back and upload that picture again.
Additionally, even if the image was uploaded correctly, sometimes it won’t
get assigned to the right product, or any product for that matter. If you have
a product that doesn’t have an image associated with it, your system may
show “No Image Available,” as shown in Figure 15-2. Check to make sure the
image association is correct, as one misspelled letter or extra keystroke
could have thrown off the system.
If you’re going to re-use pictures for more than one product listing, make
sure you display the picture at the same size for each listing. Otherwise, if
you try to enlarge a small graphic (see Figure 15-3), you get a blurry and
unattractive picture that could dissuade some buyers.
Figure 15-1: A broken picture typically shows up as an X in a box.
Figure 15-2: Make sure there is a picture associated with every product.

271
Chapter 15: Load, Look, and Launch — Final Steps Before You Open
Figure 15-3: Keep instances of the same picture the same size throughout the catalog, or risk having a
blurry enlarged image.

Check your pricing information against competitors on the Internet.
Sometimes, a month (or even a day) is all it takes for a product to ignite (or
fizzle) on the Internet. If you’re selling sports memorabilia, for example, you
might want to check your prices again, because I can guarantee that merchan-
dise related to Barry Bonds sells for higher prices after he breaks a record,
compared with before he breaks the record. If you’re dealing with celebrity
merchandise, then current events may dictate if you have to update your
prices. Of course, any event-related merchandise is priced differently before
and after the event, and sees either a sliding scale decrease the further away
from the event, or a rising increase in price if the supply was limited and/or
popularity is high. Finally, the manufacturer may announce or roll out a price
cut, like Microsoft did in August 2007 on their X-Box 360 video game system. If
all the major retailers update their prices, and you don’t, then you become
the high-price alternative and risk losing customers.

Read through your product descriptions for accuracy, not just spelling and
grammar. In the previous chapter, we recommended you scan through your
Web site content to look for misspelled words or grammatical errors. This
time, we want you (or someone on your staff who is very familiar with the
products) to read through the product descriptions to make sure they’re
accurate. Sometimes, when you get information from the manufacturer, if
the product hasn’t been released yet then you get only a partial description.
Look for any notes of “Missing Information,” “Coming Soon,” or “TBA (To Be
Announced). Do some research with the manufacturer or on the Internet to
see if you can replace these notes with current data.

272
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
In some cases (see Figure 15-4), you may find an item where the picture,
title, and pricing information have uploaded correctly, but there’s no
description. It’s your job to ensure that every product in your catalog has
at least one paragraph of description for the item.
Figure 15-4: Make sure your catalog items aren’t missing a description.

Make sure your category structure is complete and accurate. It’s encour-
aged to do some random sampling of the products in your catalog and make
sure they’re assigned to the correct category. Otherwise, if the product isn’t
in its logical place, then customers may not find it and therefore can’t buy it.
Finally, you want to make sure that the categories created on your Web store
catalog are properly filled in or are going to have hot merchandise soon. It’s
very easy during the planning stages of a Web store to create a list of desired
categories and then find out (when the store is going to launch) that certain
categories won’t be filled with any merchandise (or only one or two second-
ary items). You don’t want a customer clicking on a category to see zero
items created for that category, as that looks like poor planning on your part.
Making Sure Your Store’s 
Information Is Correct
Once you’ve verified your catalog data to be correct, up-to-date, and complete, it’s
time to inspect the rest of your Web store. Things can definitely change between your
first initial plan for your store and the final implementation, and sometimes we’re so
happy to see the light at the end of the tunnel that we forget to go back and update
our Web pages with the final decision of how your Web store will be executed.
Therefore, it’s recommended to go back and review all the Web pages of your store.
This time, however, instead of looking for obvious spelling and grammatical mis-
takes, pay more attention to the content on the pages, and make sure that the poli-
cies, guidelines, and rules stated are the same as your goals for running the Web
store.

273
Chapter 15: Load, Look, and Launch — Final Steps Before You Open
Here are some questions to get you started:

Did I finalize my store policies, including return/refund and privacy poli-
cies? We talked about store policies way back in Chapter 2, and usually
some boiler plate documentation is thrown in and then never reviewed
again . . . until your initial customers start calling you on it once their orders
are placed and expect you to honor the policy they read on your site when
they placed an order. Therefore, go back and make sure you agree with the
policies you previously stated. Perhaps, while building your store, you
decided to focus on closeout or used merchandise and forgot to update
your refund policy to state “No returns. Items sold as-is.” The key is to make
sure you’re consistent in your policies.

What shipping methods and rates am I going to offer my customers?
Depending on the series of steps you took to build your Web store, you
may have had to build your shipping options in first, and then go back and
think about a shipping company and sign up for an account, like we did in
Chapter 12. However, you may not have reviewed your shipping terms since
that initial setup and you may be charging your customers incorrectly, and
that could mean you’re charging too little or too much.
Go back to your shipping options and make sure that your shipping totals
are being computed based on weight of the package, distance between you
and the customer, and the speed of delivery, whenever possible. You won’t
survive as an e-commerce merchant charging too little for shipping, unless
you’ve decided that shipping will be a promotional cost to encourage cus-
tomers to try you out.

Do I mention any events or dates as upcoming when they have already
passed? This is a common mistake for Web sites that have news, events, or
press release sections where they plan to promote an upcoming event as
they’re building their Web store but by the time the website is ready to
launch, the event has already occurred. When customers see this mistake,
they assume you don’t update your Web store often and will probably not
get their order in a quick or expedient manner either. 

Is my contact information current and up-to-date? As people build their Web
stores and set up their infrastructure, sometimes they experience change
before the Web store has been launched. Perhaps you realize early that you
have to set up in a warehouse to handle your new operations, or you have
decided to relocate to a place with favorable tax benefits. Whatever the
reason, before you go live make sure that the Contact Information page on
your Web store is up-to-date with the correct e-mail address, postal address,
and telephone number that you want your customers or visitors to use when
contacting you. Let’s say that when you set up your Web store you initially
put one of your personal e-mail addresses, but since then you’ve established
a stand-alone customer service e-mail address. Don’t forget to go back and
put that address in the right places on your Web store. (By the way, a cus-
tomer service e-mail address is highly recommended.)

Have I left any of my store pages completely blank? This may sound like a
strange question, especially if you’ve been clicking through and reviewing all
your Web pages. But sometimes, the pages we think about the least (like the
About Us or Company History pages), get put off. The thinking is usually “Oh,
we will get to that later,” and then the Web site gets launched and you end
up with an About Us page like the one in Figure 15-5. Make sure that every
page without product has some content as well, and either fill the page with

274
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
some content, or, if you don’t have time and it doesn’t affect the navigation
bar, remove the page until you have the time to create something worthwhile.
Figure 15-5: Don’t leave any Web page on your site without content.
Other times, perhaps you created a “place-holder” for a store page, with the
hopes and intentions of filling it in later, like putting TBA in a product
description (see previous section). The last thing you want your customers
to see, besides an empty page, is a page with a placeholder like “Coming
Soon” or “FAQ goes here” (see Figure 15-6), so fill that page or remove it
from sight until you can properly fill it.
Figure 15-6: Placeholders should be removed and replaced, or hidden from view.

275
Chapter 15: Load, Look, and Launch — Final Steps Before You Open
The Final Checks — Countdown to Launch
Once you’re finished with adding your products to your catalog and creating all the
various Web pages that will make up your Web store, and you feel that you’re ready
to open the doors and start generating traffic, I recommend doing a “final sweep” of
your new Web store and getting everything ready for your launch. Once you have
orders to fill, and customers and visitors asking questions, you probably won’t have
the time to go back and do these checks, so do it before the traffic begins.

Check your load times: The load time is known as the amount of time it takes
for a Web page to fully display on someone’s computer screen. Depending on
how much information and graphics are on the page and how the user is con-
necting to the Internet, the load time can be less than a second or several min-
utes. If your Web site is loading slowly on other people’s computers, you need
to figure out a way to decrease that time, as customers will not be patient
enough to wait for the page to load — they’ll simply go to a competitor’s Web
store. Some things you can do if your Web store load times are high are:
• Reduce the amount of graphics on your page.
• Reduce or eliminate unnecessary functions like animated Flash
presentations.
• Reduce the size or optimize the graphics you are using on your page.
• Try to re-use the same graphics on different pages so the computer can
use a locally-stored copy when your customer goes page to page on your
site, thus saving time re-loading graphics.

Get your final pieces from your developer: If you’re going to use any out-
side contractors to help you finish your Web store, it’s advisable to meet
with them to receive your final deliverables (goods) and sign an agreement
that you approve of the quality of work and accept it. This way, you’re not
launching your Web store and then having to go back and integrate a piece
you just received, as that integration could cause problems down the road if
not fully tested. When you launch your Web store, it should be with all the
elements you planned (and paid) to execute.

Make a full backup copy of your website: Some store-front providers do
automatic backups of your system. If they don’t provide this function, it’s
useful to prepare a file that has all the Web pages, images, and catalog infor-
mation, and store it somewhere safe in case anything happens to your Web
site. It’s also useful to have a “snapshot” of your original site when it’s time
to plan for the next version, for example. 

Check your custom programming: If you’re using advanced scripts or pro-
gramming languages in your Web store, sometimes you can’t fully test these
scripts until the Web store is live and ready to go. Once you upload the
code to your Web store, you should immediately start checking any
advanced functionality to make sure it’s working as designed.

Test your search engine criteria: If you have a search engine for your Web
site, go ahead and type in some sample searches as though you were a cus-
tomer. If you have an advanced search engine (as shown in Figure 15-7), test
the different criteria. For example, if you offer your customers a chance to
search between a minimum and maximum value, try entering $1 for your
minimum and $50 for your maximum and make sure the results contain only
items in that range.

276
Part IV: Finalizing Your Web Store 
Figure 15-7: Test the different elements of your store search engine.

Transfer your files to the server: With some e-commerce software pack-
ages you have to manually “turn on” your Web store by telling the software
to transfer the Web pages you have created to the “live” or “real” server, so
the public can access it over the Internet. In those cases, you prepare your
Web pages on a “development” portion (that is only accessible to you and
your provider) of their Web server so you won’t have to worry about
anyone accidentally coming across your Web store and placing an order too
soon. Depending on your storefront provider, you may see one of the follow-
ing phrases as the link to click when you want to “turn on” your Web store: 
• Upload your Web site
• Publish your Web site
• Open my store
• Send to live server
You’ve reached a very important milestone — the official launch of your Web store!
It’s a time to celebrate, but also a time to shift gears. Think of this launch not as an
end, but as a new beginning, because a Web store (like any Web site) requires con-
stant tending and maintenance to stay viable. Look forward to your future and keep
an eye on your store. The fun and profit has only begun.

277
Chapter 15: Load, Look, and Launch — Final Steps Before You Open
Testing Your Load Times
It’s important to view your Web store on a computer connected live to
the Internet, not to look for technical or functional accuracy, but simply
to study how long it takes each page to load on your computer. This will
be an estimate for what your customers may experience when they use
your Web store. If you’re planning to open a large, enterprise-scale store,
you may want to do an Internet search for Web site load testing and use
a software program to test your load times. For most Web stores, you
can measure your load times manually, which we do in this exercise.
1.
Using your Web browser, type in the URL for your web store. You
can either use a stopwatch or just monitor the page as it loads on
the screen. If you use a stopwatch, once you type in the URL and
hit the Enter button, start your stopwatch and don’t stop it until
your Web store home page fully loads. If it takes more than 5–10
seconds for your home page to load, you should consider reducing
the number of images or data on the home page.

2.
Click the Site Map button to view a full list of all
the Web pages in your store. (Depending on the
template you picked, the Site Map link could be
along the top, left, or bottom of your page.) 
3.
Click the first item on the list, and study how long it takes for that page to
load. Then, click the Back button on your Web browser to go back to the
Site Map page and click the next page on the list. Repeat this process
until you have clicked on every page in your Web store.
4.
In many cases, your page will load so quickly that you won’t get an accu-
rate stopwatch reading, which is great. Once you’ve clicked through your
entire Web site, if you notice one or two pages that seem to load slower
than the others, go back to those pages and consider ways to reduce the
load time, like eliminating large image files.

Yahoo! Merchant Solutions does an automatic backup of your entire Web

automatically activated when you start designing your Web store. The func-
tion takes a copy, or snapshot, of your Web site every four hours, nightly,
and weekly, by recording changes to your files. These snapshots are saved
and dated and made available to you. However, you can go one step further
by making a backup copy of your product catalog, so you can upload it at a
future date in case of an emergency.

Once this file is saved to your computer, you
may consider saving that file on another device,
like an external hard drive or a tape drive, in
case your computer’s hard drive experiences a
problem.

Part V
Promotion and Outsourcing
of Your Web Store

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the essential steps that a Web store
owner should take after the store has been built and
launched on the Internet. First, and foremost, you need to
think about bringing as much traffic to your Web store as
possible. I start by discussing different mechanisms for
generating buzz about your Web store online, from blogs
to newsletters to using sites like eBay to announce your
new Web store.
Then, I move into more traditional advertising mecha-
nisms for your Web store, like pay per click advertising
and submitting your store to the search engines.
Finally, I talk about how you may want to take your Web
store to the next level, by outsourcing pieces of your busi-
ness like shipping and fulfillment or store redesign, or
how to use Internet sites like Prosper to get additional
funding to grow your Web store.

Y
ou’ve built your Web store, but will they come? That is the
dilemma every Web store owner faces — the hope that
their efforts will be rewarded with a steady stream of customers, a
healthy profit margin, and a growing business to sustain. Building
the Web store is very important, which is why we dedicated so
many pages to talk about all the various steps and functionality.
But your work is not over yet. It’s time to tell the masses, get them
fired up, and drive that traffic to your Web store.
In this chapter, we talk about many different ways you can use the
Internet to get the word out about your store. One of the newer
technologies, the Web log, or blog, has grown in popularity the last
few years and is now a great way to build a dialogue and relation-
ship with your customers while promoting your store and the vari-
ous pages within your store. We show you two sites in specific that
offer free blogs you can create. From there, we talk about the next
great way to build that ongoing relationship — the newsletter (or 
e-newsletter, for Web stores) you should send out. We discuss the
important elements of a newsletter and tips to consider. We finish
up by discussing how you can use other Web sites to sell merchan-
dise that will point customers to your own Web store.
Using a Blog to Promote Your Web Store
The blogging phenomenon has taken the Internet by storm, with reports of 80–100
million blogs in creation, and more being started every day. While many of the blogs
out there focus on one area of discussion, from politics to marketing to entertain-
ment, a small but growing number of blogs have been created by companies, large
and small. Companies are creating blogs to have a dialogue or give more information
to their customers about what goes on in their business, and how these events can
help or impact their customer base.
In essence, having a blog is like having a conversation with your customers if they
came through your door in a retail setting. Many store owners use their blog to dis-
cuss new inventory purchases, upcoming events and sales, and trends that they’ve
noticed that could affect their business. Some blogs allow comments, where their

customers can comment on a store owner’s postings and give their enthusiasm,
comments, or feedback. 
Blogs have other features besides the increased communication between you and
your customers:

It’s much easier to add a blog entry about an upcoming product category
change or news announcement than to constantly add notices and
reminders on your Web store pages — potentially having to redesign your
site to include this new element.

Your blog allows you to highlight individual sections of your Web store with-
out having to completely re-design your navigation bar for a temporary pro-
motion. You can feed people with targeted links to a different section every
day, week, or month.

The extra links that a blog makes to your Web site are seen as additional
references that help your search engine ranking.

Your blog gives your customers an additional media source to learn about
the products they are purchasing, and a chance to learn from other cus-
tomers via the feedback/comments section.
Since the goal of your blog is to connect with your potential customers, one strategy
for using a blog could be to go where your customers are already reading blogs. If
your Web store category falls into a big niche, like electronics or toys and games, you
could look for a blogging portal that caters to that customer set and see if you can
add a blog through their portal or site to reach the same customer set. This way, you
can take advantage of the established traffic of a popular blogging portal or be
included in a network or collective of blogs.
The other main strategy when it comes to blogs is to have the blog actually reside
on your Web site. This way, customers have to come to your Web store to read
the blog and, hopefully, get valuable information and become more “emotionally
invested” in your operation. The hope is that they’ll check out a new product, take
advantage of a sale event, or simply be encouraged to place a new order. Talk to
your storefront provider about what options currently exist to have the blog appear
on your Web store.
Some of the options below will allow you to redirect people from a subdomain on
your Web site directly to the blog page. 
There are a number of free and paid blogging solutions to choose from. The main
choices available today include:

Blogger (www.blogger.com): Created by Google, this Web site allows you to
build any number of blogs with built-in tools to make blog maintenance as
easy as possible. We discuss how to sign up with Blogger later in this chapter.

Yahoo! 360 (360.yahoo.com): As part of Yahoo’s effort to generate and
organize more content on the Web, they’ve created the “360” pages as a way
to blog and share photos, information, and more with others. You need a
Yahoo! ID to take advantage of this, which you already have if you’re using
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions. We show you how to sign up with Yahoo! 360
later in this chapter.

285
Chapter 16: Getting the Word Out — Drawing Attention to Your Store

WordPress (www.wordpress.com): This company became well known for
a powerful blogging software they developed through a concept called open
source, where anybody can download and update the software code on their
own while keeping the software free to use. They created a .com site to offer
people free blog accounts. 

TypePad (www.typepad.com): This company is probably the most famous
of the paid blogging sites, as big-name personalities like Seth Godin, Dilbert
creator Scott Adams, and Andrew Sullivan use TypePad’s powerful blogging
tool to maintain their blogs. If you want an advanced blog that sits on your
Web site and offers lots of options, TypePad has packages starting at $4.95
per month that may interest you.

MSN Spaces (spaces.live.com): Microsoft will not only offer your busi-
ness a free Web site through their Live service, but they have a Spaces fea-
ture that is, in essence, a free blogging tool that would integrate with your
Web site. The downside is that Microsoft controls the advertising to pay for
the service.

Utilizing a Newsletter for Your Store
As a business owner, one of your responsibilities is to figure out how to stay in touch
with your customers, keep them informed about your business, and encourage that
all-so-coveted repeat business without annoying, turning off, or isolating your cus-
tomer or visitor base.
One of the most popular ways for Web stores to accomplish this is to write and pub-
lish their own newsletter, which combines information and product announcements
to remind people about the business and give them useful information in exchange
for their time and attention. 
Newsletters are quickly becoming popular for many reasons (low cost, quick set up
time, improved customer loyalty, and typically a great conversion rate of visitors to
paying customers) compared with other means. It’s important to note that the
online newsletters contain at least one article of useful, practical, or interesting
information that would matter to your customers, along with a few product promo-
tions or highlights, and perhaps some business announcements or promotions, like
specialty eBay auctions or charity fundraising. As an example, let’s look at Lynn
Dralle (a.k.a. “The Queen of Auctions”) who publishes a weekly newsletter (shown
in Figure 16-1) that gives her readers valuable tips for selling online while promoting
her own books, DVDs, and coaching seminars that she sells herself.
If you send out a newsletter that has no useful information, simply product
announcements and business promotions, that’s not a newsletter — it’s a sales flyer.
People typically agree to a newsletter because it brings them some value, which is
why they choose to allow it and spend their valuable time reading it. You’ll lose cus-
tomers and business value by passing a sales flyer off as a newsletter.

286
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
Figure 16-1: Use newsletters to give information and build relationships.
Just like with blogs, newsletters take some time on your part, so think carefully
before you decide to promote this feature and collect customer names to be on your
newsletter list. This doesn’t have to be a huge time-consuming effort, but set aside
some time on a regular basis to handle the newsletter creation, or designate an
employee to handle the newsletter for you.
Putting together the parts of your newsletter
When you want to create your Web store newsletter, it’s helpful to understand the
basic anatomy of a newsletter and the elements needed to make this happen.
Therefore, let’s go through each part of your store newsletter and talk about what
to consider: 

Articles: At the heart of your newsletter should be at least one article that
contains some useful information. You have many options here, depending
on the intent you want your newsletter to convey. Some store newsletters
feature tips and tricks related to the products they sell. For example, a Web
store that sells digital cameras could fill their newsletters with digital pho-
tography tips and how their customers can maximize their investment.
Other newsletters could highlight product reviews or detailed how-to

287
Chapter 16: Getting the Word Out — Drawing Attention to Your Store
guides. You could also comment on the state of your industry and discuss
overall product trends or important news items that would interest your
customers. As far as who will write these articles for your newsletter, you
have several choices:
• You: After all, who knows product lines better than the person who sells
them, right? If you’re setting up a Web store because you’ve got experi-
ence with your products, then share that knowledge by writing short arti-
cles for your store newsletter. You can write articles that focus on “Top 10
Tips for Using Product X,” “Five things to watch out for when trying to do
Y,” or “Three Unexpected Uses for Item Z.” You can use your newsletters
to write columns about your experiences as a store owner, or the lessons
learned from retailing in your particular industry.
Publish your newsletter articles on your Web store as well. Adding content
to your Web store will improve your search engine rankings. (We discuss
this in more depth in the next chapter.)
• Your customers: By having customers relate their experiences with your
products, whether it’s a product review, interesting story, or questions
about the product that you will answer, you get not only some original
content for your newsletters, but an increased connection between you
and your customer base. Every time your newsletter comes out, your
customers will open it up looking to see if their names are in (virtual)
lights. It also gives you legitimacy in customers’ minds when they see
other customers using your business.
If you go this route, have someone look it over first to make sure the con-
tent is appropriate, as well as free of spelling and grammatical mistakes.
You may also want to build up several entries of reserve, in case cus-
tomer submission is light for a period of time.
• Other people: There are numbers of people who are looking for
increased exposure for their own efforts, whether it’s their own Web site,
consulting service, or business. These people write articles that are
freely distributed on the Internet with the goal of increasing their status
due to the required biography and Web links attached to the end of these
articles. You can go to Web sites known as article directories and find free
articles that relate to your industry that you can include in your newslet-
ter. Some places to get started can be found include Ezine @articles
(www.ezinearticles.com), GoArticles.com (www.goarticles.com),
ArticleTrader (www.articletrader.com), Articlesbase.com
(www.articlesbase.com), and ArticleCity (www.articlecity.com).

Product Offers: Once you’ve gotten your customer’s attention and provided
some good information, there’s nothing wrong with reminding them of some
of the products for sale in your Web store. You should definitely include the
title of the product and a direct link to the product detail page on your Web
store. Depending on the format of your newsletter, you can enhance your
product offer with elements like a thumbnail photo, short description, cur-
rent price, and more. If you’re wondering which products to feature in your
newsletter, here are some possibilities:
• Brand new products to your store. You can create excitement and buzz by
highlighting the newest arrivals to your store, and labeling them as Just
Arrived, Newly Available, or Brand New! This way, you’re not only promot-
ing them, but informing customers of your newest product offerings.

288
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
• Items that you are putting on sale. If you’ve decided to discount one of
your products (perhaps it’s not selling as quickly as you expected, or you
want to reduce your inventory of a given product), then help that promo-
tion by featuring that sale item in your newsletter.
• Items that are mentioned in the newsletter’s articles. For example, if
your article was a review of three different digital cameras that you carry
in your Web store, perhaps offer a newsletter-only discount if they click
the link from the newsletter and buy it.

Announcements or news updates: Since the goal of a newsletter is to stay in-
touch with your customers, it’s perfectly acceptable (and preferred, actually)
to mention any news updates regarding your Web store in the newsletter.
You can announce an upcoming sale on your store, let people know that you
plan to carry a new category in a few months, or tell people that you added a
new payment method to your store. These are best suited for the end of the
newsletter, but you can lead your newsletter with a featured news update and
then introduce your article, like the Hero Initiative, a non-profit organization
dedicated to helping comic creators in need, did in their newsletter (see
Figure 16-2).
Figure 16-2: Introduce your newsletter with a featured news item.

Deciding on the mechanics of your newsletter
Once you have your content for your newsletter, it’s time to figure out the process of
how your newsletters will be generated and sent. Therefore, here are some ques-
tions you should ask yourself to get ready for this process:

What format should I use to publish my newsletter? You have two options
here, plain text and HTML . A plain-text newsletter is just that, plain old text.
You can include Web links with your text, but no graphics, formatting, or
anything special. The advantage of plain-text is that any e-mail reader can
handle them, and they are quick to load and distribute. The disadvantage is
that it is hard to capture a reader’s attention with just text. HTML (Hypertext
Markup Language) newsletters allow you to precisely format your newslet-
ter and add graphics, color, and other HTML elements so it resembles your
Web store. While some e-mail programs can’t handle a fully formatted HTML
newsletter, many of them will display these properly.
When in doubt, make two versions of your newsletter, HTML and plain text,
and let your subscribers choose their preferred method when they sign up.

How often should I send out my newsletter? You have several options in
this case. Most people prefer either a weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly/quar-
terly schedule. The important thing to remember here is to be consistent
once you decide on a schedule. If you promise a weekly newsletter and only
deliver one every few months, your readers will lose interest and confi-
dence in your abilities as a retailer. Conversely, if you promise a monthly
schedule and rapidly fire a few newsletters into their e-mail inbox every
week, the customers will feel overwhelmed and abused. Pick a schedule
where you know you can comfortably deliver quality.

How do I get people to join my newsletter? The answer here is simple —
as many ways as you can. This is an ongoing promotion mechanism for your
e-commerce Web store, so getting people to sign up will be an ongoing effort
as well. Some techniques retailers have used include:
• Offering a discount or free shipping if a previous, current, or new cus-
tomer joins the newsletter list.
• Encouraging sign-ups from a link on the Web store home page.
• Inviting people who have purchased from them to sign up for the newsletter.
• Including a sign-up card (with enrollment instructions) in the package
when an order is shipped out.
• Partnering with similar companies (not direct competitors) and inviting
those members to join your newsletter list in exchange for a free gift or
bonus.

How do I manage my newsletter subscriptions and cancellations? This is
best handled by a newsletter service or list management service. The last
thing you want to do is manually update your newsletter list and go through
to take out a name when someone sends you an e-mail to get off your list.
Later in this chapter, we discuss some companies that will help you build
and distribute your newsletter, and those companies can help manage your
subscription information. If you plan on building and e-mailing your newslet-
ter yourself, you can use list management software from Freelists.org or start
and maintain your own Yahoo! group at http://groups.yahoo.com.

Selling on Other Sites
As we discussed in Chapter 13, your Web store needs to be the hub of your sales
activity. However, that doesn’t mean it has to be the sole location of your sales activ-
ity. Shoppers take advantage of the wide variety of retailers and sales sites to find
goods and services, and the most successful retailers will reach out to be wherever
their customers may go.
It is important, when setting up some products for sale on other sites, to remember
the reason why you are doing this. The end goal of doing business on these other
sites is not necessarily to make money while selling on these sites, but rather to pro-
mote their business and refer any customers to their own Web store. Therefore,
some Web store owners will sell promotional items, or sell regular products below
their cost, simply to attract attention, gain new customers, and point those cus-
tomers to their Web store.
In addition, every time you do business on another site, you typically have the chance
to set up your own profile page, which can include information and links to your Web
store, and this will raise your Web store profile online as well. 
Here are some Web sites to consider putting up some items:

eBay: With over 240 million registered users around the world (as of this
writing), eBay is the number one e-commerce site on the Internet. They’re
one of the top 10 most popular Internet sites in general, and the highest
ranked commerce site. More important, however, is that the average eBay
user spends almost 2 hours per visit on the site, looking for merchandise in
over 50,000 distinct categories and sub-categories.

Amazon.com: Earth’s Biggest Bookstore has branched out to include up to
41 different categories, as of this writing. They have 65 million customers in
various countries around the world, and they created the Marketplace where
anyone can get an account and sell items like books, DVDs, CDs, electronics,
and video games to Amazon buyers using the Amazon infrastructure. In addi-
tion, they have an Advantage program where publishers can list their own
books, DVDs, CDs, and other media to be sold on Amazon.

Yahoo! Shopping: Independent of Yahoo’s other offerings, like Merchant
Solutions, Yahoo! Shopping offers a directory of products available for sale
across the Internet. Retailers provide Yahoo! Shopping with a catalog or list
of products available for sale, and Yahoo! Shopping organizes this informa-
tion in a directory-style format, where browsers can look up various prod-
ucts and see which retailers are selling that item and each retailer’s price
for that item.

uBid: This site is looking to become an alternative to eBay, where small and
large sellers offer a variety of brand-name goods in a more focused and con-
trolled atmosphere that is conducive to completing the transaction. uBid
has a seller registration form that allows your business to register and take
advantage of this up and coming marketplace.
As I mentioned, eBay is the top shopping destination on the Internet as of this writ-
ing. One of the reasons that eBay became so popular is because many of the prod-
ucts sold on eBay are sold via an auction-style format. Buyers place bids on the

291
Chapter 16: Getting the Word Out — Drawing Attention to Your Store
items to compete for the right to buy that item from a seller. When the clock runs
out on an item (going once, going twice, sold!) there is known to be some frenzied
bidding activity as eBay users log in and put their final bids. This has turned shop-
ping into entertainment, as people compete instead of browse and get the sense of
victory when they “win” an item.
This excitement can translate into new customers to check out your own Web store,
if you put some auctions on eBay that relate to your Web store in some way. Simply
having an account with eBay allows you to build a profile page to advertise your
business. Previously, it was called About Me, but today it is referred to as My World,
and later in this chapter we detail how you can create this page.
The My World page is the only Web page within eBay where you are allowed to link
or mention the URL of your Web store. You can’t link from your individual auction
pages to any outside URL for commerce purposes, including your own Web store.
You have several options when it comes to picking items to sell on eBay:

Products from your Web store: Since you’re already selling products in
your Web store, you could pick one item from each category and list it for
sale on eBay at an introductory price. You can also start the bidding at the
minimum price you need to break even, or a fixed price based on your cost
or Web store price.

Promotional or one-of-a-kind items: If you have any unique offerings, or per-
haps can create an experience or something similar, then eBay is the perfect
place to let customers compete for this rare item. Some companies have auc-
tioned off everything from a dinner with the company CEO to the original
desk used by the founder. Toy companies have been known to auction off
one-of-a-kind prototypes of an action figure to coincide with the retail launch
of that action figure line in stores. Some companies have even sold the
chance to own the first of a new product. One example is Dr. Pepper, which
auctioned off unopened 12 pack soda can boxes of their new flavors like
Berries and Cream to enthusiastic buyers before those flavors were available
in retail stores. Some of those 12 packs went for as high as $60-80 each and
gave Dr. Pepper some extra publicity.

Damaged or “hurt” inventory: Perhaps there is some inventory in your
Web store that isn’t exactly new and unused that you don’t feel comfortable
selling to your regular customers alongside other new, unused products.
eBay has become an excellent place to sell your used, damaged, scuffed, or
otherwise “hurt” or non-new inventory at a separate price on a separate
channel from your retail sales. Companies such as the Sharper Image,
Kodak, and Olympus have made big bucks selling this kind of merchandise
directly to their end user customers without upsetting their retail channel
partners.

New product lines: Sometimes, if you want to judge the popularity of offer-
ing a new product line in your store, you can test it out by having an eBay
auction for the item first and seeing how popular and how many bids the
item received. Auctions allow you to gauge some customer demand to help
you set good prices for your customers, since you can see how much
people are willing to go, monetarily speaking, to get the product.

292
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 

Charity auctions: You can help your favorite non-profit organization and gain
some attention for your store at the same time. You can pick any kind of prod-
uct, experience, or service to put up for auction and have a percentage of the
proceeds donated to the charity of your choice. You can check to see if your
charity is listed with eBay Giving Works (www.givingworks.ebay.com) or
ask the charity to register with MissionFish (www.missionfish.org) first so
eBay will recognize them as a valid charity to receive auction proceeds.

on buying or selling on the auction site, I recommend either eBay For Dummies or

Collier and published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Go to ListApp’s home page at www.server.com/WebApps/ListApp.
When you go to ListApp’s home page, scroll down and you’ll notice that
they offer a simple form to get started. Simply enter your newsletter
name, e-mail address, and create a password. Then, click on the Create
Your Newsletter button to get started. It will prompt you again for the
password you just created. Enter that password and click Continue.

You’ll see the ListApp maintenance form. In
the shaded boxes, you’ll see HTML code that
you can insert into the Web pages of your
store that will allow customers to click a
button and either subscribe or unsubscribe
from your newsletter. You should also see a
Web link that you can distribute in e-mails
that will accomplish the same task. Use these
functions to start building up your mailing list.
Scroll down the page and click Create
Message to build your newsletter.

ListApp will put your newsletter in the queue
and send out the newsletter at the next sched-
uled batch. Usually, messages go out starting
at midnight EST, so once your message is
ready for sending it will sit in a queue until that
time occurs. If you need the newsletter to go
out sooner, click the “Click Here to Send Your
Message Now” button. Your newsletter will
be moved up the queue and go out almost
immediately.
4.
You will be presented with a sample of the
newsletter you wish to send out. Read through
the newsletter message you’ve just created. If
you created an HTML newsletter, don’t be afraid
to click any of the links embedded in your
newsletter to make sure they go to the correct
destination. If you need to change or update
anything, click the Edit Message button and
you’ll go back to Step 3 to update your newslet-
ter. If everything looks good, click the Send
button. If you’re happy with the newsletter but
not ready to send anything out, click the Return
to Main Form button. Once you have your
starter mailing list defined (think of the list you
used in Chapter 14 for your Grand Opening
e-mail, for example), click the Send button to
have ListApp mail out your newsletter.

When you click Create Message you’ll see the
message page. Ignore the text in the To: field,
as that is more of a placeholder than anything
else. Enter a subject line for your newsletter,

Making Your eBay Auction Stand Out
When it’s time to list something for sale on
eBay, you want to make sure that your auc-
tions stand out as much as possible.
Therefore, here’s a checklist of tips to follow
when you set up your eBay auctions: 
 Research the product using eBay’s
search engine before you start listing it.
So many people just dive into creating
an eBay listing without checking to see
how similar items have performed on
eBay in the past. That’s like buying a
share of IBM stock without knowing its
closing price, 52 week range, or other
key financials. The beautiful thing about
eBay is that you can perform a free
search of eBay’s records for the past 15
days to see how the item has previously
sold. When you search for completed
listings, you can learn many things to
help you sell your product.
 Leverage your product catalog by re-
using pictures and descriptions when-
ever possible. If you’re selling products
from your catalog, don’t reinvent the
wheel. Simply copy and paste your
product photos, description, title, and
any other information into your eBay
listing. This way, you can put an item up
for sale and retain the same information
that customers would see on your Web
store. Try to add a watermark to your pic-
tures that has your Web store name in it.
Not only does this prevent your competi-
tors from re-using your pictures, but it
lets customers see the name of your
business!
 Make sure that your product descriptions
are both comprehensive and organized.
When someone takes a look at your eBay
auction page, your goal is to have enough
information in that auction description
that the buyer has zero questions and is
ready to place a bid. Therefore, you need
to create a structured approach to your
description, using white space and for-
matting to lay out the information in a
way that doesn’t overwhelm the reader.
Additionally, there needs to be enough
information to answer any potential
customer’s concerns without becoming
tedious or overbearing. When they come
to your Web store, the average customer
is more focused and knows what they
want. On eBay, they love to click around
and browse, so you have to do more to
hook them and convince them to buy.
 Include your Web store “look and feel”
into your auction descriptions as much
as possible. When a customer goes to
your auction description, it should feel
like they’re on a part of your Web site.
That means you should try to include
your store logo, colors and buttons as
part of the auction description section.
Simply copy and paste the HTML code
from one of your Web store pages and
put the essential elements in your eBay
auction description section. Remember:
don’t put any direct links to your Web
store from your eBay auctions.
 Introduce every one of your eBay winners
to your Web store after they win an auc-
tion. Once you have a successful auction
with a new customer, that relationship is
yours to mold, which means that you can
talk about more than just the eBay auc-
tion. When the auction ends, you will get
an e-mail with the results of the auction,
including the high bid amount and, most
importantly, the e-mail address of the
high bidder. You could use eBay’s invoic-
ing tool, but it is recommended to send
your own e-mail, welcoming that new
user to your Web store and describing
what you have for sale.

Click the Edit link for the Bio module to add your business information to the My World page. You’ll
be taken to a long form entitled Edit Bio Module. The first section of fields relates to your About Me
section of the Bio. First off, under Module Title, you probably want to select My Business from the
options given so customers know this is about your business, not necessarily your personal hobbies.
Feel free to treat the About Me section to talk more about your Web store, or about you as the store
owner. As you fill in information and scroll down the page, you should come to a header entitled
Business Information. This section should be fully completed, telling users all about your Web store,
like the hints I typed in each box for that section. You are free to advertise and promote your busi-
ness URL on this page, so don’t be shy. Definitely emphasize any keyword phrases you wish to pro-
mote for your Web store, as eBay sends the information from the My World pages to the search
engines. When you are done, click Save at the bottom of the page to save your work.

your profile. When you click the Add Content
link, you will be taken to the My World module
list. Initially, the only module that is added is
the Listings module, which details your eBay
sales. On the right-hand side, you should see
the other five modules you can add to your
page. The one you are interested in is Bio, as
that one allows you to define your Web store
and talk about your product offerings with some
detail. Click the Add link below Bio to add that
module to your My World page. Feel free to add
any other sections you would like, as well. Once
you have added a module, you can click the Edit
link to go in and update your information.

You’ll be taken back to the My World home page. Review the page
to make sure everything is displayed correctly. If you want to move
the content around on the page, you can click on the link marked
Change Layout to move the Bio section to the top, for example. If
you added any other Modules to your list, be sure to click the Edit
link next to that module and add information about your business
there as well.

S
ometimes, if you want to get attention you have to pay for it.
In the previous chapter we talk about ways to promote your
new Web store that are free (or very cheap) to use and required
some effort. There are other ways to get attention for your store,
and it has to do with the main way that most people use the
Internet nowadays — the search engines. Studies have been done
that show a majority of people start their Internet session by going
to a search engine, typing in some keywords, and clicking on a link
from the results screen to get started. Therefore, being on that
result screen can be very lucrative to your business. It’s like build-
ing a gas station at a highway off-ramp to attract customers from
the busy freeway overhead.
In this chapter, we talk about how your business can position itself
within the search engines to get traffic for your Web store. In the
first part, we look at a concept called Pay-Per-Click. Secondly, we
demonstrate how to send your Web store information to many different search
engines to help influence your “natural” or “organic” search results that are not
advertising-based. We also touch on banner advertisements and coordinating your
promotional campaigns. Finally, we walk you through the two main programs set up
for businesses to advertise on the search engines, namely Google Adwords and
Yahoo!’s Overture tool. 
Understanding Pay Per Click (PPC)
Advertising Campaigns
If you’ve used a search engine to find anything online, you’re probably familiar with
how the results screen looks after you type in your keywords and click Search. It’s
probably something similar to Figure 17-1, with the main part of the screen filled
with organic or natural search results that the search engine had in their database,
and the top and right sides of the screen filled with various advertisements.

Figure 17-1: Advertisements are put on the top and right of the page.
These advertisements are determined by the keywords typed in by the user. The
search engines accept advertisements that are tied into specific keywords or key-
word phrases. Any time that keyword or phrase is entered into their system, they
will display all the advertisements that are tied into the input. This way, it allows the
search engine to provide targeted advertising since they’re targeting specific users
who are more inclined to look at those ads than something chosen at random. For
example, if someone is looking for golf clubs, the search engine displays ads that are
written specifically for golf clubs.
Years ago, advertisers would have to pay for every impression (every time the ad is
simply displayed on the screen). However, they couldn’t afford to pay for ads that
most people ignored, so advertisers demanded a new system based on results.
Therefore, today’s system is based on how many times someone clicks on the adver-
tisement. This allows the search engines to collect more money per click, and allows
the advertiser to only pay for people who get sent to their Web site. Thus, we have
Pay Per Click advertising, or PPC.
Now, depending on how much an advertiser is willing to pay per click, the search
engines will give their best spot (a.k.a. the top spot on the screen) to the advertiser
who pays the most per click, and will determine the order of advertisements, from
top to bottom, based on the per click amount. Therefore, the higher you want your
ad placed on the screen, the more you have to pay for that position. Because you are
competing with other businesses for the same advertising spots, there is no fixed
price for a particular spot, as businesses are constantly changing their pay per click
amounts to improve their ad position. You don’t get to see your competitor’s bids
either, so it’s better to place your PPC bid based on your budget first.

Chapter 17: Online Marketing Campaigns
PPC campaigns provide several advantages for today’s business owners:

They are quick to establish and maintain. You could set up your campaign
and have traffic coming to your Web site within hours or a few days at most.

You don’t need a big budget to participate. You can set up a campaign for
$10, $100, $1,000, $10,000, $1,000,000, and any number in between. You set up
the rules so the ad campaign matches your budget, not the other way around.
When the money is spent, your ads no longer show up on the screen.

You can monitor your costs down to the penny. You establish your per
click rates, daily budgets, and total ad spending, and you can watch your
costs per day.

You can monitor the performance of your campaign. By encoding the links
your ads carry to send users to your site, you can monitor exactly how effec-
tive each campaign is by studying how many visitors who clicked to your site
actually placed an order, signed up as a customer, and so on. You can then
compare your profit from those orders to the cost of your ads and know the
benefits of this campaign (and how much to spend for future campaigns).

You can create multiple, highly focused campaigns. Instead of one big
flyer or catalog to promote all your items, you can create multiple ad cam-
paigns to focus on specific niches. Let’s say you sell electronics. You can
create one campaign for digital cameras, another for scanners, and yet
another for flat-screen TVs.
The biggest disadvantage to this type of advertising is when your sales don’t show
any improvement. You can pay to divert thousands, or even millions, of potential cus-
tomers to your Web site, depending on your budget. However, if all these people are
coming to your Web site and then leaving before they place an order, you just paid to
have a lot of window shoppers mill around without a cent of profit. Companies have
spent thousands of dollars getting the traffic and never did their homework to realize
that the traffic never equated to sales, orders, or profit. Don’t fall into this trap!

Search Engine Marketing For Dummies by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Submitting Your Store to the Search Engines
In addition to PPC campaigns that get your advertisements on the search engine
results screen, your store can also have a presence on the result screens in the natu-
ral search results section. The goal of any Web store owner is to see his or her store
in the top 10 results page for a Google or Yahoo! search. This way they aren’t paying
for results but getting an excellent placement which should lure more people to their
store.
The area of expertise in this field is called Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and
there are many books, for example Peter Kent’s Search Engine Optimization For
Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), and Web sites that can guide you on how to make
your Web store more friendly or receptive to the search engines. There are consult-
ants who will charge you to make over your entire Web site to get better results in

310

the search engines. It’s a growing field as more and more people try to outguess the
search engines and position their Web site for greater visibility.
Therefore, I’m going to leave this area as a task for self-study, as you could spend
two or 2,000 hours on this topic, depending on your free time. I recommend several
Web sites where you can read up on this topic and get lots of advice, as you can see
in Table 17-1.

The real answer about “getting in” to the search engines is that, sooner or later,
they’ll find you! The search engines have these computer programs known as bots or
spiders that crawl around the Internet and send information about every single Web
page that it finds back into the search engine database to be cataloged and ranked.
These computer programs go from Web site to Web site, following every link pro-
vided, and if you’re doing enough marketing where other sites are linking to you,
then the search engines will find you.
When you’re launching your Web store, however, you can take some action to speed
up this automatic process and hopefully get indexed into the search engines quicker.
You can, in some cases, submit your Web site information to the search engines, so
they’ll specifically send a computer program to look at your Web site and catalog
your pages. That’s what we’re going to discuss in this section.
Now, your first question should be, “Which sites should I submit my Web site to?”
The answer is, “As many as possible.” To get started, it’s helpful to get an idea of
which Web sites people are using to search the Internet. Go online and do a search
for search engine rankings, and eventually you’ll find a report like Nielsen/NetRatings
top search engine providers for the month, as shown in Figure 17-2. The top three will
almost always be Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft’s MSN AdCenter, but pay attention to
the others on the list, as we discuss the “other” search engines later in this section.
Now that you know where to go, the next question should be “How do I do it?” Let’s
start with the big kahuna, Google, and work our way down.

Submitting your site to Google
Ah, you want to be loved and included by Google. Okay, how about included? As
mentioned earlier, sooner or later Google will stumble onto your Web site and cata-
log your Web pages into their system. However, if you want to try and speed that up,
there are a couple of things you can do.
First, you can directly go to Google and use their Add URL function to add a mention
about your Web site to their computers, so their computer programs will go and
scan your Web site. There is no guarantee that doing this will speed up the process,
but it can’t hurt, and it’s free to use.

312
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
You simply go to www.google.com/addurl/ and you should see the Add URL
page, as shown in Figure 17-3. Then, you simply:

Put in the home page of your Web store in the URL field. Don’t forget to
add the http://. Only include the name of your Webpage if it is not
index.html or default.html.

Add a one-sentence description in the Comments field. Pick your most
important keywords from your store description and put one elegant, flow-
ing sentence here.

Enter the squiggly word into the box provided. This action is known as
security verification or human verification, because when you input the
word that appears in the graphic Google knows that a person is performing
that action, not a computer.

Scroll down and click on the Add URL button to submit your page.

Repeat the process for a few main category pages on your Web site.
Do not perform this function for every Web page on your store site, only
your main pages. Once Google sends a software robot or spider, they’ll pick
up all the pages on your Web site.
Figure 17-3: Add your URL to Google’s database.
The second thing you can do is feed Google an entire Site Map of your Web site, so
they know every single Web page that exists on your site. They have created some-
thing called Google Webmaster Tools, which you can sign up for free at http://
www.google.com/Webmasters/tools/ and get access to tools that can improve
your Google search position. They offer a tool called SiteMap Generator that will

313
Chapter 17: Online Marketing Campaigns
help you build a Site Map if you haven’t already done so. Check with your storefront
provider to see if you can install this tool on your Web store account. (It requires a
programming language known as Python to be readable on your Web store account.)
Read more about Google’s list of Webmaster tools at https://www.google.com/
Webmasters/tools/docs/en/about.html.
Finally, the quick way to check and see how many of your Web store pages are
already in Google’s database is to go to www.google.com and type in this code in
the search box:
site:www.yourstorename.com
In the above code, www.yourstorename.com is the name of your e-commerce
Web store. When you do this, you should see a results screen similar to the one in
Figure 17-4, which will show you all the different Web pages in your site that Google
has already cataloged. (If your site is brand new, Google says it can take up to a
month before you will appear in their database.) By running this “site” command,
you get an idea of which pages are cataloged and, by process of elimination, find out
which pages need to have better links.

Submitting your site to Yahoo!
Yahoo! is very similar to Google, in that their search engine robots will most likely
find your Web site eventually. They’ve also built some functionality to let you alert
them as to your Web site’s presence. Unlike Google, however, they have some paid
programs where you can pay Yahoo! a fee to include your Web store in their search
and/or directory. Like the PPC advertising campaigns discussed earlier in this chap-
ter, you are paying for placement, but unlike those programs you pay one fee (or a
yearly fee) for improved search results across the board.
When you are ready to submit your Web site to Yahoo!, go to their Submit Your Site
page at http://search.yahoo.com/info/submit.html (see Figure 17-5).
There are several options on this page, but the ones you mainly need to know are:

Submit Your Site for Free: This allows you to send your main URL informa-
tion to Yahoo!. They may (or may not) send a spider program to read your
site after you fill out this form. There is no guarantee.

Search Submit: You can guarantee that your Web site will be inserted into
the Yahoo! search index within four business days, and they’ll refresh their
index of your Web site every seven days. The cost is a recurring fee of $49
per year, per URL submission, and there’s a limit of five URL submissions
per person.

Yahoo! Directory Submit: You can guarantee that Yahoo! will consider
including your Web site in their core directory index within seven days.
There is no guarantee that your site will be accepted and included, but
they’ll review your site. The cost for this service is $299, and if your site is
accepted there is a recurring annual fee of $299 to keep your site in the
directory index.
If you’re a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions customer, you get a $50 discount
on Directory Submit and, sometimes, a discount on Search Submit. Log
into your Store Control Panel and check the Promotions section for more
information.
If you click on the Submit Your Site for Free link, you’ll be taken to their Site Explorer
page, shown in Figure 17-6. Enter the URL of your Web store in the box provided, and
if you are using RSS or Atom to feed information from your Web store automatically,
you can enter your feed file in the other box provided. When you click the Submit
button, the information will be sent to Yahoo!.

315
Chapter 17: Online Marketing Campaigns
Figure 17-5: Yahoo! gives you different ways to submit your site.
As for the premium services, let me say this. One of the ways search engines judge
Web sites for their relevance and ranking is by how many other Web sites have a link
to your Web site. More importantly, the search engines look at the quality of that
link, meaning they rank those incoming links based on the reputation of the Web site
linking to you, the length of time that Web site has been registered, the popularity of
that Web site, the position of the link, and so on. If your store gets included in
Yahoo!’s directory, that is one of the most respected and powerful links your store
can have, in terms of popularity, and that’ll increase all your search engine results
for Yahoo!, Google, and all the other search engines. Trust me, there’s a reason why
it costs $299 per year, and that’s why.
Google’s most trusted directory source for their search engine rankings seems to be
a human-powered directory site called The Open Directory, at www.dmoz.org. To
find out more about submitting your site to the Open Directory Project, simply go to
http://www.dmoz.org/add.html.

Figure 17-6: Submit your site to Yahoo! for free. 
Submitting your site to everyone else
At this point, many people think that they’ve covered their bases by submitting to
both Google and Yahoo!, as those two search engines make up a large majority of
people’s Web search queries. However, those two don’t make up 100 percent of the
searches done on the Internet, so it’s worth looking at some of the other major and
minor players.
In fact, there are great reasons to go ahead and submit to the other search engines.
Google and Yahoo! go out and see what the other search engines have cataloged, so
when your Web site gets included in these other search engines, it’ll be seen as a ref-
erence for Google and Yahoo! and help you in your standings.
Therefore, if you have some time go through Table 17-2 and add your Web site URL
(like the Google and Yahoo! free submissions above) so you cover as many bases as
possible. While some sites like Ask.com have removed their submission page, others
like Microsoft have kept theirs open for submittals. Other sites that draw on multiple
search engines, like Dogpile and MetaCrawler, have no internal database of their
own, so there is nothing to submit to in those cases.

There are a number of paid search inclusion services, from sites like Enhance.com
that allow you to advertise on Dogpile, Metacrawler, and other search sites, to serv-
ices that offer to submit your site to tens or hundreds of the search engines for you
automatically. Do your homework on those services, and decide if you want to pay
the money to have these services promote your site. 
While you can never reach every Internet site on your own, submitting your site to
the major and mid-level players is typically enough to get your store noticed. Your
goal should always be to keep your Web store updated and keep your customers
happy. Your marketing techniques and efforts will be reflected as customers mention
you and other Web sites link to you.

of your target customers. You can pick cus-
tomers based on country, or narrow it down to
a specific state or province, a city, or even a zip
code. Additionally, you are asked what language
you’re using in your ad (the default is English,
but you can pick whatever language you’d like
to write your ad).

Creating a Yahoo! Overture Campaign
While Google gets a lot of the press mentions and attention, Yahoo! still
commands a sizable portion of the search audience, as they have tens
of millions of members who use their various functions, such as Mail,
Finance, and of course, Merchant Solutions. Back in 2003, they pur-
chased a company called Overture (previously GoTo.com) that was
using the pay per click method to sell advertising on their member net-
works. Now that Overture is a Yahoo! company, it is the tool that Yahoo!
uses for its search engine result pages, as well as the advertising tool
for all their functions and Web pages.

want to run a test marketing campaign for a cer-
tain region, you can select Specific Regions and
enter your specific target area in the fields that
are prompted. Otherwise, leave the selection on
Entire Market to make sure your ad is shown to
users in the entire region.
4.
Once your account has been created, you will
need to complete a five-step process to start
your sponsored search campaign. In the first
step, you need to establish your geographic
location, as that will impact elements like your
reports and campaign management. Select your
country of business from the list provided, and
then select your time zone from that list pro-
vided. When you’re ready, click the Get Started
button to continue.
3.
In this step, you need to register for your
account by confirming your contact information,
credit card on file, username, and reviewing
their Terms and Conditions. You should see
the Registration page, and if you’re already a
Merchant Solutions customer (or Yahoo! account
holder) then this information will be pre-filled. If
you’re a new user, simply complete the fields.
When you scroll down, you’ll see the section to
enter your credit card information, which Yahoo!
will keep on file to charge you based on your ad
campaigns. Below the credit card info is the
place to put your user ID (if you’re not already
a Yahoo! user, this is blank) and below that is
where you review the Terms and Conditions.
When you have completed each section, click
the Order button to start your account.

In the third step, Yahoo! will ask for a daily
spending limit. Yahoo! does warn you that they
may go up to 10 percent above your daily limit
if necessary, and if they go above that 10 per-
cent threshold, you’ll need to file for a refund
with them. If you have a monthly budget in
mind, adjust it for a daily amount. If you want to
see an estimate of how many ads you’ll get,
click the Estimate button after entering your
daily amount. You’ll be prompted by Yahoo! for
a recommended bid amount per phrase, and
based on that bid amount, you will see an esti-
mated number of monthly ad impressions (how
many times your ad will be displayed per
month) and clicks on that ad. If you change
your maximum bid and click Estimate, you will
see a new set of estimated figures. Click the
Next button when you are ready to proceed.
7.
Yahoo! will go through their search records and
show you keyword phrases similar to the ones
you entered, and, for each phrase they recom-
mend you add, you’ll see the estimated number
of times that phrase is searched for per month.
This way, you can get an idea of which phrases
are the most popular and a rough idea of how
many people will see your ad, based on the
phrase(s) you add. When you are done, click
the Next button to proceed.
6.
In the second step, you’re asked to enter the
list of keyword phrases that you want to trigger
your advertisement. You want to pick the best
keywords or phrases that customers would
type in to find a store like yours, and type them
in the box. You can provide up to 50 different
keywords or phrases here. Click the Next
button when you are ready to proceed.
The more specific your keywords and phrases, the better chance you have of redirecting a more serious cus-
tomer. If someone types in DVD player, odds are they’re just browsing for general information. If someone types
in Sony BDP-S1 Blu-Ray DVD player, odds are they’re ready or close to buying one.You may get less leads, but
they’re more “qualified” and should ultimately lead to better conversion rates.

If you want to track the effectiveness of your ad campaign, you can direct it to a special page only available
from this ad, so you can monitor the results.
If you really want to study up on Yahoo! Sponsored Search, or PPC advertising in general, you should definitely
consider getting Pay Per Click Search Engine Marketing For Dummies by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), as
he goes through all the leading programs in this area and provides lots of ideas, processes, and ways to manage
your campaign.
10. In the fifth and final step, you’ll review and acti-
vate your ad on Yahoo!. You’ll see the Review
window. Look over the ad you created, and
click the Edit button on the right-hand side if
you need to go back and make any changes.
Otherwise, go down and enter your account
information in the boxes provided. Once you’re
done with that, scroll down the page and click
the orange Activate Now button to get started.
9.
In the fourth step, you are asked to Create your
Ad. You’ll see a window where you will develop
your search engine ad. You will have a space to
enter your Ad Title, your Ad Description, and
the URL where your potential customers will be
sent after they click your ad. Your key here is to
highlight the important keywords that will grab
your customer’s attention and mention any
important distinguishing features of your store.
Look at your competitor’s ads for inspiration
(don’t copy and paste their ads, though) and
think about what you would need to see, as a
potential customer, to click on that ad. When
you’re done, click the Next button to proceed.
11. You’re done! The Yahoo! Sponsored Search account has been
created for your business, and you’ll be charged for the initial
setup and deposit into your account. Your ads will start showing
up on searches, and if you need to make any changes, log into
your Search Marketing account to make any necessary updates.

B
y this point, your Web store should be open to the public,
taking orders, and growing in terms of popularity. You
should be hitting several milestones as you operate your store,
reaching your first month in business, first quarter in business,
first year in business, and hopefully many more milestones to
come. As you hit your milestones, and begin to handle a volume of
orders and the joys of day-to-day operations, you may be giving
some thought to the future — namely, “How am I going to handle
everything if orders continue to increase?” At some point, you’ll
need to consider outsourcing elements of your store so you can
focus on what you do best. After all, Jeff Bezos could only pack
orders on his concrete garage floor for so long with his employees
before he had to get his company, Amazon.com, some warehouses
and distribution centers.
In this chapter, we discuss some of the more common steps taken by Web store
owners when their businesses start to grow, in terms of outsourcing and re-design.
We talk about questions to consider and how to evaluate someone before you bring
them on. We discuss how to expand the reach of your store by looking at partner-
ships and, in some cases, how you can create your own affiliate program for the
products you sell in your store. We then walk you through a site called Elance, where
you can find contractors for jobs ranging from Web site redesign to writing new soft-
ware for your store.
Finding Someone to Handle Fulfillment
When I’ve talked with various e-commerce store owners over the years, I noticed
one common trend — almost all of them picked their order fulfillment as the first
thing to hire employees for or outsource. Nobody really starts their business dream-
ing of all the time they’ll spend packing and shipping out customer’s orders. They
just want to turn their business idea into a viable operation, and the fulfillment is
simply a necessary piece of the overall picture. As business owners begin to run out
of time and resources, they realize that in order to focus on what they do best, they
should turn over fulfillment operations to someone else who does that function the
best . . . or at least better.

Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
When some people think of outsourcing fulfillment, they assume that only the largest
companies can hire someone like UPS to re-route thousands of packages from far-flung
warehouses in a fully computerized system. The truth is that there are a number of ful-
fillment houses, or companies who serve the small business community, by grouping
together several companies’ outsourcing needs into one warehouse with one staff.
Deciding whether to outsource
When you’re ready to start the outsourcing process, the first step is deciding
whether to hire an employee to handle the packing and shipping within your opera-
tion or to set up a contract with a fulfillment house and have that company do all the
packing and shipping for you. As you try to decide, keep a few guidelines in mind:

Figure out a budget. You can’t go shopping if you don’t know how much
you can spend, right? Take a look at the orders coming in, figure out how
much of a budget you can afford to handle the problem, and come up with
an average amount per order that you can spend. This will help you decide
whether an outside company will qualify as an option. Remember that you’ll
be freeing up some employee time with an outsourcing partner, so factor
that into your budget.

Think about your physical space requirements. For some companies, out-
sourcing becomes a necessity because they no longer have the physical
space needed to accommodate inventory storage and a packing/shipping
area. Look at your current space usage, and do some estimates based on
past sales data on your future space needs. If you’re operating a seasonal
store, like selling Christmas gifts, then your space estimates should be
based on your peak demand. The last thing you should have is a crammed
warehouse in the middle of your critical order season.

Decide how much can be handled off-site. If you sell products that require
a lot of customization before being shipped, then perhaps you need to keep
the fulfillment inside your company and hire some employees or independ-
ent contractors. If you’re simply acting as a warehouse and perform zero
customization, then you’re more likely to benefit from a fulfillment house.

Determine the location of your customers. As your company starts to grow,
you should be building your customer database, and hopefully you’ll be notic-
ing some trends regarding your customer’s location. If, for example, many of
your customers are located in one region of the country, you could save
money by locating your fulfillment center closer to that customer base. At the
very least, the cost savings could pay for the labor required to outsource ful-
fillment, and it would speed up order delivery, which should lead to increased
customer satisfaction. Remember to factor in the delivery costs from your
product source to your fulfillment center. If your customers are wide-spread,
then minimize costs by locating your fulfillment near your product source.
Finding an outsourcing partner
If you’ve decided to outsource your fulfillment, your first step is to locate a provider.
Unfortunately, there isn’t a handy tab in the Yellow Pages for Outsourcing or
Fulfillment. Instead, you need to do some research online and find companies that fit

331
Chapter 18: Outsourcing Store Elements — Going to the Next Level
your service needs or are located near you. I have compiled a list of some example
fulfillment houses, which you can find in Table 18-1.
Talk to fellow business owners at chamber of commerce events, SBA workshops, or
talk to your vendors or manufacturers to see if they can recommend a company.
While an Internet search can turn up a lot of names, it’s always recommended to do
a search on message boards and forums to see if anyone has had a bad experience
with one of those companies.

Talk to more than one company and get competitive quotes from each. Treat this
like a job interview, but instead of hiring a direct employee you’re hiring someone to
do their work away from your watchful eye. As you talk to them, keep these ques-
tions in mind to help you find the right partner:

What kind of service level can you guarantee? When a fulfillment house
handles your packing and shipping, it’s still your company name on the
invoice, which means that any problems or inconsistencies get blamed on
you, not the shipper. You need to know that this company will represent
your company well to your customers, since the only point of physical con-
tact in your business is when the package carrier hands over the box to
your customer.

What is your complete fee structure, and what do you charge for additional
services? Many companies will easily quote you their per-order charge, and
the most popular surcharges, like per item charges, one-time setup fees, and
maintenance or storage fees. For example, eFulfillmentService.com lists their
different fees on their Web site, as shown in Figure 18-1. However, you should
try to get as complete a price list as possible so you’re not surprised down
the road when they hit you with a bunch of small fees that quickly add up.
Sometimes, companies can offer low prices because they collect their rev-
enue through a maze of fees. Add everything up in advance, and compare
similar packages with all the fees included.

Have you or are you handling clients similar to my business? Ideally, you
would like a fulfillment house that has some experience in your type of Web
store. This way, they may be able to identify potential problems because their
similar clients experienced those problems first. If your products require spe-
cial packaging or handling, a fulfillment company with past experience will
handle those needs more effectively than someone who is learning at your
expense. Some companies detail their niche expertise, as shown in Figure 18-2.

332
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
Figure 18-1: eFulfillmentService.com breaks down their different fees.
Figure 18-2: Consider a company who’s experienced handling your niche of business.

333
Chapter 18: Outsourcing Store Elements — Going to the Next Level

Can you handle product returns, and if so, what are the costs? When there’s
shipping, there’s usually a need for returns. Once you set up a fulfillment
house to stock and ship your products, you most likely want them to handle
your returns so the inventory can be re-shelved or discarded without insert-
ing another step (you) into the process. Find out all the costs involved,
including the sorting and evaluation time when a returned item is processed,
and whether they’ll ship a return label to your customer automatically.

How much experience do you have in this area? You’re looking for some-
one who’s handled this kind of operation before, not necessarily some new
startup that is hoping to learn as time goes on. If possible, ask for refer-
ences of past clients who are satisfied, and talk to those people about their
impressions of this fulfillment house.

What kind of reports or information do I get? As time goes on, you want to
be able to monitor the effects of this new relationship, and some fulfillment
houses will be able to provide you with detailed reports about order turn-
around, percentage of returns received, average cost per package, and so on.

What are your minimum levels for taking an account? If you’re still unsure,
or want to see this process in action before you fully commit to it, ask if you
can turn over a small portion of your fulfillment operations first and then
evaluate their service after a determined period of time. When you find out
their minimums, you can decide if you can give them a test run or if they’ll
only accept your entire business.
Hiring Someone to (Re)Design Your Store
Let’s turn our attention away from packing and shipping and talk about another
important element in any Web store — the Web site design. One of the unwritten
rules of doing business online is that customers expect something new, fresh, and
exciting as often as you can provide it. Perhaps that’s why blogs are doing so well,
because of all the new content that’s added weekly, or even daily!
Web design is a constantly changing and evolving concept. If you’ve looked at the
different styles over the past decade, you’ll notice that some trends have come and
gone, with popular sites such as eBay or Amazon rolling out brand new designs on
an average of 12 to 18 months, with smaller changes happening all the time. The Web
community learns from each other and studies the patterns and techniques that
their fellow Web site owners are using.
Therefore, if you’ve been running your Web store for a while and your customers are
looking for “the next level,” you might consider hiring someone to redesign your Web
site. Perhaps you may have implemented a simple design to get your store online,
and now you want to portray a more professional image to attract a bigger audience.
Whatever the case may be, consider hiring a professional to handle the job.
When you redesign your Web site, remember to keep the interface clean and fast-
loading, regardless of what any hired professional recommends to add to your Web
site design. If you completely overhaul the interface, make sure existing customers
can “re-find” items in an intuitive manner, without too many Web “bells and whistles”
getting in the way.

334
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
When it comes to specific jobs like Web site re-design, you don’t need to hire a full-
time employee to handle this job. You don’t even have to hire someone who is local
to your area, though you may want someone to discuss the project with face-to-face.
There are lots of qualified freelancers around the world that can take on your assign-
ment and deliver the results electronically, by uploading your Web pages and graph-
ics to your Web site for you, as an example. You can post your job requirements on
several different places on the Internet, including:

Elance (www.elance.com)

Craigslist (jobs.craigslist.org)

Guru.com (www.guru.com)

Rentacoder (www.rentacoder.com)
We take a look at how to post your project on Elance later in this chapter. When
going to any of these companies, or using a local favorite, you should definitely keep
a few things in mind, which will help control your costs and yield a better product:

Write down a plan of your major goals for this project. While I don’t
expect you to be able to list the 25 specific commands your designer should
integrate into your Web site, I do expect you to write down what you like to
see when the project is done. It helps to give your designer a roadmap of
your goals so they spend their valuable time doing the designing and not
brainstorming with you. Ask them questions, draw from their experience,
but remember that you’re paying the bills, so have them fulfill your goals,
not their own.

Develop a schedule with specific goals. Talk with your developer to come
up with a schedule or time-line that contains measurable milestones so you
can monitor progress and agree on intermediate steps. This way, you don’t
get to the end of the project and find that you hate their entire effort. The
easiest way to enforce these milestones and periodic reviews is to tie pay-
ment to these dates, so they get paid only when they achieve specific goals
that lead to the overall success of the project.

Get everything written as a contract. This contract should not only include
the basic agreement of what tasks they will perform and the schedule, but
there should be provisions that discuss what happens if overtime is
required (and the costs associated with that), how change requests are han-
dled, and what steps must be taken to dissolve the contract. It’s better to
talk about all potential circumstances first than to have a problem arise
during the project with no way of handling it. Have your contractor sign the
contract and sign it yourself, or at the very least, exchange e-mail agree-
ments of the contract.

Establish ownership of the work they do. Since they are performing this
work on a work-for-hire arrangement, make sure that you and your business
have sole ownership of the project work they provide. Have this stipulated
in any agreement or contract you develop with them. They’ll probably ask
for the right to include this work in a portfolio they use to get new jobs, and
that is fine. Just make sure they don’t have the right to re-sell the work, or
you may see your five big competitors with the same Web site as you!

335
Chapter 18: Outsourcing Store Elements — Going to the Next Level
Creating an Affiliate Program 
for Your Products
As a small business looking to grow to the next level, there is a way that you can
increase your sales force without hiring extra personnel to go out and sell for you. In
fact, you won’t pay any additional money until your qualified lead or sale comes in
the door. You can accomplish this by creating your own affiliate program. An affiliate
program is where you pay another business (or person, or Web site) when they pro-
vide you with a sale or qualified lead, like a new customer who enrolls in your Web
site. They help connect you with the customer, and in exchange for that effort, you
pay the affiliate a commission, either a percentage of the sale or a fixed amount of
money.
Because there are so many products available on the Internet, and eager marketers
looking for something to sell, there are lots of affiliate programs out there today. You
can join a clearinghouse of affiliates, like Commission Junction (www.cj.com)
shown in Figure 18-3, or Shareasale (www.shareasale.com) and have your pro-
gram available to thousands of affiliate marketers, or you can develop your own
program in-house.
Figure 18-3: Commission Junction can build and manage your affiliate program.

336
Part V: Promotion and Outsourcing of Your Web Store 
An affiliate program can work with almost any product or service you provide, not
just e-books or digital content. You can offer an affiliate program on any products
that you manufacture or wholesale, or offer a referral bonus program for people who
bring you new customers or leads.
If you’re interested in starting up an affiliate program for your Web store, you can
submit your interest to Commission Junction (CJ) by filling out their information
request form at http://www.cj.com/advertisers/information_request.
html, as shown in Figure 18-4, and someone at CJ will get back to you and schedule
a consultation so you can get more information and, hopefully, get started with their
program.
Figure 18-4: Get more information from CJ about their affiliate programs.
You can also check with your storefront provider and your shopping cart software to
see if there is built-in technology that will allow you to create affiliate ID’s on your
own and establish your own program. You could also manually track the progress of
a few selected trial affiliate members by supplying them with one of the following:

A special link they must use to send their customers to your Web site, as
follows:
<a href=”http://www.yourcompanyname.com?id=xxx”>Click here
to buy from YourCompanyName!</a>
This way, your server logs will keep track of the different ID numbers that are
used to access your site, and you can manually compute how much you owe
each affiliate from the number of times their ID appears in the server log.

337
Chapter 18: Outsourcing Store Elements — Going to the Next Level

A copy of your home page, in a different directory, and a link to that
copy, like this:
<a
href=”http://www.yourcompanyname.com/affil/name1.ht
ml”>Click here to buy from YourCompanyName!</a>
Similar to the first option, your server logs will keep track of how many
people go to this Web page. Your storefront provider should have a report
to show you the page views for each of these pages, so you can get an accu-
rate count that way. Obviously, don’t mention or link to this page from any-
where else, as you don’t want people stumbling into someone’s affiliate link
and lose money on that sale.

A special promotional code or identifier that their customers must put in
their order form before they can checkout.
This option is much easier for you to track, since you have to go through
only the orders received to track your affiliates’ progress, and you can
specifically tie an order to an affiliate. The downside to this option is that
their customers may forget to enter the promotional code, which means
affiliates may feel like they’re not getting accurate credit.
The keys to providing a good affiliate program are this: good incentives and good
promotional support. Make the reward worth your affiliates’ time, and provide them
with enough promotional material, banner advertisements, graphics, and support
they need to promote your Web store products and get paid easily.

Placing Your Project on Elance
Elance is a marketplace for people to find and hire service professionals for
a variety of tasks that can be done over the Internet, from writing to Web
design to computer software programming. You can either search their
database for a qualified person who specializes in a given area, or create a
request for the project you wish to have done. That request is then posted
on Elance, and you’ll receive bids on your project from people or compa-
nies who want to perform that task for you. Once you get several bids, you
look through them, investigate the profiles of the people bidding, and
choose one to handle your project. From there, Elance will help you moni-
tor the status of your project and coordinate payment once the project is
completed.

You’ll see the registration screen. In the first
phase, Enter Contact Information, you’ll need to
create a user ID and password that you’ll use to
access your Elance account, and provide your
e-mail address, first and last name, and a phone
number where Elance can reach you. This
phone number will not be available for any con-
tractors to see. Click Continue when you’re
ready to proceed.

Go to the Elance Web site at www.elance.com
and click the Post Your Project button. Be
aware that when you go to Elance, they have
created multiple categories to handle requests
in different areas.
Elance has developed Elance Packages which are fixed-price packages of specific tasks that they offer through
preferred partners.The advantage to these is that they are fixed price, so you don’t have to worry about cost
overruns or a low rate designer charging you way too many hours for a simple task.The disadvantage is that the
package may not fit your individual needs.

Chapter 18: Outsourcing Store Elements — Going to the Next Level
4.
In the third phase, Describe Your Project, you’ll
need to describe your project in some detail.
When you get to the Project detail page, you’ll
see a number of steps that Elance presents to
get all the information needed for a project
request. In Step 1, you need to create a Project
Title that is meaningful and represents the type
of work that will be done (for example “Website
Redesign,” “Update customer database,” and so
on). In Step 2, you have 3700 characters to
describe the project you want performed.
Remember, stick to high-level goals and actions,
as this is not the space for specifics.
5.
Scroll down to Step 3 and give Elance the
parameters of the project proposal. You’ll need
to decide how many days you’ll leave the proj-
ect open for bidding, the approximate start
date of the project, your estimated budget, and
whether you want to pay your freelancer a
fixed price or an hourly rate to work on this
project. Step 4 of the process asks if you want
to pay the freelancer directly, or use an escrow
service through Elance. If you want to enforce
milestone completion, then you will need to
select escrow service.
3.
In the second phase, Select Your Project
Category, you need to select the project cat-
egory that fits the job request you are
making. Elance has organized their project
request database into eleven distinct cate-
gories, from Administrative Support to
Writing and Translation. Pick the category
that best describes your project. Once
you’ve picked your category (in this case, we
are picking Web site Development), you’ll
see a list of matching sub-categories for the
selected category. Pick the sub-category that
best describes your project (in this case, it’s
Web Design) and then scroll down the page
to click Continue and proceed.

You’ll see a credit card information screen.
Provide the basic details for your credit card in
the fields provided. There is a box to check for
authenticating your credit card, if you plan to
pay your freelancer with your credit card. By
leaving this box checked, Elance will put two
small deposits on your credit card and then ask
you for those amounts. When you correctly
identify the amounts, this verifies to Elance
that you own that credit card, and you will be
allowed to pay your freelancers with the credit
card. Allow approximately four business days
for this authentication process to be complete.
6.
Scroll down to Step 5 and answer the demo-
graphic questions there. Step 6 asks you if you
want to upload any files that better explain the
project. Click the button if you’ve written up
your proposal, and attach the correct file. In the
final part, Step 7, Elance will ask you whether
your project proposal can be filled only by
select providers that are pre-screened by
Elance and offer a higher level of quality pro-
posals, as well as privately submitted propos-
als. You can also open up your project request
to the entire community, where freelancers can
see the competing proposals.
If you pick the Select Level of provider, Elance will charge you a deposit to make your project request, and
require a higher minimum value of the project. If you successfully find a provider for your proposal, or very few
people bid on your project, the deposit is refunded to you.

You’re done! Your request is added to the
Elance database, and you should start to get
some proposals soon, depending on the com-
plexity of the project. You can monitor the
status of your request by clicking the My Elance
link and looking in your account to see if any
questions or proposals have been submitted.
8.
In the final phase of this process, Confirm Your
Project Description, you’ll see a summary
screen based on the project proposal you have
been entering. Look over the details to make
sure you inputted everything correctly, since
the proposals you’ll receive will be based on the
information you’re giving them here. Click the
Post Project Now button to submit your

Chapter 19
Ten Things Every Web Store Needs
T
he essentials of a Web store should be clear: You need shopping cart soft-
ware, a catalog of products (or other items) to sell, a storefront provider to
host your Web store, and at least one payment method of accepting credit cards
over the Internet. I’ve gone over a lot of additional things that are a part of most
Web stores, and functions and areas that can enhance any Web store.
In this chapter, however, I discuss the ten elements that every Web store should
have, independent of the catalog, shopping cart, and so forth. These are the ele-
ments that customers are always asking about, and secretly (or openly) complaining
about when they don’t see these on a Web store they visit. Some of these are consid-
ered “deal-breakers” for lots of people, meaning if you don’t have it, they move on to
a Web store that does have it. Others are critical enough that it could mean the dif-
ference between a new order being placed and someone going off to buy from a
competitor . . . and telling 20 people why they didn’t shop with you.
Contact Information Page
Surprisingly, when I did an informal survey of different Web customers and develop-
ers, this was the number one thing mentioned that every Web store should have.
Even if a customer will never have the need to contact a Web store owner to ask a
question or make a complaint, it creates the sense of trust and legitimacy that a Web
store owner can be contacted.
Additionally, the more contact methods provided, the better. Because the Internet
gives your customer a disconnected experience, they want as many ways as possible
to get in touch with a store owner or employee. If for no other reason, you should
provide multiple contact methods because different people prefer different methods,
and you don’t want to isolate a section of your customer base.
You should consider providing as many of these as possible:

Telephone number

E-mail address (branded to your store; yourstorename@hotmail.com or
@yahoo.com looks unprofessional)

Fax number

Postal mail address

Instant Message (AIM, ICQ, and so on) or chat ID

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In the next chapter, I cover a design tip related to the contact information page —
make it as accessible as possible throughout your entire Web store.
Stellar Navigation
While contact information was the most popular item mentioned, a close second has
to be excellent navigation for your Web store. You simply must have some sort of
navigation bar or system to let people access different sections of your Web store.
Some people use tabs, other people use buttons, while others simply use plain text.
The point, however, is to have clear, consistent navigation that easily takes cus-
tomers between sections of your Web store.
It’s recommended that, regardless of the method you use to display your navigation
bar (along the top or left-hand side of your screen), you include a second navigation
bar in plain text only along the bottom of your home page. This way, the search
engines can read your text navigation bar and access the different parts of your Web
store, in case they can’t decipher the buttons or graphics you use for your top/left
navigation bar.
Clear and Complete Shipping Policy
Unless you’re selling only digital or downloadable products, you’ll have to ship out
the orders to your customers. Obviously, you have to advertise the price of your
products to your customers so they can decide whether to order from you.
Additionally, however, customers want to know the full price of their order, including
shipping, before they place their order or create an account with your store.
Therefore, you need to have a clear, complete, and comprehensive shipping policy
spelled out on your store for customers to access.
Not only is it important for customers to know the different shipping options (by the
way, the more options, the better; if you haven’t picked up the clues I’ve dropped,
customers like choice), but you need to set up the correct expectations for shipping
delivery times and arrival procedures, like whether the package will have to be
signed for by a live person or left on the doorstep. This is not a retail environment,
where you hand the customer a plastic bag containing their order and they walk
away. The customer is counting on your shipping to be fast and accurate, and they
want that product the moment they clicked the Order button.
Clear Return Policy
Before a customer decides to plunk down their money and purchase something from
a Web store, they want to know their options in case the order isn’t handled prop-
erly, the item doesn’t work upon delivery, and any other scenarios that may occur.
Therefore, you need to have a clear return policy that explains, in detail, what you’ll
provide and what situations you’ll cover (and not cover) in case a problem arises.

347
Chapter 19: Ten Things Every Web Store Needs
At the bare minimum, your return policy should contain the following elements:

Is the product returnable? If so, do they return it to you or the manufacturer?

How long does the customer have to report a problem after the order
arrives? A week? 10 days? 30 days?

Who pays for return shipping? If the item arrives broken, who pays for
return shipping?

Does the customer have to pay a restocking fee if they return the item for
any reason? (A restocking fee is a charge that a retailer implements to cover
the cost of receiving an opened item and putting it back in their inventory.)

Are there any products or conditions where the return policy does not apply?
Security (SSL Certificate)
Given all the fraud and identity theft concerns that have plagued Internet customers
these past years, your customers are going to demand that any sensitive information,
especially financial information like credit card or bank account data, be transmitted
securely using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate on your Web store that encrypts
the data being entered.
Never have your customers send you their sensitive information in an e-mail! Most
won’t do this anyway, but never offer this as an option.
If your storefront provider or payment processor doesn’t offer an SSL-protected Web
page for you to gather financial data from your customers, then you’ll need to create
your own SSL certificate and make your own secure page to get the data. Discuss the
details with your Web host or storefront provider, as the steps vary depending on
your individual setup.
You can also check out THAWTE at www.thawte.com to have them help you create
the right SSL certificate for your Web store.
Fast Loading Pages
Internet users want their shopping experience to be fast, easy, and convenient. After
all, they could get into their cars, drive in traffic, hunt for a parking spot, walk into a
mall or department store, fight the crowds, walk aisle by aisle, grab different items,
try or inspect them, walk to the checkout area, wait in line, pay for their item, walk
back to their car, fight traffic again to get home, and then get into their house with
the shopping bag(s) in hand.
On the Internet, they want a smooth process. If they go to your Web store and have to
wait for pictures to display or functions to start up, and they’re staring at a blank page
or a page that is slowly drawing the picture, it’s like they’re stuck in their car, put on
hold when calling someone, or waiting in a long, slow line at the store. When cus-
tomers have to wait, and every other Web store is just a click or some typing away,
guess what will happen? Yep, you guessed it — they’ll take off and try someone else.

Customer Testimonials
Your Internet customers will typically not be able to see you, which means they need
a level of trust to do business with you. A professional-looking Web store, with a
great selection, competitive prices, and maybe some additional functions, is the first
step to building that trust. If you want to build an additional level of trust to help
ease your customer’s minds, let them know that other people were in their situation
and had a great experience. You can do this by showing or displaying customer testi-
monials on your Web store.
This accomplishes several goals in building that extra level of trust. When someone
reads that another customer enjoyed getting a product, it’s like giving that product an
unofficial thumbs up or seal of approval. The testimonial gives new customers confi-
dence that you have been in business awhile and are not planning on running away
with their money. It lets customers know that someone else was pleased with how
you, the store owner, handled their order, so they have more confidence that their
order will be handled the same way. Finally, it gives current customers a chance to
shine and feel recognized, which can lead to increased loyalty and repeat purchases.
Confirmation Page After an Order
At first glance, it sounds simple enough. If someone places an order, they want to
actually see the words “Your order has been placed.” They want some confirmation
that their order was placed successfully and the product is being sent to them. After
all, there could have been an issue with the Internet connection and perhaps not all
the information was transmitted successfully. Yes, they’ll see the charge on their
credit card, but the customer wants to know that their order was received and it will
be processed.
While you may be concerned with streamlining the process, it is wise to include that
final step in the ordering flow that acknowledges the order was received. It doesn’t
necessarily have to be a separate Web page that displays this, but an additional sen-
tence added to an existing page, in boldface or in a larger font. The confirmation
message is an excellent place to reinforce the expected shipping time of the order,
and can include a reminder that their order information is accessible from the cus-
tomer information section of your Web store.
Clear Product Descriptions
For some Web store owners, the descriptions that they get from the manufacturer
seem to be complete. However, this is typically because the owner is familiar with
the product already. The question you have to ask yourself is, “Is the description
clear enough for my customer?” Some customers need more than a one-sentence
description or a laundry list of indecipherable bullet points that spout some jargon
they may or may not understand. They’re looking for clarification, for reassurance,
for proof that this product solves their need.

349
Chapter 19: Ten Things Every Web Store Needs
Therefore, you may need to go back and update or add information in the product
description, so it is clear to anyone what they’re purchasing. The first paragraph
alone should contain all the vital information necessary to know what they’re pur-
chasing. You can also include information on the benefits of the product, not just the
technical features. Remember, you’re not just selling a product, you’re selling a solu-
tion to a problem.
Third-Party Certifications
No doubt you’ve spent a fair amount of time constructing your Web store, so you
know it’s good. You’ve tested it, checked for accuracy and function, and you’re ready
to take orders and go live. However, as I mentioned before, you need to build that
level of trust so customers are ready to give you their money and order from you.
One way to do that is to approach third-party companies who can verify that your
company or business is legitimate and safe for doing business.
Some examples of certifications or companies to approach include:

Verisign (www.verisign.com)

The Better Business Bureau (www.bbbonline.org)

Shopzilla, formerly BizRate (merchant.shopzilla.org)

SiteSafe from Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com)

Ten Tips for Designing Your Web Store
W
hen it comes to design tips, your overall goal is always to provide an easy
and clear experience for your customers to interact with you. If your store
fits the needs of your buyers they’ll consider shopping from you, and if you serve
them with good products at a good price with excellent customer service you’ll
hopefully retain them as repeat customers. Therefore, after discussion with lots of
different Web store owners, customers, and design professionals, these were the
ten things I heard over and over that you should think about when designing your
own Web store. Enjoy!
Keep It Simple and Professional
By far, this was the number one thing I heard when talking to anyone else about how
to design your Web store. While I discuss adding functionality and content to give
your customers a reason to come back and use your business often, you should
never let your Web store look like an overgrown, unmanageable mess of pictures,
text, and functions. At any time, any visitor should be able to come to your Web store
and understand what they are seeing, whether it is their first or their 100th visit.
Understand, however, that simple can sometimes evolve into amateurish, and that’s
not something you want either. When someone is planning to spend their hard-
earned money with you, the last image you want to convey is a Web store that looks
like it was thrown together in 30 minutes by a second grade student. You want to
convey a professional image, with clean lines, crisp graphics, and a straightforward
interface.
Make the Contact Information Easy to Find
I mentioned in the last chapter that a Contact Info page is one of the top ten things
you should have for your Web store. When you’re designing your store, however,
there’s another cardinal rule to consider: Your contact information should be easily
accessible from any page on your Web store. Yes, you should have your contact info
prominently featured on your home page. But you may think, “Why would they need
my phone number if they’re browsing my catalog or reading an article?” The answer
is simple: If they have a question, problem, concern, or even a suggestion, they want
to be able to immediately contact you while they’re thinking about it. If they have to
click around and hunt for that information, many of them will get upset, leave your
Web store, and most likely never return.

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In a retail store, you can approach the customer before they storm out the door. In a
Web store, you don’t get that physical opportunity, so make it as easy as possible for
that customer to find a way to contact you, no matter where they are on your site.
You’ll never be able to guess every single time someone has a question, so make that
contact information accessible anywhere they can be, and make sure that link or
button is in the same place on every page, too.
Simple, Organized Navigation Bar
I know we cover this point in detail in the book, but it bears repeating because it’s
become so important. You need to have a simple, organized navigation bar that cus-
tomers use to find their way around your Web store. If a customer can’t find their
way around, they’ll leave and go to another Web store where it is easy to navigate.
While it takes a lot to impress your Web customers, it’s very easy to annoy them and
turn them away from you. Take a look at your navigation bar and ask yourself these
questions:

Are there too many options on the main navigation bar? You should
have an average of 4–6 options. If you have more and you should add sub-
navigation bars.

Does the navigation bar look the same on every page? It can shake a
user’s confidence if the order of options gets mixed around when they go
from section to section.

Can I tell from the navigation bar what section I’m in? Many Web sites
use a marker or a highlighted tab to indicate the section they’re currently
browsing.

Is it obvious what each link from the navigation bar represents? Your
users should be able to intuitively figure out where they’re going with each
click from the navigation bar. Use specific language and avoid any obscure
or “cute” references. If you survey your competition, you should see the
same option names used over and over.
Let Customers Get to the 
Merchandise Quickly
Believe it or not, some e-commerce store owners begin to “forget” their main pur-
pose is to sell things, because they start adding so much content and functionality
and get caught up in presenting that “cool stuff” to their customers. When someone
comes to your Web store, ask yourself this question: Can they access my product
catalog, buy something, and leave quickly? If you force them to go through several
screens before getting to your products, you’re slowing down a portion of your
buying public who wants to get at the goods fast. 
Try to remove any unneeded or extra Web pages or processes between your cus-
tomers and the ordering process. If someone uses your search box, make sure they
can order a product from the results page, not browse through summary statements
first. If you promote a product from your Web store home page, make sure they can

353
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Designing Your Web Store
click once to either read more about the product, or add it to their shopping cart.
Someone summed it up for me by offering a popular slogan — “Give the customer
what they want.” When it comes to e-commerce and convenience, what they want
are your products.
Offer a Smooth Checkout
It’s important to focus on the smooth checkout portion. Some Web store owners
think that, once someone adds a product to their shopping cart, that desire to get
the product will carry the customer through any process. Wrong. Make it too diffi-
cult to check out or place an order and that customer will take off, leaving behind
an abandoned shopping cart. There are entire books and studies that focus on the
abandoned shopping cart phenomenon and how to reduce that occurrence. The
easiest way is to make the checkout as smooth as possible: 

Don’t ask for every piece of information under the sun right away. Let
them check out with the minimum amount of information to process their
order. Later on, if you offer customer accounts, surveys, or feedback forms,
you can gather extra information, at the customer’s leisure. 

Break up the process into manageable steps. If you present one, long,
never-ending form for customers to complete, they may take one look and
say, “Forget it.” But ask them for their name and address first, then take
them to “Step 2” and get their Credit Card information, then go to “Step 3”
for anything else, and now it’s manageable. Show the number of steps and
the customer’s progression along the top of the screen.

Reuse information as much as possible. If you have to collect billing and
shipping information, offer an option where the customer can identify that
both are the same, so they don’t have to type in the same address twice. If
you know what state they’re in by asking them earlier, fill in that info on the
checkout screen. If the customer has an account on your Web store, fill in as
much information as possible when they go to check out again. 
Choose Your Colors Wisely
Believe it or not, the colors you use on your Web store speak volumes in the eyes of
your customers. Most importantly, the colors have to make the text readable on the
screen. If you put white or light colored characters on a black or dark background,
your customers can’t read anything. If the text and background colors clash, it is
very distracting for the customer to read the instructions or product descriptions. 
Load your Web store in any Web browser and go from top to bottom yourself. If pos-
sible, have other people read through your Web store and get their opinion, espe-
cially if you’re color blind and have trouble distinguishing different shades. Some
people recommend more muted colors that aren’t as harsh on the eye. Some users
are very specific — red text on a blue background is horrible, for example. 

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Optimize Your Pictures and Web Pages
Have you ever gone to a Web page where you can actually see the image being
drawn on the screen, line by line? It’s like getting put on hold, and most customers
will wait a maximum of 3–5 seconds before going on to the next Web site. You need
to make sure that your pictures and your Web pages load in a reasonable amount of
time. More specifically, the faster the page loads, the better.
When it comes to your pictures, make sure that you resize the pictures so they’re no
more than 600 by 800 pixels, on average. If you need to offer detailed pictures, then
use a thumbnail photo first, and allow the user to click on the thumbnail to bring up
a detailed version of the picture. Some people do the reverse of this rule, and only
offer the thumbnail version of the picture. That is a mistake as well — offer a low
resolution or thumbnail photo first, but make a bigger or more detailed picture one
click away.
When it comes to your Web pages, make sure that no additional code or functions
are sitting on each Web page. If you use an HTML editor like Microsoft Frontpage,
sometimes they include extra HTML commands and tags that aren’t necessary but
make the computer think more when drawing the page, and therefore slows down
the presentation of your Web store to your customers. If your pages are taking too
long to load (more than a few seconds), have someone who’s tech-savvy go through
your Web page source files and look for content that isn’t necessary.
Combine Text and Graphics 
to Convey Your Message
The power of the Internet today is the way you can combine text and graphics to tell
a richer story. It’s no longer a text-only world, but you don’t want to overwhelm your
users with too many pictures as well. Therefore, each Web page within your store
should be a careful mix of text and graphics to tell your story or convey your mes-
sage. If you can use a graphic to illustrate a process and save yourself a few para-
graphs of boring text, do so. Additionally, make sure the graphics have the
appropriate labels, so people don’t have to guess what the graphic represents.
If you find a Web page within your store that has way too much text, consider adding
some graphics to break up the text, act as category headers or text dividers, or pro-
vide a visual example to what the text is explaining. While a graphics-only Web store
may seem appealing because it seems language-independent, sometimes the graph-
ics may not load properly, and without text explanations, your customers are lost. 

355
Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Designing Your Web Store
Make Your Product Detail Pages 
Only about the Product
There are a lot of things you can do with your Web store, as I have mentioned in this
book. Some owners want every single Web page within their store to achieve as many
options as possible, and this thinking will overload your customers quickly. One
example is the product detail page. When a customer is looking at one specific prod-
uct and reading about the details or functionality, they don’t need to be bombarded
with quick links to the rest of your Web store, or inundated with too many cross-
selling or up-selling possibilities. They just want to read about that product and have
a clear option to either add the product to their cart or go back and browse.
In other words, there should be only one focus on the product detail page — the
product. Limit your cross-selling and up-selling to the checkout phase, or follow-up
e-mails. Let your navigation bar provide the options for your customer to see the
rest of the site, but don’t overwhelm each product detail page. This page should
only represent the product. 
Limit Your Use of Flash Animation
Ah, no Top 10 Web store design list is complete without this one. Several years ago,
Flash animation started popping up (pun intended) on all kinds of Web pages as Web
site owners wanted to impress their customers with the latest and greatest technol-
ogy. Flash technology is still being used today on the Internet, but it’s nowhere near
as abundant as it used to be, for several reasons:

It can be incredibly distracting for the customer

The load time of the Flash animation would slow down the Web site and
increase waiting time

The Flash animation would serve as an “Introduction screen” to the Web
site, further separating your customers from your products (which sepa-
rates you from potential sales)

It adds no value to the customer experience and actually makes your store
look less professional
Therefore, think long and hard about including any Flash animation on your Web
store pages. If you’ve got a content section to your store, or want to use a Flash ani-
mation as a how-to or helpful guide, that could work. The golden rule on Flash has
become this: When in doubt, don’t add Flash to your Web site.

Ten Traps to Avoid While Building
and Running Your Store
S
ometimes, the best advice you can give someone isn’t the specific steps to
take, but rather the specific steps not to make. In this final Top 10 list, I talk
about the mistakes and traps that Web store owners can fall into when they are
designing or maintaining their Web store. Like the other lists, many of these bullet
points came from Web store owners and customers who vented their frustration
and are pleading with you to heed this advice. Learn from the mistakes of others.
Overloading Your Home Page 
(or Any Other Page)
It’s one of the most common mistakes an ambitious Web store owner can make: You
work very hard to provide a robust e-commerce site, with lots of content, functional-
ity, and products to please even the most demanding or finicky customer. The trap is
feeling like the home page has to convey everything that the store has to offer. After
all, if it’s not mentioned or featured on the home page, how will the customer find it?
The result is that these owners pack all sorts of content, pictures, and links, onto the
home page, and the result is so thick with content that most customers give up and
never enter.
Your first goal is to make sure that all the vital information or links appear “above
the fold,” meaning that the first screen of information that someone sees, at the top
of your home page, has the vital links or info that any customer would need. This
screen becomes the focus for your customers, as most of them won’t take the time
to scroll down, regardless of whatever messages or prompts you give them.
Secondly, remember that you don’t have to display everything on the home page —
you can make secondary category pages or feature pages that point people to a
plethora of options. There’s only one page on your Web site that should mention
every single Web page you have, and that is the Site Map page. Make the most
important options visible on the home page, and make everything else one or two
clicks away. 

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Lastly, there is a hidden benefit from not overloading your Web pages, and that has
to do with the search engines. If there is too much information or too many links on
a page, the search engine can’t figure out what the most important thing is for each
page, and by definition, if everything is important, then nothing is important, and
nothing stands out. By limiting the message and options on each page, you focus
each page to communicate one or two messages, which improves your standing in
the search engines. 
Putting Too Much Animation on the Page
As the Internet and World Wide Web mature, Web site owners have an ever-changing
array of ways to capture people’s attention, from the simple blinking text and ani-
mated pictures, to full-blown Flash animation, audio, and video. Some Web site
owners think their Web page needs to be full of activity, so the user can’t help but
notice the Web page. The effect is that the user’s eyes get worn out and they have to
stare away from all that activity on the page. 
Therefore, if you plan on using any animation or moving imagery on your Web store,
think carefully and use it sparingly. If you want one item to be the focus of a particu-
lar Web page, then animating that one item is sufficient. If you want to give your cus-
tomers a splitting headache, then by all means, fill that Web page with dancing
babies and yellow smiley face icons.
Optimizing Your Store for One Web Browser
In their quest to get as many users browsing the Internet using their software only,
some Web browsers have built in special commands that work only for their soft-
ware. They offer Web site developers the chance for faster load times, advanced
functionality, and other perks for “optimizing” the Web site for a certain technology.
The risk of doing that is that your “optimized” Web store may not look right to cus-
tomers who use a competing Web browser.
Let’s face it, if customers don’t see your Web store properly, and perhaps certain
functions don’t even work on other Web browsers, they can’t shop with you. Do you
really want to turn away a potential section of your audience before they have a
chance to buy? Try using different Web browsers to place orders, and make sure
your Web site is available to anyone who wants to shop from you, regardless of the
technology they’re using.
Having Music Play Automatically 
on Any Visit
I remember the first time I went to the Monte Carlo Las Vegas Web site. As the fancy
home page was loading, suddenly I heard this music and wasn’t sure where it was
coming from. It took me a minute to realize that the music was coming out of my

359
Chapter 21: Ten Traps to Avoid While Building and Running Your Store
computer speakers and it was a part of the Monte Carlo Web site! Over the past few
years, Web site owners have added music as a way to distinguish themselves from
the competition, in hopes that a soothing classical tune will improve the customers’
state of mind and increase their enjoyment of the Web site.
Sadly, this technique has backfired on a lot of Web site owners, especially those who
don’t make it clear how to turn off the music. Many customers now use work time to
browse the Web, and nothing tips off a boss more than music suddenly emanating
from Mr. Smith’s cubicle. Even if your Web site sells music, you shouldn’t automati-
cally have the music load and play when someone comes to visit, but rather offer
the music as a link someone can click on if they choose to listen.
Mixing Personal Opinion with Your Business
For many entrepreneurs their store is their livelihood, and they see their store as a
way to do good and promote their own personal beliefs. The trap is assuming that
your customer’s beliefs are the same as yours, and that your beliefs cannot offend
anyone else. The truth is that your customers have a wide range of beliefs, ideolo-
gies, and customs, and they’re shopping from you because you offer a good product
or excellent customer service, not because you have the same affiliations.
Accepting Only One Payment Method
Customers love the Internet because of the convenience offered, and credit cards
make the ordering process much more convenient than other payment methods.
However, it doesn’t mean that 100 percent of your customers will have an available
credit card and feel comfortable giving it to a complete stranger. Heck, there’s not
even one dominant credit card out there. It’s never “Visa?” or “Mastercard?” but
rather “Visa or Mastercard?” And then there’s American Express, Diner’s Club,
Discover, Carte Blanche, other credit cards, PayPal, checks, money orders, wire
transfers, and so on. Are you going to limit your customer base to only one payment
method? 
Even if 90 percent of your customers use the one payment method you offer, you’re
instantly losing 10 percent of your potential customer base. As a new Web store owner,
you can’t afford to isolate a chunk of your audience if you can help it. Just as cus-
tomers want selection of products, they want a choice in payment methods too, if for
no reason other than it signals flexibility and concern for the customer experience.
Forcing Your Customers to Register
Before They Shop
Years ago, I walked into a Radio Shack and asked the clerk how much a pack of bat-
teries cost, only to get the question, “Uh, what’s your zip code?” Zip code? What
does that have to do with the cost of batteries? I ended up storming out and going
somewhere else. Some Web stores are set up where the customer has to register, put

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
in all their information, and in some cases, create a customer account first before
they’re allowed to add items to a shopping cart or check out. In some cases, the cus-
tomer can’t see the total price, including shipping and handling, until they add the
item to the cart and register for an account.
In most cases, making it that difficult to proceed will result in lots of abandoned
shopping carts. Let the customer browse as much as possible, give as much informa-
tion as possible before they place their order, and make it as easy as possible to
place an order first. Your “customer” isn’t even a customer until they have con-
sciously decided to pay for a certain basket of items and check out. Once they have
made that decision, then you can start asking them questions and encouraging them
to sign up for a customer account. Get them comfortable about the product and
your prices first, then get their information.
Forgetting to Consistently Refresh Your
Content or Store Look
You’ve gone through all the steps, you’ve double-checked all your Web pages, and
you’ve uploaded everything to the Internet. Whew, you’re done! Well, not exactly. As
your customers decide whether to place repeat orders with you, they’ll come back
to your Web site on a regular or irregular basis. While it’s important to be consistent,
if your customers see the same Web pages, with the same color scheme and layout,
month after month, year after year, they begin to wonder if anybody is actually
“minding the store” or someone built the store and walked away.
If you’ve used any of the big Internet retailers, like Amazon, eBay, or Overstock.com,
you’ll notice that, on average, every 12 to 18 months they unveil an almost com-
pletely different look to keep up with the times and tastes of the Internet, and in
smaller intervals, unveil updates or slight changes to their page. This makes the
business seem fresh and current, as customers are craving to do business with
stores that will keep up with their needs and wants.
You should reserve a big re-design of your Web site for an anniversary or special
product launch, but every few months, consider changing a small element of your
Web site. Perhaps you roll out a new color scheme after 6 or 12 months. Definitely
change any promotion boxes or announcements on your home page after a set
period of time. Of course, whenever you make any changes, make sure every page is
still consistent. Otherwise, you end up with a jumble of different designs after a year,
and that conveys an unstable, unprofessional, unprofitable store.
Letting Discussions or Questions 
Go Unanswered
Your Web site look and feel isn’t the only thing that should be touched up or refreshed
as time goes on. Many Web store owners add a discussion board or chat room to their
Web store, or implement comments on their blog section. But then they forget to go

Chapter 21: Ten Traps to Avoid While Building and Running Your Store
back in regular intervals, read what customers or visitors have written, and respond
to any open questions. The quickest way to show your customers that you don’t care
about them is to ignore their questions and pleas for help. Answer any posted ques-
tions as soon as possible. Even if one customer answered another customer, post a
reply and give additional information, even if it’s to say, “Yep, Jeff is right, that’s how
we do business. Thanks for your question.”
Along the same note, if you provide an area for discussion, don’t assume that “if you
build it, they will come.” You’ll need to start the conversation, and in the beginning,
perhaps have a discussion with yourself by posting multiple times, and encouraging
others to take part in the discussion. Stop in on regular intervals, add any postings
or announcements to show everyone that new content will be available there, and
perhaps design a promotion to encourage usage of this area. If you add this function-
ality to your Web store, factor in some time for you (or an employee) to manage this
area, as it won’t manage itself effectively.
Neglecting to Test or Optimize 
Your Web Page Load Times
You’ve tested your Web store for accuracy, for functionality, and for completeness.
Every link works, every function works, every page has the same navigation bar. You
post your Web store and get to work fulfilling orders. But there’s one thing you neg-
lect to test for — how quickly the Web store loads in the Web browser. Typically,
it will load fast for you because you’re developing the site, so perhaps the graphics
are locally stored, requiring less load time. If you have a fast connection or are work-
ing directly on your storefront provider’s account, then the store will load quickly
for you.
The test comes by going to someone else’s computer and loading your Web store on
their system. Make a note of the first time it loads on their screen, and if any elements
load slower than the rest, like a picture that is drawing itself one line at a time on the
screen. While lots of people now have a fast connection into their home, not every-
one does, so if possible, test your Web store on someone’s computer that has a dial-
up connection to the Internet. Hopefully you’ve designed your Web pages to load as
quickly as possible, but you should check for it at some point just to be sure.
