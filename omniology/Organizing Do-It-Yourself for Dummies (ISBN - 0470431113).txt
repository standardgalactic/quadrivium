Organizing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Introduction
B
ack in the day, it wasn’t that challenging to maintain a tidy household because
frankly, people didn’t have many belongings. Your bow goes here, your arrow
goes there, and you’re already wearing your loincloth. Well, times have changed! We
live in a consumer-based economy, meaning that clothing and products are more
affordable than in past generations and, as a result, we have a lot of stuff! Enter the
need for home organization.
Simply put, home organization is the process of putting away one’s belongings. Is it
an art or a science? Definitely both! Organization appeals to left-brained people
because it’s logical and systematic. But the creativity involved in selecting how to
group things is fascinating to right-brained people. Scientists will marvel over an
office’s worth of items being condensed into a desk with a hutch, and artists will
enjoy the satisfaction of finding just the right floral file to hold the tax returns.
There’s something in home organization for everyone!
Is organizing a lot of work? Probably less than you think. The process I describe in
this book is very systematic and easy to follow. Basically, you assess the contents of
the room, decide what items will stay and what items will go, and find the best way
to display or store the items that you’re keeping.
The hard work is definitely worth it. An organized home has so many benefits; imme-
diately, you’ll notice that you’re saving valuable minutes because you aren’t spend-
ing any time searching for missing items. With time, you’ll see that you spend less
money because you aren’t repurchasing items that you already have. Best of all,
your home will be a relaxing sanctuary that your family looks forward to returning to
at the end of the day. If you’re ready to create an orderly living space, Organizing Do-
It-Yourself For Dummies is the book for you.
About This Book
My world of organization is inspired by a quote from the father of invention,
Benjamin Franklin: “A place for everything and everything in its place.” This quote
conjures up an image of a home free of clutter and probably makes you think “I want
that!” The goal of this book is to help you create harmony and order in your home
through easy-to-apply organization techniques and do-it-yourself projects. This book
gives you everything you need to tackle your house in a systematic, room-by-room
method. Nothing in this book is too advanced for the average homeowner; as soon
as you know how to find a wall stud and use a level, you’re well on your way.
I present you with a straightforward, five-step organization plan that provides the
framework necessary to transform an entire room. In those five steps, I guide you
through the process of evaluating the goals of the room, identifying the limitations of

2
Organizing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
the room, emptying the space and sorting, putting together projects, and reassem-
bling the room. You’re encouraged to make some tough decisions to achieve your
organized home, but the result will be worth it!
While the five-step plan is the road map to get the job done, my four organization
philosophies are the motivation to help keep you on track. My organization 
philosophies fall into four categories: be disciplined, be green, be frugal, and be
clever. Organizing a room using the steps and philosophies helps you build your 
do-it-yourself confidence.
With the five-step plan and four organization philosophies in mind, I devote a chap-
ter to organizing each room in your house, from the primary “work horses” of your
home — entryway/living room, kitchen, bedroom/closet, bathroom, and home
office — to the secondary areas of your home — kids’ spaces, laundry room, and
garage. In each of these chapters, I provide step-by-step directions on a wide vari-
ety of organizational projects, accompanied by full-color photos. Don’t forget about
the details — in each chapter, I also outline decorative finishing touches that help
make your house a home. You can pick and choose the rooms you want to work on,
but if you need to bring order to every part of your home, I have you covered.
Conventions Used in This Book
I include the following conventions to help you navigate this book:

New terms appear in italics and are accompanied by definitions.

All Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.

Keywords in bulleted lists appear in boldface.

I include extra tips and other interesting information in shaded sidebars.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you, dear reader:

You want to be able to wake up in the morning to a peaceful bedroom
retreat free of clutter.

You want your clothing to fit in your closets and those closets to be organ-
ized by color and type so finding the right outfit is simple and free of 
frustration.

You want to be able to cook dinner in a kitchen with streamlined cabinets
and drawers and easily accessible food and appliances.

You want to be able to easily pay your bills from your home office, quickly
file documents, and locate necessary information.

You want all of your living spaces to feel restful and clear of clutter.

How This Book Is Organized
Organizing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies is divided into four parts that deal with the
preparation, execution, and finishing touches of organizing your home.
Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects
What do you need to do before you get started? Begin by preparing yourself for the
process both mentally and physically. By this, I mean read up on the overall process
and collect all the stuff you need before you tackle a room. Great results are the
byproduct of preparation, inspiration, and perspiration!
In Chapter 1, I introduce the five-step plan and four organization philosophies. They
work together to motivate and guide you through all aspects of a room organization.
Refer to Chapter 1 before you work on a room to get your organizational juices flow-
ing! In Chapter 2, I present the tools necessary to complete a room; home organiza-
tion relies on sorting tools, installation tools, and finishing tools. This chapter also
sets time frames and expectations for your projects. By my estimate, you can trans-
form any room in your house in fewer than 24 work-hours. Now that’s motivating! In
Chapter 3, I review basic carpentry terms and techniques. If I ask you to use your
carpenter’s square to make sure your shelf is perpendicular to the stud, knowing
exactly what I’m talking about is a good idea! I also include a list of helpful frequently
asked carpentry questions. Whether carpentry is brand new or old hat, I recom-
mend reading up before starting any projects.
Part II: Organizing Primary 
Spaces in Your Home
How can you make your life easier? By organizing the primary spaces in your home!
In this part, I provide projects for the entryway, living room, kitchen, bedroom, clos-
ets, bathroom, and home office. Take a moment to assess your biggest frustration
and start in that area. If it’s challenging to get dressed in the morning, begin with
your bedroom closet. If the bills aren’t getting paid on time, begin with the home
office. If you’re too frustrated to cook dinner, begin in the kitchen. Take control of
your household one room at a time.
Part III: Organizing Secondary 
Spaces in Your Home
Secondary spaces are areas that are important to your day but aren’t necessarily
large living spaces. Part III provides both conventional and out-of-the-box storage
ideas for your kids’ spaces, laundry room, and garage. Organizing these three spaces
will keep your household running like a well-oiled machine!
3
Introduction

Part IV: The Part of Tens
A few common threads are woven into the fabric of American households: not
enough time, not enough space, and needing more help! Life is busy, and you have
things to do. Use the tips in this part to help your household run smoothly and 
save time.
Icons Used in This Book
When I have something particularly important to say in this book, I want it to jump
out at you! Keep your eyes open for these icons throughout the book. They give you
a heads up for potential mental notes, tips, and project pitfalls.
This icon points to important information that you should take away from this book.
This icon highlights pieces of time- and hassle-saving information.
This icon alerts you to organization pitfalls. Beware!
Where to Go from Here
This book is designed to be read from cover to cover (hint, hint), but feel free to
jump right into any part or chapter depending on your needs.
Part I gives you a feel for what you need to do to prepare for a project. If you’re a
true organizing novice, start with this part.
Are you ready to tackle specific areas of your home? Parts II and III are where you
dive into projects — organizing primary and secondary spaces of your house. When
you get a few of these under your belt, you’ll start to notice subtle changes in your
household . . . piles of clutter have disappeared, you seem to have more leisure time,
and your household feels more at peace.
If you want some easy tips and tricks to put into action right now, employ the tech-
niques in Part IV to help your family life and your household run smoother.

Organizing Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Part I
Preparing for Your
Organizing Projects

In this part . . .
You’re excited by the prospect of a clutter-free home
and ready to jump into organizing a specific space,
such as your kitchen or garage. Maybe you’ve been living
with clutter for years and can’t take it another day! While 
I applaud your enthusiasm, I strongly encourage you to
read this part to find out the basics before diving into a
project. Proper preparation will save you time in the long
run — and you can still get started today!
In this part, I walk you through a five-step plan for 
organizing a room and present you with practical organiza-
tional philosophies. Mantras like “One in, one out” and
“Less is more” provide inspiration as well as keep you 
on track during your room organizations. I also help you
identify and collect your sorting, installation, and finishing
tools and plan your time. Lastly, I help you brush up on
your carpentry knowledge. Do you remember how to
locate wall studs or ceiling joists? If you don’t, I help 
you figure it out!

Chapter 1
The Principles of Do-It-Yourself
Organization
In This Chapter
 Following five simple steps to an organized room
 Adhering to four organization philosophies
T
he fact that you’re reading this book signals that you’re serious about organizing
your home. Congratulations! There are so many perks to having an organized
home — your bills get paid on time, meals are cooked quickly, and you can find your
child’s sleeping bag in a snap. An organized home is a direct path to an organized life!
This chapter boils down my approach to tackling a house, one room at a time. With
the five-step plan, I hold your hand throughout the process — setting goals, assess-
ing limitations, emptying and sorting, enhancing the room with projects, and
reassembling the room. In addition, I present several organization philosophies to
motivate and inspire you.
Five Steps to an Organized Room
Are you ready to get serious about organization? The following steps guide you
through the process from beginning to end. In the long run, it saves time to
approach each room with a plan. (Chapter 2 outlines an organization schedule.)
Step 1: Determine the goal of the room
You may already have a firm vision for your space. Perhaps it’s from a friend’s home,
a TV show, or a magazine spread. Or maybe you’re so frustrated by the current state
of your room that you can’t see the forest for the trees. In either case, I recommend
spending a little time sitting in your space, assessing what you like and don’t like,
and envisioning the way you want it to feel — and function!
The goal for your space should be specific, concrete, and directly related to the
function of your space. For example, the goal for your home office may be a place to
manage paperwork, a desktop on which to write letters, or a space to manage your
thriving home business. If you still aren’t clear on your vision, make a list of exactly
what you need to accomplish in your space, and develop this into your goal. For
inspiration, search spaces online or in magazines until one jumps out at you.

8
Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects 
Step 2: Identify the limitations of the room
Is your goal realistic? To determine the answer to this all-important question, factor
in limitations such as size, layout, and requirements of the room. For example, the
goal of your living room may be a welcoming space for entertaining guests. The limi-
tations of the space may be its small size, lack of entryway, and the reality that it’s the
only room in the house for the home office. The fusion of the goal and its limitations
is a living room with an entryway table for guests, a single sofa with an ottoman/
coffee table to provide additional seating, and a discreet office nook.
Step 3: Sort the room
After you set a realistic goal for your room with the room’s limitations in mind, you
can empty out your room. This process is vital for organizing a space because it
allows you to assess the storage needs for the items that will stay in the room.
Sort items into four large bins as follows (Chapter 2 has the details on tools):

STAY: The items in this bin are in good condition, are used often, are rele-
vant to the room’s goal, and will stay in the room.

MOVE: The items in this bin are in good condition and used often, but they
don’t belong in the room you’re organizing (as related to the room’s goal).

SHARE: The items in this bin are in good condition but haven’t been used in
the last year, are duplicates of other items, or no longer serve the room’s goal.

GO: The items in this bin are trash — simple as that!
After the contents of your room are sorted, transfer all your MOVE items to their
proper places in your home, place your SHARE items in your garage to donate at a
later time, and throw away your GO items. Review your STAY items to make sure
they really do support the goal of your room. 
Step 4: Build and install your projects
Pat yourself on the back: After emptying and sorting the contents of your room, you
now have an empty space! If you plan to paint your space, this is the opportune time
because the area is cleared out and wall-mounted projects haven’t been installed.
Each chapter in Parts II and III is devoted to organizing an entire room. Read up on
your specific room and decide which projects are appropriate for your space. Most
projects take about an hour and can be installed with a level, screwdriver, and elec-
tric drill. Some of the more advanced projects take several hours and require the use
of a nail gun, carpenter’s square, or ladder. (Turn to Chapter 2 for the scoop on
installation tools; Chapter 3 provides details on carpentry basics.)
Step 5: Reassemble the room
Now the fun can begin! Your newly organized space will have more storage options
and far fewer items. How ever did you manage before? Reinforce your commitment

to an organized space by putting like items in a single container and labeling it. Add
decorative accessories and a touch of whimsy to every room. I can’t help but smile
while I walk through my front door in July and see my Buddha statue wearing sun-
glasses. Then fall rolls around, and Buddha is wearing a scarf!
All the chapters in Parts II and III include inspirational ideas for reassembling a given
room; be sure to check them out. Chapter 2 has a list of helpful finishing tools.
Four Organization Philosophies to Embrace
My organization philosophies in this section are meant to add dimension to the
steps you execute when organizing a room. Familiarize yourself with these concepts;
if you ever find yourself off-track when you’re organizing a room, return to them to
refocus your efforts.
Be disciplined
Life runs so much smoother when the members of your household know where to
find items and where to return them after use. Drive this point home by sticking to
clever systems, locating like items together and putting items away after each use.
Here are some suggestions for keeping to a relatively disciplined organization routine:

Set up systems around your home. Personally, I couldn’t run my household
without a to-do box and a donate box. Even my kids are onboard! When
they’ve outgrown an item of clothing or toy, they add it to the donate box.
When you get a phone call from a charity soliciting donations, say “Yes!”
and relish in the fact that your donations are packed and ready to go.

Use baskets, bins, and boxes. Group like items together, find an appropriate
home for them, and label it. Resist the urge to just stuff items in drawers or
cabinets. Taking one minute to put items away properly saves many min-
utes of future frustration associated with trying to find them!

Relax — everyone is allowed to have a junk drawer. There’s probably a
drawer in your home that’s a constant problem. Nothing in this drawer
seems to fit into the other categories, making it an endless source of frustra-
tion. Decide to let that drawer be a junk drawer, and move on. Heck, even
label it “Junk” if it makes you feel better. As this drawer fills up, weed out
the trash, but don’t try to make more sense of it. Just be sure to discipline
yourself to limit this affliction to a single drawer!
Be green
Reduce, reuse, and recycle! Buy locally. Act globally. Help your neighbor. You’re
familiar with the earth-friendly catchphrases of the 21st century, but are you living
them? Follow these guidelines for keeping your organizational efforts green:

Make green decisions. You have a choice in every item you purchase or
donate. Be green by reducing your purchases, reusing containers you have
on hand, and recycling everything you can. If you can, borrow an item
instead of buying it.
9
Chapter 1: The Principles of Do-It-Yourself Organization


Act locally. Donate gently used items to local women’s shelters, charities,
and schools. Use your purchasing power to support local businesses and
help your chosen neighborhood flourish. A community is built from within,
so do your part!
Be frugal
Once it’s organized, the best way to maintain your space is to reduce the influx of
items coming in. When you’re about to buy an item, ask yourself this series of ques-
tions: “Do I need it?,” “Can I afford it?,” “Can I borrow it from someone else?,” “Can I
get it secondhand?,” and “Can I store it?” You may be surprised by your answers!
When you do purchase a new item, follow the sage advice of “one in, one out”: If you
buy that new sweater, prepare to get rid of an old one.
Here are a few additional ideas for embracing your frugal side:

Repurpose items. I’m a firm believer in the fact that you can accomplish a
lot of organization without spending money. Cardboard boxes and old jars
are far better organizational devices than piles of stuff on the floor. Consider
turning an old door into a desk, repurposing an unused wine rack as a maga-
zine holder, or transforming an old shower rod into a clothing bar.

Stop paying for storage. If you’re currently paying for offsite storage, I
encourage you to give your 30-day notice. Employing the tips in this book
will help you weed through the items in storage and determine if they sup-
port the goal for your home. Donating or selling unnecessary items from
storage will make you feel better, and the money you save from eliminating
this fee goes straight to your bottom line!

Regift. You’re bound to come across unopened items when sorting through
a room. Return things for which you have the receipt, and regift whatever
else you can (gifts that were nice but not to your taste, for example).
Be clever
When you see a chance to make life easier, go for it! In general, start with less stuff to
manage and fewer things to do, and you’ll soon find that you have fewer frustrations
in life. Remember, when it comes to stuff, less is more! Consider these guidelines:

Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. There’s a reason that home
organization stores, magazines, and TV shows are so inspirational — they
display the work of professionals! If you see an idea you love, copy it!

Less is more. Purchase toys that don’t require batteries, which need fre-
quent changing. Cancel subscriptions for magazines you don’t have time to
read. Get rid of items you use less than once a year and struggle to store.
Small changes like these add up and result in more time, less frustration,
and fewer items on your to-do list!

Embrace technology. Store your DVDs and CDs in media folders. Upload
your CDs to your hard drive. Scan your photos onto your computer.
Embrace technology whenever you can, but don’t forget to back up your
hard drive regularly.

The Tools and Time You Need
In This Chapter
 Collecting your organizing tools
 Determining the amount of time you need per project
T
ell your personal trainer you’re taking some time off — because home organi-
zation is an excellent workout! Expect to work up a sweat by sorting items,
installing projects, and putting the finishing touches on rooms in your home. This
chapter provides you with detailed information on the tools needed to whip your
house into shape. They’re divided into three categories: sorting tools, installation
tools, and finishing tools. Additionally, I fill you in on the details of my handy do-it-
yourself kit, which is a great stocked caddy to carry room to room when organizing.
(Flip to Chapter 3 for specifics on using all these tools.)
In this chapter, I also help you develop a time frame for organizing rooms. This esti-
mate includes planning and sorting time as well as time for shopping, installing proj-
ects, and reassembling a room. You’ll want to give your personal trainer an estimate
of when you’ll be back to the gym, right?
Gathering Your Tools
Save valuable running around time by gathering the tools in the following sections
before you start a project. When you’re inspired and on a roll, you don’t want to
break your momentum and run to the hardware store to buy a plastic bin or a level.
Sorting tools
Roll up your sleeves and get to it! The easiest way to make sense of a room is to
remove all the stuff, sort it, and put it all back in a logical manner (see Chapter 1 for
an introduction to sorting). Sorting is a fast-paced task, and you can stay on top of
the game by having a supply of simple sorting tools on hand (see Figure 2-1). You’ll
use these items for tackling each room:

Bins: Use large, sturdy plastic containers. I recommend getting high-quality
jumbo bins (at least 65 gallons) because they need to hold a lot of weight!

12
Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects 

Neon construction paper and markers: Purchase paper in four different
colors (like neon yellow, green, orange, and pink) to correspond to the four
sorting categories. Label the signs with large block letters: STAY, MOVE,
SHARE, and GO. When you’re working quickly and efficiently, a large, clearly
marked sign catches your eye and helps you hit the right target from 20 feet
across the room. (You want your old shoe to end up in SHARE, not STAY!)

Trash bags: When you find your sorting groove, your bins are likely to fill up
fast. Have a supply of sturdy large trash bags on hand to periodically empty
out your SHARE and GO bins in particular. Label your trash bags (so your
SHARE pile doesn’t end up in the trash), and get back to sorting!
Figure 2-1: An assortment of sorting tools.
Installation tools
The projects in this book are simple, straightforward, and use many of the same
tools again and again. For example, in almost every project, you need a pencil, stud
finder, screwdriver, and level. You probably already have them in your garage! Some
of the more advanced installations require a nail gun and carpenter’s square, and —
don’t be intimidated — you may have to work from the top of a ladder. Here are the
most commonly used installation tools in this book (see Figure 2-2):

Everyday tools: Phillips screwdriver, flathead screwdriver, hammer, and
pencil

Power tools: Drill, drill bits, nail gun, and safety goggles

Carpentry items: Level, carpenter’s square, measuring tape, ladder, stud
finder, nails, screws, and drywall anchors
Don’t forget painting supplies! You’ve decluttered your space and have a plan for
projects and furniture rearrangements, but something still isn’t right! Before you
return all your STAY items to a room, celebrate your newly organized space with a
coat (or two) of paint in a new color. Try zesty red, fuchsia, or turquoise for an ener-
gizing effect; aqua, sage, or gray for a calming effect; or cream, navy, or beige for a
traditional feel. You’ve earned it!

Figure 2-2: Tools for installing projects.
Finishing tools
A room isn’t complete until it’s finished. By this, I mean that all items should be put
away in containers, clearly labeled and artfully arranged, and all your furniture and
accessories should be back in place. If you like the way the revamped room looks,
you’re more likely to maintain your organized space going forward. Here are a few
helpful items for finishing a room (see Figure 2-3):

Bins, baskets, and boxes: Good job on the sorting . . . now put it all away.
Review your collection of STAY items and decide on the best container for
them. A bin? A basket? A box? Select a container with features that make
sense for your items. Do you want something with an open top or closed?
Clear, opaque, woven, leather, or plastic? The choice is yours!
In Parts II and III, I provide suggestions for containers and other gadgets
geared toward specific rooms. Be sure to check them out.

Label maker: Reinforce your hard work by labeling your bins, baskets, and
boxes. The visual cues will help you commit to your organized space, and
others will follow your lead. I find it really hard to put a box of pasta on a
shelf labeled “Canned foods,” don’t you?

Scented candles or scent diffusers: The final layer of a complete room is
scent. (I’m a huge fan of peppermint and lavender.) Scent can totally trans-
form your mood. Try it!
Your own do-it-yourself kit
Are you committed to organizing your bedroom? Your whole home? Your workplace?
If you see do-it-yourself organizing in your future, treat yourself to a kit that holds
your tools and sources of inspiration. Think of it as your briefcase!
13
Chapter 2: The Tools and Time You Need

Figure 2-3: A few finishing touches for an organized room.
Select a box that’s sturdy, roomy, and easy to carry around. I recommend a size
somewhere between a makeup case and a standard toolbox. Fill your do-it-yourself
kit with the following items (see Figure 2-4):

Tools: Label maker, labels, screwdrivers, screws, small hammer, nails, stud
finder, small level, measuring tape, pencil, marker, and a small pad of paper

Inspiration: Color wheel, paint swatches, inspirational photos from maga-
zines, and home organization catalogs
I store my do-it-yourself kit in my office because it’s centrally located in my home. If
I’m inspired by a project or tip I see online or in a magazine, I can just grab my kit
and take it with me room to room. Given that the kit is visible in the room, I wanted
to select a box that’s attractive and coordinates with the décor of my home office.
My kit is silver; what color inspires you?

Estimating Your Organizing Time
This book arms you with inspirational tips and clever projects. As you read through
them, I expect the little voice in the back of your head to chime in, saying “How long
is this going to take?” Whether you do only one project in a room or organize an
entire room from scratch, you need to develop a game plan for what you want to do
in the space, sorting the contents, shopping for supplies, putting together the proj-
ects, and reassembling the space. In the following sections, I break down the amount
of time you need to organize a room and provide an easy plan for a weekend session.
Each project in this book has an accompanying time frame, such as “less than an
hour” or “less than half a day,” so you have a good idea of how long it takes to finish
a particular project.
Breaking down the amount of time
needed to organize an entire room
You may look at Parts II and III and choose only a handful of projects for a room,
but what if you want to overhaul an entire space? The following guidelines give you
an idea of how many work hours you may need to organize different size spaces
from start to finish. Keep in mind this is just an estimate and everyone works at his
or her own pace!

Large space room organization: Kitchen (Chapter 5), bedroom/closet
(Chapter 6), home office (Chapter 8), or garage (Chapter 11)
• Breakdown: Planning (1–2 hours), sorting (2–3 hours), shopping 
(1–2 hours), building projects (2–4 hours), and reassembling the room
(2–4 hours)
• Total: Up to 15 hours (allow 20 if you plan to paint)

Medium space room organization: Entryway/living room (Chapter 4) or
kids’ space (Chapter 9)
• Breakdown: Planning (0–1 hour), sorting (1–2 hours), shopping 
(1–2 hours), building projects (1–3 hours), and reassembling the room 
(1–2 hours)
• Total: Up to 10 hours (allow 15 if you plan to paint)

Small space room organization: Bathroom (Chapter 7) or laundry (Chapter 10)
• Breakdown: Planning (0–1 hour), sorting (0–1 hour), shopping (1–2 hours),
building projects (1–2 hours), and reassembling the room (0–1 hour)
• Total: Up to 7 hours (allow 12 if you plan to paint)
The preceding list illustrates that with a little hard work and caffeine, you can trans-
form any room in your house in under 24 work hours.

Chapter 2: The Tools and Time You Need

Outlining a plan for weekend warriors
If your daily routine involves working 9 to 5 (or similar hours), the weekend is probably
the best time for you to tackle projects. By planning ahead and sticking to the following
schedule, you can complete an entire room in a weekend!
1. During the week
Read the appropriate chapter of this book, and ponder what projects are right
for your space. Cancel any weekend engagements so that you can work unin-
terrupted and without distractions.
2. Friday evening
Unplug your telephone. Grab a buddy, and empty the entire contents of the room,
sorting as you go into bins labeled STAY, MOVE, SHARE, and GO. Play upbeat
music and sip caffeinated beverages to make the process go faster! (1–4 hours)
Review the STAY box to determine what will stay in the room, and fine-tune the
projects you plan to build or install. Record any measurements necessary to
build your projects, such as the height of your pantry, the amount of space
available inside a kitchen cabinet, or the dimensions of your closet. (1–2 hours)
Compile your shopping list, which should include tools, materials, paint,
lumber, and so on. Double-check your measurements and project list to be
sure that you get the right items in the correct sizes on your first shopping
trip! (30 minutes)
Get a good night’s sleep!
3. Saturday
Early morning: Prep your walls, and apply the first coat of paint. (1–2 hours)
Late morning: While the first coat of paint dries, hit the home improvement
store to buy all the items on your list. (2 hours)
Midday: Return home and get started on building and installing your projects.
Install anything that doesn’t interfere with painting the walls, such as closet
organizers. (4 hours)
Late afternoon: Add the second coat of paint (1–2 hours) before you hit the sack.
If you don’t plan to paint the room, you can start grouping like items in con-
tainers and labeling them. If your adrenaline is still pumping, you can bag up
all the items you plan to donate and move them to your garage. Don’t forget to
itemize donations for your tax write-off!
4. Sunday
In the morning, move your furniture back into the room and fine-tune your fur-
niture arrangement. Install any remaining projects. (1–2 hours)
Return your STAY items to the room, methodically selecting the proper bin,
basket, or box to contain everything, labeling them, and artfully arranging
them. (2–4 hours)
Approaching a room organization project with the help of a team is a great way to show-
case every member’s strengths! Develop a firm game plan in which everyone has a job.
For example, your energetic teen can empty the room while your spouse applies a new
coat of paint, your contractor neighbor gets to work installing a wall cabinet, and you
shop for bins, baskets, and boxes. Just make sure your team has a captain, and everyone
knows who it is . . . a clipboard and a megaphone should do the trick.

Nailing Down Carpentry Fundamentals
In This Chapter
 Understanding basic carpentry techniques
 Answering frequently asked carpentry questions
H
ome organization involves lots of emptying and sorting because you have to
pare down the contents of a space before you can reassemble your room.
After you empty and sort a room, the real fun begins — building projects! This
chapter familiarizes you with basic carpentry techniques and frequently asked
questions. There’s no need to be intimidated by carpentry; all the projects in this
book are simple enough for the average homeowner to complete.
Hammering Out Basic
Carpentry Techniques
Quality techniques ensure quality finished products. Just about every project in this
book instructs you to measure dimensions, locate a wall stud or ceiling joist, and use
tools. This section provides specific instructions on these basic carpentry techniques.
Measuring length, width, and height
Accurate projects begin with accurate measurements, hence the expression “meas-
ure twice, cut once.” This approach works infinitely better than measuring, cutting,
repurchasing the item, measuring again, and cutting again.
Measurements are usually taken and listed in order of length, width, and then height.
If you’re not sure which measurement is length and which is width, length is the
longer of the two (if there’s a difference). Height references how tall an item is, and
depth also may be used in place of width, depending on what you’re measuring.
When taking any measurement, measure the distance in at least three places and use
the smallest number. For example, measure the width of a wall nook along the back
wall, halfway between the back wall and the opening, and at the edge of the opening.
Use the smallest number as your final width measurement to make sure that what-
ever you’re planning to put in the nook will fit properly.

Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects 
Locating a wall stud or ceiling joist
The walls of most homes consist of sheets of drywall nailed or screwed into vertical
wood framing. Studs are the vertical, 11⁄2-inch thick 2-x-4-inch pieces of wood framing.
Studs are generally located every 16 inches, and you have to find and use them
when hanging heavy items on the wall. Installing heavy items in drywall only is
unsafe, even if you use drywall anchors (see the later section “When do you use 
drywall anchors?”). Ceiling joists are the same as wall studs except that they run
across the ceiling instead of vertically down the walls.
You can go about locating a wall stud or a ceiling joist in one of several ways (if
you’re looking for a joist, grab a ladder!).

The right tool for the job: A stud finder detects the nails or screws used to
attach drywall to studs. Just hold the finder to the wall or ceiling and run it
slowly along the length of the wall or across the ceiling; when the device
detects a nail or screw — and therefore the stud — it beeps or lights up.

The good old knocking method: Hollow walls sound very different from
dense wood. Walk along a wall and knock the wall with your knuckles as you
go. The hollow (drywall) portion will sound very flat, and the stud (wood)
portion will sound very sharp.

The outlet technique: Wall outlets are installed in wall studs, so you can
assume that there’s a wall stud within 1 inch or so of every wall outlet. Use
your stud finder or trusty knuckle to verify.

The magnet test: If you’re leery of the results of your stud finder or knuck-
les, you can find a stud with a magnet. Select the wall area where you intend
to hang your item and slowly move a magnet in a snaking pattern along this
wall. When your magnet crosses a nail or screw in the drywall and stud, it
sticks to the metal, and you know you’ve found a stud!
Using a level
A level, also called a carpenter’s level, spirit level, or bubble level, indicates whether
marks or an installation are perfectly level (horizontal) or plumb (vertical). The level
is a rectangular device with a number of glass tubes each containing liquid with an
air bubble. If you hold the level against the object you’re checking and the bubble is
centered within its marked guide on the glass tube, the object is level or plumb; if
the bubble is off to one side, you need to readjust the item and check for level or
plumb again.
Using a square
A square, also called a carpenter’s square or a framing square, indicates whether an
installation is at a perfect right angle (90-degree angle). The square has one long
arm and one short arm and is made of aluminum or steel. A square can determine
in a single measurement if two items are at a right angle, whereas using a level for
that purpose requires a series of horizontal and vertical measurements. To check a
right angle, position one end of the square along the adjacent wall or ceiling and the
other along the item that you’re hanging (see Figure 3-1).

Figure 3-1: A square checks that items (such as holes for drilling) 
are at a right angle to an adjacent wall, surface, or straight edge.
You also can use a square to establish that two items, like shelves, are parallel. To do
so, place one end of the square along the vertical edge of one shelf and the other
end of the square along the horizontal edge of a second object.
Using a screwdriver
The two main types of screwdrivers are Phillips and flathead:

Phillips screwdrivers install screws with an X on the head. Most manufac-
tured products — like message boards, medicine cabinets, and floating
shelving — include mounting hardware with these types of screws. Phillips
screwdrivers allow the user to get a two-way grip between the screwdriver
and the screw and install the item without any side-to-side slipping.

Flathead screwdrivers install screws with a straight slot on the head.
Specialty screws and the screws that hold outlet covers usually have flathead
screws. You can also use your flathead screwdriver for opening paint cans.
To install any screw, select a screwdriver with the right head and handle length to
accommodate your project. Twist in a clockwise (to the right) direction. To remove
the screw, twist in a counterclockwise (to the left) direction. (Don’t forget: “Righty
tighty, lefty loosey.”)
Using an electric drill
An electric drill is a power tool that can drill a hole through almost anything! Before
drilling, you need to select the proper type of drill bit (different bits are designed to
drill through wood, masonry, metal, glass, and so on) and size of drill bit (1⁄4 inch, 
3⁄8 inch, 1⁄2 inch, 5⁄8 inch, and so on). For a strong installation, always use a drill bit
that’s slightly smaller than the screw being inserted into the hole. Here’s where math
comes in handy! If you’re going to install a 1⁄2-inch screw, recall that 1⁄2 equals 4⁄8 or 8⁄16,
and so you should use a slightly smaller bit like a 3⁄8 inch or 7⁄16 inch. If you drill a hole
that’s the same size or larger than the screw, the installation won’t be as strong as
with a smaller hole because the screw will be loose in the hole.
19
Chapter 3: Nailing Down Carpentry Fundamentals

In this book, you use an electric drill only to drill holes, not to insert screws. When
you use an electric drill to insert screws, the drill tends to wobble and enlarge the
opening of the hole, which reduces the strength of the hold.
Prepare for your installation by marking the spot you intend to drill into and ensuring
you can drill at a perpendicular angle by using a ladder or crouching down. If you
have to reach above your head to drill, the hole is likely to slant upward, lessening
the strength of your installation. After selecting the proper drill bit for your installa-
tion, make sure your drill is in “Forward” mode and apply consistent horizontal pres-
sure to the marked spot as you pull the trigger, as shown in Figure 3-2. (Of course, if
you’re drilling into the ceiling, you apply consistent vertical pressure.) You should
feel some resistance after about 1⁄2 inch as your drill passes through the drywall and
enters the wood stud (I discuss studs earlier in this chapter). When your drill bit is
completely into the wood and you can’t drill any farther, pull your drill out of the stud
or switch your drill into “Reverse” mode, and the drill bit should easily retract.
Figure 3-2: Drill your holes perpendicular to a wall by starting off at the right height.
Answering a Few Frequently
Asked Carpentry Questions
Carpentry, like any field, has its share of frequently asked questions. This section
provides insight into commonly encountered carpentry situations.
Should you use wood board or
plywood for your project?
When you understand the difference between different types of wood products, it’s
easier to decide which one is appropriate for your project. Here’s the breakdown:
20
Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects 


Wood board is a solid piece of wood cut from the vertical length of a tree.
It’s available in either softwood (fir, pine, cedar) or hardwood (oak); hard-
wood is considerably more expensive than softwood. Wood board is great
for projects in which the wood is visible, like a shelf with visible wood grain.
If you plan to paint your project, you can use less expensive plywood.
Visible knots and disfigurations can mar the appearance, and subsequently
reduce the price, of wood lumber. Some people appreciate the natural look
of real lumber, though, so if you choose to use wood board for your project,
you may want to show it off by applying a wood stain or veneer.
Wood board comes in several standard sizes, like 1x4. This size is mislead-
ing, though; the dimensions of a 1x4 are really 3⁄4 x 31⁄2 inches. The standard
sizes refer to the thickness of a rough cut of raw lumber, but some wood (1⁄4
to 1⁄2 inch) is inevitably lost when the lumber is milled to create the final cut.

Plywood is constructed of many thin layers of wood glued together, and
it’s less expensive than wood board. The way that the layers are glued
together — with the grains going in opposite directions — makes plywood
very strong, so it’s good to use when you need to drill through the thickness
of the wood or when you need a large sheet of wood for the back of a cabinet
or the base of a box. The top of plywood is attractive when sanded and
stained, but the edge will never be as attractive as wood board because you
can see all the glued-together layers. Plywood comes in several standard
thicknesses, such as 1⁄8 inch, 1⁄4 inch, 3⁄8 inch, and so on. Plywood sheets come
in one standard size, 48x96, but your local store may carry additional cuts.
Can you use nails rather than screws?
I advocate a screw and screwdriver installation over a hammer and nail installation
throughout this book because . . . well, screws are better. Screws are stronger
because they grip the wood as they’re inserted, you can install them perfectly
straight if you predrill your holes with a drill, and you can uninstall and reinstall
screws without damage. If there’s a chance that you’ll remove your item from the
wall or wherever it’s installed, you should always use screws.
Don’t throw away your hammer (or nail gun) just yet, though! Nails are recom-
mended if you’re trying to install a fastener into the thickness of plywood because a
drill and screw installation may split the wood. An example of this installation is nail-
ing through one piece of wood into another to form a corner of a wood box. You also
can use nails if you can’t maneuver an electric drill into a tight spot, like a drawer or
the inside of a cabinet (see the next section for details).
The advantage of using nails rather than screws in some situations is that installa-
tion is much faster! You don’t need to predrill holes, and you can drive in nails in
seconds. You also can hide nails by using a nail set to drive the nail farther into the
wood, and covering the nail head with wood putty. Just make sure it’s a permanent
installation before burying the nail head with a nail set!
What if your drill won’t fit into tight spaces?
Some projects require you to drill holes in tight spaces, like the cabinet under the
sink. If you can’t maneuver your drill in this area, try using a hammer and nail to 
21
Chapter 3: Nailing Down Carpentry Fundamentals

create a hole for your screw. Use a nail with a diameter that’s slightly smaller than
the diameter of the screw to ensure a tight fit. After you tap in the nail partway, use
the claw side of the hammer to remove the nail. You have a hole ready for your screw!
When do you use drywall anchors?
Often the only thing supporting the weight of an object hanging on a wall is a single
screw drilled into a stud. But what if a stud isn’t available? Drilling the screw directly
into drywall only is a recipe for disaster. When there’s no wood stud where you need
to hang an item, turn to drywall anchors. Drywall anchors are plastic or metal inserts
that fit into holes drilled in drywall and then accept the mounting screws; an anchor
can strengthen the installation of a screw into drywall by expanding and trapping
the screw in the wall. An installation using drywall anchors isn’t as reliable as screw-
ing into a stud, but it’s better than using a plain screw in drywall.
Most products include drywall anchors as part of the mounting materials. Drywall
anchors come in standard sizes that correspond to the standard sizes of screws; for
example, a 3⁄16-inch diameter screw requires an anchor with an internal 3⁄16-inch diame-
ter. The anchor wraps around the screw, and you need to use a larger drill bit (slightly
smaller than the size of the external diameter of the anchor) to install the anchor.
Different anchors are available, depending on the weight of the item you’re hanging:

For lightweight items like decorations and small wall shelves, use plastic 
or metal wall anchors. Drill a hole into the wall that’s slightly smaller than
the anchor. Insert the anchor by hand, and tap it with your hammer until it
goes all the way into the hole. Install your screw into the anchor using a
screwdriver.

For heavier items like large picture frames, mirrors, and sturdy shelves, you
need to use a stronger fixture like a Molly bolt or toggle bolt. These items
spring open when they’re installed through the drywall, and they widen the
grip of the screw. Insert Molly bolts or toggle bolts by drilling a hole wide
enough for the bolt to fit through, inserting the bolt, and triggering it open
by turning the screw clockwise with your screwdriver (see Figure 3-3). When
the bolt is open, you’ll feel resistance because the fixture has fully opened
against the drywall. Sometimes you need a second screwdriver to do this.

Part I: Preparing for Your Organizing Projects 

Part II
Organizing Primary Spaces
in Your Home

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is devoted to organizing the major
workhorses of your home — your entryway/living
room, kitchen, bedroom/closet, bathroom, and home
office. These are the primary living spaces in your home,
and with each subsequent transformation, your home 
life will run smoother. An organized space promotes an
organized life, and before long you and your family will be
performing day-to-day tasks quicker and more efficiently.
Isn’t this what you’ve been waiting for?
Each chapter in this part focuses entirely on one key
space in your house, and I walk you through organizing
the room start to finish. I help you identify the goal of the
space, address the room’s limitations, empty and sort 
the contents, build projects, and complete the room with
finishing touches. Experience the transformation from 
a frustrating cluttered space that makes you anxious 
to a peaceful room with everything in its place. Blissful
bedrooms, clutter-free kitchens, and more await you.

T
he function and goal of the entryway and living room is to gra-
ciously welcome you into a warm, inviting space while simulta-
neously gathering and storing your purse, hat, coat, gloves, and scarf.
This is the space guests see first as they walk through the front door,
and people will develop a first impression of the way you live based
on this space. A pile of clothing and accessories on the floor signals a
household that’s disorganized and careless, whereas a streamlined
and visually interesting space showcases your strengths. Because
perception is key, put your best foot forward! Your goal is to trans-
form your entryway and living room into a visually appealing space
that stores a deceptive amount of clothing, accessories, media, and
literature.
Most homes don’t have a large, formal entryway with room for a fancy console table,
a dramatic chandelier, and stunning artwork and accessories. Generally, an entry-
way is just the initial passageway between the front door and the living room. If you
have a few feet of available wall space, you can convert this passageway into an
effective flytrap that captures coats, purses, and hats as people come through the
front door. If your family uses an entryway/mudroom that attaches to your garage or
back door, you can still use the projects and tips in this chapter to enhance your
storage in that area.
When you organize your entryway and living room, you have to work around the lim-
itations that are specific to your space. Identify your limitations by answering these
questions:

Do you watch TV or listen to music in your living room? If so, do you have
enough storage for CDs, DVDs, remote controls, and video games?

Do you have a desk or computer in your living room?

Is your home library in your living room? Do you have enough storage for
your books?

Do you need to dress up your fireplace mantle or foyer table?

Are you displaying too many decorations and knickknacks?
After you address the goals and limitations of your entryway and living room, it’s
time to review their contents. Each item should fall into one of the following four
categories:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the room. Examples are entryway items (frequently used
coats, scarves, hats, backpacks, sunglasses, umbrellas, and shoes), furni-
ture (couches, tables, lamps, and pet beds), tasteful accessories, media
components, board games, books, and photo albums.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and is used often, but it doesn’t
belong in the entryway or living room. Examples are pet supplies, exercise
equipment, and work projects.

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the goal of the space. Examples are
unnecessary or outdated furniture, media components, board games,
books, and unused photo albums.

GO: These broken or damaged items are trash!
After you determine what stays in your entryway and living room, select the projects
in this chapter that will help you maximize the storage in this space. When you’re
done, check out the section “The Finishing Touches: Reassembling Your Entryway
and Living Room” at the end of this chapter for ideas on maintaining your room’s
organization.
Decorating the designer way
By adding a few decorative shelves and
sprucing up your entryway’s foyer table and
living room’s fireplace mantle, you can turn
your ordinary house into an exquisite home.
Trim back your decorations and accessories
to those that are consistent with the décor of
your home and in good condition — and that
you like looking at! Large, solid-colored
items tend to read better visually than small
knickknacks. Keep a room interesting by
changing out your accents with each season!
Your foyer table is an excellent place to make
a quality first impression. It’s more decora-
tive than functional, so focus on showcasing
framed photos or fresh flowers. Large items
like lamps or floral displays look best indi-
vidually, whereas smaller items like candles
look best in groups of three. The coffee table
is best left empty or adorned with a single
decoration or a stack of books — leave room
for the coffee!
Here are some tips for your mantle:
 Empty it of any clutter and media or elec-
tronics paraphernalia. The mantle is an
architectural feature that deserves to be
shown off!
 Dress up your empty mantle with can-
dles, picture frames, and vases in colors
that accent your living room décor.
 Rather than redecorating your entire room
for each holiday, consider concentrating
your holiday décor on your mantle. Potted
flowers and pastel eggs signal the begin-
ning of spring. A collection of gourds and
colorful leaves make an interesting fall
display, and you probably have some
prized Christmas or other holiday items
that deserve top billing on the mantle.
 If you don’t have a mantle, install a wood
shelf or beam above your fireplace, and
then decorate it as you would a mantle.
(Check out Chapter 7 for basic instructions
on installing whimsical wall shelves.)

Need to Know
“May I take your coat?” Offering to take a guest’s coat is a thoughtful 
gesture . . . if you have a suitable place to store it. If you want to hang 
coats and purses in your entryway but don’t have a roomy coat closet, try
a wall-mounted peg rack! These racks are designed to hold a substantial
amount of weight on individual pegs and are a great alternative to clumsy,
wobbly coat racks. Select a sturdy model with a wood tone or paint color
that blends in with the wall it will be mounted on; after all, this item is
more functional than decorative. Many models have double hooks in lieu 
of pegs that allow you to store both a coat and a hat on an individual hook.
Isn’t that clever? 
A peg rack needs to be installed into one or more wall studs.

28
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 
Identify the location of your peg rack. If your
entryway door opens to the left, consider the adja-
cent wall on the left side of the door so the door
will naturally disguise the peg rack when ajar.
Select a height that accommodates all members of
your family (usually around 50 to 60 inches so that
coats won’t drag on the floor), and mark the
height on the wall. 
Locate and mark two or three wall studs at your
desired height with a stud finder. Sturdy peg
racks that support the weight of heavy coats need
to be installed into one or more wall studs, and
the number of studs you use depends on the
width of your rack.
1
2
Hold the rack to the wall along the studs at your
chosen height and use a pencil to mark through
the holes where you’ll drill. Note that some
models require that you detach the hanging
mechanisms from the rack before you hang it.
Use a level to ensure that the hole marks from
Step 3 are even.

Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required to hang the rack, drill holes in
the marked spots, applying consistent horizontal
pressure.
If any of holes you drilled in Step 5 aren’t 
installed into wall studs, insert drywall anchors 
to strengthen the installation. Drill holes that are
slightly smaller than the anchors, tap the anchors
into the holes with a hammer, and insert the
screws.
Screw the rack into the wall with a screwdriver.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
A nook (or any space) near an entryway is an ideal candidate for shoe 
storage, hanging storage, and accessory storage, all in one convenient 
location. Before purchasing your storage components, accurately measure
the dimensions of your space. Measure the height along the back wall.
Determine the depth by measuring from the front to the back of the space,
and determine the width by measuring from the left side wall to the right
side.
Write down your measurements, and then carefully plan your components.
A storage tower is comprised of a lower level slotted shoe rack or storage
bench for shoes, a mid-level locker/cabinet for coats or backpacks, and 
an overhead cubby for purses, wallets, keys, and other small items. Shop
for tower components with a similar width because they’ll be stacked 
vertically, and make sure you have enough width and depth in your space
for all the components you buy. Also make sure that you have enough height
for each tower. If you’re running into height constraints, I recommend using 
a shoe rack instead of a storage bench. 

Locate the wall studs in the back of your space
with a stud finder and mark them in pencil.
Determine the height of the locker by measuring
the distance from the bottom to the top of the
locker.
To determine the height at which to hang the
locker, add together the height of the shoe stor-
age (with lid open, if using a bench) and the meas-
urement from Step 2. Measure the total distance
from the floor along the wall stud and mark it in
pencil.

Note that nooks often have a front wall overhang that defines the space.This means that you can store items up
to the full ceiling height of the nook along the back wall, but the front wall overhang may make stowing and
retrieving items difficult. Make sure that the front wall overhang of the nook (if there is one) doesn’t interfere
with retrieving items from the upper cubby.

Align the top of the locker with the height you
marked in Step 3. Use a level to ensure that your
locker will hang evenly.
With a helper holding the locker in place and
using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the installation, drill holes
through the back of the locker and into the wall
studs, applying consistent horizontal pressure.

If you have the space, consider building a storage tower for each member of your household. If you have a very
large household or limited space, members can share storage.

Screw the locker into the wall with a screwdriver.
Center the cubby on top of the locker, and use a
pencil to mark holes for drilling through the hang-
ing mechanisms.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screw required for the installation, drill holes in
the marked spots, using consistent horizontal
pressure. (If the holes don’t line up with the wall
studs marked in Step 1, add drywall anchors to
strengthen the installation.)
With a helper holding the cubby in place, screw
the cubby into the wall with a screwdriver.
Repeat this installation for additional stor-
age towers.

your entryway.

Subscribing to four magazines a year (like the average American house-
hold) and saving all your back issues adds up to about 24 horizontal
inches of storage a year. People tend to forget that magazines are meant to
be enjoyed and recycled!
This project is a clever solution for storing the current issues of your favorite
magazines. This magazine rack has several rows of hanging space to display
(and mark your spot in) the magazines you’re actively reading. The rack 
consists of narrow vertical wood beams that support horizontal “magazine
holder” dowels; you insert the dowels into drilled holes in the beams.
You need one dowel per magazine, so purchase the desired number of 
1⁄4-inch wooden dowels at your local hardware store and have them cut into
17-inch lengths. Purchase two hardwood 1x2 side supports that will attach
to the wall and support the dowels (see Chapter 3 for more information on
lumber). The length of the rails depends on the number of dowels on your
rack; allow 10 inches per dowel. For example, for a five-dowel rack, you
need two 50-inch 1x2s.

Lightly sand the wooden dowels and supports,
and then wipe them down with a clean, damp rag
to prepare the surface for paint or stain.
Use a stir stick to stir the paint or stain you plan
to use on the dowels and supports to match them
to the décor of your living room. Use a paintbrush
or sponge brush to apply the product to the
dowels and supports according to the manufac-
turer’s directions.
Note: Let the paint or stain dry completely before
you move on to Step 4.

Using a pencil, measure and mark your first spot
to drill 1 inch from the end of one support. Be
sure to mark the 2-inch side of the 1x2.
Mark 10-inch increments on the support, starting
with the mark from Step 4. Repeat the measuring
and marking on the second support.

Position the 1-inch side of your first side support
vertically along the wall stud. Use a level to
ensure that the side support is completely
vertical. (You may want to have a helper hold 
the support in place while you prepare to attach
it to the wall.)
Wearing safety goggles, use a nail gun loaded with
3-inch nails to nail through the 1-inch side of the
1x2 and into the wall. Continue nailing the first
support to the wall, making sure to locate nails
between the holes for the dowels, every 3 to 
4 inches.
Position one wood support on a surface that you
can drill completely through to, whether it’s a
workbench, sawhorse, or even on grass in your
yard. Hold the support firmly in place, and use a 5⁄16-
inch drill bit to drill all the way through the wood
support at your first mark 1 inch from the end,
applying consistent vertical pressure. Continue to
drill all remaining holes on both supports.
Decide where to hang your magazine rack in your
living room, and locate a wall stud with a stud
finder. Mark along the stud in pencil.

If you use dowels with a larger diameter (envision a rolling pin), magazines will slide right off, so 1⁄4 inch is best.

Attach end caps to each dowel to prevent it from
slipping out.
Wearing safety goggles, use a nail gun loaded with
3-inch nails to nail through the 1-inch side of the
1x2 and into the wall. Continue nailing the second
support to the wall, making sure to locate nails
between the holes for the dowels, every 3 to 4
inches.
Thread your dowels through each set of holes.
Locate a second stud 16 inches from the first wall
stud, and mark along the stud in pencil.
Position the 1-inch side of your second side sup-
port vertically along this wall stud. Use a level to
ensure that the second side support is both com-
pletely plumb and level with the first support.
(You may want to have a helper hold the support
in place while you prepare to attach it to the wall.)

How many magazines would you like to dis-

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Entryway and Living Room
After you’ve installed one, some, or all the projects that appear earlier in this chap-
ter, it’s time to put your entryway and living room back together again. The following
sections provide some inspirational and functional ideas for continuing to “wow”
beyond the first impression.
Organizing furniture and major electronics
You may live in an electronic world, but that doesn’t mean you want to look at elec-
tronic gadgets and gizmos all the time! Where possible, put the following ideas to
use in your home:

Group your furniture in such a way that the TV isn’t the main focal point of
the room. For example, highlight your fireplace by angling couches and arm
chairs toward this feature. Similarly, you can highlight a picturesque
window view with furniture placement.

Consider transferring your TV to an armoire with doors. You can hide the
TV behind closed doors when it isn’t in use and enjoy looking at a nice
piece of furniture instead of a blank screen.

Hang a wall of heavy draperies to disguise your flat panel TV. This tech-
nique provides an opportunity to add an interesting decorative feature to
the room with patterned or solid-colored drapery fabric. Achieve this dra-
matic effect by hanging draperies just below the ceiling or crown molding.
You’ll likely need to purchase a custom-sized rod or use a succession of
rods to accommodate the full length of the wall.

If your home office is in your living room, position a folding screen or large
potted plant in front of your office nook. This trick visually separates your
office space from your living space. (See Chapter 8 for details on organizing
your home office.)
Storing movies
Stacks of movies can be frustrating to manage. If you don’t have enough room to
keep them in a cabinet or container of some sort, the piles collect dust, get knocked
over, and are perpetually disorganized so that it’s hard to find the movie you want.
Most people hold on to movies that they may watch . . . someday. With so many new
releases, how can you keep up? Review your collection during the sorting phase I
describe at the beginning of this chapter, and ask yourself the following questions:

Is it a family favorite that you plan to watch again? If the answer is yes, it
can stay — for now.

Have you seen it before and feel you can pass it on? If the answer is yes,
move it to your SHARE pile.
38
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 


Is it a bulky VHS tape? If the answer is yes, consider replacing it with a DVD
version. VHS players have almost exclusively been replaced by DVD players
(hint, hint). VHS tapes have a shorter lifespan than DVDs and are more diffi-
cult to store (hint, hint). If you have a VHS tape with sentimental content,
like a wedding or family holiday video, consider having it professionally
transferred to a DVD at your local audio/video store or through a number of
online options like www.dvdyourmemories.com.
After you’ve trimmed your movie collection, consider transferring your DVD collec-
tion to a media storage folder. About 2 inches wide, the folder unzips to reveal more
than 200 DVDs, looks attractive, and is simple to store on a shelf near your DVD
player, in a decorative box, or tucked into storage/seating cubes. Recycle the left-
over plastic DVD cases and paper inserts. 
Music to your ears: Dealing with CDs
Music-lovers or not, most people collect music CDs. Before long, your collection of
music can become a wobbly 6-foot tall tower. Then how are you supposed to access
that classic ZZ Top disc down at the bottom?
After you sort through your CD collection, donate anything that you won’t listen to
again and pitch anything that’s broken or badly scratched (as I describe at the
beginning of this chapter). Consider transferring your remaining music CDs to your
computer hard drive. As a backup, you can store your CD collection in a tidy media
storage folder on a bookshelf, in a media cabinet, or in a decorative box. Recycle the
empty plastic jewel cases and paper inserts.
The plastic sleeves in media storage folders are roomy enough to store the paper
inserts that include the album covers and lyrics. If you like the look and feel of these
inserts and can’t bear to part with the information they contain, store them in the
plastic pockets in your media storage folder!
Recent advances in digital technology have made the average person as capable as a
music DJ when it comes to storing and accessing music collections. Embrace this
revolution, but don’t let it take over your space. If you’re a music lover, purchase
and download music online. 
If you prefer to store your CDs in their original jewel cases, there are a multitude of
options available for collections small to large. Units are widely available in home or
electronic stores and range from 12-CD wire shelves to 500-CD large wooden cabi-
nets. If you plan to store your music in jewel cases, select a unit that’s sturdy,
matches your room’s décor, and can accommodate your entire collection.
Store only the CDs that you love, and leave a little wiggle room on your shelves for
new purchases!

Game on! Arranging video game equipment
Many people enjoy playing video games, but they don’t enjoy dealing with all the
necessary equipment, including

Consoles

Accessories (joysticks, nunchucks, steering wheels, boxing gloves, guitars,
and so on)

Game cartridges and discs
Here are a few ideas for taming the tangle of games, cords, and beeping things:

Rolling cart: Rolling carts come in a variety of materials — wire, stainless
steel, and plastic. Because video gaming equipment isn’t very heavy, any of
these materials are ideal.
Estimate the number of levels you need; I recommend positioning the con-
sole on the top, the accessories in the middle, and the cartridges/discs on
the bottom. Purchase a rolling cart with a lip on each tray so items don’t
slip off. Two-tier carts are sufficient to store a console and cartridges.
Three- and four-tier carts are best for dealing with odd-shaped accessories
like guitars and steering wheels.
I recommend leaving the console on the cart and plugging the cord directly
into your TV. If you’re constantly moving your console to and from the cart,
it’s likely to get damaged. After using your video game cart, collect excess
cord length at the back of the console and secure with a twist tie or clip.
Return the cart to a nearby hallway closet, spare bedroom, or space under-
neath a staircase. If you don’t have an alternative storage space, you can
conceal the cart and its contents with a customized fabric cover.

Wire tower: The wire tower is an inexpensive option very similar to the tiered
rolling cart. It’s an ideal fit if you want your gaming equipment to be at arm’s
length and in plain sight — always. The best location for a tower is directly
adjacent to your television because it’s part of your living room media. 

Storage cube: If you want your gaming console connected at all times and
only want to store your games and accessories, consider stashing them in a
decorative storage ottoman or cube. When no one is gaming, the top can
display a collection of magazines or a decorative throw as well as serve as
added seating in your living room.

Media storage folder: Like DVDs and CDs (see the previous sections), you
can discreetly store video game discs in media storage folders. Store these
folders on a bookshelf, in an entertainment center, or hidden in a
storage/seating cube. Don’t forget to recycle the cases and inserts!
Jazzing up bookshelves
A small home library is a timeless decorating element that enhances the warmth of
any home. If you choose to display books in your living room, stick to traditional
approaches such as built-in bookshelves and stand-alone bookcases anchored to
walls, but don’t forget to interject some whimsy! After you sort, share, and pitch
books (as I describe at the beginning of this chapter), try the following tips:
40
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 


Group books by topic. You can dedicate shelves to finance, history,
romance, travel, architecture — wherever your interests may lie. Add a
small framed photo that correlates to the topic on each shelf.

Group books by size. If your bookshelves are at fixed heights (meaning
they’re not adjustable within the bookcase), group books by size. For each
size group, start with the shortest book on the outside edge of the shelf and
gradually increase in size toward a focal point or even the center of the
room. For example, if a bookshelf is on the left side of a fireplace, angle the
books from shortest (left) to tallest (right) so they rise toward the fireplace.

Group books by color. Add visual interest by grouping your books by color
and then arranging them by size, such as all red- and orange-toned books on
one shelf from tallest to shortest and all black and blue-toned books on
another shelf from shortest to tallest.

Corral loose books. Very thin books or paperback manuals are a challenge to
display because they don’t like to stand up. Gather all such books into a deco-
rative open-top box and use it as a divider between sets of books on shelves.

Add bookends or heavy objects every 18 inches or so to prevent slipping.
Heavy ceramic vases, fossils, and beer steins are interesting choices. Use
pieces that fit within the decorating scheme of your living room.

Add unexpected accessories with a personal touch, like old-fashioned
cameras, hand-painted coconuts, or small African drums.

Display a collection of oversized books on your coffee table. Select three
to five books and stack them with the largest on the bottom. Change your
collection regularly.

Make your bookshelves pop by painting the back wall of the bookcase an
accent color that complements other parts of your room.
If you have a large volume of books in your SHARE pile, consider donating them to
your local library or selling them at a used-book store. Or after reading a particularly
good book, write a personal note in the front cover and pass it on to a friend or
neighbor. To maintain a reasonable collection going forward, stick to the principle of
“One in, one out.”
Putting together fabulous photo albums
When it comes to photos, less is more. Only keep photographs that feature the sub-
jects looking at the camera (or at least looking good), highlight a memory, or capture
those people who are dear to you. Discard boring or unflattering pictures. Duplicate
photos can be discarded or shared with friends and family.
Create quality photo albums by highlighting the best parts of an event, vacation, or
time period. Select photos for your albums that show a mixture of candid and posed
photos, a variety of subjects, and a variety of emotions. For example, reinforce won-
derful memories from your cousin’s wedding with a page featuring a black-and-white
photo of the bride, a group photo with your side of the family, the ring bearer goof-
ing off, and your grandmother giving a heartfelt toast. Now that’s a memory!

Chapter 4: First Impressions: Streamlining Your Entryway and Living Room

Sharing photo albums allows you to connect with your friends and family, recall
funny memories, and retell old stories. Make the most of this experience by sticking
to the following tips:

Photo preservation: Use acid-free albums and photo paper to extend the
life of your prints. For photos that you don’t place in albums, store them in
an archival quality box to protect them from mold, dust, and pests. Store
the box in an area of your home that’s free of moisture, bright light, and
extreme temperatures, such as the top of the entryway closet or in an enter-
tainment center cabinet.

Photo albums: Don’t overdo it! Buy a few basic albums and fill them up with
a handful of photos per event. For example, label a book “Vacation
Memories” and add 10 to 20 photos per trip. People looking through your
album would rather see the highlights of a few family trips than the play-by-
play of one single trip.

Photo books: Embrace digital photo technology by creating custom photo
books online for about $30 a piece. Select the size, cover, and layout of your
book, upload digital photos, add captions, and place your order. The photos
and captions are printed directly onto the pages of your hardcover or
paperback book. Many Web sites offer photo book creation, including
www.mypublisher.com, www.kodakgallery.com, www.shutterfly.
com, www.snapfish.com, and www.lulu.com.
Stowing board games
Board games are great for family bonding, lessons in teamwork and taking turns, and
having fun. Many board games are classics and, if properly stored, can be passed
down to the next generation. Review your collection of board games and follow
these guidelines:

If they’re no longer used, consider sharing them with friends or family or
donating them to charity.

If they’re missing a significant number of pieces, either contact the manufac-
turer to order replacement parts or trash them.

If you want to keep commonly used board games but the boxes are dam-
aged, use masking tape to repair the box or transfer the entire contents of
the game to a new box and label it.
After you decide which games to keep, follow these organizational tips:

Store groups of like-sized games in sturdy plastic containers in your enter-
tainment center, on bookshelves, or in a nearby closet.

Collect small items that don’t stack well, like decks of cards and dice, in a
separate box.

Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 

T
raditionally, the kitchen was simply a utilitarian room used
for food preparation. Today, the role of the kitchen has
expanded to make it the heart of the home — the space where
people congregate, meals are prepared together, guests are enter-
tained, home office functions are performed, and days are planned.
This is the hardest working room in your home and therefore 
should be given special attention when organizing. The projects 
in this chapter help you clear off your counters, make the most 
of your kitchen’s walls and ceilings, and maximize your storage 
space.
Before you tackle any projects, however, your first step in organizing
your kitchen is to determine its goal. Each do-it-yourself organizer will
have a different goal for his or her kitchen, depending on how the
space is used. When you’re determining the goal of your kitchen, 
consider its functions by answering these questions:

Do you entertain in your kitchen? Do you want to?

Do you serve meals in your kitchen, dining room, or both?

Do you have a small home office in your kitchen?

Do your children do homework in your kitchen?
Your kitchen should only store items necessary for its function.
After you determine the goal of your kitchen, the next step is to identify your
kitchen’s limitations. If you have a newly built home, your kitchen likely has a casual
eating area, a pantry (a large one if you’re lucky), and possibly even an office nook.
You may have all the storage space you need — lucky you! If your kitchen was built
in a different era, however, you probably lack storage space and counter space.
When you’re assessing your space, consider the limitations of your kitchen by
answering these questions:

Do you have enough cabinet storage for all your dinnerware and
appliances?

Do you have enough pantry storage for all your food?

Is your counter space too limited or crowded for food preparation?


Do you need to store large or rarely used items in a garage or basement?

Do you shop at bulk warehouse stores and require storage for very large
items?
Your kitchen can only perform as many functions as the size, layout, and storage
space will permit.
After you figure out your kitchen’s limitations, it’s time to sort. Even a mildly disor-
ganized do-it-yourselfer can benefit from this step! Begin by removing all items from
your pantry, cabinets, drawers, closets, and bins. (All that should remain are the
items in your refrigerator and freezer.) This crucial step allows you to assess what
you have and enables you to quickly eliminate items that don’t support your goal or
aren’t mindful of your kitchen’s limitations.
A tried-and-true method is to sort your kitchen items into four large containers
labeled as follows:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the kitchen. Examples include appliances, pots, pans, plates,
and cups.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and is used often, but it doesn’t sup-
port your goal for the kitchen. Examples include sewing kits, photos, sun-
glasses, and keys.

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the kitchen’s goal. Examples are mis-
matched plates, food your family doesn’t enjoy, and unused appliances.

GO: This item is trash! Examples include expired or stale food and broken
items.
Get your whole family involved in sorting the kitchen. Assign your children the task
of sorting through their food items, containers, and lunchboxes. Another fun idea is
to throw a “happy kitchen party” — invite a few of your close friends over, serve a
festive beverage, and get them to help you tackle the kitchen. Don’t forget to return
the favor and help your friends organize their kitchens!
After you finish sorting, pick out the projects in this chapter that appeal to you, and
get started! When you’re done, check out the section “The Finishing Touches:
Reassembling Your Kitchen” at the end of this chapter for ideas on keeping your
kitchen as organized as possible.

Installing an Under-the-Cabinet 
Paper Towel Holder
Home organization is so mainstream nowadays that entire stores are
devoted to kitchen organization! You can find specialty appliances and
gadgets specifically made to attach to the underside of your cabinets.
These products are great because they clear bulky items off your counters! 
One quick and easy counter-clearing project is to install a paper towel
holder onto the underside of an upper cabinet. The floor of a kitchen cabi-
net is about 1⁄2 inch thick, so you should verify that the length of the screws
included with the holder don’t exceed the thickness of the holder plus the
floor of the cabinet. If they’re too long, stop at the hardware store to
replace them with shorter screws.

Identify the location of your paper towel holder
on the underside of your cabinet. Mark the holes
onto the underside of your cabinet by sticking a
pencil through the screw holes. Use a measuring
tape to verify that the hole marks are equidistant
from the front edge of the cabinet.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for your paper towel
holder, drill holes in the marked spots, applying
consistent vertical pressure.

Materials:
 Message board (with
mounting hard-
ware)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Large home stores, office supply stores, and home improvement centers all
sell message boards. An ideal message board has a cork or magnetic area to
hang invitations, announcements, and calendars, and a dry-erase/chalkboard
area to leave notes for other household members. The board is a great home
for frequently used phone numbers, rosters, and activity calendars.
Message boards are available in both vertical and horizontal designs with a
wide variety of dimensions. The center of the message board should hang at
eye level for adults and approximately 6 to 12 inches below adult eye level
for families with younger children. Select a central location for your message
board, ideally near the phone in your kitchen. Measure the available space in
this location and purchase a message board that fits the space. 

Determine the vertical center of the frame by
measuring the distance from the bottom to the
top of the frame, and dividing this measurement
by 2. Use a pencil to mark this point in pencil on
the backside of the message board.
Locate one hanging mechanism on the back of the
frame (it’s usually a bracket, wire, or tab). With a
tape measure, measure the vertical distance
between the marked vertical center from Step 1
and the hanging mechanism. 
Using a pencil, mark the spot on the wall that rep-
resents your eye-level height. You can determine
this height by standing in front of the wall and
extending your arm in a straight line from your
eye to the wall. If you want a more precise meas-
urement, subtract 3 inches from your height, and
then measure that distance up the wall from the
floor. In the case of a family with young children,
lower this mark by 6 to 12 inches so that they can
easily see the board.

What time is soccer practice?  What’s for dinner tonight?  One kid is coming, another is going, and you’re left
trying to sort out the daily schedule. If you’re managing a busy household, I recommend a large message board!

Using the measurement obtained in Step 2, meas-
ure up from the eye-level height, and mark a
second spot at the height at which you will drill
the hole for the mounting screw.
Note: If your message board has hanging mecha-
nisms at both upper corners, you have to do a
little more measuring! Measure the distance from
the vertical center to the top of the message
board and the distance from the top center to
each corner. After you mark your eye-level height
on the wall in Step 3, measure upwards the dis-
tance from the vertical center to the top of the
board and outwards the distance from the top
center to each corner. Use a level to check that
your marks are level.
If your message board is extremely heavy,
you should drill into a wall stud. See
Chapter 3 to find information on locating a
wall stud.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screw or screws that correspond with
the hanging mechanisms, drill a hole into the wall
at the spot marked in Step 4, applying consistent
horizontal pressure. If your board has more than
one hanging mechanism, also drill holes at the
other marked spots.
Add drywall anchors to any holes that aren’t in
wall studs. Simply position the drywall anchor
into the predrilled hole and tap with a hammer
until the anchor is almost completely in the hole.

Organizing your dining room
You can have a family dinner anywhere,
from a restaurant to a kitchen island to a
local park, but doing it the old-fashioned
way — in the dining room — gives you a
chance to establish routines and traditions. 
People typically use one or two key pieces
of furniture to store all their dining needs:
 A hutch is a vertical storage cabinet,
generally with glass door cabinets for
display and wood door cabinets for stor-
age. A hutch may also have drawers.
This furniture piece is ideal if you have a
tall or narrow wall space and want to use
the height of the wall. It’s also beneficial
if you want to display your dinnerware
or collections.
 A buffet is a horizontal storage cabinet
with wood door cabinets and drawers.
This piece is a good fit for a dining room
with a long wall space. Additionally,
because it’s table height, your buffet can
work as a surface to hold drinks, condi-
ments, and food platters during meals.
Where does everything go?
 Glass-front cabinets: These are for dis-
playing your favorite pieces of china,
wine glasses, or family heirlooms! Focus
on a few visually interesting pieces rather
than trying to store an entire collection in
one cabinet. Less is definitely more!
 Wood-door cabinets: Dining room cabi-
nets hold your china, serving platters,
and barware. You may find it helpful to
maximize this valuable cabinet space by
using shelf stackers, china racks, or Lazy
Susans (which I discuss later in this
chapter). Protect infrequently used china
by using padded china storage contain-
ers to keep away dust and prevent chip-
ping.
 Drawers: These are for storing all your
dining accessories, such as linens, napkin
rings, decorations, and small items.
Consider dedicating one drawer to
linens: Place tablecloths and napkins
towards the back of the drawer and col-
lect napkin rings in a small box toward
the front of the drawer. A second drawer
can be dedicated to accessories like can-
dles and tabletop decorations.
If your space is getting too crowded, trans-
fer infrequently used items or heirlooms to
a garage for long-term storage (see Chapter
11). Donate anything you don’t use or don’t
like (I promise I won’t tell Grandma!).

Stuff You 
Need to Know
A utensil rack is an example of a kitchen storage device that’s both practical
and visually pleasing! This kind of rack, which is generally located along
your backsplash (that area of wall between the counter and cabinet), holds
a few frequently used utensils. Many home stores sell utensil rack sets that
include matching utensils for a more put-together look.
Identify the location of your utensil rack. To deter-
mine whether there’s enough vertical distance to
hang your rack between your counter and cabinets
(the difference is typically 18 inches), measure the
longest utensil you plan to hang. If the item is less
than 15 inches (providing a 3-inch clearance), then
you have sufficient room to locate your rack in
your chosen location. If you plan to hang longer
utensils on your rack (such as barbecue tongs),
you need to be able to hang it higher on the wall,
which means a location void of wall cabinets to
allow enough vertical clearance.
1

Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for mounting the rack,
drill holes into the marked spots, applying consis-
tent horizontal pressure.
Screw your utensil rack into the wall with a 
screwdriver.
Hold the rack up to the wall, and use a pencil to
mark the spots where you’ll drill your holes by
pushing the pencil through the screw holes. You
may want to use a measuring tape to measure a
consistent height, like 2 inches from the top of the
upper cabinet to the top of your rack.
Use a level to ensure that your marks are level so
that your rack won’t hang crookedly.

Finding a home for duplicate utensils
After you figure out which of your utensils to
hang on your rack, carefully review all the
utensils that will go in your utility drawer. As
a rule, you should have two or three each of
everyday utensils (such as wooden spoons,
spatulas, and ladles) and no more than one
each of specialty items (such as a meat ten-
derizer, a garlic press, and a cheese slicer). If
you’re uncomfortable donating duplicate
utensils, consider creating a labeled “Kitchen
Box” in your long-term storage area (your
garage or attic, most likely). This box can
store your surplus can openers, whisks, and
the like, and when you’re in need of an item
or it’s time to replace one you’ve been using
regularly, you can start by shopping from
your “Kitchen Box.”

Hanging Stemware Racks
Unless you prefer stemless wine glasses, stemware racks are the way to go!
Hanging stemware racks are designed to maximize cabinet space and pro-
tect your precious stemware. Rails attached to the ceiling of the cabinet
have tracks to hold the base of each glass. One rack generally holds two to
four glasses, depending on the depth of your cabinet and the base size of
your stemware. Standard kitchen cabinets can hold two or three stemware
racks — that’s up to 12 glasses. Note that some units, like the one featured
in this installation, have several tracks attached to a single base. 
This project assumes that you’re installing the rack inside a cabinet and
attaching the rails to the top (ceiling) of the cabinet. See the tip at the end
of this project for installing a rack underneath a cabinet.
Place your rack inside your cabinet to plan your
installation. Add additional racks, as needed, to
store your collection of glasses. Make sure there’s
enough room to access the stemware on each rack.
If your stemware is very bulbous and the mouth is
much wider than the base, you need to locate the
racks farther apart so the glasses don’t touch.
Remember: Each cabinet is different, and you
should take into consideration the clearance of the
cabinet door, shelf supports, or other specific fea-
tures of your cabinet. While holding your rack in
place, make sure you can easily add and remove
your stemware.

Use a screwdriver to screw the rack in place, and
then fill the tracks with your stemware.
You can install stemware racks within a
cabinet, with the rails attached to the top
(ceiling) of the cabinet, or underneath a
kitchen cabinet, with the rails attached to
the underside (floor) of the cabinet. Both
surfaces are about 1⁄2 inch thick. Ensure that
the screws provided with your stemware
racks aren’t so long that they exceed the
thickness of the rack plus the ceiling or
floor of the cabinet.
If you choose to install stemware racks on
the underside of your kitchen cabinets
(above your countertops), note that the
frame of the cabinet may be thicker (and
therefore extend lower) than the underside
of the cabinet. In this case, locate your racks
far enough back from the front edge that
you can easily slide each glass out of the
rack without bumping the base into the
frame of the cabinet. I recommend setting
the front edge of the rack 4 inches back
from the frame.
Hold the rack up to the ceiling of your cabinet in
the location determined in Step 1 and mark the
screw holes with a pencil. If you’re using multiple
racks, leave at least 1⁄2 inch of space between racks
to easily slide the stemware in and out.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for your rack, drill holes
in the marked spots, applying consistent vertical
pressure.

Installing Pull-Out Bins for 
Garbage and Recycling
Pull-out bins are a great way to conceal garbage and recycling in a bottom
kitchen cabinet or underneath the kitchen sink if there’s room. They enable
you to hide your trash can when you’re entertaining but still access it
easily when preparing meals or doing other messy tasks.
Note: Measure the width, depth, and height of your available space before
you shop for bins. You need to find bins that fit within the dimension of the
cabinet, allowing at least 1-inch clearance on each side.

net, I recommend locating the edge of the frame
flush to one side of the cabinet. Use a measuring

wall; mark both the front and the back of the cabi-
net with a pencil to ensure that your frame will be
at an even distance from the side of the cabinet.

marks made in Step 1. Use your pencil to mark
through the holes in the frame to indicate where
you’ll drill your holes.

Pull-out bins are easy on the back because they enable you to access the entire contents of your cabinet (bins,
garbage bags, and so on) with little effort. No more bending and reaching to access the back of the cabinet!
Trays also hold the bin firmly in place to make emptying the trash much easier.They’re a great solution for the
disabled or elderly!

Hanging a Four-Chain, Ceiling-Mounted 
Pot Rack
A ceiling-mounted pot rack is both visually interesting and practical! Pots
and pans are bulky to store and pose a particular challenge if you have a
smaller kitchen with few cabinets. This project frees up tons of cabinet
space. The two main styles of support are two-chain (one at either end)
and four-chain (one at each corner). 
The trick to hanging a stable pot rack is supporting the substantial weight
of the loaded up rack from four equal lengths of chain. You attach each
chain from the pot rack to a ceiling joist at an outward angle. (Chapter 3
has an introduction to ceiling joists.) To promote stability, your chains
should form a rectangle that’s wider than the dimensions of the pot rack
itself. Angling the chains outward from the center of the pot rack also
reduces the amount of swing. This project details the installation of a 
four-chain, rectangular pot rack.
Before you do anything else, find a buddy to help.This project isn’t difficult,
but it requires some work on a ladder and heavy lifting.

Stuff You 
Need to Know

Climb your ladder and locate the joists in your
chosen location with a stud finder or alternative
technique. Mark them in pencil. For this installa-
tion, you need to determine which way the joists
run (north–south or east–west), and find two to
three joists. Ceiling joists are almost always
located 16 inches apart.
A bonus of a ceiling-mounted pot rack is
that it can really spruce up your kitchen’s
décor.Why not embellish your rack with
colorful cookware, silk plants, or decorative
baskets?
To promote stability, the four hooks installed in
the ceiling joists to hold the rack chains will form
a rectangle larger than the dimensions of the pot
rack itself. The desired location of your pot rack
dictates where you install the hanging hooks in
the joists.
Measure your pot rack, and transfer that measure-
ment to the ceiling in your desired location. Either
center the pot rack between the joists that you
marked in Step 2, or align the pot rack with the
joists. Starting from the corners of the pot rack
dimensions, move 6 inches outward along each
joist in either direction and mark these spots.
These are the spots where you’ll install your
hooks into the joists. You should have two pencil
marks along one joist and two pencil marks along
a second joist. The distance between the joist
marks should be wider than the pot rack itself. 
If you’re struggling with the measurements in this
step, you may want to cut out a rectangle the size
of the pot rack from newspaper and tape this
template to the ceiling. Then make all measure-
ments and marks from the corners of the paper
rectangle.
58

Connect chains to each corner hook on the pot
rack. Have someone help you connect each chain
to the joists’ hooks.
Adjust the hanging height of the rack. It should be
low enough for you to be able to get pots and pans
down but high enough to allow adults to walk
underneath it if it isn’t hanging over a kitchen
island. Check the height, and readjust which links
are on the hooks as needed. Then remove the extra
links one at a time by using a wire cutter or pliers.

Adding a Wall Rack for Cleaning Tools
Let’s face it — kitchens are messy! With all the food being prepared, served,
and consumed, drips, crumbs, and spills inevitably find their way onto the
floor. That’s why it’s convenient to have cleaning tools nearby in a hall closet
or pantry to tidy up.
Closets and pantries are tight spaces. Before you shop around for an appro-
priate rack, select the cleaning implements you plan to hang from it (brooms,
dust pans, mops, dusters), and measure the available vertical and horizontal
space. Verify that your location has enough height to house your tools and
that the width of the rack won’t interfere with a door or light switch.

If the rack will hold a significant amount of weight,
you should install it into one or more wall studs.
Use a stud finder to locate wall studs and mark
their location with a pencil.
Select the height of the wall rack. I recommend
hanging it about 60 inches from the floor to
accommodate the length of all your components,
and it should be at a convenient height for adults
to access. Measure 60 inches along the studs you
located in Step 1, and mark the height in pencil.

Tossing out those plastic storage containers
One of the most common kitchen organiza-
tion problems is trying to squeeze in too many
plastic storage containers! Throw out any con-
tainer that doesn’t have a functional lid, is
cracked, or is too bulky to store. I recommend
keeping three small round containers, three
small rectangular containers, and two large
containers. These items are for leftovers and
don’t deserve to take up more than one shelf
of valuable storage space!
A wall rack for cleaning tools is also a great
place to hang frequently used utility items
like flashlights.

Creating a Pantry
If you’re struggling to fit all your kitchen items into your kitchen cabinets,
consider converting empty wall space into a pantry by adding shelving.
Which type of shelving should you choose? Wire shelving (usually plastic-
coated) is a budget-friendly choice and provides the greatest visibility of
items. Wood shelving is a little tougher on the pocketbook, but it’s the
strongest option and gives your pantry a professional, clean look. 
Note: The two ways to install a shelving system are with or without a hori-
zontal support rail. The main benefit of a horizontal support rail is that you
install it and then hook vertical rails into it without further measurement or
installation. As long as vertical rails are installed level and at a consistent
height, horizontal support rails aren’t necessary, though. The drawbacks of
using the horizontal rails are that they add to the cost of the project, they
can’t be used with a sloped ceiling or sloped shelving configuration, and
they can give the project an industrial look. This particular project involves
shelving installation without horizontal support rails.
Measure the width, height, and depth of the wall space, and then purchase
metal rails up to 10 inches less than your vertical wall space. Shelves typi-
cally are 4 feet wide, and you need two rails to hold them. If you’re installing
extra-wide shelving (6 feet wide or more) or have extremely heavy storage
requirements, install three vertical metal rails to support the weight. Four-
foot shelves are relatively inexpensive, so I recommend using four to six
shelves to maximize your storage.

Need to Know

Use a stud finder to locate the wall studs. Use
your pencil and a level to mark at least two points
along one stud, for example, one at eye level and
one at knee level. These pencil marks will act as
visual cues when installing the metal rail into 
the wall stud, so spacing them a few feet apart 
is helpful. 
Move 16 inches left or right to locate a second
stud and make additional marks. Repeat again if
you need a third stud.
The benefit of shelving systems is that
you can completely customize them!
For example, if you want a 6-inch high
shelf to store several dozen baby food
jars, this system can accommodate
your needs.
Position the metal rails according to the preferred
height of your wall shelving (remembering that you
can adjust the height of each shelf based on where
it latches into the rails). The rails should be at
least 5 inches above your baseboards and at least
5 inches below the ceiling to allow for maximum
shelf storage. (This is where your ladder will come
in handy!) Use your pencil to mark the location of
the top of each metal rail along the wall stud.

Still holding the rail along the first wall stud at 
the height determined in Step 2, push a pencil
through three or four of the screw holes in the 
rail to indicate where you’ll drill into the stud. To
help you position additional rails, measure the
distance from the top of the baseboard to the
screw hole marks (for example, 12 inches, 36
inches, 60 inches, and 72 inches) and note these
measurements.
On the second wall stud that you located in Step 1,
start at the baseboard and measure up the wall
stud, marking spots to drill holes at identical
heights to your marks for the first rail from Step 3
(for example, 12 inches, 36 inches, 60 inches, and
72 inches). If your shelving will need to support
extremely heavy weight, repeat this process for a
third rail on a third wall stud.
Use a level to determine that the screw hole
marks for your metal rails are at the same height.

Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required to install the rails, drill
holes in the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
Align the metal rails with the drilled holes so that
the top of the rail is at the height determined in
Step 2, and insert the screws. Screw each one in
using a screwdriver.
Insert the shelving brackets into the notches 
in the metal rails, making sure to insert the
brackets for each shelf into identical height
notches on each rail. You can simply set wood 
or wire shelves onto the brackets or pop them
into place.
Wire baskets are great for organizing collec-
tions of small items like spices, seasoning
packets, and tea bags.Wire baskets gener-
ally hook directly into the rails.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling
Your Kitchen
After you outfit your kitchen to your liking, it’s time for the fun and easy part —
putting your kitchen back together! In this section, I explain where to stash all your
items for maximum ease of use, describe a few handy gadgets for organizing your
cabinets, and give you tips on grouping items in your pantry.
Keeping things close at hand
Do you wear a pedometer while preparing meals? Maybe you should! When prepar-
ing a meal, you constantly walk between the sink, the stove, and the refrigerator.
These three points form the kitchen triangle. Minimize extra steps by locating fre-
quently used items in the triangle. Here are some recommendations on placement:

Store daily-use plates, bowls, and cups in the upper cabinet closest to the
dishwasher to make loading and unloading a breeze. Likewise, silverware
goes in the drawer immediately under this cabinet.

Children’s items go in the lowest possible drawer so they can access them.

Dish towels and oven mitts should be in a drawer nearest to the cooktop
and oven.

Plastic food storage containers, foil, and plastic wrap should be located
near the refrigerator to facilitate quickly putting leftovers away.

Spices, oils, and vinegars should go in the cabinet nearest the stove. If this
location isn’t available, you can group these items in your pantry.
Surveying shelf stackers, china 
and lid racks, and Lazy Susans
When you return items to your cabinets, double-check that they truly support your
goal of a tidy, functional space. I recommend locating frequently used items, such as
plates and coffee mugs, on the lowest shelves of your upper cabinets. Move infre-
quently used items, such as small appliances and specialty or seasonal items, to the
higher shelves or lower cabinets. If your kitchen cabinets get crowded as you restock
them, the following solutions are inexpensive and require no installation:

Shelf stackers allow short items like coffee mugs and juice glasses to be
stacked on two different levels within one shelf. Shelf stackers are generally
constructed of a lightweight material like wire or plastic and resemble a
small shelf on legs. Short items fit under the shelf stacker as well as on top
of the shelf.

China racks serve a dual purpose of maximizing your cabinet storage and
protecting fragile dishes. A china rack is a sturdy wooden base with two
rows of pegs. You stand individual dishes between each set of pegs. If you
choose to stack your dishes rather than use a china rack, limit your stack 
67
Chapter 5: Decluttering Your Kitchen

to 8 to 12 dishes as not to damage the ones on the bottom of the stack, and
consider using a padded china storage set to protect your dishes from dust
and chipping.
A family can easily function with only two sets of dishes: everyday and
formal. Some families with enough storage may choose to store three sets of
dishes: everyday, formal, and holiday. Sets of dishes that are used less than
every other year should be donated or passed on to family members who
could use a new set of dishes. If you have fragile family heirloom dishes,
safely display them or relocate them to long-term storage.

Lid racks or lid organizers are invaluable for a crowded drawer of pots and
pans. A lid rack is a device similar to a china rack in that it allows you to
stack your pot and pan lids vertically and requires no installation. It’s con-
structed of a sturdy wood or wire base with pegs or dividers to separate
each lid. Generally, a lid rack is placed at the front of a deep drawer for pots
and pans or in an adjacent cabinet. You also can store cookie sheets, plat-
ters, and shallow pans in large lid racks.

A Lazy Susan is a rotating base on which you place a group of like items in a
tight space. The rotating feature allows you to access items from the back of
the cabinet quickly by spinning them to the front. An ideal location for a
Lazy Susan is in a pantry, where you can store a grouping of sauces, canned
foods, or condiments in limited space. Double-decker Lazy Susans are ideal
for storing a large collection of spices or vitamins. When serving a meal, use
a decorative Lazy Susan to hold salt, pepper, salad dressings, and sauces.
Grouping items in your pantry
An organized pantry can significantly reduce your meal preparation time because
you’re able to find what you need quickly and easily. If your pantry has at least four
shelves, the following is a suggested grouping by shelf:

Shelf 1 (highest): NON-FOOD ITEMS (vitamins, cookbooks, recipe cards);
SUPPLIES (paper towels, rags, cleaning supplies)
To protect young children and pets, keep potentially hazardous items like
vitamins, cleaning supplies, and items in childproof containers on the 
highest shelf.

Shelf 2 (close to eye level): BAKING (flour, sugar, salt, cake mixes, icing,
decorations); SAUCES (sauces, unopened salad dressings, condiments)

Shelf 3 (below eye-level): DRY FOODS (cereal, rice, pasta, bread, pancake
mix); COFFEE/TEA (coffee beans, tea bags, sugar, sweetener, honey)

Shelf 4 (lowest): CANNED FOODS (vegetables, fruits); TREATS & SNACKS
(cookies, candies, chips, crackers)
Every household functions differently. Ensure that you’re taking your preferences
(perhaps a daily vitamin taker) and situations (such as young children in the home)
into consideration before determining your shelving arrangement.
Add inconspicuous clear labels to the shelves to help you and your family stay on
track. You’ll find that if a shelf is labeled “CANNED FOODS,” you’re less likely to
squeeze a box of pasta into this space. It’s also a good exercise for children, who
learn to put items in the labeled space.

our bedroom is the first thing you see in the morning and the
last thing you see before you fall asleep. It’s your personal
sanctuary, separated from the chaos of your household. Or is it?
Give your bedroom the priority attention it deserves! Having an organ-
ized bedroom and a streamlined closet saves you valuable time get-
ting dressed in the morning and will energize you to take on the day.
Thoughtful storage options for your clothing make it easier to main-
tain your system going forward, too.
The bedroom is a major workhorse of your home, so make it work for
you. Begin by setting a realistic goal of how you want your bedroom to
function. Ideally, your bedroom should be a blissful space free of clut-
ter, work, and projects that allows you to relax. Bedrooms, however,
often have limitations such as small size, multiple functions, or
improper storage. This chapter helps you make the most of the space
and storage you do have and provides clever solutions for additional
storage. If your space serves a dual function, such as that of bed-
room/home office or bedroom/workout room, I recommend you move the second-
ary activity elsewhere. There must be somewhere else to store your laptop (see
Chapter 8 for home office ideas)!
The goal of a bedroom closet is a visually pleasing and organized space that stores
all your clothing, shoes, and accessories. If your closet is properly organized, getting
dressed should be simple — and fun! Bedroom closets come in a wide spectrum of
sizes — but don’t worry, you can transform even the smallest closet into a hard-
working space that meets your goal! When you’re assessing your space, consider the
limitations of your closet by answering these questions:

Is your closet large enough for all your clothing? If not, do you have too
many clothes?

Does your closet lack shelving?

Does your closet have enough hanging space for long and short items?

Do you have enough storage for your shoes? If not, do you have too many
shoes?

Do you have sufficient bins, shelves, and hooks for your accessories?

Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 
There’s nothing like a fresh start when organizing a space! Begin by removing every-
thing from your bedroom and closet. Yes, everything! This crucial step allows you to
assess what you have and quickly eliminate items that don’t support your goal or
aren’t mindful of the limitations of your room and closet. It’s time to sort your items!
Divide your items into four large containers labeled as follows:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the bedroom or closet. For the bedroom, this means furni-
ture that’s appropriately sized for your space, fits your needs, and is in
good condition. (Obviously you won’t be able to fit furniture in the STAY
container, but you get the idea.) For the closet, this means clothes that you
love and wear often.

MOVE: This item doesn’t belong in your bedroom (such as exercise equip-
ment and work projects), or it needs to be removed from the bedroom until
it has been fixed (think broken furniture). Likewise, items in the closet (such
as memorabilia, electronics, and photos) need to be returned to their
proper rooms or removed until they’re repaired (such as stained, torn, 
or ill-fitting clothing).

SHARE: This item is in good condition but no longer serves the goal, so you
should share it! For the bedroom, this includes extra pieces of furniture or
accessories that are just cluttering up the space. For the closet, you should
donate items that you haven’t worn in 12 months. Examples of items to share
are those that you don’t wear anymore (like last year’s jeans or business
clothing that’s too formal for your work environment), items that don’t fit
(like skinny jeans or maternity clothes), and items that are outdated (like
your college jeans).

GO: This item is trash — don’t even try to donate this junk! Examples
include items that are permanently stained, worn out, or beyond repair. If
you wouldn’t pass it on to a loved one or friend, you shouldn’t donate it!
Creating a soothing atmosphere in your bedroom
These décor do’s and don’ts help keep your
eyes on the prize: a bedroom that you want
to spend time in!
 Do incorporate a wide variety of textures
in your room. For example, a shaggy
throw rug, velvety drapes, and fringed
throw pillows add layers of interest and
warmth to your space.
 Do set up a radio, CD player, or MP3
player to help you achieve bliss through
soothing classical or instrumental back-
ground music at the touch of a button.
 Do make your bed each day. At the end
of a long day, you’ll return to your bed-
room with a smile!
 Do add scent to your bedroom. Scented
candles or essential oil diffusers can
instantly transform your mood through
aromatherapy. For example, lavender is
relaxing, peppermint is energizing, and
sage is sensual.
 Don’t leave any clothing, shoes, or laun-
dry on the floor. Clothing clutter is dis-
tracting and doesn’t enhance your
bedroom bliss. If you don’t have time to
put away your clothing before you rush
out the door, at least get it into the
closet.

Prepare a well-ventilated painting area (like a
garage with the door open) by laying down drop-
cloths or newspaper to protect the workspace.
1
Use a stir stick to completely mix the paint or stain
you plan to use on the round piece of wood that will
be your nightstand top. Use a paintbrush or sponge
brush to apply the paint or stain to the wood. Wipe
off the excess paint or stain as needed, and let the
wood dry completely. (You may need to apply one
to two coats to achieve your desired look.)
2
Every bedroom has a bed, but does every bedroom have a nightstand? An
essential yet often overlooked piece of furniture, a nightstand is a surface to
stow a book or a pair of reading glasses, set a glass of water, or situate a
reading lamp and an alarm clock. This project is a fun and inexpensive way
to create a nightstand out of common household items. I recommend using a
sturdy trash can (either round or square) as the base and a piece of wood
(with a larger diameter than the base) as the top. Then pick a fabric to dis-
guise the base; I recommend selecting a neutral fabric that doesn’t compete
with your bedding, and use one that’s lightweight, like cotton, but substan-
tial enough to disguise the base!

Use a flexible measuring tape to measure the
perimeter of your base (the distance around the
outside edge). Add 4 inches to this measurement
to determine the length of your fabric.
Measure the height of the base of your table, from
the floor to the top edge. Add 2 inches to this
measurement to determine the width of your
fabric.
Use a flexible measuring tape and a piece of chalk
to mark your fabric with the measurements from
Steps 3 and 4. You’ll wrap the nightstand base in a
single rectangular piece of fabric.
Use fabric scissors to cut the fabric to size along
your chalk line from Step 5. (Fabric scissors give
you a crisp, clean cut through fabric.)
Create a 1⁄2-inch fold at the top edge of the length
side of the fabric (the side that corresponds to
the perimeter plus 4 inches). Iron this fold to
create a crisp edge. Repeat on the opposite side 
of the fabric, ironing a 1⁄2-inch fold along the bottom
edge of the length.

Turn your trash can base upside down so the open
end is facing down. Starting anywhere along the
edge of the top of the base, use a hot glue gun to
glue the ironed hem of your fabric to the base to
create a fabric skirt around your base. Proceed to
glue the ironed hem of the fabric around the entire
perimeter of the base, and overlap the remaining 4
inches to create a flap to allow you to access any
hidden lower storage (see the tip at the end of this
project). The fabric should be glued to the base
only along the top edge of the base.
If you want the wood top permanently attached to
the base, add a few small beads of hot glue to the
perimeter edge of the top of the base, and then
quickly position the wood on the base. (You also
can use double-sided adhesive foam squares for a
light hold.)

Coloring your closet
If you ever find yourself with a completely
empty closet, make the most of this unique
situation and transform your closet space
with paint.
 For a calm feeling, try light blues or
greens.
 To feel energized, try a spicy orange,
magenta, or turquoise.
 For a traditional feel, stick to neutral
beige or gray tones.
 Consider adding wallpaper to a single
wall to create a boutique look!
Interested in other options for your nightstand base and top? If you’re looking for concealed lower storage, I
suggest using a collection of plastic crates turned on their sides as your base; if you want a pedestal-style table,
choose an attractive garden planter, large vase, or urn. If the base is attractive, you don’t need a fabric cover for
the base. Options for your top include a decorative piece of wood, a wrought-iron trivet, a round piece of glass,
or a colorful ceramic platter.You have to get creative when attaching the base to the top; depending on the top
you select, you can use hot glue, gorilla glue, screws, or putty.

Wall-mounted closet racks are a simple way to organize your accessories,
clothing, and hats. Closet racks tend to be more decorative — like wrought-
iron or painted wood — rather than utilitarian because they usually only
hold a collection of lighter items like scarves or belts. Use one or more
racks to maximize accessory storage along the wall of your closet or in the
often overlooked wall space behind your closet door. 
Determine the location of your rack. Ideally, you
should hang it at eye level or above so that it can
hold longer, floor-length items. Measure the height
on the wall with a measuring tape and mark it with
a pencil.

Hold the rack to the wall at your selected height,
and push a pencil through the screw holes of the
hanging mechanism to show you where to drill
holes.
Use a level on the hole marks to ensure that the
rack will hang level.

Why stop at clothes? With proper planning, your bedroom closet can store
your clothes, shoes, scarves, belts, hats, and jewelry! The back of the closet
door is often unclaimed real estate and an ideal spot to locate an accessories
organizer. 
Before you run out and buy your components, identify the items you want
to store on your organizer; good candidates are hats, scarves, belts, ties,
bangle bracelets, bandanas, and even boas! Sort your accessories into
groups to determine the number and type of hanging mechanisms you
need. Purchase racks and hooks that are the right size for each group of
accessories. Decorative racks less than 24 inches wide are best for holding
a collection of items like scarves or belts; you drill holes and screw them
directly into the door. Door hooks can be hung over the door (no installa-
tion), twisted in, or stuck on with adhesive, and they’re best for short 
or lightweight individual items like baseball caps or bracelets. Because
accessories tend to be lightweight, you can purchase plastic hooks
(reserve the heavy-duty hooks for garage or entryway use). Hangers
designed to hold belts or ties can be mounted to the back of the door 
and are an excellent solution for holding long items.

Determine the vertical layout of your organizer
based on the items each element will hold: Items
that are short and a consistent length (like bangle
bracelets or hats) should be located highest on
the door. Items that are long and vary in size (like
scarves or belts) should be located lowest on the
door. Just be sure that your lowest items won’t
drag on the floor every time you open and close
the door.
To create a visually pleasing organizer, use a meas-
uring tape to center each hanging mechanism on
the door. If you’re attaching an even number of
components, such as two adhesive hooks, use
your measuring tape to hang these the same
distance from the center of the door to create a
uniform look. Mark each location in pencil.
Starting with the highest group, hold up your rack
and use a pencil to mark through the screw holes.
Repeat this step for components that you’ll place
on lower parts of the door.
If you’re screwing a rack into the door, fit your
drill with a drill bit with a slightly smaller diame-
ter than the screws required to mount the rack.
Also, the drill bit shouldn’t be longer than the
door is thick, or you’ll end up with holes straight
through your door. 
Drill holes in the marked spots for screwed-in
racks, applying consistent horizontal pressure.

You’ve put on your slacks, your blouse, your jacket, and your shoes. But are you dressed? Adding accessories like
belts and scarves is the fun part! Accessories often are stashed in boxes in the far recesses of closets, making
them difficult to access daily.A big perk of an organizer is that you can view your entire collection of accessories
at once and easily select the right piece for your outfit.

Shoes are no longer just mere footwear. If you are a woman, are married to a
woman, or have ever met a woman, there’s a very good chance you under-
stand what I’m talking about. Shoes are expensive! They deserve to be off
the floor of your closet and on a pedestal . . . or at least on a wall-mounted
shoe rack! This is a simple project that will make you — or the woman in
your life — very, very happy. You create a wall-mounted shelving system
from two vertical metal rails, brackets that snap in place, and several rows
of wood shelving. (Similar shelving systems for heavier items, like those in
garages or pantries, may require more than two vertical support rails.)
Before you shop for supplies and begin installation, measure the wall space
you have in your closet and determine the number of shelves you need or
can accommodate. You need at least 24 inches of available width; a 24-inch
shelf holds three to four pairs of shoes, and a 36-inch shelf holds five to six
pairs. As for height, your metal rails should be at least 5 inches above your
baseboards and at least 5 inches lower than the ceiling to accommodate
shoes while maximizing shelf storage. Plan different shelf heights for flats
(position shelves about 6 inches apart) and heels (position shelves about 
10 inches apart), and for tall footwear like boots, you may want to keep them
on the floor and place the lowest shelf at a height of 18 inches or more.

Locate a wall stud in your chosen location with a
stud finder. Use your level and a pencil to mark
the stud at a minimum of two heights — maybe
knee height and eye level. These marks will help
you position the vertical metal rail along the 
wall stud.
Measure and move 16 inches to either side to
locate a second stud (they’re usually 16 inches
apart). Repeat Step 1 on this stud.
Position the first metal rail vertically along one
wall stud at the desired height. Position your 
level alongside the rail to verify that it’s exactly
vertical.

If your shoes are in various locations throughout your closet — or worse, multiple closets throughout your house —
remembering exactly what you own can be challenging.You’re likely to forget you own a certain pair (like red flats)
and may end up buying a replacement pair you don’t need! Shoe shelving in your closet lets you consolidate your
collection and select the right pair for any outfit.

Use your pencil to mark through the screw holes in
the rail to indicate where you’ll drill your holes.
These marks don’t correspond to the height of the
shelves; they’re merely to screw the rail to the wall
stud. Repeat with the second metal rail, marking
through the same screw holes as on the first rail.
Use a level to verify that the screw hole marks
from Step 4 are at consistent heights. This is very
important because level vertical rails ensure that
you have level shelves!
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the vertical rails,
drill holes in all the marked spots, applying con-
sistent horizontal pressure.
Align the holes in the metal rail with the drilled
holes, and screw the rail in with a screwdriver.
Repeat for the second rail.
Insert the shelving brackets into the notches in
the metal rails, making sure that you use the same
notches in both rails.
Set wood shelves onto the brackets or pop them
into place. (If your shelving system has wire
shelves, this step should be the same.)

It’s time to make some decisions for your closet organization . . . namely, one
rod or two? For maximum storage, consider using a double rod, which con-
sists of a short low rod and a full-length high rod. This configuration allows
full-length garments to hang from the part of the high rod that extends
beyond the shorter low rod. The low rod needs to be high enough that shirts
and skirts don’t skim the floor; I recommend 38 to 40 inches from the floor.
The high rod should be hung at twice the height of the low rod to allow
shirts and skirts enough clearance from the low rod; I recommend 76 to 
80 inches from the floor. You’re free to experiment with different heights 
that work for your closet.
In this project, the high rod is the same length as the back wall of the closet
and is installed directly into the side walls using sockets. This type of rod
can be expandable or cut to fit the length of the back wall. If the rod is longer
than 4 feet, you need brackets in the middle of the rod to distribute the
weight. I recommend adding a support bracket every 16 or 32 inches in
order to hit wall studs.
In this project, the low rod spans about half the length of the back wall of
the closet and connects to the wall with a socket on one end. The low rod
needs to be suspended by brackets that support the middle of the bar and
the end that isn’t installed into a side wall socket. I recommend adding a
support bracket every 16 or 32 inches in order to hit wall studs.

Identify the desired height of your clothing rods.
You should select a height between 38 inches
(minimum for a low rod) and 80 (maximum for a
high rod), making sure that you can reach to get
clothes on and off the high rod in particular. Use a
pencil to mark the wall in several locations at
your desired heights.
Make the most of your closet space by
grouping like items together, using uniform
hangers and leaving space between each
item (see the later section “The Finishing
Touches: Reassembling Your Bedroom and
Closet” for details). If your clothing is still
packed together too tightly, consider adding
another clothing rod.
Locate a wall stud on the back wall of your closet
with a stud finder, and mark it with a pencil.
(Chapter 3 tells you how to find a wall stud.)
Move 16 inches to either side to locate and mark
an additional stud. Repeat along the span of the
closet wall.

Determine the locations of your brackets on the
wall studs at both high (rod) and low (rod) levels.
Hold each bracket against the wall and use a
pencil to mark the screw holes so that you know
where to drill holes for mounting the bracket.
Note: Clothing rods are weighed down with cloth-
ing, and additional brackets are necessary to sup-
port the weight of closet rods longer than 4 feet.
Remember that wall studs are located at 16-inch
intervals, so your brackets should be located
every 16 or 32 inches.
Use your level to verify that all pencil marks are
level for both the high rod and the low rod.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for your brackets, drill
holes in all the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
Align the screw holes in the brackets with the
holes in the wall, and use a screwdriver to screw
your brackets into the wall.

Temporarily place the high clothing rod on its
brackets so you can see exactly where the sockets
should be positioned on the adjacent walls. Trace
around the rod where it meets the side walls.
Remove the high clothing rod so you can install
your sockets. Hold each socket in place (where
you traced the rod in Step 8), and mark the 
screw holes in the sockets so you know where 
to drill holes.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the sockets, drill holes in 
the marked spots, applying consistent horizontal
pressure.
Align the screw holes in the sockets with the holes
in the wall, and use a screwdriver to screw your
sockets in the wall, positioning them with the
opening facing upward. This open-ended design
allows you to easily lower the rod into the socket.
Install your high clothing rod by lowering it into
the sockets.
Repeat Steps 8 through 12 to install the lower
clothing rod. Note that the lower clothing rod only
spans a portion of the wall and is supported by a
wall socket at one end and a bracket at the other.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Bedroom and Closet
Pat yourself on the back because the hard work is done: Your wardrobe is stream-
lined, and your bedroom and closet boast plenty of new storage options. All that’s
left are the finishing touches. This section presents some easy and rewarding solu-
tions to give your space a polished look.
Storing items under the bed
If you’re sleeping on a king-size bed that measures 76 inches by 80 inches and is
approximately 9 inches off the floor, you have more than 31 square feet of unused
storage underneath your bed! The space underneath the bed is often underutilized,
so check out some ways to make the most of your newfound space:

Bed risers: Bed risers can elevate your bed an additional 6 inches — creat-
ing an additional 21 square feet of storage space! Purchase an extra long
bedskirt to hide unsightly storage down below.

Storage containers: For customized storage, you can build wood boxes on
wheels (detailed in Chapter 9). Otherwise, you can purchase under-the-bed
containers in varying sizes and made of a variety of materials like plastic or
canvas. Prevent damage from moths and mildewing by storing infrequently
used or delicate items in plastic zippered bags.
• For a carpeted bedroom, I recommend purchasing several plastic under-
the-bed boxes.
• For hardwood or laminate floors, I recommend purchasing fabric or
canvas storage containers that won’t scratch your flooring.

Arrangement of storage containers: Play around with the arrangement of
multiple storage boxes under the bed to maximize the space. Store fre-
quently used items (such as extra sheet sets) under the perimeter of the
bed and seasonal items (such as bulky winter sweaters or blankets) toward
the middle of the space. Hide holiday or birthday presents for young kids in
the center area where they’ll be hidden by the perimeter storage and harder
for curious little ones to access.
Dresser drawer do’s and don’ts
When properly organized, dresser drawers can store a ton of clothing and acces-
sories! One perk of using drawers is that items like t-shirts or tank tops never fall off
hangers and end up in a wrinkled pile on the floor of your closet. Another perk is
that you can neatly tuck an entire collection of items, like exercise wear, into a single
drawer. Follow this list of do’s and don’ts to make the most of the drawer space you
do have:
86
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 


Do store all non-hanging items in your drawers. These items include
undergarments, nylons, slips, socks, pajamas, exercise wear, bathing suits,
and casual t-shirts.

Do dedicate each drawer to a type of clothing. If you have several small
drawers at the top of your dresser, you can assign them socks, undergar-
ments, nylons and slips, and swimwear. If you only have large drawers, you
can use vertical drawer dividers to separate one drawer into several sec-
tions. Drawer dividers are wood or plastic vertical slats that expand to fit
your drawers; you can purchase them at large home stores and organization
stores.

Do use drawer nooks to organize smaller items like socks or undergar-
ments. Drawer nooks use a grid to divide an individual drawer into 12 to 20
squares. You can purchase drawer nooks at large home stores and organiza-
tion stores.

Do keep clothing in neat stacks to maximize drawer space. A narrow
drawer (perhaps about 15 inches wide) may hold only one stack of folded
items, like t-shirts, whereas a standard drawer (about 30 inches) may hold
two stacks and an extra wide drawer (more than 40 inches) three stacks of
clothing.

Do add fragrance sachets, cedar chips, or scented drawer liners to keep
your drawers and their contents smelling fresh!

Don’t try to store jeans or slacks in your dresser drawers. Adult pants are
very bulky, and a few pairs will fill an entire drawer! Instead, purchase spe-
cialty hangers that efficiently hang up to five pants on a single hanger (see
the later section “Arranging your clothes neatly”).

Don’t store non-clothing items such as books, memorabilia, and toiletries
in your dresser drawers. Dresser drawer space is valuable and should be
reserved for clothing!

Don’t overstuff your drawers! If a drawer can’t easily slide in and out, the
top item of clothing will stick and topple over your tidy stacks of clothing.
Hanging ties and belts
If you haven’t already committed to hanging your ties and belts on wall hooks or
racks, for under $10 you can purchase tie/belt hangers that store your ties and belts
vertically in small or large groups (see Figure 6-1).
These clever devices were designed to store ties and belts, but you can also use
them for the following items:

Scarves and wraps

Necklaces and bracelets

Nightgowns and slips
87
Chapter 6: Blissful Bedrooms and Cleansed Closets

Figure 6-1: Tie and belt hangers keep your accessories organized.
Arranging your clothes neatly
Coordinated hangers provide a pleasing order to your closet as well as ensure that
there’s enough space between items for them to hang properly. You can purchase
inexpensive matching plastic hangers at large discount stores or opt for more expen-
sive wooden or fabric-lined hangers.
Instead of throwing them away, return all your wire hangers to your local dry cleaner.
They’ll appreciate it, and you’ll be doing something good for the environment!
Home organization stores and Web sites also offer specialty hangers to capture just
about any type of clothing imaginable. Try these options (and check out Figure 6-2):

If your clothing rod space is at a premium, tiered specialty hangers (with or
without clips) are a great solution. They group items together vertically, so
one hanger can support five to seven pants or skirts. Think of the valuable
inches of hanging space you’ll save.

An open-ended hanger provides one open end for easy removal of dress
slacks, shawls, and wraps. This is a great solution for frequent travelers
because they can pack several pairs of slacks at a time without removing a
single hanger from the closet rod.
88
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 

Figure 6-2: Specialty hangers help you organize your clothing and save space.
Another trick of the trade is to present clothing in a manner that’s both pleasing to
the eye and facilitates finding the item you want. Group all your hanging items by
type. To be more specific, order them as follows from left to right:

Coats, casual

Chapter 6: Blissful Bedrooms and Cleansed Closets

If you want to further customize your hanging clothes, you can organize each sub-
group by color. Organization is addictive, isn’t it?
After you’ve grouped your clothing, why not try clothing dividers to keep everything
separate? Clothing dividers are white plastic discs that you place on your closet
rods (see Figure 6-3). They’re extremely inexpensive and sold at home organization
stores. Like labels on storage boxes, they provide a constant reminder of where each
item belongs and will help keep your system intact. There’s nothing more frustrating
than taking the time to set up an organizational system only to have to redo it
months later!
Figure 6-3: Distinguish groups of clothing with dividers.
People think they wear all the clothes in their closet when really only about 30 to 50
percent is worn regularly. Don’t worry; I can help! Group all your shirts together in
your closet, and then after wearing a shirt, return it to the far right of the group. Over
time, all your favorite shirts will naturally move to the right, and all those shirts not
being worn will remain on the left. You’ll be able to pare down your wardrobe by
searching from left to right. Employ this process with the other items in your closet
for optimal results.

athrooms aren’t large in volume, but they have to store large
volumes of stuff! Often your current storage is maxed out 
and you need clever organizational solutions for storing bathroom
necessities. The projects in this chapter focus on eliminating counter 
clutter, efficiently organizing drawers, and wall-mounting as much 
as possible!
A typical bathroom has makeup, toiletries, toothbrushes, towels, and
clutter covering the counter. Get that stuff up, off, and away! The goal
in this chapter is to make your daily prep time in your bathroom as
productive as possible by having all your storage up on the walls, all
your clutter off the counter, and all your counter clutter put away.
You’ll love the results.
The biggest limitation of a bathroom is obvious — its small size. But
overcoming this limitation is easy with storage mounted on the walls.
Wall-mounted storage increases the square footage of your bathroom by reducing
the footprint of armoires or storage towers. The footprint is simply the square footage
of floor space that an item occupies. For example, a 2-x-3-foot storage armoire in the
bathroom takes up about 6 square feet of usable floor space, whereas a wall-mounted
cabinet above the toilet doesn’t take up any usable floor space! In a small space like a
bathroom, every inch counts.
After you know your bathroom’s goal and limitations, you need to assess its con-
tents. Begin by emptying all cabinets and drawers and collecting counter clutter.
This step allows you to evaluate the contents of your bathroom and toss anything
that doesn’t belong. Sort your trove of toiletries and treasures into four large con-
tainers labeled:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and should stay in the bathroom. Examples include toiletries, cosmetics,
cleaning supplies, and bathroom linens.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and is used often, but it doesn’t
belong in the bathroom. Examples are electronics, clothing, and tools.


SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the room’s goal. Examples include out-
dated jewelry, unopened beauty products, extra hair styling tools, and
gently used linens.

GO: Dump it! Examples are expired cosmetics, beauty products you don’t
like or use, and broken items.
After you sort your bathroom’s contents, choose the projects that will help you
effectively store what’s in the “STAY” container, and get to work! When you’re done,
check out the section “The Finishing Touches: Reassembling Your Bathroom” at the
end of this chapter for ideas on keeping your bathroom tidy.
Lookin’ good: Organizing your makeup
Face it: Appearance is important! On aver-
age, people spend close to an hour every day
selecting clothing, styling hair, and applying
makeup. The easiest way to streamline this
process is to whittle your makeup supply
down to a reasonably sized collection of
items that are used regularly and in good
condition. In my experience, women have a
hard time letting go of makeup, so I offer
some advanced sorting guidelines to shave
valuable minutes off your morning routine:
 Throw away anything that you don’t
wear or don’t like.
 Discard any product that has been used
down to the nub. Buy a new one if you
like it so much!
 Any makeup from back in the day has to
go (you know what I mean — iridescent
blue eye shadow, creamsicle-orange lip-
stick, and the like).
 Follow the tips at beauty.about.com/
od/makeuptrickstips/a/shelflife.
htm and throw away any makeup that’s
past its expiration date, as follows:
• Mascara: 4 months
• Foundation and concealer: 1 year
• Nail polish: 1 year
• Eye liner and lip liner: 3 years
• Lipstick: 2 years
• Eye shadow: 3 years
After you’ve gone through your makeup,
purchase a cosmetics organizer for your
drawer. These organizers are generally
made of acrylic or plastic and have several
divided compartments (in different sizes
and shapes) to organize your products.
Group like items together based on what
you use them on or for:
 Lips: Lipstick, lip liner, lip gloss
 Eyes: Eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara
 Face: Lotion, foundation, concealer, blush,
powder
 Tools: Tweezers, brushes, sharpeners

Scented candles and soft classical music. A glass of wine. A soak in a

leisurely bath, reach for your crumpled, moist bathrobe on the floor . . .
wait a minute!
If you want a wrinkle-free, dry, cozy robe (and who doesn’t?), a wall-
mounted hook is the solution! No bathroom is complete without a sturdy
hook for bath towels and robes. Thick, absorbent fabrics like terry cloth
can add a lot of weight to a hook, so I recommend that you install hooks
into wall studs.

Determine where to hang your hook, and use a
measuring tape to verify that your chosen spot is
high enough that your towels and robe won’t
brush the floor. I recommend hanging your hook
at least 65 inches off the floor to accommodate a
full-length robe or nightgown.
Locate a wall stud with a stud finder. Mark the
stud with a pencil at the height determined in
Step 1.

Do you have a bad back? Using wall-mounted devices like wall hooks can help you keep items at arm’s length.
(You also can transfer frequently used items from lower cabinets to upper cabinets to prevent excessive bending.)

Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for your hook, drill
holes in the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
Screw your hook into the wall with a screwdriver.
Hold the hook up to the wall stud, and use a
pencil to mark the location of the holes you need
to drill by sticking the pencil through the screw
holes.
Use a level to make sure the holes you’ve marked
are level. Single hooks usually have two horizon-
tal holes, and double hooks usually have two ver-
tical holes. Turn your level horizontally or
vertically as needed to check your marks.

Stuff You Need to
Know
Determine the location and height of your towel bar. If you plan to hang bath towels on the bar,
hang it as close to the shower as possible to reduce dripping on your floor. If you plan to hang hand
towels on the bar, hang it as close to the sink as possible. The standard height of towel bars in new
homes is 48 inches off the floor, but you can tailor this height to fit the needs of your household.
1
Every bathroom in your home is probably already equipped with at least
one towel bar. If this bar is working overtime by holding towels for multiple
people, why not install another? Alternatively, you can give your space an
inexpensive lift by upgrading all the towel racks.
Locate the wall studs with a stud finder, and mark
them with a pencil.
2

Use a measuring tape and pencil to mark the
height of the towel bar along the stud.
Hold the towel bar up to the wall at the height
determined in Step 3 so that one hanging mecha-
nism is over a stud (see the tip at the end of this
project), and use a pencil to lightly trace around
both hanging mechanisms. 
Note: You can’t mark the exact screw holes yet
because they’re concealed by the towel bar. This
step is to determine the spacing of the hanging
mechanisms.
Use your level to check the pencil marks made in
Step 4 to ensure that your towel bar will hang
level.
Detach the hanging mechanisms from the towel
bar with a screwdriver. Hold one hanging mecha-
nism to the wall in the spot marked in Step 4, and
mark the screw holes with a pencil. Start with the
mechanism that aligns with a stud.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the hanging mecha-
nism, drill holes in the marked spots, applying
consistent horizontal pressure.

Use a screwdriver to screw the first hanging
mechanism into the stud.
Hold the second hanging mechanism to the wall
in the spot marked in Step 4, and mark the screw
holes with a pencil. Drill holes in the marked
spots, applying consistent horizontal pressure.
If your holes in Step 9 aren’t drilled into wall
studs, insert drywall anchors to strengthen the
installation. Simply position the drywall anchor in
the predrilled hole and tap with a hammer until
the anchor is almost completely in the hole.
Use a screwdriver to screw the second hanging
mechanism into the drywall anchors if you used
them. Otherwise screw into the predrilled holes in
the wall stud.

A new towel bar doesn’t need to be the same exact model as other towel bars in the bathroom, but try sticking
with the same type of finish (such as brass, nickel, black, white, or oak).

Use a small screwdriver to firmly screw the towel
bar to the hanging mechanisms.
Because of the towel bar width and stud
spacing, you may not be able to mount both
hanging mechanisms into studs; getting one
into a stud and one into drywall will suffice
as long as you use drywall anchors.
However, if the second hanging mechanism
is located exactly 16 inches away from the
first one, you can mount both mechanisms
into studs and eliminate the need for dry-
wall anchors.

Chapter 7: Up, Off, and Away! Organizing Your Bathroom
Bed, bath, and beyond! Organizing your linen closet
Linen closets are usually located near bath-
rooms, laundry rooms, and bedrooms. If
you’re lucky enough to have one (or more
than one, which would be really lucky), this
space acts as a home for all your bed and
bath linens and frees up your bedroom clos-
ets for storing clothing. If roomy enough, a
linen closet can also store table linens, beach
towels, and sleeping bags. And if yours is
located on a different floor than your garage,
it may also be a great spot to store a small
collection of utility items (the following list
has some examples). Remember: Protect
infrequently used items by placing them in
garment bags or zipped plastic storage bags
before you store them.
As a general rule, linen closet storage is
structured by shelf height and by item size.
For this purpose, I assume you’re facing a
linen closet with five shelves at fixed
heights. If you have adjustable shelves, feel
free to reconfigure to your exact needs!
 Shelf 1 (highest shelf):This shelf is slightly
hard to reach, so it’s a great place to stash
a box of utility items, such as flashlights,
batteries, replacement light bulbs, a fire
extinguisher, candles, matches, and a
rope ladder for emergencies.
 Shelf 2 (close to eye level): Upper
shelves often don’t provide as much
height as other shelves, making them
ideal for storing flat, stackable items
such as tablecloths, table runners, and
cloth napkins.
 Shelf 3 (chest height): This is the most
convenient shelf to load and unload and
as such should hold frequently used
items — bed sheets, pillowcases, hand
towels, and washcloths.
 Shelf 4 (waist height): Mid-level shelves
tend to be spacious and can accommo-
date bulky items, such as large bath
towels and comforters.
 Shelf 5 (lowest shelf):The lowest shelf is
the largest and should be reserved for
seasonal items or bulky items — beach
towels, holiday linens, heavy blankets,
and sleeping bags.

Stuff You Need to
Know
Determine how many shelves you want to hang and the location of
your wall shelving. Keep in mind that shelves add visual interest
over a towel bar, bath tub, or toilet. If you choose to hang more
than one shelf, I recommend purchasing identical shelves for a
streamlined look (and to make installation easier).
1
Every room in your home should have a balance of function and fun.
Bathrooms tend to be high on the “function” end of the spectrum because
they have to store all the items dedicated to health, beauty, and bathing.
Often the “fun” gets overlooked! You can carve out a few square feet of “fun”
by adding whimsical shelves on your bathroom walls or over the toilet.
Fill up your collection of wall shelves with lightweight fun items that reflect
your personality — perhaps ocean-inspired pieces like sea glass, starfish,
and driftwood; black-and-white photos of children or grandchildren . . . in
the bath (think bubbles!); treasured collections of glass boxes, antiques,
and porcelain figurines; or silly items like a collection of rubber ducks.

Arrange the grouping of shelves in a formation on
the floor in order to help you visualize their design
on the wall. If you want to create a staggered
effect, measure and write down the vertical and
horizontal distance between each shelf (for exam-
ple, “Shelf 2 is 6 inches down and 4 inches to the
left of Shelf 1”). 
Note: All measurements should be made from the
hanging mechanisms of one shelf to the hanging
mechanisms of the next in order to tell you where
to drill holes for each shelf.
Hold the highest shelf in your design up to the
wall. Mark the locations of the hanging mecha-
nisms in pencil. (A second pair of hands may
come in handy here.)
Use your measurements from Step 2 to determine
where to hang your second shelf. For example,
measure 6 inches down and then 4 inches to the
left of your marks in Step 3, and mark the spots
with a pencil. These spots correspond to the
hanging mechanisms of the shelf because
they’re derived from the hanging mechanisms
of the first shelf. Repeat this step for any addi-
tional shelves.
Because decorative shelves are generally
lightweight and don’t hold particularly
heavy items, locating a wall stud isn’t
required for this project.
101

Use a level to double-check all pencil marks for all
shelves. Adjust your marks as needed.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the hanging mecha-
nism, drill holes in the marked spots for all the
shelves by applying consistent horizontal pres-
sure to each hole.
Add drywall anchors to each drilled hole to rein-
force the strength of the installation. Simply posi-
tion the drywall anchor in the predrilled hole and
tap it with a hammer until the anchor is almost
completely in the hole.
Use your screwdriver to attach the highest shelf
to the wall first. By installing from the top down,
lower shelves don’t interfere with the installation
of higher shelves. Proceed to attach the remaining
shelves to the wall.
If you’re crafty, paint or decoupage your
shelves before you hang them. Stick with
the colors and finishes of your bathroom to
unify your decorating scheme!

Stuff You Need to
Know
Just when you thought you were out of storage space, some innovative
soul dreamt up above-the-toilet storage. You wouldn’t want a few square
feet of perfectly good storage to go to waste, now would you?
Above-the-toilet cabinets, also known as space savers, are available in a 
few different styles. Lightweight shelving supported by four long legs that
straddle the toilet tank is often constructed of metal or wicker and requires
no installation. Cabinetry supported by four long legs that straddle the
toilet tank may require assembly or height adjustment, but otherwise
requires no installation. 
Then there’s wall-mounted cabinetry, which is similar to a wall-mounted
kitchen cabinet and provides the most polished look. For ease of installation,
choose a cabinet that uses a hanging mechanism (one part affixed to the
cabinet slides into another part that you mount on the wall) rather than long
screws that you have to drill through the cabinet and into the walls.

Determine the location of your cabinet. If you’re
hanging a very shallow cabinet with a depth simi-
lar to the toilet tank, hanging it about 6 inches
above the tank allows enough space to open the
tank, as needed. If you’re hanging a deep cabinet,
you need to provide some head room so one can
easily sit on the toilet underneath the cabinet. In
this case, I recommend locating the bottom of your
cabinet at least 26 inches above the toilet tank. 
Measure your chosen space with a measuring
tape to ensure there’s enough room.
Measure the distance from the bottom of the cabi-
net to one of the hanging mechanisms affixed to
the back of it.
104

Space savers are an excellent solution if you have a pedestal-style sink, which provides limited or no storage
space under your bathroom sink.

Measure the distance between the hanging mech-
anisms on the back of the cabinet, and transfer
this measurement to the wall so you know where
to drill your holes.
Use a level to verify that the marks from Step 5
are level.
Locate a wall stud on the wall behind your toilet
with a stud finder, and mark it with pencil. If
you’re unable to locate a wall stud, add drywall
anchors in Step 7 to reinforce the installation.
Determine the height at which to drill your holes
for the hanging mechanisms by adding the meas-
urements from Steps 1 and 2. Mark this height in

Hang your storage cabinet by sliding the hanging
mechanisms onto the screws.
Note that heavy-duty wall cabinets don’t
attach via a hanging mechanism but rather
with long screws drilled through the back of
the cabinet directly into the wall. If you opt
for a cabinet with this type of installation,
you definitely need two people to do the
job. Using the height determined in Step 1,
one person should hold the cabinet up to
the wall while the other person ensures that
it’s level. Drill holes through the back of the
cabinet into the wall stud in at least two
locations. Insert 3-inch screws through the
cabinet into the wall using a screwdriver or
drill equipped with a screwdriver head.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the hanging mecha-
nisms, drill holes in the marked spots, applying
consistent horizontal pressure. If your screw
holes don’t line up with the wall studs marked in
Step 3, add drywall anchors to the screw holes by
inserting them in the holes and then tapping them
almost flush to the wall with a hammer.
Use a screwdriver to twist the screws into the
drilled holes or anchors.

Stuff You Need to
Know
Determine the location of your medicine cabinet. If your
vanity has a wall mirror, locate the cabinet on the nearest
side wall. If your medicine cabinet will function as the pri-
mary mirror in your bathroom, center it over the vanity.
Remember: Medicine cabinets are very heavy and need to be
mounted into wall studs, so the stud location may influence
the location of your medicine cabinet.
1
How do you live in your bathroom? Are you a minimalist with a mirror and
pedestal sink? Do you have an oversized vanity and built-ins? Whether you
exist simply or robustly in your bathroom, a medicine cabinet is a great
organizational addition.
A medicine cabinet has many benefits: It’s an additional mirror; generally is
moisture resistant (unlike regular cabinets); holds supplies and products;
and allows you to conceal countertop toiletries.

Locate the wall stud in your desired location with
a stud finder, and mark it in pencil.
If both you and your significant other use a
wide variety of products, consider installing
two medicine cabinets to corral countertop
clutter like contect lens products and
deodorant.
With a measuring tape, determine how far above
the vanity counter your cabinet will hang. The
height of your cabinet needs to accommodate the
primary user, whether that be a 4-foot child or a 6-
foot adult. Conventional heights are 50 inches
from the floor or 18 inches above the countertop.
Mark the wall at the bottom of the cabinet height.
If you’re having a hard time visualizing the proper
height for your cabinet, cut out a piece of newspa-
per the exact size of the cabinet and tape it to the
wall. This template provides a good visual and is
easy to adjust and play around with!

Use a measuring tape to locate a few additional
horizontally centered spots on the cabinet for
drilling.
Hold the medicine cabinet up to the wall at the
height determined in Step 3, and make sure the
marked center of your cabinet lines up with the
marked wall stud so that the stud can support the
weight of the cabinet. (Note that you may need a
helper.) 
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for this installation, drill
holes in the marked spots on the cabinet, apply-
ing consistent horizontal pressure.
Use a level to verify that the pencil marks you
made in Steps 2 and 3 are aligned.
This installation requires drilling through the
back of the medicine cabinet into the wall stud.
Use a measuring tape to locate the center of the
top of the medicine cabinet. (Note that some med-
icine cabinets have a reinforced/wood portion at
the top, so installing at least one screw through
this area is essential.)

Screw the cabinet to the wall with a screwdriver.
If the holes aren’t drilled into wall studs,
insert heavy-duty drywall anchors (called
Molly bolts or toggle bolts) to strengthen
the installation before you attach the 
cabinet to the wall. Drill a hole that’s big
enough for the bolt to fit through, insert 
the bolt, and trigger it open according 
to the instructions on the package (some-
times you need a second screwdriver to 
do this).

Grab your passport and go! Building a travel toiletry kit
Recent legislative changes sure have thrown
a kink in air travel. If you’re a frequent flier
who opts to carry your luggage onboard, the
following kit is a must! Start with a large, clear
cosmetics organizer with multiple compart-
ments. Label the outside with your mailing
address (in case your kit is misplaced), and
then fill it with the following items:
 Non-liquid: Purchase a back-up set of
common toiletries: comb, brush, tooth-
brush, dental floss, tweezers, disposable
razors, fingernail clippers, makeup,
deodorant, contact lenses, and lens
case. Put these items into a single com-
partment or zippered plastic bag to dis-
tinguish them from liquid items.
 Liquid: Purchase trial-size versions of 
toiletries from your local drugstore. 
Note that the following items must be in 
containers that hold 3 ounces or less:
shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hair spray,
lens cleaner, toothpaste, and mouth-
wash. Leave these liquid items loose in
your travel kit. (Another option is to save
bottles of hotel shampoo, conditioner,
lotion, and body soap. They’re almost
always under 3 ounces and perfect for a
travel kit.)
 Medical: A small collection of medicine
can cure most travel woes; pack pain
reliever, allergy medication, anti-nausea
and anti-diarrhea meds, sunscreen, burn
relief, bug spray, small bandages, and
antibiotic ointment.
 Other: If you have room left in your
travel toiletry kit, include a generic con-
verter, lint brush, sewing kit, safety pins,
ear plugs, and an eye mask.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Bathroom
After you’ve installed one, some, or all the projects that appear earlier in this chap-
ter, it’s time to put your bathroom back together again. The following sections pro-
vide some inspirational ideas for the finishing touches on your new and improved
bathroom.
Medications and cleaning supplies sometimes are stored in bathrooms, but they
should always be kept out of the reach of children and pets. The moisture in bath-
rooms can affect the potency of medications, which are better stored elsewhere. 
I tell you the best ways to store cleaning supplies in your garage in Chapter 11.
Help, my walls are full! Adding 
a corner storage unit
Bathrooms are crowded places. Between a sink, toilet, shower, towel bar, cabinet,
and maybe even a window, you may have run out of wall space! A corner storage
unit is a clever solution for adding even more storage. Who uses the corner anyway?
Corner storage units generally include three to five triangular shelves and range in
height from 3 to 5 feet. They may require light assembly, but no installation is
involved. Decorative bins, baskets, and boxes can neatly hide a multitude of unat-
tractive bathroom items like toilet paper and air freshener. I talk more about these
containers in the next section.
Stash, stow, and store: Using decorative
baskets, bins, and boxes
Decorative baskets, bins, and boxes are a home organizer’s best friend. The right
storage container can transform a pile of unsightly clutter into a clever design state-
ment. Use storage containers to conceal your stuff and accessorize your bathroom;
here are some tips:

Select a basket, bin, or box that complements your bathroom. Some popular
choices are wicker, sea grass, stainless steel, and fabric.

Use an open-top design (meaning no lid) for items that are decorative or need
to be easily accessed. For instance, rolled-up hand towels look great in a natu-
ral woven basket. Candles and lotions are also visually pleasing on display.

Use a box with a lid to conceal loose, unsightly, or mismatched items.
Personal items such as feminine supplies or hair styling tools are well-placed
in a box with a lid. Daily toiletries and paper goods can also be stored in a
box with a lid.

Store items near the areas they’ll be utilized. For example, collections of
hand towels should be located near the sink basin, and bath salts should be
near the edge of the bath tub.

Keeping your jewelry neat and tangle-free
Conventional jewelry boxes have an inherent design flaw: Valuable necklaces always
end up in a big frustrating tangle. I once tried to use a safety pin to untangle the
jumble and actually ended up breaking a delicate gold chain. There are better ways
to store your jewelry!

If you have a recess, alcove, or dressing area in your bathroom, use a petite
wall-mounted peg rack to hold long necklaces. (Belt and tie racks are a bit
larger, but they work great; see Chapter 6 for more on them.) The necklaces
hang vertically, which prevents tangling. Look for a rack with pegs spaced no
more than 1 inch apart to maximize the number of necklaces you can fit on it.

If you store your jewelry in a wall cabinet, create your own necklace rack by
nailing small finishing nails along one interior wall at 1-inch intervals. This
solution doesn’t use up any of your cabinet’s “footprint” because every-
thing’s on the wall.

If you want to display your jewelry on the vanity, consider a jewelry tree
(see Figure 7-1). This item is available at home organization stores and usu-
ally stores up to 12 necklaces — each on its own branch.

Use a conventional jewelry box to organize smaller items by category —
rings in one section, bracelets in another, earrings in a third.

To store all the components of a jewelry set (matching necklace, earrings,
ring, and bracelet) together, consider using an old baby food jar! It’s clear so
that you can easily identify the contents, it’s a convenient size to hold a few
pieces of jewelry, and it’s stackable if you decide to use more than one.
Works for me!

H
ouseholds are busy! Each day brings a new stack of bills, invita-
tions, newspapers, homework, and junk mail. Paperwork piles
begin to form, and before long you’ve lost control of your home
office.
Breathe. Inhale. Exhale. You can maintain control of your home office
by having a well-planned space that acts as one central location for
VIP (Very Important Paper). In an organized office, you add items to
your family’s calendar, you recycle paper, and you maintain your VIP
status. This chapter helps you build an organized office, establish
filing systems, and anticipate the daily inflow of paper. If you stick to
this system, you can maintain your VIP status.
The biggest limitation of a home office is space. You may not be able to devote an
entire room to a home office, but fear not! Your home office can be as small as a
rolling cart tucked away in a hall closet or as extravagant as a dedicated room with 
a built-in desk! Either way, this chapter helps you establish your home office as a
command center from which you run your household.
Before you can put together your home office, you have to take it all apart. Begin by
removing everything from your home office. Pull out all your paperwork, files, elec-
tronics, memorabilia, coffee mugs, and knickknacks. This crucial step allows you to
assess what you have and enables you to quickly eliminate items that don’t support
your goal or aren’t mindful of your office’s limitations.
With the contents of your home office laid out before you, it’s time to sort! I recom-
mend sorting your office paperwork and accessories into four large containers
labeled as follows:

STAY: This item is used regularly, is in good condition, and will stay in the
home office. Examples of “stay” items are office furniture and VIP. For exam-
ple, keep documents that you must retain for tax records, medical records,
insurance documents, wills or trust, receipts, warranties, lists, calendar
items, and gift ideas.

MOVE: This item doesn’t belong in your home office — return it to its real
home! Examples include knickknacks, collectibles, music CDs, DVDs, books,
jewelry, and recipes.

Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the goal. The best thing to do with it is
share it! Examples include unused files, an extra chair, old reference manu-
als, and old office equipment (such as working printers, fax machines, com-
puters, and phones).

GO: Trash or recycle it! A majority of the paperwork stored in a home office
belongs in this category, such as invitations for past events, paperwork
from your child’s school that has already been added to the family calendar,
fliers, and junk mail. Old computer software, cables, and wires fall in this
category, too.
After you determine what’s going to stay in your office, select the projects that help
you maximize the storage in this space. When you’re done, check out the section
“The Finishing Touches: Reassembling Your Home Office” at the end of this chapter
for ideas on maintaining your home office’s organization.
No room for an office? Creating a countertop 
command center
An office, at its core, is simply a place where
VIP (Very Important Paper) is managed. If
you live in tight quarters and can’t dedicate
a whole room to a home office, I recom-
mend transforming a portion of your kitchen
countertop into a small office. To function
properly, it should have a clear countertop,
a quality file, a to-do box, a stationery stash,
a household calendar, and a recycle bin (see
the later section “Curing clutter with six
essential paper stashes”). If you have the
space, you can also keep a small box of
hostess gifts and gift bags in this area. With
proper overhead shelving, these require-
ments are so minimal that they can be con-
tained in about 24 inches of counter length.
Where should you locate your countertop
office? If you live in a spacious, recently built
home you may have a counter space
designed specifically to be a small work sta-
tion. If you live in an older home, you have to
get creative! Select a location that has a coun-
tertop overhang so a chair or stool can be
tucked underneath, is as far away as possible
from the cook top, and has adequate access
to electrical outlets, cable hookups, and
phone jacks. If possible, select a spot with an
overhead cabinet or room for shelving.
Build the base of your office by tucking a
small chair and recycling bin under your
counter. Add your office equipment (com-
puter, printer, phone, and fax), basic office
accessories (sticky notes, note pads, pens,
pencils, tape, scissors, glue, and stapler),
and your file.
As for the rest of your key office compo-
nents, if you have an upper kitchen cabinet
over your countertop desk, fill it up! If you
don’t have any available vertical space, art-
fully arrange your storage containers (your
to-do box, gift box, and stationery stash) by
stacking them, if possible. You can also store
these items in a lower cabinet if your
counter space doesn’t have an overhang
suitable for a chair. Don’t forget to hang
your family calendar nearby!

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Writing letters allows you to convey your thoughts, pass on advice, and
reconnect with loved ones. But by the time you assemble your note cards,
favorite pen, stamps, and return address labels, wouldn’t it have been easier
to send an e-mail? Not anymore! A stationery center is a wall-mounted box in
or adjacent to your home office that contains all your note cards, envelopes,
stamps, return address labels, and pens. Store your address book in your
stationery center, too.
Purchase a box to serve as the foundation piece of your stationery center.
For this project, I’ve zeroed in on a large wall-mounted organizer that has
slots for stationery and shallow areas for pens, stamps, and labels. Adapt
the steps as needed based on your chosen foundation piece.
Determine the location of your stationery center. In
that area, locate wall studs with a stud finder (see
Chapter 2) and mark in pencil. (If you choose to use
a lightweight wire file folder for this project, wall
stud installation isn’t necessary.)
1

If you plan to hang your organizer on a wall adja-
cent to your desk, measure the distance between
the bottom of the unit and the hanging mecha-
nism on the back of the unit. Add 12 inches to this
measurement to determine the height at which
you will hang your stationery center above your
desktop. Measure and mark the wall stud with a
pencil at this height.
If you plan to hang your organizer in a space that
isn’t adjacent to your desk, aim to install the top
of the stationery center at eye level. (Your eye-
level height is about 3 inches less than your
height.) Because the hanging mechanism for this
type of product tends to be located at the top of
the unit, no further measuring is necessary. Mark
the wall stud with a pencil at this height.
If the hanging mechanism detaches from the unit,
remove it and hold it against the wall at the height
determined in Step 2. If you’re not able to detach
it, hold the entire unit up to the wall at the height
determined in Step 2. Push your pencil through
the screw holes on the hanging mechanism to
indicate where you’ll drill your holes.
If you have more than one pencil mark for the
hanging mechanism, use your level to ensure that
they’re level.
A medicine cabinet with adjustable shelves
is a clever solution for a stationery center 
and is available in a wide variety of materials
and colors. Just be sure to pick one that’s
deep enough to hold all your stationery! Turn
to Chapter 7 for instructions on installing 
a medicine cabinet. Other options include
wall-mounted file holders, wall cubbies,
organizational units, and wall pockets.
116

Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the hanging mecha-
nism, drill holes in all marked spots, applying con-
sistent horizontal pressure.
If you’re not drilling into wall studs, reinforce the
installation by using drywall anchors. Simply
position the drywall anchor in the predrilled hole
and tap with a hammer until the anchor is almost
completely in the hole.
Screw the hanging mechanism onto the wall using
a screwdriver.
Hang your stationery center by sliding or angling
the unit on the hanging mechanism bracket.
Load up your stationery center with all the
items required to write a heartfelt note:
thank you notes, blank note cards, mono-
grammed stationery, and envelopes of vari-
ous sizes.Tuck loose items like stamps and
return address labels into blank envelopes
or small boxes. Store pens in a small cup or
container, just like you would store your
toothbrush in your medicine cabinet! To
make stacking easier, keep stationery in the
original boxes if your stationery center is
large enough to accommodate them. Grab a
photo from your nearby photo box and
enclose it with your letter to give it a
personal touch.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
If you’re short on cash or just starting out in an apartment or dorm, this is
the project for you! You take common household items and combine them to
make a functional desk. Quick, cheap, and easy — that’s my kind of project!
Begin by determining the height of your workspace. Sit in your office chair
with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Extend your arms straight out
in front of you. Your desk should be about 2 inches lower than your arm
height and several inches above your knee height. While sitting, use a
measuring tape extended up from the floor to get a precise height.
You can use a variety of items as the base of your desk. Select a pair of
items that have a flat, level surface and are in your comfortable height
range. Two wood or metal filing cabinets of the same height (usually
around 30 inches) work great and provide plenty of file storage as a bonus.
Sturdy stainless-steel trash cans give a contemporary look to a loft or artsy
space. A set of nightstands work if they’re the right height. Stacks of cinder
blocks and plastic crates (weighted down, of course) are other very inex-
pensive options.
Select a flat, rectangular surface to use as the top of your desk. A door is
extremely sturdy and provides ample desk space; just be sure to use one
without recessed panels.
For this project, I’ve zeroed in on a homemade desk made from two metal
filing cabinets and a solid-surface door. Adapt the steps as needed based
on your chosen materials.

Lay the door flat on the floor (protected by a
dropcloth), on sawhorses, or on chairs draped
with dropcloths.
If you’ve purchased a new door for this project,
move on to the next step. If you’re repurposing a
door to serve as the top of your desk, remove all
hardware (hinges, knobs, and stoppers) with a
screwdriver. Wipe down the door with clean rags
and a soap and water solution to remove dirt,
grease, and oils. Let the door dry completely
before moving on.
Sand the door with medium-grit sandpaper to
remove any splinters or rough patches. Then
wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove dust.
Stir your paint or wood stain thoroughly with a
stir stick. If you’re using a roller to apply paint or
stain to the door, pour some from the can into a
paint tray.
Paint or stain both sides of the door, following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Use long, continuous
strokes for the best results.
119
Chapter 8: Organized Home Office, Organized Life

Let the paint or stain dry according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. If you stained
the door, consider repeating Steps 3
through 5 with polyurethane to protect and
seal the finish. (Follow the polyurethane
manufacturer’s instructions for application.)
Use your measuring tape to determine the length
of the door. Transfer this measurement to the
floor of your home office by placing a piece of
masking tape at each end of the length. Position
your two filing cabinets so that the outside edge
of each cabinet lines up with the masking tape.
Remove the masking tape.
Set the door on the filing cabinets. If the door has
a doorknob hole, position that at the back of the
desktop (opposite where you’ll sit) and use it as a
pass-through for computer cords, power cords,
and phone lines. A door is heavy enough not to
shift on the base, so no further installation is
necessary.
To secure a lighter desktop material like ply-
wood to a dissimilar surface such as metal,
you can glue the top to the base. Select glue
that’s appropriate for both the top surface
and the bottom surface. (The salespeople at
your local home improvement store should
be able to steer you in the right direction.) If
you’re connecting a plywood top to wood
filing cabinets, you can nail the two together
with either a hammer or a nail gun — use a
nail at each corner and at 6- to 12-inch inter-
vals wherever the plywood intersects the
cabinet. Remember to always wear safety
goggles when using a nail gun.
If you don’t want a piece of wood as your
desktop, a sheet of glass (regular or tem-
pered) provides a contemporary look. (Note
that glass corners are very sharp and should
be professionally rounded or beveled.) A
sheet of glass is generally heavy enough to
stay in place, but if you’re worried about
shifting, consider adding a bit of putty adhe-
sive at each corner.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
If you don’t have a whole room to devote to a home office, why not make
great use of empty space within a room? It should be at least 36 inches
wide and 20 inches deep, have adequate wall space and ceiling height to
add shelving, and have an accessible electrical outlet and phone jack (if
your components aren’t wireless). Additionally, the office shouldn’t detract
from the function of the room or space around it. 
Measure the height, width, and depth of your space. If you’re using a desk
or desk/hutch combination, select the desk with the largest possible width
that will fit. For instance, if your space measures 481⁄2 inches wide, buy a
desk up to 48 inches wide. If you’re purchasing a piece of plywood to serve
as a top on a homemade desk (see the previous project), have the plywood
cut to 1⁄2 inch less than both the width and depth of the space to account for
walls that aren’t exactly square.
If you’ve purchased or created a flat desk, you need shelving! I recommend
purchasing several floating wooden wall shelves that are slightly smaller
than the width of your space and less than half as deep. For example, if your
space is 481⁄2 inches wide and 281⁄2 inches deep, select shelving that’s about
48 inches wide and less than 14 inches deep. 
The first shelf should be slightly higher than the computer on your desktop.
Plan subsequent shelves at different height levels, keeping in mind the height
of your space and how you plan to use your shelves. No matter how you
plan to use your shelves, make a list of the shelf heights for your project as
measured from the desktop height, not the floor. For example, the shelving in
this project is at heights of 24, 32, and 42 inches above the desktop.

It’s easier to hang shelving above a desk if the
desk is out of the way, so use a pencil to mark the
height of your desk along the wall in your space.
Then temporarily move the desk out of the space.
Locate the wall studs in the back of the space with
a stud finder (see Chapter 2) and mark them with
a pencil.
122

Determine the location of the first, highest shelf
according to your game plan; in this project,
that’s 42 inches above the desktop. Use your
measuring tape to measure this distance along
the wall stud, and mark this height.
Detach the hanging mechanism from your first
wall shelf. Align the hanging mechanism with the
mark from Step 3. Use a pencil to mark through
the screw holes so you know where to drill.

If any of the holes aren’t drilled into wall studs,
add drywall anchors to them to reinforce this
installation. Simply position the drywall anchor
into the hole and tap it with a hammer until the
anchor is almost completely in the hole.
Insert the screws into the hanging mechanism,
and use your screwdriver to screw it in place.
Use a level to ensure that the pencil marks are
level.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the hanging mecha-
nism, drill holes in the marked spots, applying
consistent horizontal pressure.

Hang your floating wall shelf by angling or sliding

Every shelf is different; if necessary connect the
shelf to the hanging mechanism with small screws
provided with the shelf.
Repeat this process for additional shelves
at the heights you determined in your
game plan, working down from the high-
est shelf to the lowest.

computer, printer, office supplies, and
other essentials.

An alternative to a desk: An office on wheels
If you live in very tight quarters, you’ll really
appreciate this idea! If you don’t have the
space to dedicate to a conventional home
office, you can create a mobile home office.
When not in use, you roll your mobile home
office into a hallway closet, spare bedroom,
or underneath a staircase. If you don’t have
an alternative storage space, you can con-
ceal the whole lot with a custom fabric or
leather cover.
Decide what you plan to store in your mobile
home office. Items include office machines
(laptop and printer), supplies, accessories
(sticky notes, note pads, pens, pencils, tape,
scissors, glue, and stapler), files, and boxes.
Estimate the number of levels you’ll need
and the location of each item. I recommend
storing your laptop on the top level, the
printer and its supplies on the second level,
your file and to-do box on the third level,
and any overflow of items on the bottom
level. If you have room, you can also store
your gift box and stationery stash on the
rolling cart. (See the later section “Curing
clutter with six essential paper stashes” for
more about these items.)
Purchase a rolling cart from a large home
store or office supply store that has enough
tiers to accommodate your needs. If you’re
going to store only one piece of office
equipment (your laptop computer, for
example), select a three-tier cart; if you’re
going to store multiple pieces of electronics
(your computer, printer, and fax machine or
scanner), you’ll probably need a four-tier
cart. Whatever the size, select a cart con-
structed from a sturdy material (like stain-
less steel or wire) with a lip on each tray so
items don’t slip off during transport.
A key step of building your mobile home
office is properly harnessing all power cords
and wires into a single surge protector.
Remember that surge protectors are a must
when using computers or other office equip-
ment. Attach a surge protector to the lowest
level of the cart using zip ties or wire or
heavy-duty twist ties (see the later section
“Taking charge of cords” for details on these
items). Thread all electronics cords through
the rear of the shelves to the surge protector,
and plug them in. Gather any excess cord
length and secure it to itself and then to the
cart with zip ties, rubber bands, or twist ties.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling
Your Home Office
After you’ve installed one, some, or all the projects that appear in this chapter, it’s
time to take your home office to the next level. The following sections provides
some inspirational ideas for enhancing your command center.
Lining up electronic equipment
Are you inexplicably drawn to the latest and greatest electronic gizmos? You’re not
alone! Many people are quick to buy electronics — beyond computers — that 
scan, print, fax, laminate, store, and automate all the bits of information in life. 
After you’ve weeded out any unnecessary items (see the beginning of this chapter),
it’s time to find a home for everything that must stay. Here are some tips for doing
just that:

Locate your computer monitor (and desktop PC, if that’s what you have) in
the rear of your desktop, directly in front of your chair. Positioning your
computer as far back as possible gives you extra workspace in the front of
the desk area. (A keyboard and mouse are easy to move out of the way to
clear space to work when you’re not using the computer.) The area behind
your computer is unusable space anyway.

Electronics that require top-loading (some printers, scanners, and faxes)
need to be located on a desktop or a shelf with enough clearance to allow
you to access the top.

Electronics that have a front-loading feature (some printers and faxes) may
be stacked, either on your desktop or on shelves, to clear up valuable desk
space.

Corral small items, like digital camera equipment, cables, and chargers, into
a small decorative box, and store it on a shelf above or near your computer.

Store infrequently used electronics like laminators or label-makers under-
neath your desk or on an upper shelf.
Taking charge of cords
It’s simple to arrange your office equipment: The computer goes here, and the
printer goes there. Arranging the cords, wires, and cables is a whole different story!
One way to avoid a tangle of cords is to purchase wireless office equipment.
Wireless devices communicate by electromagnetic waves in lieu of wires, cords, and
cables. Printers, fax machines, keyboards, mice, and network routers are all avail-
able in wireless formats.
125
Chapter 8: Organized Home Office, Organized Life

If you’re currently committed to office equipment with cords, endless innovations are
available to help you deal with the tangles. After you have your office equipment con-
figured to your liking, plug all cords and chargers into the surge protector. Gather the
excess length of cord into a tight bundle, and bind it with one of the following:

Cable tie or twister: Similar to a garbage bag twister, you wrap the cable
twister around a folded-up bundle of excess cord length to make a tight
grouping. This binder is available in plastic, wire, and even Velcro (see
Figure 8-1).

Cable zipper or snake: String several full-length cords through a rigid cable
zipper, fabric sleeve, or coil to enclose them in a single tube (see Figure 8-1).

Charging station: You plug cellphones, MP3 players, cameras, and other
rechargeable devices into the strip in the charging station. The station
makes for a tasteful, organized display of gadgets (see Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-1: You have several options for organizing electronic equipment wires.

Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 

Figure 8-2: You can charge several electronic gadgets in one spot.
Storing small supplies
Every workspace needs basic office supplies like pens, pencils, staples, tacks, brads,
erasers, tape, and paperclips. And if you do arts and crafts in your office, the list will
include decorative hole punches, colored pens, stickers, and paper cutters. And a
calculator for bill paying. And ink cartridges for your printer. And the list goes on!
Here are a few clever solutions for organizing small items:

Use a junk drawer organizer. These handy devices fit into a desk drawer
and divide the space into small compartments. The compartments in vary-
ing sizes are perfect for storing small items like paperclips, staples, tacks,
rubber bands, and binder clips.

Use magnetic spice canisters. Although they’re designed to hold spices,
these are the perfect size to hold small office supplies. To free up space
both in your drawers and on your desktop, you can adhere the canisters to
the magnetic portion of a message board or to a wall-mounted magnetic
strip, which is usually included with the canisters.

Store your office tools and accessories on a wall-mounted pegboard.
These boards were designed to hold tools like hammers and screwdrivers in
a garage or tool shed, but they’re well suited for office tools like rulers, sta-
plers, glue guns, and craft tools. (See Chapter 11 for steps on mounting a
pegboard.)

Purchase a small desktop organizer or cosmetics organizer if you don’t
have an available drawer or wall space. These organizers hold pens, pen-
cils, rulers, and staplers vertically in compartments. They usually also have
small compartments for erasers, tape, and paperclips, too!

When in doubt, display your pens and pencils in a decorative mug or bud
vase. Remember, less is more!

Chapter 8: Organized Home Office, Organized Life

Curing clutter with six essential paper stashes
In this chapter, one of your goals is to make your home office an organized central
location for all your VIP (Very Important Paper). A vital part of meeting this goal is
to route all incoming paperwork to its respective location! The following six pre-
scriptions should help you cure your cluttered office:

File: If you’ve already taken action on an item, file it! Your file is the most
frequently used component on your desk, so select one with a sturdy con-
struction and an appealing look! I recommend a vertical file box or an accor-
dion file with at least 13 sections — sufficient to accommodate the main
household categories discussed in the next section. Keep your file on a
shelf in your home office that you can access while seated. The easier it is
to access, the more likely you are to maintain a tidy workspace.

To-do box: As you sort through your daily inflow of paperwork, anything
that you need to take action on should be routed to your to-do box.
Examples are bills to pay, invitations to RSVP for, and school permission
slips to sign. Because you’ll use this box daily (I certainly do), I recommend
a sturdy, attractive box with an open top. Stow this box in the most conven-
ient spot possible, at arm’s length. It’s important that you review the con-
tents of this box frequently — at least weekly.

Gift box: A gift box that contains small gifts you plan to give in the future
(such as hostess gifts), inspirations for gifts pulled from magazines, and a
year-round holiday gift list saves so much rushing around time! Your gift
box should be a medium-size container with a lid. Remember: This is not
the place to stash your trove of holiday gifts! If you have the room, store
your gift box on the highest shelf or least accessible area within your home
office. If you don’t have the space, this box can be stored in an alternative
location, like a hall closet or garage.
Be clever! If you find a hostess gift that’s a hit, buy several to keep on hand
for future events. If you see an age-appropriate toy for your children that’s
on sale, buy a few for their friends’ birthdays. If your favorite bottle of wine
goes on sale, buy a few extra bottles to bring to holiday parties. Candles,
potpourri, and cookbooks are also easy yet thoughtful hostess gifts.
If you plan to wrap gifts at your desk, store the following items in the gift
box as well: small, neutral-colored gift bags; colored tissue paper; gift tabs;
ribbons and bows; tape; and scissors.

Stationery stash: Everyone enjoys receiving handwritten notes, but does
everyone love to write them? Having everything you need in one box makes
letter writing less of a burden. If you don’t have a wall-mounted stationery
center (see the project earlier in this chapter), fill a medium box with thank
you notes, blank note cards, plain and decorative stationery, envelopes,
stamps, return address labels, pens, and your address book. You can also
include duplicate or extra photos or pressed flowers with your correspon-
dence (but don’t keep photos in this box indefinitely; they belong in albums
or designated photo boxes).
128
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 


Family calendar: A calendar is essential for every well-run household! I rec-
ommend using the available calendar option on your computer or a calendar
available through your e-mail provider. I like online calendars because events
are easily changed or deleted (rather than crossed out and rewritten), and
you can add items as recurring events, such as birthdays (annual) or exercise
classes (every Wednesday). You can print out electronic calendars weekly or
monthly to suit your needs.

Recycle bin: Home offices are full of paperwork, and most of it should be
directed to your recycle bin. Tackle a paper task, and move on! In order to
protect against identity theft, all personal or financial information (essen-
tially anything with your name, social security number, address, phone
number, medical information, or an account number) should be cross-cut
shredded and then recycled.
What’s missing? Lists! Store your lists — grocery, home improvement, gift, and so
on — adjacent to your family calendar or message center. This location ensures
that each event on the calendar results in a corresponding item added to a list; for
example, the calendar event “Family Secret Santa Exchange” prompts you to add
“$30 gift for Cousin Erik” to the gift list. Chapter 5 tells you how to install a message
center.
Filing your most important papers
First and foremost, a filing system needs to be large enough to accommodate your
VIP (Very Important Paper). Each household will have a different definition of VIP,
but generally it includes information on taxes, bills, medical records, household
items, and insurance documents.
Portable file boxes, filing cabinets, and accordion files are all great options for filing
systems; choose the one that suits your needs and your available office space. You
also have plenty of labeling options: Home office stores sell labels in many styles
(clear, white, and colored) and sizes. You can handwrite your labels or print directly
onto labels using your printer. Keep in mind that your filing system will be a perma-
nent fixture on or near your desk and used frequently, so you should like the way it
looks and feels!
Accordion files generally have 13 sections, and you can expand portable file boxes
and file cabinets to more than 13 sections. Whichever you use, I recommend dividing
your filing system into the following categories:

Medical

Bills

Current warranties

Phone lists

Travel

Gift certificates/coupons
129
Chapter 8: Organized Home Office, Organized Life


Work documents

Insurance documents

Copy of wills/trust

School records

Tax receipts for the current year

Bank statements for the current year

Sentimental items
You can keep past tax receipts and bank statements, up to seven years past, in a
long-term storage area like the garage, attic, or basement.
Staying on top of incoming papers
You’ve probably heard someone say he’s “trying to climb out from underneath
a mountain of paperwork.” If you don’t stay on top of your incoming paperwork —
namely magazines, invitations, and bills — it doesn’t seem like such an exaggera-
tion. Follow these helpful tips to keep your small stack of paper from turning into
a mountain:

Magazines: Beautiful, glossy magazines are very alluring! They’re a great
source of inspiration for exercise, lifestyle, menu planning, and fashion. If
you come across an inspiring item, tear it out of the magazine (really!) and
then put it in your file if you must keep it, your to-do box if you’re going to
take action on it, or your gift box if it’s inspiration for a gift.
If you find that you aren’t able to read your current issue before the next
issue arrives, then cancel your subscription! Eliminating magazine subscrip-
tions is good for both the environment and your pocketbook! You also can
consider transferring your subscription to a local women’s shelter, senior
center, or library.

Invitations: An active social calendar makes it a challenge to keep up with
the constant barrage of invitations. Invitations no longer just come in your
mailbox but also via e-mail, phone call, and Internet! With all the different
avenues of receiving invitations, it’s easy to overlook RSVP’ing to an event
or forgetting an event that you have already RSVP’d for. (Cringe!)
To alleviate this unfortunate situation, stick to the following key steps:
1. RSVP to the event in a timely and appropriate manner. E-mail is 
fastest — but obviously not appropriate for a wedding!
2. Add the event, the address of the event, and any food to bring (for
potluck events) to the household calendar.
3. Add any gifts required to your to-do or shopping list.
4. Add any food to bring (for potluck events) to your grocery list.
5. Program the phone number and address of the location of the event
into your cellphone or add them to your day planner (an item that you
carry with you daily).
6. Toss the invite in the recycle bin if it’s the old-fashioned kind.
130
Part II: Organizing Primary Spaces in Your Home 


Bills: It’s no fun to eat Chinese takeout food in the dark. Well, maybe it’s a
little fun, but it’s not something you want to make a habit of. Bills should be
dealt with in a consistent and methodic manner to ensure that your electric-
ity and other utilities and services never get turned off! Handle incoming
bills in the following manner:
1. Open the bill and shred/recycle the envelope.
2. Highlight the due date of the bill.
3. Add the bill to your to-do box.
4. Designate one day a week as the day to pay all household bills . . .
perhaps “Money Monday”!
5. Add “Money Monday” as a weekly recurring event on your calendar so
that you’re prompted to pay bills each week.
Bills almost always give you at least seven days between when the bill
arrives and when payment is actually due. If you pay all your bills on the
same day every week, they’ll never be late! Additionally, almost every bill
can be paid online, which saves a stamp and mailing time. Many bills are the
same amount every month (like a cable bill or gym membership) and can be
set up under an auto-pay option so that payment is automatically deducted
from your account on a set date each month. Isn’t technology great?
Putting together a totally 
to-date tax record tower
It’s hard to be an adult! Every April 15, you’re expected to submit your federal and
state tax records from the previous year. This means that from January 1 through
December 31, you need to keep all items pertinent to your tax returns, especially

Receipts

Cancelled checks

Proof of payments

Income statements

Investment records

Bank statements

Deductions
And after April 15, you’re expected to keep this entire collection of tax records for
years! And it needs to be labeled and accessible! It may sound like a daunting task,
but there’s a good solution: a tax tower! A tax tower is a vertical storage tower
located within your home office that’s constructed of seven stackable boxes. Select
boxes that are large enough to hold your tax records for an entire year, have rein-
forced edges, and are strong enough to stack seven high. A sturdy hat box is per-
fectly suited for this project.
131
Chapter 8: Organized Home Office, Organized Life

Each box contains an entire year’s worth of tax records. For 364 days of the year this
tower looks like a narrow file cabinet or column in the corner of your home office.
The top level of the tower can be dressed up with a lightweight table lamp, picture
frame, or vase.
On Tax Day, you remove the table lamp and take apart the tower. The bottom level
(tax records from seven years ago) is emptied and refilled with the current year’s tax
records. This box is relabeled with the current year and placed on top! Replace your
table lamp or decoration, and you’re prepared should the IRS come calling. (Cross
your fingers that they don’t.)
Tax records — which include receipts, W-2s, bank statements, and other financial
documentation — need to be kept for at least seven years. Many experts recom-
mend keeping your tax returns (the actual filed documents) indefinitely. When it’s
time to get rid of the old box of tax records, transfer your returns to long-term stor-
age, and use a cross-cut paper shredder to ensure that all financial information is
sufficiently destroyed. Shredded paper bits can be recycled or used for packing
material or children’s art projects!

Part III
Organizing Secondary
Spaces in Your Home

In this part . . .
T
his part addresses the smaller — yet critical — areas
of your life at home. These aren’t the rooms your
family spends much time in, per se, but they are used 
on a daily basis. Like Part II, this part guides you through
the five-step process of home organization, and I provide
numerous project suggestions. These chapters are heavy
on finishing touches so you can enhance the quality of the
time you do spend in your kids’ spaces, laundry room, or
garage.

C
hildhood is a magical time for learning, development, and fun.
The goal of a kids’ space (either a bedroom or a playroom) 
is an organized room to help your kids do things themselves — 
and have fun doing it! Features are plenty of space to play and 
create and accessible storage for stuffed animals, toys, clothing, 
and linens. Often it’s just quicker to do it yourself, but in the long 
run, it pays off to equip children with the skills to do it themselves
at an early age.
What’s the best way to achieve your goal of an organized kids’ space?
Begin by evaluating your child’s bedroom or playroom to determine
the limitations of the space. A simple way to accomplish this is to ask
yourself the following questions:

Does the closet provide adequate storage?

Is there enough play space in the room?

Does your child have somewhere to work on homework, puzzles, art, 
and more?

Are piles of toys becoming a problem?

Are you utilizing your wall space for storage solutions?

Have your child’s belongings crept into other areas of your home?
The answers to these questions will help you understand the current limitations of
your kids’ space and decide which projects and finishing touches in this chapter will
help you reach your goal.

Part III: Organizing Secondary Spaces in Your Home 
After you’ve established a goal and limitations for your kids’ space, it’s time to sort.
Review your children’s belongings (clothing, toys, and books) and sort the items
into four categories: STAY, MOVE, SHARE, and GO. This crucial step will help you
determine what volume of stuff needs to be stored and establish specific require-
ments for your projects — you can’t hang a stuffed animal net until you know how
many stuffed animals it needs to hold!

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the room. Examples include clothing that’s in good shape
and regularly worn and toys and books that are in good shape, age appro-
priate, and used often.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and used often, but it doesn’t belong
in the kids’ space. Who knows what items kids will drag into their room
next! When you’re sorting through your children’s space, you’re likely to
find random items like scuba equipment, dusters, or Mommy’s high heels
that have been missing for months!

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the goal of the room. Examples include
excess stuffed animals and furniture, books, clothing, and toys your chil-
dren have outgrown. If you have younger children (or plan to), move these
items to a labeled box in your garage or spare closet until the next one is
ready for them.

GO: This item is trash! Examples include broken toys, worn-out clothing,
and torn books.
Encourage your kids to help you sort! Talk to them about the value of donating
gently used clothing and toys to families who can’t afford to buy their own. Give
them an age-appropriate task like sorting through clothing or books, but be careful
about asking them to sort through toys or stuffed animals — they’ll want to keep all
of them!
After you sort the contents of your kids’ space, choose the projects that will help
you store what’s in the “STAY” pile, and get to work! When you’re done, check out
the section “The Finishing Touches: Reassembling Your Kids’ Space” at the end of
this chapter for ideas and clever purchases to enhance your children’s rooms.

Chapter 9: Playing Up Kids’ Spaces
Memory maker: Creating a keepsake box
Phew. Raising kids is definitely a full-time
job, and managing the inflow of stuff is cer-
tainly a large chunk of it. Every day brings a
new delivery of homework, report cards,
awards, crafts, photos, goody bags, and
gifts. Luckily, most of this stuff is temporary
and can be tossed or donated when your
child is looking the other way.
Breathe easy knowing that the few items
that make the cut can be preserved in a
keepsake box. It doesn’t have to be pretty; it
just has to be large, have a lid, and be water-
proof. I recommend using a solid-colored
sturdy plastic box because if the box is clear,
little eyes may catch sight of a special some-
thing and prompt some digging through the
contents. Trust me on this one!
Create one keepsake box per child and store
it away from little eyes, either in the garage
or on an upper shelf in the child’s closet.
Label the lid with the child’s name, and use
this box to preserve special items such as
 Precious baby clothes: Select two to three
of your favorite baby outfits or shoes.
Make sure each item is properly cleaned
before storing it in your keepsake box.
You can further preserve the items by
storing them in plastic zippered bags.
Throw in a fresh baby diaper, too — as
the years pass, you’ll forget how little
those things are!
 Awards: A title like “Kindergartener of
the Month” is quite the honor, and the
accompanying certificate should defi-
nitely be stored in your child’s keepsake
box. But you don’t need to keep every
participation certificate from soccer,
gymnastics, or art class. Remember that
less is more.
 Professional photographs: Class photos,
school photos, and team photos are
great fun to look at years down the road.
Remember your own third grade photo
with no front teeth? Photographs don’t
take up much space, so store away! Just
be sure to put them into acid-free
sleeves and folders to protect them over
the years.
 Special creations: Every now and then, a
piece of your child’s artwork just melts
your heart. Maybe it was your kinder-
gartener trying to paint a family portrait,
a really special class project, or the first
time your youngster wrote his own
name. As artwork and projects pass
through your fingertips daily, weed out
the really special ones and add them to
the keepsake box. Remember, your kids
bring home special memories year after
year, so limit yourself to no more than 12
pieces a year. You can do it!
 Medals and trophies: Kids love the vali-
dation of receiving trophies or medals
for their accomplishments! Embrace this
enthusiasm by displaying their accom-
plishments in their bedrooms. When
they tire of having them on display, pho-
tograph your child holding each medal
or trophy and donate the bulky items to
your local Special Olympics or youth
sports 
organization. 
Many 
sports
leagues recycle old trophies. Keep the
photos of the medals or trophies, along
with one or two special awards, in your
child’s keepsake box.
 Written memories: Childhood passes by
in a flurry of activity. If you can, take the
time to jot down funny anecdotes, firsts,
and reflections in a journal or on note
cards. These don’t need to be fancy, just
heartfelt. Don’t forget to add the date of
each entry! Store your memory journal
in the keepsake box and smile when you
stumble upon it ten years later.
You may want to present this keepsake box
to your child as a wedding present or house-
warming gift. I can think of no better pres-
ent from a parent to a child.

Hanging a Wall-Mounted Storage Net
Toolbox:
 Measuring tape
 Pencil
 Level
 Drill
 Drill bits
Materials:
 Catchall net (with mount-
ing hardware)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Children are drawn to little stuffed animals, medium-sized stuffed animals,
and ENORMOUS stuffed animals. A catchall net is the perfect corner-mounted
solution that gets stuffed animals off the floor. Assess your child’s collection
to determine if you need one net or two . . . or six. Storage nets are hung from
three hooks in the corner of a room. I recommend hanging your net at a kid-
friendly height of 40 to 50 inches off the floor so they can put items away
themselves. If you need more than one net, place the lowest net at 36 inches
and then hang each additional net above in 24- to 36-inch increments.
Use a measuring tape and pencil to mark the height at
which you want to hang your net. Mark the corner as
well as the two adjacent walls.
1

Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
hook required for the net, drill a hole in the
corner at the height marked in Step 1, applying
consistent horizontal pressure.
Twist a sturdy hook into the corner (as close as
possible to the corner) at your chosen height.
139
Chapter 9: Playing Up Kids’ Spaces

3
Hang your net from the corner hook, and stretch
it out toward the side walls. Mark the exact loca-
tions of your other two hooks with a pencil,
noting that the net should be loose enough to
cradle a large stuffed animal.
Note: You may want to get some help with this
step. It’s much easier to measure the proper
height and adjust the hooks with two people
involved.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than
the hooks required for the net, drill holes
at the spots marked in Step 4, applying
consistent horizontal pressure. Screw 
in the two remaining hooks, and hang
your net. Hang additional nets above 
the first net as desired.
Hold your level up against the wall to ensure that
each side hook mark is at the same height as the
installed corner hook.
A net works especially well if you have a 
pet that has mistaken a cherished stuffed
animal for a chew toy.Wall-mounted
catchall nets also work great for decorative
throw pillows!

Customizing a Toy Chest
I’m a sucker for theme rooms. In the last few years, I’ve transformed my
daughter’s room from garden to rock star to hippie-chick and my son’s
room from transportation to surfer to jungle. And I think they’re both ready
for a new transformation! At least I am. . . .
You may not change your room themes quite as often as I do, but I’m cer-
tain you can identify the decorating style, theme, or color scheme of your
child’s room. This project tells you how to transform an unfinished wood
box into a designer storage accessory, complete with stenciled images and
your child’s name (or a special message), that coordinates with your
child’s room.
I recommend selecting an unfinished toy chest with safety hinges that 
prevent the lid from slamming closed on little fingers. Toy chests are great
storage solutions for bulky stuffed animals or dress-up clothes, so buy a
roomy one (at least 32 inches wide).
Adorn your child’s toy chest with unexpected theme elements to add even
more punch. For example, for a pirate theme, hot glue a few gold coins on
the chest. For a princess theme, attach a princess tiara, earrings, and a
feather boa border to the chest. Let your imagination run wild!

 Medium-grit sandpaper
 Clean rags
 Stir sticks for paint
 Paint tray
 Paintbrush or small roller
 Measuring tape
 Disposable plastic plates
 Stencil brushes (one for
each accent color)
 Paper towels
 Small paintbrush for

 Latex paint in base color
 Stencils (as many as

Time Needed:
About a day
Stuff You 
Need to Know

Prepare a well-ventilated painting area by laying
down dropcloths or newspaper to protect the
floor. Cover the hinges and any other hardware on
the toy chest with blue painter’s tape to protect it
from paint.
Sand the chest with medium-grit sandpaper to
eliminate splinters and smooth the surface. Wipe
it down with a clean, damp rag to remove dust for
a paint-ready surface.
Stir your base color paint with a stir stick, and
then pour some into a paint tray (it’s more man-
ageable than painting directly from the can). Using
a paintbrush or small roller, paint your toy chest a
light base color, such as white, cream, light blue,
or light pink so that darker-colored stencils will
pop. If you plan to use very dark accent stencils,
you may opt for a deeper base color, like gray.
Note: Let the base coat of paint dry completely
before you move on to stenciling.
Place the first stencil where you want it on the
toy chest, and use a measuring tape to ensure 
that it’s centered. Use painter’s tape to secure 
the stencil.

Shake up the stencil paints, and squirt a small
amount of each onto the plastic plates.
Load a stencil brush with paint by gently dipping
the tips of the brush in the paint. Blot off excess
paint by tapping the bristle tips on a paper towel.
The brush should look almost dry before you
apply it to the stencil.
Lightly pounce color onto select areas of the sten-
cil and toy chest by quickly touching the brush
bristles to the stencil and pulling the brush
straight up and away.
Repeat Steps 4 through 7 for additional stencils
until you’ve achieved your desired look. If you
plan to use a stencil with multiple colors, let the
first color of paint fully dry before overlapping a
new color.
After all paint has completely dried, use a small
brush to outline your figures or add extra decora-
tive touches.

Installing Extra Closet Shelving
Toolbox:
 Stud finder
 Pencil
 Measuring tape
 Level
 Drill
 Drill bits
 Screwdriver
Materials:
 Wall shelf (with mounting
hardware)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Kids’ rooms contain stuff they no longer use (although hopefully you’ve
gotten rid of these items in your preliminary sorting), stuff they use right
now, and stuff they will use . . . someday. The “someday” items are my
focus with this project; they may include hand-me-downs that the kids
haven’t grown into and toys you’re saving for later.
I recommend storing “someday” items in the least-accessible portion of the
bedroom because they’re off-limits or not used on a regular basis. The top
portion of a child’s closet, above the clothing rod, is ideal. 
Measure the dimensions of the available space above the clothing rod 
so you can buy the correct number of shelves in the right size. Measure 
the available height from the top of the rod to the top of the ceiling; the
available depth from the front closet wall to the back closet wall; and 
the available length from the inside left wall to the inside right wall. Note
any closet features that would hinder installation such as light fixtures,
clothing rod brackets, or recessed areas.
Purchase shelves with the maximum possible dimensions for your space.
You can buy shelves up to 1⁄2 inch less than the available depth of your space,
and I recommend purchasing shelves with a width about 6 inches less than
the available width of your space to allow some wiggle room when locating
wall studs. If you’re working with 12 to 36 inches of vertical height, I recom-
mend adding a single shelf. If you have more than 36 inches of vertical 
height at the top of the closet, you can easily add two shelves; allow at 
least 18 inches of vertical distance between shelves. 

144
Part III: Organizing Secondary Spaces in Your Home 
Use a stud finder to locate a wall stud in the back
of the closet above the closet rod, and mark in
pencil. Measure 16 inches to either side to locate
and mark an additional wall stud. Repeat along
the span of the closet wall where the shelf will 
be hung.
Your child’s closet may have a shelf with
hanging space instead of a rod.You can
easily adapt the instructions in this project
to work for the space above the existing
shelf.
Determine the location of the first shelf. I recom-
mend hanging it as low as possible, ideally a few
inches above the clothing rod. Use a pencil to
mark this height along the studs.
Hold the shelf up to the wall so that the hanging
mechanisms align with your stud marks from 
Step 1, and use a pencil to mark through the
screw holes to indicate where you’ll drill holes.

Chapter 9: Playing Up Kids’ Spaces
Use a level to ensure that the spots you marked in
Step 3 are level.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the hanging mechanism, drill
holes in all the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
Want a clever use for extra closet shelving
in your child’s room? Divide your child’s toys
into three or four groups, and store each
collection in a large plastic box on the
shelving. Once a week, substitute a new box
of toys for an old box.Your child will delight
in a new box full of surprises, and you’ll
watch in amazement as old toys become
new again.
If you’re unable to drill into a wall stud, reinforce
the installation by using drywall anchors. Simply
position the drywall anchor into the predrilled
hole and tap with a hammer until the anchor is
almost completely in the hole.
Use a screwdriver to insert the screws and hang
your shelf. Repeat this process for additional
shelves.

Creating Under-the-Bed Rolling Storage
A twin-size bed in a child’s room provides more than 15 square feet of stor-
age underneath the bed! By adding stackable, readymade bed risers (avail-
able in home stores) to the feet of your child’s bed, you can add anywhere
from 1 to 7 inches of height. With a custom storage unit, you can maximize
this area to store books, bedding, toys, dress-up clothing, shoes and socks,
or bulky items like sleeping bags or luggage. The storage unit box that you
create in this project will free up tons of closet space and floor space!
Before you run out and buy any supplies, measure the width, length, and
height of the space underneath the bed to determine how much space you
have. Note that the box will need to slide in and out between the risers. For
the width, measure the available space between the risers or bed legs on the
left and right side of the bed; for the length, measure the available space
between the risers or bed legs at the head and foot of the bed; for the height,
measure the usable space between the floor and the bottommost portion of
the bed frame. Keep an eye out for any features of your bed that would pro-
hibit under-the-bed storage or at least prompt adjustments in the size of
your storage box, such as a support leg in the center of the bed frame.
After you’ve determined the under-the-bed dimensions, plan the dimensions
of your box so you can buy the right amount of wood. You may want to sub-
tract 2 inches from the width measurement so that your child doesn’t bump
his or her toes on the box when making the bed, and you should subtract 
1 inch from the length for “wiggle room” and 3 inches from the height 
measurement to account for rolling casters. Then, pick the closest size of
standard wood board without going over. Everybody has heard the term
one by four, or 1x4, which refers to a piece of hardwood (like oak) or soft-
wood (like pine) lumber (not plywood) with specific measurements: As
detailed in Chapter 3, the “four” refers to the width of the piece, and it’s
actually 31⁄2 inches wide instead of 4 inches. The same goes for one by six,
one by eight, and so on — they’re all 1⁄2 inch less than the listed width. The
standard wood board width choices for this project are 4, 6, 8, or 10 inches.
For example, a 10-inch high space under the bed minus 3 inches for casters

is 7 inches, so you’d use the next lowest standard
board size, a 1x6, which is 51⁄2 inches wide. Here’s
an example of dimensions for the space under the
bed and for the box to help you get your numbers
straight:
Dimensions of available space under the
bed: Width 38 inches, length 73 inches,
height 10 inches
Dimensions for the under-the-bed box: Width
36 inches (reduced by 2 inches), length 72
inches (reduced by 1 inch), height 7 inches
(reduced by 3 inches), wood board 1x6
When you have the dimensions of your box
planned, it’s time to shop for your wood. You
need a base piece of 1⁄2-inch plywood to match
your width and length dimensions; two 1x6 pieces
of wood board to match your length dimension;
and two 1x6 pieces of wood board to match your
width dimension minus 11⁄2 inches (to accommo-
date the corners of the box). Here’s a wood
supply list for the example dimensions:
1⁄2-inch plywood, dimensions 36 x 72 inches
1x6 wood board, two pieces each cut to 
72 inches long
1x6 wood board, two pieces each cut to 
341⁄2 inches long (allows for the thickness of
the corners)
Lay out the length pieces and width pieces in a
rectangular formation. Add wood glue to connect
the width piece and the length piece, and quickly
position them together. (You can apply glue either
to the end of the width piece or the side of the
length piece.) Repeat with the other end of the
width pieces and the other length piece.
Connect all corners with clamps, and allow
approximately two to three hours for the glue to
dry. Leave clamps on for Step 3.
Reinforce the corners with nails. Turn the rectan-
gular frame on its side, and if the clamps don’t
interfere, use your nail gun or hammer to nail two
to three nails through one end of a length piece
into the width piece at the corner. Repeat on the
remaining corners, and then remove the clamps.
If you’re unable to nail because of the type of
clamp you’re using, remove one clamp and nail
through one end of a length piece into the width
piece at the corner. Repeat on the remaining cor-
ners, removing one clamp at a time.

Lay the frame on the ground so that the sides are
vertical and the bottom edge is facing up. Position
the base sheet of plywood on top of the frame.
Use a nail gun or hammer to drive nails through
the base into the frame pieces. Hammer in two to
three nails at every corner and at 6- to 12-inch
increments along the width and length pieces to
securely connect the base to the frame.
While the unit is upside-down, position four cast-
ers on the bottom corners of the base. Each
caster should have four screw holes, so locate
your casters so that three of the four holes align
with length or width frame pieces. Use a pencil to
mark where you’ll drill your screw holes.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the casters, drill holes in 
the 16 marked spots, using consistent vertical
pressure.
Screw the casters onto your base. For each caster,
use 1-inch screws for the three screws installed
into the wood board frame pieces, and use 1⁄2-inch
screws for the single screw installed into the ply-
wood. You use shorter screws for the plywood so
that you don’t get a sharp screw poking up
through the bottom of the storage box.
Flip your box over, fill it up, and roll it 
under the bed.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Kids’ Space
After you’ve installed one, some, or all the projects that appear earlier in this chap-
ter, it’s time to put your kids’ space back together again! The following sections pro-
vide some inspirational ideas for pint-sized storage pieces and furniture
arrangements.
Using 4-x-4 storage units
The best organizational item I own is a 4-x-4 storage unit. As the name implies, this
unit has a frame with 16 individual storage cubbies, and each cubby has about 1
cubic foot of storage (see Figure 9-1). You can customize each cubby with bins,
drawers, or doors, or you simply can leave it as open storage. Available at many
home stores, this unit is a workhorse, and if you’re willing to scale back your chil-
dren’s toy collections, it can store all their toys, books, and more.
Figure 9-1: A 4-x-4 storage unit has room for toys, books, crafts, and more.

150
Part III: Organizing Secondary Spaces in Your Home 
A few of my favorite uses for this unit are

A bedroom divider: Use your 4-x-4 unit to separate the sleeping part of a
child’s bedroom from the play area.

An organizer in a playroom: Your 4-x-4 unit can hold toys, books, craft sup-
plies, diapering supplies, and games. Small children can’t reach the upper
cubbies, making them a great place to stash items that aren’t childproof.

A toy cubby underneath a loft bed: You can store all your child’s toys and
books in the 16 cubbies, and placing it under a loft bed is a great use of
space. As your child grows and you add a desk under the loft, use the 4-x-4
unit to store books and desk supplies. 
Bolt the unit to a wall to prevent tipping.
Go, Van Gogh, go! Stocking an art cart
Kids (and those of us who are kids at heart) love arts and crafts. Experimenting with
different textures like fabric, feathers, and foam enhances fine motor skills and is
just plain fun. Let your children’s imaginations run wild by providing them with a
child-size craft station in a four-tier rolling cart with drawers. You won’t believe the
results!
I recommend providing a wide variety of craft supplies, but don’t overdo it. Stick to
items that are easy to sweep up or vacuum. Years of being a “Craft Mom” have
taught me to just say no to glitter glue, stamp pads, Play-Doh, and very small beads.
Nobody likes to pick Play-Doh out of the carpet!
Group items into logical categories, one per drawer:

Base: The foundation of a craft project includes construction paper, white
paper, coloring pages, foam frames, wood frames, and wood hearts or other
shapes.

Accessories: The things kids can adhere to the base include feathers, pipe
cleaners, pompoms, beads, and stickers.

Tools: The things kids use to manipulate materials include safety scissors,
hole punchers, stencils, rulers, and glue sticks.

Coloring: You guessed it! The items in this category include washable mark-
ers, colored pencils, and crayons.
Fill up your craft cart and label each drawer. If your child can read, use word labels.
If your child is learning to read, use a visual cue (such as a picture of scissors) and a
word label (“Scissors”) for each drawer. Talk to your children about how this is their
craft cart and they’re in charge of putting items back in the proper drawers. Kids
love the responsibility and structure of ownership!
Locate your craft cart next to a small work table in your children’s bedroom or play-
room. Provide age-appropriate sample projects from magazines to inspire your chil-
dren, and let their imaginations soar. Enhance this space with a bulletin board to
display their masterpieces!

Outfitting a “coffee corner” for reading
A funny thing happens when I’m in a preschool, church nursery, or playcare environ-
ment — I end up sitting on little chairs at a little table with little people. I don’t know
how the teachers manage to work all day in this miniature environment, but it sure
does suit the needs of children.
My church nursery has what’s referred to as a “coffee corner.” I laughed at this
description, but it’s true! Coffee houses have perfected the technique of creating a
cozy grouping of armchairs, small tables, and magazine/newspaper racks. The nurs-
ery has a kid-sized version of the “coffee corner,” and the kids love it!
Create a “coffee corner” in your child’s playroom or bedroom by following these
simple steps:
1. Start with an area rug, and position it a few inches from the corner of the
room.
2. Add two kid-sized armchairs; opt for the medium version rather than 
the tiny version so that adults can be reasonably comfortable on these
chairs, too.
3. Add a small square coffee table-like workspace that can be used for
games, art, puzzles, or free play.
4. Mount a magazine rack on the adjacent wall to hold a collection of books.
5. Mount wall cubbies or shelves to hold games, toys, and supplies.
Hang tight! Expanding closet rods
I love to see the determination on a toddler’s face as he climbs up a step stool and
grabs a cup from a cabinet that’s beyond his reach. It would have been easier for
him to ask for help, but children have an innate need to be productive people and do
it themselves.
This same principle applies to getting dressed each day. Young children, particularly
girls, love to pick out their clothes each day and dazzle you with their combinations
of cowgirl hat, princess dress, and rain boots. Even though their outfits may not
match, children will appreciate your words of affirmation as they show off their
ensembles. Support your youngster by adding a lower clothing bar to the closet.
Children’s clothing is very short, so you can easily double hanging space in the
closet. A lower bar allows your child to easily access her own clothing and help put
away her laundry. The following solutions are both easy and temporary so that you
can readjust the closet as your child grows:

Purchase closet rod expanders or doublers at home organization stores or
large home stores. The standard models can expand from about 20 inches
to 35 inches wide and hang below the higher closet rod at a height of 28 to
50 inches. You simply customize the width and height of the expander, like
you would a tension rod, and connect the unit to your existing rod with the
hooks provided (check out Figure 9-2).
151
Chapter 9: Playing Up Kids’ Spaces


Create your own lower rod by hanging a shower rod or dowel from your
upper rod. I recommend connecting the two with a rigid material like heavy-
gauge wire so the lower rod doesn’t swing.

Learning to Love Your Laundry Room
S
ort, empty pockets, spot treat, wash, dry, hang, fold, press, repeat.
The process of doing laundry is a rhythmic cycle of incoming
dirty items and outgoing clean items. Like ever-forming laundry piles,
laundry rooms are very predictable — you’re not going to find a small
home office or a reading nook tucked in this space! Laundry rooms
are for doing laundry, plain and simple. They’re generally small
spaces, but with a few simple enhancements they can do big things!
This chapter helps you free up your crowded laundry room by wall-
mounting ironing boards and drying racks and adding a clothing line.
I also address storage and organization of cleaning supplies in wall
cabinets. Trust me, no sock is left unturned!
The goal of your laundry room is a serene space where you accomplish
all tasks involved in cleaning clothes. Your laundry room may have lim-
itations standing in the way of this goal, such as a small size, limited air
flow, or lack of storage. Furthermore, most households are guilty of laundry-related
items winding up in other parts of the house. It’s not uncommon to see piles of folded
clothes on a sofa, an ironing board propped up against a bedroom wall, or clothing
draped on a treadmill. Although you may enjoy performing mundane laundry-related
tasks in the living space of your home, these items are an eyesore and a constant
reminder of laundry. And it’s unfair to blame your missed treadmill workouts on your
unorganized laundry room! If you can accomplish your sorting, cleaning, folding, and
ironing in the confines of your laundry room, you save a lot of scurrying-around time
and preserve the serenity of your living spaces.
Because the laundry room is generally isolated from the living spaces of your home,
it usually isn’t a catchall for stuff like most rooms in the home. In fact, laundry
rooms are generally missing key components like irons, ironing boards, and laundry
baskets! After you know your laundry room’s goal and limitations, it’s time to empty,
sort, and retrieve missing things. Transfer the entire contents of your laundry room
to an adjacent room — this can be accomplished in minutes — and sort it into the
following four categories:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the laundry room. Most items fall under this category, such
as detergent, spot treatment, bleach, and laundry baskets.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and is used often, but it should be
moved to the linen closet or bedroom. Examples include towels, sheets, 
and pillowcases as well as items that have crept into the room like children’s
toys, work projects, and your secret stash of holiday gifts!

If you own a cat (or two or three), remove the litter box from the laundry
room! Animal scents don’t enhance the path to clean clothing. Litter boxes
are ideally located in a garage, separate mudroom, covered porch, or other
space not associated with cleaning or food preparation.

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the laundry room’s goal. Examples are
extra linens or duplicate laundry accessories like hampers or ironing
boards. Donate these items to charity, or put them in your next garage sale.

GO: This item is trash! Examples include used dryer sheets or cleaning
products that are expired or empty.
After you sort the contents of your laundry room, go on a scavenger hunt to collect
missing items that actually belong in the laundry room! Gather up your iron, ironing
board, starching products, and that pile of clothing you were getting around to
pressing.
Select the projects from this chapter that will help you maximize the storage in 
your small laundry space. When you’re done, check out the section “The Finishing
Touches: Reassembling Your Laundry Room” at the end of this chapter for ideas on
maintaining your laundry room’s newfound organization.
A family affair: Having your kids help with laundry
Whether you’re carting around your chubby
cherub in a basket of clean towels or nag-
ging your tween to put away her clean
clothes, getting the kids involved in the
laundry process is important and will cut
down on your workload in the long run. You
can even make it fun by following these tips:
 A basket of clean laundry is a tactile expe-
rience for infants who can sit up unas-
sisted. Plop your little one in the laundry
room next to you and watch him dig
through the basket of clean clothes. You
can probably fold an entire load of laun-
dry while he’s occupied with new textures.
 Toddlers love to dump and sort. After
clothes have completed the spin cycle in
the washing machine, dump damp
clothes into a laundry basket on the floor
and have your toddler fill up your dryer.
Add encouragement and clapping and
your dryer should be filled up in . . . about
ten minutes. It may not be faster than
doing it yourself, but it will save your
back in the long run! (Note: Remove
crackers and action heroes before run-
ning the dryer.)
 Preschoolers are learning to be inde-
pendent, and you can help by giving
yours the task of putting away her
socks, underwear, pajamas, and any-
thing else that doesn’t require hangers.
If she’s determined, she’ll do a pretty
good job of folding too!
 Children in grade school can read and
multiply, and in my book that means
they should be able to put away their
own laundry. Ensure that dresser draw-
ers are easily accessible and clothing
rods are at a child’s height to assist your
child in this task. (See Chapter 9 for ideas
on organizing kids’ closets.) Reinforce
the message by teaching your child that
if he wants to look nice for school, it’s his
job to bring dirty clothes to the laundry
room and put his clean clothes away.
 Around the time the hormones kick in,
adolescents should be fully in charge of
their laundry. Start early and stick to
your guns so you don’t end up being
the parent of the college kid with pink
socks and underwear!

Chapter 10: Learning to Love Your Laundry Room
Installing a Retractable Clothesline
According to my home’s resident laundry expert — my husband — the
most frustrating part of doing laundry is trying to find a spot to hang gar-
ments that are drying. Items hanging from doorways or in hallways drip
onto the floor and often fall off the hanger. Fortunately, my home’s resident
organizer — me — has a quick fix: a retractable clothesline! This handy
device spans the length of one wall of your laundry room and can hold a
basket’s worth of laundry. You simply pull the clothing line from the main
wall bracket and connect it to the receiver wall bracket. When not in use,
the line retracts and is concealed inside the main bracket. No more trail of
drying garments littering your doorways, hallways, and bathrooms!
Purchase a clothesline that’s at least as long as the wall parallel to where
you’ll hang the line. I recommend hanging your line parallel to the longest
wall available; you’ll mount the brackets on the two walls adjacent to the
long wall.
Toolbox:
 Measuring tape
 Pencil
 Drill
 Drill bits
 Screwdriver
Materials:
 Retractable clothesline
(with mounting hardware)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know

Grab your measuring tape and determine the
exact location of the brackets on your walls. I rec-
ommend locating them high enough to accommo-
date hanging garments — 65 to 75 inches from the
floor should do the trick.
Also, determine how far away from the longest
wall you want to install the brackets. If you intend
to dry your clothes on hangers, make sure the
line, when extended, is at least 12 inches away
from the long wall to accommodate standard
hangers. If you intend to use clothespins, you can
locate your brackets closer to the long wall.
Measure the distance between the screw holes on
the main bracket and transfer this measurement
to the wall at the height determined in Step 1.
Note that some models allow you to stick a pencil
through the bracket to mark where you’ll drill
holes.
Hold the receiver bracket up to the opposite wall
directly across from the main bracket. Use a meas-
uring tape to measure down from the ceiling and
in from the corner to make sure that your brackets
are in the same place on opposite walls. Use a
pencil to mark through the screw holes to indicate
where you’ll drill holes to mount the bracket.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for installing the brackets, drill
holes in all the premarked spots, applying consis-
tent horizontal pressure.
Use a screwdriver to screw both the main and
receiver brackets to the wall.

Installing an Accordion Drying Rack
Toolbox:
 Measuring tape
 Pencil
 Stud finder
 Level
 Drill
 Drill bits
 Screwdriver
Materials:
 Accordion drying rack
(with mounting hardware)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Because your rack will hold up to 20 pounds of laundry, you need to install
it into at least one wall stud.
If you don’t have an entire wall to dedicate to drying laundry, consider a
wall-mounted accordion rack. This gadget looks like a towel bar when
retracted and expands outwards in an accordion fashion to hold items
while drying. An accordion rack is also handy to have over a laundry room
sink so drips can go directly into the basin.

Determine the location and height of your drying
rack. I recommend locating it on a side wall or
over a sink at about arm-level height (around 55
to 60 inches from the floor) to lessen any strain
on your back, but the height is purely personal
preference. If you have curious little children, you
may want to install it at your eye level (60 inches
or more from the floor) so that the kids won’t mis-
take it for a set of monkey bars.
Use your measuring tape and a pencil to mark the
wall at your desired height.
At your marked height, locate a wall stud with a
stud finder (as I describe in Chapter 3) and mark
the spot in pencil.
Drying racks are typically wall-mounted using two
detachable brackets. Hold one bracket up to the
wall along the wall stud at the spot determined 
in Step 2. Stick a pencil through the screw holes
on the bracket to mark the wall. These marks 
indicate where you’ll drill your holes. Repeat 
for the second bracket.

Use a level to ensure that the screw marks for
both brackets are level.
Using a drill bit with a slightly smaller diameter
than the screws required for the brackets, drill
holes in all the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
If the placement of your rack means that you’re
only able to mount one bracket into a wall stud,
strengthen the installation of the other bracket by
adding drywall anchors. Simply position the dry-
wall anchor into the predrilled hole and tap with a
hammer until the anchor is almost completely in
the hole.

Adding a drying rack over the sink cuts your cleanup in half after a day at the beach, pool, or even running
through sprinklers in the yard.While your washing machine is happily humming along with a load of grimy
towels, transfer your clothes from the dryer to a retractable clothing line (a project I describe earlier in this chap-
ter) and load your hand-washed bathing suits onto the accordion rack to drip-dry over the sink. (Does this mean
you can cool off in the water twice as long?)

Align the screw holes of the brackets with your
predrilled holes, and screw the brackets to the
wall with a screwdriver.
Attach the accordion rack to the brackets by
snapping or sliding it in place or by twisting in
small screws provided with the kit.
Note: Some accordion racks come with a second
set of brackets so you can use the same accor-
dion rack in a second location, like the bathroom,
simply by unhooking it from the brackets.

Refreshing your laundry room’s décor
Life is messy. Mess creates laundry.
Laundry is reality. Now that you’ve come to
terms with the rhythm of laundry, you can
make the experience as enjoyable as possi-
ble. Here are some tips for revamping your
laundry room’s look:
 Zen or zippy? Paint your laundry room to
reflect how you want to feel in this
space. Light blue and sage green create
a soothing, peaceful space that will help
you get into the rhythm of folding.
Vibrant yellow, orange, and fuchsia will
add zip to the time you spend sorting.
Crisp navy or red stripes create a tidy
look and may help you iron those
creases extra straight.
 Soothe your subconscious. Use scented
plug-ins or scent diffusers to mask the
chemical smell of your space. The scent
of lavender will calm you, and citrus will
make you smile. When purchasing deter-
gent, select a scent that you love, or opt
for unscented products.
 Still bored? Why not add a radio, MP3
player, or wall-mounted TV to enhance
your time in this space? (Adding an addi-
tional phone line may be taking this con-
cept too far!)
 Do you have the right light? If you find
that you’ve missed a stain or two, con-
sider increasing the wattage of your light
bulbs or adding an additional light
source.
 Is your room a comfortable tempera-
ture? Set up a circulating fan to keep you
cool.
 If you tire easily, add a small chair or
stool to use while sorting or ironing.
Additionally, a padded rug or gel mat
will reduce leg strain if you stand up to
do your work.
 Don’t forget to outfit your room with a
small trash can for dryer sheets and lint.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Determine the wall location of your ironing board. When the board
is down and perpendicular to the wall, it shouldn’t interfere with
loading the washer and dryer, block the doorway of the room, or
trap you in a corner. Your ironing board also should be near an
outlet. If you have a positioning preference because you’re right-
handed or left-handed, take this into account too!
1
If you don’t want to iron a shirt, you probably don’t have to. You can invest
in wrinkle-free fabrics, embrace (or start!) the “slightly wrinkled” trend, use
a wrinkle-release product, or frequent dry cleaners. You also could remove
one item from your dryer at a time and race to hang it on a hanger before it
wrinkles.
For most folks, ironing is a way of life. Why not indulge your love of ironing
by adding a full-size, wall-mounted ironing board? The main benefit of a
wall-mounted board is that it stays in your laundry room — and enables
you to wash, dry, iron and fold all within the confines of this space. Think
about how much time you’ll save by completing all your laundering tasks
in a single space. When not in use, the fold-away ironing board folds up
against the wall and doesn’t take up any valuable square footage like a free-
standing ironing board.

Determine the height of your ironing board. Are
you tall or vertically challenged? Do you intend to
iron sitting down or standing up? If you want to
stand and iron, the board should be between
waist height and chest height, depending on your
preference. If you want to sit and iron, figure out
the height of your board while sitting on the stool
or chair that you’ll use. Use your measuring tape
and a pencil to make a note of your desired board
height in the location where you’ll hang it.
Use a stud finder to locate a wall stud where you
intend to hang your ironing board (see Chapter 3).
Use a pencil to mark the stud at the height deter-
mined in Step 2.
Hold the hanging mechanism up to the wall verti-
cally along the wall stud. Adjust the height of the
board so that the bottom of the board lines up
with the mark made in Step 3. Use your pencil to
make a mark through the hanging mechanism to
show you where to drill your holes. (If the holes
in the hanging mechanism are blocked by the
ironing board, detach the board from the hanging
mechanism and then mark the holes.)
Neglected irons, like many household
devices, pose a potential fire hazard.
Consider installing a smoke detector in your
laundry room to protect your family and
home.

Use a level to ensure that the marks made in Step 4
are even. 
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the hanging mechanism, drill
holes in all the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.
Ironing boards are generally very heavy. If some
or all of the bracket holes aren’t in a wall stud,
strength the installation by inserting drywall
anchors. Simply position an anchor into a
predrilled hole and tap with a hammer until the
anchor is almost completely in the hole.
Attach your hanging mechanism to the wall by
inserting the screws partway into the wall with a
screwdriver, sliding the mechanism onto the
screws, and fully tightening the screws. (Some
models require you to align the screw holes on the
hanging mechanism with the holes in the wall and
screw the unit in place using a screwdriver.) If nec-
essary, reattach the ironing board to the hanging
mechanism with a wrench or small screwdriver.

Hanging a Wall Cabinet for Laundry Supplies
Your laundry arsenal may go far beyond detergent and bleach to include
specific stain removers, color-safe bleaches, brighteners, whiteners . . . 
and the list goes on. Most laundry rooms have a horizontal surface such as
a ledge or shelf on which to store cleaning products, but if you don’t have
this or just need more space, adding an all-purpose wall cabinet can really
clean up your space!
I recommend selecting a sturdy cabinet from a home improvement store.
Ideally, the cabinet will have two doors and, if you like, an adjustable shelf
that allows you to accommodate items both large (detergent bottles) and
small (dryer sheets). Measure your tallest item, and ensure that your cabi-
net can easily accommodate this item. 
Make sure that a wall-mounted cabinet won’t be a hazard to all who enter;
laundry rooms are tight spaces, and heads can easily get bumped.

Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know

Determine the location and height of your wall
cabinet. The area above the washer, dryer, or sink
is ideal because this space otherwise would be
unused. If you’re installing your cabinet over a
top-loading washing machine or dryer, make sure
the bottom of the cabinet is high enough that you
can still open the machine door; around 20 inches
of clearance is usually safest. 
If you’re installing the cabinet on the opposite
wall from your machines, consider the head-
bumping hazard factor of upper cabinets in tight
spaces and install it so that the bottom of the cab-
inet is close to your height. Make sure that you
can access the contents at whatever height you
choose. If your cabinet is over a flat surface like a
table or counter, you don’t have to worry about
this hazard and can install your cabinet at a more
comfortable height, with the bottom of the cabi-
net a few inches below eye level. 
Factoring in all these considerations, mark the
ideal height of the bottom of the cabinet on the
wall with a pencil.
Use a stud finder to locate a wall stud and mark it
at the height determined in Step 1.
Measure and mark a second wall stud 16 inches
away from the first stud.
165

Use a level to ensure that the pencil marks made
in Steps 2 and 3 are at an even height.
This installation requires drilling through the
back of the cabinet and into the wall studs.
Measure and mark two points that are 16 inches
apart inside your cabinet. Ensure that the marks
are centered on the back of the cabinet and level
with each other. (For example, if your cabinet is
29 inches wide, subtract 16 from 29 so you have
13 inches total outside of the marks, or 61⁄2 inches
on each side.)
Align the marks on the inside of your cabinet with
the pencil marks made on the wall in Steps 2 and 3.
(You may need a helper to hold the cabinet in
place.) Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than
the screws required for this installation, drill
holes in all the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure. Drill two to three holes per
wall stud to support the heavy weight of the cabi-
net, and then screw the cabinet into the wall
studs.
Detergent bottles are known to drip! Line
the bottom of your cabinet with a heavy
duty shelf liner to protect it.

Setting up a sewing station
Think your laundry room can handle more?
If space permits, consider expanding your
laundry room to include a sewing station for
mending and other sewing tasks.
Begin with a sturdy, all-purpose rectangular
table that has access to a wall outlet and
doesn’t interfere with your laundry, ironing,
and drying racks. Mount a wall cabinet above
the table (refer to the project “Hanging a Wall
Cabinet for Laundry Supplies”), and add a
comfortable chair. Position your sewing
machine on the table, and fill your upper cab-
inet with your sewing kit, current projects,
and supplies. Add an “Inbox” for all the
incoming pieces of laundry that need repair.
The hum of the sewing machine should mix
well with the rattle of the dryer!

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Laundry Room
After you’ve installed one, some, or all the projects that appear earlier in this chap-
ter, it’s time to implement some organization techniques that help you keep loving
your laundry room. These sections provide some inspirational ideas for keeping the
flame alive.
Sorting your laundry
Laundry can be intimidating. Perhaps you were the kid in college with the pink
socks. I wasn’t that girl, but I did date that guy. To avoid laundry mishaps, have
everyone in your family deposit their dirty clothes into three bins in your laundry
room labeled “Lights,” “Darks,” and “Delicates.” The size of these bins depends on
how much space you have available in your laundry room and how often you do
laundry (translation: how much the bins need to hold). I recommend using medium-
size wire bins that hold about one load of laundry each — give or take. When a bin is
full, it’s time to do a load. Purchase bins small enough to fit in your space but large
enough to meet your laundry needs.
Here’s how the bin contents should break down:

Lights are anything that you can bleach and wash with hot water. Examples
are socks, men’s and children’s underwear, and preshrunk light-colored
cotton t-shirts. You can wash light-colored towels or linens with your light
clothing or separate them to prevent the transfer of fuzzy material from
your towels to clothing.

Darks are almost everything else, and they should be washed in cold water.
You can wash dark-colored towels with darks or separately from other laun-
dry to prevent the transfer of fuzzy material from your towels to clothing.
Wash new, brightly colored towels by themselves the first time to prevent
bleeding. You also can sort out black items to prevent fading and wash with
a special detergent made for black clothing.

Delicates are garments that need to be hand-washed and air-dried and are
generally of the female persuasion. This includes delicate garments such as
women’s underwear, bras, bathing suits, and nightgowns. Make sure all bra
and bathing suit hooks are closed, and put all delicate items in a mesh bag
to prevent them from snagging or hooking onto anything else.
If you plan to separate your towels or linens from your clothing on a regular basis,
consider adding a fourth bin labeled “Linens.” As with most home organization rou-
tines, do what works for you!
Before beginning any load, transfer items piece by piece from the bin to the washing
machine. Check each garment for loose buttons, rips, and stains; set those that need
mending aside in your sewing “Inbox” (see the earlier sidebar “Setting up a sewing
station”), and treat stains before washing with a stain remover. Don’t forget to
remove all loose items from the pockets — you don’t want to see what a single
167
Chapter 10: Learning to Love Your Laundry Room

crayon can do to a load of laundry! And keep in mind that just because your family
drags items into the laundry room doesn’t mean they can stay; return loose items to
each family member’s room as you return their clean laundry. Staying organized
takes discipline!
Stashing a few tools for folding and storage
Outfitting your laundry room with the following tools will minimize your folding and
storing time:

Use a flip-fold laundry board. Available online or at as-seen-on-TV mer-
chants, laundry lovers swear by this product! Use the board to help fold
laundry and get perfectly folded clothes and towels every time.
Alternatively, you can fold clothes on your wall-mounted ironing board,
counter, or side table.

Manage your hangers. Keep an extra supply of plastic hangers in your laun-
dry room on a wall-mounted hook (see Chapter 7 for the basics on mount-
ing a hook), and use them for clean clothing that needs to be hung. Each
time you grab a load of laundry from your bedroom closet, grab a stash of
hangers to restock the laundry room. This will save you many trips back
and forth!

Return clean clothing piles to each family member’s room. And if children
are old enough, let them put away their own laundry. By seeing how much
effort goes into putting clothing away, they’ll be less likely to throw clean
items in with the dirty clothes.

K
itchens are for cooking. Bedrooms are for sleeping. Living
rooms are for living. What are garages for? Traditionally,
garages were for parking cars, of course. They were man-spaces with
oil spills on the floor, clunky wood workbenches, and tons of greasy
tools. They stored items like fishing poles, lawnmowers, and garden-
ing tools.
Not anymore! Garages no longer have such a defined function. Instead
they serve as a catchall for the items that don’t fit in the rest of your
home. Today’s garages can take on any of a number of personalities;
here are just a few that may apply to your garage:

Old school garage: A place to park your car and hang your hammer.

Artist’s studio: A room dedicated to painting, ceramics, crafting, or garden-
ing; vast amounts of tools and supplies and not a car in sight!

Busy family: A space filled with balls, bats, bikes, backpacks, skis, roller
skates, and more; a hard-working room that has to accommodate warehouse-
quantity home goods (like a 24-pack of toilet paper and 12-pack of paper
towels), your kid’s science project volcano, and pet food.

Lounge: The look and feel of an indoor room, complete with flooring, furni-
ture, painted walls, and media.

Garage band: A space dedicated to everything teen!
If your garage is anything like mine, it’s a combination of the preceding garage per-
sonalities. Each homeowner has distinct needs, and each garage is unique. The goal
of this chapter is to equip you with all the know-how and ideas to create your ideal
garage based on the limitations of your space. This chapter encourages you to de-
clutter your garage, mount your equipment and tools on the wall, stow your sea-
sonal storage overhead, and create clever systems for dealing with all your supplies.
Trust me, you will see your garage floor again!
So what are some typical limitations of a garage? The most common is the amount 
of space that can actually be devoted to storage! As families grow and their needs
evolve, the garage is often the first room to be converted into a hobby room, teen
hangout, or workshop. In colder climates, it’s often necessary to park your car in
your garage, which leaves even less room for storage. Further limitations include
temporarily storing items for kids away at college, using your garage as a stock room
for your home-based business, or . . . not having a garage at all! This chapter details
several creative storage solutions that you can put to use in whatever garage space
you have available.

Part III: Organizing Secondary Spaces in Your Home 
By now the creative juices should be flowing! You’re developing a visual of your ideal
space, and you’re going to channel that energy into emptying the garage and sorting
through your stuff. Move the entire contents of your garage outside (if weather per-
mits) or into an adjacent room. This crucial step allows you to assess what you have
and enables you to quickly eliminate items that don’t support your goal. This task
may seem daunting, but you can accomplish it in less than half a day.
Garages hold enormous amounts of stuff. I recommend sorting your items into four
large piles labeled as follows:

STAY: This item is in good condition, is used often, is relevant to the goal,
and will stay in the garage. Examples are sporting equipment; tools; and
automotive, cleaning, and pet supplies.

MOVE: This item is in good condition and used often, but it doesn’t belong
in the garage. For example, seasonal clothing can be transferred to your
closet, and borrowed items should be returned to friends and family mem-
bers. (Don’t they have their own garages?)

SHARE: This item is in good condition but hasn’t been used in the last year,
is a duplicate, or no longer serves the garage’s goal. Examples include
boxes of old clothing, extra kitchen items, old sporting equipment, and fur-
niture you’re unlikely to use again someday.

GO: This item is trash! Examples are broken furniture, damaged items, and
empty cardboard boxes.
Creating a cleaning caddy
How do you clean your house? If you tend
to do frequent five-minute touch-ups or
have few bathrooms, you may keep clean-
ing supplies in each bathroom and under
the kitchen sink for easy access.
In most situations, people keep household
cleaning supplies in one central location and
use a portable caddy to travel with certain
supplies from room to room. This approach
is recommended if you have many bath-
rooms to service and it’s hard to stay on top
of stocking each room with supplies.
The garage is the ideal spot to keep your
household cleaning supply stash and clean-
ing caddy. Start with a large plastic tub, and
fill it with the following items:
 For the bathroom: Tile cleaner, mildew
cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, and soap
scum remover
 For the kitchen: Disinfectant spray,
granite cleaner if you have granite 
countertops, and stainless steel cleaner
if you have a stainless sink or appliances
 For the floors: Spot treatment, floor
cleaner, and floor polish
 For general purposes: Window cleaner,
all-purpose cleaning spray, scratch-
free cleansing powder, ammonia, goo
remover, baking soda, vinegar, bleach,
leather cleaner, and clean rags (which
are more environmentally friendly than
paper towels)
Purchase a large cleaning caddy that has a
handle; I recommend using a plastic caddy
because it’s waterproof and easier to clean
than a fabric one. Store the caddy in the
garage with your cleaning products until the
time comes to load it up with what you need
to clean a particular room or surface in the
house. For safety purposes, locate the caddy
on an upper shelf or in a upper cabinet.

171
Chapter 11: Giving New Life to Your Garage
Fixing up an empty garage
Does your space have that new-garage
smell? It’s not often that you find yourself
with a completely empty garage! Embrace
this rare opportunity by touching up the
walls and floors. Reframe the way you think
about your garage: If it looks more like a fin-
ished interior room, you’re more likely to
keep the space tidy and organized.
1. Evaluate your space and divide it into
zones.
 Measure your available wall space
and interior space. Storage should be
on the perimeter of your garage.
Estimate if and where you’ll park your
car, locate your workbench, and place
any lounge furniture.
 Determine which types of items you’ll
store in your garage, and carve out
your zones. Examples of zones are
garden, car parking, sporting equip-
ment, mudroom, pet center, work-
bench, and crafts.
2. Finish your concrete floors by trying one
of the following techniques:
 Cover your concrete floors with lami-
nate peel-and-stick tiles. They cost
about $1 per square foot and provide
a durable surface that you can still
park your car on.
 Buy a large area rug from a remnant
warehouse, and add a mesh anti-slip
mat underneath to help the rug stay
in place.
 Enhance the look of your floors with
concrete paint or epoxy. Select a color
that sets the tone for your space: Aqua
adds a “wow factor” to a lounge,
beige complements a calm gardening
space, and red energizes a teen’s
garage band. (On second thought,
maybe you shouldn’t choose red!)
3. Beautify your walls.
 Remove all hardware (nails, hooks,
and screws) from your walls.
 Repair 
any 
holes, 
cracks, 
or
imperfections.
 Add a fresh coat of paint. If you’re
striving to make your room to feel like
part of the home, select the same
color as the adjacent room. You may
already have a gallon of this paint on
hand anyway!
 If you plan to devote your garage to a
few main zones, paint each a different
color to emphasize the utility of each
space. For example, try a garden zone
painted green with a framed picture
of a thumb for inspiration!
4. Wrap up with finishing touches.
 Lighting is essential for a workspace.
Use this opportunity to add extra
overhead or task lighting to your
garage.
 Return to your garage any work-
benches, shelving units, and storage
carts that support your goal and
organization plan.
People love to hang on to old furniture, and it usually ends up gathering dust in the
garage. You may have wonderful intentions of refurbishing that old cabinet or fixing
the broken leg on the chair, but if it just isn’t getting done, consider donating these
items to charity. They’ll be refurbished and used rather than just take up space in
your garage.
After you sort your garage’s contents, choose the projects that will help you store
what’s in the “STAY” pile, and get to work! When you’re done, check out the section
“The Finishing Touches: Reassembling Your Garage” at the end of this chapter for
ideas on maintaining your garage’s organization.

Hanging a Tool Pegboard
A toolbox is great storage device for do-it-yourselfers and carpenters on the
go. It has a handle for easy transportation and can accommodate small items
like hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, wire cutters, nails, and screws. But
where do you put your 4-foot level?
A garage tool rack is a great supplement or replacement for a toolbox!
Pegboard tool racks are constructed from wood, plastic, or stainless steel
and can hold large items like drills, saws, and levels. When you’re working
on a project, small items like hammers and screwdrivers hang at arm’s
length.
Toolbox:
 Measuring tape
 Pencil
 Level
 Drill
 Drill bits
 Screws with heads
larger than the holes in
the pegboard
 Screwdriver
Materials:
 Pegboard (with spacers)
 Pegboard hooks or pegs
(for hanging tools)
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Hanging a large item such as a pegboard by yourself can be challenging,
so you may want to recruit a friend to help with this installation.

Select a location for your pegboard that’s above
your workspace. If you stand at your workbench,
locate the top of your pegboard a few inches
above eye-level. If you sit at your workbench,
locate the bottom of your pegboard flush to your
work surface. Use a measuring tape and mark
your chosen height with a pencil.
Locate a wall stud in your chosen location with a
stud finder, and mark it with a pencil.
173
Chapter 11: Giving New Life to Your Garage
Locate and mark additional wall studs 16 inches
to either side of the first wall stud.
Most pegboards don’t have a hanging mechanism
or bracket, so you have to drill through the peg-
board into the studs. Hold your pegboard up to
the marked wall studs and push a pencil through
the pegboard holes you’ll hang it from to indicate
where you’ll drill holes. If your pegboard spans
multiple studs, reinforce the strength of the instal-
lation by marking drill holes in both the top and
bottom of each stud.

Use your level to check the heights of the marked
holes and verify that the pegboard will hang level.
Ensure that your screws are narrow enough to fit
through the pegboard holes but have heads larger
than the pegboard holes. Using a drill bit that’s
slightly smaller than the screws, drill holes into
the wall studs at the marked spots, applying con-
sistent horizontal pressure.
174
Part III: Organizing Secondary Spaces in Your Home 
Position the pegboard against the wall and have a
helper hold it securely in place. Place a spacer
between the wall and the pegboard at each drilled
hole, and insert the screws through the pegboard
holes and spacers into each drilled hole and
screw them in with a screwdriver. (Spacers pro-
vide a gap between the wall and the pegboard for
the back ends of hooks and pegs used for hanging
tools.)
Outfit your pegboard with hooks or pegs on
which to hang your tools.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Grab a helper because this is a two-person job.You’re working with multiple
pieces overhead and up on a ladder.
Sometimes, wall storage in your garage isn’t enough, and you need to bring
out the big guns: ceiling racks! Ceiling racks are great for storing large or
infrequently used items, and they’re accessible by a ladder. A standard size
rack is 4-x-8 feet, which translates to 32 square feet of floor space. Multiply
this number by the distance from the rack to the ceiling, and your new
storage area will rival that of a walk-in closet!
You mount the frame of the unit into ceiling joists using attached brackets,
and the base connects to the frame. Installation is very simple . . . the hard
part is deciding how to fill up your new storage space!

Determine the location of your ceiling rack. Open
ceiling space is best, but note that you also can
install a ceiling rack in the unused space between
your garage door rails and your ceiling. Get on a
ladder and use a measuring tape to ensure that
there’s enough vertical space (at least 36 inches)
to locate your rack here and that it won’t interfere
with the operation of the garage door.
If you have low garage ceilings with less than 36
inches of clearance between the rails and ceiling
or any other obstacles that would interfere with a
rack, you should locate your ceiling rack on the
opposite end of the garage.
While you’re on a ladder, use a stud finder to
locate a ceiling joist in the area where you want 
to hang your rack. Note whether the joists run
north-south or east-west, and mark them with 
a pencil. (See Chapter 3 for an introduction to
ceiling joists.)
Move 16 inches in the appropriate direction
(determined in Step 2) to locate additional ceiling
joists with a stud finder, and mark them with a
pencil.
176

Hold the frame of the rack up to the ceiling and
mark the locations of the bracket mounting holes
along the joists with a pencil.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws provided for this installation, drill holes in
the marked spots, applying consistent vertical
pressure.
Use your ceiling rack storage area to house
items that you need to access infrequently.
This is a great place for your turkey deep-
fryer because nobody minds climbing a
ladder before Thanksgiving dinner, but resist
the temptation to store your lawnmower up
there! Camping equipment, holiday items,
and long-term storage paperwork are also
perfectly at home on ceiling racks.
Screw the brackets into the ceiling using a screw-
driver. Use a screwdriver or wrench, depending on
the model, to connect the frame to the brackets.
Complete the installation by attaching the grid to
the rack by snapping or screwing it in place. Then
load up your rack!

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Overhead installation is always cumbersome, so grab a helper for this
installation!
As gas prices soar, people are turning to their bikes as an excellent way to
cut down on the high cost of gasoline, squeeze in a little exercise, and have
fun while doing it. Another perk of biking? You never have to circle for a
parking spot!
Bicycles are typically stored in the garage to prevent rust and corrosion.
Bike lifts free up valuable garage space by raising the bike to ceiling height
with a lift that attaches directly to the ceiling. The lift holds the handlebars
and seat of your bike, and a pulley system helps you lower or raise your
bike. Bike lifts are great for homeowners with high ceilings in their garages
or for those who rarely use their bikes.

Determine the location of your bike lift. Your bike
will hang approximately 48 inches from the ceil-
ing, so pick a spot where the bike won’t interfere
with a walkway, workbench, or the garage door.
Get up on your ladder and measure 48 inches
down from the ceiling in your chosen spot to
ensure you have enough room.
Do you know that a bike lift can accommo-
date items other than bikes? Consider
installing a lift to store bulky items like
strollers, lightweight gardening equipment,
and camping gear. Make sure the item you
plan to hang is stable enough to be sup-
ported by two hooks.
Use a stud finder to locate a ceiling joist that’s far
enough from the wall it faces that the tires won’t
bump into the wall. This distance is approxi-
mately 16 inches for standard adult bikes, but you
will want to verify this measurement for your own
bike. Mark the location with a pencil.
Determine if the ceiling joist found in Step 2 is run-
ning the length of your bike or perpendicular to
the length of your bike (north-south or east-west).
If the joist runs the length of your bike, you don’t
need to find any additional joists. If the joist runs
perpendicular to the length of your bike, measure
16 inches away from the first joist to locate and
mark additional ceiling joists. Three should do it!

Hold the seat hanging mechanism up to the first
ceiling joist found in Step 2, and mark through the
screw holes on the bracket to indicate where to
drill your holes.
Determine the location of your second hanging
mechanism, which holds the handle bars. If
you’re working with multiple joists, I recommend
using the third ceiling joist (two away from the
one marked in Steps 2 and 4) because the dis-
tance from the bike handle bars to the back of the
seat is about 32 inches, which is exactly equal to
the distance between the first and third joists. (If
you’re working along a single joist, you can just
measure 32 inches along the joist.) 
Hold the handle bar hanging mechanism up to this
location and mark through the screw holes on the
bracket to indicate where to drill your holes.
Use a carpenter’s square to ensure that the
marked spots for both hanging mechanisms are
perpendicular to the wall of your garage.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the hanging mechanisms, drill
holes in the marked spots, applying consistent
vertical pressure.

Screw the hanging mechanisms into the ceiling
joists using a screwdriver. You may want to have
one person hold the bracket against the ceiling
while the other person screws it in place.
Connect the clamps and pulley system to the ceil-
ing brackets.
Attach the clamps to the seat and handle bars of
your bike. Use the pulley system to lift the bike to
the ceiling and free up some floor space. (Some
models provide a hook that you can mount to the
wall to hold the excess length of cord.)

Chapter 11: Giving New Life to Your Garage
If your family bikes frequently and you don’t want to use a lift, you have other options for storing your bikes.
Bike stands, for instance, hold bikes upright by trapping the front wheel.They’re a great solution for children’s
bikes because kids can get their bikes in and out by themselves. Bike stands require light assembly but no instal-
lation; they simply stand on the floor. In addition, bike hooks and racks are ideal for storing teen or adult bikes.
Bike hooks hold a bike by the tire, and bike racks support a bike under the carriage; both are mounted into a
wall stud and can hold up to 50 pounds.

Creating a Zone for Sports Equipment
Growing up, I played soccer, and my husband played basketball. We just
assumed our kids would follow our lead and choose a sport with a nice
round ball. So much for assumptions! Our kids love every sport and want
to try a new one each season. They also love a variety of ways to get
around town — scooters, skateboards, roller skates, inline skates, and even
rolling shoes!
Although we enjoy our kids’ enthusiasm for all things athletic, storing
sporting equipment is taxing on the garage. Do you face the same dilemma?
Why not create a sports zone in an unused area of your garage? You should
allow at least 4 horizontal feet of storage space to accommodate storage
components for all your sporting equipment.
Maximize your storage by dividing your sports zone into four layers. From
top to bottom, I recommend a set of wall hooks to accommodate seasonal
items like skis; a peg rack for helmets, jump ropes, and sports bags; a
sports equipment cage to corral balls and bats; and a large sturdy tub to
hold items like skateboards, roller skates, and tennis rackets. Add extra
cages and tubs to suit the needs of your children.

Stuff You 
Need to Know

Determine the location of your sports zone, and
locate four or more wall studs with a stud finder,
marking them with a pencil. I recommend marking
each wall stud in a few different spots, starting a
few inches from the ceiling.
For the top level (wall hooks), use your measuring
tape to mark 6 inches below the ceiling on the
first and fourth studs (which should be 48 inches
apart). If you plan to hang only children’s skis,
mark the first and third studs (which should be 32
inches apart).
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws on the twist-in hooks, drill holes in the
marked spots (one hole for each hook), applying
consistent horizontal pressure.
Twist hooks into the holes. If you have several
pairs of skis or other seasonal equipment to 
hang, repeat to add more hooks 8 inches below
the first set.
183

For the second level (the rack with individual pegs/
hooks for hanging helmets, jump ropes, and sports
bags), measure and mark two or three wall studs
approximately 8 inches below the last row of hooks.
Hold your peg rack to the wall so that at least one
hanging mechanism is in line with a mark made in
Step 5. Use your pencil to mark through the screw
holes of the hanging mechanisms.
Use your level to ensure that the pencil marks are
even and the rack will hang level.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the peg rack installation, drill
holes in the marked spots, applying consistent
horizontal pressure.

If one of your hanging mechanisms isn’t in a stud,
use drywall anchors to reinforce the installation.
Simply position the drywall anchor into the hole,
and tap with a hammer until the anchor is almost
completely in the hole.
Hold your peg rack to the wall and screw it in
place using a screwdriver.
For the third level (the sports equipment cage),
position the top of your sports equipment cage at
least 18 inches below the bottom of the peg rack
to allow for items like bike helmets hanging on the
pegs. Mark the height of the cage on the second
and third wall studs.
Involve your kids! After you put together
your sports zone, have your children outfit it
with their favorite gear. Ensure that the
most frequently used items are placed at
their height and less frequently used items
(like skis) are stored toward the top.
185
Chapter 11: Giving New Life to Your Garage

11

Hold the sports equipment cage to the wall in
such a way that the top is at the height deter-
mined in Step 11 and the hanging mechanisms
line up with the second and third wall studs.
(Standard cages are 20 inches wide with the hang-
ing mechanisms located 16 inches apart, so both
hanging mechanisms mount into wall studs.) Stick
your pencil through the screw holes of the hang-
ing mechanisms to mark where to drill your holes.
Use a level to ensure that the marks for both
hanging mechanisms are level.
Using a drill bit that’s slightly smaller than the
screws required for the cage hanging mecha-
nisms, drill holes in the marked spots, applying
consistent horizontal pressure.
Hold your sports equipment cage to the wall and
screw it in using a screwdriver. You can hang a
second cage below or next to the first cage by
repeating these steps.
Slide an extra large, sturdy, plastic tub on the
floor below the equipment cage to store equip-
ment that’s challenging to wall-mount, like inline
skates, skateboards, and collapsible scooters.

The Finishing Touches: Reassembling 
Your Garage
After you install one, some, or all the projects that appear earlier in this chapter, it’s
time to put your garage back together again. The following sections provide some
inspirational ideas for filling up all your new storage space!
How does your garden grow? Organizing
your gardening supplies
An organized garden area will get you from your garage to your geraniums in sec-
onds! Begin with storing your tools on the wall:

Tall tools can be stored in a trash can dedicated to gardening, on a wall rack
that grips the tools, or in sturdy wall-mounted hooks spaced a few inches
apart.

Small tools can hang from a simple peg rack or hook or be stored in a small
bucket.
If you have a few shelves on a rack or in a cabinet that you can devote to small gar-
dening accessories, great! If you’re creating an entirely new area, position a simple
wood shelf against a wall, and add a durable, washable area rug to define the space.
Then customize your area by doing the following:

Group loose seed packets in a zippered bag or waterproof box to prevent
damage from moisture. Group your collection by planting season (later
winter, early spring, and late spring), or alphabetize them for easy access!

Nest ceramic pots so that they take up less space.

Utilize a waterproof garden caddy for all your grab-and-go items, such as
gloves, knee pads, and handheld tools.

Stash a wide-brimmed hat and sunscreen near your caddy.

Add a large plastic tub in the lower section of your storage area to corral
dirty items, such as potting soil, outdoor shoes, knee pads, and gloves.

Add a large plastic tub exclusively for poisonous items on the highest shelf
or in a remote location that children and pets can’t access. For safety’s
sake, the tub should have a locking lid and be labeled “Poisonous.”

Place a stainless steel trash can on the floor. It’s a great home for tall, dirty
tools, fertilizer, or potting soil.
Organizing your automotive supplies
By the time you trek through your house and garage to collect your glass cleaner,
rags, chamois, dashboard protector, and handheld vacuum, wouldn’t it have been
easier to go to the carwash? Not anymore! And certainly not at the prices they
charge! Save time and money by creating a custom car care caddy in your garage.
187
Chapter 11: Giving New Life to Your Garage

Start with a sturdy, rolling base. Folding carts, wagons, and tiered utility carts are
good options. Purchase an item that’s sturdy enough to hold tools, if necessary.
Then purchase a large, round, plastic caddy that has a handle. Because you’ll likely
be doing automotive projects on your driveway, locate your caddy on the shelf near-
est to the garage door that leads to the driveway. For safety purposes, locate the
caddy on a higher shelf to prevent children or pets from accessing any dangerous
chemicals or tools.
Purchase cleaning products and accessories specifically dedicated to car care:

Products: Glass cleaner, all-purpose surface cleaner, carpet cleaner, and wax
or polish

Cleaning implements: Sponges, rags, chamois, squeegees, brushes, and old
toothbrushes

Miscellaneous: A handheld vacuum and extension cord
Place these items on your rolling base (except for the chemicals, which should be
kept high up out of the reach of children and animals), and transfer only what you
need to your portable caddy when you’re ready to work on your vehicle.
If you perform your own oil changes and automotive repairs, create a service kit in
your cart to reduce prep time; as with the items in the previous list, transfer only
what you need to the portable caddy when you’re ready to work on your vehicle:

Products: Motor oil, replacement fluids, air filters, and other small replace-
ment parts

Tools: Wrenches, funnel, dipstick, and other car-specific tools

Miscellaneous: Hand degreaser

t’s my hope that this book dispels the common myth that organization takes too
much time! By investing a few focused work hours now, you can shave minutes or
even hours off your daily routine. This chapter provides ten tricks of the organizing
trade that will help you complete tasks faster. The perk? You’ll have more time for
the things you want to do.
Keep Your Tools Handy
When you have a few room organizations under your belt, you see that the process
doesn’t take that long! You can further reduce the time it takes to transform a space
by having your organizing tools ready to go when inspiration strikes. I recommend
grouping your tools together in the following categories and keeping them in your
garage to reduce your project prep time:

Sorting tools: Stack your four sorting bins inside of one another, and tuck
colored paper, markers, garbage bags, and lids into the bins.

Installation tools: Create your own do-it-yourself tool kit to store the tools
you most frequently use. This grab-and-go kit makes project installation a
cinch!

Finishing tools: Dedicate a space in your garage to finishing touches, such
as bins, boxes, baskets, picture frames, candles, and vases. As you switch
around your room décor, check out your garage stash before shopping for
accessories. You may want to store your paint supplies in this area as well.
Flip to Chapter 2 for more details on gathering basic organizing tools.

192
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Plan Convenient Spaces
Planning your spaces saves valuable time! When establishing the layout of a space,
envision how you’re going to work in the space. For example, set up your home
office so that everything is at arm’s length — you can type, answer the phone, use
your printer, recycle, and access your files all without leaving your office chair.
Here’s another example: In your kitchen, locate frequently used items at eye level
and rarely used appliances on upper shelves or in lower cabinets. Store your food in
a cabinet or pantry that’s within the kitchen triangle formed by the sink, refrigerator,
and stove. Store less frequently used items, such as plastic storage items or specialty
dishes, outside of the kitchen triangle.
Be Mentally Focused When You Organize
Are you inspired to tackle a room organization? Great! Clear your calendar and turn
off your phone so you can really focus. You can accomplish more in one hour of
focused work than in four hours of interrupted efforts. When you decide to sort
through the mounds of items in a room, quickly sort items into their respective bins,
and make quick decisions of STAY, MOVE, SHARE, or GO. Try to keep your STAY pile
as small as possible by keeping only essential documents or items that you need to
take action on. Remember that, if necessary, most information is easily found online.
This isn’t the time to contemplate old photos and letters and take a stroll down
memory lane!
Stick to the Idea of “One In, One Out”
Organizing an entire room is a lot of work. After you’ve done the work and everything
is in its place, you’ll have a good idea of how much stuff the room can comfortably
hold. If you don’t curb your inflow of goods, it won’t be long before you’re right back
where you started! Nip this vicious cycle in the bud by sticking to the principle of
“One in, one out.” If you buy a new picture frame, an old one has to go. The reverse,
“One out, one in,” also works; for example, if you break a lamp, you’re free to buy
another one to replace it. No fair breaking a lamp just to get a new one, though!
Repurpose Items
The needs of a household are ever-changing. There’s a phase where your wardrobe
takes center stage and a time when baby food jars need to be organized and accessi-
ble. Before long, you’re into sports equipment, running a home-based business, and

then back to the wardrobe. It’s the cycle of life. While clever home organization
stores sell a product for every need, repurposing your items as needs change is
better on the environment and your pocketbook. There’s no reason why a wood toy
box can’t be used for storing gardening tools or an old Ping-Pong table can’t have a
new life as an architect’s drafting table or a place to spread out and work on crafts. If
you have a keen eye and a bit of imagination, you can repurpose almost anything,
and you’ll save time and money, too!
Forget Spring Cleaning
Whoever thought of spring cleaning must have lived in one dirty place! Dirt, dust,
clutter, and unnecessary items build up all year long. I like to do a quick decluttering
of each closet in my house every few months. Logical times to tidy up your home are
after the holidays, before summer, and before school starts. Hitting your closets at
least three times a year helps you stay on top of clothes that are outdated or too
small and allows you to rotate your seasonal items. To quote Benjamin Franklin, 
“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Make Time to Plan Your Day
Are you a morning person? Good for you! You can get up at 5 a.m. and have the day
planned before your charges stumble bleary-eyed into the kitchen for waffles. If you
do your best work only after you’re fully awake, you should probably plan your day
the night before. Get in the habit of taking a few extra minutes in the evening to
review the next day’s activities and obligations and prepare yourself. For instance, 
if I notice that I’m supposed to bring cupcakes to my daughter’s class the next day,
I’d rather shop for ingredients the night before!
Keep Plenty of Lists
Back in the old days, I never made lists. I roamed through stores searching for
Christmas gifts, new shoes, or ingredients that would somehow come together to
form dinner. If I forgot something, it was no big deal — I could always shop again the
next day. Now that I’m a busy wife and a mother, I’m a firm believer in lists. Lists get
the job done. You can organize them by store (grocery, home goods, home improve-
ment) or by function (errands, gifts, projects). Find a list system that works for you,
and stick to it! Whenever I find myself scraping the bottom of the jar of smooth
peanut butter, I add it the grocery list immediately so my children don’t have to
suffer through a crunchy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The horror!
193
Chapter 12: Ten Time-Saving Organization Tips

Use One Central Calendar 
and Message Board
I recommend maintaining a single household calendar that encompasses work,
school, sports, and church activities as well as other social engagements. If every-
thing is in one place, you’re less likely to have schedule conflicts or overlook hiring
a babysitter. Here are a few suggestions for using a calendar and message board
effectively:

As events are added to the calendar, add related items to your to-do list or
gift list.

Post frequently used phone numbers like the local pizza joint and emer-
gency contact/medical information.

If you have room, tack up flyers, invitations, or coupons. Stay on top of
coupon expiration dates or event dates to prevent your message board from
becoming a clutter trap!
Don’t have a message board? Fear not; I show you how to mount one in your kitchen
in Chapter 5.
Pre-pack Bags for Last-Minute Events
Do you love spontaneity? Great! Embrace this character trait and prepare pre-
packed bags so you can act on your spontaneity. Here are a few ideas:

Fill a tote bag with towels, swimsuits, sunscreen, hats, toys, snack bars, and
bottled water, and store it in your trunk in the summertime. You can hit the
beach or pool at a moment’s notice!

Store your inline skates, protective gear, workout clothes, and a pair of
socks in your car so a scenic drive can morph into an impromptu workout.

Throw a wrapped hostess gift — something that won’t melt or spoil, such as
stationery, a picture frame, or potpourri — in your car for those times when
a cellphone call leads you to a last-minute dinner party. Put a sticky note on
the outside to remind you of the contents — just remember to remove it
before giving the gift!

Ten Tips for Maximizing Small Spaces
In This Chapter
 Using organizing gadgets
 Making the most of what you have
A
re you in a small space by necessity or by choice? This chapter provides you
with ten tips to organize the space you do have. Your cozy cottage or apart-
ment will feel like a million bucks!
Incorporate Sneaky Seating
Add some sneaky seating to your living room by using storage cubes or ottomans.
When not in use, they can store magazines, books, or toys, and serve as end tables.
When guests come over, create conversation areas by strategically placing the
cubes around the room.
Stash Discs in Media Folders
No room to store your CDs, DVDs and video game discs? Consider using media stor-
age folders. I recommend one folder for each type of media, and don’t forget to
label them! (Chapter 4 has more information.)
Mount Your Kitchen Items on the Walls
Is your kitchen about to burst? Free up your pots and pans drawer with a ceiling-
mounted rack. Want more? Pare down the contents of your utensil drawer with a 
wall-mounted rack. Still not impressed? Transfer spices to metal canisters on 
a wall-mounted magnetic strip. Not challenged yet? Eliminate your junk drawer 
by returning every item to its proper home. Gotcha! (Chapter 5 has a variety of
kitchen projects.)
Use Double-Decker Storage
Shelf stackers double the storage of a kitchen cabinet by creating an upper level to
hold a second row of cups or glasses. You also can load up a double-decker Lazy

196
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Susan two levels high with spices or condiments and spin it around to find the right
one. (Chapter 5 has details on kitchen gadgets.)
Make the Most of Your Table
How can you fit eight people at a six-person table? Consider a table with leaves to
allow for additional seating. If you’re not in the market for a new table, replace the
chairs on one side of your table with a bench and squeeze in a few extra people.
Consider Clever Sleeping Options
In your grandparents’ day, people raised a family of seven in a three-bedroom house.
Plenty of families continue to make it work in small houses today. How? You can set
up a bunk bed; loft the beds; or install a Murphy bed, which flips up inside a closet
or wall unit.
Include Rods and Hangers in Your Closets
If you have a small closet, it’s time to get creative! Try the following tips to get more
items in your closet while keeping it tidy (see Chapter 6 for details):

Suspend a lower clothing rod from your upper rod to increase hanging space.

Mount specialty hangers on your wall to organize belts, ties, and scarves.

Use pant/skirt hangers to hang up to five pants or skirts from a single hanger.
Hang Bathroom Items on the Walls
Running out of counter space in your bathroom? Maximize the space you have by
wall-mounting your hair dryer, curling iron, and flat iron. Hang them from a rack or a
series of hooks.
Build Under-the-Bed Storage
Want an extra 31 square feet of storage? Of course you do! Maximize the space
underneath your bed by adding risers for extra height and using under-the-bed
boxes. Chapter 9 shows you how to create rolling storage boxes using plywood.
Store Out-of-Season Items on Ceiling Racks
Are all your storage areas maxed out? Make the most of the height in your space by
installing ceiling racks. They’re great for storing holiday decorations or paperwork
in the garage (see the project in Chapter 11) or off-season clothing in your closet.
