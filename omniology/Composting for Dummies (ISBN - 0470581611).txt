About the Author
Cathy Cromell is the Southwest regional reporter for the National 
Gardening Association (NGA). She completed the Master Composter 
and Master Gardener certification programs at the University of 
Arizona Maricopa County Cooperative Extension Urban 
Horticulture Department in Phoenix, where she also absorbed 
abundant hands-on experience hoisting tons of organic matter 
while overseeing the composting area of the Master Gardener 
Demonstration Garden.
As editor of Arizona Master Gardener Press at the Cooperative 
Extension, Cathy produced gardening books that received numer-
ous awards. She was also a writer for Better Homes and Gardens 
New Garden Book and a contributing writer for Gardening in the 
Southwest (Sunset Books).
As garden editor-at-large for Phoenix Home & Garden magazine, Cathy 
enjoys helping readers — especially newcomers to the desert — 
uncover the mysteries of arid land growing conditions in her 
monthly article, Desert Gardening 101. She also scouts earth-friendly 
landscapes around the Southwest to feature in the magazine’s Garden 
Talks profile. “I’ve never encountered a gardener who wasn’t delighted 
to share their plant passions and gardening knowledge. Their generos-
ity and enthusiasm inspire me to tell their stories.”
The National Gardening Association (NGA) is committed to sus-
taining and renewing the fundamental links between people, plants, 
and the earth. Founded in 1972 as “Gardens for All” to spearhead the 
community garden movement, today’s NGA promotes environmental 
responsibility, advances multidisciplinary learning and scientific
literacy, and creates partnerships that restore and enhance 
communities.
NGA is best known for its garden-based curricula, educational materi-
als, international initiatives, and several youth garden grant pro-
grams. Together, these reach more than 300,000 children nationwide 
each year. NGA’s Web sites, one for home gardeners and another for 
those who garden with kids, build community and offer a wealth of 
custom content.

Dedication
To my parents, Patricia and William Cromell. Thank you for instill-
ing me with a love of plants and nature that has sustained and nour-
ished me throughout my life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Suzanne DeJohn and the National Gardening 
Association for this opportunity to write about one of my favorite 
gardening topics — the inestimable benefits of rotting organic 
matter.
My appreciation to the exceptionally capable folks at Wiley Publishing 
who helped lift this project off the ground, starting with acquisitions 
editor Mike Baker, who championed an entire book about composting. 
Project editor Elizabeth Rea performed a superlative job organizing 
the contents to flow logically for readers. Copy editor Christy 
Pingleton gave an exemplary performance polishing my rambling text. 
My thanks, also, to Sue Fisher for her comprehensive technical review 
and to Barbara Frake for her finely detailed illustrations.
I’m fortunate to know dozens of talented gardeners and horticulture 
professionals who generously share their knowledge and expertise 
with me. I offer special thanks to Carolyn Chard, Frank Martin, and 
Annette Weaver, who many years ago infected me with a virulent 
dose of their enthusiasm for composting; to Jo Cook, Mike Hills, and 
Kirti Mathura, who respond to my midnight e-mails with good 
humor and precise detail; and to Robyn Baker, Louisa Ballard, and 
Kathy Green, who remind me of all the truly important things in a 
plant addict’s life.
I extend my deep appreciation to Lucy K. Bradley, PhD, who once 
upon a time graciously invited me to accompany her down the 
garden writer’s path. Her creative vision and optimism continue to 
inspire me even though she moved to a land far, far away. I continue 
to be the lucky recipient of Nancy Erdman’s good humor as my 
long-time editor at Phoenix Home & Garden magazine. Finally, I am 
especially grateful to my sister, Patricia S. Piasecki, who is a kind 
soul I can always rely upon. If only she lived in the same time zone, 
I would gladly turn her compost pile every week month few months 
once in a while.

Introduction
E
nvironmental issues and green living have experienced an 
upswing in popular interest in recent years, and composting 
is right in the thick of it. Recycling organic wastes where they’re 
generated, rather than transporting them to a landfill, is an integral 
part of today’s earth-friendly lifestyle. Compost, the premium-
quality end product of this process, offers a terrific bonus for your 
garden and landscape.
As a child growing up in Minnesota, I recall using a hand trowel to 
easily scoop out a transplant hole in our vegetable garden’s loamy 
soil, but the growing season was all too brief. In Arizona, my hole-
digging may start with a pickaxe, but I’m spoiled by year-round gar-
dening. Although growing conditions differ radically from region to 
region or country to country, the basics of enriching garden beds 
with compost to produce healthy vegetables and flowers apply 
wherever you live. I hope this book helps you become a compost-
ing convert and more successful gardener.
About This Book
This book is for people who, like Rumpelstiltskin of fairy tale fame, 
want to turn straw into gold. Well, black gold anyway, which is 
what savvy gardeners call their compost. This book gives you the 
keys to transform what some see as useless organic refuse — yard 
trimmings, grass clippings, kitchen scraps, and of course, straw — 
into a valuable stash of black, crumbly compost for improving your 
soil and nourishing your plants.
If you picked up this book out of curiosity and composting is new 
to you, don’t feel intimidated. There’s nothing difficult or mysteri-
ous about it: Everything organic decomposes eventually. This book 
guides you every step of the way to help your composting process 
be productive and trouble-free.
Conventions Used in This Book
You can compost organic matter in all sorts of receptacles. I use 
the terms bin, container, and unit interchangeably to signify some-
thing that corrals your compost materials more neatly than a free-
standing heap.

Composting For Dummies

When I mention county cooperative extension office, I’m referring to 
university-sponsored outreach programs in the United States that 
are free to the public in all 50 states. Many offices also train Master 
Gardener volunteers to answer questions about composting as 
well as other horticultural topics. Canadian Master Gardener vol-
unteers are affiliated with varied organizations, including universi-
ties and public gardens. Use your favorite Internet search engine to 
locate these programs in your region.
You’ll find the following other conventions used throughout this 
book to call attention to specific information:
 
✓ New terms being defined are highlighted in italics.
 
✓ Boldfaced text indicates the action part of numbered steps or 
key text in bulleted lists.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
Feel free to skip anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon or 
appearing in a shaded sidebar. I think this information is interest-
ing, but you don’t have to know it to be a successful composter.
Foolish Assumptions
I think it’s a tad rude to make assumptions about you when we’ve 
never met, but my publisher insists! So, here’s what I assumed 
about you in writing this book:
 
✓ You want to save money by producing your own nutrient-rich 
compost to use as a soil amendment or to enhance soil fertility.
 
✓ You want to generate lots of lovely compost to grow the best 
flower, vegetable, or herb beds in the neighborhood.
 
✓ You’re concerned about the environment and want to do your 
part to reduce the amount of organic waste sent to landfills.
 
✓ You follow the philosophy of “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” in other 
areas of your life and want to add composting to the list.
 
✓ You want a family-friendly activity that helps your children (or 
grandchildren) understand nature’s own recycling process.
 
✓ You don’t live where local government offers collection of 
kitchen scraps or food waste for community composting.
 
✓ You want to get more exercise and fresh air, while still doing 
something productive!

How This Book Is Organized
This book is separated into five major parts, each one covering a 
general topic related to composting. Take a look at the part sum-
maries that follow, and head to whatever part sounds like it best 
addresses your composting needs.
Part I: Composting Basics
If you’re curious as to why composting matters, this part starts with 
an explanation of the problems caused by sending yard trimmings 
and kitchen waste to landfills. It describes how you can help allevi-
ate those problems by composting organic waste at home. In this 
part I also cover the basic tools needed to compost. Rotting organic 
matter provides a livelihood for billions of decomposer organisms, 
and they receive their 15 minutes of fame in this part as well.
Part II: Selecting a Home and 
Method for Your Compost
Here’s where you get help to decide where to compost: above-
ground, in a hole, or within the confines of a container. Or perhaps 
you’ll take up kitchen composting, which also uses containers. In 
addition to a rundown of your manufactured container options, 
this part also includes a chapter on the variety of containers you 
can construct yourself.
Part III: Compost Happens
Flip to this section to find out what ingredients can go into your 
compost pile, what stays out, and how to mix it all up in the right 
proportions based upon your schedule. You also get recommenda-
tions on what to do with all that compost you’re churning out.
Part IV: Expanding Your 
Compost Horizons
These chapters describe other methods to process kitchen waste 
or add organic matter to the soil. I explain vermicomposting — 
working with composting worms that eat your garbage. If you 
want to add more organic matter to your soil than your traditional 
compost pile can generate, take a look at the chapters in this part 
explaining cover crops or green manures, and sheet composting or 
composting mulch.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Head straight to the troubleshooting tips if your compost pile isn’t 
cooperating with you. You’ll also find the answers to ten quick 
FAQs for an overview of composting basics.
Icons Used in This Book
This book contains icons that flag noteworthy bits of information. 
This is the type of information you can expect from these icons:
 
This is where I include easy-to-follow suggestions to save you time, 
effort, or money. They include a few gems from my own experience 
that I wish someone had shared with me years ago!
 
This is the need-to-know, key information to retain about 
composting.
 
This icon serves as an alert to avoid potentially unpleasant or 
unsafe activities. It also steers you clear of practices that impede 
your efforts to produce compost in a timely fashion.
 
Sometimes it’s helpful or fun to understand a little more than 
“how-to” information and delve into the “whys” behind a particular 
process. This icon highlights information that you don’t need to 
know but may find useful.
Where to Go from Here
I hope you’re excited to dive into composting. And I hope you aren’t 
afraid of doing something wrong. Decomposition of organic matter 
is a natural process that’s going to happen regardless of what you 
do. But you can help it along, so this book guides you along the most 
direct path to problem-free composting. It’s designed so that you can 
absorb info from any chapter that catches your eye.
If you want to understand how decomposition really happens and 
are interested in microscopic organisms, head straight to Chapter 3. 
If you want to start composting with the least amount of effort, 
check out Chapter 4, which describes a freestanding heap. If you’re 
curious about containers, jump to Chapters 5 and 6. If you’re look-
ing for a fun activity with kids (that might teach them a little some-
thing when they aren’t suspecting it), check out Chapter 10 on 
composting with worms. Otherwise, thumb through the book until 
something catches your fancy.

Part I
Composting Basics

In this part. . . 
T
his part is designed for people who like to “begin at 
the beginning.” It leads off with a discussion of the 
wide-ranging benefi ts of composting, to you and your garden, 
your local community, and yes, even the planet. I don’t 
bombard you with statistics, but I hope this information 
inspires you to become a compost convert.
I also include lists of a few items that keep you safe and 
sound while composting, as well as the minimal tools 
required for maintaining your pile. I introduce you to the 
fascinating — and crowded — world of the soil food web 
that is alive and thriving in your compost pile. You discover 
a varied cast of characters, such as sweet-smelling bacteria 
and scared roly-polies. You may work up a healthy sweat 
turning your compost pile, but it’s the billions of minuscule 
creatures living within it that are doing the real heavy 
lifting.

Chapter 1
Digging into Compost
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the basics of composting
▶ Meeting the decomposers
▶ Recognizing the benefits
Y
ou can’t fail at composting. Isn’t that a nice thing to know at 
the start of a project? Organic matter will rot no matter what 
you do. Fuss over it daily or ignore it for months; it doesn’t matter. 
So, dig right in and enjoy the process!
This chapter defines a few terms, briefly introduces the soil food 
web, and gives you a quick description of hot and cold composting 
methods. The remainder of the chapter covers some of the many 
benefits of compost and composting.
Welcome to the World of Compost
Decomposition of organic matter is an essential biological process 
that’s ongoing in every nook and cranny of the planet. Composting 
is a method for you to copy nature’s process, speeding it up if you 
so choose, to ultimately reap a rich mound of soil-enhancing com-
post for your landscape.
What compost is
A beneficial, soil-like substance, compost is a mixture of decayed 
and decaying organic matter that improves soil structure and pro-
vides nutrients for plants.
If compost is the end product of your composting effort, what, 
then, is humus? Compost and humus are terms that are often used 
interchangeably, although there are subtle differences. Have you 
ever taken a stroll in the woods and uncovered fallen leaves to spy 

Part I: Composting Basics  
8
a rich layer of crumbly, sweet-smelling, black earth? That’s humus, 
which is comprised of well-decomposed plant and animal matter. 
Resembling dark coffee grounds, humus is aromatic, lightweight, 
and spongy in texture, allowing it to hold water.
Compost resembles humus but is comprised of materials in vari-
ous stages of decomposition. Some may be broken down quickly; 
others may require multiple rounds of destruction from varied spe-
cialized microorganisms and soil invertebrates. A pile of compost 
may contain some humus, but there’s still plenty of work available 
in the heap for the decomposers.
 
Don’t let the fact that not all the contents of your compost are 
fully decomposed stop you from incorporating compost into your 
garden. In fact, it’s a good thing to do because your compost’s 
abundant microbial activity provides benefits to your soil, which I 
cover later in the chapter.
What tools and equipment you need
You don’t need to buy a lot of stuff to begin composting. In fact, you 
could get started with nothing more than that old shovel propped in 
the corner of your shed or garage. However, it’s much easier —
and more entertaining — with a few well-chosen implements, such 
as a pitchfork and compost thermometer. I describe the most useful 
tools to enhance your composting experience later in Part I. The 
list is short, so no need to worry if your wallet is thin!
You may also have questions about compost bins. Are they essen-
tial? No, but depending on style, containers use space efficiently, 
provide a tidy appearance, and help you maintain moisture and 
heat within your heap of organic matter, ultimately producing com-
post faster. Some container styles also do a good job of deterring 
pests, if that’s a concern where you live. In Part II, I cover charac-
teristics of all sorts of home-built and manufactured bins and offer 
guidance for selecting the ideal container for your needs.
How composting works
Composting works best when you mix up the right combinations 
of organic matter and living conditions for the soil microorganisms 
and invertebrates performing all the decomposing work.
It may be easy to forget that soil is brimming with life when most 
of its occupants are microscopic. Imagine the most crowded city 
street or subway you’ve ever tried to negotiate at rush hour. That’s 
a stroll in an empty wilderness compared to the multitudes of soil 
dwellers living beneath your feet. A single gram of soil — about 

 Chapter 1: Digging into Compost

the size of a navy bean — holds 100 million to 1 billion bacteria, 
100,000 to 1 million fungi, 1,000 to 1 million algae, and 1,000 
to 100,000 protozoa.
The soil’s microscopic multitudes share space with larger inver-
tebrates, many of whom you can see with the naked eye, such as 
springtails, mites, and beetles. Populations of microscopic organ-
isms and soil invertebrates create a diverse and highly function-
ing soil food web (see Chapter 3 for more details). And they’re 
the same fascinating creatures that convert your yard wastes and 
kitchen scraps to useful compost.
You Can Do It! Home Composting 
Made Easy
I delve into more detail about hot and cold composting methods 
in this section, but if you’re eager to get started, jump ahead to 
Chapter 4 to find basic instructions for creating a simple, free-
standing pile.
Some like it hot!
As microorganisms begin breaking down organic matter, they 
release heat as a byproduct of their activity. If you build a pile with 
the right mix of ingredients, moisture, and air, it quickly reaches 
120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) and higher and may 
heat up sufficiently to kill weed seeds or pathogens. This is known 
as hot or thermophilic composting. Specialized microorganisms 
known as thermophiles (heat-lovers) survive those high temps and 
continue eating and reproducing until the conditions are no longer 
favorable — that is, when your pile runs out of food, water, and air.
You can manage your composting to maintain relatively high 
temperatures by mixing and remoistening (as needed) until the 
preferred food sources are depleted. At that point, temperatures 
start dropping, and different microorganisms known as mesophiles 
(which thrive in moderate temperatures) take over. Soil inverte-
brates also arrive when temperatures drop to join in the decom-
position process. Hot composting produces useable compost in as 
little as 3 or 4 weeks up to 2 or 3 months.
Cool customers
In cold or slow composting systems, it may take 6 to 12 months 
or even longer to obtain useable compost. Piles don’t heat up 

Part I: Composting Basics  
10
sufficiently to kill weed seeds or pathogens. However, the advan-
tage is that the pile requires no maintenance on your part after 
you build it. Even though you aren’t turning the pile to improve 
aeration or adding moisture, decomposer organisms will continue 
to break down the refuse. Mesophile and psychrophiles (cold-loving 
organisms) perform the work at a slower pace.
Vermicomposting (worm composting) and most forms of sheet com-
posting (spreading organic material on top of the soil to decom-
pose in place) are considered cold systems. Because they vary 
from the traditional approach of working with a pile, these meth-
ods are covered in their own chapters.
Reaping the Rewards 
of Composting
Composting saves you money, reduces global warming, helps you 
lose weight, and improves your love life! All right, there might be 
some exaggeration in that statement, but given a choice between 
composting and product infomercials blaring similar claims, I’d go 
with composting because it
 
✓ Saves money by cutting trash collection fees and reducing, or 
eliminating, the need to buy soil amendments, conditioners, 
and fertilizers. You can also save on your water bill because 
incorporating compost into your soil improves its moisture-
holding capacity.
 
✓ Reduces the amount of methane (a greenhouse gas) produced 
when organic matter decomposes in landfills.
 
✓ Burns about 350 calories per hour as you turn the pile (for a 
person weighing 150 pounds).
 
✓ Might get you noticed by someone who cares about one of the 
previous three items.
Still not convinced? This section offers more good reasons to take 
up composting.
A healthier, more prolific garden
If you want to grow a fabulous vegetable, flower, or herb garden, 
start with your soil. Healthy, fertile soil equals healthy, productive 
plants. And the best thing you can do to create healthy garden soil 
is to add compost. Here’s what compost will do for your beds:

 Chapter 1: Digging into Compost 11
 
✓ Add organic matter to improve soil structure and porosity: 
Soil is made up of sand, silt, and clay particles. Soil structure 
refers to the arrangement of these particles — how they 
aggregate or clump together and form pore spaces that permit 
air and water flow through the soil. Soil porosity creates a 
healthy environment for plant roots to thrive. Incorporating 
compost helps sandy soil retain moisture and nutrients so 
you may be able to water and fertilize less frequently. Adding 
compost also loosens compacted clay soil, reduces erosion, 
and promotes better drainage so plant roots don’t rot in 
overly wet soil.
 
✓ Add and feed beneficial soil microorganisms: Compost is 
chock-full of beneficial microbes that add life to your garden 
soil. When you add compost to your soil, the microbes con-
tinue breaking down organic matter to release nutrients and 
even keep “bad” organisms in check.
 
✓ Provide slow-release nutrients: Because its nutrient content 
varies widely based on the original ingredients and decom-
position process, compost is considered a soil amendment, 
not a fertilizer. Even so, compost contains essential plant 
nutrients and trace elements to improve soil fertility. Also, 
compost releases its nutrients slowly while it decomposes fur-
ther in your soil. Garden plants make use of the nutrients over 
a longer growing season. Most chemical fertilizers release 
their nutrients in a quick burst; some of the value may be lost 
if plants aren’t ready to utilize it or heavy rains or excessive 
irrigation leach it away.
A healthier community and planet
The many virtues of composting reach beyond improving indi-
vidual gardens. Composting your yard waste and kitchen scraps at 
home, rather than setting them out for trash collection, offers you 
an avenue to be a part of the solution for issues such as overbur-
dened landfills, pollution, and global warming. Here are a few rea-
sons to divert your compostable organic materials from heading to 
the landfill:
 
✓ Composting extends the life of existing landfills and reduces 
the need to create others.
 
✓ Composting reduces transportation costs and related air pol-
lutants from trash collection and hauling.
 
✓ As organic waste decomposes in landfills, it generates acidic 
liquid (leachate) that may combine with other contaminants 
in the landfill and seep into groundwater supplies.

Part I: Composting Basics  
12
 
✓ Organic waste that is tightly compressed in landfills to decom-
pose without oxygen produces methane, which is a green-
house gas.
 
✓ Burning yard waste is not a suitable option for disposal in 
urban areas, because it pollutes the air and exacerbates prob-
lems for people with allergies, bronchitis, asthma, and other 
respiratory issues. Burning waste is also banned in some rural 
areas, so composting is a good alternative.
 
✓ A compost heap is a wonderful wildlife habitat that teems 
with invertebrates and makes a snug home for beneficial crea-
tures such as toads that provide free insect control in your 
garden.
 
Yard waste includes any type of organic residue from landscaping 
or gardening activities: pruned branches, spent plants, dead flow-
ers, grass clippings, twigs, leaves, and weeds. Many of our com-
monly accepted landscaping practices generate enormous piles 
of organic waste. For example, freshly mown grass clippings or 
autumn leaves are raked, stuffed into plastic bags, and piled high 
at curbside for trash pickup. According to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 12.8 percent of municipal solid waste generated 
in 2007 consisted of yard waste!
I won’t bury you beneath a mountain of statistics, but there’s good 
news to report. Yard waste is biodegradable and clean (as in non-
hazardous), making it perfectly suited for composting rather than 
transporting it to landfills. More people seem to be accepting that 
idea. In 2000, 56.9 percent of yard trimmings were “recovered” as 
compost in municipal programs. That’s a giant leap in ten years 
from 1990’s recovery rate of a paltry 12 percent.
Composting organic waste is also on the rise in Canada and the 
United Kingdom. In 2000, the average Canadian sent 32 kilograms 
of organic materials to centralized composting facilities. In 2004, 
the amount jumped to 51 kilograms. In the 10-year period from 
1997 through 2006, recycled green waste collected in England 
jumped from 347,455 metric tons to 2,212,600 metric tons.
Whether you compost at home or have access to community 
collection programs, transforming your organic waste into benefi-
cial compost is an earth-friendly path to take on behalf of future 
generations.

Soil characteristics of the American 
West and Southwest
If soil native to arid climates was a paint color, it could be marketed as “Boring 
Beige” or “Drab Dirt.” Most gardeners in the arid West and Southwest regions of 
the United States encounter significantly different soil characteristics than garden-
ing compatriots in other areas. Folks who relocate from regions where easily plung-
ing a spade into dark soil is the expected norm are often flabbergasted when they 
have to wield a pickaxe to chip a dent in hard, rocky, organic-matter-challenged 
soil at their new abode. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t good soil. It just has 
different characteristics.
That black earth in other regions forms because native plants drop large amounts 
of litter. All that organic matter continuously decomposes with the aid of plentiful 
precipitation, and over eons it builds layers of rich topsoil. In comparison, the des-
ert’s native plants drop insignificant organic matter. Consider the teensy leaf size of 
a mesquite tree versus a maple tree’s large leaf, or the barely noticeable plant litter 
at the base of a cactus versus the thick bed of needles surrounding a pine tree. 
Also, extreme aridity slows the rate of decomposition. Mother Nature just doesn’t 
have sufficient organic matter and moisture to work with! Consequently, arid-land 
soils may contain less than one-half of 1 percent organic matter.
Lack of organic matter contributes to a lack of nitrogen in desert soils. Although 
nitrogen is one of the primary elements required for plant growth, native trees and 
shrubs seldom suffer from nitrogen deficiency. They’ve either evolved to thrive 
without much nitrogen, as cacti do, or they make their own. Many arid-land plants 
are legumes, such as acacia and mesquite, which manufacture nitrogen in their 
root systems with the aid of soil bacteria.
Another common characteristic of arid-land soil is alkalinity, ranging from 8 to 8.5 
on the pH scale. (pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity. On the scale of 0–14, 7 is 
neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline.) Soil’s pH level affects a plant’s 
ability to absorb nutrients.
Native and desert-adapted plants readily absorb what they need from existing soils. 
The challenge occurs if you try to grow plants native to different climates and soils, 
which includes many favorite annual vegetables and flowers. Annuals, by defini-
tion, complete their life cycle in one relatively-short growing season. To fuel this 
furious growth spurt, you must enrich your arid-land garden beds with compost.

Composting with kids
The National Gardening Association (NGA) offers a wealth of resources to par-
ents and educators to help them engage children in gardening activities, includ-
ing composting and vermicomposting. At NGA’s Kids Gardening Web site (www.
kidsgardening.org), you can find project ideas, suggestions to tie compost-
ing activities to curriculum requirements, grant sources for financial and material 
assistance, and real-life experiences.
One inspirational story comes from a Simi Valley, California, teacher. Over a period 
of several years, her sixth-grade classes progressed from observing a handful of 
red wiggler worms process food scraps in plastic soda bottles to designing a vermi-
composting system that could handle their cafeteria waste to ultimately starting a 
worm-based business. Vermicomposting activities in the classroom gave students 
a hands-on laboratory of scientific exploration that offered opportunities to teach 
skills in all basic subjects.
But garden-based learning offers benefits beyond the 3 Rs. In a survey conducted 
by NGA, garden program leaders reported remarkable improvement in essential life 
skills that are not easily taught to youngsters. They noted participant improvements 
in the following characteristics: environmental attitudes, 96 percent; community 
spirit, 92 percent; self-confidence, 89 percent; social skills, 87 percent; leadership 
skills, 85 percent; attitude towards school, 82 percent; volunteerism, 81 percent; 
nutritional attitudes, 77 percent; motor skills, 65 percent; and scholastic achieve-
ment, 63 percent.
You don’t have to be an experienced teacher to share the world of composting and 
gardening with a new generation. Often it’s the simple things that spark enthusiasm 
and set kids off on a path of natural discovery. For example, a friend of mine took 
her compost crank (see Chapter 2) when giving an outdoor demonstration to kids. 
They were thrilled with the opportunity to stir the compost, and she reported they 
didn’t want to give it up when she was ready to leave!

▶ Safeguarding your well-being while composting
▶ Choosing useful, good-quality tools
▶ Keeping your tools in top-notch shape
I
f you’re already gardening, chances are you can dive right into 
composting with tools you have on hand. But if you’re new to 
both gardening and composting, you’ll be happy to hear that you 
don’t need to break your bank to create a tool arsenal.
This chapter shows that the supervision of rotting organic matter 
requires only a few basic tools! Many tools have names that are 
used interchangeably or differ regionally, so I help you sort that 
out. You also get recommendations on features to look for when 
purchasing quality tools, as well as steps to take to keep them in 
good condition. And because safety should always be your number 
one concern, the chapter starts off with a few basics on staying 
safe and healthy in the garden.
Protecting Yourself from the 
Elements: Safety Gear
Composting is fun! You can keep it that way with a few simple pre-
cautions: Wear gloves and other safety gear as needed, and protect 
yourself from the sun.
Getting a good pair of gloves
Some women have lots of shoes in the closet. I have lots of garden 
gloves on the shelf. I seldom pass a display of gardening gloves 
without stopping to try them on. Good-fitting, comfortable gloves 
are essential for your gardening and composting work. If they don’t 
“feel right” in the midst of your task, you’re likely to pull them off, 

Part I: Composting Basics  
16
toss them aside (forgetting where you left them), and have no pro-
tection from scratches, scrapes, and blisters. Sure, you can pick up 
an inexpensive pair of cotton gloves at the hardware store or nurs-
ery to get started, but upgrading to better-quality gloves when you 
find a pair that suits you is worthwhile. Manufacturers have been 
combining useful design features with diverse materials to create a 
whole new batch of glove styles that protect hands while still pro-
viding much-needed comfort and flexibility. Here’s a rundown of 
your options and my recommendations:
 
✓ Glove materials
 
• Goatskin containing natural lanolin creates soft, supple 
leather that fits like, well, like a glove.
 
• Leather treated during the tanning process to be water-
repellent and hand-washable ensures that the gloves 
don’t turn into adobe brick as some leather gloves do 
if they get wet in the garden. Leather gloves also offer 
some protection against thorns.
 
• Four-way stretch nylon (the same fabric used for a lot of 
athletic gear) fits smoothly across the back of the hand.
 
✓ Glove features
 
• Padded palms offer comfort and gripping power when 
performing repetitive turning and digging chores.
 
• Longer wrists with a stretchy loop-and-tape closure lock 
out dirt and make taking the gloves off and pulling them 
back on quick and easy.
 
• Longer length gloves (sometimes referred to as gaunt-
lets) cover all or part of the forearm (most gloves finish 
at the wrist). This type is especially useful when dealing 
with lots of thorny prunings.
 
• Reinforced fingertips add protection and longevity.
 
• Waterproof liners keep water out and warmth in.
Shielding your eyes
If you chop compost ingredients — either with a hand tool or chip-
per/shredder machine — always wear safety glasses or goggles to 
protect your eyes from errant UFOs (unidentified flying organics). 
Make sure you also wear these glasses when dealing with piles 
of long, thin, or thorny stems that could easily whip back and hit 
you in the eye. Safety glasses also come in handy when you turn 
dry organic matter that churns a lot of dust particles into the air. 
If allergies are a problem, safety glasses (along with a dust mask) 

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade 17
may help prevent red, runny eyes or other symptoms. You can 
pick up an inexpensive pair of safety glasses at a hardware or 
home improvement store.
Donning a dust mask
Depending on the ingredients in your compost pile and where you 
garden, turning organic matter may stir up dust particles, pollen, 
or mold spores that can be easily inhaled. Shredding leaves and 
chopping organic matter also creates fine bits of drifting material. 
If you have allergies, asthma, or other respiratory issues, don a 
dust mask to protect yourself during these composting activities. 
You can purchase inexpensive paper dust masks from hardware 
and paint stores or search online for many higher-quality options.
 
If you have allergies or respiratory issues, the following ideas may 
help you enjoy your gardening activities with fewer airborne 
problems:
 
✓ Sprinkle the compost pile with water as you work, to hold 
down dust and debris.
 
✓ Refrain from turning piles on windy days.
 
✓ Work outdoors after rain showers, because rain and humidity 
dampen the flight of windborne pollen.
 
✓ Limit gardening activities in the early morning (5 to 10 a.m.), 
when most pollen is released.
 
✓ Shower and change your clothes immediately after working in 
the garden.
Blocking harmful rays with 
a hat and sunscreen
If you’re a northern-climate gardener, you may be scratching your 
head (or rolling your eyes) about my next suggestion. But the sun’s 
ultraviolet rays are damaging no matter where you live, and skin 
cancer rates are up around the globe. Protect yourself by
 
✓ Wearing a wide-brimmed hat
 
✓ Slathering on sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15
 
✓ Staying out of the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when the rays 
are most damaging
 
✓ Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants

Even if you think you’re just going out to the compost pile “for a 
minute,” it’s easy to become engrossed (compost is fascinating 
stuff), and two hours can sweep by before you know it. Please pro-
tect yourself, and stay hydrated with lots of drinking water!
Choosing the Right Tools and 
Equipment for the Job
All you really need to get composting is a long-handled fork, a spade 
or shovel, and something with which to chop up larger stems and 
prunings. But like most jobs in the garden, having the right tools 
for the task makes it a whole lot easier. This section guides you to 
select tools that are best for your composting efforts. Tool descrip-
tions may also mention other common gardening tasks that they’re 
designed for because if you’re shopping for tools, this information 
may help you decide which styles offer the most bang for your buck.
Mixing things up with a pitchfork 
or compost fork
You only need one fork to get started composting, and because the 
features of various forks are so similar, I describe them together. 
Pitchforks and compost forks have four or five long, thin, tapered, 
and upward-curving tines designed to efficiently glide into a pile 
of organic material, allowing you to hoist and pitch it to a new 
location. These forks are perfect for moving large clumps of bulky, 
lightweight organic matter, such as hay, straw, leaves, and plant 
trimmings. Use them to build new compost piles and turn them 
until the organic matter is fairly decomposed. Then it’s time to 
switch to a shovel or soil fork for turning almost-finished compost 
one last time, or moving finished compost into the garden.
The primary differences between a pitchfork and a compost fork 
are the handle length and shape. Pitchfork handles are usually 
about 4 feet (1.2 meters) long with a straight end. Compost fork 
handles are usually shorter — about 3 feet (1 meter) long — with 
a D-grip end. Also, pitchforks generally have narrower tool heads 
than compost forks.
Digging in with a soil fork
Also known as a digging fork or spading fork, this tool’s flattened 
prongs are shorter, thicker, and sturdier than pitchfork or compost 

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade 19
fork tines. A soil fork is useful for turning almost-finished compost 
or digging heavy finished compost from the pile and incorporating 
it into garden beds. Soil forks also are terrific tools for plunging 
into compacted soil to loosen it when creating a new planting area. 
They can be used to break up clods and clumps of soil and dig up 
weedy patches, making it easy to pull handfuls of weeds and shake 
the soil off their roots. The shorter tines of soil forks don’t work 
as well as pitchforks and compost forks for moving loads of unde-
composed organic matter, but they do a decent job of scooping up 
small piles of annuals or weeds pulled from the garden.
Getting the lowdown on 
shovels and spades
The words “shovel” and “spade” are sometimes used interchange-
ably, and the terminology may vary by region as well. Generally, 
though, a shovel is a tool designed for moving material, with a 
raised lip on each side of the blade to stop bits from falling off. A 
spade has a sharp, straight head and is used for digging. As previ-
ously described with forks, a spade can be used for shifting mate-
rial both before and after composting, although not so efficiently.
Both shovels and spades are available in various styles, with slight 
variations to enhance specific gardening tasks, such as trenching for 
irrigation lines, edging lawns, or transplanting perennials. Table 2-1 
notes a few characteristics to help you sort them out.
Table 2-1 
Characteristics of Shovels versus Spades
Shovels
Spades
Have long handles — about 
48 inches (1.2 meters)
Have shorter handles — about 28 inches 
(70 centimeters)
Have straight handles
Have D-grip handles
Have an angled neck for 
scooping and tossing soil
Have a straight neck for digging into soil
Rounded-blade shovel
A rounded-blade shovel serves as an all-purpose tool for gardening 
tasks such as turning almost-finished compost, shoveling finished 
compost from a bin, incorporating compost into garden beds, and 
digging transplant holes in already-loose, sandy, or loamy soils.

Part I: Composting Basics  
20
Pointed-blade shovel
 
A pointed-blade shovel is the most versatile choice if you buy 
only one digging implement. It performs the same chores as the 
rounded-blade shovel, while also allowing easier digging into 
compacted clay soils. The pointed blade is useful for chopping up 
organic matter into smaller pieces before tossing it into the com-
post pile, although the square-blade spade, which I describe next, 
does a better job with this task. A pointed-blade shovel is also 
helpful for slicing through root balls when dividing perennials.
Square-blade digging spade
Typically used for loosening and digging soil in garden beds, the 
square-blade spade’s shorter handle length and flat blade edge 
also facilitate chopping up organic matter into bits and pieces for 
speedier decomposition. (See other chopping options later in this 
chapter.) The handle grips on these short, square-blade spades 
are either smooth and straight, as they are on the rounded- and 
pointed-blade shovels, or they have a D-grip, which gives you extra 
gripping power as you wield the tool as a chopper.
 
Buy a spade with a boot tread, which is a thicker top edge that 
allows your foot to push against the blade with more power. This 
characteristic is especially helpful if you garden where soils are 
hard, rocky, or compacted.
Investing in a good-quality hose
In composting, easy access to water is important because moisture 
is an essential component of a successful composting effort, and 
it’s likely that you’ll need to moisten the organic matter periodically 
to keep it decomposing properly. A cheap hose will plague you for-
ever, kinking, cracking, and refusing to coil easily until you finally 
give up and buy a better one. Splurge on a good-quality hose at the 
outset and add a nozzle that allows you to turn the flow on and off 
to conserve water while you work, as well as adjust the settings for 
different watering chores in the garden. For composting, a fine spray 
works great to gently moisten everything without wasting water as 
you work. Nozzles are available in a wide range of styles and prices.
You can buy hoses with or without reels, but for your main hose 
a reel is strongly recommended. It enables you to coil and store 
your hose quickly, easily, and neatly, and it also extends the life of 
the hose. Choose from free-standing or wall-mounted reels; some 
retract automatically while others have to be wound manually.
 
You can extend the life of your hose by following these simple 
guidelines:

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade 21
 
✓ Don’t leave a hose lying in direct sun.
 
✓ Drain a hose before winter weather sets in, and store it 
indoors during the off-season.
 
✓ Don’t drag a hose over rocky surfaces.
 
✓ Coil a hose when not in use.
 
Water pressure decreases as the hose gets longer, so purchase a 
hose that is only as long as you need.
Moving compost in buckets or tarps
Compost transport around the garden can be as thrifty and low-
tech as a heavy-duty plastic builder’s bucket (not a lightweight 
household one) or a tarp. A bucket is ideal for moving small quan-
tities of compost. As for bigger loads, of course it will take time 
and labor to transfer lots of compost with just a bucket or two, but 
think of all the wonderful free exercise you’ll get.
Check out a garden supply store for sturdy tarps or carry bags 
with reinforced corner handles that allow you to gather up the 
corners and drag the bundle by yourself or carry it between two 
people. Another option is a contractor-grade polyethylene tarp 
with reinforced grommets in the corners. They may come with 
their own handles or you can slip nylon rope or lengths of cloth 
through the grommets to make your own. Polyethylene tarps are 
waterproof and tear-resistant.
 
Tarps are also great for tossing over compost piles to maintain 
moisture in arid climates and prevent excess moisture from turn-
ing your compost into a soggy mess in rainy climates. Also, cover-
ing a newly constructed pile with a tarp helps retain heat as the 
decomposition process gets underway. Polyethylene works best as 
a cover, but burlap is better than nothing!
Hauling compost with wheelbarrows 
or garden carts
If you generate a lot of compost and have a big yard with lots of 
plants and planting areas to haul your lovely compost to, a wheel-
barrow or garden cart is an asset. They come in all sorts of varia-
tions, sizes, and weights.
Most wheelbarrows have one tire, positioned in front, and you 
lift the back end up off the ground to push it along. (Although 
two-wheeler wheelbarrows are also available, they’re typically 

Part I: Composting Basics  
22
construction-grade to support heavy loads. You still have to lift 
and push.) Wheelbarrows are less stable than garden carts, but 
more maneuverable in tight spaces. Depending on their weight and 
that of the materials within, dumping everything out by tipping the 
wheelbarrow up on end is fairly easy.
When you’ve seen one wheelbarrow, you’ve pretty much seen 
them all, but garden carts offer a diverse range of styles. Carts dis-
tribute the weight of the load over two and sometimes four wheels, 
making them steadier to control than wheelbarrows. Carts can be 
pushed or pulled, and some can be towed by lawn tractors or even 
bicycles if you’re so inclined. Their typically rectangular or boxy 
shape doesn’t allow quite the same maneuverability for backing up 
and spinning around in tight quarters as wheelbarrows do. Some 
garden carts look like crossbreeds with wheelbarrows, but have 
deeper beds and wider wheel platforms for stability. Some carts 
can be lifted and dumped like wheelbarrows; others have panels 
that flip up or can be removed completely for ease in loading and 
unloading. Other styles fold up for storage during the off-season.
The following questions can help you sort out the best choice for 
your needs when purchasing either a wheelbarrow or garden cart:
 
✓ How much weight and volume does it hold?
 
✓ How much weight can you comfortably push or pull?
 
✓ Will its dimensions travel easily through areas in your yard, 
such as between garden rows or into the tight corner where 
the compost bins are?
 
✓ How sturdy are the wheels? Will they support a heavy load 
without collapsing? Look for wide tires with tread if you need 
traction on slopes.
 
✓ What is the construction material? Will it hold up in your 
climate?
 
✓ Are the handles comfortable to grip?
 
✓ Are metal parts rust-resistant?
Additional Gadgets and Tools for 
the Enthusiastic Composter
Compost will make itself without the aid of any gadgets, but if you 
want to speed things up a bit or just get up close and personal with 
your heap, check out the additional tools and gadgets covered in 
this section.

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade 23
Testing your compost’s temperature
I’m not much for gadgets, but I do love my compost thermom-
eter. Mounted on the end of a long probe (about 20 inches, or 0.5 
meter), this thermometer is ideal for sticking into the center of a 
pile to monitor its temperature. (Read all about it in Chapter 8.)
Aerating your compost
The best method for incorporating more air into your compost is 
to turn the pile completely, as I describe in Chapter 8. But if you 
don’t have the time or inclination to turn it, an aerating tool may be 
useful. An aerating crank, also known as a compost crank, works on 
the principle that it’s easier to plunge a long implement deep within 
the organic matter to poke around — especially within the confines 
of a small and narrow bin — than it is to stir things up from above 
with a pitchfork or shovel. Cranks operate like giant corkscrews (see 
Figure 2-1). You stick the tool on top of the compost, turn the handle 
to drill it through the organic matter, and then pull it out or unscrew 
it by turning the handle in the reverse direction.
 
While shopping for composting equipment, you may encounter an 
aerating tool somewhat resembling a harpoon. Paddles lie flush with 
the tool as you plunge it through the organic matter. As you pull the 
tool back out, the paddles pop out to the sides to catch and move 
organic matter. The harpoon aerators I’ve tried require more physical 
effort than a compost crank, and the paddles have repeatedly gotten 
stuck in chunky or woody material, making the tool troublesome to 
pull out. If you’re a big burly weightlifter, yanking out a stuck aerating 
tool may be of no consequence! But if you’re puny (like me) or have 
back or shoulder problems, the harpoon style may not suit you.
 
Bear in mind that, depending on where you live, your heap is very 
likely to become home to all sorts of creatures, from frogs and 
toads to hedgehogs, particularly in winter. Stirring up your heap 
could disturb or even kill them.
Considering chopping tools
You don’t need chopping tools to be an effective composter. As I 
describe earlier in the chapter, pointed- and square-blade shovels 
can chop weeds and plant material. As you trim plants, you can use 
pruners and loppers for reducing organic matter into smaller pieces. 
However, if you have lots of organic matter to dice and slice, other 
tool options include a machete or a cutter mattock (see Figure 2-1).

Part I: Composting Basics  
24
 
Machetes and cutter mattocks are sharp tools that can cause seri-
ous injury, so caution is required.
 
✓ Machete: You’ve likely seen an actor in a movie whacking 
through dense jungle foliage with a machete. This long-bladed 
knife works fine for chopping up garden refuse. Sizes vary, 
but a machete blade is usually about 15 to 20 inches (38 to 51 
centimeters), plus a 5- to 6-inch (12- to 15-centimeter) handle. 
You need a flat, stable chopping surface to lay the material 
on for chopping. I know a gardener who chops on an old tree 
stump. Rather than paying someone to grind the stump out, 
she’ll have chipped away most of it herself in a few years.
 
✓ Cutter mattock: A cutter mattock has a cutting edge blade 
similar to a small axe, which works well for chopping organic 
matter. Its second blade is usually an adz blade, used for dig-
ging in hard soil or hoeing. Mattock tool heads weigh from 3 
to 7 pounds (1.5 to 3 kilograms) and handles are about 3 to 4 
feet (1 to 1.2 meters) long.

Tool-Buying Tips
A specialized tool seems to be available for just about every 
garden task. If your current urge is to simplify rather than line the 
garage wall with more gadgets, carefully consider what types of 
gardening tasks you perform on a regular basis. Then purchase 
good-quality tools to help those chores go smoothly. The follow-
ing sections address questions to ask yourself when evaluating a 
particular tool.
How does it feel?
A tool works best when it’s comfortable for you to use, and only 
you can make that determination. Head to the store, remove the 
tool from its hook or bin, and heft it. Do the weight and balance 
feel right? Is the length appropriate? Because many gardening 
chores are repetitive, using tools that are too heavy or awkward in 
any way causes muscle strain, so if a tool doesn’t feel right, don’t 
buy it. There’s amazing diversity in the tool market these days, so 
take the time to select a good-quality tool that feels good to you.
How’s it made?
For strength and long-lasting durability, select tools that have 
the blade (the tool head) and the collar (the means by which the 
blade attaches to the handle) forged in one piece of metal. Forged 
tools are heavier and stronger than tools that are stamped (basi-
cally cut and bent) from a sheet of metal. Although less expensive, 
stamped tools are weaker and less durable. Examine how the tool 
head is attached to the handle. Better-quality tools have handles 
with either solid-strap or solid-socket attachments, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. A solid-strap handle has a metal tongue extending from 
the blade into the handle and secured with a rivet. A solid-socket 
handle inserts into a closed metal tube.
High-carbon forged steel is strong and allows you to maintain 
a sharp blade over time. Stainless steel tools are also good and 
offer the added benefit of rust resistance. However, it’s somewhat 
more difficult to keep a sharp edge on stainless steel than on 
carbon. Aluminum typically is not sturdy enough for the long haul, 
although recent innovations such as aluminum and magnesium 
alloy offer durability with less overall weight.

Part I: Composting Basics  
26

b
Figure 2-2: Solid-strap (a) and solid-socket (b) handles.
Materials-wise, most handle choices are either hardwood or 
fiberglass. Ash and hickory are the strongest hardwoods for tool 
handles. However, fiberglass handles are stronger and last longer. 
If you’re lax about maintaining tools or returning them to the tool 
shed at the end of the day, fiberglass may be a better investment in 
the long run. Compare the differences:
 
✓ Hardwood tool handles
 
• Are less expensive than fiberglass
 
• Absorb the shock of repetitive motions (such as dig, lift, 
toss, dig, lift, toss) to reduce muscle fatigue
 
• Require seasonal maintenance to prevent cracking
 
• Can be cut to size for a more comfortable fit
 
✓ Fiberglass tool handles
 
• Are more expensive than hardwood
 
• Are lightweight, but don’t absorb the shock of repetitive 
movements
 
• Are maintenance-free
 
• Sport bright-colored handles that are easy to spot in the 
garden
Showing Your Tools Some TLC
The simple step of cleaning tools after each use helps keep them free 
of rust and in good condition to work for you — rather than against 
you — for years to come. (There’s something gratifying about passing 
Grandma’s or Grandpa’s tools on to the next generation.)

 Chapter 2: Tools of the Trade 27
Giving everything a quick cleaning
 
Set up a simple cleaning bucket where you store your tools. With 
everything close at hand, tidying your tools takes just a minute or 
two. All you need are rags for wiping off dirt and applying lubri-
cant, a stiff brush for scraping off caked mud, and a rust-inhibiting 
tool lubricant to occasionally wipe on metal parts with a rag after 
cleaning the tool.
Maintaining wooden handles
Wood will crack, split, or develop splinters if moisture works its 
way in. Wipe handles dry after use and store your tools out of 
harm’s way from sun, wind, rain, and snow. At the end of your 
gardening season, spruce up the handle. Use a fine-grit sandpaper 
to remove splinters. Seal the wood against moisture by wiping it 
down with a rag dipped in boiled linseed oil, which is available at 
hardware and home-and-garden stores. Apply multiple coats over 
a few days to allow the oil to penetrate. This practice can also 
somewhat rejuvenate an old handle and keep the tool working 
longer (an especially helpful hint if you find a bargain at a yard or 
rummage sale).

Chapter 3
The Decomposition Process
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how organic materials rot
▶ Identifying compost critters
▶ Creating hospitable conditions to obtain fast compost
Your compost pile is a food web, containing groups of ever-
larger inhabitants consuming plant material and each other. 
Together, they take your kitchen scraps and manure and other 
stuff and transform it into wonderfully rich growing material. In 
this chapter, I explain (in not-too-scientific terms) the two major 
processes — chemical and physical — that break big chunks of 
raw organic matter into smaller and smaller components that are 
ultimately used to fuel more cycles of life.
You also get descriptions of the major decomposer organisms in 
your compost pile. I understand that reading about “bugs” isn’t 
everyone’s favorite cup of tea, but I’m willing to bet that you’ll get 
hooked on composting critters sooner or later.
In the meantime, you don’t have to understand who is doing what 
to manage a successful compost system in your backyard. You 
only have to understand how to keep the decomposers function-
ing. The last main section of this chapter offers recommendations 
on managing food, water, air, and temperature to keep your com-
posting actors performing at peak capacity.
Decomp 101: How Rotting Works
Composting critters employ one of two basic methods of decompo-
sition to break down all that debris in your compost pile — chemical 
or physical. The processes of chemical and physical decomposition 
are described in the following sections. I also explain how all these 
composters interact in your compost community.

Part I: Composting Basics  
30
Going to pieces: The 
physical breakup
Soil invertebrates (creatures lacking backbones) are an amazingly 
diverse community charged with the endless task of physically 
reducing mountains of organic refuse to smaller and smaller bits. 
Depending on species, they attack their work with mouthparts 
designed for chewing, biting, rasping, shredding, or grinding plant 
matter.
These varied chomping efforts reduce larger pieces of organic matter 
into smaller ones with more surface area, which in turn enables bacte-
ria and the other chemical decomposers (which I describe in the next 
section) to gain a foothold and work more effectively.
Physical decomposers act in the early stages of your compost pile, 
but as bacterial activity heats up and the temperatures rise, they 
depart (or die). When temperatures drop back down, you’ll notice 
all sorts of life and movement as physical decomposers return to 
the pile to continue their work.
Freeing the nutrients: The 
chemical breakdown
During your compost pile’s process of chemical decomposition, 
microbes such as bacteria and fungi release enzymes that break 
down complex organic compounds into simpler compounds, which 
these decomposers can then absorb into their bodies as nutrients. 
Other organisms obtain nutrients by eating the microbes. And as 
microbes die, the compounds tied up in their bodies are released 
and become available for another generation of organisms to use.
No matter how efficiently they work, microbes and other decom-
posers ultimately reach a point where some substances can’t be 
broken down any further. These byproducts of decomposition 
become linked together to form humus, that most desirable, crum-
bly, dark brown end result of composting. (Jump back to Chapter 1 
to find out more about valuable humus.)
Maintaining balance through 
the food web
The relationships between members of your compost pile commu-
nity aren’t always friendly, but the organisms — in all their eating 
and being eaten — contribute to giving you great compost.

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 31
A food chain depicts what each living organism eats to obtain energy 
and nutrients, and then, who eats it. The first link is a plant that 
is consumed by the second link in the chain, perhaps a grasshop-
per, who is in turn eaten by a quail, and so on. A food web depicts 
a wider community of organisms participating in many interrelated 
food chains. Your compost pile functions as a hyperactive food web, 
supporting varied life forms and billions of individuals in their ongo-
ing enterprise of breaking down and recycling organic matter. These 
diverse organisms create a highly functioning food web by
 
✓ Eating, digesting, and excreting nutrients in forms that other 
organisms can absorb
 
✓ Regulating populations of organisms so no particular group 
burgeons out of control
 
✓ Becoming food themselves for higher-level consumers in the 
food web
Your compost pile’s food web always begins with organic residue — 
leaves, grass clippings, manure, coffee grounds, kitchen scraps, 
and so on. All that “garbage” you pile up gives life to primary 
decomposers, who are the first to sit down at the table. They 
include both physical decomposers and chemical decomposers.
Next up are secondary consumers, organisms that eat primary 
consumers. Some of these you can spy with the naked eye, such as 
beetles and springtails. Others are microscopic, including proto-
zoa that eat bacteria.
Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. These are the larger 
(relatively speaking) occupants of your compost pile, such as cen-
tipedes and beetles that you can easily see scurrying away when 
you flip over a mound of organic matter with your fork or shovel.
Table 3-1 groups typical organisms working in your compost pile 
into levels of primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers.

Who’s Doing the Hard Work?
I used to take a break from tossing yet another load of organic 
matter from one bin into another to lean on my pitchfork, wipe my 
sweaty brow, survey my accomplishments, and think (somewhat 
virtuously) that I was “composting.” I then had the good fortune to 
take a Master Composter course and found out that I couldn’t lay 
claim to that effort.
Although I was providing the right conditions for them, it was actu-
ally billions and billions (and more billions) of decomposer organ-
isms that were “composting” on my behalf. I don’t mind playing 
second fiddle to this fascinating cast of characters. They play their 
roles to perfection if I nudge them along just a little, and continue 
to perform even if I ignore their needs completely.
In the following sections, you get a quick introduction to the crit-
ters at work in your compost pile. I discuss the chemical decom-
posers first — because they do most of the work — and then 
introduce the physical decomposers. (For more on the difference 
between physical and chemical decomposition, see the earlier sec-
tion “Decomp 101: How Rotting Works.”) I also toss in some “Fun 
facts” along the way: Knowing these bits of trivia won’t make you 
any more successful at composting, but they may give you the 
edge you need to make it big on Jeopardy! if you should so aspire.
Counting on chemical decomposers
The specific microbes involved in chemical decomposition — 
bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and protozoa — are the subject of 
the next sections. I describe them in general order of their popula-
tion numbers in a typical composting effort.
Bacteria turn up the heat
Bacteria are single-celled organisms. They’re the most numerous 
chemical decomposers, comprising 80 to 90 percent of the microbes 
working in your pile. They hitch a ride to the compost party on your 
original ingredients, so the types and numbers of bacteria vary with 
each pile you construct. The more variety in your ingredients, the 
more variety in your decomposers, and ultimately, your finished 
compost will have more nutrients and beneficial characteristics.
Different bacteria thrive at different temperature ranges. When 
temperatures rise or drop, ruling populations die or become inac-
tive and other species take over to control the action. As bacterial 
populations thrive — eating, reproducing, and dying — they give 
off heat as a by-product. You can read more about managing the 

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 33
heat to maximize your composting efforts later in this chapter in 
the section “Tuning the temperature.”
Fun fact: One generation of bacteria in your compost pile lives 
only 20 to 30 minutes. Kinda gives new meaning to the saying, “So 
much to do, so little time!”
More bacteria: Actinomycetes get into the act
As earlier bacteria populations consume all the easy-to-break-down 
compounds, such as simple sugars, actinomycetes (ak-tin-oh-mahy-
seet-eez) take over to work on complex organic materials such as 
bark and fibrous or woody stems.
Actinomycetes are single-celled bacteria, although they form long, 
branching threads or filaments that look more like fungal struc-
tures than bacteria. Unlike other types of bacteria in your com-
post, you can see patches of actinomycetes with the naked eye 
because they form grayish strands that resemble cobwebs spread-
ing through the outer 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of a pile.
Fun fact: Your compost’s pleasing earthy aroma is produced by 
actinomycetes releasing gases during the decomposition process.
Fungi fine-tune the process
Like actinomycetes, fungi in your compost pile break down tough 
organic matter that earlier rounds of decomposers leave behind, 
such as dry, acidic, or high-carbon materials. Most fungi require 
less nitrogen than bacteria do, so fungi are important decomposers 
in piles with high-carbon materials, such as wood chips or sawdust 
(see “Rationing the carbons and nitrogens” later in this chapter).
Many different fungi types exist in your pile, including microscopic 
species as well as noticeable, fuzzy, whitish colonies. If you have rot-
ting wood in your pile, you may even see mushrooms sprouting, just 
as mushrooms cover fallen tree trunks decomposing on a forest floor!
Fun fact: The yeast that’s used to bake bread is actually a type of 
fungi!
Protozoa play along (sort of)
Like bacteria, protozoa are microscopic, one-celled organisms that 
appear as primary and secondary consumers in your compost. 
Protozoan populations are far less significant in number — and 
therefore effectiveness — in your compost pile than the previously 
described chemical decomposers.
Fun fact: Protozoa are clear and become the same color as what 
they’ve just eaten.

Part I: Composting Basics  
34
Profiting from physical decomposers
Many of the physical decomposers, such as beetles and millipedes, 
are large enough to easily spot from above. Others, such as mites and 
springtails, are tiny, although still visible with the naked eye if you 
scoop up a handful of compost and peer closely. Surprisingly per-
haps, the largest population of physical decomposers — nematodes, 
or roundworms — are almost all microscopic so you probably 
won’t see them at work. (However, if you get lucky and notice 
something that resembles a moving strand of human hair, you’re 
likely observing a nematode.)
I’m going to go out on a limb and declare that if you’re reading 
this book, you’re not a soil invertebrate like these other physical 
decomposers. But if you chop or break organic matter into smaller 
pieces before mixing it in your pile, you can add yourself to the list 
of physical decomposers I describe next.
Nematodes (roundworms)
In your compost pile, nematodes, also called roundworms, are 
worthy allies in your effort to recycle organic matter and nutrients. 
They consume decaying plant material and eat other decompos-
ers, such as bacteria and fungi.
Tens of thousands of nematode species exist worldwide in every 
type of environment; there are so many that scientists haven’t 
come close to identifying them all. Depending on species, nema-
todes are specialized eaters, consuming organic matter, bacteria, 
fungi, protozoa, and even their destructive (from a human per-
spective) nematode cousins. (See the earlier section “Counting on 
chemical decomposers” for more on bacteria and other microbes.)
Fun fact: Nematodes can move through soil only when a film 
of moisture surrounds soil particles. During dry conditions or 
drought, nematodes go dormant, reviving when soil moisture is 
available.
Mites
Mites belong to the class of critters known as arachnids, identified 
in part by four pairs of legs and no antennae. Like nematodes, the 
planet is covered with abundant mite species with varying work 
agendas. Although some mites are notable garden pests (spider 
mites), many beneficial mites help degrade organic matter in your 
compost pile. For example, mold mites (also called fermentation 
mites) feed primarily on yeasts in organic debris. Predatory mites 
in compost eat varied insects and insect eggs.
Fun fact: Most mold mites have transparent bodies.

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 35
Springtails
These intriguing little wingless insects measure from 1⁄16 inch (1.6 
millimeters) up to 1⁄4 inch (6.3 millimeters) in length. They have a 
hinged, tail-like appendage that bends forward beneath the abdo-
men and is held in place against the tummy by a “latch.” As the 
latch is released, the appendage “springs” down and launches the 
insect into the air like a pogo stick. (It’s true. I’m not sufficiently 
imaginative to make that up.)
Because of their jumping motion, springtails are sometimes mis-
taken for fleas, but they have none of those pests’ problem char-
acteristics such as biting or spreading disease. Occasionally, some 
springtail species may chew on leaves or roots of tender seedlings, 
although damage is usually insignificant. Established plants are not 
in any danger from springtails.
Consider any springtails you notice as yet more beneficial occu-
pants of your compost pile, chewing on decomposing plant matter, 
grains, bacteria, fungi, algae, pollen, and even insect feces. Because 
moisture and air pass readily through their body surfaces, spring-
tails are highly susceptible to drying out. Thus, you’ll most likely 
spy them in the moister environs of your compost pile.
Fun fact: Springtails “spring” 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 centimeters) 
in one jump.
Sowbugs and pillbugs
Very similar in appearance, these terrestrial crustaceans breathe 
with gills, so they require living accommodations that offer mois-
ture and high humidity. You’ll likely uncover sowbugs or pillbugs 
(sometimes called woodlice) in moist areas towards the center 
or bottom of the compost pile where they feed on decaying plant 
matter. Although they’re not troublesome enough to be labeled as 
pests, sowbugs and pillbugs may feed on tender living plant tissue, 
such as young seedlings growing in moist, organically rich soil.
Adults grow up to 3⁄8-inch (9.5-millimeters) long and have distinct, 
round body segments and seven pairs of legs. Sowbugs have “tail-
like” appendages; pillbugs don’t. Without these tails to get in the 
way, pillbugs roll into tight balls if they feel threatened, which 
explains another common name enjoyed by kids: “roly-poly.”
Fun fact: Sowbugs and pillbugs are related to crayfish, lobster, 
and shrimp.
Millipedes and centipedes
At first glance, millipedes and centipedes appear similar because 
they have numerous body segments and legs, but there are many 

Part I: Composting Basics  
36
distinctions. Millipedes feed on moist decaying plant matter, help-
ing break down the contents of your compost pile. However, cen-
tipedes feed only on living creatures, especially insects and insect 
larvae. They kill their prey by grasping them and injecting venom. 
Centipedes may use your compost pile as a hunting ground.
 
It’s generally better to leave millipedes or centipedes untouched 
in your compost pile, but if you choose to pick them up, wear pro-
tective gloves and safety glasses. Centipede bites can be painful, 
although they’re not usually life threatening unless the victim has 
allergic reactions or is a small child. In such cases, consult your 
physician or poison control center immediately. Millipedes may 
eject an irritating fluid that leaves a foul odor, causes skin reac-
tions, and may be harmful if it gets into your eyes. Some species 
can launch this substance several inches!
Fun fact: Despite their names, millipedes don’t sport a thousand 
legs nor do centipedes stroll about on 100. A more likely leg count 
is less than 100 for millipedes and about 30 for centipedes.
Beetles
Beetles are hard-shelled insects with two sets of wings folded 
against their back. Numerous beetle species operate throughout 
your compost pile, both during their larval life stage (when they’re 
called grubs) and as adult beetles. Grubs feed on rotting organic 
matter. Beetles may consume organic matter but also seek prey 
such as fly larvae (maggots), mites, and nematodes.
Fun fact: Various beetle species are valuable compost dwellers 
because they eat the gardener’s nemeses — snails and slugs.
Snails and slugs
Snails have protective external spiral shells; slugs are soft-bodied. 
Otherwise, they exhibit similar characteristics, including the unfortu-
nate ability to decimate your prized vegetable or flowerbed overnight. 
If you live in humid and/or rainy climates with mild winters where 
snails and slug populations are prevalent, you’re bound to come 
across them seeking fresh plant debris in your compost pile. You may 
choose to destroy them because if they — or their eggs — still reside 
in the finished compost when you spread it around your garden, 
you’ve just given them a free pass to the head of the buffet line.
Fun fact: Snails and slugs come out at night, sliding along ground 
and other surfaces with a broad muscular “foot” that leaves behind 
a mucus trail. If you don’t see these silvery slime trails, you need 
to track down a different culprit to blame for any plant destruction.

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 37
Ants
Most of the physical decomposers in your compost need moist 
conditions to survive, but ants move in to build nests only if condi-
tions are fairly dry. They’ll depart if you thoroughly moisten the 
pile and/or cook it up to high temperatures.
 
Abundant ant activity is a sign that your organic matter is too dry 
for speedy decomposition, which may or may not matter to you.
Most ants are beneficial in a compost pile, eating all kinds of stuff, 
including fungi, food scraps, seeds, and even other ants. They also 
help develop richer compost by transporting important minerals 
such as phosphorous and potassium from one area to another.
Fun fact: Ants can lift 20 times their own weight.
Flies
Flies are two-winged insects that are seldom problematic with a 
compost pile. Adult flies feed on organic material and deposit their 
eggs in compost piles to provide a ready food source for hatching 
larvae (maggots). Maggots, in turn, are eaten by mites and other 
creatures, so it’s all part of the food web.
 
If maggot populations seem out-of-control (or just gross you out), 
heat up your pile — high temperature ranges kill fly larvae.
If you experience problems with airborne pests, such as house-
flies or horseflies, buzzing around your compost pile, get out your 
pitchfork, because your pile needs attention. Properly tended com-
post doesn’t attract flies. Check out the advice in Chapter 5 on pest 
control.
Fun fact: Flies are said to carry over 1,941,000 different kinds of 
bacteria, some of which will end up in your compost pile to break 
down organic matter.
Earthworms
Earthworms are the ultimate composting machines, consuming 
and digesting organic matter to deposit their rich waste, called 
casts or castings. Earthworms are so important to the planet’s recy-
cling of organic matter and soil building, as well as your compost-
ing efforts, that they deserve their own chapter. Jump ahead to 
Chapter 10 to read about these incredible creatures.
Fun fact: Although worms have no eyes, they can sense light.

Creating a Productive 
Work Environment
Preceding sections in this chapter provide an overview of the 
major players in your compost pile. It’s fun stuff to know, but you 
don’t need to memorize the names of organisms to help them work 
efficiently. Simply create and maintain a hospitable living environ-
ment for them. Their requirements for life are similar to yours and 
mine: food, water, air, and appropriate temperature. The remain-
der of this chapter explains the best way to provide ongoing life 
support to your composting critters.
Rationing the carbons 
and nitrogens
All organic matter you add to your compost pile contains carbon 
and nitrogen in its tissues. The amounts vary widely, as the table 
“Carbon to Nitrogen Ratios” in Chapter 7 depicts.
 
Most decomposers guzzling organic matter in your compost pile 
prefer a diet that contains 30 times as much carbon as nitrogen (C:N), 
or 30:1. They use carbon-rich material for energy and nitrogen-rich 
material for building cells. The closer you come to mixing that ideal 
ratio with your ingredients, the more efficiently the organisms can 
make use of it — and the faster you obtain useable compost.
If there is considerably more carbon than nitrogen (for example, 
cardboard has a ratio of 600:1), numerous generations of organ-
isms must plow through that carbon, die to free up the limited 
nitrogen already in their bodies for the next generation of decom-
posers to use, and so on. The composting process continues as the 
limited nitrogen is recycled, but it would occur much faster if the 
ingredients’ ratios were closer to 30:1 from the start.
A cozy home for wildlife
As well as all the creatures that take an active part in the composting process, a com-
post heap is the ultimate happy home for other kinds of creatures — mostly beneficial 
ones that do gardeners a good turn. The warm, cozy, dark environment is a great place 
for frogs, toads, lizards, and newts — even slowworms and hedgehogs — especially 
in winter when it’s cold outside, so take great care to look out for all these little chaps 
when turning or emptying your heap.

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 39
Too much carbon slows things down, but too much nitrogen has 
its own unpleasant effect. If you have, for example, a mountain of 
grass clippings at 25:1 without carbons to mix with it, odor prob-
lems are not far behind. Because decomposers don’t have carbon 
to go with all that nitrogen as they work through it, excess nitro-
gen is lost to the atmosphere as smelly ammonia gas.
An easy way to juggle the ratios provided in Chapter 7’s table for 
an approximate balance is to use 3 parts carbon materials to 1 part 
nitrogen materials by volume. In other words, 3 carts full of brown 
stuff mixed with 1 cart full of green stuff. Another option is a 50-50 
mix of brown to green. Don’t get bogged down in numbers; com-
posting will still take place at other ratios, so don’t worry about 
precision. With time, you’ll develop mixes of ingredients that per-
form well for you.
Sizing down particles
In Chapter 8’s step-by-step instructions on building a basic compost 
pile, I recommend chopping up most ingredients into small pieces. I 
also mention that you don’t need complete uniformity with only tiny 
bits, because some larger chunks enhance aeration. Keep in mind 
that for the majority of your ingredients, the smaller the pieces of 
organic matter, the faster the rate of decomposition because
 
✓ Plant materials’ defense mechanisms against invasion by 
microbes are weakened by cuts, scrapes, and wounds from 
chopping and shredding.
 
✓ More surface area is created with lots and lots of small pieces. 
Increased surface area allows chemical and physical decom-
posers more avenues of attack.
 
✓ When building your pile, smaller, uniform pieces with lots of 
surface area are easier to moisten thoroughly.
 
✓ Uniform materials are easier to turn and remoisten.
 
✓ Uniform materials self-insulate and heat up faster to create a 
hot pile (more on that coming up in “Tuning the temperature”).
 
How small is small enough? Reduce the bulk of your organic matter 
into 2-inch-long (5-centimeter) bits and pieces.
Managing moisture and air
Moisture and aeration are often discussed as separate issues 
in composting, but I find it’s helpful to consider them together 
because your actions to manage water and air in the compost pile 
are closely linked.

Part I: Composting Basics  
40
Billions of pore spaces surround the organic particles in your com-
post. Pores allow air and water to circulate through the compost 
ingredients. If there’s insufficient moisture, the decomposer organ-
isms close up shop. On the other hand, if pores are flooded with 
water, airflow is hindered, and you’re stuck with a smelly anaerobic 
(without air) compost pile to deal with. (Read more about the differ-
ences between aerobic and anaerobic composting in Chapter 4.)
Your goal is to balance moisture and air levels to optimize condi-
tions for the decomposers, thereby maximizing your composting 
efforts. Here’s what you need to know.
Maintaining enough moisture
The organisms I describe earlier in this chapter require moisture 
to survive. Most of them perform their decomposing magic in ultra-
thin films of water on the surface of organic particles. When your 
pile’s moisture level drops below 35 to 40 percent and materials 
dry out, most of the creatures die or go dormant.
The ideal moisture content for your compost pile is 40 to 60 per-
cent by weight. Nope, there’s no need to weigh anything! An easy 
method to judge moisture content is to squeeze a few handfuls of 
materials from different areas of the pile. Everything should feel 
damp, like a wrung-out sponge. If it doesn’t, it’s time to add water.
 
You can help preserve existing moisture in your open compost pile 
by covering it with a tarp.
Having too much of a good thing: Drowning out air
On the other hand, soggy materials handicap your composting. 
Moisture content above 65 to 70 percent blocks air flow and devel-
ops into stinky anaerobic conditions. Nutrients also leach out of 
overly wet compost piles. If you can squeeze more than a drop or 
two of water out of a handful of ingredients, the pile is too wet.
Pore spaces in the pile provide essential oxygen for the survival of 
composting organisms. Pores also allow for the escape of carbon 
dioxide, which is a by-product of their decomposing efforts. Adequate 
aeration also helps maintain high temperatures, which produce 
faster rates of decomposition and kill weed seeds and pathogens. 
(Pile temperatures are covered in an upcoming section.)
 
If you live in extremely rainy regions, covering your pile helps 
prevent it from turning soggy during a deluge.
Finding the perfect balance
Fine-tune your pile’s moisture and air levels by:

 Chapter 3: The Decomposition Process 41
 
✓ Turning the organic matter to introduce more air and/or dry 
out wet materials. A properly aerated pile has no bad odors. If 
it smells, it’s likely too wet and needs to be turned!
 
✓ Adding dry carbon materials, such as leaves, straw, or saw-
dust, to soak up excess moisture.
 
✓ Rewetting materials if they dry out, usually at the same time 
you turn the pile.
Tuning the temperature
Most decomposing action in your compost pile occurs within two 
temperature ranges — mesophilic and thermophilic — with differ-
ent organisms thriving in each.
Mesophilic critters function from about 40 to 104 degrees 
Fahrenheit (4 to 40 degrees Celsius), although they’re most pro-
ductive in your compost pile from 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (21 
to 32 degrees Celsius). Mesophilic bacteria get busy initially on the 
easy-to-decompose materials, such as simple soluble sugars. They 
generate heat as a by-product of their frenzied eating, reproduc-
ing, and dying, which causes your compost pile’s temperature to 
rise. Unable to operate at higher temperatures, the mesophiles are 
usurped by thermophiles.
Thermophilic organisms thrive from 105 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit 
(41 to 60 degrees Celsius), although some can function up to 175 
degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius). During this hot phase, 
these heat-tolerant microorganisms start breaking down the tough 
stuff, such as complex carbohydrates.
Understanding a thermophilic compost pile
Although usually labeled as the thermophilic composting method 
(or “hot” composting), this process also contains two phases of 
mesophilic decomposition that sandwich the middle hot phase 
(see Figure 3-1):
 
1. Phase 1: Mesophilic (medium temperature) microorgan-
isms and soil invertebrates start the process.
 
 Initial temperature ranges in a compost pile vary depend-
ing on its ingredients, overall size, moisture, and aeration, 
as well as your geographic region. As a general guideline, a 
well-constructed pile’s initial temperature runs about 50 to 
70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 21 degrees Celsius) and rises 
rapidly within one to five days. Mesophilic decomposers 
dominate up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).

Part I: Composting Basics  
42
 
 The more ideal your mix of carbon to nitrogen ingredients, 
particle size, moisture, and air (see earlier sections for 
more on these components), the faster the pile will heat, 
sometimes within hours.
 
2. Phase 2: Thermophilic (high temperature) microorganisms 
take over at 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).
 
 Depending on the same pile characteristics listed in Phase 
1, as well as additional turning to increase aeration and 
remoistening as needed, temperatures jump quickly to 
120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) and may even 
reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) or more.
 
 As temperatures drop slightly after a few days, turning to 
provide more airflow causes temperatures to climb again. 
When the supply of favored foods is used up, thermophilic 
microbial activity declines, and the pile temperature drops.
 
3. Phase 3: Mesophilic creatures reassert control as tempera-
tures drop below 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
 
 In addition to microorganisms that thrive in these tempera-
tures, soil invertebrates that physically decompose plant 
material begin repopulating the pile. This final decom-
position phase can last weeks or months, depending on 
how long you let your compost “cure” before you use it. 
Temperature in the pile typically matches the surrounding 
air temperatures.
Managing the heat
Understanding these temperature phases and managing a thermo-
philic compost pile helps you to produce useable compost quickly. All 
materials eventually break down in cool, unmanaged compost piles as 
well, but decomposition occurs faster with higher temperatures. Also, 
if you need to destroy weed seeds or plant pathogens during the com-
posting process, creating a hot, thermophilic pile is essential.
Following are tips for working with a hot pile:
 
✓ Take its temperature: Use a compost thermometer (see 
Chapter 2) to take your pile’s temperature daily. Record it in 
a notebook or spreadsheet, and over time you’ll get a feel for 
how long different phases take with your composting ingredi-
ents and methods.
 
✓ Size it right: Compost piles require mass to self-insulate and 
maintain high temperatures during thermophilic composting. 
The minimum size is 3 x 3 x 3 feet (1 cubic yard or 1 cubic 
meter) up to 5 x 5 x 5 feet (1.5 cubic meters). This size allows 
the material to self-insulate and is easy to turn for a typical 
gardener. Larger sizes inhibit airflow to the center of the pile.

✓ Turn, mix, and water: Temperatures drop as supplies of 
food, air, and water are exhausted. Turning the pile to aerate, 
mixing undecomposed ingredients on the outside into the 
center, and/or adding moisture may encourage temperatures 
to rise and promote more rapid decomposition. At some 
point, food supplies are exhausted and turning the pile no 
longer boosts temperatures.
 
✓ Destroy pathogens and weed seeds: Most plant pathogens 
are destroyed if temperatures remain between 130 and 140 
degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 60 degrees Celsius) for 72 hours. 
Most weed seeds are destroyed if exposed to temperatures 

Part I: Composting Basics  
44
above 131 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) for 72 
hours. (Chapter 8 provides details on cooking up a hot pile to 
destroy weed seeds and plant pathogens.)
 
✓ Don’t overheat: Heating your pile above 170 degrees 
Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius) for more than a few hours is 
not recommended, because it inhibits most microbial activity 
and shuts down the decomposition process.
 
 If the pile is too hot, turn it to aerate the core and release heat 
build-up.

T
his part helps you sort out the best location and style 
for your composting endeavors, starting with compost-
ing at its most basic — in a freestanding pile or in a hole 
dug in the ground. It also covers the difference between 
aerobic and anaerobic composting methods and why it 
matters to you.
This part also addresses your compost container options. 
First I sort out the advantages and disadvantages of con-
tainer styles and provide advice you can use if you decide 
to purchase one; I also describe kitchen composter options 
for folks who don’t have outdoor space for a traditional 
compost system. The part closes with step-by-step instruc-
tions for numerous compost containers that you can build. 
Most of them are simple and can be made from recycled 
materials at little or no expense.

Chapter 4
Composting Aboveground 
or Underground: No 
Bin Required
In This Chapter
▶ Composting in a pile or in a pit
▶ Understanding aerobic and anaerobic decomposition
I
 wear a T-shirt that proclaims: Compost Happens. Because com-
post really does seem to “just happen,” it’s also a simple skill to 
learn, as this chapter explains. Heap up material in a freestanding 
pile or bury your kitchen scraps. Voilá! You’re officially a compos-
ter. This chapter also explains the differences between aerobic 
(with air) and anaerobic (without air) decomposition and provides 
basic steps to perform both types.
Composting Without a Container
Composting without the confines of a container takes place in two 
basic ways: aboveground in a freestanding pile or below ground in 
a hole.
Freestanding piles are just that: heaps of organic matter piled up 
without an enclosure to corral them. Underground composting, 
better known as pit or trench composting, involves digging a hole, 
throwing in your stuff, and covering it up with soil.
Following are the advantages and disadvantages associated with 
no-bin composting. If you decide that neither option suits you, 
jump ahead to Chapter 5.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
48
No-bin composting is particularly advantageous under the follow-
ing circumstances:
 
✓ If you want to try your hand at composting with as little 
expense as possible, it doesn’t get much cheaper than a pile 
of leaves and grass clippings or a hole in the ground loaded 
with kitchen scraps! You can gain experience with these meth-
ods, and then decide whether you want to “upgrade” to a 
container.
 
✓ If you have lots of yard space and elbowroom, freestand-
ing piles are fine. (It also helps if you don’t have looky-loo 
neighbors to peer with dismay upon your mounds of organic 
matter.)
 
✓ If you have lots and lots and lots and lots of organic matter, 
larger freestanding piles called windrows may suit you. Refer 
to the sidebar “Working with windrows” for more on this.
 
✓ If your ground is easy to dig, trench composting is a viable 
option.
 
✓ If you want to dispose of kitchen scraps without attracting 
pests, trench composting does the trick (see the later section, 
“Keeping Your Binless Compost Critter-Free” for more info).
 
✓ If you want to compost at the site of future planting areas, 
either method is good, and you don’t have to move containers 
around from year to year.
Of course, no-bin composting has its downsides, too. They include 
the following:
 
✓ Sprawling piles of organic matter may appear messy, unless, 
of course, you like to observe big piles of leaves, grass, and 
plant trimmings shrink into smaller piles of chocolate-brown 
compost. (Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.)
 
✓ Although you may do your best to maintain a tidy area, 
there’s no reliable way to keep pests out of freestanding piles. 
Rodents, raccoons, dogs, foxes, badgers, and others may 
gladly root around in search of something tasty to eat. (See 
the later section “Keeping Your Binless Compost Critter-Free” 
for more on this.)
 
✓ If your ground is hard, rocky, and difficult to dig, you’d have 
to be crazy to choose trench composting on a regular basis. 
Crazy!

 Chapter 4: Composting Aboveground or Underground 49
An Issue of Air: Aerobic versus 
Anaerobic Composting
Two broad categories of microorganisms consume and decompose 
organic matter: aerobic (those that need air) and anaerobic (those 
that don’t). This section helps you to understand how these micro-
organisms work and guides you in determining which type of com-
posting is best suited to your style.
Aerobic composting: Keeping 
everything aboveground
Most folks who compost do so aboveground. It’s the simplest 
method to start with because all that’s required is a pile of organic 
matter. Aerobic composting is the principle at work in aboveg-
round composting environments — whether it takes place in a 
freestanding pile or in a container that provides air circulation, 
such as a bin with open sides or a tumbler with aeration holes 
(you can see these bins in Chapter 5).
Air is the most essential ingredient in aerobic composting. If 
you’ve ever jumped and thumped through an aerobic exercise 
class and found yourself gasping for air, you know firsthand that 
oxygen is required to work out at maximum capacity. The same 
principle applies to aerobic organisms in your compost pile — 
oxygen is key to optimum performance.
Making sure aerobic organisms get enough air
As long as plenty of air is available, aerobic decomposers work 
faster and more efficiently than their anaerobic counterparts, pro-
viding you with finished compost on a faster timetable. However, 
as organisms deplete the supply of oxygen from the existing 
spaces and pores between bits of organic matter, the decomposi-
tion process slows.
To keep your decomposers working at maximum speed, you may 
want to incorporate some type of aeration aid during your initial pile 
construction. One way to do this is to pile organic materials on top 
of a recycled shipping pallet. The pallet sits several inches above the 
ground’s surface, allowing air to flow beneath it. Chapter 8 describes 
other methods you can employ when you’re building your pile to 
enhance airflow for aerobic decomposers.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
50
Continue to monitor your pile’s progress, and make adjustments 
as necessary. If you notice the height of your compost pile shrink-
ing (it may shrink as much as a foot within a few days of its initial 
construction), you can reenergize your aerobicizers by giving your 
pile a fresh infusion of oxygen. You can accomplish this in a couple 
ways:
 
✓ Turn your pile completely. Fork a freestanding heap to an 
adjacent spot or turn the contents of one bin into another. If 
using a tumbler, give it a spin.
 
✓ Stir organic matter regularly. Use a pitchfork or an aerating 
tool to stir things up (Chapter 2 describes these tools). You 
may want to do this daily for maximum results.
 
It’s not unusual to find pockets of anaerobic composting going 
on within an aboveground pile that’s meant to be aerobic-only. If 
your compost is emitting a bad odor, like rotten eggs or ammonia, 
it’s too wet or too “green” with a thick, moist layer of grass clip-
pings, fresh manure, or other nitrogen-rich organic matter that 
wasn’t thoroughly mixed with dry, carbon-rich materials, such as 
leaves or straw. These impenetrable masses don’t allow air to flow 
through, and anaerobic organisms are ready and willing to take 
over.
 
In addition to being unpleasant to work around, noxious compost 
odors may annoy neighbors, so head off potential problems by 
mixing up your initial batch of compost with appropriate amounts 
of carbon and nitrogen ingredients. If your pile emits odors, review 
the troubleshooting tips in Chapter 14, which can help you correct 
any malodorous compost adventures.
Reaping the rewards of warmth and nature’s perfume
Aboveground aerobic decomposers can withstand higher tempera-
tures than their anaerobic counterparts, and they generate heat as 
a by-product of their activity. Not all aboveground piles are “hot,” 
but when conditions are to the decomposers’ liking (as described 
in Chapter 3), temperatures in your pile heat up sufficiently to kill 
weed seeds and pathogens.
Perhaps the most potent characteristic of aerobic composting is 
that it’s a sweet-smelling project. A well-constructed compost pile 
doesn’t smell bad. In fact, it emits a refreshing earthy aroma, like 
kicking up leaves during a walk through the woods. Specialized 
aerobic bacteria called actinomycetes emit that agreeable smell as 
a byproduct of their decomposing actions. (You can read more 
about actinomycetes in Chapter 3.)

 Chapter 4: Composting Aboveground or Underground 51
Anaerobic decomposition: Working 
without air underground
Anaerobic organisms work without oxygen, so most anaerobic 
composting (at least the kind that’s done on purpose) takes place 
underground in pits or trenches. (That’s why common names for 
anaerobic composting include trench composting or pit compost-
ing.) Basically, you dig a hole, fill it with organic matter, and seal it 
with a layer of soil. Anaerobic decomposers get right to work, with 
no need for fresh O2 infusions from you.
When anaerobic composting is beneficial
Anaerobic organisms work at slower rates than their aerobic coun-
terparts, and it’s impossible to monitor their progress without dig-
ging into the hole and poking around. Unfortunately, this can be an 
odious encounter! Anaerobic organisms, unlike the sweet-smelling 
actinomycetes I describe earlier, exude smelly gas as a by-product 
of their exertions. And because they work in colder conditions, 
weed seeds and plant pathogens aren’t destroyed.
Despite these disadvantages, in some situations anaerobic com-
posting is the best way to go. It may suit you if any of the following 
apply:
 
✓ You’re looking to dispose of a one-time load of wet, poten-
tially smelly, or pest-attracting kitchen waste, such as you’d 
accumulate after a day spent canning fruits or vegetables, 
cleaning freshly caught fish, or organizing a big social gather-
ing that generates food scraps.
 
 Dig a hole in advance of the event and you’ll be all set to dis-
pose of waste. Paper napkins and plates can go in with the 
food scraps!
 
✓ Pulling spent garden plants at the end of fall leaves you with 
an enormous pile of organic matter that you don’t have the 
space or time to manage over winter.
 
✓ Aboveground composting of kitchen scraps without a sealed 
container isn’t allowed where you live.
 
✓ You aren’t keen on the appearance of a compost area in your 
landscape, but you prefer not to send your organic waste to a 
landfill.
 
✓ You want to improve soil structure and fertility in a future 
garden bed.
 
✓ You don’t have time to monitor the air or moisture require-
ments of — let alone turn — an aboveground compost pile.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
52
Taking the hardness of the ground into account
I think that becoming an anaerobic composting convert depends 
on where you live and how easy it is to dig holes in the ground. I’m 
a desert gardener where the ground is hard, rocky, compacted, 
and might even offer an impervious hardpan layer just to show the 
gardener who’s boss. I dig a planting hole over a period of days, 
because I soak the soil with water and scrape out a few inches of 
soil at a time, employing a well-worn pick ax. Voluntarily digging 
more holes just to throw in rotting organic matter is not something 
I can muster any enthusiasm for!
On the other hand, I have an arid-land gardener friend who 
practices anaerobic composting in her garden beds, where the 
improved soil is loose and easy to work with. She digs a hole, tucks 
in her day’s worth of kitchen scraps, and covers it up. She doesn’t 
want to retrieve useable compost, but allows the organic matter to 
rot in place to improve her garden beds over time.
Creating a Pile Aboveground
Creating a freestanding pile is the easiest method to break into 
composting. This section covers the basics to give you an idea of 
Converting an anaerobic pile 
to an aerobic one
A weekend composting demonstration at my county cooperative extension office 
proved to be an example of the potency of anaerobic composting. A local land-
scaper had agreed to drop a load of fresh-cut grass clippings, but unfortunately, the 
truckload arrived on Monday rather than Friday. The enormous mountain of clip-
pings languished all week in the sun without benefit of turning or mixing with other 
materials. By Saturday, when the volunteers arrived to learn about composting, this 
steaming, reeking pile illustrated all sorts of important principles!
Anaerobic creatures jump into action when materials are too wet, too compressed, 
and/or there’s a lack of air circulation — all problems exhibited by the grass moun-
tain. However, the volunteers learned that amending such a problem isn’t difficult. 
They cheerfully and thoroughly mixed the clippings with three times as much dry, 
carbon-rich materials, such as leaves, shredded paper, and straw. The mixing and 
turning processes incorporated oxygen and soaked up excess moisture. Within 
a day or so, the odors dissipated, and the newly constructed compost piles were 
decomposing nicely.

 Chapter 4: Composting Aboveground or Underground 53
the process. Refer to Chapter 9 for complete step-by-step instruc-
tions (and to understand the whys behind them) for building com-
post piles.
Where to site the pile
Location is everything according to realtors, and so it is with your 
compost pile. An ideal spot is shady (so materials don’t dry out), 
doesn’t get inundated with rain (so materials don’t get soggy), and 
within reach of your hose. It should offer sufficient space for you 
to work comfortably. Compost at least a few feet away from build-
ings so moisture from the pile doesn’t seep into foundations.
Aboveground composting 
in a few simple steps
Build a freestanding pile at least 3 feet x 3 feet x 3 feet (1 cubic yard 
or 1 cubic meter) up to 5 cubic feet (1.5 cubic meters). This size 
offers enough mass for the organic matter to self-insulate and main-
tain moisture and warmth for the microorganisms consuming it.
Chop, shred, or break as much of your organic matter as possible 
into small pieces. The smaller the pieces, the faster the rate of 
decomposition. See Chapter 7 for a list of compostable brown 
(carbon-rich) and green (nitrogen-rich) ingredients to add to 
your pile. Follow these basic steps to create your pile:
 
1. Spread 4 inches (10 centimeters) of woody, chunky, or 
coarse brown ingredients, such as straw, corn stalks, or 
dead perennial stems, as your pile’s base.
 
 This rough layer promotes aeration.
 
2. Sprinkle each layer with water as you build the pile so 
that it has the dampness of a wrung-out sponge. Also 
sprinkle in a few handfuls (or shovelfuls) of native soil 
here and there (you don’t have to add soil with every 
layer).
 
3. Spread 4 to 5 more inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of 
brown materials, such as dry leaves or shredded paper.
 
4. Spread 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of green materi-
als, such as spent garden plants and grass clippings.
 
5. Continue alternating layers of browns and greens, moisten-
ing as you build. Finish up with a layer of browns on top.

54
You have the option of covering the pile with a tarp. It helps keep 
materials from drying out in arid regions. In rainy climates, it pre-
vents the pile from getting too wet and turning anaerobic.
When your compost will 
be ready to use
The length of time needed to obtain finished compost varies 
depending on how you mix up the original elements (types of 
ingredients, size of particles, and moisture levels) and how much 
turning and remoistening you choose to do after the pile is built.
If you’re in no hurry for compost, you can leave the pile sit as is. 
However, to jumpstart the decomposition process, add a fresh 
burst of oxygen as needed (see the earlier section “Making sure 
aerobic organisms get enough air” for details). Turn the compost 
to mix materials on the outside of the pile into the interior so 
everything decomposes at a similar rate.
If you do nothing further after building your pile, in three to six 
months you’ll be able to harvest some finished compost from the 
bottom and center. Further decomposition (without turning or 
moistening) can take a year or more. Average decomposition time 
to obtain considerable finished compost from a “well-constructed” 
pile (as I describe in Chapter 8) that is regularly turned and 
remoistened is about two to three months. Chapter 8 includes 
complete details for building piles to obtain compost results in 
various timeframes.
Working with windrows
Windrow composting is a style typically used by farmers to process animal waste, 
straw bedding, and crop residue in long, narrow rows that are turned with special-
ized equipment. The same requirements of composting in small piles (carbon and 
nitrogen materials, moisture, and aeration) apply.
You can adapt windrow composting if you have sufficient space and lots of organic 
matter to process. Stack your materials 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) high and wide, 
in rows as long as you need them to be. The drawback with windrows is, of course, 
the effort involved in turning all that stuff by hand! If you plan to windrow compost 
on a regular basis, you may want to use a compact tractor or front-end loader. You 
can also let the organic matter sit without turning to decompose more slowly.

 Chapter 4: Composting Aboveground or Underground 55
Digging a Hole (Pit or 
Trench Composting)
If you live where digging holes in the ground is no big deal (lucky 
you), the following info helps you add anaerobic composting to 
your repertoire.
Where to site the hole
Because appearance isn’t an issue as it might be with aboveground 
composting, you can trench compost just about anywhere that’s 
convenient and easy for you to dig. Be sure you know where under-
ground utility lines run before digging. Good choices to consider 
include areas where you want to add a future flower, vegetable, 
or herb garden, or between rows of existing garden beds. Avoid 
marshy areas or low spots with wet soil or poor drainage.
 
Stay away from existing root systems when digging composting 
holes. Tree and shrub roots easily expand to twice the diameter of 
their aboveground canopy! Slicing through roots with a shovel cre-
ates easy wounds for pests and diseases to enter, ultimately weak-
ening and possibly killing your plant. If you’re unsure how far roots 
may have spread, stick to digging compost trenches in garden beds.
Pit composting in a few simple steps
Depending upon what you want to achieve, you can employ sev-
eral different methods of pit or trench composting, such as dig-
ging random holes, filling trench rows in garden beds, or rotating 
trenches over a three-year period to improve an expanded planting 
area. Use the basic anaerobic trench compost recipe that follows 
for whichever method you choose.
Fill ’er up
How deep and wide to dig depends on how much organic matter 
you have to compost, what kind of material it is (landscape waste 
versus kitchen waste), how easy it is to dig, and whether digging 
pests might be an issue (see the section “Keeping Your Binless 
Compost Critter-Free” for more on the latter).
 
If you want to eventually retrieve finished compost from your pit, 
realize that the deeper it is, the more cumbersome it is to remove. 
Scooping out finished compost from long, shallow trenches that 
are 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) deep is easier than retrieving 
it from deeper holes with steep sides.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
56
 
1. Dig the hole or trench, reserving the soil that you 
remove.
 
2. Follow the earlier instructions for aerobic composting. 
Starting with browns on the bottom, alternate layers of 
brown and green materials, moistening as you build.
 
 Spread a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) layer of your reserved soil 
between layers of browns and greens.
 
3. Cover with 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of soil. 
If you plan to retrieve the compost later, mark the area 
with a stone or other reminder.
Placing trenches between garden rows
If you grow flowers, herbs, or vegetables in straight rows with 
plenty of space between them, dig and fill composting trenches 
between the rows. As the organic matter in the trenches decom-
poses, nutrients become available for nearby plants. Dig trenches 
early in the planting season before vigorous roots expand into the 
area. Alternatively, dig trenches at the end of your growing season, 
so material is decomposed by the next planting season.
Preparing trenches for hungry crops
Certain plants really thrive on soil that’s rich in organic matter and 
water-holding material, particularly sweet peas, runner beans, zuc-
chini (courgettes in the United Kingdom), pumpkins, and squash.
Six to eight months before planting, dig a trench or pit where you 
plan to grow these crops, 18 inches (45 centimeters) deep. Fill with 
kitchen waste, newspaper, manure, and other retentive materials, 
then top with a 6-inch (15-centimeter) layer of soil, heaping it up to 
form a mound. By the time your planting season rolls around, the 
site will have settled and be ready for seeds or transplants.
Rotating trenches with planting areas
This method helps you develop good garden soil over time by 
rotating trench composting areas with planting areas and path-
ways that allow access to your plants.
Divide the gardening space into three equal areas: one for growing 
plants, one for pathways to access the plants, and one for trench 
composting. Each year, you can plant in the previous year’s trench, 
and shift the other areas accordingly, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1: Three-year plan for rotating trench composting with planting areas.
At the end of the three years, you’ll have improved soil in the 
entire location and be ready to repeat the process. Organic matter 
in the soil disappears through the action of decomposer organ-
isms, so it needs constant replenishment.
 
This method also helps you with a recommended gardening prac-
tice called crop rotation, in which annual vegetables and flowers 
are deliberately grown in different locales in the garden — or 
rotated — each season to prevent build-up of soil-borne pests and 
diseases.
When your compost 
will be ready to use
The speed of decomposition underground depends on factors simi-
lar to those applicable to aboveground decomposition, such as the 
ingredient mix, size of particles, and moisture level. The process 
may take anywhere from several months to a year or more.

Keeping Your Binless 
Compost Critter-Free
Actually, that header is a tad misleading. If you’re composting 
aboveground in a freestanding pile, I’m not aware of any surefire 
methods to keep pests at bay if they decide to visit (assuming you 
aren’t going to surround your compost area with an electric fence 
and stand guard 24/7). The best deterrent is to keep kitchen scraps 
out of freestanding piles. Even without scraps, some higher-ups on 
the food chain may be drawn to succulent grubs or other insects 
that inhabit the later stages of your rotting organic matter.
If you want to compost kitchen scraps without building or buying 
an enclosed bin (read more about that possibility in Chapter 5), 
burying them to decompose anaerobically is an option. Discourage 
digging pests from uprooting your tasty scraps by covering the 
organic matter with a top layer of soil at least 6 inches (15 centime-
ters) thick (8 inches [20 centimeters] is preferable), adjusting the 
depth of your hole to accommodate that top layer. Alternatively, 
cover the organic matter with something heavy that pests can’t 
push aside, such as a boulder, layer of bricks, or shipping pallet. 
Spreading a section of hardware cloth, chain link fencing, or poul-
try wire over the hole is another option — animals don’t like to get 
their feet and claws stuck in wire.
Trench composting in winter
If you garden in cold climates and plan to trench compost kitchen waste through 
the winter, dig a hole in fall before the ground freezes. Keep the removed soil close 
at hand in a pile. Cover the pile with a thick layer of straw, manure, dried leaves, 
or sod to insulate it as much as possible from freezing solid so you can dig into it 
as needed.
Layer the bottom of the hole with four to six inches of brown carbon materials, such 
as leaves or straw. Cover the hole with a sturdy tarp or slab of plywood to keep 
snow out. Add kitchen scraps throughout winter, sprinkling some of the reserved 
soil over new additions.

Chapter 5
Working with Compost 
Containers
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the benefits of containers
▶ Choosing among container styles
▶ Keeping pests away
▶ Shopping for the perfect container
A
great thing about the composting process is that there are 
so many different ways to do it. As I explain in Chapter 4, 
you can opt for a free-standing compost heap or one buried under-
ground. Or you can opt for a compost container for a more . . . 
well, contained . . . approach.
This chapter covers everything you need to know about compost-
ing containers, starting with helping you decide whether contain-
ers are right for your situation and then covering the pros and 
cons of tumblers and bins. I give you ideas for choosing among 
kitchen composters (designed to handle everyday food scraps) 
and discuss how to deal with wildlife that visits your composting 
operation. The chapter concludes with characteristics to mull over 
when buying a manufactured compost container.
Composting in a Container 
(Or Two or Three)
Mother Nature doesn’t enclose her organic debris in containers, yet 
aromatic black humus — the beneficial result of her successful com-
posting process — covers forest floors. Why should you buy or build 
a container to corral your composting efforts? Truthfully, you don’t 
have to. Freestanding piles perform the job just fine, as Chapter 4 
describes, and no particular difference exists between organic matter 
rotting in a heap and organic matter rotting in a container. However, 

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
60
as you discover in this section, there are reasons why confining 
organic matter to its quarters may be beneficial to you.
When using containers is best
Acceptable landscape aesthetics vary widely by individual, neigh-
borhood, and community standards. If you’re fortunate to live 
where local government encourages home composting to reduce 
solid waste sent to landfills, you may be surrounded by support-
ive neighbors who also compost. (I like to envision the day when 
composting replaces cars as the new “keeping up with the Jones’s” 
behavior: “Honey, the neighbors added a third bin. Get out there 
and build us another!”)
On the other hand, you may be surrounded by those who are less 
enthusiastic and don’t want to see your mounds of organic matter 
from their backyard or windows. Using containers that hide organic 
matter with fully enclosed sides or containers that you can tuck dis-
cretely into out-of-view locations forestalls potential complaints.
Other good reasons to employ containers in your composting 
efforts include the following:
 
✓ Containers keep your stockpiles of dried materials, such as 
leaves, straw, and sawdust, under control until you need 
them. Without some type of holding unit, your carefully col-
lected ingredients might end up scattered around the yard the 
next time a mighty wind blows through.
 
✓ Keeping kitchen scraps in and pests out is another important 
benefit offered by containers that are completely enclosed 
and feature secure lids. Read “Keeping Wildlife Out of Your 
Container” later in the chapter for more details.
 
✓ When it comes to efficient composting, maintaining the over-
all size and shape of your original pile of ingredients is easier 
within the confines of containers. When compost materials 
have sufficient mass (at least 1 cubic yard [1 cubic meter], as 
explained in Chapter 4), they’re better able to self-insulate to 
maintain consistent moisture levels and higher temperatures, 
conditions that speed decomposition.
 
✓ Fully enclosed bins help organic matter retain moisture, 
a characteristic that’s useful if you live in an arid climate. 
Decomposition slows down when the compost pile dries out.
 
✓ If you live in a rainy climate, enclosed bins keep heavy rains 
from soaking organic matter. Wet piles turn anaerobic and 
smelly (see Chapter 4 for details on anaerobic composting).
 
✓ Some bins offer insulating qualities that help increase and 
maintain higher temperatures inside.

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 61
Sorting out your composting style
Because I mention at the start of this chapter that you don’t need 
a container to generate compost and you’re still reading, I assume 
that you’ve decided a container makes sense for you. The ques-
tions in this section help you start sorting out your options to find 
the best container for your particular needs.
How much money do you want to spend?
Many styles of manufactured containers are showing up in the mar-
ketplace as the concepts of green living, sustainability, and compost-
ing gain in popularity. Contemplate the advantages and disadvantages 
of the manufactured containers I include later in this chapter to 
decide whether their price tag is reasonable for your budget.
 
You don’t have to purchase an expensive container to get started. 
There are many container possibilities you can produce quite easily 
(even if you’re not handy with tools) using recycled materials, such 
as 55-gallon, plastic, food-grade drums with tight-fitting lids. Drill 
drainage holes in the bottom or cut the bottom off completely, 
which also makes it easy to pick up the drum and set it aside when 
it’s time to turn or harvest compost. Chapter 6 covers other inex-
pensive options and provides step-by-step building instructions.
How much organic matter will you process?
You may have moved into a new home and want to start a garden, 
but you have no idea how much organic matter your landscape 
and household will produce. Or you may have bagged copious 
quantities of grass clippings all summer and then switched to 
raking mountains of leaves in autumn (and paid to have your trash 
disposal company haul it all away, depending on where you live), 
and you have a good estimate of the amount of organic matter 
your household generates.
Whatever your situation, it may help you to think of composting in 
containers as a “modular” system. If you’re uncertain how much 
organic matter you’ll have, start off with a single square bin from the 
options I describe in Chapter 6, such as concrete blocks, shipping 
pallets, or even straw bales. As you gain experience and get bitten by 
the compost “bug,” you can easily expand your operation. The square 
shape makes it a snap to add a second or third adjacent bin. The 
three-bin composting method is perfect for processing a lot of organic 
matter (see the section “Bins of all types” later in this chapter).
How much space do you have for a composting area?
Check out possible areas in your landscape, and estimate whether 
containers will fit in the areas you’re thinking about. Factor in 

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost

elbow room for comfortable movement, including turning the pile 
by hand or filling a wheelbarrow or cart with finished compost.
 
Some local governments or homeowner’s associations may have 
restrictions on composting activities, such as “no kitchen scraps 
aboveground” or “bins can’t be seen from the street.” Although a 
three-bin system made from shipping pallets may stand out, there 
are other options that you can tuck into an out-of-sight corner. I 
also offer a variety of methods for disposing of kitchen scraps in 
the section “Kitchen composters” later in the chapter.
Checking Out Your Options
This section describes characteristics of different container styles, 
including tumblers, bins, and kitchen composters. There are 
numerous options to suit different situations. If something here 
doesn’t catch your eye, get busy on the drawing board inventing a 
new style!
Taking a turn with tumblers
Soil organisms decomposing your organic matter need a steady 
supply of oxygen to function at maximum potential, as Chapter 3 
describes. Also, mixing organic materials on the outside of a pile 
into the inside so that everything decomposes evenly is a good 
practice. Tumbling composters are designed to do precisely that: 
You rotate or tumble them to facilitate the incorporation of oxygen 
and the mixing of ingredients without swinging a pitchfork or 
poking the pile with an aerating tool.
A basic tumbler style is shaped like a canister that you roll around 
the yard. Other styles include a large drum that rests on its 
aboveground stand with a hand crank to turn it, and smaller units 
that you grasp and spin as they rest on slightly concave pads on 
the ground.
One problem I’ve experienced with tumblers is that fresh, moist 
materials occasionally clump into a compacted heavy ball within 
the first few days of rotating. The big blob of organic matter loses 
out on the benefits of aeration offered by tumbling. Figure 5-1 illus-
trates a tumbler style that contains a metal rod running through its 
center. As the materials tumble within, they fall and break against 
the rod, which helps to prevent clods from forming. Of course, if 
you have another tumbler style, you may break up any clods that 
form with a tool or your gloved hands.

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 63
Figure 5-1: A tumbling compost container.
 
An oft-touted advantage of tumblers is that they make it easy to turn 
compost. In theory this is true, but in practice, an oversize tum-
bler fully loaded with moist organic matter is not lightweight and 
requires some strength to rotate. A properly moistened composting 
effort starts out with 40 to 60 percent water by weight. How easily 
you can turn the unit depends upon its style and weight, how much 
and what type of organic matter it’s filled with (fresh moist manure 
weighs more than dry straw, for example), and any physical limita-
tions you may have. If you like the notion of a tumbler but harbor 
any physical concerns, find fellow composters in your area who will 
let you take their tumblers out for a spin. Ask local garden clubs. 
Some gardens open to the public also open up their composting 
areas. Don’t be shy. I’ve never met a composter who didn’t enjoy 
sharing stories about their composting experiences.
You may also consider a smaller tumbling unit that’s easier to 
rotate. However, composting is most efficient (giving you finished 
compost faster) when the bulk of organic matter starts out at least 
1 cubic yard (1 cubic meter) in size (3 feet tall by 3 feet wide by 3 
feet deep, or 1 meter each way). If your container is considerably 
smaller, the process will take longer. Of course, this is true of any 
container style, not just tumblers. The importance of container 
size is discussed further in the sidebar “Testing a tumbler.”
Finally, a tumbler’s enclosed sides foil pests from rooting through 
the organic matter for kitchen scraps. If the tumbler sits on the 
ground, ensure that its access panels fasten securely. (Some crit-
ters are mighty clever at opening things.) Tumblers that rest 
on aboveground stands are even more pest-proof, but they also 
require tight-fitting doors.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
64
Bins of all types
I define “bin” pretty broadly for this discussion. Just about any 
container that isn’t a tumbler falls into the bin category. Following 
are characteristics to consider.
Open or closed
Open bins are just that: Some combination of their top, sides, and 
bottom are open to the air, precipitation, and pests. Examples 
include homemade square bins made of shipping pallets and man-
ufactured circular enclosures made of lightweight recycled plastic 
with pre-formed ventilation holes, such as the Presto GEOBIN 
(check it out at www.prestoproducts.com/consumer/garden/
bins.htm). Open bins have a number of advantages:
 
✓ They’re easier and less expensive to erect, with fewer con-
struction materials required.
 
✓ Adding more compostables over time is easy.
 
✓ Stirring up the mix with an aerating tool is easy.
 
✓ Open ground beneath the bin allows soil organisms to gain 
quick access, speeding decomposition.
 
✓ Open sides and/or an open top take advantage of free air and 
water (and snow).
Testing a tumbler
A disadvantage to some tumblers (as well as non-tumbling containers) is that their 
size doesn’t hold sufficient organic matter for fast and efficient composting. I saw 
this firsthand when trying different styles at my county cooperative extension dem-
onstration site. What started out as less than 1 cubic yard (1 cubic meter) of mate-
rial (the minimum size for efficient decomposition) shrunk in half within days. This 
is good and bad. You want the material to get smaller in volume as it decomposes, 
but now the overall bulk is much smaller than the ideal size to self-insulate and 
maintain heat. Tumbling (adding air) cools the temperature of the organic matter for 
a short time until the decomposers rev up again. But with limited material, the pile 
doesn’t have sufficient mass to reheat up to high temps. We monitored tempera-
tures and moisture, adjusted the content and ratio of materials, and poked, prodded 
and peered into the depths to fine-tune the process. Ultimately, we determined 
that our fine-tuning took more time than the plain square open bin that was turned 
a couple times with a pitchfork and left alone. It always produced more compost, 
faster than the tumblers. I’m not saying these units won’t work for you, just that they 
aren’t magical. Someone still needs to manage the show!

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 65
But they also have some disadvantages:
 
✓ Open sides and/or an open top allow material to dry out faster 
or become too wet, depending on climate.
 
✓ Pests have easy access.
 
✓ The appearance of organic matter may be unsightly.
Closed bins are sealed from the elements. Homemade wooden bins 
with hinged tops and sheet metal bottoms (with drainage holes) 
serve as an example. Many manufactured options are available, such 
as tumblers (see the earlier section “Taking a turn with tumblers”) 
or square plastic bins, similar to the one shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2: A plastic, closed compost container.
Like open bins, closed ones have some advantages. Closed bins
 
✓ Hide organic matter for a tidier appearance
 
✓ Retain moisture and heat more evenly
 
✓ Inhibit pest access (see “Keeping Wildlife Out of Your 
Container” later in the chapter)
Following are the downsides to closed bins:
 
✓ They require more materials, making them potentially more 
expensive.
 
✓ Adding and accessing organic materials is more difficult.
 
✓ They’re often smaller in size, thus holding less organic material.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
66
Stationary versus movable
Stationery bins sit in one place for the duration, unless you exert 
time and effort to relocate them. Examples include a bin made of 
concrete blocks or a wooden three-bin unit (see Chapter 6).
Movable composters are free to “get up and move around the 
cabin.” Or, more accurately, you’re free to move them around your 
yard with little effort. This is a nice feature if you have just one 
container and want to turn your compost regularly to aerate or 
remoisten it. Lift the container off the pile, set it aside, and fork or 
shovel the organic matter back in. Examples of easy-to-move con-
tainers include a homemade wire enclosure, a lightweight plastic 
model without a bottom, and a manufactured wire bin with collaps-
ible sides, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: A wire compost bin with collapsible sides.
Multi-bin systems
Just one square bin can hold and produce a significant amount of 
organic matter, and an advantage of a basic square shape is that 
you can quickly add second or third adjacent bins to meet chang-
ing needs for more composting space. (Or you can remove a bin 
if you need less space.) If you answer “yes” to any or all of the fol-
lowing questions, you may feel most comfortable starting with just 
one square bin:
 
✓ Are you new to composting?
 
✓ Are you unsure how much organic material your yard and 
household will generate?
 
✓ Are you unsure how much time and effort you want to put 
into composting?

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 67
As you gain experience, you can easily add adjacent second and 
third bins. You may eventually reach the composting output of a 
friend of mine who used six bins in a row at a community garden! 
By the time organic matter reached the last bin, it was dark, rich 
compost, ready to incorporate into the garden.
Following are a few more questions to consider:
 
✓ Do you plan to maintain compost piles throughout the year, 
adding new materials as they become available?
 
✓ Does your yard and household generate a considerable 
amount of organic matter that you want to recycle?
 
✓ Do you want to generate a lot of finished compost?
 
✓ Do you enjoy turning organic materials by hand?
If you answered “yes” to any or all of those questions, you’re a 
prime candidate for a three-bin compost system. Three squarish 
bins share common sidewalls. This style uses space efficiently and 
makes it convenient to turn organic material from one bin into the 
next. Basically, you fill Bin #1 with organic matter and start it cook-
ing. When it’s partially decomposed and ready to turn, you shift it 
into Bin #2 and start a new pile of fresh organic matter in Bin #1. 
When Bin #2 decomposes further, you turn it into Bin #3 to finish 
decomposing. And so the cycle continues. (Chapter 8 offers com-
plete instructions for using three bins efficiently.)
Of course, you can always just split the difference with a two-bin 
system, rotating organic matter back and forth.
Kitchen composters
Not all products sold as kitchen composters create useable com-
post from your kitchen waste. Some are simply attractive hold-
ing units that blend unobtrusively with your kitchen décor until 
you have time to dump the organic matter into your outdoor bin. 
Others, such as bokashi composters, start the decomposition ball 
rolling, but you must eventually transfer the organic matter out-
doors, either to a compost pile or to a hole in the ground where 
it continues to decompose into substances that improve soil and 
provide nutrients to plants. (See Chapter 4 for details on trench 
composting.)
An outdoor option for composting kitchen waste is an under-
ground “food digester,” such as the Green Cone designed to deter 
pests.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
68
 
But what do you do with kitchen scraps if you live in an apart-
ment or condo with zero access to outdoor space for composting? 
Consider harboring a bin of worms to chow down on your food 
waste. Called vermicomposting, this method is fascinating and 
effective. Worms consume at least half their weight in food per 
day. So, if you have a pound of worms, they’ll process about a half 
pound of scraps. Chapter 10 provides the complete rundown on 
how to set up a squirm of worms.
If worms aren’t your thing, another indoor option that produces 
finished compost is an electric-powered unit that mixes and aer-
ates just about all kitchen scraps, including meats, fish, and dairy. 
Finished compost drops into a holding tray where it continues to 
cure and you can access it when convenient.
I describe all these options (except the worms) for composting 
kitchen waste in more detail in the following sections.
Countertop crocks
You may find it convenient to stockpile kitchen scraps destined 
for your outdoor bin in a small countertop container within handy 
reach of food prep areas. Resembling miniature garbage cans 
or ice buckets, these units hold about a gallon’s worth of scraps 
(that’s about 3.8 liters).
 
Look for crocks that feature tight-fitting lids and activated charcoal 
filters within the lid to keep odors in check. Bad smells or fly inva-
sions shouldn’t occur if you empty the container regularly — every 
couple days or at least weekly, depending on what you’re filling it 
with and the temperature in your house. Filters last about three 
months. Factor in the cost of replacement filters when making your 
purchase decision.
You don’t have to buy a special product to stockpile kitchen 
scraps. Toss them into a plastic food storage container with a 
tight lid and store it in the freezer to forestall any odors and flies. 
Transfer it to your outdoor compost operation when convenient. 
Rinse the container outdoors and pour the water on the compost 
pile contents.
 
Rub lemon juice, vinegar, or baking soda inside kitchen scrap 
collection containers to remove odors naturally.
Bokashi composting
Bokashi is a Japanese term referring to a process of fermenting 
organic matter. Bokashi kitchen composting mixes scraps with 
an inoculant (called bokashi) of beneficial microorganisms that 
hasten fermentation anaerobically (without oxygen), while avoiding 

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 69
the offensive odors typical of anaerobic decomposition. (Read 
more about anaerobic composting in Chapter 4.) Bokashi inoculant 
is usually sold as dry wheat or rice bran embedded with microor-
ganisms and their food source, such as molasses.
Bokashi containers don’t create useable compost. The closed 
system ferments (pickles) kitchen scraps, starting the breakdown of 
organic matter. At the end of the fermenting period, food scraps are 
still recognizable because they’re pickled, not decomposed. Final 
decomposition takes place outdoors after you bury the material in 
the soil or a compost bin. Consider the following advantages and 
disadvantages to decide whether a bokashi system is right for you.
Here are the pros of utilizing a bokashi system:
 
✓ The initial indoor fermentation period makes food waste less 
of a draw for pests after transferring it outdoors.
 
✓ Soil microbes quickly break down remaining organic matter 
after the material is placed outdoors.
 
✓ Food wastes that must be kept out of traditional, open-to-the-
air (aerobic) compost bins, such as meat and dairy, can be 
put in a bokashi container.
 
✓ The container commands only a small amount of indoor space.
 
✓ Liquid drained off during the fermentation period can be 
highly diluted and used as a plant food.
Of course, the bokashi system has its downsides, too. These 
include the following:
 
✓ Purchasing bokashi is an ongoing expense.
 
✓ Scraps must be chopped into small pieces.
 
✓ Rotten or moldy scraps should not be composted.
 
✓ Material must be buried outdoors at least 8 to 12 inches deep 
in the soil or compost pile after initial fermentation.
 
✓ Two or more containers are needed to continue processing 
scraps while the first container ferments.
Bokashi composting requires an airtight container, with an 
optional spout at the base for draining liquid created during fer-
mentation. (Dispose of liquid or dilute one part liquid with 100 
parts water and use it to fertilize plants.) You can buy containers 
or make your own from a five-gallon bucket with a tight lid.
Enter “bokashi composting” into your favorite Internet search 
engine to explore the method, including finding bokashi inoculant 
and instructions for creating and using a bokashi container.

Green Cone
The Green Cone composter is sometimes described as an in-
ground food digester. It can handle all sorts of kitchen waste and 
food scraps, including meats, fish, bones, dairy, and oils. However, 
if you’re going to add those items, secure the unit from pests (see 
the tip later in this section).
The Green Cone has four parts: an underground basket, two 
aboveground cones, and a lid. Bury the bottom, and all those won-
derful soil organisms described in Chapter 3 can climb right in and 
get to work breaking down your scraps. Aboveground, the Green 
Cone looks like, well, a green cone. Within it is a second, smaller 
cone that fits securely over the bottom portion to inhibit pests. 
You pop your kitchen scraps in the top cone, which has a lid.
The Green Cone wasn’t designed to produce useable finished com-
post. It’s intended to recycle food scraps and keep them out of the 
waste stream. Most materials will break down into carbon dioxide 
and liquids that spread into the surrounding soil. Alternatively, 
you can harvest residue that remains in the basket after 9 to 12 
months and add it to a compost pile or bury it in your garden.
The primary advantages of the Green Cone are that it
 
✓ Keeps all kitchen scraps out of the waste stream.
 
✓ Doesn’t need turning or mixing.
 
✓ Requires limited outdoor space to set up.
The main disadvantages of the Green Cone are that it
 
✓ Doesn’t produce much useable compost.
 
✓ Needs excellent soil drainage and a sunny location to work at 
peak efficiency.
 
✓ May attract digging pests.
 
✓ May fill with organic material faster than decomposition 
occurs. If the cone becomes 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 full, organic matter (which 
may be wet and stinky) needs to be removed and buried in 
the garden or other compost pile. Operating two units simul-
taneously reduces this problem. One can be left to decom-
pose while the other is filled with fresh scraps.
 
To forestall pests digging around or into your Green Cone, wrap 
the underground basket in tight wire mesh, such as hardware 
cloth, before burying it. After installing the unit, firmly compact 
the surrounding soil and cover it with bricks, rocks, or pavers to 
discourage animals that are drawn to freshly dug soil. If pests are a 
problem, limit attractive ingredients, such as meat, fish, and dairy.

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 71

where to purchase one, online at www.greencone.com.
NatureMill
This automatic, electric-powered unit includes an upper chamber 
that holds food scraps and a lower chamber for finished compost. 
A heater keeps the upper chamber’s contents warm to facilitate 
decomposition. A fan pulls air in, and it exits via an air filter to 
control odor. The unit’s computer chip tells the motor when to 
operate the upper chamber’s mixing bar, which rotates for several 
minutes at a time (that’s the mesmerizing stage). When organic 
matter has decomposed sufficiently, the unit sends it through a 
trap door into a holding tray in the bottom chamber. There, it sits 
to “cure” further until you’re ready to harvest it. In the meantime, 
you refill the upper chamber with more scraps.
The most enticing features of the NatureMill composter are that it
 
✓ Composts typical kitchen scraps as well as meat, fish, dairy, 
and oils
 
✓ Accommodates up to 4 pounds per day, so you can add 
scraps as frequently as you want
 
✓ Works fast to turn scraps into compost
 
✓ Operates indoors or outdoors (with electric plug)
 
✓ Features a compact size — 20 inches high x 20 inches long x 
12 inches wide (50.8 x 50.8 x 30.5 centimeters, respectively)
Following are a few disadvantages of the system:
 
✓ The motor that turns the mixing bar is noisier than the unit’s 
ongoing low hum.
 
✓ Scraps need to be chopped into 4-inch pieces.
 
✓ The unit is more expensive than some other options.

Keeping Wildlife Out 
of Your Container
Depending on where you live, creatures attracted to a compost 
pile may include rodents, cats, dogs, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, 
badgers, and javelina. In some regions, even bears may appear in 

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost

backyards as development spreads into their ranges and normal 
food supplies become scarce.
 
People are the ones usually encroaching on the animals’ territory — 
don’t blame them for seeking food.
When wild creatures tangle with humans, the animals are usu-
ally the losers, so it’s better to deter them from the get-go rather 
than try to change their routine once they’ve discovered there’s 
a regular food supply in your backyard. You can do this by elimi-
nating specific ingredients from your compost and by using bins 
with characteristics that prevent animal access (or at least make it 
more difficult).
Eliminating enticing ingredients
Don’t put meat, fish, bones, dairy products, grease, or oil in your 
compost bin. This simple step reduces the likelihood of midnight 
prowlers rooting through your pile. Avoid using blood meal as 
a nitrogen source or accelerator to speed up the composting 
process (you can find more on accelerators in Chapter 8). Its 
scent, though not particularly noticeable to humans, may attract 
unwanted critters to the pile, including your family dog. Cover 
kitchen scraps or vegetable garden trimmings with an 8-inch layer 
of dry brown materials, such as leaves, straw, or organic matter 
that’s in the process of decomposing. Using two or three side-by-
side bins makes this easy. Pitchfork or shovel material stockpiled 
in one bin onto the freshly added scraps in a second bin.
Using bin characteristics 
to exclude creatures
Manufacturers of compost bins know that animals can be pretty 
smart when it comes to gaining access to the contents of your bin, 
so they design their bins with specific features that help keep ani-
mals out. The following bin styles and features inhibit unwanted 
access:
 
✓ Fully enclosed bins (including solid bottoms) with securely 
latched lids
 
✓ Tumblers resting on aboveground supports
 
✓ Small aeration holes or holes covered with wire mesh
 
✓ Bin styles designed to deter pests such as the Green Cone 
(refer to the earlier section)

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 73
 
When building your own bins or modifying less secure manufac-
tured bins, these ideas may help you prevent pests from gaining 
access:
 
✓ Cover aeration holes with hardware cloth or wire mesh to pre-
vent rodents from squeezing through. (Rodents chew plastic 
mesh.)
 
✓ Build wood bins with tight mesh wire sides and hinged, fiber-
glass or wood lids.
 
✓ Place heavy covers (such as wood shipping palettes) on the 
top of large open bins to block easy access.
 
✓ Set bricks on top of easy-to-remove lids.
Bugs, ants, and flies, oh my!
Insects are an essential component of a healthy compost pile, so 
don’t sweat their presence. Read more about who’s doing what in 
the compost pile in Chapter 3. If you follow the steps in Chapters 7 
and 8 for constructing and maintaining your pile, the likelihood of 
harboring hosts of undesirable pest insects is slim.
Bugs
When did humans become so “bug-averse?” In fact, critters of all 
sorts that inhabit the pile don’t do much harm and can provide you 
with quite a sideshow. When I turn compost, lizards scurry closer 
along the block wall to get a look at juicy offerings that my pitchfork 
may have uncovered. I don’t even have to stand still; a bold lizard 
will dash in, grab its take-out meal, and head home with dinner hang-
ing from its mouth. If I turn my back for a minute, birds also hop 
about the pile, snapping up juicy white grubs unearthed in finished 
compost. Be on the lookout to see what intriguing native creatures 
may be feasting on insects from your compost heap.
Ants
Unlike flies that set course for a wet pile, ants like dry living quar-
ters. Moistening and turning the pile frequently can send them 
packing. Some regular ants always seem to be scurrying through a 
compost pile, and they aren’t a reason for concern. However, if you 
have nasty biting ants, get them under control as soon as possible 
so they don’t spread colonies to other areas of your landscape. For 
a natural pesticide treatment, try one of the following:
 
✓ Spinosad: This is a pesticide derived from a naturally occur-
ring soil bacterium. If you’re an organic gardener, look for a 
product that states on its container that spinosad is the active 
ingredient and that it’s certified for use in organic gardens.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
74
 
✓ Orange peel slurry: To make a slurry, grind orange peels with 
water in a blender. Flood the ant mound with the slurry imme-
diately after making it so it doesn’t lose its effectiveness.
 
✓ Boiling water: Pouring boiling water in the mound is another 
option.
 
✓ Aromatic plant: The pungent yet pleasant smell of a particu-
lar mint species (Mentha requienii) deters ants. You may find 
it for sale as Corsican mint in the United States or pennyroyal 
mint in the United Kingdom.
Flies
If you find yourself with the problem of annoying insects, you’re 
most likely dealing with household flies. Flies are drawn to moist, 
rotting organic matter on which they lay their eggs. Hatching fly 
larvae (better known by the unpleasant-sounding moniker maggots) 
remain in the pile three to five days, guzzling down organic matter 
before pupating and emerging as adult flies to repeat the cycle.
If you have troublesome numbers of flies buzzing around, your pile 
needs attention. Assess your pile’s conditions and ingredients to 
determine whether you need to implement one of these corrective 
measures:
 
✓ Turn the pile. This introduces oxygen to dry out overly 
wet material and/or heat up the pile. (Fly larvae die in high 
temperatures.) Make sure materials on the outer edges get 
worked into the center so that everything has a chance to 
“feel the heat.”
 
✓ Add more green nitrogen materials, such as grass clippings or 
manure, to boost heat levels.
 
✓ Add more dry carbon materials (such as leaves or straw) to 
counteract an abundance of overly wet nitrogen materials 
(like manure, grass clippings, and coffee grounds).
 
✓ Always bury food scraps within the center of the pile or cover 
fresh additions with an 8-inch (20-centimeter) layer of dry 
leaves or straw.
Shopping for a Composter: 
A Buyer’s Guide
The most common frustration I hear from gardeners about com-
posting in manufactured bins sounds something like this: “It takes 
longer than I thought it would to produce finished compost.” 
Unfortunately, compost containers (despite some of the marketing 

 Chapter 5: Working with Compost Containers 75
materials that accompany them) aren’t magical devices whereby 
you drop in straw, wave your wand-like compost thermometer, 
and presto — out spills black gold! The basic needs of decomposer 
organisms must still be met, including an appropriate mix of carbon 
and nitrogen materials chopped into small pieces, moisture and aer-
ation during the process, and sufficient mass to build up and retain 
temperature levels. Your efforts in meeting these requirements favor 
the types of mesophilic and thermophilic organisms that do the bulk 
of the work. You can read all about them in Chapter 3.
Whether tumblers or bins, containers have common characteris-
tics as described in the following list. Considering these options 
sets you on the right path to choosing the container that’s best for 
your situation:
 
✓ Size: When comparison shopping, keep in mind that a con-
tainer’s size is often the limiting factor in its ability to produce 
compost quickly. If the container holds less than 1 cubic yard (1 
cubic meter) of materials (the minimum size for efficient decom-
position), you can still work with it. But you need to manage the 
contents, air, moisture, and temperature more regularly if you 
want speedy compost, just as you would with a freestanding 
pile or homemade bin. If you’re in no hurry and just want a tidy 
receptacle to contain a relatively small amount of organic left-
overs, then container size is not as important a factor. Of course, 
don’t forget that a big container typically weighs more as well!
 
✓ Weight: If it’s a tumbler, you want to be able to easily rotate it 
when it’s full of heavy, wet organic matter. If it’s not a tumbler, 
and you use just one container, it’s nice to be able to lift it up and 
off the organic matter to set it aside for turning or reloading.
 
✓ Height: Make sure you can easily lift your pitchfork or shovel 
loaded with organic materials into the container. It’s typically 
less fatiguing to rest your pitchfork or shovel on the side of 
the container as you empty it, rather than to hoist it upwards 
above shoulder level.
 
✓ Assembly required: Most bins require some assembly. 
Connectors such as screws or bolts usually hold up longer 
than plastic tabs that crack or break after a season or two in 
extreme weather. Look for sturdy, rigid construction at joints. 
Loose connections can come apart and cause the container 
to collapse when you’re poking around in the midst of the bin 
with a tool to aerate organic matter.
 
✓ Lids: Look for sufficiently large top openings to add fresh 
organic matter. Will your loaded-up pitchfork or shovel fit 
with room to spare? Or do you need to use your hands to stuff 
materials in? Perhaps you’d like a smaller access door within 
the lid that you can flip open to toss in the day’s kitchen 
scraps without removing the entire lid.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
76
 
✓ Pest deterrents: Lids should tighten securely to protect 
against enterprising pests and strong winds. At the same time, 
you want to be able to lift lids to add more organic matter 
without a lot of fuss. Containers should be fully enclosed, 
including a solid or tight wire-mesh bottom. Some open-to-the-
ground containers have optional bottoms that you can buy. 
Containers lifted on stands above ground level are also good 
pest deterrents, but they still need secure lids to foil climbers.
 
 Check with your regional parks department, game and fish, wild-
life, or other natural resource management agencies for informa-
tion on local pest problems and recommended deterrents.
 
✓ Access panels: Some units offer sliding trap doors at the 
bottom to provide access to the finished compost. Check 
the dimensions to see whether your spade will fit inside. 
Otherwise, you’ll need to scoop compost out by hand or use 
a hand trowel. Some units have panels on multiple sides. If 
the composter has no bottom, lifting it up and setting it aside 
to get at your finished product is often easier than poking 
around in small portholes.
 
✓ Aeration and drainage holes: Air and water are important 
ingredients in composting. If bins are fully enclosed, there 
must be some method for allowing air in and moisture out. 
Without drainage, the contents of the container turn wet and 
stinky and the decomposition process slows.

Chapter 6
Erecting Your Own 
Compost Containers
In This Chapter
▶ Recycling materials to create compost bins
▶ Building bins in various styles and materials
W
hen it comes to compost bin construction, you can get by 
just fine with a simple and inexpensive bin you build your-
self. After all, composting occurs when organic matter is piled in a 
heap and left to rot (as I describe in Chapter 4), so obviously the 
decomposer organisms don’t care if a high-rise condo surrounds 
their food supply. However, after getting a primer on composting 
containers in Chapter 5, you may have decided to organize your 
composting area with some type of structure.
Before you head out to buy a manufactured bin, I suggest getting 
your feet wet with one or more of the basic bin styles I describe 
in this chapter. You’ll learn just as much about the composting 
process with these options, and your experiences may highlight 
useful features in a manufactured bin. (On the other hand, you may 
discover that your homemade bin suits you perfectly, and you can 
use the money you would have spent on a bin to purchase more 
plants for your garden!)
With the exception of the wood and wire three-bin system, all the 
bins I describe in this chapter are easy to make, as you can see 
from the step-by-step instructions. I know they’re easy, because 
I’ve tried them all over the years, and I don’t consider myself very 
handy in the tool or carpentry departments!
Some bin construction progresses more smoothly with an extra 
set of hands or physical strength, and I note instances where this 
is the case, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each 
style, a materials list, and step-by-step instructions.

Transforming Recycled Items 
into Inexpensive Containers
Because composting is all about recycling organic matter, it seems 
appropriate for composting bins to be made from recycled materi-
als as well. The two bin options I describe in this section warm recy-
clers’ hearts. You’re likely to obtain them at no cost — or dirt-cheap.
Wood shipping pallets
Wood shipping pallets are used as platforms to support con-
sumer goods being transported by forklifts and other equipment. 
Recycled pallets are my favorite option for creating easy-to-build 
and highly effective composting systems, especially when you 
have a lot of organic matter to process.
Every composting container has its advantages and disadvantages, 
and converted pallets are no exception. Following are a few of the 
pros and cons:
 
✓ Advantages
 
• Cost: They’re free! You’ve probably seen pallets piled at 
construction sites or stacked at loading docks behind 
businesses and warehouses, awaiting recycling or dis-
posal. Explain to the head honcho you’d like to recycle 
some to make a compost bin. Most places pay to have 
them hauled away and are happy to oblige. Look pallets 
over to make sure they’re in decent shape before carting 
them home.
 
• Size: Pallets are presized to perfection. No measuring, 
no cutting, no hammering. Pallet sizes vary considerably 
based upon country, industry standards, and the type 
of goods being transported, but to simplify, in North 
America, pallets commonly measure 40 x 48 inches, 
which creates a bin size that is ideal for composting. 
A comparable European Union pallet size for effec-
tive composting is 1,000 x 1,200 millimeters. Don’t feel 
obligated to find these exact sizes. Many other options 
work, as long as they provide you with a 3- to 6-foot (1- 
to 2-meter) square shape.

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 79
 
✓ Disadvantages
 
• Weight: Depending on size and type of wood, a single 
pallet can weigh 20 to 50 pounds (9 to 23 kilograms). 
Heft it and see whether you can comfortably move it 
around. If not, keep searching for others.
 
• Portability: Pallets aren’t as easy to reposition around 
the yard as some choices, but they’re still faster to move 
and set up than concrete blocks or straw bales.
 
• Openness to pests: See Chapter 5 for ideas on inhibiting 
pests.
Materials
All you need to gather for this project are pallets, ties, and a tool to 
cut the ties, and you’re ready to get started. Here are the specifics:
 
✓ Four same-sized pallets per bin. Pallets with narrow spaces 
between slats hold back organic materials better than those 
with wide spaces.
 
✓ Baling wire or nylon rope to lash pallets together at the corners.
 
✓ Wire cutters or a utility knife to cut ties.
Instructions
One person can assemble a shipping pallet compost bin, although 
it goes smoother with two: one to hold the pallets upright and 
steady while the other ties them together. Follow these steps to 
erect the bin shown in Figure 6-1:
 
1. Level the ground where your bin will be.
 
2. Set the pallets upright in a box shape.
 
3. Lash the pallets securely together at the corners with 
wire or rope ties.
 
 The front pallet acts as a hinged door, allowing you to 
access your compost by undoing the ties on one side and 
swinging it open. You can also remove the entire pallet to 
have wider access when adding or turning organic matter.
 
Add second and third bins to your first shipping pallet bin using 
common side walls. You need three pallets for each additional bin.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
80
Figure 6-1: Shipping pallet compost bin.
Recycled garbage can
Another inexpensive recycling option for a compost container is a 
large, recycled garbage can. Contact the department responsible 
for trash pickup (it may be called solid waste disposal) in your area, 
whether it be a town, city, county, or other office. Many communities 
recycle their no-longer-useable garbage cans as compost contain-
ers to residents, either free or for a nominal fee. You may want to 
gather a group of neighbors (including someone with a truck) to 
pick up several at once.
 
Check with these same municipal departments (or the Council 
departments in the United Kingdom) to see whether they offer 
reduced prices on manufactured compost containers. Some may 
offer promotions (even free manufactured containers) to encour-
age community involvement in composting, recycling, and waste 
reduction.
Garbage can styles vary, of course. Some come with secure lids, 
which is great if you want to keep pests out. Most agencies have 
already removed any wheels on the can. Some may remove the 
bottom of the trash can and/or punch aeration holes. If you have a 
preference for bottom/no bottom or holes/no holes, ask in advance 
to see whether your request can be accommodated.

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 81
Using recycled garbage cans as composting bins has upsides and 
downsides:
 
✓ Advantages
 
• Cost: They’re free or inexpensive.
 
• Portability: They’re easy to move to different areas in 
the garden.
 
• Protection from pests: Cans with lids keep pests at bay.
 
✓ Disadvantages
 
• Size and shape: Most garbage cans aren’t quite large 
enough to contain the optimal amount of organic matter 
(1 cubic yard or 1 cubic meter) needed to self-insulate 
and promote fast decomposition.
 
• Appearance: With apologies to Gertrude Stein, a gar-
bage can is a garbage can is a garbage can. Let your kids 
loose on it with some paints and brushes to dress it up a 
bit, or hide the can in the back corner of your landscape!
Materials
The great thing about this compost bin project is that it requires 
so little — a recycled garbage receptacle obtained from your 
municipality. If this isn’t an option where you live, you may check 
with neighbors or put an advertisement in your local paper or on 
Web sites asking to recycle a can someone is tossing.
Instructions
Not surprisingly, lifting or moving the bin into position is the most 
challenging part of erecting a recycled garbage can compost bin. 
You just set your can in place and start filling it up (see Chapter 8 
for compost ingredients). Wasn’t that easy?
Building Bins with Wire, 
Bales, or Wood
If recycled shipping pallets or garbage containers aren’t available 
to you, this section covers a variety of other options for you to 
construct. Some of them may cost you nothing if you’re able to 
repurpose or scrounge the supplies. Others require a more sub-
stantial investment but pay off in the end.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost

Hardware cloth circular wire bin
When you only have enough space for one bin to corral and turn 
your compost, my personal favorite is a simple, circular enclosure 
made of mesh wire hardware cloth. When compost is ready to be 
turned, lift the lightweight wire bin, set it to the side of the pile, 
and fork the organic matter back in for another round of decompo-
sition. Select an original site that gives you enough space nearby to 
reset the bin when you’re ready to turn the contents.
 
Wire bins are excellent, quick-to-construct holding units if you 
score a windfall of leaves, straw, or other dry carbon materials that 
need stockpiling until you’re ready to add them to your compost. 
This is also the perfect container for making leaf mold, a type of 
compost with leaves as the sole ingredient (see Chapter 7).
Hardware cloth isn’t cloth at all, but stiff galvanized mesh screen. 
It maintains its shape better over the long term than poultry wire 
(also called chicken wire), which has a tendency to get bent or 
crushed without support poles. Hardware cloth bins stand firmly 
upright without supports. Otherwise, the advantages and disad-
vantages of bins made of hardware cloth or poultry wire are the 
same and are listed here:
 
✓ Advantages
 
• Cost: They’re inexpensive, or even free if you have wire 
from other projects to recycle.
 
• Size: They’re good for small spaces.
 
• Ease of use: They’re easy to assemble, disassemble, and 
store (tightly rolled).
Positioning your garbage can 
to the best advantage
If your can comes with a lid but no bottom and you want to keep pests at bay, dig a 
hole about 1 foot (0.3 meters) deep and “sink” the base of the container into the soil.
If your can has no lid, no bottom, and is wider at the top, tapering towards the 
bottom, the narrowing shape makes it somewhat more difficult to aerate the 
organic matter at the bottom when stirring with a compost fork or aeration tool. 
Setting the can upside down so the wider section becomes the base alleviates this 
issue. When it’s time to turn the material, lift it up, set it aside, and fork the materials 
back into it. When choosing a site for your composting, allow sufficient space to set 
the can to the side, and you’ll save labor in the long run.

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 83
 
• Weight/portability: They’re lightweight and easy to 
move. Just pick up the empty wire circle and carry it to 
a new location in the landscape.
 
• Air circulation: They provide good aeration for rainy 
climates.
 
✓ Disadvantages
 
• Openness to pests: See Chapter 5 for ideas on inhibiting 
pests.
 
• Dryness: Organic matter dries out rapidly. Obviously 
this is the opposite of the previously mentioned advan-
tageous aeration! Especially in arid climates or windy 
weather, compost in open wire bins dries out faster than 
compost contained by more solid enclosures.
 
 You can alleviate dryness by throwing a tarp over the 
entire bin or by remoistening the organic material regu-
larly. You can also wrap the exterior sides with burlap 
or heavy, corrugated cardboard. As the cardboard starts 
to disintegrate, rip it up and toss it in the compost. 
Rewrap the enclosure with fresh cardboard. Shops and 
businesses always seem to have a plentiful supply of 
cardboard to recycle.
Materials
Here’s yet another bin style that requires just a few simple materials 
to complete your project:
 
✓ 10- to 121⁄2-foot (3- to 4-meter) length of 36-inch-wide (1-meter-
wide) hardware cloth. (Divide your total wire length by 3.14 to 
obtain the bin’s potential diameter.)
 
✓ Baling wire to use as ties.
 
✓ Wire cutters.
 
✓ Metal file.
 
✓ Optional: Pliers.
This size wire forms a bin about 3 to 3.5 feet (1 meter) in diameter 
and 3 feet (1 meter) high, holding about 1 cubic yard (1 cubic meter) 
of organic matter, a perfect amount for a pile to self-insulate and 
heat for faster decomposition (Chapter 8 discusses optimal pile 
sizes). This bin height is easy to shovel or fork materials over, as 
well as to reach into with a tool to aerate the contents.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
84
 
Hardware cloth and poultry wire are sold in rolls of various lengths 
and widths. If you plan to make only one bin, you may be able to 
buy a roll that is close to your desired bin size and skip the step 
of cutting wire. If you have leftovers from a roll of hardware cloth, 
scraps make excellent compost screens. Chapter 10 explains how 
to make and use a compost screen.
Instructions
This section walks you through the steps of creating the bin shown 
in Figure 6-2.
 
Wire that has been tightly rolled has a hidden desire to spring loose 
from the shape you’re trying to form, so an extra set of hands can 
be helpful to hold it while you tie the ends together.
 
1. Use wire cutters to cut the hardware cloth to the desired 
length.
 
 Cut flush with the cross-wires to eliminate sharp points 
that can scratch unprotected hands and arms when work-
ing with the bin.
 
2. Use a steel file to lightly smooth any rough edges that 
remain after cutting.
 
3. Form the length of wire into a cylinder.
 
4. Secure the ends of the wire cylinder together with wire ties.
 
 If the wire is stiff, using pliers to twist the wire ties securely 
is easier than using your fingers to twist them.

Poultry wire circular bin
You may know poultry wire by its other name, chicken wire. 
Whatever you call it, it makes a decent circular composting bin as 
long as you include support posts in your construction. Because 
you need to pound posts into the ground to support your poultry 
wire bin, you should test the ground first. If it’s too hard or rocky 
to pound stakes into, scout another location or consider a different 
bin design, such as the support-less hardware cloth bin in the pre-
ceding section. You can also water the ground in advance, allowing 
the water to seep in slowly for a day or two until the ground is soft 
enough to pound the posts several inches deep.
The pros and cons of poultry wire circular bins are the same as 
those for hardware cloth circular bins; you can find that informa-
tion in the preceding section.
Materials
Posts are needed to support this flexible wire bin, but otherwise 
the materials list is similar to that of the preceding project. You 
need the following:
 
✓ 10- to 121⁄2-foot (3- to 4-meter) length of 36-inch-wide (1-meter-
wide) poultry wire (also called chicken wire) or a similar 
material made from plastic, called plastic netting.
 
 If you garden in critter-dense country, note that animals can 
chomp through plastic netting.
 
✓ Baling wire to use as ties.
 
✓ Wire cutters.
 
✓ Two or three 4- to 6-foot-tall (1- to 2-meter-tall) support posts.
 
✓ Hammer or mallet.
 
✓ Optional: Pliers.
The following post materials are readily available at home improve-
ment and hardware stores. You may also find useable lengths at 
non-profit stores that stock donated home improvement goods to 
keep them out of the waste stream, such as Habitat for Humanity’s 
ReStores. (You can find a listing of ReStores in the United States and 
Canada at www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx.)
 
✓ PVC pipe: Typically used for plumbing and irrigation, PVC 
(polyvinyl chloride) lasts 15 to 20 years, although when 
exposed to sunlight it discolors with age and may become 
brittle. Even so, it should provide many years of use for your 
compost bin.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
86
 
✓ Rebar: Metal concrete reinforcing bar, commonly called rebar, 
rusts quickly but lasts indefinitely. If you don’t like rebar’s rusty 
appearance, coat it with a rust-preventing paint.
 
✓ Metal fence posts: Galvanized metal fence posts have pointed 
tips that facilitate pounding into difficult soil.
 
✓ Wooden stakes: If you have wooden stakes on hand, go ahead 
and use them. But because wood doesn’t hold up as long in 
the elements as the other materials listed, if you need to buy 
something, I suggest you opt for durability over the long haul.
Instructions
 
Wire that has been tightly rolled has a hidden desire to spring 
loose from the shape you’re trying to form, so an extra set of hands 
can be helpful to hold it while you tie the ends together.
Follow these steps to create a circular compost bin made of poul-
try wire or plastic netting and support posts:
 
1. Use wire cutters to cut the poultry wire or plastic netting 
to the desired length.
 
 Cutting poultry wire to the appropriate length leaves 
behind sharp ends, but because this wire is flexible (unlike 
hardware cloth), you can fold the entire cut side back sev-
eral inches, creating a straight, “smooth” edge.
 
2. Form the length of wire into a cylinder.
 
3. Secure the ends of the wire cylinder together with 
wire ties.
 
 If the wire is heavy and stiff, using pliers to twist the wire 
ties is easier than using your fingers.
 
4. Set the wire enclosure up in your compost area.
 
5. Space two or three posts evenly around the inside of the 
bin. Hold the posts tightly against the wire and pound 
them into the ground with a hammer or mallet.
Straw-bale bin
Straw bales can be stacked in any size and configuration to create 
a simple and relatively inexpensive bin. As an organic material, 
straw breaks down and decomposes over time, and you can eventu-
ally incorporate it into your compost pile as a carbon ingredient. 
(Chapter 7 covers details about straw and other composting 
ingredients.) Straw is a convenient choice if you’re just getting into 
composting and aren’t sure what type of bin you want. You’ll gain 

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 87
experience without paying for a bin or materials that may not suit 
your situation.
How many bales to use depends on the size of individual bales 
available in your area, how high you plan to stack them, and how 
much square footage you want for composting. Bales stacked 
in two or three layers provide sufficient area for composting, 
although you could get away with just one layer if lifting the bales 
is a challenge.
If you want to turn compost regularly, stack straw bales to form 
three sides of a square or rectangular shape, leaving the fourth 
side open for access. You can also form an enclosed square, filling 
it full of materials to decompose on their own time schedule with-
out turning. If you get the urge to turn, you can always pull out a 
couple bales to create access.
Here are the pros and cons of building a compost bin using 
straw bales:
 
✓ Advantages
 
• Speed: This type of bin is quick to build.
 
• Adaptability: It’s easy to expand (or shrink) your bin’s 
size and add adjacent bins.
 
• Insulation: Bales provide good insulation to maintain 
moisture and heat within the compost.
 
✓ Disadvantages
 
• Weight: Bales are heavy to transport and lift. If you can’t 
comfortably tote 50 to 80 pounds (23 to 36 kilograms), 
straw bales aren’t the best option!
 
• Unavailability: Bales may not be readily available, 
depending on where you live.
 
• Openness to pests: See Chapter 5 for ideas on inhibiting 
pests.
 
• Breakdown: Bales aren’t permanent, and as straw 
breaks down, it loses its tidy appearance. Stacks may 
lose their stability, sag, and look unkempt.
Materials
To create a straw bale composting bin, the only materials you need 
are five or six two-string straw bales. Based on the number of wire 
or twine lengths holding it together, a straw bale is typically sold 
as two-string or three-string. Two-string bales weigh 50 to 60 pounds 
(23 to 27 kilograms) and measure about 36 inches long x 18 inches 

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
88
wide x 14 inches high (91 x 45 x 36 centimeters). Three-string bales 
weigh 75 to 80 pounds (34 to 36 kilograms) and measure about 
42 x 23 x 16 inches (107 x 60 x 40 centimeters). I recommend that 
you use two-string bales for this project because they’re lighter in 
weight and therefore easier to maneuver than three-string bales.
Instructions
This simple structure uses five two-string bales to form three sides 
of a single-layer, open-sided bin. Its rectangular interior compost-
ing area is about 3 feet wide x 41⁄2 feet long x 14 inches high (1 
meter x 1.3 meters x 36 centimeters).
 
1. Place two bales end to end to form one side wall that 
measures 6 feet (1.8 meters) long.
 
2. Place one bale perpendicular to the first wall as the 
back wall.
 
3. Place the remaining two bales end to end to form the 
third wall.
One more bale completes the rectangle if you prefer to keep your 
compost contained in an enclosed bin. Set it against the outer 
edges of the side walls, making it easier to swing outward if you 
want to open the enclosure.
Another option for this bin is to stack another five bales for a 
second layer, increasing the height to 28 inches (71 centimeters) 
and providing you with more composting space. This design helps 
your heap self-insulate and retain more heat and moisture.
 
If you’re building your bin higher than two layers, offset bales with 
the layer below when stacking to create greater stability.
 
Use straw bales to create temporary composting sites. Surround 
the area where you want to add a garden in a year or two with 
straw bales and compost within them to improve the soil beneath. 
As the straw decomposes, work it into your compost, and as the 
compost decomposes, work it into the soil. By the time you’re 
ready to plant, you’ll be plunging your shovel into rich, dark soil 
and your “bin” will have disappeared, leaving you with nothing to 
move or store.

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 89
Stacking up concrete blocks for bins
Concrete blocks are easy to work with if you want to build a single bin and add more 
sections as your composting needs increase or more blocks become available. 
Fewer blocks are needed to build the second (or third) bin because they share a 
common wall.
If you enjoy practicing the 3 Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), you may be able to find 
free concrete blocks here and there until you accumulate enough to build your 
bin. Ask friends, neighbors, or contractors with renovation projects if they have 
leftovers. Does your town periodically offer free trash collection days when they 
accept any and all refuse, no matter how cumbersome? I’m always astounded at 
the piles of perfectly serviceable construction materials that I see dumped curbside 
in my city on those days. Put an advertisement in your local paper or on Web sites 
such as www.craigslist.org or www.freecycle.org. Many people 
donate items to anyone who will haul them away.
Level the ground where you plan to stack your concrete blocks, lay them out in your 
desired arrangement and to meet your desired bin height, and then use a hammer 
or mallet to drive metal posts through the holes in the blocks into the ground to 
provide stability. The following figure gives you an idea of how your bin may look. 
You can also easily add a second or third adjacent bin.

Wood and wire three-bin composter
A stationary wood and wire three-bin system (see Figure 6-3) is 
a style that offers a variety of advantages, including that you can 
compost large amounts of yard materials in relatively little time. 
Wire mesh sides and/or bottoms keep pests out of the bin while 
allowing the aeration needed for decomposition, and the wood 
construction blends unobtrusively for a natural appearance in 
your landscape. You can also fabricate pest-proof hinged lids from 
wood and wire or fiberglass. (A fiberglass lid maintains moisture 
within the pile or keeps out excessive rain or snow, depending on 
your conditions.)
 
Building this bin style yourself requires more carpentry skills and 
tools than other projects in this chapter, and the materials are 
more expensive than other home-built styles. You can build this 
unit for approximately $300 to $375.
This bin design and construction project is courtesy of Seattle 
Public Utilities. The overall outside dimension of the finished proj-
ect is 9 feet wide x 3 feet deep x 32 inches high (approximately 
2.7 meters x 1 meter x 0.8 meters); each bin section measures 351⁄2 
inches wide x 3 feet deep x 32 inches high (approximately 1 meter 
x 1 meter x 0.8 meters). You can downsize the design to a one- or 
two-bin system if that’s all the space you require. (Flip back to 
Chapter 5 for an overview of how adjacent bins help your compost-
ing efforts.) For instructions for building other types of composting 
bins, visit www.seattletilth.org, or use your favorite Internet 
search engine to find instructions for other designs.

Instructions
The following steps walk you through building the three-bin 
composter, starting with the dividers and finishing with the 
fiberglass lid.
 
1. Cut two 311⁄2-inch and two 36-inch pieces from each 
12-foot 2 x 4.
 
2. Butt end nail the four pieces into a 35-x-36-inch divider 
section (see Figure 6-4). Check to make sure each divider 
section is square.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for the other three divider sections.
 
4. Cut four 37-inch-long sections of hardware cloth and 
bend back the edges 1 inch. Stretch across each divider 
frame, check for squareness of the frame, and staple the 
screen tightly into place every 4 inches around the edge.
 
5. Set the dividers up parallel to one another 3 feet apart.
 
6. Measure and mark the centers of the two inside dividers.
 
7. Cut four 9-foot pieces out of the two 18-foot 2 x 4 boards.
 
8. Place two 9-foot base boards on top of the dividers and 
measure the positions for the two inside dividers.
 
9. Mark a centerline for each divider on the 9-foot 2 x 4. 
With each divider, line up the centerlines and make the 
baseboard flush against the outer edge of the divider.
Figure 6-4: Align corners to butt end nail them together.

 Chapter 6: Erecting Your Own Compost Containers 93
 
10. Drill a 1⁄2-inch hole through each junction centered 1-inch 
in from the inside edge. Secure baseboards with carriage 
bolts, but don’t tighten them yet.
 
11. Turn the unit right side up and repeat Steps 9 and 10 for 
the top 9-foot board.
 
12. Using the carpenter’s square or measuring between 
opposing corners, make sure the bin is square, and 
tighten all bolts securely.
 
13. Fasten a 9-foot-long piece of hardware cloth securely 
to the backside of the bin with staples every 4 inches 
around the frame.
 
14. Cut four 36-inch long 2 x 6s for front slat runners.
 
15. Cut two of the boards from Step 14 lengthwise to 43⁄4-
inches wide and nail them securely to the front of the 
two outside dividers and baseboard, making them flush 
on the top and outside edges.
 
 Save the remainder of the rip cut boards from this step for 
use as back runners.
 
16. Center the remaining 36-inch, full-width 2 x 6 boards on 
the front of the inside dividers flush with the top edge, 
and nail securely.
 
17. To create back runners, cut the remaining 2 x 6 into a 
34-inch long piece and then rip cut it into four equal 
pieces, 11⁄4 x 2 inches. Nail the back runner parallel to the 
front runners on the side of each divider, leaving a 1-inch 
gap for slats.
 
18. Cut all the 1 x 6-inch cedar boards into slats 311⁄4-
inches long.
 
19. Use the last 9-foot 2 x 4 for the back of the lid. Cut four 
321⁄2-inch 2 x 2s and one 9-foot 2 x 2 from it.
 
20. Lay the pieces from Step 19 on the ground in a rectangle 
and make sure they’re square. Screw in corner braces 
and T-braces on the bottom side of the frame.
 
21. Center the lid frame from Step 20 on the bin structure, 
brace side down, and attach it to the bin with the hinges.
 
22. Cut wiggle board to fit the front and back 9-foot sections 
of the lid frame.
 
23. Pre-drill the wiggle board with a 1⁄8-inch drill bit, and nail 
it to the frame with 8d casement nails.

Part II: Selecting a Home and Method for Your Compost  
94
 
24. Cut the fiberglass to fit flush with the front and back 
edges of the frame.
 
25. Overlay the fiberglass pieces at least one channel wide. 
Pre-drill the fiberglass and wiggle board for each nail hole.
 
26. Nail the fiberglass and wiggle board to the lid frame, 
nailing on top of every third corrugated hump with 
gasketed nails.
Dressing up your concrete block bins
The concrete block composting bins covered in the sidebar “Stacking up concrete 
blocks for bins” are pretty bare-bones and not much to look at. But you can take 
your concrete block unit a few steps further and make it functional and fashion-
able! Here are some ideas for making your concrete construction piece more 
pleasing to the eye:
 ✓ Purchase slightly more expensive blocks with integrated designs or terra-cotta 
colors meant to blend in with landscaping projects.
 ✓ Fill a few of the top layer of block holes with soil, toss in a few seeds, and see 
what happens. (Of course, you’ll have to monitor the plants’ water and nutrient 
needs.)
 ✓ Plant a vine at the outside base of the bin. Use a clinging vine with tendrils that 
grip the block surface on their upward climb, or attach poultry wire or a trellis 
to support growth. Be forewarned: Vines can grow like crazy and romp across 
the entire bin if you don’t keep them in check!
 ✓ Paint or stucco (or render, for my readers in the United Kingdom) the blocks to 
blend in with your home’s other architectural features.
 ✓ Tile the outside with a mosaic design or unleash your kids or grandkids to paint 
a mural on the sides. For tiny tikes, paint a giant ruler on the wall to track their 
growth.
 ✓ Hide the bin with a portable lattice screen. Lattice panels come in wood or 
plastic composite. Plastic tends to hold up better with less maintenance than 
wood in outdoor conditions.
 ✓ Attach natural reed or bamboo screening to the exterior. Screening is available 
in rolls of various lengths and widths.

rich, organic compost.
You can’t make compost without the right ingredients, so I 
describe the different organic materials to put in your 
compost as well as what to keep out of it. You come to 
understand the factors that go into constructing an effi -
cient compost pile, such as moisture content and aeration. 
Sets of step-by-step composting instructions are geared to

you discover uses for your lovely fi nished compost in 
myriad gardening and landscaping activities.

Chapter 7
Selecting Your Ingredients
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing carbon and nitrogen materials
▶ Using the carbon to nitrogen ratio
▶ Avoiding bad ingredients
▶ Finding and storing organic matter
A
ll once-living things decompose eventually, so you may 
wonder whether it really matters what goes into your com-
post heap or how much material you use. If you’re in no hurry to 
obtain useable compost, you don’t have to be too concerned about 
those issues — compost happens. But if you’re a gardener who 
wants lots of crumbly compost sooner rather than later, under-
standing the basic hows and whys of selecting carbon-rich and 
nitrogen-rich organic matter and mixing them in the right propor-
tion is invaluable.
This chapter defines the different organic materials available to put 
in your compost pile and helps you figure out the best proportions 
of each. It also covers all the stuff that should definitely stay out of 
your pile! Finally, lots of ideas on finding free ingredients (and stor-
ing them) leave you no excuses for running out of organic matter!
Getting Down with Browns: 
Carbon-Rich Ingredients
Gardeners who compost often refer to carbon-rich materials as 
browns because most of them are various shades of brown. Sugar-
rich carbon materials provide energy for microorganisms while 
they busily break down your organic matter. Carbons for the com-
post pile (in order of general availability for most folks) include 
dry leaves, woody plant trimmings, all sorts of paper products, 
straw, pine needles, and sawdust.

Part III: Compost Happens  
98
Dry leaves
Dry leaves are probably the easiest brown ingredient to work with 
for a beginning composter because they’re already smallish pieces 
of organic matter that are easy to shred into even tinier pieces if 
you choose. They’re also in abundant supply in most regions and 
turn into fairly decent finished compost (called leaf mold) all by 
themselves, without the addition of other materials. Just take a 
look at any woodland floor to see how it happens. The nearby side-
bar “When life gives you leaves, make leaf mold” tells you how to 
work with lots of leaves to create moisture-enhancing compost.
 
Shredding leaves reduces their volume, making it easier to stock-
pile large quantities to add to your compost as needed. Shred 
leaves by spreading them across the grass and running over them 
with a lawn mower. No lawn and mower? Fill a plastic garbage can 
half full of leaves and rattle a weed eater in it as a leaf shredder. 
(Be sure to wear protective eye gear.)
When life gives you leaves, 
make leaf mold
If you have lots of leaves but are low on other organic matter to mix with them, 
create leaf mold. Like compost, finished leaf mold is dark and crumbly with a pleas-
ing earthy aroma. Although leaf mold doesn’t contain as much nutritional value as 
compost for improving soil fertility, it does a good job of enhancing soil’s ability to 
retain moisture.
The process is the same as building a compost heap, minus the variety in ingredi-
ents. You decide how much labor to put in, and as with any composting effort, the 
smaller the original pieces and the more you turn and add water as needed, the 
faster the decomposition rate. It takes about 6 to 24 months to obtain leaf mold with 
either of these methods:
 ✓ Pile leaves (shredded or whole) in a heap or in a bin at least 3 cubic feet (1 
cubic meter) in size. Moisten the leaves as you work, dampening everything 
until it’s like a wrung-out sponge. Turn and remoisten (or not) periodically just 
as you would a compost heap.
 ✓ Fill a heavy-duty plastic garbage bag with shredded, moistened leaves, and tie 
the bag tightly. Make a few slits in the bag to allow airflow or it will become 
a stinky, anaerobic system. Flop the bag around frequently (or not) to mix and 
introduce air. Untie and add water as needed.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 99
The truth about toxic leaves
No matter where you garden, there seems to be at least one plant whose leaves are 
rumored to have toxic potential in the compost pile. Here’s the lowdown on several 
common concerns that pop up again and again:
 ✓ Black walnut: Black walnut trees (Juglanas nigra) produce a chemical called 
juglone that inhibits growth of some plant species in the surrounding area, 
although other plant species are tolerant of juglone. (Detailed lists of juglone-
tolerant and -intolerant plant species are available online and in many plant-
related gardening books.) Composting black walnut leaves in an actively 
managed compost pile is safe because the juglone breaks down and loses 
toxicity within 2 to 4 weeks. If you’re unconvinced, test your compost by plant-
ing a few tomato seedlings in it. Tomatoes are highly susceptible to juglone, so 
if they survive, your compost is fine! Just don’t use uncomposted black walnut 
leaves or other litter from the tree as mulch.
 ✓ Eucalyptus: Although information has been passed around for years stating 
that eucalyptus leaves are bad for compost, researchers have determined 
that there’s no evidence that plant growth is inhibited by “yuke” leaves in the 
compost. This rumor may have started because some eucalyptus species have 
aggressive roots and drop tremendous amounts of litter that make competition 
difficult for other plants.
 ✓ Oleander: All parts of this evergreen shrub (Oleander nerium) are poisonous 
and may be fatal if ingested, but there’s no proof that its toxicity hinders a 
final compost product. Researchers found that the toxin oleandrin broke down 
rapidly in the first 50 days in a compost pile and after 300 days, it was unde-
tectable. Other plant roots don’t absorb the toxin either. However, use caution 
when working with oleander material because it exudes sap that may cause 
skin and eye inflammations and allergic reactions in some people. I witnessed 
this at a composting demonstration when a young woman’s bare arms and legs 
erupted into painful red welts within minutes after she moved a pile of grass 
clippings that contained bits of oleander trimmings. Wear gloves, a dust mask, 
safety glasses, and long sleeves and pants if working with oleander. Never 
run oleander through a shredder because you could inhale microscopic bits of 
plant dust.
Woody plant trimmings
Shrubs, trees, palm fronds, dead perennial stems, Brussels sprout 
stalks, and dried cornstalks all fit into this category. Break, chop, and 
shred this material as much as possible to speed decomposition. 
(Chapter 2 describes tools that help with this.) However, if you can’t 

Part III: Compost Happens  
100
chop it really small, don’t worry; there’s nothing wrong with pulling 
partially decomposed twigs and branches from a finished compost 
pile to add to a new pile (perhaps multiple times) until they’re com-
pletely “gone.” Another use for woody materials: Spread them at the 
bottom of a pile before construction to promote aeration.
 
Get a few of your neighbors together and arrange to tackle your 
pruning chores at the same time. Pile up all your woody trimmings, 
and then convene for a shredding party. Rent a chipper/shredder 
from a tool rental store, and share the cost, labor, and results.
Paper products
Although I try to recycle as much of my paper as possible, plenty 
is still left for composting. I particularly like to use shredded 
paper for worm bin bedding, which you can find out more about 
in Chapter 10. Other paper products that are easy to shred or 
tear include used paper towels, envelopes, paperboard (unwaxed 
cereal and food boxes), paper towel and toilet tissue rolls, and 
newspaper.
Cardboard is slow to compost, and the thicker corrugated stuff is 
hard to tear, although it works well for soaking up excess moisture 
in wet ingredients. Tear it and mix it with fresh manure or grass 
clippings, or lay it on the bottom of a pile if you’re composting in a 
damp region. Check out Chapter 12 for another easy way to recycle 
cardboard’s organic content by creating rich garden soil with 
layers of cardboard and other organic materials.
 
Cardboard is easier to deal with if you leave it lying around for 
a few days when the weather is damp; then it tears easily, and 
the dampness also allows you to easily remove any packing tape 
rather than pulling all those annoying bits out of your finished 
compost later.
Straw
Made from the remaining dried stalks of cereal grains (wheat, oats, 
rye, barley) after the grain has been threshed and removed, straw 
is used primarily for livestock bedding. It’s used less frequently 
than hay as livestock feed because straw’s nutritional value and 
digestibility are low. (See the section “Hay” later in this chapter to 
compare the two.) You can use straw in the garden as mulch; it’s 
safer to use than hay because it contains few weed seeds.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 101
Pine needles
The resinous coating on needles can take a while to break down, 
so use them in limited quantity. If you have a lot of pine needles, 
you can easily stockpile them and gradually mix them in with other 
organic materials. (Pine needles also make attractive and effec-
tive mulch spread around garden beds.) Don’t worry about pine 
needles’ acidity unless you have a lot of them: Small amounts have 
minimal effect in your compost pile or soil.
Sawdust
Because sawdust has an extremely high carbon to nitrogen (or 
C:N) ratio (more about that later in the chapter), use it sparingly 
in the compost pile. Sandwich an ultra-thin layer (no more than an 
inch) between moist grass clippings, or mix handfuls thoroughly 
with lots of other ingredients.
 
Thick layers of sawdust compress into impenetrable mats, reducing 
the ability of oxygen and water to circulate through the pile. Also, 
decomposers start to work on sawdust as they do every other 
ingredient, but because of the high carbon load, they require copi-
ous amounts of nitrogen-rich material over time to process all that 
carbon. Sprinkling small amounts of sawdust you generate in your 
woodshop won’t hurt the process; dumping huge amounts from 
the local sawmill will shut it down.
Try these alternative uses if you have access to lots of sawdust:
 
✓ Spread it as mulch on pathways.
 
✓ Layer it as mulch to kill weeds.
 
✓ Stockpile it by itself in a holding area to decompose for a year 
or more. Adding it to compost piles as a carbon source then 
is safer.
Greening It Up: Nitrogen-Rich 
Ingredients
Nitrogen-rich materials are called greens because most of them are 
greenish in color. Of course, there are usually exceptions to any 
rule just to keep you on your toes. Manure and coffee grounds are 
nitrogen materials that happen to be brown. Greens provide body-
building proteins for the microorganisms crunching through your 

Part III: Compost Happens  
102
organic matter. Good green sources include kitchen scraps, grass 
clippings, leafy plant trimmings, and manure. Feathers, fur, and 
hair are other nitrogen sources to use.
Kitchen scraps
Other than items listed in the section “Knowing which Materials to 
Avoid” later in this chapter, leftovers from the kitchen are excellent 
additions to the compost pile. You do the environment a big favor 
too, because kitchen waste not only fills up scarce landfill sites, 
but it also produces methane, a greenhouse gas, as it decomposes. 
In the bargain, you also save resources needed to transport and 
process that waste by adding the following scraps to your compost:
 
✓ Coffee grounds and used filters
 
✓ Condiments and sauces
 
✓ Corncobs
 
✓ Cut flowers
 
✓ Eggshells
 
✓ Fruit pits
 
✓ Fruit rinds and cores
 
✓ Nut shells
 
✓ Shells from shellfish
 
✓ Stale or moldy bread and grain products
 
✓ Tea and tea bags
 
✓ Vegetables (raw or cooked)
 
Fruit pits, eggshells, nut shells, and shellfish shells are slow to 
decompose. Crush or grind them before adding them to your com-
post pile, in order to speed the process.
 
Some local municipalities may have restrictions on adding food 
waste to open compost bins, although covered or enclosed bins 
are usually okay. Check for restrictions in your area.
Grass clippings
If I had to pick a favorite composting ingredient, it would likely be 
grass clippings. Pre-chopped into tiny pieces by the mower and 
loaded with moisture and nitrogen, what’s not to like? Oh, I almost 

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 103
forgot: Grass clippings turn slimy and smelly if left in big piles or lay-
ered too thickly, so mix them up with brown materials as soon as 
possible or spread them out to dry for a few hours before mixing 
them into your heap.
 
If organic gardening principles are important to you, and the clip-
pings you use originate from neighbors or other sources, verify that 
the lawns weren’t treated with chemical fertilizers or herbicides.
 
If you don’t need your grass clippings for composting, grasscycling 
is an easy recycling alternative. All you have to do is let the clip-
pings lie on the lawn after mowing! Clippings decompose quickly 
and return up to 25 percent of the total nutrients your lawn 
requires, meaning you can apply 25 percent less fertilizer to your 
lawn. A mower with a mulching feature will reduce the size of grass 
clippings, speeding decomposition.
Leafy plant trimmings, spent 
flowers, herbs, and vegetables
When your garden plants have finished producing for the season, 
pull them out, chop or tear them into smaller pieces, and toss 
them into the compost pile to recycle their nitrogen content. The 
same goes for leafy trimmings from landscape shrubs and trees. If 
plants exhibit pest or disease problems, it’s better to leave them 
out of the compost mix (see “Knowing which Materials to Avoid” 
later in this chapter).
If bracken ferns have spread invasively in your garden or land-
scape, the greenery makes an excellent addition to the compost 
heap when you cut it early in the growing season. Don’t add the 
roots, though, as this tough plant can be a problem in gardens. 
However, aim to finish harvesting bracken ferns for your pile by 
early summer, as by mid to late summer the leaves have produced 
spores that can be harmful when inhaled.
Weeds — foliage only!
A healthy crop of weeds, although annoying, is a fine source of 
nitrogen. Return those nutrients to your garden where they belong 
by composting your weeds. Be sure you don’t include seed heads 
or perennial roots that may sprout.

Part III: Compost Happens  
104
Livestock manure
Chicken, cow, duck, geese, goat, horse, llama, rabbit, sheep, and 
turkey manures are safe to add to compost. Manure contains very 
small amounts of macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium) that all plants require, as well as essential micronu-
trients (trace elements), such as boron, iron, and zinc. Although 
manure adds only marginally to the overall nutrient level of your 
compost, it does provide significant organic matter and loads of 
microbial activity.
 
Depending on the animals’ diet, some manures may contain a lot 
of weed seeds, so if you’re obtaining a load of manure straight 
from the source (so to speak), inquire about the animal’s feeding 
habits. (See the later section, “Hay.”) Horse manure, in particular, 
can be loaded with seeds that pass through the animal’s digestive 
system. Unless you compost with a hot pile that reaches tempera-
tures above 131 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) for 72 
hours (see Chapter 8), seeds may survive composting and sprout, 
becoming a nuisance in the garden.
If you’re using manure directly on your garden, it must be at least 
six months old to be safe. Fresh manure, in addition to being smelly, 
contains concentrated nitrogen that may “burn” plant roots and 
tender seedlings or prevent seed germination. (Yellow dog spots 
on your lawn are a visual example of the potency of nitrogen-rich 
waste.) You can add fresh manure straight onto your compost 
heap because it’s nitrogen-rich, hot, and moisture-laden. However, 
it can throw off the workings of a compost pile if added in abun-
dant quantities. If you happen to obtain super-fresh wet manure, 
use it in the following ways:
 
✓ Let it dry out a little before adding it to your compost, and then 
blend it sparingly with a wide variety of other ingredients.
 
✓ Compost it in a pile by itself.
 
✓ Spread fresh manure across garden beds in fall, allowing it to 
rot during the winter months.
 
✓ Spread it across beds that lie fallow (that is, that aren’t used 
for growing anything) six months to one year before planting.
Digging manure into the top layer of soil promotes speedier decom-
position. Never spread fresh manure on a garden that is already 
planted, because its “heat” can kill plants. Nor do you want it 
to splash onto edible foliage. How long to wait before planting 
depends on the freshness of the manure and how quickly it decom-
poses in your climate.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 105
 
Always wear protective gear (gloves and shoes, as well as a dust 
mask if the manure is dry and dusty) when collecting or spreading 
manure. And no matter how protected you are, good hygiene is 
still absolutely essential: Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly 
and scrub under your nails after handling manure.
Manure obtained in bulk from farms, stables, and animal owners 
(as opposed to the kind you get in a plastic bag from the garden 
center) may contain more than just nitrogen-rich material. Mixed 
in may be carbon-rich bedding materials, such as straw or saw-
dust. That’s absolutely fine — it’s a compost pile in process even 
before you return home with the goods!
Pet bedding
Small pets such as hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, and gerbils are 
bedded down with newspaper, hay, and/or shavings, and this used 
bedding is a very useful addition to the compost heap.
Feathers
When I was a little kid playing softball, a teammate’s dad spread a 
layer of chicken feathers (his family raised eggs for sale) over our 
infield in late fall. Chicken feathers fluttered around in a surreal 
snowfall until real snow packed them down for the winter. I can’t 
prove that it helped my team win any games, but the following 
spring, we played on the lushest, greenest, most enviable grass of 
any team in the region.
 
If you don’t live near or have access to a poultry farm, you can 
empty any unwanted feather pillows, down comforters, or feather-
filled cushions in your home and mix in the feathers as you fill 
your compost bin.
Hair and fur
Clean your hairbrush (and Fido’s and Fluffy’s) over the compost 
bin. If you’re desperate for nitrogen, ask your friendly barber, styl-
ist, or pet groomer to save you a stash when they sweep up. Hair 
and fur can take a while to disintegrate if piles aren’t maintained to 
actively decompose.

Part III: Compost Happens  
106
Hay
Bales of hay are comprised of legumes and grasses, such as alfalfa, 
red clover, or timothy, that are grown as feed for livestock. Foliage 
is cut when still green and left to dry in the field until machines 
compress it into rectangular bales. To maintain its nutritional value 
for animals and to prevent spoilage, hay must dry uniformly and 
quickly, with limited exposure to sun and rain. Nitrogen content 
varies depending upon the plants grown (legumes like alfalfa and 
clover contain more nitrogen than grasses) and the drying process. 
A concern to consider before adding hay to your compost pile is 
its weed content.
 
Depending on where and how hay is grown and processed, it may 
contain a bumper crop of weed seeds that survive the compost 
pile to sprout in your garden. If you don’t know the source and the 
hay isn’t certified as weed-free, seek alternative forms of nitrogen 
for your compost.
Using the Right Ratio of Carbon 
to Nitrogen Ingredients
You may hear the C:N ratio bandied about in discussions among 
avid composters. As Chapter 3 describes in detail, decomposers 
that actively break down organic matter prefer a diet containing 
about 30 times the amount of carbon-rich material as nitrogen-rich 
material, or a C:N ratio of 30:1. The closer you can come to mixing 
up 3 parts carbon materials to one part nitrogen materials when 
you build your pile, the faster the decomposers will consume it 
and reward you with finished compost.
Actual carbon and nitrogen content in material varies, but typical 
ranges are included in Table 7-1. Use them as a guide to figure pro-
portions of browns and greens when you’re mixing up a batch of 
compost, but don’t stress over precision measurements. Blending 
carbon and nitrogen ingredients in the “low to middle ranges” of 
the C:N ratio (such as dry leaves and grass clippings) is a good 
starting point. Use high-carbon materials (such as cardboard and 
sawdust) sparingly. After you construct a few piles, you’ll get the 
hang of mixing up your available greens and browns in appropriate 
amounts.
 
Combine one part nitrogen materials with three parts carbon mate-
rials to achieve the 30:1 carbon to nitrogen ratio.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 107
Juicing up the process
A somewhat bewildering array of products with names like accelerators, activa-
tors, and inoculators are available for sale. Their purpose is to speed up the decom-
position process and/or enhance the finished product. Most research studies show 
that they’re unnecessary because the ingredients that are essential to achieve a 
good-quality finished product — nitrogen, carbon, water, and air — already exist 
in a well-constructed compost pile. Monikers of these products are often used 
interchangeably, but if you’re interested in experimenting, here are the products’ 
basic characteristics:
 ✓ Accelerators: They jumpstart the decomposition process by adding nitrogen in 
some form, and they may also contain bacteria, enzymes, or other ingredients.
 
 Mix a shovel or two of either local soil or finished compost from your last pile 
into your new pile for an accelerator that’s as effective as any you can buy. 
Natural materials that make excellent compost accelerators include nettles 
(the tops, not the roots) and comfrey.
 ✓ Activators: These contain nitrogen and are usually added to “activate” a pile 
that is slow to decompose. Activators that you buy are of two types: those 
derived from chemical sources, such as ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and those 
from natural sources, such as protein meals (alfalfa, blood, corn, cottonseed, 
or soybean), seaweed, or pelleted chicken manure. I don’t recommend chemi-
cal nitrogen fertilizers as activators. They don’t last long in the pile, may harm 
beneficial microorganisms and earthworms, and provide no protein, which 
microorganisms require to work and reproduce. Also, chemical fertilizers may 
become a source of water pollution if they leach out of the pile.
 
 If your pile decomposition rate slows because of a lack of nitrogen, the best 
solution is to turn it and incorporate more green materials. If you don’t have 
access to sufficient greens, go ahead and try the natural activators listed in 
the preceding paragraph. Understand, however, that this is usually a temporary 
fix, because the pile heats up quickly and then decomposition slows right back 
down if you can’t incorporate more bulky green matter to keep it running.
 
 High-nitrogen plant meals are less costly if purchased in pellet form in big bags 
from farm and feed supply stores rather than as powdered meal in small con-
tainers at the garden center. In a pinch, a bag of dried dog food (loaded with 
corn) works as an activator.
 ✓ Inoculators: Typically comprised of specific dormant bacteria, fungi, or other 
microorganisms, inoculators are supposed to speed decomposition or produce 
better-quality compost. It’s unlikely that you’ll ever need to add more critters, 
because the organic matter in your pile and the soil beneath it are already 
teeming with indigenous life forms eager to do the job.

Knowing which Materials to Avoid
Composting isn’t a free-for-all. You can’t toss in anything and 
everything you come across waste-wise and expect it to produce 
usable, healthy compost. Some materials definitely don’t qualify 
as compost ingredients because they contain pathogens, attract 
pests, or cause other problems. Save yourself hassles and head-
aches by keeping the following items out of your composting 
operation:
 
✓ Meat, bones, grease, fats, oils, or dairy products: They turn 
rancid and smelly, and attract dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, 
and rodents.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 109
 
✓ Feces: Waste from dogs, cats (including soiled cat litter), pet 
birds, pigs, and humans may contain parasites that are trans-
ferable to and infectious for humans.
 
✓ Charcoal barbecue or coal ashes: All gardeners should leave 
these alone because they contain sulfur oxides and other 
chemicals you don’t want to transfer to your garden.
 
✓ Wood ashes: Wood ashes are alkaline. If you garden where 
soils are alkaline (like much of the western and southwestern 
United States) you don’t want to increase alkalinity by adding 
ashes to your compost mix. However, if you garden where 
soils are acidic, wood ashes can be added in small amounts. 
Sprinkle handfuls throughout as you mix a pile.
 
✓ Treated wood products: Don’t add wood chips or sawdust 
from chemically treated or pressure-treated wood.
 
If you become a serious composting enthusiast who likes to 
monitor and maintain hot piles, the following three items can be 
composted. Monitoring your pile’s temperature and turning it fre-
quently are essential. (See Chapter 8 for details.) If you describe 
yourself as a laid-back, “compost happens” gardening guy or gal, 
you’re better off safe than sorry. Dispose of these problem-prone 
plant materials in the trash:
 
✓ Weeds with seed heads. You can pull weeds before they go to 
seed and toss them in your compost pile as a good source of 
nitrogen. But if seeds have set, toss the entire plant in the trash.
 
✓ Disease- or insect-infested plant material.
 
✓ Plants that spread with invasive root systems, such as African 
couch grass, Bermuda grass, bindweed, Canada thistle and 
other thistles, dock weed, morning glory, and nettle. Just a 
smidgen of this root material can survive to sprout another 
day and spread havoc throughout your garden.
 
If throwing away organic matter, no matter how weedy and 
disease-ridden, sends minor guilt pangs up and down your spine 
but you don’t have time to regularly maintain a hot pile, stockpile 
all the bad stuff in a separate bin where it can’t inadvertently be 
mixed in with the good stuff. Or place all the bad stuff in a large 
(30- to 40-gallon), black, thick plastic garbage bag and seal it. When 
the quantity is sufficient and you have plenty of green, nitrogen-
rich materials (such as grass clippings or manure) to add to it, 
build one pile to neutralize the problems. Laboring over just one 
hot heap per garden season isn’t as time-consuming as ensuring 
that every pile heats up to the red zone.
Another option is to take diseased or invasive plant material to 
your local recycling center that collects green waste. Ask if they 

Part III: Compost Happens  
110
compost at sufficiently high temperatures to destroy your problem 
plants. If they do, make your contribution; if they don’t, it’s back to 
Plan A.
Getting Your Hands on 
Compostable Materials
If you have insufficient carbon or nitrogen to whip up a good mix 
of materials, you can wait to build a compost pile until your land-
scape generates what you need, stockpiling what you do have in 
the meantime. Or, you can take charge and go on a hunt for what 
you want. You may be pleasantly surprised at the wide availability 
of materials just waiting for someone to claim them. This section 
offers tips on both stockpiling what you have and tracking down 
more, so that, in the end, you have the best compost on the block.
Stockpiling your own organic matter
Your landscape may generate significant amounts of materials at 
different times of the year. Rather than bemoaning all those fallen 
leaves that must be raked in autumn, consider them a wonderful 
abundance of carbon-rich material that you can stockpile for a year’s 
worth of composting experiments. Because dry carbon materials 
seldom, if ever, generate bad odors, they’re easy to store. You may 
want to have a separate holding unit for carbon materials, including 
leaves, straw, sawdust, and chipped plant material. Pick up curbside 
plastic bags full of leaves in your neighborhood, and pile them in an 
out-of-sight corner of the yard.
Too much of a good thing
Large quantities of high-carbon materials, such as sawdust, straw, or shredded 
newspaper, invite soil microorganisms to dive into the buffet, and the wealth of food 
allows them to reproduce in great quantities. However, their burgeoning popula-
tion also requires nitrogen for bodybuilding, so they tie up existing nitrogen in the 
soil, which is called nitrogen immobilization. After the critters perform their role, 
nitrogen will be released again as they die off.
Unfortunately, this process may negatively impact your garden in the short term 
because nitrogen is one of three essential nutrients (along with phosphorus and 
potassium) for healthy plant development. Without nitrogen, your plants may look 
stunted or yellow. If you have a load of high-carbon organic matter, stockpile it for 
gradual use, mixing small quantities into the compost pile.

 Chapter 7: Selecting Your Ingredients 111
Green, nitrogen-rich material is more problematic to stockpile 
because it usually has a high moisture content and can become 
stinky and matted or attract flies. Spread grass clippings out thinly 
to dry a bit rather than leaving them in a big pile, but try to use 
them quickly because their moisture is an advantage in the com-
post pile. A pile of fresh manure loses its odor within a couple 
weeks. Stockpile it in an out-of-the-way locale where you can plun-
der it as needed. Finally, if you find yourself with a load of green 
garden waste at the end of the season, chopping it up into com-
postable pieces when it’s fresh is easier than waiting until it dries 
out and becomes stringy and/or woody.
Rounding up free organic matter
Suppose your composting mania kicks into high gear, but your 
landscape and household can’t generate as much organic matter 
as you need. Plenty of free organic matter is in need of a good 
home! Various materials and sources include
 
✓ Free leaves: Walk around your neighborhood and see who 
puts out bags of lawn clippings or dried leaves for trash pick-
up or green waste collection. In autumn, look out for work 
crews clearing leaves from the street and collect some for 
yourself. If local pickup fees are based on volume, neighbors 
may be so delighted by your interest in composting that 
they’ll haul their bags of leaves to your house! I know an avid 
young composting family whose neighbors drop off bags 
of trimmings in their driveway on the way to work, giving a 
friendlier meaning to the term “drive-by dumping.”
 
 Express your appreciation for the free organic matter by drop-
ping off a basket of juicy tomatoes or a bouquet of fresh-cut 
flowers from your garden. Not only is it a neighborly gesture, 
but it also shows tangible results of what happened to all that 
“useless” rotting organic matter. Your contact may become a 
composting convert.
 
✓ Coffee grounds: Not only does java provide nitrogen, but used
grounds are already tiny and moisture-laden to promote speedy 
decomposition. Check with your neighborhood cafe or 24-hour 
restaurants near freeway exits. They brew umpteen pots of 
coffee to keep all those drivers awake!
 
✓ Manure: Ask local farmers, stables, and dairies. Large operations 
typically have waste management systems in place to deal 
with all that bulk, so you may be luckier with small operations 
or family farms. In urban areas, check neighborhoods known 
as horse properties, where residents have space for a few 
horses, goats, or chickens.

Part III: Compost Happens  
112
 
✓ Regional by-products: What food or fiber products are grown 
and processed in your area? Think apple mash at cider fac-
tories, hops from microbreweries, grape skins from wineries, 
and cottonseed hulls from cotton gins.
 
✓ Grocery stores and markets: Produce departments trim and 
cull fruits and vegetables daily. Their in-store delis may be a 
source of coffee grounds.
 
✓ Landscape maintenance companies: Check the Yellow Pages 
or watch your neighborhood for local companies that regu-
larly handle mowing and trimming projects. They pay fees to 
dump clippings and trimmings at the landfill. Because they 
also factor in the expense of gas, wear and tear on trucks, and 
employee time spent driving to landfills, most are delighted 
to deposit a load of organic matter in your driveway. Discuss 
the contents with them in advance if you need green grass 
clippings or brown dried leaves. Be sure you don’t get a load 
of diseased plants, poisonous oleander leaves, or thorny rose 
bush trimmings! Also, discuss the pesticide and chemical 
fertilizers used with the landscape supervisor. She may be 
able to steer the “truly organic” matter to you.
 
✓ Utilities: Electric companies trim trees beneath utility wires. 
They typically work with a heavy-duty chipper/shredder, so 
they’re an excellent source for bark chips. The downside is 
that there’s often a waiting list, and they may not schedule a 
drop far in advance.
 
✓ Local municipalities: You may be lucky to live in a commu-
nity that runs a waste-reduction project that includes drop-
off/pick-up points for organic matter. Drop off your dried 
leaves in fall and pick up a batch of compost. Such a deal! 
Check with local waste management departments, parks and 
recreation services, garden clubs, or cooperative extension 
offices to find programs in your area.
 
Place a request for organic matter on the Internet through your 
local Craigslist (www.craigslist.org) or Freecycle (www.
freecycle.org) listings. Also post fliers with your requests at 
local shops, your library, and other similar spots in your area.

Mixing Up a Batch: 
A Step-by-Step Guide
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding where to locate your compost area
▶ Mixing and maintaining a pile
▶ Figuring out when it’s done
▶ Refining your composting style
I
’m willing to bet there are as many composting techniques as 
there are gardeners, but following a few basic guidelines makes 
the process easy for beginners. (And if you prove that composting 
can be easy, you have a better chance of getting family and friends 
to join in!) This chapter ushers you through the nuts and bolts of 
placing, creating, and maintaining a compost pile. I also offer point-
ers to help you fine-tune your composting style after you have the 
basics covered.
Deciding on Location
You’ve decided to get into the composting game. Way to go! First 
you need to figure out a good location in your landscape to situ-
ate your composting efforts. I offer some practical considerations 
in this section, but only you can decide those all-important “aes-
thetic issues” if, for example, you’re dealing with folks who aren’t 
enthusiastic about rotting organic matter in their line of sight. You 
may take pride in pointing out your elegantly designed, three-bin 
composting operation to guests from the living room window, but 
if your housemate is mortified, that’s probably not a good location. 
(It could also be a sign that you’re not living with a compatible 
housemate, but that’s another book entirely!)
To be a good neighbor, take into account your neighbors’ views or 
potential concerns. Will your bins piled high with straw and fresh 

Part III: Compost Happens  
114
manure be visible from your neighbors’ patio, where they sit and 
watch birds? Also, check homeowner association or other munici-
pal regulations that may influence your options.
Choosing a convenient site
The ideal location for composting is within easy reach of a hose. 
You’ll apply water to each pile as you build, uniformly moisten-
ing all the organic matter. And if you decide to regularly turn and 
maintain your compost, you’ll be remoistening piles again and 
again. A gallon of water weighs over 8 pounds, so it’s unlikely you’ll 
want to lug sufficient water to keep your compost bins churning 
out a finished product!
 
If you have a large property and compost on the outskirts, rather 
than dragging a hose, consider extending your underground water 
line and installing a hose bib close to the action.
How much space you need depends on the ultimate scope of your 
composting operation and what style of bins, if any, you decide 
to use. (Chapter 5 helps you envision bin shapes and sizes.) At its 
most basic, a freestanding pile of organic matter (without a bin 
enclosing it) should be at least 3 feet long x 3 feet wide x 3 feet tall 
(1 meter long x 1 meter wide x 1 meter tall) — up to 5 x 5 x 5 feet 
(1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 meters), as depicted in Figure 8-1. (See the later 
section “Finding the pile size that’s just right” for more size con-
siderations.) Don’t forget to allow yourself elbow room to comfort-
ably swing a pitchfork loaded with organic matter and shovel your 
finished compost into a bucket, wheelbarrow, or cart for transport 
elsewhere in the landscape.
Ideal pile size: 3–5 cubic f
(1–1.5 cubic meters)
Figure 8-1: The optimal size for a freestanding pile is 3 to 5 cubic feet (1 to 1.5 
cubic meters).

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 115
However, don’t let lack of space deter you from composting. Even 
the smallest courtyard garden or balcony has a corner for a com-
pact compost bin design or a worm bin (see Chapter 10 for more 
on this), and good-looking bin designs are available for those who 
have nowhere to hide their composting efforts.
Because finished compost is heavy, setting up close to where the 
finished compost will be used makes sense. If you plan to add 
garden beds or planting areas in the future, compost right on top 
of those spots. Your composting effort will somewhat soften the 
top layer of soil beneath it, making it easier to dig, and nutrients 
leached from the compost pile will give a boost to new plants. 
Compost directly on the ground (not on concrete or other hard-
scape surfaces) to promote good contact with soil microorgan-
isms, aeration, and drainage.
As for other practical considerations for locating your compost 
area, think about whether you plan to add fresh organic matter 
frequently and whether you want to turn the organic matter. If 
you don’t regularly turn, water, or monitor a pile, it may be fine 
to locate it out of sight, out of mind, in the far corner of your yard 
behind a hedge or garden shed, decomposing slowly over time. 
Alternatively, if you want to recycle all your kitchen waste daily, 
adding scraps frequently is easier when the pile is close at hand.
Climate considerations
Regardless of where you live, site your compost area in the shade 
if at all possible. Shade keeps the organic matter from drying out 
rapidly. (It also keeps you from dehydrating in the sun when the 
time comes to toss a ton of organic matter.)
Wet compost turns stinky fast and is heavy to turn. If you live in a 
rainy climate, avoid places beneath eaves where downpours leach 
nutrients and create a soggy mess. Also avoid areas with poor drain-
age where rainwater puddles, forcing you to slog through mud.
If you share property with mosquitoes or those equally nasty biting 
horseflies, tending a compost area at the far edge of a property seems 
unbearable. If you want to keep your compost cooking through the 
year while avoiding biters, consider an enclosed bin near the back 
door for kitchen scraps, so you can dash in and out quickly.

Part III: Compost Happens  
116
Cold and snowy winters don’t have to stop you from adding 
ingredients to your pile. If you want to add kitchen scraps or other 
materials through the winter, situate the compost area where you 
can reach it easily — unless you like to strap on snowshoes and 
get exercise, of course! (Check out Chapter 5 for more ideas on 
what to do with kitchen waste.)
Creating Your Pile
At last, you’re ready to start piling up the goods. This section 
explains how you can speed decomposition by creating a pile of 
optimum proportions and prepping ingredients before tossing 
them on the heap. It also covers methods for enhancing airflow 
that you build into the pile while layering and moistening the com-
posting ingredients.
Finding the pile size that’s just right
For a typical backyard situation, a freestanding pile that is 3 x 3 x 
3 feet (1 cubic yard or 1 cubic meter) is both easily managed and 
efficient. It provides sufficient bulk for the organic matter to self-
insulate, creating a moist, warm interior for all the microbes to live 
and reproduce in while maintaining the heat that their activity gen-
erates. (Chapter 3 covers compost critters in detail.)
 
A pile that’s 1 cubic yard in size can heat up sufficiently to kill most 
weed seeds and plant pathogens, but only if you maintain it prop-
erly. You must create a specific pile type and maintain it rigor-
ously in order to kill weed seeds and plant diseases — the section 
“Compost for Type-A personalities” later in this chapter provides 
step-by-step instructions for this type of pile.
If you have the space and materials, you can start out by creating 
a larger pile, up to 4 or even 5 cubic feet (1.2 to 1.5 cubic meters), 
as shown in Figure 8-1. However, going larger than 5 cubic feet 
(1.5 cubic meters) doesn’t allow sufficient air circulation through 
the center of the pile, and the decomposition process slows. Plus, 
turning a bigger pile is more cumbersome. If you want to try your 
hand at large-scale composting, turn to Chapter 4.

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 117
To chop or not to chop: Adding 
small or large chunks
 
The smaller the pieces of organic matter in your compost, the 
faster the rate of decomposition.
Lots and lots of small pieces offer more surface area for micro-
organisms and macroorganisms to chomp on. It’s analogous to 
cooking up a stir-fry meal. If you slice and dice the veggies into 
bite-size pieces before tossing them into a wok, they cook faster, 
and you can enjoy dinner much sooner than if you throw a whole 
onion and head of cabbage into the pan.
Chop, break, and shred most of the material into small pieces. 
There doesn’t have to be anything tidy or uniform about it. Your 
goal is to offer as many entry wounds as possible for critters to 
attack. Incorporate these routines into your garden cleanup:
 
✓ Break thin branches over your knee or cut them into 
smaller pieces with hand pruners and loppers as you prune.
 
✓ Chop weeds with a hoe or square-bladed spade.
 
✓ Tear apart spent annuals as you pull them from the garden 
with your gloved hands.
 
✓ Set aside an area for chopping refuse with a hatchet or 
machete (an excellent stress reducer, by the way). Use 
smooth, flat ground surface or a large tree stump. Wear 
protective safety glasses when chopping.
 
✓ Consider renting or buying a chipper/shredder if you have 
lots of woody material to deal with.
 
Although most of your compost material should be small pieces, 
it’s okay — even beneficial — to allow some bulk to remain to provide 
air pockets. If all the contents of your pile are tiny, compacted bits 
(such as grass clippings, shredded leaves, wet manure, sawdust), 
they compress and form impenetrable mats, reducing the ability 
of oxygen to circulate through the pile. Composting critters need 
oxygen to thrive, and if the oxygen in the pile is depleted, they 
die without reproducing in sufficient numbers to keep the pro-
cess moving steadily along. Avoid this problem by incorporating 

Part III: Compost Happens  
118
a variety of material sizes. Mix the small materials well or spread 
them in ultra-thin layers — never thick, impenetrable layers. Aim 
to achieve a mix of “greens” (moist materials) and “browns” (dry 
ones), and you can’t go wrong!
Aerating made easy
In aerobic composting, oxygen is needed for decomposition. 
(Chapter 4 covers aerobic composting in more detail.) Decomposing 
organisms use up initial air supplies quickly. Without sufficient oxy-
gen to fuel the composting organisms (as I describe in Chapter 3), 
the process slows. Decomposition won’t screech to a complete 
halt, but it will definitely slacken. Turning the pile periodically to 
add more oxygen kicks it back into gear, as I explain in the later 
section, “Tending to the Compost Pile.”
 
If you don’t want to turn your pile frequently (or at all), don’t 
worry. Compost will still make itself, it’ll just take longer. However, 
it’ll help if you incorporate one or more of the following methods 
to promote aeration as you construct your pile:
 
✓ Start with a layer of larger, woody branch trimmings, dead 
perennial stems, or cornstalks at the bottom of the pile (this 
lets in lots of air from the base), and scatter some throughout 
the pile as you build it. This makes it a bit more difficult to 
turn the pile because large, woody chunks get stuck in 
fork tines.
 
✓ Lay a wooden shipping pallet down as the foundation of 
your compost pile. (If you garden where soil drainage is poor, 
do this in addition to incorporating trimmings as noted in the 
preceding bullet; otherwise, one or the other is sufficient.) The 
pallet sits a few inches aboveground, allowing air circulation 
beneath. Try this if achieving sufficient aeration is a problem 
because the ground remains damp or it rains a lot.
 
✓ Insert one or more airflow tubes into the midst of the pile 
during construction, adding material around them as you 
build, as shown in Figure 8-2. Make tubes from leftover lengths 
of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) drainpipe (any diameter over 
2 inches [5 centimeters] is good), chicken wire, or hardware 
cloth. Drill holes into PVC pipe every 6 inches (15 centimeters) 
or so along the length of the pipe. Or, roll chicken wire or 
hardware cloth into a cylindrical shape. Tubes should be long 
enough to reach the bottom of the pile and extend to the top of 
the bin. Airflow tubes serve double-duty because they can also 
be used to add water to the pile’s interior if it dries out.

Piling on the layers — and 
watering as you work
Do you prefer chocolate layer cake or tossed salad? When it 
comes to constructing a compost pile, you can alternate layers of 
browns and greens like a chocolate layer cake (with green frosting), 
or toss everything together like a giant chopped salad. (Turn to 
Chapter 7 for an explanation of brown and green compost ingre-
dients.) Generally, the more mixed up the ingredients, the better 
the overall decomposition, because different ingredient layers 
can decompose at different rates. But layering is usually easier 
for most folks, plus you can add layers to the pile as more ingredi-
ents become available. Layer your pile as follows, starting at the 
bottom:
 
1. 4 inches (10 centimeters) of chunky browns (sticks, 
woody trimmings, dried perennial stems, cornstalks, and 
the like) to promote aeration at the bottom
 
2. 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of other browns 
(leaves, straw, woody trimmings, paper products, pine 
needles, sawdust)

Part III: Compost Happens  
120
 
3. 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of greens (kitchen 
scraps, grass clippings, leafy plant trimmings, manure)
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you reach a pile height of 3 to 
5 feet. Finish with a top layer of browns to insulate.
 
As I mention in the earlier section “To chop or not to chop: Adding 
small or large chunks,” if you have small, compact materials, such 
as grass clippings, sawdust, or wet manure, mix them in small 
quantities with other materials, or use them in ultra-thin layers.
Whether you layer or mix your compost pile isn’t really that big of 
a deal. The more important issue is to ensure that all your recipe 
ingredients are sufficiently moist as you build. Just like humans, 
decomposing microorganisms need moisture to thrive. If the organic 
materials in your compost pile dry out — or if they’re too dry to begin 
with — the composting process is derailed. Organic materials — 
especially the carbons, such as sawdust, dried leaves, or shredded 
paper — require you to add water as you build your pile.
 
If you wait to moisten the entire compost pile from the top after 
you construct it, the water will quickly find the path of least resis-
tance to the ground, forming a puddle at the base while bypass-
ing the majority of the organic matter. Instead, use a hose with 
an on/off spray attachment, and sprinkle each layer (or every 10 
to 12 shovel- or pitchfork-loads) of organic matter as you build. 
Everything should have the moisture level of a wrung-out sponge, 
so grab a handful every once in a while as you build, and test it.
Tending to the Compost Pile
A well-constructed pile can be left to rot on its own timetable, 
rewarding you with useable compost in three to six months. If you 
want to dig out black gold faster than that, or if you didn’t have 
quite the right mix of ingredients on hand when you created your 
pile, you can speed the process by turning and remoistening the 
pile and incorporating more ingredients as needed.
Table 8-1 touches on some possible problems you may encounter 
when tending to your compost pile. For more-detailed trouble-
shooting information, turn to Chapter 14.

Turning your compost pile
Just a few days after creation, your towering mountain of compost 
will shrink noticeably. This is exactly what should be happen-
ing. The decomposers are using up oxygen, collapsing millions of 
tiny air spaces between all those bits of organic matter. Without 
oxygen, the decomposing population drops, and the decomposi-
tion process slows. To keep the process rolling — or if your goal 
is to cook up a hot pile to kill weed seeds — you must introduce a 
fresh oxygen supply by turning the organic matter. (See “Compost 
for Type-A personalities” later in this chapter for guidelines on cre-
ating and sustaining a hot pile.)
To turn a freestanding pile, simply fork the material into a new 
heap adjacent to the original one, remoistening as needed (see 
the next section for watering instructions). If you have only one 
container, fork out the material onto the ground and then back 
in, mixing as you go. The easiest option is to have an empty bin 
available so you can simply transfer your compost from one bin to 
another. Some bin styles and configurations are more labor-saving 
than others when it comes to turning frequently, such as tumblers; 
Chapter 5 describes those options in detail.
Turning the entire pile is the most effective aeration method. But 
if you can’t do that regularly, another option is to plunge an aerat-
ing tool in the midst of the organic matter. Chapter 2 explains how 
these tools work and covers the pros and cons of different styles. 
Aerating tools don’t introduce as much oxygen as completely over-
turning the entire pile, but they churn things up somewhat. Within 
the confines of smaller bins, aerating tools are usually easier to 
maneuver than shovels or forks when turning material.
Adding water
 
As you turn your pile, have the hose ready to sprinkle the material 
with water as you work. All the organic matter should be moist like 
a wrung-out sponge — just like it was when you constructed the 
pile — so grab a few handfuls of the material as you’re turning it to 
check the moisture level. And just as in the initial construction, if 
you try to remoisten the entire compost pile from the top, most of 
the water will end up in a puddle at your feet.
If you’re not going to turn but still need to moisten, sprinkle in 
small increments over a period of time, allowing the water to pene-
trate through the pile. Also, if rain is predicted when your compost 
is dry, remove any tarps, lids, or covers to take advantage of the 
free water.

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 123
When Is It Finished — And 
Why Does It Matter?
Ready-to-use compost resembles rich, dark, crumbly soil. Particles 
are fairly uniform in size, and you shouldn’t be able to recognize the 
original ingredients. (However, in a home composting endeavor, 
it’s not unusual to spy larger chunks of undecomposed materials, 
such as woody stems or clumps of matted leaves. Simply toss this 
material back into your compost area to break down further in the 
next batch.) Your compost pile should no longer be generating 
significant heat and should have reduced in size by one-third 
to one-half. Finished compost emits a pleasant, earthy aroma. 
Squeeze a handful of compost. It should feel moist, but it shouldn’t 
be so wet that it’s squishy, nor so dry that it blows away like pro-
verbial dust in the wind.
Try to restrain from raiding the compost pile until it’s finished. 
No matter how you’re using organic matter in your garden or 
landscape, finished compost is easier to work with than lumpy 
material full of corncobs, sticks, and pinecones. Nutrients in well-
decomposed organic matter are ready for plants to use. Finished 
compost’s deep color and fine texture makes attractive mulch when 
spread around plants or on top of containers (see Chapter 9). Most 
importantly, well-decomposed organic matter is safer for your 
plants.
 
If you incorporate uncomposted or partially decomposed organic 
matter into a garden shortly before planting, soil microorganisms 
continue to break the matter down, effectively competing with 
your young seedlings or plants for nutrients. Such microbial 
activity ties up available nitrogen in the soil in a process called 
nitrogen immobilization. Because nitrogen is one of three essential 
nutrients (phosphorus and potassium are the others) for healthy 
plant development, your flowers and vegetables may exhibit signs 
of stunted growth or yellowing. Organic acids in undecomposed 
materials may also harm plant roots. If you want to plant soon, 
improve the soil in gardens only with finished compost. Another 
option is to spread uncomposted matter but wait to plant. How 
long to wait depends on the organic matter and how much decom-
position still needs to take place. Figure from at least one month 
up to as long as one year for fresh manure.
Chapter 9 gives you in-depth information about where and how to 
use your finished compost in your gardens and landscaping.

Surveying Different Approaches 
to Making Compost
Composting is a great activity, in part because it’s so adaptable: 
Compost strategies exist to address all needs, schedules, and person-
ality types! This section provides instructions for a number of meth-
ods that run the gamut from very little work to regular monitoring.
Basic compost for laid-back 
gardeners
This easy recipe for a freestanding pile works well for just about 
anyone. You can also follow these instructions but layer the mate-
rial in a bin of some sort, if you choose to use a compost container. 
(I describe bins in Chapter 5.) As you gain experience, these steps 
serve as a starting point for developing your own favorite compost-
ing formula:
 
1. Spread 4 inches (10 centimeters) of chunkier, dry, brown 
materials — such as branch trimmings, corn stalks, or 
straw — as the base to promote good aeration.
 
 If unavailable, use other browns you have on hand and 
insert an airflow tube as described in the earlier section 
“Aerating made easy.” (See Chapter 7 for other possible 
ingredients.)
 
 Sprinkle all materials with water as you build. Organic 
matter should have the moisture of a wrung-out sponge.
 
2. Layer 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of additional 
brown materials, such as dry leaves or shredded paper.
 
 Moisten all materials as you work.
 
3. Toss in a few handfuls (or shovelfuls) of your native soil 
between layers as you build.
 
 It’s loaded with microorganisms ready to work.
 
4. Layer 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of green materials — 
such as grass clippings, kitchen scraps, spent garden 
annuals, or manure — on top of the browns.
 
 Moisten all materials as you work.

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 125
 
5. Continue alternating and moistening layers of browns 
and greens, ending with a layer of browns on top to insu-
late the pile.
 
 Your final pile should be a minimum of 3 cubic feet (1 cubic 
yard or 1 cubic meter), up to a maximum of 5 cubic feet 
(1.5 cubic meters). Refer to Figure 8-1.
 
6. Optional: Cover the pile with a tarp.
 
 In rainy locales, the tarp prevents the pile from getting too 
soggy. In arid regions, it prevents material from drying out.
If you do nothing further at this point, you’ll have some harvest-
able compost from the bottom and center of the pile in three to six 
months. Variations occur based on how small the pieces of organic 
matter are at the start and how long the pile retains moisture and 
aeration in your region.
Toss any chunks of organic material that don’t decompose fully 
the first time around (especially from the outside edges of the pile) 
into the next pile you construct.
 
If you turn and remoisten basic compost once or twice, you’ll have 
more compost sooner (refer to the earlier section “Tending to the 
Compost Pile”). If you enjoy turning the pile, you may want to start 
out with the recipe for speedier compost in the next section.
Speedier compost
This method requires more upfront labor chopping or shredding 
the organic matter, as well as regular turning of the pile. But you’ll 
be able to harvest more compost in a shorter time frame.
 
1. Follow the recipe for basic compost in the previous sec-
tion, but chop or shred all materials into small pieces 
before layering.
 
 After several days, the pile will shrink noticeably in size.
 
2. Turn the entire pile, making sure materials on the outer 
edges get mixed into the interior to promote even 
decomposition.
 
 Remoisten if needed.

Part III: Compost Happens  
126
 
3. If you’re gung-ho, after a week or two, turn and remoisten 
the pile.
 
 If you’re less than gung-ho and don’t want to perform any 
labor that isn’t absolutely essential, dig into the center of 
the pile with your pitchfork and check to see whether it’s 
warm and moist. If so, you can skip turning. If it feels dry or 
cool, it needs turning and watering.
 
4. Repeat the process every two or three weeks.
 
 Check the organic matter for heat and moisture, and turn 
and moisten it as needed.
After three or four turnings, you’ll have harvestable compost.
Compost for Type-A personalities
If you want compost in a hurry, a hot pile suits your style. Hot piles 
are just that: They heat up to temperatures of 120 to 170 degrees 
Fahrenheit (49 to 77 degrees Celsius) within 1 to 5 days, with 150 
degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) being a typical peak. Your 
role is to help the pile maintain high temperatures by monitoring it 
with a thermometer and turning all the material when the tempera-
ture cools. Also, you want to make sure the pile doesn’t get too 
hot (staying above 150 degrees Fahrenheit [66 degrees Celsius] for 
more than a few hours), because that much heat will kill beneficial 
microorganisms that add value to your composting process.
A well-constructed and properly managed hot pile will turn organic 
matter into compost within four weeks.
Hot piles have a few drawbacks:
 
✓ They’re labor-intensive, requiring regular monitoring and 
turning four times within one month.
 
✓ The carbon to nitrogen ratio of the ingredients is less forgiv-
ing than that of other composting methods. (See Chapter 7 for 
information on ingredients and C:N ratios.)
 
✓ All ingredients must be available at the outset to construct 
the pile.
 
✓ The ingredients must be chopped small and fine.
 
✓ The moisture level must be maintained.
 
✓ Microorganisms use up nitrogen to fuel this fast process, so 
finished compost may be lower in nitrogen content than that 
produced by other active composting methods.

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 127
Hot piles have a couple advantages, too:
 
✓ Compost is available for use faster via this method than other 
methods.
 
✓ The process kills most weed seeds and plant pathogens, allow-
ing you to recycle more organic matter onsite to keep it out 
of the waste stream. (See the sidebar “Killer compost” for 
details.)
 
✓ Maintaining a hot pile is great exercise! You’ll save a fortune 
on gym membership by turning your compost regularly as 
you work on hot composting.
To get started on your quick-decomposing piles, gather these 
materials:
 
✓ Equal parts green and brown materials, all shredded to a 
small size. Fresh grass clippings and dried shredded leaves 
work great for your first effort because they’re already 
in small pieces, and the grass clippings are full of mois-
ture. However, you can use any of the greens and browns 
described in Chapter 7, as long as you chop them into bits.
 
✓ A fork and/or shovel for turning.
 
✓ A compost thermometer. (If you don’t have a compost ther-
mometer, attach a meat thermometer to the end of a stick.)
 
✓ A tarp (optional).
 
✓ A bin (optional).
When you have everything you need to get started, follow these steps:
 
1. Chop or shred organic matter into small pieces.
 
2. Toss the greens and browns together in a well-blended 
mix (not layers).
 
3. Add a shovelful of already finished compost or native 
soil, which will be full of microorganisms to jumpstart the 
process.
 
 Sprinkle water as you build, moistening all the organic 
matter to the consistency of a wrung-out sponge.
 
 Your final pile must be at least 3 cubic feet (1 cubic meter) 
in size and no more than 5 cubic feet (1.5 cubic meters) to 
help maintain sufficient heat and moisture to speed decom-
position.

Part III: Compost Happens  
128
 
4. Optional: Cover with a burlap or other breathable tarp to 
maintain moisture.
 
5. Monitor and record your pile’s daily temperature with a 
compost thermometer.
 
 Temperatures will rise to 120 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (49 
to 77 degrees Celsius), usually within one to five days.
 
 Temperature trends are approximate and vary depending 
on the type of materials you’re composting, the size of the 
pieces, the level of moisture, and so on. Monitor the trend 
of rising and dropping temperatures, but don’t worry about 
achieving exact readings unless you need to kill weed 
seeds or plant pathogens in the pile. If that’s your goal, 
check out the nearby sidebar, “Killer compost.”
 
6. Every four to seven days, when the temperature of the 
pile cools below 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees 
Celsius), turn all of the organic matter to introduce more 
oxygen and heat it back up.
 
 Thoroughly mix materials from the pile’s exterior to the 
interior. If needed, water as you turn to maintain the 
wrung-out-sponge moisture level. Be careful not to get 
material too wet, because doing so cools off the pile.
 
7. After about 14 days, the ingredients of the organic matter 
will no longer be recognizable. Continue monitoring and 
recording daily temperatures, and repeating the turning 
process.
 
 Turn every four to five days, when the temperature 
drops below 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius). 
Remoisten if needed. Turn a total of four times throughout 
one month.
 
8. After 1 month, the pile no longer heats up after turning, 
and the bulk of it is dark, crumbly compost.
 
 The temperature drops to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 
degrees Celsius) or lower.
 
9. At this point, let the compost “cure” for one to two weeks 
before spreading around plants or adding to gardens for 
planting.

 Chapter 8: Mixing Up a Batch: A Step-by-Step Guide 129
A fine three-bin compost
The three-bin method allows your compost to age gracefully or 
be ready in a hurry, whatever your needs. It’s a great labor-saving 
system if you have space for three adjacent bins, as shown in 
Chapter 6. It’s also an efficient method for stockpiling and process-
ing large quantities of organic materials.
 
1. Load Bin 1 with organic material to start decomposing.
 
 Follow the earlier instructions for basic compost to get 
started, or use your favorite compost recipe.
Killer compost
As a practical matter, most backyard composting efforts don’t heat up sufficiently 
to kill weed seeds and pathogens. I’ve experimented with hot piles at my coopera-
tive extension demonstration site. It’s fun and a good learning experience, but also 
time-consuming. If you’re uncertain about your ability to maintain a hot pile, it’s 
better to be safe than sorry and dispose of all weed seeds or diseased plant mate-
rial in the trash. You can still have a blast experimenting with hot batches without 
worrying whether the bad stuff might end up back in your garden.
If you’re still gung-ho to try after that warning, it’s essential to monitor pile tem-
peratures to ensure they stay hot enough long enough to do the job, without heat-
ing up so much that they wipe out beneficial microorganisms and shut down your 
composting process.
Different temperature levels and time periods are required to kill different weeds 
seeds and pathogens. Follow the instructions in “Compost for Type-A personalities,” 
with these add-ons:
 ✓ Most plants diseases are neutralized if temperatures stay between 130 and 140 
degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 60 degrees Celsius) for 72 hours.
 ✓ Most weed seeds are killed if exposed to temperatures above 131 degrees 
Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) for 72 hours.
 ✓ Turn the pile multiple times to ensure that all materials on the exterior receive 
their “cooking time” on the interior. The pile must reheat to the appropriate 
range for three days each time you turn it.

Part III: Compost Happens  
130
 
2. When the materials are ready to be turned, pitchfork the 
contents into Bin 2, remoistening everything as you work.
 
 They’re usually ready within four to six weeks, but you can 
speed up or slow down the cycle to suit your needs.
 
3. Leave any large chunks of organic matter that haven’t 
broken down sufficiently in Bin 1, where you’ll begin 
adding more fresh carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials to 
start a new pile.
 
4. When the contents of Bin 2 become unrecognizable (usu-
ally in another four to six weeks), turn the contents into 
Bin 3 to decompose further into finished compost.
 
 Bin 3 also serves as a handy holding bin until you’re ready 
to use your compost.
 
5. Continue the cycle, rotating material from Bins 1 to 2 to 3.
Compost smoothie, anyone?
Some gardeners enjoy putting their kitchen scraps in a blender 
with a little water, whipping them into an unappetizing slurry, and 
then pouring the mixture into the compost pile or into holes dug in 
the garden. If this appeals to you, go for it. (Bury the slurry within 
the pile or ground to reduce potential odors or pests.)

Using Your Finished Compost
In This Chapter
▶ Using compost in myriad ways
▶ Recognizing good-quality compost
W
hether you make it or buy it, compost is a multitasking mir-
acle worker. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a first-time 
gardener or an established green thumb maintaining a landscape 
that your neighbors covet: You’re sure to benefit from at least one 
of compost’s many uses.
This chapter tells you how to put finished compost to work for 
your plants, including instructions for screening compost for use 
in certain applications. You also get recommendations on supple-
menting your homemade compost with store-bought compost if 
you find that your supply is running a bit low.
Enriching Vegetable 
and Flower Beds
A healthy garden starts with healthy soil. You don’t need to worry 
about applying miracle elixirs or wielding new-fangled tools. Adding 
compost to garden beds is the best — and easiest — thing you can 
do to produce a bumper crop of vegetables and bountiful bouquets 
of flowers. Reread that sentence and commit it to memory!
In clay soils, compost enhances drainage; in sandy soils, it 
increases water retention. No matter what your soil type, compost 
adds nutrients and improves tilth, which refers to soil’s overall 
structure and workability. Compost aerates the soil, encourages 
all sorts of beneficial microbial activity, and serves as a beacon to 
attract earthworms, Mother Nature’s soil-building contractors. The 
only negative I can think of to applying compost to the garden is 
that it isn’t a one-time event!

How much compost you need to apply and how often you should 
apply it varies, depending on the typical soil characteristics and 
whether you garden year-round. The following sections dig into 
these details.
Knowing how often to add 
compost to garden beds
New gardeners are sometimes surprised by how quickly the thick 
layer of compost they dug into their garden seems to have disap-
peared. As Chapter 3 describes, an army of soil organisms is working 
diligently to reduce organic matter to ever-smaller constituent parts.
 
As a general rule, plan on incorporating compost into your beds 
before each planting season.
When your planting season occurs and how many planting seasons 
you get each calendar year depends on geography.
One-season gardens
Apply compost once per year if you live in cooler climes, such as 
the Northeast or Midwest United States, Canada, or the United 
Kingdom, where there’s one major growing season — from late 
spring to early fall.
 
Layer partially decomposed compost on empty beds in fall before 
the ground freezes and let it decompose further through winter. 
All those lovely nutrients will be ready and waiting for your spring 
planting.
Alternatively, being cooped up inside wearing winter woolens 
while perusing seed catalogs may leave you a little stir crazy for 
some gardening activity come spring. It’s okay to incorporate com-
post in early spring rather than fall, but use finished compost, so 
nutrients are readily available for your plants.
Year-round gardens
If you live in the South or Southwest United States, where a warm 
climate offers year-round gardening, you need to add compost 
twice per year to accommodate two distinct growing seasons — 
one cool and one warm — with different annual flowers, vegeta-
bles, and herbs planted and thriving in each period.

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 133
Because the ground never freezes in warmer climates, soil 
microbes are working year-round, plowing through organic matter 
faster than their cool-country cousins. Also, some warm-climate 
gardeners work with native soils that are naturally low in organic 
matter.
 
Here’s a general schedule for applying compost where year-round 
gardening is possible:
 
✓ Cool season: The cool growing season extends from approxi-
mately mid September through April, so add compost in late 
August or early September.
 
✓ Warm season: Warm-season planting (which overlaps with 
the ongoing cool-season growth period), starts about mid 
to late February and runs through March, with warm season 
plants continuing to grow though summer. Add finished com-
post before your area’s spring planting season.
 
 Alternatively, if your garden lies empty during intense 
summer heat, spread compost and let it cover the fallow soil 
to reduce erosion, combat weeds, and maintain moisture.
 
For advice on soil improvement and optimum planting dates in 
your area, contact your county cooperative extension office in 
the United States. Every state has extension offices serving as the 
public outreach arm of the state’s land grant university. Some 
offices also offer Master Gardener programs with trained volun-
teers to answer gardening questions. Find your county office by 
searching online under “cooperative extension” and your state 
name. Or, look in the white pages’ county government listings for 
“cooperative extension” or the name of your state’s land grant 
university, such as “University of Arizona Cooperative Extension” 
or “Iowa State University Extension.” In Canada, Master Gardener 
programs are affiliated with a variety of organizations, including 
universities and public gardens. Find Master Gardeners near you 
with an Internet search.
Figuring out how much compost 
is enough on beds
If you’re starting a new garden bed, first determine whether the 
soil is organically rich. This doesn’t have to be an exact science, 
so you can use a simple “eyeball test” — light-colored soil doesn’t 

Part III: Compost Happens  
134
contain as much organic matter as dark brown or black soil. Then 
follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Soil with limited organic matter: Where soil isn’t organically 
rich, add 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of compost 
before each planting season.
 
✓ Soil with plentiful organic matter: If you garden where soil 
is organically rich, 1 to 3 inches (3 to 7 centimeters) of fresh 
compost will suffice before each season.
 
The root systems of most annual flowers and vegetables remain 
within the top 12 inches (30 centimeters) of soil. Loosening up 
your soil to that depth helps roots penetrate freely to seek mois-
ture and nutrients. Follow these recommendations for loosening 
soil and digging in compost:
 
✓ If you’re lucky to garden where soil is already loose, easy to dig 
in, and drains readily, you can layer compost on top of the soil 
and dig it in to a depth of 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) 
in one step.
 
✓ If soil is compacted, drainage is poor, or you garden above a 
layer of hardpan (impenetrable subsoil that restricts water 
movement and root growth), you’ll grow a more successful 
garden if you first dig and loosen soil to a depth of 12 inches 
(30 centimeters). Then layer your compost on top of the soil 
and turn it under to a depth of 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 
centimeters).
Over time, with continued compost additions, your garden soil will 
transform into a richer, earthier concoction than what you started 
with. How much you put on each year can vary — you be the 
judge: Were your plants healthy and productive without it? Does 
the soil retain moisture? Do plenty of earthworms tunnel about? 
If you answer “yes” to these questions, you can cut back on your 
compost applications.
Using Compost to Mulch 
Landscape Plants and Trees
Mulch is any substance spread on top of the soil to maintain con-
sistent soil moisture, inhibit weed seed germination and growth, 
and moderate soil temperatures. In hot climates, mulch keeps root 
zones cooler; in cold climates, a layer of mulch in winter helps 
insulate roots and reduces frost heave — ground upheaval caused 

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 135
by freezing and thawing of moist soil, which negatively impacts 
root systems.
Luckily for you, compost makes tremendous mulch. Organic 
mulch, such as that derived from compost, has all the usual bene-
fits in addition to supplying nutrients to the soil as it decomposes. 
On beds of permanent plants, trees, hedges, and fruit, an annual 
mulch of compost will keep your soil in good health and your 
plants in top condition.
Here are a few more advantages of compost mulch:
 
✓ Compost’s rich, dark color and crumbly uniform texture adds 
an attractive, “finished” look to planting areas.
 
✓ Compost mulch breaks down faster than bark chips or shred-
ded wood chips, releasing its nutrients more quickly for 
plants to absorb. Keep in mind that because compost mulch 
breaks down faster, it needs to be reapplied more frequently 
than wood-chip mulch, perhaps yearly.
 
✓ Compost mulch doesn’t harbor artillery fungi (Sphaerobolus 
stellatus) or other nuisance fungi found in some regional 
wood-chip mulches. Reproduction efforts of these so-called 
“shotgun” fungi involve shooting messy black or brown spores 
through the air, which are difficult to clean off buildings, cars, 
and patio surfaces.
 
✓ Birds and other wildlife are delighted by compost-rich beds 
that are also rich in worms and other creatures on which 
to feast.
 
Keep weed seeds out of your composting efforts so they don’t live 
to sprout around your landscape after you spread compost mulch. 
(See Chapter 6 for details on weed-free composting.)
Figure 9-1 shows where to spread compost mulch — around the 
base of a plant outwards to the canopy edge, always keeping it 
away from the stem or trunk because wet mulch in contact with 
plant tissue creates a hospitable environment for disease and pest 
problems. Keep pace with expanding canopies by adding more 
compost mulch as plants grow.
How thick a layer of compost mulch you need to apply varies, 
depending on climate and soil conditions. If you’re an arid-land 
gardener, apply 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) around plants. 
If you garden in cool climes, 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) is 
sufficient.

Although it was once standard practice to amend a tree or shrub’s 
planting hole backfill with compost or other organic matter, this 
is no longer recommended. For a landscape plant to develop, its 
roots must spread outwards into native surrounding soil to access 
water and nutrients and to develop a strong anchor. Researchers 
discovered that roots tend to stay cozily ensconced within 
amended planting holes. The plants effectively become rootbound, 
as if they were still confined to their nursery pot. However, if you 
are filling a border with mixed plants, dig and enrich the entire bed 
with compost before planting.
Top-Dressing Lawns
Top-dressing is applying a light scattering of compost, other mulch, 
or sometimes fertilizer, over soil surfaces to add organic matter or 
nutrients without digging it in. You can use compost to top-dress 
both new and existing lawns.
 
✓ On a seeded lawn: After sowing lawn grass seeds, apply a 
thin layer — about 1⁄4-inch (6 millimeters) — of compost as 

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 137
top-dressing to help maintain consistent soil moisture while 
seeds germinate and tender grass seedlings get established. 
Top-dressing is especially helpful in arid climates or during 
dry or breezy spells, where the soil and seeds easily dry out 
within hours. (If a germinated seed dries out, it’s a goner.)
 
✓ On an existing lawn: Top-dressing with compost may also 
rejuvenate existing lawns. Lawns often become compacted 
over time from foot traffic, play, and mowing, which prevents 
air, water, and nutrients from circulating freely through the 
turf’s root zone.
 
 Top-dressing is more effective if the turf is core aerated before 
spreading the compost. Basically, core aerating involves 
poking small holes in the top few inches of lawn to encourage 
the flow of air, water, and nutrients. To core aerate a small 
patch of turf, use a specialized foot press that you can find 
at your local home and garden store. For large lawns, rent a 
machine from an equipment supply company or hire a lawn 
maintenance firm.
 
When top-dressing with compost, you should only use screened 
compost (I explain screening in the next section) or compost with 
particle sizes of 3⁄8-inch or less. Small compost particles infiltrate 
between blades of grass more easily than large particles, which 
may smother the grass. Also, take care to top-dress with compost 
that’s guaranteed free of weed seeds, or you may be sowing a 
future weeding nightmare into your lawn!
No matter where you live, the best time to aerate and top-dress 
your lawn is when it is most actively growing. This allows the grass 
to vigorously rebound after having holes punched in it.
If you live in either a cool or “transition” climate and grow one 
permanent turfgrass (such as bluegrass or fescue), the best time 
to aerate your lawn is spring to mid-summer. Avoid aerating these 
grasses during summer’s intense heat, which may stress roots. 
Although some growth occurs in early fall, these types of grasses 
go semi- or fully dormant as weather cools, making recovery after 
a late aeration more stressful. Also, early aeration promotes better 
penetration of summer and fall rains through the soil when it’s 
most beneficial for growth. Improved soil penetration with rain-
fall creates a healthier, stronger lawn that has a better chance of 
making it through harsh winters unscathed.
If you live in a warm climate that allows year-round lawns, you 
have different options. The best time to aerate and top-dress 
is early to mid-summer when your warm-season lawn (such 

Part III: Compost Happens  
138
as Bermuda grass) is actively growing. You should also apply 
compost top-dressing (without aeration) after overseeding your 
summer lawn with a cool-season grass (such as ryegrass) in the 
fall. If you don’t overseed, there’s no need to top-dress in fall.
 
Irrigate immediately after top-dressing (unless rain does the job 
for you). Water disperses the compost evenly amongst the grass 
blades.
Screening Compost for Containers
Screening compost is simply pushing compost back and forth over 
a wire screen to remove pinecones, twigs, and other chunks of 
undecomposed material. Screening leaves you with only the finest, 
lightweight compost, with more air pockets than compressed 
garden soil. It also removes the larger seeds that survive compost-
ing and would be happy to sprout in undesirable places.
This section explains how easy it is to make and use a compost 
screen, and gives tips on using screened compost.
Making a compost screen
If you’re all thumbs when it comes to hammers and nails, you can 
buy a compost screen from garden supply catalogs. Also search 
the Internet using terms such as “soil screen” or “soil sifter.” Some 
manufactured compost bins come with screening attachments.
If you’re the do-it-yourself type, gather the following materials to 
make your own screen:
 
✓ Hardware cloth: This stiff, galvanized wire screen with small 
openings is available at hardware stores and home improve-
ment centers. The 1⁄2-inch size (1 centimeter) works well for 
compost screening; 1⁄4-inch (0.5 centimeter) will produce finer 
results.
 
✓ Scrap lumber: Scrap lumber is used to make a frame to hold 
the wire. The optimal size depends on your preference and 
the receptacle you plan to hold the screen over, such as a 
bucket, wheelbarrow, garden cart, or bin. Typical wood sizes 
for screens are 1 x 2s, 1 x 3s, or 2 x 2s.

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 139
 
 You may think: “Aha! A giant frame will allow me to produce 
enormous quantities of screened compost faster than my 
neighbor.” Keep in mind, though, that compost, like soil, is 
heavy, so take your lower back into account! A frame that 
is 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) square is easy to 
manage for most gardeners.
 
✓ Saw: If you’re purchasing lumber and are tool challenged, 
some home centers may cut the wood for you.
 
✓ Wire cutter or tin snips: Use these to cut hardware cloth.
 
✓ Heavy-duty stapler: You use this to affix the wire to the 
frame.
After you have your materials, follow these simple steps to con-
struct the screen in Figure 9-2:
 
1. Cut the lumber to your desired size, and nail the ends 
together. Make a second frame of the same size.
 
2. Cut the wire, allowing about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) 
extra to overlap all four sides of the frame for attach-
ment.
 
3. Stretch the wire tightly across the frame, and staple it 
securely to each side of the frame.
 
4. Lay the second frame over the stapled edges of the 
screen, and nail it to the first frame for a secure and long-
lasting compost screen.
Figure 9-2: Compost screen.

Screening small and large 
amounts of compost
The screening process is easy. First put on some gloves and, if you 
have allergies or respiratory issues, a face dust mask. (Chapter 3 
discusses gloves, masks, and other gear.) Spread compost over the 
screen. Push it back and forth with a shovel, trowel, or your hands. 
Finely textured, finished compost will fall through the screen. Dump 
the leftovers back into the compost pile to decompose further if 
needed, or spread them as mulch around landscape plants (refer 
to the earlier section “Using Compost to Mulch Landscape Plants 
and Trees” for instructions).
 
For small amounts of screened compost, a garden sieve held over 
a bucket may be sufficient. But rather than using your kitchen col-
ander, buy one at a thrift store or garage sale so you don’t have to 
sterilize it after use. Also, you can collect small batches of screened 
compost in plastic kitty litter or laundry detergent buckets with 
lids. Empty the containers first, of course, and then sift the compost 
directly into the bucket, secure the lid, and store until needed.
For large amounts, make or buy a compost screen that fits conve-
niently over a wheelbarrow or garden cart that’s easy for you to 
move around where you plan to use the compost. Another option 
is a screen that fits over the top of one of your existing compost 
bins. Screen sifted compost onto a tarp spread at the base of the 
bin. When you’re ready to use the screened compost, it’s easy to 
lift and transport elsewhere.
Using screened compost 
in container plantings
Only use your own compost for containers if you have cultivated 
a “hot” heap to destroy weed seeds. If you plan to mix compost into 
potting soil for containers, I suggest screening it first because growing 
media for containers should be lightweight — almost fluffy — with 
excellent drainage. Screened compost helps create that.
A top-dressing of screened compost also lends an attractive, polished 
look to highly visible container gardens, such as flower pots greet-
ing visitors by the front door and fragrant herb bowls next to patio 
chairs. After you’ve planted your containers, layer 1 inch (2.5 centi-
meters) of screened compost on top of the soil as mulch. This con-
serves soil moisture and moderates soil temperature. Throughout 
the growing season, replenish this layer as needed.

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 141
Finding Other Uses for 
Finished Compost
If you’ve distributed compost to every possible plant and con-
tainer on your property and still have plenty to spare, you may 
enjoy experimenting with a batch of compost tea or growing plants 
directly in your compost pile.
Brewing (and using) compost tea
Compost tea — made by steeping finished compost in unheated 
water — has many enthusiastic advocates for its benefits as a 
liquid fertilizer or disease fighter for plants. Interestingly, many 
of the accepted truths about compost tea are gardener testimoni-
als rather than results of scientific study. This doesn’t mean that 
compost tea users didn’t achieve desirable results (that also merit 
further study) or that compost tea shouldn’t be part of your gar-
dening endeavors. But I think it’s good to realize upfront that many 
of those fantastic claims about compost tea haven’t been backed 
up by science.
Rather than adding “brew compost tea” to your busy to-do list, you 
may decide it’s easier to use your lovely finished compost for the 
other purposes I explain in this chapter. Considerable research 
backs up those beneficial results! If you choose to make and use 
compost tea, please heed the following warning.
 
Spraying compost tea on edible food crops is not recommended 
because of the potential to spread harmful bacteria or pesticide 
residue, depending on original compost ingredients. Don’t make tea 
from finished compost that included manures of any kind. Manure 
may introduce Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, which can spread 
to humans and cause extreme illness and, in some cases, death.
You can brew compost tea aerobically (by introducing oxygen) or 
anaerobically (without oxygen). (Flip to Chapter 4 for more details 
on the differences between aerobic and anaerobic composting.) 
Aerobic steeping churns the water to introduce oxygen, which you 
can do fairly simply in a home system with an aquarium pump and 
air stone. Porous air stones are used with air pumps to diffuse a 
cascade of bubbles through water to promote aeration. You can 
purchase air stones at aquarium supply outlets. Compost tea made 
aerobically, just like compost made aerobically in a heap or bin, 
should not exude bad odors.

Part III: Compost Happens  
142
 
Steeping tea anaerobically, as I describe next, involves the fewest 
materials and the least labor, so it’s the easiest way to get your feet 
wet if you want to become a compost brewmeister. Be forewarned 
that the process and result is smelly, so you should take that into 
account when deciding where to set up your brewing station.
To mix up a batch of anaerobic compost tea, you need the following 
materials:
 
✓ Finished, screened compost (refer to the earlier section 
“Screening Compost for Containers” for instructions)
 
 When brewing, never use compost that is partially decom-
posed; it smells worse than using finished compost and may 
contain harmful bacteria.
 
✓ A burlap bag, an old pillowcase, pantyhose, or other porous 
material
 
✓ A bucket, garbage can, or other container
Here are the steps for making compost tea anaerobically:
 
1. Fill your container with water, and let it sit overnight in 
the open container to release chlorine.
 
2. Put compost in a porous bag, tie the bag securely, and 
soak it in your container of water for several days until 
the water turns dark brown, like strong tea.
 
 Use about one shovelful of finished compost per 10 to 15 
gallons (38 to 57 liters) of water.
 
3. Remove the bag of compost and empty the contents (the 
compost) around plants, or put it back into the compost 
pile.
 
4. Add water to the compost tea left in the container until 
it’s pale, like weak tea.
 
 Add water to the original container if there’s space, or pour 
the strong tea into other containers and then add plain 
water.
 
5. Use the diluted tea to water plants, or dilute the tea fur-
ther if you’re watering tender seedlings or using it as a 
foliar spray on inedible plants.

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 143
Growing plants directly on the pile
One of my favorite Arizona desert summertime gardening memories 
involves a lineup of three compost bins made of wooden shipping 
pallets (see Chapter 6) at the county cooperative extension compost 
demonstration area. Not being terribly enthused about turning tons 
of organic matter in ten different bins during Phoenix’s triple-digit 
heat, my fellow lone Master Composter volunteer and I planted 
these side-by-side bins with gourd seeds. Rambling gourd vines, 
which grow 30 feet (9 meters) long without breaking a sweat 
quickly engulfed the bins, hiding them from view. To visitors who 
didn’t realize what was supporting the vines, it looked like other-
worldly greenery in the shape of a large rectangular block.
You don’t have to be a desert dweller to try this. Simply put two or 
three plants such as cukes, melons, squash, pumpkins, or gourds 
in the center of your compost bin, water, and get out of the way!
 
If your compost concoction isn’t well decomposed, make a hole 
about the size of a bucket in the top center of the bin; fill it with 
soil, and plant in that.
Supply water and care as needed, depending on your local growing 
conditions. When the season is over and the fruits harvested, chop 
up the greenery and toss it back in the bin as a convenient supply 
of nitrogen.
Combining Homemade with 
Store-Bought Compost
Even the most dedicated composting gurus occasionally need 
more well-rotted organic matter than waits in the backyard. The 
good news for gardeners is that there’s plenty of compost for sale 
that you can mix with your homemade product. The bad news is 
that quality of store-bought compost swings widely from excellent 
to “Why did I bother transporting this stuff home?”
 
Because of its weight and transportation costs, most compost is 
made locally or regionally from organic wastes available seasonally. 
That’s great for earth-friendly sustainability. However, because 
there are no standardized testing or labeling requirements for 
compost, you need to scrutinize it before buying.

Part III: Compost Happens  
144
The following sections look at bagged and bulk compost individu-
ally, but for both types you can use the low-tech “touch and sniff” 
method to get an idea of quality. Here’s what to look for when 
purchasing compost in bags or bulk:
 
✓ Texture: It should be crumbly and fine as it runs through your 
fingers, with no recognizable materials. It’s okay to recognize 
organic matter in your home batches, but not in a purchased 
product, which signifies it wasn’t given time to decompose 
sufficiently. Watch out for bags labeled as compost that really 
contain mulch, with lots of twigs and wood chips.
 
✓ Color: Look for deep brown or almost black compost. Leave 
tan compost on the shelf.
 
✓ Moisture: Good-quality compost is moist, but not overly wet. 
Squeeze a handful. It should feel like a damp, wrung-out sponge.
 
✓ Aroma: Earthy, aromatic compost is easier to make than buy 
in plastic bags, which inhibit air circulation. But definitely 
avoid products with any unpleasant odors, such as ammonia, 
rotten eggs, or general sourness.
In terms of mixing homemade and store-bought compost, there 
aren’t any hard and fast rules to follow. If you have the time and 
energy to mix the two together before using the compost, go for it. 
But there aren’t any major benefits to be had by mixing first. Your 
plants, trees, and more shouldn’t suffer from receiving only store-
bought compost or a mixture of store-bought and homemade.
Purchasing bags of compost
Nurseries and garden centers sell compost in plastic bags. On the 
positive side, bags are convenient to transport and stockpile if you 
don’t use all the compost immediately. On the other hand, bags 
are a tad pricey if you need large quantities and, as I explain ear-
lier, the content varies widely.
If organic or sustainable gardening principles are important to you, 
look for “organic certified” or some similar statement on the bag. 
Beware: The word “organic” alone may simply be a descriptive term 
that the ingredients were once-living things. In my experience, find-
ing certified organic compost in bags is difficult. Availability may be 
a function of the type of ingredients where you live and what sus-
tainability issues are important to your local community.

 Chapter 9: Using Your Finished Compost 145
You may also want to look for the words “peat-free” on the bag. 
Many packaged composts have peat as a main ingredient, which 
is harvested from peat bogs that are a fast-dwindling natural 
resource. There are now good, reliable, peat-free composts on sale 
that won’t trouble your conscience.
 
If you plan on purchasing a lot of bags of compost, ask store 
personnel to open one bag so you can ensure the quality is what 
you expect before you haul it home.
Buying in bulk
Buying in bulk is less expensive than bags, especially if you load 
and haul it yourself. Some sellers transport it to your home for a fee. 
Ask the suppliers if they offer “dumpy bags” (an option in the United 
Kingdom, whereby compost is delivered in 1-cubic-meter bags)
that are easier to handle than a large mound piled unceremoniously 
on your driveway. In the United States, bulk producers and suppli-
ers usually price compost in dollars per cubic yard, but make sure 
you’re comparing apples to apples. (To help you visualize, 1 cubic 
yard (1 cubic meter) of compost covers 324 square feet at 1 inch 
(2.5 centimeters) thick; 2 cubic yards (2 cubic meters) of compost 
fills most standard pick-up truck beds.)
Bulk compost operators may offer a variety of grades from which 
to choose, such as screened compost, compost mixed with topsoil, 
or mulching compost. (Don’t confuse the latter with traditional 
mulch, which is chipped bark that’s not suitable for digging into 
the soil.) Screened compost is finer, more uniform in texture, and 
more expensive than other grades. If possible, go to the site and 
examine the compost to ensure you’re getting what you want.
Consider asking these questions when purchasing from a compost 
producer:
 
✓ What is it made of? Who supplied the original materials? 
Is it organic certified? Avoid materials that may have been 
sprayed with chemical pesticides, such as agricultural crops, 
or may contain some animal manure. (Chapter 7 covers issues 
related to manure use in compost.)
 
✓ How do you process it? Bulk composters can explain their 
composting method. You want to hear something such as 
“turned every two weeks for 16 weeks and aerobically pro-
cessed at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) to 

Part III: Compost Happens  
146
kill potential weed seeds and pathogens.” If their process is 
unclear, and they aren’t too sure about the original ingredi-
ents, you may want to pass up this compost to reduce the 
chance of transporting weed seeds or pathogens home!
 
✓ Do you test the end results? Bulk operators may be able to 
provide information such as moisture content, organic matter 
content, pH, salt content, and nutrient levels, including NPK 
(nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium). Look for moisture content 
in the 35 to 55 percent range, pH levels between 5.5 and 7.5, 
and salt below 5 mho/centimeter. (Mho is a unit to measure 
salt conductivity. Excessive soil salts are harmful to most 
plants, especially young seedlings.) NPK ratios are typically 
quite low for compost, so don’t be concerned about those 
numbers.

waste and adding organic matter to your garden’s soil. 
This part looks at alternatives, starting with vermicom-

worms transform your kitchen waste into plant nutrients 
and soil amendment.
You also can select and grow a cover crop or green manure, 
and then incorporate it directly into the soil to boost levels 
of organic matter and nutrients. I explain this age-old prac-

organic matter on top of your soil to decompose right where 
compost is needed — and offer an easy-to-follow method for

magine eating enough food every day to equal half your weight. 
That’s what red wiggler worms do, making them the perfect 
choice for vermicomposting.
Vermicomposting is a composting method that employs certain 
worm species to consume and convert organic matter into a useful 
soil amendment and organic fertilizer. These composting worms 
thrive in varied situations, including a simple indoor container that 
recycles your household food scraps or in sophisticated opera-
tions designed to handle school cafeteria waste or process large 
quantities of animal manure from farms.
In this chapter, I stick with the basics of an indoor household 
worm bin to recycle kitchen waste. It’s a fine composting method 
if you don’t have outdoor garden space and want to recycle your 
food scraps rather than send them to a landfill or down the gar-
bage disposal. Even if you have a garden, using a worm composter 
will enable you to recycle cooked food scraps that can’t go on a 
normal compost heap.
You’ll find everything you need to know to start an indoor vermi-
composting system, including descriptions of the worm species 
and step-by-step instructions for constructing a bin to house 
them. I explain how to feed and maintain healthy worms and offer 
troubleshooting tips. The chapter concludes with suggestions for

Vermicomposting in a Nutshell
A worm’s digestive tract extends the entire length of its body. Worm 
food passes through it to be excreted as castings — a refined term 
for worm poop. Pure castings resemble grains of black soil or coffee 
grounds. In your worm bin, castings blend with partially decomposed 
food scraps and worm bedding to form vermicompost. It has many 
benefits similar to those of “regular” compost. When added to soil, 
vermicompost improves aeration, water retention, porosity, and 
microbial activity. Vermicompost also suppresses diseases in plants 
and enhances plant growth.
To give credit where credit is due, the worms are not producing 
this great product on their own. The same types of decomposer 
microorganisms that work in an outdoor compost pile are also at 
work in a vermicomposting system. Worms consume microorgan-
isms along with bits of plant material, so they, too, end up in your 
rich vermicompost.
Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process, meaning it takes place at 
medium temperatures. (Chapter 3 covers more details on preferred 
temperature ranges of composting organisms.) Worms and their 
helper microorganisms generate temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 
degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 32 degrees Celsius). Vermicomposting 
isn’t viable in large, deep compost piles (1 cubic yard [1 cubic 
meter] or greater) that self-insulate and heat up to hot or thermo-
philic temperatures. Lots of horizontal surface area, about 8 to 12 
inches (20 to 30 centimeters) deep, works best for vermicomposting.
Vermicomposting has far more pros than cons. I admit that it may 
not be right for you if you’re not fond of worms. Also, if not well 
managed, a vermicompost bin may attract pesky vinegar flies. But 
the pros far outnumber these cons and include the following:
 
✓ It requires very little space.
 
✓ Apartment and condo dwellers can compost their food scraps.
 
✓ It reduces the amount of organic waste sent to landfills.
 
✓ It reduces trash collection fees based on volume.
 
✓ It creates a premium-quality soil amendment.
 
✓ It’s a great way to teach kids about recycling and life cycles.
 
✓ It requires very little physical labor or strength.

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 151
 
✓ It reduces water and electricity usage by eliminating the need 
to run an in-sink garbage disposal.
 
✓ It produces less odor and attracts fewer pests than scraps left 
in garbage cans.
Meet the Squirmy Stars 
of the Show
Thousands of worm species exist, but only a remarkable few 
species work effectively as vermicomposters. Don’t buy random 
worms from bait shops or even dig them up from your garden. 
They won’t be the right sort of heavy-duty consumers required to 
process kitchen waste fast and furiously.
Composting worm species
The most commonly sold worm for vermicomposting in the United 
States and Canada is the red wiggler (Eisenia fetida). Other common 
names it answers to include brandling worm, manure worm, or red-
worm. Another composting worm less commonly available is Eisenia 
andreii, sometimes called the tiger worm. In the United Kingdom, 
composting worms are sometimes sold as a “mix” with two or three 
species. Throughout this chapter, I refer to red wigglers because 
they’re the most common choice for vermicomposting.
In nature, red wigglers thrive in such delightfully rich and moist 
living environments as farm animal manure patties or decomposing 
plant debris beneath fallen logs. They don’t tunnel into deep or 
permanent burrows in the ground, preferring to hang out close to 
the surface where the really good rotten stuff is readily available. 
Because of their proficiency at consuming lots of organic matter 
and their preference for shallow living quarters, they’re well suited 
to life in shallow, household vermicomposting systems. (See 
“Hooking Up the Housing and Bedding” later in this chapter for 
details.)
Obtaining composting worms
Buy from worm suppliers who label their products by genus and 
species (such as Eisenia fetida), rather than common names, which 
vary from place to place. You don’t want to go home with worms 
that aren’t suited to the task or with potentially invasive species.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
152
 
Concern exists that non-native worm species, such as Lumbricus 
rubellus, a European red worm sometimes used for composting, may 
be invading North American forests and consuming leaf litter so 
rapidly that they’re changing the nutrient cycles. Numerous plant 
and animal species rely on a typical thick mat of organic matter 
that decays slowly over many years. When the organic matter is 
consumed quickly and disappears, so does the lifeblood of the eco-
system. Even if you carefully pick out live worms before spreading 
vermicompost in your garden, it’s likely to have a few cocoons with 
babies ready to hatch and go on walkabout. Obtain your composting 
worms labeled by genus and species and check with local experts 
for concerns about invasive species in your area.
 
Ask friends and co-workers for someone who already has a vermi-
compost bin. Happy red wigglers in their favored environment 
reproduce regularly. Most successful vermicomposters are 
delighted to “thin their herd” because overpopulation creates 
problems, as it does for any other species.
Worms are typically sold by the pound in the United States and 
Canada. In the United Kingdom, they’re sold by the kilo, or frac-
tions thereof. One pound averages about 1,000 worms, although 
the actual count varies depending on the relative size and age of 
individuals. A pound of worms is more than plenty for most house-
holds to get started.
Hooking Up the Housing 
and Bedding
Wild composting worms live in Mother Nature’s top layers of soil 
and leaf litter. They don’t thrive deep in the ground, as some other 
worm species do. In your home vermicomposting system, all you 
have to do is duplicate their preferred shallow living conditions 
with a bin that offers lots of surface area (rather than great depth) 
and keep it loaded with moist bedding.
How much room do 
your worms need?
How big of a bin you need (and how many worms to put in it) 
depends on how much kitchen waste you have to process. Review 
the list of acceptable worm food later in the chapter and estimate 

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 153
the weight of worm food your household generates. Weighing your 
kitchen scraps for a week to get a rough idea is helpful.
These points help you estimate your bin size:
 
✓ Composting worms work well in depths of 8 to 12 inches (20 
to 30 centimeters).
 
✓ Provide 1 square foot (0.3 square meter) of surface area for 
each pound of garbage to be composted. For two people, a bin 
that is 2 feet long by 2 feet wide by 8 inches deep (60 x 60 x 20 
centimeters) is generally adequate.
 
✓ Plan on worms consuming about half their weight per day: 1 
pound (0.5 kilogram) of worms eats 1⁄2 pound (0.2 kilogram) 
of scraps; 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of worms eat 1 pound (0.5 
kilogram) of scraps, and so on. They may eat more than this, 
but err on the side of caution so as to not overwhelm your bin 
residents and create problems.
 
 With a brand new vermicomposting endeavor, it may take 
your worms a few days or even weeks to get up to speed, so 
be careful not to overfeed them. It’s easy to add more scraps 
if they’re plowing through your initial offerings, but it’s not 
much fun to remove excess scraps or deal with the problems 
that an overload can cause, such as odors or vinegar flies.
Building your own worm abode
In my experience, as long as they have appropriate aeration, mois-
ture, and food, worms aren’t concerned about where they eat and 
poop. Bin aesthetics is a human requirement!
 
If you’re interested in constructing a home for your worms instead 
of buying one, I suggest starting out with a simple and inexpensive 
plastic storage bin or bins. They’re available in numerous sizes 
and shapes that will suit your worms just fine — you can even 
reuse ones that you already have. Plastic storage bins allow you 
to decide whether vermicomposting suits your household with a 
minimal investment of time and money.
The double-decker design shown in Figure 10-1 includes a built-in 
method for harvesting vermicompost. If you prefer to get your feet 
wet with just one bin, follow the basic drilling instructions for the 
double-decker bin, substituting one bin. (You still need two lids: 
one for a lid and one for a drip tray.)

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
154
Holes for aeration
Figure 10-1: Double-decker vermicomposting bins.
The materials for the double-decker worm bin include
 
✓ 2 plastic storage containers with lids. Bins should be dark and 
opaque, because worms can’t tolerate light.
 
✓ A drill with 1⁄4-inch (6.35 millimeter) and 1⁄16-inch (1.58 
millimeter) bits.
 
✓ 2 bricks to set bin above floor level.
Construct your bin by following these steps:
 
1. Using the 1⁄4-inch (6.35 millimeter) drill bit, make 20 holes 
evenly spaced in the bottom of each bin.
 
 These holes allow drainage so conditions won’t become 
too wet, and they promote aeration, which is essential to 
an aerobic composting environment. When it’s time to 
harvest castings, your worms will travel through the holes 
from one bin into the other (see Step 5.)
 
2. Using the 1⁄16-inch (1.58 millimeter) bit, drill smaller aeration 
holes every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) on each 
side of each bin near the top edge.

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 155
 
3. Using the 1⁄16-inch (1.58 millimeter) bit, drill about 30 small 
holes in the top of one of the lids to allow for aeration.
 
 Leave the second lid without holes to act as a tray to catch 
drips.
 
4. Set the drip tray on the floor. Position the two bricks on 
the tray to provide good balance when one full bin is set 
on top.
 
 Raising the worm bin several inches off the floor with 
bricks promotes air flow beneath it.
 
5. Add the second bin when you’re ready to harvest fin-
ished vermicompost (see the section “Slow harvest 
method” later in the chapter for instructions).
Opting for a manufactured worm bin
Increased interest in vermicomposting is mirrored by an increase 
in the variety of manufactured worm bins available in recent years. 
You can find them at garden stores or order them through garden 
catalogs and online retailers, such as the National Gardening 
Association, www.garden.org, or Peaceful Valley Farm & Garden 
Supply, www.groworganic.com.
Obviously, a manufactured bin will cost you a bit more than recy-
cling a free plastic storage container (see the preceding section for 
instructions). Bins can range in price from $50 to $175.
 
In their natural environment, composting worms live at or near the 
soil surface. They don’t dive deep into the ground, so lots of shallow 
surface area is more important than a deep container. That’s why 
most manufactured worm bins are made with some style of mul-
tiple, shallow stacking shelves. They offer increased surface area 
within the unit’s overall relatively small footprint.
Follow the earlier suggestions under “Building your own worm abode” 
for estimating the amount of your kitchen scraps and the number 
of worms you’ll need to consume it. Compare that to the manufac-
turer’s specifications for how many worms a given product houses 
or how much kitchen waste it will hold to find the most suitable size.
Stacked designs allow worms to do what comes naturally: move 
upwards to seek food. Start worms with bedding and food in the 
bottom tray. After they finish decomposing that section, offer food 
and bedding in the next tray, and up they’ll go, leaving vermicom-
post behind to cure until you harvest it.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
156
 
Some worm bins have spigots to drain liquid. However, liquid that
leaks from the bottom of a worm bin is not vermicompost tea. It’s 
leachate, or excess liquid that flows through organic matter. 
Because it’s an extract of undigested materials, it may contain 
pathogens harmful to plants. True vermicompost tea is made by 
steeping finished (digested) vermicompost in water.
Making the bed
Provide moist bedding at all times for your worms to romp around 
in while they process your organic matter. They have no lungs or 
gills and breathe through their skin, which they coat with mucous. 
Dissolved oxygen passes through their skin into the bloodstream. 
Worms must live in moist, humid surroundings because if their 
skin dries out, they die.
Over time, worms consume their bedding along with your food 
scraps, but that’s okay. By then, you’ll be ready to harvest castings 
and provide fresh bedding.
Making bedding for your worms requires only two materials: two 
handfuls of native soil and newspaper or computer paper. You 
may also use leaves and shredded cardboard for bedding, either 
in place of paper or in addition to it. I prefer newspaper because 
there’s always plenty of it around to be recycled, and it’s easy to 
work with.
Follow these steps to make your worms the sort of bedding they’ll 
never want to leave:
 
1. Wash bins thoroughly before adding bedding and worms.
 
2. Tear paper into 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) strips.
 
 Fill one side of your sink with water. Soak the paper in it. 
Lift it out and let excess water drain in the other side of the 
sink. Don’t squeeze the paper because then it will dry into 
hard chunks.
 
3. Lightly place the paper in the bin.
 
 Composting worms work in 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cen-
timeters) of bedding depth. Fill the bin at least 12 inches 
(30 centimeters) deep because the bedding will settle a 
bit. Fluff up the bedding so that it’s loose, with air pockets, 
rather than compacted.
 
4. Sprinkle two handfuls of your native soil into the bedding.
 
 This provides grit for the worms’ digestive process and 
adds microorganisms to aid with decomposition.

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 157
 
5. Bury one handful of food scraps in the bedding.
 
 Don’t overwhelm red wigglers with too much food in the 
first week while they’re getting acclimated. When these scraps 
are gone, add more, gradually working up to greater quanti-
ties. (The next section explains what worms like to eat.)
Introducing worms to their new home
Place your red wigglers on top of the moist bedding and they’ll 
begin disappearing into it. If they seem slow to go, shine a bright 
light above the bin. They should dive for the dark depths.
Chow Time! Feeding Your Worms
Vermicomposting worms in your indoor bin eat the same organic 
goodies that you add to an outdoor compost pile, including spent 
garden plants, landscape trimmings, scrap paper, and kitchen 
scraps. However, I assume that you’ll feed them kitchen scraps.
Mentally divide your bin into “zones,” and bury food scraps in 
different sections of the bin with each feeding.
 
Plan on feeding your worms about half their weight in food scraps 
per day. When starting a new bin, offer just a handful of food until 
they get acclimated and start digging into your provisions. As a 
general guideline, feed your worms when the majority of the 
previous food has disappeared.
What’s on the menu
The more variety in ingredients, the better the vermicompost. Try 
not to overload your worm bin with fruit and vegetable skins, which 
may attract vinegar flies. Also, avoid lots of salty food waste, 
which will dry out the poor little worms. Everything in moderation!
Worms are known to have food preferences (really), so experiment 
to see what your red wigglers prefer. Here’s a hint: sweet mushy 
stuff like melon, pumpkin, and squash is popular at my house. 
Other good additions include
 
✓ Raw or cooked vegetables
 
✓ Coffee grounds and filters
 
✓ Tea and paper tea bags

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
158
 
✓ Stale bread and grain products
 
✓ Ground-up eggshells
 
✓ Fruit rinds and cores
 
 Add citrus in very small amounts so the bin doesn’t become 
too acidic. (See the section “pH levels” later in the chapter for 
more details.)
 
Put apple cores in your worm bin. They will soon have worms 
sticking out of them, just like the drawings in children’s books. 
Kids think this is a hoot!
Just as there are items that shouldn’t be added to a regular com-
post pile, the following items aren’t appropriate worm food:
 
✓ Meat, fish, or dairy: These foodstuffs may turn rancid and 
smelly as they decompose, as well as attract undesirables 
such as houseflies or vinegar flies (also called fruit flies).
 
✓ Greases and oils: Worms breathe through their skin. Oils and 
grease coat their skin and prevent them from breathing.
 
✓ Pet or human waste: It may contain pathogens that are 
transmitted to humans.
To chop or not to chop (again)
Chopping scraps into 2- to 4-inch (5- to 10-centimeter) bits speeds 
the decomposition process in your vermicomposting bin, just as it 
does in your outdoor compost pile. However, it isn’t always essen-
tial if you’re in a hurry and your bin has been functioning well. 
Worms can execute with impressive alacrity on large chunks of 
food waste. I once plunked a flavorless half cantaloupe into my bin 
upside down without chopping — seedy pulp, flesh, rind, and all. 
Within two days, my Wormingtons stripped it down to a paper-thin 
sheet of rind that displayed a delicate ribbed pattern when I held it 
up to the light. Efficient little critters, those red wigglers.
Maintaining Your Worms’ 
Comfort Zone
In addition to bedding and food, worms need appropriate tempera-
ture, moisture, oxygen, and pH levels to thrive. And they don’t like 
the lights left on!

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 159
Light
Worms don’t have eyes, but they’re still extremely sensitive to light 
and move away from bright light if they can. If exposed to bright 
light for an hour, some worms become paralyzed. Unable to move 
away, they dry out and die. Put your bin in a dark location, keep a lid 
on it, or throw a towel or other covering over it to block light.
Temperature
The optimal temperature range for red wigglers is from 55 to 77 
degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 25 degrees Celsius). You can stretch 
those limits from 50 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 29 degrees 
Celsius), but they may not process as much organic matter or 
reproduce as vigorously.
Moisture
Maintaining moist bedding is crucial. Worm bedding should be 60 
to 85 percent moisture. Depending on what types of food scraps 
you supply, the bedding may remain moist. But I’ve always had to 
add moisture by misting with a water spray bottle or sprinkling 
drops of water across the bed periodically.
On the other hand, don’t let the bin become a swamp. Wet condi-
tions turn the bin into a smelly anaerobic composting system. (If 
you read Chapter 4, you know that anaerobic composting is stinky!)
 
Worms must remain in a moist, humid environment at all times, or 
they will die.
Breathing room
Red wigglers need oxygen to maintain their household as an aero-
bic (with air), sweet-smelling system. Be careful not to allow bed-
ding to become too wet or to add too much food at once, which 
may deplete oxygen levels. Once a week or so, aerate the bedding 
by gently fluffing it up. If you’re squeamish about worms, wear 
rubber gloves or use a big plastic spoon or spatula to gently lift 
and turn.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
160
pH levels
pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity on a scale from 1 to 14. 
Acidic is 1 to 6; alkaline is 8 to 14; 7 is neutral. In nature, worms 
survive in a range of pH levels, but in the small space of your bin, 
it’s best to keep pH in the range of 6.8 to 7.2.
Does that mean you have to measure pH levels? Not unless you 
want to. I never measure the pH level in a worm bin. I mention it in 
case you experience problems and more obvious troubleshooting 
methods don’t correct them. The following food adjustments can 
help you maintain pH levels that don’t jump out of whack:
 
✓ Limit the amount of citrus scraps to prevent the bin from 
getting too acidic.
 
✓ Add crushed eggshells to lower acidity.
 
✓ Limit the amount of nitrogen-rich materials that rapidly 
decompose, such as an abundance of coffee grounds. 
Nitrogen materials release ammonia and increase pH levels.
If you’re interested in testing the pH of your worm bin, garden 
stores and online retailers sell various styles of simple pH test-
ing kits, such as a paper strips, capsules, or meters. Although not 
always extremely precise, they’ll provide you with a troubleshoot-
ing guide.
Tackling Problems with 
Your Worm Bin
If you follow the guidelines in this chapter, your vermicomposting 
efforts should be successful. But just in case you encounter prob-
lems, Table 10-1 and the following sections address a few issues 
that sometimes crop up.
Table 10-1 
Troubleshooting Problems in Worm Bins
Worm Bin Problem
Probable Cause
Vinegar flies
Food scraps exposed; overfeeding, 
especially citrus fruit
Bad odors
Food scraps exposed; bedding too 
wet; insufficient aeration; overfeeding

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 161
Worm Bin Problem
Probable Cause
Worms crawling away or dying
Bedding too wet or dry; insufficient 
food or aeration; temperatures too 
hot or cold; conditions too acidic or 
salty
Water collecting in bin
Poor drainage or ventilation; food 
scraps too watery
Mold forming
Conditions too acidic
Bedding drying out
Too much ventilation
Odor
Most likely the bedding is too wet and compacted and your aerobic 
(with air) vermicomposting operation has turned anaerobic 
(without air). Chapter 4 describes the anaerobic decomposers as 
the microorganisms who give off stinky gas as a byproduct of their 
exertions. If conditions aren’t too bad, you may be able to blend in 
dry bedding to soak up excess moisture. If the bedding is a black, 
icky mess, salvage the worms, clean the bin, and start anew with 
fresh bedding.
Mites
As Chapter 3 describes, mites are part of the vast network of 
decomposer organisms, and small populations of mites are common 
in vermicomposting systems. However, if mite populations leap out 
of control, they can become hazardous to your worms’ health. The 
best way to avoid a mite problem is to take good care of the worm 
bin, providing appropriate aeration, moisture, and food. Overly 
wet beds, an overabundance of food, and foods with high moisture 
content all favor mites.
Dying worms
Worm bodies are composed mostly of water. When worms die nat-
urally, you’re unlikely to notice any worm carcasses because they 
decompose so quickly. However, if you see lots of dead worms all at 
once, it’s time to investigate the cause. It’s probably best to harvest 
healthy worms, wash out the bin, and start with fresh bedding.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
162
What Worms Contribute to Your 
Compost: The Casting Call
Castings are the materials that have traveled through the worms’ 
digestive systems and come out the other end as excrement. 
Castings resemble dark bits of soil or coffee grounds. Incorporated 
with the castings will be bits of bedding and food scraps that are 
more or less decomposed, worms, and maybe worm cocoons hold-
ing babies. The entire mix is referred to as vermicompost.
Just as your outdoor compost pile shrinks in size over time, so 
does the worms’ bedding. It becomes darker in color, unrecogniz-
able as its original substance, and more “compost-like.” Castings 
also amass in the bin, which creates a toxic environment for the 
red wigglers. Think about it. They’re living in poop. That can’t go 
on indefinitely, so it’s important for you to harvest the vermicom-
post and prepare fresh bedding.
As a guideline, change the bedding and harvest castings every four 
to six months. Your bin may last for six months without harvesting, 
but when you’re first gaining experience, monitor your bin for signs 
that life is stressful, such as the worm population diminishing, food 
disappearing less quickly, or an absence of cocoons with babies on 
the way. If those conditions exist, it’s time to harvest your vermi-
compost (see the next section) and provide fresh bedding.
Harvesting vermicompost
In this section I give you two methods for harvesting vermicompost. 
One method is based on the worms’ desire to eat; the other takes 
advantage of their dislike of bright light.
 
When harvesting vermicompost, you may notice shiny, yellowish to 
light brown structures shaped like 1⁄8-inch-long grape seeds, with 
one pointy end and the other round. These are worm cocoons, 
holding 2 to 20 baby worms each. Transfer cocoons to the fresh 
bin with the worms.
Slow harvest method
This method of harvesting vermicompost is more passive on your 
part than the quick harvest method I cover in the next section. 
Here, you basically wait for the worms to move toward the food 
(kind of like party guests moving toward a buffet table!). If you 

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 163
buy or make a tiered bin like the one in Figure 10-1, the worms will 
move from bottom levels upwards to consume fresh supplies of 
food, and you’ll be able to simply empty out the finished compost 
in the lowest tier.
Follow these steps for the slow harvest method using your double-
decker bins as shown in Figure 10-1:
 
1. When you’re ready to harvest castings from the first bin, 
place fresh moist bedding material in the second bin.
 
2. Remove the lid from the first bin, and set the fresh bin 
directly on the vermicompost surface of the first bin. Put 
the lid on the fresh bin.
 
3. Bury all new food scraps in the fresh bin. Gradually, most 
worms will relocate to the fresh bin in search of food 
because it’s their nature to head to the surface to feed. 
This may take two to four weeks (or maybe longer). Poke 
around in the bins periodically to monitor their activity.
 
4. After most worms have made the move, harvest vermi-
compost from the first bin.
 
5. Remove any leftover worms and put them in the 
second bin.
If you choose to vermicompost with a single bin, the same prin-
ciple of harvesting applies: Worms head for the chow line, so put 
food scraps on one side of the bin. After they’ve traveled over to 
that side, harvest the vacated vermicompost, and repeat the pro-
cess on the other side.
Quick harvest method
With the quick harvest method, you, umm, encourage your worms 
to get a move on by dumping them out of their bin and into the 
light. Their natural aversion to light works in your favor. Follow 
these steps to use the quick method of harvesting vermicompost:
 
1. Spread a plastic tarp or old shower curtain where it can 
stay conveniently for several hours in bright light — 
either sunlight or artificial light.
 
2. Dump the entire contents of your bin onto the tarp in a 
pyramid-shaped pile (wide at the base, peaked at the top).
 
 Worms at the top and outer edges begin diving into the 
compost depths to get away from the light.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
164
 
3. While waiting for the worms to get a move on, refill their 
bin with fresh, moist bedding (see the earlier section 
“Making the bed” for bedding instructions). Bury about 
half the food scraps you normally supply.
 
 The upheaval of a move is stressful, so allow them time to 
adjust rather than overfeeding.
 
4. After 15 to 30 minutes, gently scrape off the top layers of 
vermicompost, which should be mostly worm-free.
 
 Pick out any stragglers, and move them to the fresh bin. 
Reshape the pyramid. Wait for more worms to dive into the 
depths.
 
5. Repeat this process as many times as needed, until you 
reach the base of the pyramid.
 
 At this point, it will be mostly a mass of red wigglers, which 
you can pick up and transfer to the fresh bin.
 
Remember worm bodies must stay moist so they can breathe, or 
they will die. Be sure you don’t forget about them in harsh light. 
Set your watch or kitchen timer to ring every 15 minutes. If har-
vesting outdoors, monitor the pile to fend off any plundering birds.
Observing worms at work
My first worm bin was a homemade wooden box with one Plexiglas side so the 
Wormingtons could be observed when their little bodies were pressed up against 
the glass.
The Plexiglas “viewing station,” although interesting, was only marginally effective 
for showcasing the worms during composting workshops because as soon as I 
removed the cloth that kept the bin in the dark, the worms disappeared lickety-split 
into the depths of their bedding. You’d think they were being hunted by hungry 
robins rather living a life of luxury where all they had to do was occasionally let 
interested people stare at them.
Viewing worms often causes great excitement among kids and starts them down a 
path of natural discovery. If you decide to create a viewing room for your budding 
vermicomposters, remember that worms can’t stand light and will die if overex-
posed. Be sure to keep the bin in a dark place or cover it with something that blocks 
all light.

 Chapter 10: Working with Worms 165
Using vermicompost
Rich vermicompost is much desired by savvy gardeners and plant 
growers. Although actual nutrient content of vermicompost varies 
depending on the types of food and bedding that the worms eat, 
tests show that vermicompost contains 5 to 11 times more cal-
cium, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than plain 
soil. All those nutrients contribute to healthy plant growth.
Castings provide beneficial microbial activity that combats plant 
disease, and they contain growth hormones that promote seed 
germination. Castings are lightweight, almost spongy. When added 
to soil as an amendment, castings improve aeration and water-
holding capacity.
Vermicompost can be applied in the same ways you use finished 
compost from a typical outdoor composting system, such as 
mulching around plants, top-dressing lawns, or mixing it into 
flower and vegetable beds. If initial quantities are limited, use your 
vermicompost to top-dress your favorite houseplants or put it to 
use where you can maximize its benefits, such as adding it to soil 
mix for container plants. Remove any worms or cocoons, because 
the living conditions in pots aren’t suited for them.

espite their name, cover crops aren’t grown to harvest for 
human or animal consumption like other crops. Instead, 
they’re planted to protect the soil and improve its quality. If you’re 
just getting underway with composting efforts or you don’t have 
sufficient organic matter to generate compost to meet all your gar-
dening needs, consider planting a cover crop as a way to improve 
the soil or to produce composting ingredients.
In this chapter, I define the slight difference between a cover 
crop and its green manure cousin, and then I cover the numerous 
benefits that they offer to enhance your soil-building endeavors. 
Ultimately, they lead you to a healthier, more productive garden, 
providing the same perks you’d achieve by adding compost. I also 
give recommendations on what and when to plant by geographic 
region, and I include directions for incorporating the crops into 
your soil, basically allowing them to compost in place.
Recognizing the Value of Cover 
Crops and Green Manures
Cover crop and green manure are terms that often are used inter-
changeably. Indeed, the same plant choices are grown for either 
purpose, and they provide similar, long lists of improvements to 
your soil. To simplify matters, I use the term “cover crop” throughout 

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons

this chapter, but here’s an explanation of their slightly 
different usages:
 
✓ Cover crops are typically sown to prevent soil erosion and 
inhibit weed growth when a garden area is left unplanted 
during its dormant season. “Covering” the soil with vegetation 
reduces erosion from wind, rainfall, and snowmelt. Crop roots 
also hang onto soil particles, holding valuable topsoil in place.
 
✓ Green manures are typically sown to increase nitrogen avail-
ability and add organic matter to the soil during the growing 
season.
Although those slight differences in definition exist, in practice, 
the same plant species may be grown as a cover crop or a green 
manure. In the remainder of this section, I describe the numerous 
benefits cover crops bring to your composting and soil-building 
activities.
Preventing erosion
It may happen more gradually than you take note of it, but the 
combination of wind and runoff from rain and snowmelt gradually 
erodes your garden’s topsoil — which harbors essential nutrients 
and organic matter. A cover crop’s aboveground foliage buffers soil 
against the relentless ravages of wind and water, while underground 
roots do their part to reduce erosion by holding soil particles in place. 
Because climate change is bringing more severe weather conditions, 
you can help prevent soil erosion by planting a cover crop when 
your garden lies fallow during its dormant season.
Adding organic matter
Organic matter improves soil structure and fertility. Chapter 3 
describes the ongoing work of billions of organisms decomposing 
organic matter in your compost pile. Those same creatures are 
working in your soil, reducing organic debris into useable bits of 
nutrients for plants and other creatures to absorb.
It’s up to you to replenish organic matter and nutrients in your 
garden’s soil to provide an ongoing fuel source for all these creatures. 
One method for doing that is to incorporate compost regularly as 
recommended in Chapter 10. Another option is to plant a cover crop 
directly in your garden in advance of your planting season. Cover 
crops perform a role similar to that of compost, offering decaying 
organic matter for a host of bacteria, fungi, and other soil organisms 
to build a thriving soil food web.

 Chapter 11: Adding Cover Crops and Green Manures 169
Reducing soil compaction
Cover crops inhibit rain from splashing on bare ground, which 
disturbs the soil’s natural texture and causes compaction. Over 
time, compacted soil surfaces seal, impeding water penetration 
and facilitating runoff. In addition to promoting soil erosion, water 
runoff carries away nutrients and may leach undesirable or toxic 
substances into groundwater sources.
Improving tilth
The deep, fibrous root systems of many cover crops (especially 
grains and grasses) penetrate widely through the soil, creating 
elaborate avenues for effective air and water infiltration. This in 
turn improves tilth, which refers to soil’s physical ability to sup-
port plant growth. Soil with good tilth is loose, crumbly, and easy 
for you to dig in and work with. Deep-rooted crops are particularly 
useful for improving clay or silty soils.
Creating and adding nitrogen
Nitrogen is one of three essential elements that plants require to 
thrive. (The other two are phosphorus and potassium.) Nitrogen 
is in limited supply in many soils, and even if you’re lucky to 
garden where soils are nutrient-rich, nitrogen will be depleted with 
repeated growing cycles if you don’t replenish it with compost or 
fertilizer. Planting a legume cover crop, which is capable of pro-
ducing its own nitrogen, also enhances nitrogen availability in your 
garden. (Read more about this later in the chapter in the section 
“Legumes” as well as in the sidebar “Fixating on nitrogen.”)
Feeding beneficial insects
Cover crops offer habitat and food (in the form of pollen and 
nectar) for beneficial pollinators, such as bees. Without bees, meal-
time would be downright boring because these exceptional crea-
tures are responsible for pollinating one-third of the food crops 
that you and I consume. Cover crops also support myriad benefi-
cial predators, including lady beetles, parasitic wasps, predatory 
mites, and spiders. They serve as important biological control 
agents to keep pest populations in check without forcing you to 
resort to chemical pesticides.

170
Inhibiting weed growth
Cover crops are sometimes referred to as “living mulch” because 
of their ability to out-compete weeds. Just as a layer of compost 
mulch spread on top of the soil deters weeds (read more about 
that in Chapter 9), a dense cover crop suppresses weeds by shad-
ing the soil. When sunlight is blocked, weed seeds can’t germinate. 
Also, a thick cover crop out-competes existing weeds for sun, 
water, and air. If you’re struggling to get weed crops under con-
trol (perhaps a previous owner of your home let things get out 
of hand), plant a living mulch cover crop between rows in your 
garden or orchard.
Surveying Your Cover Crop Choices
Cover crops fall into three categories: legumes, grasses, and a 
catch-all “other” category. These plants may be annuals, which 
germinate, grow, set seed, and die in one season, or they may be 
perennials, which live for many years, although they typically go 
dormant in your region’s off-season. Regardless of grouping, cover 
crops exhibit some combination of the following characteristics, 
which make them very capable at their job. They
 
✓ Grow quickly to provide significant organic matter to add to 
the soil or compost heap
 
✓ Develop fibrous root systems that spread through soil
 
✓ Are relatively easy to cut or mow and incorporate into soil or 
add to the compost heap
 
✓ Add nitrogen
 
Legume cover crops add more nitrogen to your soil, whereas grass 
cover crops do a better job of increasing total organic matter. 
Sowing a cover crop that contains both a legume and a grass pro-
vides you with the best of both.
 
Many cover crops are workhorses that accept a broad range of 
growing conditions. Temperature is usually the limiting factor, 
because some won’t survive cold or tolerate extreme heat. For 
the fast track to figuring out which cover crop to plant, contact a 
full-service garden nursery or your nearest farm supply store for a 
quick and easy answer to your cover crop conundrum. (Even most 
urban areas have a farm supply store or two.) Staff can advise you 
on what works best in your region, and they can probably find it 
on their shelves, too.

 Chapter 11: Adding Cover Crops and Green Manures 171
Legumes
Legumes are plants that produce a bean or pea pod. Common 
legumes in gardens or landscapes that you may already grow 
include French, runner, or snap beans, peas, fragrant sweet pea 
flowers, acacia shrubs, and mesquite trees, to name just a handful. 
Cover crop legumes include alfalfa, beans, clovers, peas, and trefoil.
Legume plants have a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bac-
teria, in which they combine efforts to convert nitrogen in the 
air into a form of nitrogen that plant roots can absorb in the soil. 
This conversion process is called nitrogen fixation (see the sidebar 
“Fixating on nitrogen” for more).
Grasses
Unlike legumes, grasses (a category that includes cereal grains, 
such as oats) are not capable of nitrogen fixation, although they 
do add plenty of organic matter to your soil when cut and turned 
under. Their vigorous and matting root systems also inhibit soil 
erosion. Cover crops in this category include annual (Italian) or 
perennial ryegrass, Sudangrass, oats, cereal, grazing or winter rye 
(which isn’t the same as ryegrass), and winter wheat.
Fixating on nitrogen
All plants require nitrogen to grow. However, your soil’s nitrogen levels may be in 
short supply because of regional characteristics or may have become depleted 
over time with repeated growing cycles and insufficient replenishment with com-
post and fertilizer. Planting a cover crop of legumes is a great way to improve your 
soil’s nitrogen levels.
Although the atmosphere contains abundant nitrogen (almost 80 percent), it’s not 
in a form that plants can absorb. Legumes have mastered the process of convert-
ing this “free” atmospheric nitrogen into a form that becomes available in the soil 
for other plants to use. Legumes can’t perform this feat alone, though. In a mutu-
ally beneficial relationship, soil-dwelling Rhizobia bacteria assist legumes with the 
process of nitrogen fixation.
Within legume root nodules, bacteria produce a chemical that converts nitrogen 
from the air into nitrogen that the legume can absorb and use to make proteins. In 
exchange, the legume offers the bacteria sugars and carbohydrates for energy and 
continued growth. When leguminous cover crops decompose, nitrogen in their root 
nodules is released for other plants to use.

172
Other cover crops
Neither legume nor grass, buckwheat is an excellent cover crop if 
you need a fast-grower to out-compete weeds. It matures in 30 to 
45 days in warm weather. Buckwheat tolerates low-fertility soil and 
thrives in warm temperatures. Other cover crops that fall into this 
catchall category are cabbage-family crops such as kale and mus-
tard, fenugreek, and phacelia.
Planting and Turning 
Over Cover Crops
General characteristics of geographic gardening regions dictate 
when you should plant cover crops. This section offers guidelines 
for different sowing seasons, and I also give you instructions for 
ultimately incorporating your cover crop into the soil for decom-
position (yet another great form of composting!).
Sowing seasons
When to plant cover crops depends in part on your region’s gar-
dening seasons as well as on what you want to achieve with a 
cover crop. Are you protecting the soil from erosion during your 
area’s spring rainy season? If so, plant in fall so that crops are up 
and running by spring. Do you want to add a quick blast of nutri-
ents to the soil before starting a new summer garden? If so, sow 
crops as soon as possible after your last frost date. The following 
information provides you with planting schedules based on gen-
eral temperature and gardening seasons. Check with your favorite 
garden center, farm supply store, or county cooperative extension 
office to fine-tune your planting time.
 
✓ Cold and/or snowy winters with one short summer growing 
season: Planting period: August to late September. (Alternative 
planting period: After your area’s last frost in spring.)
 
 Sow cover crops in time for at least four weeks of growth before 
cold weather halts development. Crops germinate with the last 
of the warm soil temperatures and produce foliage to protect 
soil from erosion over winter. When temperatures warm in 
spring, growth of perennial crops will resume. If you’re waiting 
for optimal harvest time for vegetable crops still producing in 
your garden, you may sow cover crops between rows or “inter-
crop” around the edges of vegetable plants.

 Chapter 11: Adding Cover Crops and Green Manures 173
 
✓ Somewhat moderate temperatures and/or rainy winters 
with one longer growing season; most gardens dormant 
in winter: Planting period: August through early December 
(Alternative planting period: After your area’s last frost in 
spring.)
 
 The earlier the sowing, the better established the cover crop 
will be because most seeds don’t germinate well in cold and/
or wet soils.
 
✓ Warm or hot summers with two gardening seasons or 
year-round gardening: Planting period: May through June. 
(Alternative planting period: Before either gardening season.)
 
 The earlier you sow seeds the better, allowing your cover 
crop to establish before intense heat arrives. Late sowings 
require more moisture to germinate and get plants off to a 
good start.
Mixing your mature cover 
crop into the soil
As a general guideline, cut down and incorporate cover crops 
into the soil at least one to three weeks before planting your next 
garden in order to allow some decomposition to occur.
Benefits achieved from your cover crop depend on how long the 
crop is allowed to grow before you cut and turn it under. As a general 
guideline, allow plants to grow for as long as possible to maximize 
organic mass without developing woody stems or seed heads. Mature 
plant matter with hard or woody stems is more difficult physically for 
you to cut or mow and blend within the soil. It also contains higher 
levels of carbon, which soil microorganisms break down more slowly 
than nitrogen. (Flip back to Chapter 3 for an explanation of the pre-
ferred eating habits of decomposer organisms.)
When ready to harvest, chop or mow the foliage down, and then 
shred or break it into smaller segments for faster decomposition. 
If you want to plant quickly, the smaller the pieces, the less lumpy 
and bumpy your soil will be. If you’re in no hurry to plant, larger 
pieces are less of a problem.
Work the organic matter into the top layer of soil, using a soil fork, 
shovel, or spade. (The deeper it’s incorporated, the slower the 
decomposition rate.) Rototilling is another option for incorporat-
ing woody, coarse plant material.

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
174
 
If harvesting in spring, cut down cover crops when your average 
daily soil temperature hits 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees 
Celsius). This is when huge populations of soil organisms start 
gearing up for the decomposition process.
The following sections provide further suggestions for timing your 
harvest based on your goal for your soil.
Goal: Maximize the decomposition rate so nutrients are 
available as soon as possible for your next garden
When to harvest: Cut your crop when plants have full vegetative 
cover, but before blooms appear.
Fresh, moisture-rich foliage fosters a quick spike in soil microbial 
activity, which results in rapid decomposition of organic matter 
and release of nutrients. (This assumes there is also adequate 
moisture and aeration for decomposition to occur, as I explain in 
Chapter 3.)
Degree of difficulty: This is the easiest stage for you to cut and 
incorporate plant matter into the soil by hand.
Goal: Maximize total organic matter
When to harvest: Cut just before plants reach full bloom or when 
they’re in full bloom.
Allow plants to develop as much organic matter (scientists call this 
biomass) as possible before producing seeds. This time frame helps 
promote steady decomposition of organic materials and release of 
nutrients into the soil over a longer period than the next option.
Inoculating legumes
If planting a legume cover crop for the first time, coat the seeds with their appro-
priate rhizobial bacteria strain, called an inoculant, before sowing. This increases 
the legume’s capacity to fix nitrogen. (The earlier sidebar “Fixating on nitrogen” 
describes the symbiotic relationship between legumes and rhizobial bacteria.) 
Check with your seed supplier or read catalog seed descriptions to determine which 
inoculant is required, because specific strains exist for different legumes. Obtain 
fresh inoculant and apply just before planting according to product directions.
Some legume seeds are preinoculated, so you may be able to skip the above step. 
For annual plantings of the same legume, it isn’t necessary to reinoculate, because 
bacteria will remain in the soil.

 Chapter 11: Adding Cover Crops and Green Manures 175
Degree of difficulty: Coarser plant matter is more difficult to 
incorporate by hand.
Goal: Maximize soil aeration and reduce compaction
When to harvest: Cut after bloom but before seeds set. Long-
lasting root systems and woody, coarse plant matter enhances 
aeration through the soil.
Degree of difficulty: You’re likely to need a rototiller or other 
power equipment to incorporate woody material into the soil 
(check out the later section “To till or not to till”).
 
Timing is tricky if you wait to incorporate cover crops after blooming 
finishes. Be sure to cut plants and utilize them before they set seed. 
If allowed to go to seed, you may have cover crops reappearing for 
years to vex you! Buckwheat and hairy vetch may become invasive if 
allowed to go to seed.
Goal: Grow green matter to add to your compost pile
When to harvest: Cut just before plants reach full bloom or when 
they’re in full bloom. Add foliage to your compost pile as a source 
of nitrogen. (See Chapter 7 for details on nitrogen ingredients.) 
Allow the bottoms of the plants to die in place or incorporate into 
the soil to add organic matter. If removing the nitrogen-rich green 
foliage, realize those cover crops absorbed valuable nutrients from 
your soil that need to be replenished with some combination of 
compost and fertilizer before planting your next garden.
Degree of difficulty: This is an easy stage for you to cut foliage to 
add to compost.
To till or not to till
Tilling (also called rotary-tilling, rototilling, or rotovating) with 
equipment is a labor-saving method to incorporate organic matter 
from your cover crops into the soil. The blades or tines of the tiller 
slice through the top 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of soil, 
chopping and mixing uniformly. However, tilling also causes detri-
mental effects to your soil’s ecosystem and structure. It kills ben-
eficial soil organisms, such as earthworms. Overtilling pulverizes 
soil particles and damages soil structure, which in turn inhibits 
aeration and drainage and encourages compaction and erosion.
If your goal is to build soil structure bustling with microbial life 
(which is a major benefit of planting cover crops), you may want 
to limit tilling with equipment and turn the soil and incorporate 

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
176
organic matter by hand with a soil fork or shovel. (It’s good exer-
cise and actually kind of relaxing when you get into a rhythm.)
For larger areas where hand-turning isn’t feasible, limit the overall 
amount of tilling. It isn’t necessary to churn and pulverize every-
thing into salt-sized bits, which ruins soil structure. Keeping the 
majority of the organic residue in the top few inches of soil promotes 
microbial activity, so try to avoid tilling too deeply. Finally, never 
work with or walk on wet soil, which compacts it, reducing air and 
water penetration.
If you prefer to be a no-till gardener, check out the next chapter for 
another option. It covers a soil building method that requires no 
digging on your part. Instead, simply spread organic matter on the 
soil to decompose in place.

Chapter 12
Composting in Sheets
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the hows and whys of sheet composting
▶ Sheet composting and planting — in tandem
S
heet composting is a method of enriching your soil by adding 
organic matter. Instead of building a compost pile or filling a 
bin or trench, you spread your organic matter on top of the soil 
in sheets, where it can decompose right where you need it. In this 
chapter I cover the advantages and disadvantages of sheet com-
posting and explain how to do it. I conclude with an example of 
creating garden beds with a variant of sheet composting in which 
plants grow within layers of decomposing organic matter.
Sheet Composting: 
Read All About It
Sheet composting may remind you of other soil-improvement 
methods, like applying a layer of compost mulch as a top-dressing 
(see Chapter 9). The difference is that you want sheet compost to 
decompose quickly rather than remain in place to protect the soil 
over time. Because sheet composting provides organic matter and 
nutrients to the soil, it may be considered a variation of a cover 
crop (see Chapter 11). Unlike a cover crop, though, sheet compost 
doesn’t have to be chopped down at the end of its life cycle — it’s 
already dead and decomposing!
Pros and cons
Sheet composting is worth considering if you’re looking for a differ-
ent way to compost and enhance soil quality. This process has its 
advantages and disadvantages, but it’s worth noting that the poten-
tial problems I outline in this section are pretty easy to avoid or fix.
Just as you decide how much time and labor to expend on any 
compost pile you construct, you decide how much effort to invest in 
sheet composting. And just like a compost pile, the more upfront 

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
178
effort you invest, the speedier the decomposition rate. A great 
advantage of sheet composting is that it’s perfectly okay for busy 
gardeners to spread materials as they are and walk away to let 
them slowly decompose over time. Alternatively, you may incur 
a little more labor chopping organic matter into smaller pieces 
before spreading. You may also choose to turn your layer of sheet 
compost under the soil. These latter two actions speed up the 
decomposition process.
Although it’s initially quite easy to get started, sheet composting 
has a few negatives that require a little extra work to overcome. 
Materials may be slow to decompose in comparison to a compost 
pile with sufficient size to create hospitable conditions for the 
decomposer organisms that do the bulk of the work. (Read all about 
these creatures and their work habits in Chapter 3.) But if you’re 
enriching a new area and in no particular hurry, slow decomposition 
is an easy route to improved soil for future garden beds.
Another potential problem with sheet composting is that those hard-
working decomposer organisms mentioned previously may rob the 
soil of all available nitrogen sources as they break down carbon mate-
rials in the sheet compost layer, leaving insufficient nitrogen reserves 
in the soil for nearby plants to absorb. This effect is called nitrogen 
immobilization. Decomposers hold nitrogen in their bodies and 
recycle it repeatedly as they reproduce and die (and consume each 
other), until the rotting of your sheet compost is nearing completion. 
Then, the majority of organisms die off, releasing nitrogen stored in 
their bodies for plant roots to absorb. To ensure your plants don’t go 
hungry for nitrogen, allow at least one full season up to one year for 
decomposition to occur before planting.
If you have thick layers of wet, nitrogen-rich materials (such as fresh 
grass clippings or manure), keep the process from turning anaerobic 
and smelly by turning these types of materials under the soil or 
intermixing them with layers of dry, brown materials. (Flip back to 
Chapter 4 for more about anaerobic composting.)
 
If you choose to sheet compost kitchen scraps or food waste, turn 
it under the soil for faster decomposition and to deter pests. After 
turning food scraps under, spread another layer of non-kitchen scrap 
materials on top of the soil, such as dried leaves or straw. Other 
options for composting kitchen scraps include trench composting 
(see Chapter 4) or using pest-proof bins (see Chapter 5).
Finally, the process of sheet composting doesn’t reach sufficiently 
hot temperatures to kill weed seeds or plant pathogens. (For this 
reason, sheet composting is sometimes referred to as a “cold” 
method.) Be sure to eliminate any of those undesirables before 
spreading organic materials as sheet compost.

 Chapter 12: Composting in Sheets 179
Where and when to lay sheets of compost
A good location for sheet composting is an area where you’d like to 
eventually develop a new garden. Spread layers of sheet compost 
and get a jump-start on soil enrichment. Other good candidates for 
sheet composting are existing garden beds that you don’t mind let-
ting go fallow (unplanted) for at least 3 to 12 months.
 
Plan on your sheet compost taking at least a full season and as 
much as one year to decompose before you replant. The actual 
time involved depends on the type of organic matter you spread, 
the thickness of the layer of organic matter, and how much prep 
work you choose to do.
When to spread sheet compost depends on your growing region 
and time frame for planting. If you’re sheet composting to start a 
new bed in a year or two, timing isn’t crucial, and you can simply 
layer materials when you have them.
If you’re sheet composting atop an existing garden, apply organic 
matter when you’ve pulled spent plants at the end of your grow-
ing season. Organic materials can decompose during the dormant 
season when you aren’t growing anything, anyway.
 
As long as the spent plants you pull aren’t infested with pests or 
diseases, you can toss them on top of the soil as part of your sheet 
composting ingredients.
In regions with hot summers and year-round growing, sheet 
compost is typically spread at the end of spring gardening. 
Decomposition occurs over summer, and you’re ready to replant 
when temperatures abate in fall. However, decomposition may be 
slow if materials dry out and summer rains are sparse. You may 
need to occasionally sprinkle water over your sheet compost to 
keep the process going.
In regions where summer is the main growing season, layer sheet 
compost in fall and let it decompose during winter, or winter 
and spring. You’ll be ready to prepare soil and plant in spring or 
summer, depending on your local conditions and how rapidly 
material decomposes. Another option is apply sheet compost in 
summer (assuming you don’t want to plant) and let it decompose 
until the following spring.
Getting down to ingredients
Use the same types of organic matter for sheet composting that you 
would add to a compost pile, including both browns, such as dried 
leaves, cardboard, and straw, and greens, such as grass clippings 
and spent garden plants. Even fresh weeds can be pulled and used 
as greens, as long as they don’t have seeds or spread by invasive 

Part IV: Expanding Your Compost Horizons  
180
root runners that survive to infiltrate your garden. However, let 
other weeds wilt thoroughly first before adding them to make sure 
they don’t survive and regrow. Refer to Chapter 7 for a list of com-
postable organic materials to employ with sheet composting. If you 
include kitchen scraps, see the warning in the “Pros and cons” 
section earlier in this chapter.
 
If you want to speed up the decomposition process for sheet com-
posting, chop or shred organic matter into small pieces before 
spreading it. The smaller the initial pieces of organic matter, the 
more surface area is available to the decomposer organisms. Also, 
incorporating your sheet compost layer under the top few inches 
of soil after you spread it hastens decomposition. You can do this 
by hand with a soil fork or shovel, or use a rototiller (see caveats 
on tilling the soil in Chapter 11).
Use one of the following methods, depending on the ingredients 
you choose to incorporate in your sheet compost:
 
✓ Apply about 2 to 8 inches (5 to 20 centimeters) of organic 
material over the area to decompose in place as is. When 
you’re ready to plant the next season, turn the remains of the 
organic matter under.
 
✓ If you have only wet, compacted materials high in nitrogen, 
such as fresh grass clippings or manure, apply in a thin 
layer (1 to 3 inches, or 2.5 to 8 centimeters). Then turn it 
under to speed decomposition and reduce odor potential. 
Alternatively, mix in wet, heavy stuff with dry, loose carbon 
materials, such as shredded leaves or straw.
Sheet Composting and 
Gardening in One Step
Spreading layers of organic matter on top of your soil as sheet 
compost may call to mind what you observe walking along a trail 
through the woods. Mother Nature piles up a wealth of organic 
debris — leaves, pine needles, fallen trees, animal waste, and much 
more. Moistened periodically by rain and snow, churned by wind, 
and consumed by decomposer organisms, all this debris gradually 
transforms into sweet-smelling humus. (Chapter 1 describes this 
ultimate end product of decomposition.) Amazingly diverse plant 
life sprouts and grows in this top layer of nutrient-rich rotted 
organic matter. This section explains how to copy that method in 
your garden.
Mimicking Mother Nature’s proven methods is what permaculture is 
all about. Very simply stated, permaculture is a system of observing
and copying nature to reduce humans’ negative impacts on the 
planet. Its goal is to integrate human needs for shelter and food 

 Chapter 12: Composting in Sheets 181
with a region’s existing intertwined relationships among plants, 
animals, soils, and climate variations.
Building garden soil
Permaculture principles offer diverse techniques depending on 
your needs and regional characteristics. However, the following soil-
building procedure (see Figure 12-1) adapted from permaculture 
methods works wherever you garden and provides an easy introduc-
tion to working with and benefiting from natural processes:
 
1. Remove or cut any existing vegetation low to the ground, 
and rake the area smooth.
 
2. Sprinkle organic nitrogen fertilizer, such as alfalfa meal 
or cottonseed meal, to cover the area.
 
 Follow recommendations on the packaging for amounts 
to apply.
 
 Blood meal and fish meal are also organic nitrogen sources. 
However, their scents, although not overly noticeable to 
humans, may attract pests, including dogs that dig with 
glee to find the source.
 
3. Layer 6 inches (15 centimeters) of compost or aged 
manure on top of the nitrogen.
 
 Fresh manure develops a “hot” zone as it decomposes, 
which may burn plant roots. If only fresh manure is avail-
able, wait at least two months to sow seeds or transplant 
seedlings into the mix as described in the next section.

4. Moisten all materials to the consistency of a wrung-out 
sponge.
 
5. Spread a 1⁄4-inch-thick (6.35 millimeter) layer of cardboard 
and/or newspaper on top of the compost/manure layer. 
Weigh it down with bricks, rocks, or shovels of soil to 
stop it from blowing about as you work.
 
6. Soak the paper layer thoroughly with water.
 
 In lieu of soaking this layer after you spread it, you can soak 
your paper/cardboard in a tub of water before spreading it.
 
7. Spread 6 inches (15 centimeters) of straw as the top layer, 
watering it as you work to ensure even moisture 
throughout.
Planting in sheet compost beds
After building your layers of organic matter as I describe in the 
preceding section, you’re ready to plant. Take another look at 
Figure 12-1 and follow these steps:
 
1. Pull apart the straw to create a hole the size of your fist.
 
2. Use a trowel to cut an opening in the paper/cardboard 
layer.
 
 If the paper or cardboard is stiff, use a utility knife to cut 
through it. This opening allows future plant roots to spread 
unimpeded.
 
3. Fill the hole with a handful or two of soil from an existing 
garden (dig some soil from the landscape if you don’t yet 
have a garden).
 
 Soil harbors zillions of local decomposer organisms ready 
to start breaking down organic matter in your new garden.
 
4. Sow seeds or transplant seedlings into the soil.
 
5. Water and feed them as required in any garden situation.
Planting next year’s garden
Within a year’s time, your organic matter layers will have broken 
down, and you can turn the sheet compost under to enrich the 
soil. Alternatively, you may also use this permaculture sheet 
composting method as a true “no-till” method of soil building (see 
Chapter 11 for details on the pluses and minuses of tilling the 
soil). Simply rebuild the layers as described in the earlier section 
“Building garden soil” to repeat the process year after year without 
turning the compost under.

Questions about Compost

▶ Recognizing and using finished compost
N
ot that many years ago, most folks with even a small yard 
grew some of their own produce and typically had a com-
post pile nearby for improving their garden soil. Composting was 
something that people just knew how to do, and kids absorbed the 
skill by turning the pile or working in the garden as part of their 
chores! However, composting knowledge seems to have slipped by 
the wayside for many folks, if the number of questions I’ve fielded 
is any indication. If you’re a newbie when it comes to composting, 
the following quick answers to commonly asked questions will get 
you right up to speed and ready to dig in.
What Is Compost, Really?
Compost is a blend of decayed and decaying organic materials. 
Although similar to compost, humus is organic matter that has 
reached its final state of decomposition. Compost may be lay-
ered on top of the soil as mulch, although other organic mulches, 
such as wood or bark chips, aren’t sufficiently decomposed to be 
considered compost. You improve your garden beds by adding 
compost because it helps retain moisture and nutrients in sandy 
soil and improves drainage and aeration in clay soil. Regardless of 
soil type, compost improves soil structure and provides nutrients 
to plants. You can make compost easily from yard wastes, kitchen 
scraps, and household waste such as paper and cardboard.
What Are Browns and Greens?
Composters refer to organic matter that’s high in carbon as browns 
and material that’s high in nitrogen as greens. Carbon materials 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
186
for composting include dry leaves, woody plant trimmings, straw, 
paper, cardboard, and sawdust. Grass clippings, spent garden 
plants, fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, and 
manure are nitrogen sources. When mixing up a batch of compost, 
combine about three parts brown with one part green.
Can I Compost All My Kitchen 
Scraps? What about Pet Waste?
When it comes to compostable materials and what can and can’t 
go in your pile or bin, it’s not a free-for-all. Don’t put meat, bones, 
fish, dairy, oils, or grease in your compost pile or bin. They may 
turn rancid and smelly and may attract pests, such as rodents, 
dogs, foxes, raccoons, and others.
Never put cat, dog, or pet bird waste in your compost. It may con-
tain pathogens that can be transmitted to humans.
Do I Have to Purchase a 
Container to Compost?
Organic matter doesn’t need to rot in a container. It decomposes 
just as well in a free-standing pile aboveground or in a hole in the 
ground. However, a container is a much more efficient use of space 
and makes it easier to produce compost faster if you maintain 
its contents. You can fashion a compost container from recycled 
materials that cost nothing, or next-to-nothing, depending on your 
scavenging skills. For example, four shipping pallets create a com-
post bin that’s pretty darn close to ideal size.
 
Check with your area’s solid waste management facility for avail-
ability of free used garbage cans repurposed as composters. Some 
of these agencies may also offer manufactured containers at a 
reduced price to encourage composting organic matter at home 
rather than sending it to a landfill.
Do I Have to Turn Compost 
Regularly?
Nope. Some pleasant day, take a break from your busy schedule 
and go for an amble through the woods. You won’t see legions of 
Mother Nature’s minions turning rotting organic matter with pitch-
forks. Yet, the forest floor is covered with lovely, black humus. 

 Chapter 13: Ten Answers to Common Questions about Compost 187
The decomposition process is ongoing all around us, whether or 
not we participate. As long as you’re in no hurry to obtain finished 
compost, feel free to pile it up and let it rot on its own timetable. 
I recommend that laid-back gardeners follow the instructions for 
making basic compost in Chapter 8 to get off to a good start.
How Long before Organic Matter 
Becomes Compost?
“It depends” is the quick (but not terribly illuminating) answer. 
Factors influencing the speed of decomposition include the mix of 
carbon and nitrogen materials, how small the pieces are, moisture 
content, aeration in the pile, and the temperature of the season. In 
general, plan on an average of 31⁄2 to 6 months to achieve useable 
compost. This time frame assumes you start with an appropriate 
ratio of chopped or shredded green (nitrogen) and brown (carbon) 
ingredients and that you moisten all the organic matter as you 
build a pile at least 1 cubic yard (1 cubic meter) in size. If you turn 
this pile two or three times to aerate and add moisture as needed, 
you’ll harvest some compost within two months! Toss any unde-
composed pieces back into the heap or into a new pile to break 
down further.
Obtaining compost in as little as three or four weeks is also 
entirely doable (see Chapter 8). Start out as I describe in the pre-
ceding paragraph, and then monitor the pile’s daily temperature, 
turning it about four times to coincide with temperature drops.
How Do I Know When My 
Compost Is Ready to Use?
Finished compost is dark brown — almost black — in color. Its 
texture is loose, crumbly, and uniform in size. Most of the original 
ingredients are now unrecognizable. (If there are any larger chunks 
of materials that haven’t fully decomposed, toss them into a new 
pile to break down further in the next round.) If you’ve been main-
taining a hot pile (see Chapter 3 for more on this), the composted 
material won’t reheat after turning once it’s ready to use. If you 
squeeze a handful of compost, it should be moist. Finished com-
post smells pleasant and earthy.

Can’t I Just Send My Yard and 
Household Waste to a Landfill 
to Decompose?
Why all the fuss about composting at home? It may surprise you, as 
it did me the first time I read about it, but organic materials don’t 
decompose particularly well in a landfill. Heavy equipment packs 
and compresses the refuse so tightly that most of the air is forced 
out. Without oxygen, the efficient aerobic decomposer organisms 
(see Chapter 3) can’t do their work. Garbologists, scientists who 
study what happens to the world’s garbage, have dug down into the 
depths of landfills to uncover perfectly readable old newspapers 
and recognizable (although probably not very enticing) food items.
There are also sustainability issues related to the mountains of trash 
humans generate for landfills. Trucks and heavy-equipment burn 
gasoline and produce air pollution while hauling and burying the 
refuse. Many landfills have met their capacity, and there’s a lack 
of space to build more (nobody wants a landfill in their backyard). 
And don’t forget that methane gas, a culprit in global warming, is a 
byproduct of landfills.
Can I Compost in Winter?
Yes, composting can take place throughout the year. As tem-
peratures cool, the faster-working mesophilic and thermophilic 
microorganisms will taper off and the cool-loving but slower-acting 
psychrophiles will take over. You can also insulate your pile with 
a thick layer of leaves, straw, or sod to help it retain heat through 
the winter. Some decomposition will occur, but things will really 
perk up again as temperatures warm in spring.
Can I Use Compost instead 
of Fertilizer?
Compost is considered a soil amendment or improver rather than 
a fertilizer. Because your compost’s nutrient levels vary consider-
ably from batch to batch due to original ingredients and method 
of decomposition, it’s impossible to know what nutrients it con-
tains without testing. Even so, most compost contains a wide 
variety of nutrients, including trace elements, to support healthy 
plant growth, so adding compost to your garden most certainly 
improves soil fertility.

C
omposting is a fairly straightforward activity because decom-
position continues whether or not you fuss over your organic 
matter. But if something doesn’t seem quite right to you, this 
chapter may provide the advice you need to get your composting 
efforts back on track or alleviate your concerns.
Slow Decomposition
I tell you how organic matter decomposes to produce compost in 
Chapter 3, but like so many things in life, decomposition doesn’t 
always go according to plan. Many factors can slow the decompo-
sition of your compost. This list covers some of the more promi-
nent causes and ways to combat them:
 
✓ Lack of moisture: A fast-decomposing compost pile contains 
40 to 60 percent water. A handful of organic matter should feel 
damp, like a wrung-out sponge.
 
✓ Insufficient nitrogen: Organic matter should be about one 
part nitrogen (green) material to three parts carbon (brown) 
material. Greens are sometimes in short supply when piles 
get built, or they decompose so quickly that you need to add 
more nitrogen materials later.
 
✓ Too much or too little mass: The best pile size for optimal 
decomposition is between 3 cubic feet (3 feet tall x 3 feet wide x 
3 feet deep, or 1 cubic meter) and 5 cubic feet (1.5 cubic meters). 
At this size, the pile can self-insulate and retain heat and mois-
ture, but it’s not so large that airflow to the center is blocked.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
190
 
✓ Poor aeration: The aboveground efficient decomposer organ-
isms need oxygen to thrive. As oxygen in the pile is depleted, 
decomposition slows. Turning the pile periodically incorpo-
rates fresh oxygen. You can also insert aeration tubes when 
you build a pile to improve airflow.
 
✓ Cold weather: The most productive decomposer organisms 
function in warm temperatures. To improve heat retention 
during cold weather, increase the pile size, insulate the outer 
edges of your pile with thick layers of straw, leaves, or sod, or 
cover it with a tarp.
Hovering Swarms of Teeny Flies
The bugs you may occasionally see swarming over your compost 
pile are the same vinegar flies you may find congregating indoors 
around a bowl of ripe fruit. These gnat-like flies are harmless, 
although you might consider them a nuisance. Gardeners in the 
United Kingdom call them compost flies, and in the United States, 
they also go by the name of fruit flies. Female vinegar flies lay eggs 
on fruit and vegetable skins, and the hatching larvae feed on the 
fungi found in rotting fruits and vegetables. To control these pesky 
fliers, bury kitchen scraps and food waste deep within the compost 
pile. When adding kitchen waste to an existing pile, cover it with 
an inch of soil, plus several inches of dry, brown materials, such as 
leaves or straw.
Fat, White Grubs
The fat, white grubs you may unearth in your pile are the larvae 
of various scarab beetles, such as Japanese beetles, June beetles, 
or dung beetles. The grubs have six legs and darker colored heads 
ranging from tan to reddish orange. They thrive in the moist rich-
ness of your compost pile, feeding on and breaking down rotting 
organic matter, which makes them beneficial indeed. If you so 
choose, handpick the grubs and leave them out in the open as a 
succulent treat for birds.
In most arid climates, these grubs aren’t known to pose significant 
problems to living plants. However, in other climates, some spe-
cies are serious pests that eat and destroy the root systems of 
lawns and agricultural crops. If you believe your grub population 
is out of control or suspect the grubs are damaging other plants, 
check with your county cooperative extension office or local nurs-
ery to find out which species live in your area and how to control 
them.

 Chapter 14: Ten Tips for Troubleshooting Compost 191
Dead Vermicomposting Worms
Worms absolutely, positively must be surrounded by moist bed-
ding. If bedding dries out, their skin dries out, and they die. A 
general guideline is to maintain bedding at least 8 inches (20 
centimeters) deep that has the dampness of a wrung-out sponge. 
Food scraps may provide additional moisture, but you can also 
spray extra water on your pile periodically. Worms don’t want to 
live in a swamp, though, so be careful about excess moisture. A 
proper food supply also keeps your vermicomposting worms alive 
and squirming. Your worms will consume their bedding if no food 
scraps are available. For the full scoop on vermicomposting and 
keeping your worms alive and well, check out Chapter 10.
Lots of Bugs Crawling About
Relax, sit back, and enjoy the show! You’re witnessing some of 
nature’s decomposers at work. Bugs are a sign that all is well in 
your compost world. Along with billions of microorganisms you 
can’t see without a microscope, visible macroorganisms inhabit 
your pile to physically break down organic matter. Common 
compost pile denizens include pillbugs (crawlers) and springtails 
(jumpers). Read more about decomposer organisms in Chapter 3.
Ammonia Odor
A properly constructed and managed compost pile does not smell. 
A strong ammonia scent is usually caused by too much nitrogen 
(greens). (For details on the proper balance of ingredients in your 
compost pile, turn to Chapter 7.) When there’s an overabundance 
of nitrogen, the decomposer organisms can’t process it fast enough, 
and the excess nitrogen is released to the atmosphere as ammonia. 
Excess moisture in the pile may also contribute to an ammonia 
odor. Turn the pile and add more carbon-rich materials, such as dry 
leaves, straw, shredded paper, or sawdust. If you purchase compost 
in bulk and it smells of ammonia, let it mature further before using.
Rotten Egg Odor
I repeat, a properly constructed and managed compost pile does 
not smell! If you sniff a rotten egg odor, pile contents have become 
compacted, compressed, and/or too wet. When air can’t penetrate, 
aerobic decomposers fade away, and their anaerobic cousins 
assume control. Anaerobic decomposers give off smelly hydrogen 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
192
sulfide gas as a byproduct of their efforts. That’s why landfills 
smell bad — heavy equipment compacts the refuse and anaero-
bic composting organisms do all the work. In your compost pile, 
you’re likely to have matted grass clippings, globs of fresh manure, 
slurry-like kitchen waste, or other high-nitrogen pockets. Introduce 
more oxygen by turning the entire pile, and incorporate dry leaves, 
straw, or shredded paper to soak up excess moisture as needed.
Slurry-Like Compost
If your compost is too thin and liquid, the cause may be your compost 
pile environment or its ingredients. Cover open bins or freestanding 
piles with a waterproof tarp. If you live in a rainy climate, consider an 
enclosed container (see Chapter 5). If you have a covered bin or pile 
and the consistency of the compost becomes too wet, spread it on 
the ground to dry out and/or mix it up with more dry, bulky brown 
materials, such as wood chips, straw, and sawdust.
Eek! A Mouse in the Compost
Mice seek warm, dry organic materials in which to build their 
nests. Layers of straw and leaves, especially if turned infrequently, 
are perfect from a mouse’s perspective. To discourage mice, turn 
open piles regularly and moisten materials thoroughly. Rats in and 
around the pile are more problematic because they may spread 
disease to humans. Don’t add potentially rat-attracting meat, 
bones, grease, fats, oils, or dairy products to compost piles. You 
can also compost in an enclosed container to keep out vermin. 
Read more about pest-proofing your bins in Chapter 5.
Animals Scattering Compost
Don’t put meat, bones, fish, dairy, oil, or grease in your pile, which 
may attract animal pests. If you compost other kitchen scraps, bury 
them in the center of the pile. Alternatively, you can cover kitchen 
scraps with an inch of soil or finished compost, and then layer 
several more inches of dry materials on top. If the problem contin-
ues, switch to an animal-proof enclosed bin with a secure top and 
bottom. Chapter 5 provides recommendations on keeping animals 
out of compost containers without interfering with decomposition.
