Into Something Rich
and Strange
By Barth Anderson
29 November 2004
As soon as I realized that the rapacious,
rot-sucking revenant would not stop till I was
dead, I changed my phone number. I changed
the locks on my windows, my doors, I let my
beard grow out, and I changed—
Wait. Let me rewind. The story of how I came
to be known as the Great Bringweather really
starts with the muffin—a luscious punk rocker
with a strong geek for the guitar. Worse for me,
he was a sullen misfit with placid brown eyes
and soft hands.
In short, he spun my heart like a pinwheel.
I met the muffin at a Chinese restaurant slash
dive called the White Monkey-Tiger. Lank,
wax-black mohawk draped over half his face,
he sat in a red vinyl booth surrounded by a
cadre of what appeared to be either the
members of a band or too-old-for-D&D boys
(they were both, I later learned), all of them
tilting a pitcher of beer into their glasses and
conversing with an irresistible intensity that
alerted me to the presence of the Holy Fire.
I was in my early seventies, young by the
standards of my craft, but shy about leaping
across the gulf between our years. It took
several Fridays of sidling nearer, like a natural
scientist earning the trust of lowland gorillas, but
eventually, Devin (lead guitarist, Dungeon
Master, and delicious muffin-to-be) invited me
to drink with them. I needn't have worried about
my age. We found a wide field of things to talk
about: Norse mythology, Malcolm McLaren,
skateboard technology (I mostly listened), and
Wagnerian opera. Over the next few weekends,
I became a regular at their corner table.
Then one Friday, Devin's band of
musician-adventurers didn't show. It was just me
and the muffin, and soon we were knee-deep in
his favorite topic, his yet-to-be-performed punk
opera about King Arthur. Though he'd been
invited to submit it for a grant, he felt his libretto
was too breezy, didn't carry proper mythic
weight

It starts again. The baby
begins to cough and
choke.

You can never let
anyone suspect, his
mother told him. That
was the first rule she
taught him, and the last,
before she left him here
alone with It.

Pale as he was, it was
hard to believe he would
never rise from this bed.
Even in the darkest
times, she had never
really feared for him; he
had always been strong,
so strong.
Love Among the Talus

Nilufer raised her eyes to
his. It was not what
women did to men, but
she was a princess, and
he was only a bandit. "I
want to be a Witch," she
said. "A Witch and not a
Queen. I wish to be not
loved, but wise. Tell your
bandit lord, if he can give
me that, I might accept
his gift."
