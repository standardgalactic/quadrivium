Cardiac Performance
Consider the Pressure-Volume (PV) Loop below. The black PV loop (designated 
by ABCD) depicts the LV of a normal heart. 
1. The red PV loop depicts the LV of a heart with:
 
A. decreased systemic pressure (after load)
 
B. increased systemic pressure (after load)
2. What occurs at C and G?
 
A. AV valve closes
 
B. aortic valve opens
 
C. AV valve opens
 
D. aortic valve closes
3. What occurs at D and H?
 
A. AV valve closes
 
B. aortic valve opens
 
C. AV valve opens
 
D. aortic valve closes
4. Are the stroke volumes (SV) for these two hearts equal?
 
A. Yes, each is 60 mls
 
B. No, red loop SV is 150 ml; black loop SV is 120 mls.
 
C. No, red loop SV is 90 mls; black loop SV is 60 mls
5. Are the ejection fractions of these two hearts equal? 
 
A. Yes, each is 50%
 
B.  No. Black loop EJ = 60/120 x 100 = 50%; Red loop EJ = 60/150 x 100 
= 40%

Answer 1: B. increased systemic pressure (after load)
Answer 2: B. aortic valve opens
Answer 3: D. aortic valve closes
Answer 4: A. Yes, each is 60 mls
Answer 5: B.  No. Black loop EJ = 60/120 x 100 = 50%; Red loop EJ = 60/150 x 100 = 40%
