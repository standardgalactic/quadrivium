Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank Natalie Pao for providing me the opportunity to write this book, and for 
her generous and gracious assistance. Ms. Pao is indeed a first-rate professional. Without 
her vision, this book may not have come into being.
I’d also like to thank Jessica Vakili for her assistance during the writing process.  
I threw lots of questions at her, but she never failed to reply in a pleasant, professional 
manner.

Introduction
For those seeking an image editing application with broad capabilities, but don’t require an 
“industrial strength” (not to mention expensive) solution, Pixlr Editor is the ideal choice.
A huge benefit this program offers is that it’s free! There are no discs or downloads to 
purchase, nor are there any subscriptions that must be purchased month after month  
(or year after year, for that matter).
Aside from being free to use, Pixlr Editor offers the perfect balance of convenience 
and power. Because it’s browser-based, it’s easy to launch from any computer with at 
least 2GB of RAM and a reliable Internet connection. There’s nothing to download, so just 
launch it and you’re ready to go. Pixlr Editor is easy to use for minor image editing tasks, 
yet powerful enough to handle more complex work.
Pixlr Express is a lightweight web-based application designed primarily for 
performing basic editing tasks and applying effects to images. If you’d like to try this  
easy-to-use editor, visit https://pixlr.com/express/.
Who This Book Is For
This book is for anyone with little to no image editing experience seeking a robust 
application without a high price tag (or an extremely steep learning curve). It’s for the 
family archivist who wants to digitally retouch and restore old family photos. It’s for 
budding digital photographers who want to improve the quality of the images they 
capture. It’s for the small business owner who needs to edit images for digital marketing 
materials or company publications.
I believe this book can be especially useful to art and photography teachers with the 
desire to introduce students to entry level image editing. For some of these educators, 
teaching digital image editing may now be out of the question because of school budget 
issues. They are often too tight to allow software subscriptions or purchases.
Because Pixlr Editor is free to use, this could be a game-changer for those teachers. 
This program works on any platform (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux/UNIX) that has an  
up-to-date browser, sufficient RAM, and a reliable Internet connection.
It should be noted that toward the end of this book’s production, Pixlr Editor was 
acquired by 123RF from Autodesk. According to the acquisition announcement, Pixlr 
Editor will revised and updated on an ongoing basis.
To keep this book as up to date as possible, a supplemental PDF titled Beginning 
Pixlr Editor Updates can be obtained from the Source Code/Downloads tab from this 
Apress page: http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.
It will be revised as needed every few weeks.

﻿ ■ Introduction

How This Book Is Structured
This book is written for primarily for novices. For the totally uninitiated, there are 
supplemental aids included as downloadable PDF documents, as well as practice JPEG 
and PXD (the native Pixlr format) images. The supplemental learning materials are 
included for the benefit of beginners with no experience in image editing. The Tools 
Tryout Guide and Practice Images provides instructions for hands-on learning in the use 
of each tool. The Beginner’s Guide to Layers will get beginners familiar with the various 
roles layers play in image editing.
Part I of this book acquaints readers with topics such as the launch screen, the 
workspace, palettes, the menu bar, and various tools (to name a few). Part II contains 25 
step-by-step tutorials spanning Chapters 4 through 10.
For those readers who are busy teachers, there are chapter tests and an answer key 
available for download as PDF documents, which you can administer to your students 
(saving you the time and hassle of preparing tests yourself).
■
■Note  Pixlr Editor is quite similar to Adobe Photoshop in many of its core functions. 
For students who will study image editing after high school (and because taking Photoshop 
classes will most likely be required), many of the skills acquired learning Pixlr Editor will be 
very useful and will help reduce the learning curve in learning Photoshop.
All of the downloadable supplemental material, tests, answer key, and practice images 
can be can be obtained from the Source Code/Downloads tab from this Apress page: 
http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.
Macintosh Users
The tutorials in this book use the Windows (and Linux/UNIX) keyboard shortcuts.  
If you are a Macintosh user, the Mac equivalents of these Windows counterparts are 
listed in Table 1.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xix
Improving with Practice
The tutorials in this book help you learn a great deal about photo editing; they provide 
step-by-step instructions to help you get acquainted with the mechanics of Pixlr Editor, 
as well as image editing basics. It’s a good idea to use Pixlr Editor on a regular basis to 
hone the skills that you learn from studying this book. Just like any other skill, to get good 
at it takes a lot of practice. Old family photos with minor damage can provide you with a 
great deal of practice, and you’ll help preserve your family history in the bargain.
If you like creating graphics, it’s possible to spend countless hours creating raster 
illustrations using Pixlr Editor. If you’ve never done any image editing before, you might 
just find it to be so much fun you can’t pull yourself away!

CHAPTER 1
An Overview of Pixlr Editor
This chapter covers several basic but important aspects of Pixlr Editor that will be 
especially useful for those new to image editing. This chapter covers the following topics:
• 
Launching Pixlr Editor: In this section, we’ll take a look at 
launching the application for the first time.
• 
The Pixlr Editor Workspace: This part essentially provides 
an overall look at the interface and where all of the tools and 
functions in Pixlr Editor are located.
• 
Pixel-Based Images Explained: Pixlr Editor works with pixel-based 
(or raster) images, which will be covered in this portion.
• 
File Formats: In this section, we’ll take a look at the types of file 
formats Pixlr Editor can open and save, as well as the differences 
between them.
• 
Opening Images: This part provides guidance in how to open 
images in Pixlr Editor.
• 
Saving Images: Shows where to save your images, and the file 
format options available to save them as.
■
■Note  If you’re new to image editing, I suggest following along on your computer after 
launching Pixlr Editor to become better acquainted with the start screen, workspace, and 
opening/saving files.
Launching Pixlr Editor
The fact that Pixlr Editor works in web browsers makes it very convenient to access and 
simple to launch. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:
• 
The Adobe Flash plug-in must be installed on your system for 
the application to work. It’s highly likely that it’s already on your 
computer, but if it’s not, you can get it free by following this link: 
https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
4
• 
A fast, reliable Internet connection is required.
• 
Pixlr Editor works in most web browsers, but it may not work in 
older, outdated versions. For best results, make sure you have the 
latest version installed on your system.
• 
Your computer should have sufficient RAM installed (I suggest a 
minimum of 2GB).
There’s more than one path to launch the application, but the most direct way is 
to use the following URL: https://pixlr.com/editor/. The application interface will 
launch, displaying a start screen with options to create or open images (Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1.  The Pixlr Editor start screen
We’ll take a closer look at the start screen a little later in this chapter, but for now 
(if you’re following along on your computer) close it out by clicking the white X in the 
upper-right corner of the butterfly graphic. This will allow an unobstructed view of the 
workspace.

The Pixlr Editor Workspace
Now, let’s become better acquainted with the Pixlr Editor workspace—we’ll just take 
a quick tour in this section for now, but topics such as tools, the menu bar, etc., will be 
explored in greater depth in later chapters. Figure 1-2 shows the Pixlr Editor workspace 
and identifies the main parts.
Figure 1-2.  The Pixlr Editor workspace
Here’s a quick breakdown of the Pixlr Editor workspace:
	
1.	
The Toolbar—This palette contains the digital tools you’ll 
work with. There are tools for making selections, applying 
colors, erasing portions of an image, etc. Because there are so 
many, each tool will be examined more closely in Chapter 2.
	
2.	
Additional Options—Most tools can be configured as needed. 
For example, you can adjust the diameter, shape, opacity, and 
flow of the brush tools. Not all tools have additional options.
	
3.	
The Menu Bar—The menu bar contains a sundry of functions 
for image editing. You’ll find commands for opening and saving 
images, adjusting images, applying filters for effects, and much 
more. There are many functions contained in the menu bar, all 
of which will be examined more closely in Chapter 3.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor

4.	
User Login/Logout and User Settings—After creating a Pixlr 
account, this area is where you can log in or out, as well as 
update your account information.
■
■Note  Creating a Pixlr account is free, and you are not required to submit any sensitive 
personal information. Pixlr Editor can be used without an account, but you won’t be able 
to save images to the Pixlr Library, only to your computer (or an external storage such as a 
flash drive).
	
5.	
The Navigator Palette—This feature helps you find your way 
around the image at close magnification (Figure 1-3).
Figure 1-3.  The Navigator Palette
	
6.	
The Layers Palette—This is one of the areas where you’ll 
work with layers (you can also access them from the menu 
bar to some extent). The Layers Palette displays a thumbnail 
image of each layer (Figure 1-4). Each layer can be named, be 
re-ordered in the stack, the opacity lowered, deleted, etc.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
7
■
■Note  If you’re a complete beginner to image editing, layers can be thought of as clear 
sheets that contain a graphical element. When stacked one on top of another, they combine 
to form a complete image. To learn more, refer to the The Beginner’s Guide to Layers PDF, 
which can be obtained from the Source Code/Downloads tab of this Apress page:  
http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.
	
7.	
The History Palette—When working with Pixlr Editor, a 
snapshot of each editing step is stored in the History Palette, 
showing up to 16 actions (Figure 1-5). This allows you revert 
to an earlier point in the editing process should you find it 
necessary to revise any previous editing steps or eliminate 
mistakes.
Figure 1-4.  The Layers Palette helps manage layers

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor

8.	
The Image Window/Canvas—This is where the image 
you are working on appears. The image may be a digital 
photograph or a blank canvas for a graphic design you intend 
to create.
	
9.	
Status Bar—This shows the dimensions of the image in pixels, 
as well as the zoom percentage.
	
10.	
Advertisements—Because Pixlr Editor is free, it’s supported 
by advertisements. The ad is small, but can be closed if 
desired.
Pixel-Based Images Explained
Pixel-based images (also known as raster images) are comprised of many tiny squares 
called pixels. A pixel (derived from the term picture element) is an individual unit of color 
and tonal value as represented on a computer display. The color and value of each pixel 
can vary—when viewed at close magnification, the block-like appearance is obvious 
(Figure 1-6), but when viewed from a distance the colors and tones appear to gradually 
and smoothly transition in the image.
Figure 1-5.  The History Palette allows the user to revert to an earlier point in the editing 
process

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
9
As the name suggests, Pixlr Editor is a pixel-based image editing application.  
This means that images are resolution-dependent. When a digital photo is resized 
too much, the image quality diminishes. Pixlr Editor is designed to output images for 
digital/web-based displays, not high-end print such as that one would acquire from a 
service bureau. However, it is possible to output files as standard-sized photographic 
prints, provided you start with a high resolution image to edit. This will be explained in 
greater detail in Chapter 4.
You may have heard the term vector graphics, but aren’t sure what it means. Even 
though they aren’t relevant to Pixlr Editor, vector graphics warrant some explanation. 
Vector graphics are different than raster graphics in the sense that they are created using 
mathematical formulas to form geometric shapes. Unlike raster graphics, vector graphics 
are scalable, meaning they can be enlarged or reduced in size with no image degradation.
However, photographs don’t generally display well as vector-based images. Whereas 
pixel-based images such as digital photos show a transition of color and tone, vector 
graphics are usually composed of areas of solid color (Figure 1-7).
Figure 1-6.  Pixels appear as blocks under close magnification

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
10
In addition to being an advanced photo editing application, Pixlr Editor can also 
serve as graphics creation tool. However, unlike those created using a vector-based 
program, graphics created using this program are pixel-based. The illustration of the city 
scape was created using Pixlr Editor (Figure 1-8).

Image File Formats
Image file formats are standards for storing digital data as a computer file. Each different 
file format is best suited for a specific purpose. Pixlr Editor handles a number of image 
file formats.
Here is a look at the formats Pixlr Editor can work with:
• 
PXD (Pixlr Document)—This is the proprietary file format used 
by Pixlr Editor and should be used to preserve layers for future 
editing or revisions of your project. It’s good practice to always 
keep your work saved as a PXD file, then output a copy of the 
finished of the work in another file format. Pixlr Editor can both 
open and save files in the PXD format.
• 
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)—The JPEG file format 
is one of the most common file formats in use for digital images. 
The JPEG format is versatile because it can compress image data 
for a manageable file size while maintaining good image quality. 
The JPEG format is known as a lossy format. Compressing an 
image discards image data—if an image is compressed too much, 
the quality will suffer. Image files saved in the JPEG format are 
normally used for display on the web. They can also be used for 
print, as long the resolution is sufficient. Pixlr Editor can open and 
save JPEG images.
• 
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)—GIF is another format 
commonly used on the web. Unlike JPEG files, GIF files can 
support transparent backgrounds. This file format is often used 
for simple web animations. Pixlr Editor can open GIF files as 
flattened, static images, but cannot save images as GIF files.
• 
PNG (Portable Network Graphics)—The PNG image file is a 
lossless format. This format provides image data compression 
with little loss of image quality. PNG files are also typically used 
on the web. Unlike JPEG files, PNG files support transparent 
backgrounds. Pixlr Editor can open PNG images and save images 
as PNG files.
• 
BMP (Bitmap Image File)—The BMP is a raster graphics file 
format that is non-destructive. Images are saved in high quality, 
but result in large file sizes. Generally, BMP files are better suited 
for print and not web use. Pixlr Editor can save files in the BMP 
format, and can open most. However, extremely large BMP files 
would likely be an exception.
• 
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)—This is a versatile, widely 
used format used in the graphics industry. Like BMP, this is a 
good choice when image quality is important and destined for 
print rather than web use. Pixlr Editor can save files in the TIFF 
format as flattened images, but can’t open TIFF files.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
12
• 
PSD (Photoshop Document)—This is the default file format 
used by Adobe Photoshop. PSD files often contain layers utilizing 
features unique to Photoshop that aren’t supported in Pixlr Editor. 
Therefore, the application’s ability to handle some PSD files is 
limited. Pixlr Editor can open (with limits) PSD files, but can’t

■Note  It’s important to remember that images hosted on the web (unless they’re in 
the public domain) are protected by copyright laws. It’s always advisable to obtain written 
permission from the copyright owner before using an image hosted on the Internet for 
publication.
Saving Images
Pixlr Editor offers two places to save your images—your computer or the Pixlr Library 
(Figure 1-14).
Figure 1-13.  The image now opened in Pixlr Editor

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of Pixlr Editor
16
A Pixlr account isn’t required to use the application and to save images to your 
computer. Of course, the advantage to having an account is access to the library, thus 
saving space on your computer. The library can serve as a backup of your work if you save 
your images to both places after each editing session.
If you prefer not to set up a Pixlr account, you should always back your work up 
somewhere—on a flash drive, external hard drive, or cloud service.
Your images can be saved in the following file formats using Pixlr Editor (Figure 1-15):
• 
JPEG
• 
PNG
• 
BMP
• 
TIFF
• 
PXD (Pixlr Editor’s native format for using with layered images)

CHAPTER 2
Pixlr Editor Tools
This chapter looks at the broad set of tools at your disposal in Pixlr Editor. Here’s what 
you’ll learn:
• 
The Tool’s Purpose and Function: Each tool’s purpose and how it 
functions is described—an oversized icon representing the tool 
is shown in each figure to help the reader recognize it by sight on 
the toolbar.
• 
Tool Shortcuts: Tool keyboard shortcuts use a single alphabetic 
character and are indicated after the tool’s name in parentheses. 
Once you memorize them, these keyboard shortcuts can 
dramatically reduce the time spent during an editing session.  
Tool shortcuts are included in the descriptions where applicable 
(not all tools have keyboard shortcuts).
• 
Tool Options: Many tools have options available in addition 
to their default settings. These options are described when 
applicable (not all tools have them).
■
■Note   If you’re a complete beginner and would like to try out each tool, there are 
practice images provided (with instructions on PDF) located in the Tools Tryout Guide and 
Practice Images folder, which can be obtained from the Source Code/Downloads tab from 
this Apress page: http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.
The Tools and How They Work
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the tools and describe how they work.
You’ll be using many of these tools as you work through the tutorials in the second 
part of this book, Part II, “Working with Images.”
We will now take a look at each tool—its name, shortcut, description of its purpose, 
and additional options.

The following functions are available from the Image menu:
	
1.	
Image Size―This operation controls the overall dimensions 
of your image. The image dimensions are measured in 
pixels, as shown in Figure 3-12. New values can be entered 
in the Width and Height boxes to change the image size. By 
leaving the Constrain Proportions box checked, the original 
proportions of the image are maintained. Unchecking it will 
result in an image with distorted proportions.
The image size can also be changed by using the slider(s) in 
the Image Size dialog box (Figure 3-13).
	
2.	
Canvas Size―This option controls the overall dimensions 
of the canvas (the background that the image rests on). For 
example, when the canvas width and height is increased by 
100 pixels, it leaves a border around the image (Figure 3-14).
Figure 3-12.  New numeric values can be entered to change the image size
Figure 3-13.  The image size can also be changed by using the slider(s)

Chapter 3 ■ The Pixlr Editor Menu Bar

The Canvas Size dialog box is similar to the Image Size dialog box in respect to 
the Width and Height numeric input boxes and sliders, but it doesn’t have a Constrain 
Proportions feature. It allows the image to be anchored in the center, lower-left, left, 
upper-left, top, upper-right, right, lower-right, and bottom in relation to the canvas 
(Figure 3-15).
	
3.	
Rotate Canvas 180°―Rotates the canvas (including all layers) 
180 degrees, making the image appear upside down

The Filter Menu
The Filter menu consists of 28 functions for applying specialized effects. Some filters have 
useful applications for image correction (such as Blur and Sharpen) that modify focus). 
Others apply artistic, photographic, and fun effects.
Here’s a look at the filters and the effects applied by each one:
	
1.	
Blur―Softens the image focus very slightly. The filter can be 
applied repeatedly to increase the effect.
	
2.	
Box Blur―Softens the image focus based on contrasting areas in 
an image. Some detail may be left in linear areas (Figure 3-46).

Chapter 3 ■ The Pixlr Editor Menu Bar
79
	
3.	
Gaussian Blur―Also used for blurring images (Figure 3-47), 
but softens the image more smoothly than Box Blur. Gaussian 
Blur simulates the effect of viewing the image through a 
translucent screen. The strength of the effect is controlled by 
the slider in the dialog box.
	
4.	
Sharpen―Increases the contrast between neighboring pixels 
to make the image appear slightly sharper. The filter can be 
applied repeatedly to increase the effect.
	
5.	
Unsharp Mask―Offers greater control than the Sharpen 
filter (Figure 3-48). The dialog box uses these three settings to 
achieve the best results possible:
• 
Amount: The percentage of the effect applied.
• 
Radius: The size of the edges to be sharpened.
• 
Threshold: Helps prevent excessive speckling in smooth 
areas.

CHAPTER 4
Composing Images
This chapter looks at making images look their best by using techniques for optimum 
composition. Here’s what you’ll learn:
• 
Start Out by Taking Well Composed Photos: In this portion, we’ll 
take a look at composing the image before the shutter is clicked.
• 
Using the Rule of Thirds: This part provides a basic guide to using 
the “rule of thirds”.
• 
Cropping: In this tutorial, we’ll learn to use the Crop tool 
effectively.
• 
Straightening Crooked Images: In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to 
straighten crooked images using Pixlr Editor.
• 
Correcting Perspective: In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to improve 
an image that suffer from distortion problems.
• 
Standard Photo Print Sizes: Discusses optimal resolution for 
achieving good print results and provides a guide for converting 
width and height measured in pixels to standard print sizes in 
inches.
Start Out by Taking Well Composed Photos
These days, just about everyone has a camera in some form—just think of the countless 
snapshots people capture using smart phones. Many people just point and shoot to 
capture an image on impulse (which can make for great photography, but sometimes that 
just requires good luck).
You can capture an otherwise great picture, but there may be unwanted objects or 
clutter in the background rendering your picture less than ideal. Pixlr Editor is a great tool 
for correcting such problems. However, capturing the image without the distractions and 
clutter will save you a lot of time and effort.
You’ll notice the image on the left in Figure 4-1 has several objects in the background 
making it appear cluttered. Pixlr Editor is a great tool for digitally removing clutter, as 
shown in the image on the right. Of course, using a clutter-free background is always the 
best option when possible. We’ll look at removing objects using Pixlr Editor in Chapter 8.

Chapter 4 ■ Composing Images
100
In Figure 4-2, a different background location was chosen in front of the same house 
(not perfect, but the best available at the location). Because there’s no clutter here, no 
digital cleanup is required, which is a huge time-saver.

101
Using the Rule of Thirds
The “rule of thirds” is a general rule of composition used in photography. It uses a grid 
composed of nine square or rectangular units. The points where the lines intersect are 
used for positioning the elements of main interest.
In Figure 4-3, the image of the lifeguard shack is positioned using the guides—placing 
it off-center creates greater visual interest than if it were placed dead center in the image.
Figure 4-3.  The intersecting points are used to help position elements of interest
Using the rule of thirds as a guide is helpful when composing landscape or seascape 
images. Generally, the horizon line is placed either in the upper or lower third of the grid. 
As you can see in Figure 4-4, the horizon line is positioned near the upper third of the grid 
because the foreground is the primary area of interest. Notice also where the cloud meets 
the peak rests along the left vertical line.
Figure 4-4.  The horizon line is placed near the upper horizontal third of the grid, and 
where the cloud meets the peak is near the left vertical third

Chapter 4 ■ Composing Images
102
The rule of thirds is a useful guide for photographing people as well. In Figure 4-5, 
the man is positioned along the right vertical guideline, with his eyes along the upper 
horizontal guideline.
Figure 4-5.  The rule of thirds is helpful for composing interesting portraits of people
Figure 4-6.  In this image, symmetry trumps the rule of thirds
You may be asking yourself if there are times you wouldn’t use the rule of thirds. 
Like most rules, there are times when it’s better to ignore it. In Figure 4-6, the image of the 
mountains and their reflections calls for symmetry and balance. In this case, using the 
horizontal axis as the guide results in a visually compelling image.

better composition when trimming images.
TUTORIAL 1: CROPPING AN IMAGE
Trimming Away Excess Image Data
Sometimes, you just have to capture a good picture when the opportunity is there. 
Because you have to act quickly, the downside is you might capture unwanted 
objects or people along with it.
In this tutorial, you’ll use the Crop tool to better compose the image following the 
“rule of thirds”.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch04_Little Girl.jpg found in the 
Ch04 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Upon looking at the photo, it’s easy to see that there are feet 
and legs in the background (Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-7.  Legs and feet in the background of the image
3.	
Click the Crop tool or press C on your keyboard.
4.	
Click and drag to orient the picture in a portrait (vertical) format. 
Use the Crop tool’s grid to position as shown in Figure 4-8. The 
little girl should be off-center.

Chapter 4 ■ Composing Images
104
5.	
Once in position, activate the Crop tool by double-clicking in the 
image or pressing Enter on your keyboard.
6.	
Create a new layer (Layer ➤ New Layer) and rename it Clone. 
This is done by double-clicking in the layer thumbnail’s textbox 
(Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-8.  Use the Crop tool’s grid to position as shown
Figure 4-9.  Double-click in the layer’s textbox to rename it

7.	
Click the Clone Stamp tool icon or press the letter S on your 
keyboard. Choose a soft brush between 50-70 pixels in 
diameter.
8.	
Click the Sample All Layers checkbox in the Tool options bar. 
This allows you to clone image data on this separate layer 
rather than directly on the background layer.
9.	
Click the Clone layer to make sure it is active and use the Clone 
Stamp tool to remove the leg, foot, and shadow (Figure 4-10).
Figure 4-10.  Use the Clone Stamp tool to remove the legs and feet in the background
10.	
Clone on the left side to remove the foot next to the little girl.
11.	
Figure 4-11 shows the before and after comparison. When 
finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a 
PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher 
may instruct you to save the image by a certain name and in a 
certain location (such as a flash drive).

Chapter 4 ■ Composing Images
106
TUTORIAL 2: STRAIGHTENING AN IMAGE
Use Free Transform to Correct a Crooked Image
The Free Transform function is very useful for straightening images with a tilt. In this 
tutorial, we’ll correct an image of an old church.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch04_Church.jpg found in the Ch04 
Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Activate the Free Transform function (Edit ➤ Free transform, or 
press Control+T) and position the cursor around the upper-right 
corner of the image until a curved arrow icon appears.
4.	
Click and drag, moving the duplicate layer slightly clockwise 
until the eave of the roof is level (Figure 4-12).

using the layer thumbnail’s textbox.
6.	
Click the Clone Stamp tool icon or press the letter S on your 
keyboard. Check the Sample All Layers option.
7.	
Choose a soft brush between 50-70 pixels in diameter.
8.	
When the layer was straightened, some of the background layer 
became visible and is noticeable (like a seam).
9.	
Clone the areas indicated in the upper left and right to make a 
smooth transition, as well as the partial image of the car (left side) 
and the area in the lower-left corner (Figure 4-13).
Figure 4-12.  Rotate the layer slightly until level

TUTORIAL 3: CORRECTING PERSPECTIVE
Use Free Distort to Correct an Image with Perspective Problems
The Free Distort function can be useful for correcting images that suffer from 
camera lens distortion or perspective issues.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch04_Perspective Correction.jpg 
found in the Ch04 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Activate the Free Distort function (Edit ➤ Free Distort).
4.	
Drag the upper corners of the bounding box to the positions 
shown in Figure 4-15.
5.	
Nudge the lower-right corner of the bounding box down very 
slightly (Figure 4-16).

Printing Standard Photo Sizes
Pixlr Editor was designed to output images for digital display, but it is possible to output 
them to your inkjet printer or have your local photo lab print them.
However, it’s important to work with an image of sufficient resolution. How much is 
enough? An image opened from a URL will likely be too small to obtain a good print from. If 
you scan photos with a flatbed scanner, scan at least at a setting of 300 PPI (pixels per inch).  
If you’re starting with a small original and plan to print it larger, use your scanner’s 
software to enlarge it to the desired target size.
Generally, transparencies such as slides and negatives must be scanned at higher 
resolutions than photographs when they are to be printed.
Most modern digital cameras capture 16 megapixels at least, providing enough data 
for good prints (when using the highest quality setting).
■
■Note  When outputting images as JPEG files using Pixlr Editor, it’s a good idea to set the 
quality at 100% before saving.
Because an image opened in Pixlr Editor is measured in pixels, I’ve provided a guide 
to help convert from pixels to inches (Table 4-1).

Summary
This chapter covered several basic techniques for achieving good image composition. 
Paying attention to the background while composing the image can eliminate clutter that 
might have to be digitally removed later. The “rule of thirds” is a widely accepted guide for 
making images more interesting.
The tutorials showed how to crop an image to make it look its best, use Free 
Transform to correct a crooked image, and use Free Distort to correct an image with 
perspective distortion.
This chapter also touched on the fact that to print an image, it’s important to make 
sure it has sufficient resolution. A guide converting dimensions from pixels to several 
standard print sizes is provided.
The next chapter covers using a variety of ways to correct image tonality.

CHAPTER 5
Improving Image Tonality
This chapter looks at correcting problems such as poor contrast and exposure issues. 
Here's what will be covered:
• 
Common Tonal Problems: In this part, we'll look at the most 
common tonal problems in photographic images.
• 
Using the Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: In this part, we'll 
take a look at how to improve tonality using this tool.
• 
Using Exposure: In this part, we look at how using the Exposure 
adjustment improves a dark, underexposed image.
• 
The Levels Adjustment: The Levels dialog box is a powerful  
(and fairly complex) tool used for image tonality adjustments. 
This part takes a close look at how it works.
• 
The Curves Adjustment: The Curves dialog box is another 
powerful, complex tool used for image tonality adjustments. This 
part takes a close look at how it works.
• 
Improving Exposure Using Layer Modes: This section looks at how 
image exposure can be improved by using two different layer 
blending modes.
• 
Local Tonal Adjustments Using the Dodge and Burn Tools: This 
section looks at how image tonality can be improved in parts of an 
image using these tools.

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
116
Common Tonal Problems
Tonal problems are very common not only in casual photography, but in older images 
that have degraded over time. In many cases, a simple quick fix is all that's needed to 
correct the image. In other cases, you'll need to use more powerful adjustments such as 
Levels or Curves.
Tonal problems usually fall under one of the following descriptions:
• 
Low contrast (dull and flat)
• 
Underexposed (too dark)
• 
Mixed tonality (good exposure in some areas, poor exposure  
in others)
• 
Overexposed (too bright)
The rest of this chapter shows you various methods describing how to correct these 
issues using the adjustments (tutorials accompany some of them).
Using the Brightness & Contrast Adjustment 
Dialog Box
Tonal problems are very common not only in casual photography, but in older images 
that have degraded over time. In many cases, a simple quick fix is all that's needed to 
correct the image.
■
■Note  Just as you would compose an image in the best way possible before clicking the 
shutter button, it's also a good practice to follow your camera's user manual guidelines on 
how to achieve the best exposure before shooting the picture.

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
117
The Brightness & Contrast adjustment is a basic tonal correction tool designed for 
making quick corrections. It doesn't offer the precise control found in the Levels and 
Curves dialog boxes, but will work well for many types of images with contrast problems. 
The image shown in Figure 5-1 is washed out and lacking in contrast.
Figure 5-1.  This image is lacking in contrast

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
118
Using the Exposure Adjustment Dialog Box
The Exposure adjustment is a useful function for making quick improvements in 
underexposed images. The inside of an old church turned out underexposed in this 
image (Figure 5-3).
Now the image is opened in Pixlr Editor, and by using the Brightness & Contrast 
dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Brightness & Contrast), the image is improved by setting the 
Brightness to -15 and the Contrast to 35 (Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2.  The tonal quality of this image is improved using the Brightness & Contrast 
adjustment

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
119
Figure 5-3.  The image of this old church is underexposed
Figure 5-4.  The Exposure adjustment quickly improves this underexposed image
By setting Exposure adjustment to 30, the image is quickly improved, and more 
detail is revealed (Figure 5-4). The Exposure adjustment ranges from 0-50.

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
120
The Levels Adjustment Dialog Box
The Levels dialog box allows you to make an image lighter or darker, or to change the 
contrast. It offers more precise control than the Brightness & Contrast adjustment. Color 
corrections can also be made using Levels, which we'll look at in detail Chapter 6.
The Levels dialog box displays a histogram, which is a graphical representation of the 
pixel brightness values ranging from 0 (pure black) to 255 (pure white).
The tonal information of the black and white (grayscale) image of the car is mapped 
in the histogram shown in Figure 5-5. All of the darkest pixels are contained in the left 
portion of the histogram, the middle range pixels are in the center portion, and the 
lightest pixels are in the right portion.
Figure 5-5.  The tonal information of this image is mapped in the histogram
TUTORIAL 4: TONAL CORRECTION USING LEVELS
Improving Contrast in a Dull Image
The Levels adjustment is very useful for correcting tonality in images. In this tutorial, 
Levels will be used to remap the tonality to improve the contrast in a dull and flat 
image.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch05_Lady and Baby.jpg found in the 
Ch05 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Contrast Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
121
4.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Levels). Note that 
most of the tonal information is clustered in the midtones range 
of the histogram―the dark and light ranges are lacking.
5.	
In the Input Levels window, move the left black point slider 
toward the center where the histogram data begins―repeat 
this process moving the right white point slider toward the 
histogram data (Figure 5-6). Click OK when you’re done.
Now the image is has much better contrast, as seen in the before and after 
comparison (Figure 5-7). When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or 
save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you 
to save the image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Figure 5-6.  Moving the black and white point sliders remaps the tonality in the image to 
improve contrast
Figure 5-7.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
122
Using the Levels Mid Point Slider
In the previous tutorial, the contrast was improved by using the black point and white 
point sliders to remap the tonality. These sliders make adjustments to the darkest and 
lightest ranges in the image.
The mid point slider (also called the gamma slider) is useful for revealing detail in 
images that are moderately underexposed. The mid point slider produces results similar 
to those that the Exposure adjustment dialog box does.
TUTORIAL 5: EXPOSURE CORRECTION USING LEVELS
Improving an Underexposed Image
This tutorial involves only a couple of slight adjustments, but they make a noticeable 
difference.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch05_Little Grand Canyon.jpg found 
in the Ch05 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Exposure Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Levels). Note that 
most of the tonal information is clustered in the darker range of 
the histogram.
5.	
In the Input Levels window, move the white point slider toward the 
point where the histogram data begins (the numeric value should read 
243). Move the mid point slider slightly to the left until the numeric 
value reads 0.8 (Figure 5-8). Click OK when you’re done.
Figure 5-8.  Making a slight exposure correction using the white point and mid point sliders

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
123
Now the image is a bit lighter—note a little more detail is revealed in the darker areas 
of the image (Figure 5-9). When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or 
save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you 
to save the image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
The Curves Adjustment Dialog Box
The Curves dialog box is a powerful function that allows you to make precision 
adjustments in your image. Depending on the type of adjustment being made, the 
diagonal line is moved in specific areas, or parts of the line can be anchored to prevent 
changes in certain parts of the image (Figure 5-10).
Figure 5-9.  Before and after comparison
Figure 5-10.  Adjustments are made by moving the diagonal line in specific areas

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
124
By default, the histogram is not shown, but you can display it by checking the 
Histogram option box (which I recommend, since the histogram is a “map” of the tonal 
information).
TUTORIAL 6: TONAL CORRECTION USING CURVES
Improving Contrast in a Dull Image
In this tutorial, the contrast of a tonally flat image will be boosted with a commonly 
used method in the world of image editing known as an “S” curve.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch05_Flat Cat.jpg found in the Ch05 
Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Contrast Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Curves). Check the 
Histogram option box.
5.	
Note that most of the tonal information is clustered in the mid 
range area of the histogram.
6.	
Click in the center of the grid to place an anchor point (Figure 5-11).  
Do not click OK just yet.
Figure 5-11.  Click the center to place an anchor point

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
125
7.	
Now, place points on the line and move as shown in Figure 5-12 
(note that it bears a slight resemblance to the letter “S”). Click 
OK when you’re done.
■
■Note  The purpose of this tutorial is to get you accustomed to making manual 
adjustments using Curves. However, there is an Increase Contrast setting in the Curves 
presets. Some of the Curves presets will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6.
Now the contrast is boosted and the image is improved (Figure 5-13). When you’re 
finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. 
If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name 
and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).

TUTORIAL 7: PARTIAL EXPOSURE CORRECTION  
USING CURVES
Improving an Image with Mixed Tonality
In this tutorial, Curves will be used to create a fill flash effect. It will lighten the 
harsh, darker areas of the image while not affecting the lighter areas.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch05_Hiker at Rest.jpg found in the 
Ch05 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Exposure Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Curves). Check the 
Histogram option box. Note that most of the tonal information is 
clustered in the mid range and dark range areas of the histogram.
5.	
Place anchor points along the line, as shown in Figure 5-14. 
This will “lock down” the pixels in the lighter-to-lightest range 
of the image. Do not click OK just yet.
Figure 5-14.  Placing this anchor point “locks down” the light to lightest pixels

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
127
Figure 5-15.  Making this adjustment reduces the harsher dark areas
6.	
Click on the line and pull upward to form a bow shape, as shown in  
Figure 5-15. Click OK when you’re done.
The effect reduces the harsh shadows, while keeping the lighter areas from washing 
out (Figure 5-16). When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as 
a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save 
the image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Figure 5-16.  Before and after comparison

128
■
■Note  In the next chapter, we'll look at the commands (represented by eyedropper  
icons in the Curves dialog box) to set the white, gray, and black points for color-correcting 
an image.
Improving Exposure Using Layer Modes
Using layer modes (particularly Multiply and Screen) can be useful for quickly correcting 
images that are overexposed or underexposed.
Figure 5-17 is an example of a slightly overexposed image.
Figure 5-17.  A slightly overexposed scenic image

Chapter 5 ■ Improving Image Tonality
129
By duplicating the background layer and changing the mode to Multiply, the image 
is much less washed out. The layer’s opacity was lowered to 80% to achieve the result 
shown in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18.  The overexposed image corrected using the Multiply layer mode
TUTORIAL 8: EXPOSURE CORRECTION USING THE 
SCREEN LAYER MODE
Improving an Underexposed Image
Just as using the Multiply layer mode improved the overexposed image, the Screen

The exposure of this image now looks more like it should (Figure 5-21). When 
you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file 
for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save 
the image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Local Tonal Adjustments Using the Dodge and 
Burn Tools
Some images might need tonal corrections only in specific (or local) areas. The Dodge 
and Burn tools are used for this purpose. As shown in Figure 5-22, the Dodge tool is being 
used to lighten the opening in the brick wall, revealing some detail.

Using the Burn tool in the hazy area now makes the image look more evened out 
(Figure 5-24). When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a 
PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the 
image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Summary
This chapter covered several methods for correcting tonal problems. The Brightness 
& Contrast adjustment dialog box is a basic tool that works well in many cases, but 
has limits. The Exposure adjustment dialog box is a quick method for improving 
underexposed images.
The Levels and Curves adjustment dialog boxes (while being more complex) offer 
more control in the tonal adjustments being made.
The Multiply and Screen layer modes can be used to improve images that are 
overexposed or underexposed, respectively.
The Dodge and Burn tools are used to make local tonal adjustments.
The next chapter covers a variety of color correction methods.

CHAPTER 6
Color Adjustments
This chapter looks at several methods of adjusting and correcting color, and several 
Curves presets for creative effects.
• 
The RGB Color Model and Color Channels: This part briefly 
looks at the RGB color model (which Pixlr Editor uses) and color 
channels.
• 
Using the Color Balance Adjustment Dialog Box: In this part, we’ll 
look at correcting a color imbalance using this dialog box.
• 
Using the Levels Adjustment Dialog Box: In this part, we’ll look at 
restoring faded colors by using Levels on each color channel.
• 
Using the Curves Adjustment: In this part, we’ll look at making a 
color correction using Curves.
• 
Using the Curves Presets: This part looks at the Curves presets, 
used for making quick tonal changes, and color adjustments for 
artistic effect.
The RGB Color Model and Color Channels
Before moving on to the tutorial (in which some of the adjustments will be a bit more 
involved), let’s learn a little bit about the RGB color model and color channels. Pixlr Editor 
uses the RGB color model, which mixes red, green, and blue light in various amounts to 
create a broad array of colors that are displayed on your monitor. When red, green, and 
blue light is combined at 100%, the result is white (Figure 6-1). Conversely, when there is 
zero percentage of each, black is the result.

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
136
An image displayed on your monitor in the RGB color model is comprised of three 
channels; one red, one green, and one blue. Put in its simplest terms, channels are 
essentially storage containers for the lightness value information of each color (Figure 6-2). 
The examples shown have been converted to grayscale for easier viewing.
It’s making adjustments in one or more color channels that alters the image’s look. 
This is usually done indirectly by using the various adjustment functions Pixlr Editor has 
to offer. However, the Levels and Curves adjustments provide more direct control over 
each channel (we’ll see an example of using Levels for this purpose in Tutorial 11 coming 
up a little later).
Using the Color Balance Adjustment Dialog Box
An image with a color cast (excessive tint of an undesired color) can often be easily 
corrected with this adjustment. It works by increasing more of the (unwanted) color’s 
opposite, thus balancing it out. Figure 6-3 shows the Color Balance dialog box, and the 
corresponding colors and their opposites, which is controlled by using the sliders.
Figure 6-1.  Red, green, and blue light combined at 100% results in white
Figure 6-2.  Color channels store lightness value information of each color

TUTORIAL 10: COLOR CORRECTION USING COLOR 
BALANCE
Removing a Color Cast
In this tutorial, we’ll use the Color Balance dialog box to correct an image with a blue 
color cast that resulted from poor processing by the film lab.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch06_Mr.Cash.jpg found in the Ch06 
Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Color Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Color Balance dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Color 
Balance).
5.	
Move the Blue offset slider to the left until the numerical reading 
is -30 (Figure 6-4). This increases the yellow, offsetting the 
excess blue tint.
Figure 6-3.  The Color Balance dialog box corrects a color cast by increasing more of the 
unwanted color’s opposite

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
138
Now, the blue tint is removed and the colors are more balanced (Figure 6-5). When 
you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future 
reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a 
certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Using the Levels Adjustment Dialog box
A common problem that affects older color photographs is the reduction of vibrance due 
to the dyes fading and shifting over time. Provided the dyes haven’t faded too much, the 
Levels dialog box can be very useful for correcting this problem.
Figure 6-4.  Moving the Blue offset slider to the left increases the yellow

TUTORIAL 11: COLOR RESTORATION USING LEVELS
Restoring Faded Colors Image Using Levels on Each Color 
Channel
This tutorial involves adjustments made to each color channel to achieve the final 
result.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch06_Girl Gone Fishing.jpg found in 
the Ch06 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Color Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Levels).
5.	
Click the triangle to the right of the Channel option dialog box. 
Scroll down to highlight the red channel (Figure 6-6). Do not 
click OK just yet.
Figure 6-6.  Highlight the Red channel option

6.	
Move the black point slider toward the center, stopping where 
the histogram data begins. Repeat this step with the white point 
slider (Figure 6-7). Do not click OK just yet.
7.	
Click the triangle again to open the Channel option dialog  
box—scroll down to highlight the green channel (Figure 6-8). 
Do not click OK just yet.

Click the triangle again to open the Channel option dialog box—
scroll down to highlight the blue channel (Figure 6-10). Do not 
click OK just yet.
10.	
Move the black point slider toward the center, stopping where 
the histogram data begins. Repeat this step with the white point 
slider (Figure 6-11). Click the OK button when you’re done.
Figure 6-10.  Highlighting the Blue channel

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
143
Now that the tonality of each color channel has been adjusted, the colors of the 
image are more vibrant, and the contrast is improved (Figure 6-12). When you’re finished, 
either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are 
a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name and in a 
certain location (such as a flash drive).

Using the Curves Adjustment Dialog Box
In the previous chapter, the Curves dialog box was used for making tonal corrections.  
In the upcoming tutorial, it will be used to make a tonal and color correction.
TUTORIAL 12: SETTING THE GRAY POINT USING CURVES
Removing a Color Cast Using Curves—Finishing with the 
Sponge Tool and Unsharp Mask
In this tutorial, the image has a predominate magenta color cast, with a bit of excess 
blue in the penguins. We’ll correct this by setting the gray point using the middle 
eyedropper option in the Curves dialog box.
Then, we’ll apply the finishing touches using the Sponge tool and Unsharp mask.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch06_Penguins.jpg found in the Ch06 
Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Color Fix using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Adjustment ➤ Curves). Check the 
Histogram option box.
5.	
Click the middle (gray point) eyedropper icon.
6.	
Click in the target area indicated a few times (Figure 6-13). The 
goal is to achieve a result close to the one shown in the middle 
panel, so this may take repeated attempts. Rather than close 
the Curves dialog box (only to relaunch it), reset it to Default in 
the Presets options to start over. Click OK when you’re done.

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
145
■
■Note  Ideally, the green channel’s adjustment curve should bow upward slightly 
(increasing green to offset the magenta), and the blue adjustment curve should bow 
downward slightly (increasing yellow to offset the blue). Your results may vary slightly, but if 
the image is close to the one shown, it should suffice.
7.	
The penguin on the right still has a tinge of blue. Click the 
Sponge tool icon or press the letter P on your keyboard.
8.	
From the Brush options dialog box, select the soft, 200 pixel 
diameter brush.
9.	
Select the Desaturate option and set the strength to 9-10.
10.	
Brush along the wing, as shown in Figure 6-14, to reduce the 
blue tinge.
Figure 6-13.  Set the gray point by using the middle eyedropper option and sampling the 
area indicated in the left panel
Figure 6-14.  Use the Sponge tool to reduce the blue tinge

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
146
11.	
Because the picture was taken through a glass window, the 
clarity may have been slightly diminished. Open the Unsharp 
Mask filter (Filter ➤ Unsharp Mask).
12.	
Set the Amount to 110 and the Radius to 3 (leave the Threshold 
on the default setting of 15). This will sharpen the image just 
slightly (Figure 6-15).
13.	
Click OK when you’re finished.
The image now looks more color-balanced and crisper (Figure 6-16).
Figure 6-16.  Before and after comparison
Figure 6-15.  The Unsharp Mask filter sharpens the image slightly

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
147
When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file 
for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image 
with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
■
■Note   The eyedropper options in Curves are used to expand the tonal range in your 
image by setting the black, gray, or white points. It takes some experimentation, but in my 
experience setting the gray point works well most color correction situations.
The Curves Presets
There are a number of presets available to you in the Curves adjustment dialog box. Some 
make tonal changes, while others primarily affect color.
• 
Default—Used to apply manual changes (Figure 6-17).
• 
Invert—Reverses the colors and lightness values (Figure 6-18).
Figure 6-17.  The Default preset

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
148
• 
Colder—Slightly increases blue and green, giving the image a cool 
tone (Figure 6-19).
• 
Warmer—Slightly increases red and yellow, giving the image a 
warm tone (Figure 6-20).
Figure 6-18.  The Invert preset

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
149
• 
Increase Contrast—Automatically creates an S curve, boosting the 
contrast (Figure 6-21).
• 
Decrease Contrast—Automatically creates a “reverse S curve,” 
creating a flatter tone (Figure 6-22).
Figure 6-20.  The Warmer preset

Chapter 6 ■ Color Adjustments
150
• 
Darken Shadows—Automatically darkens the dark to black range 
of pixels (Figure 6-23).
• 
Chillauto—Increases blue and slightly increases green and cyan 
for a cool tone (Figure 6-24).

• 
Cross Process—Mentioned in the Adjustments section of Chapter 3, 
this mimics the technique of purposely processing one film type using 
a photographic chemical intended for another film type (Figure 6-25).
• 
These are just the first nine presets—if you scroll further down 
you’ll discover many more (Figure 6-26).

Summary
This chapter described several techniques for correcting and adjusting color. We first 
covered (very briefly) how RGB images are comprised of red, green, and blue light. Color 
channels are essentially storage containers for lightness value information for each color.
The Color Balance adjustment works by increasing the offending color’s opposite to 
balance it out (such as a blue color cast being corrected by increasing yellow).
The Levels dialog was used to adjust each color channel to restore the vibrance to a 
faded color image.
The Curves dialog was used to set the gray point of an image with a magenta color 
cast. The Sponge tool was used to reduce the blue tinge in a local area, and the Unsharp 
Mask filter was used to sharpen the image slightly.
Lastly, we looked at the various tonal and color adjustments available from the 
Curves presets.
The next chapter looks at retouching and repairing photos using Pixlr Editor.

CHAPTER 7
Photo Retouching and 
Repair
Pictures quite often have flaws that digital correction can drastically improve. In some 
cases, the culprit are imperfections such as red eye or skin blemishes. Other times, the 
photo may have incurred physical damage over time. This chapter looks at techniques for 
retouching and repairing flawed and damaged images. Here’s what we’ll cover:
• 
Red Eye Correction: This part looks at the Red Eye Reduction tool 
and how it works its magic
• 
Touching Up Blemishes Using the Spot Heal Tool: In this part, we’ll 
see how effective this tool is for clearing up facial blemishes.
• 
Repairing Damage Using the Spot Heal and Clone Stamp Tools: 
In this part, we’ll tackle repairing an image that has sustained a 
collection of scratches, punctures, and creases over time.
• 
Reducing Digital Noise: In this part, you’ll see how images with 
excessive noise can be improved.
Red Eye Correction
Everyone has seen them—those demon-like red eyes that become that can spoil an 
otherwise good picture. Red eye is caused by the camera’s flash reflected off the retina of 
the eye when the picture is taken in ambient light (the pupils are open wide, allowing a 
large amount of light to enter). The red color is the result of blood-rich choroid, which is 
connective tissue that lies behind the retina.
Fortunately, the Red Eye Reduction tool can quickly come to the rescue. In most 
cases, it works fine by itself. However, it only does what the name implies—reduces the 
effect without completely fixing it. Sometimes, the red eye effect is severe enough to 
require several extra steps and tools to end up with more natural results, as you’ll see 
shortly.

TUTORIAL 13: RED EYE CORRECTION
Correcting Severe Red Eye Using Multiple Tools
In this tutorial, we’ll correct an image of a little boy with severe red eye.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch07_Red Eye.jpg found in the Ch07 
Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
3.	
Click the Red Eye Reduction tool icon.
4.	
Click in the center of each eye in the duplicate layer. I used 
the default tolerance setting of 50%, but you can increase this 
slightly if needed (Figure 7-1).
■
■Note  After applying the tool, the eyes look much better (and we could stop here and call 
it finished), but there are several steps we can take to make them look more natural—let’s 
continue.

5.	
We’ll need to make a couple of local tonal adjustments in the 
child’s left eye. Click the Burn tool icon or press the letter N on 
your keyboard.
6.	
Select the soft, 25-pixel diameter brush from the presets and 
leave the Range and Exposure at their default settings.
7.	
Brush the lighter part of the left eye until it matches the darker 
outer portion (Figure 7-2).
8.	
Now we need to lighten the iris portion of the eyes (the outer 
area surrounding the pupils). Click the Dodge tool icon or press 
the letter O on your keyboard.
9.	
Select the soft, 15-pixel diameter brush from the presets and 
change the Range to Shadows and Exposure to 20.
10.	
Brush around the pupils to lighten the iris, as shown in Figure 7-3.

158
The final result should be close to that shown in Figure 7-6. As mentioned, in many 
cases the Red Eye Reduction tool will suffice without extra measures, but when it doesn’t, 
you’ll now know how to handle those extreme cases of the red eye effect.

When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file 
for future reference.
If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain 
name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Touching Up Blemishes
Touching up images with facial blemishes is a very common service provided by 
professional photographers and retouch artists. Pixlr Editor has a powerful weapon to 
use against blemishes (at least in photographic images), and that is the Spot Heal tool, as 
you’ll see in the lesson that follows.
TUTORIAL 14: BLEMISH TOUCH UP
Removing Blemishes Using the Spot Heal Tool
In this tutorial, we’ll remove quickly remove the largest, most obvious blemishes 
using the Spot Heal tool.
1.	
Open the image titled Ch07_Great Grandpa.jpg found in the 
Ch07 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer).
Figure 7-6.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 7 ■ Photo Retouching and Repair
160
3.	
Rename the duplicate layer Heal Layer using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Click the Spot Heal tool icon, set the brush diameter to about  
20 pixels, and make sure the Blend Nearby option is checked.
5.	
Zoom in close enough to view comfortably. Starting at the top of 
the head, click over the larger blemishes (Figure 7-7). They should 
disappear seamlessly, but if not undo the step and try again.
■
■Note  The brush size should be only slightly larger than the blemish, so adjust as 
needed.
Figure 7-7.  Use the Spot Heal tool starting at the top of the head

161
7.	
As you’re working, zoom out occasionally to monitor your 
progress (Figure 7-9). Toggle the duplicate layer’s visibility off 
and on to compare the original to the work in progress.
Figure 7-8.  Work downward along the face
6.	
Work down along the side of the face, as shown in Figure 7-8.

Chapter 7 ■ Photo Retouching and Repair
162
The end result should resemble that shown in Figure 7-10. As you can see, the Spot 
Heal tool is extremely useful. When you’re finished, either close the image without saving 
or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct 
you to save the image with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).

163
Removing Scratches and Damage
Repairing damage is another popular service provided by retouch artists. In the 
forthcoming lesson, we’ll repair a photo that has incurred some damage over time 
because of poor storage practices. We’ll be using both the Spot Heal and Clone Stamp 
tools for this assignment.
TUTORIAL 15: REMOVING SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE
Repairing a Photo Using the Spot Heal Tool and  
the Clone Stamp Tool
Although the Spot Heal tool is generally used for removing skin imperfections, it can 
be used for repairing scratches and other types of damage. The downside is that it 
doesn’t always work (it largely depends on the image content). In instances when it 
doesn’t work, the Clone Stamp tool can take over, as you’ll soon see.
■
■Note  It’s a good idea to review the Clone Stamp tool section of the supplemental Tools 
Tryout Guide and Practice Images folder, which can be obtained from the Source Code/
Downloads tab from this Apress page: http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.

1.	
Open the image titled Ch07_Scratched Riverboat Ride.jpg 
found in the Ch07 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer) and 
rename it Heal Layer using the layer thumbnail’s textbox.
3.	
Create a new layer (Layer ➤ New Layer). Rename the layer 
Clone Layer using the layer’s textbox. (It won’t be used just 
yet, so click the duplicate background layer to make it active.)
4.	
Click the Spot Heal tool icon, set the brush diameter to about 30 
pixels, and make sure the Blend Nearby option is checked.
5.	
Remove the three puncture marks on the Heal Layer layer 
(Figure 7-11) using the Spot Heal tool.
6.	
Use the Spot Heal tool on the scratches (indicated in yellow) 
shown in Figure 7-12 on the Heal Layer. The default brush 
diameter is 10 pixels—if necessary, increase the diameter 
slightly.
Figure 7-11.  Remove the puncture marks shown

7.	
Click the Clone Layer to activate it.
8.	
Click the Clone Stamp tool icon or press the letter S on your 
keyboard. Make sure the Sample All Layers option is checked.
9.	
Repair the areas indicated in blue using the Clone Stamp tool. 
Be sure to re-sample often (Control+Click) as you work to avoid 
repeating patterns.
■
■Note  Using the Spot Heal tool in one stroke over areas with distinctive tonal differences 
(such as where the shadow of the bench and the sunlit deck surface meet) usually ends up 
with smudged results. That’s the purpose of using the Clone Stamp tool in those transitional 
areas.
10.	
Continue the process, working upward, as shown in Figure 7-13. 
Be sure to activate the corresponding layer when switching 
from one tool to another.
Figure 7-12.  Use the Spot Heal tool on the areas indicated in yellow

12.	
Choose the soft, 9-pixel diameter brush from the presets and 
finish by removing the remaining specks and dust (Figure 7-15).
■
■Note  Be sure to zoom in and look all around the image using the Navigator to make 
sure everything is cleaned up.
When you’re finished, the result is an image that looks almost new (Figure 7-16). 
This type of work is time consuming, but can work wonders when repairing damaged 
photos—the key to making undetectable repairs is practice. When you’re finished, either 
close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a 
student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name in and a 
certain location (such as a flash drive).

168
Reducing Image Noise
Image noise is an undesirable by-product that has a gritty appearance. It usually results 
from from taking pictures in low light situations. Pixlr Editor’s Denoise Filter helps 
smooth the image’s appearance. The Denoise Filter is a “one shot” filter—it does not 
offer a dialog box with additional options, but it can be applied repeatedly. However, its 
effectiveness will be limited on images with excessive noise.

This process won’t magically turn a poor quality, noisy image into a beautiful photo, 
but it will improve it to some extent (Figure 7-18). When you’re finished, either close the 
image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, your 
teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name and in a certain location 
(such as a flash drive).
Summary
This chapter described several techniques for retouching and improving images with 
various imperfections.
The Red Eye Reduction tool is very useful for correcting the red eye effect caused by 
the camera flash. As you learned in the tutorial, in some cases extra steps are necessary to 
make the eyes look more natural.
In the tutorial featuring the elderly man holding his great-grandchild, the Spot Heal 
tool was used to remove the blemishes from his face.
Next, both the Spot Heal tool and the Clone Stamp tool were used to repair and clean 
up an image damaged by scratches, a tear, a crease, and dust specks.
The last thing we covered was using the Denoise filter to improve the appearance of 
an image with excessive digital noise.
The next chapter covers altering images by digitally removing unwanted elements 
and replacing backgrounds.

CHAPTER 8
Removing/Adding Elements  
and Background 
Replacement
In Chapter 4, we learned the importance of composing a good image before snapping the 
picture. When this rule is practiced, it can eliminate the need to make digital alterations 
that could have been avoided.
Of course, sometimes these situations can’t always be avoided•when they can’t, Pixlr 
Editor can be used to modify the image.
In this chapter, we’ll learn the following:
• 
Removing Unwanted Elements: In this part, we’ll learn how to 
improve an image by removing unnecessary objects.
• 
Adding Elements: In this part, we’ll digitally add a second bird to 
the image being worked with throughout this chapter.
• 
Background Replacement: This part will demonstrate how to 
switch a so-so background to one with more appeal.
Removing Unwanted Elements
In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to remove some distracting objects from an image.
TUTORIAL 17: REMOVING DISTRACTING ELEMENTS
Borrowing Image Data to Cover Unwanted Objects
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1.	
Open the image titled Ch08_Macaw.jpg found in the Ch08 
Practice Images folder.

2.	
Click the Lasso tool icon (or press L on your keyboard).
3.	
Set the Feather radius to 15 in the tool options bar. This will help 
the copied image data of the foliage to blend in better.
4.	
Make a selection around some of the foliage just above the 
feeder (Figure 8-1).
5.	
Copy (choose Edit ➤ Copy) and paste (Edit ➤ Paste) the 
selected area to a new layer.
6.	
Click the Move tool icon, then move the copied image data over 
the feeder (Figure 8-2).

Make sure the Sample All Layers option is checked.
9.	
Select the soft, round brush with a 150-pixel diameter from the 
presets.
10.	
Use the Clone Stamp tool to blend the foliage and cover up 
any obvious gaps, repeating patterns, etc. It should resemble 
the example shown in Figure 8-3. Make sure no excess image 
data is covering the bird’s body—if it is, use the Eraser tool to 
remove it.

Figure 8-8 shows the before and after comparison. When you’re finished, either close 
the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a student, 
your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name and in a certain 
location (such as a flash drive).
Adding Elements
I thought it might be nice to give our macaw friend a companion to keep him company. 
In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to add a bird from another photo.
TUTORIAL 18: ADDING ELEMENTS
The Addition of a Second Bird from a Different Source Image
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1.	
Open the image titled Ch08_Macaw (Edited).jpg found in 
the Ch08 Practice Images folder (this version will resemble 
the result from the previous tutorial with the post and feeder 
removed).
2.	
Open the image titled Ch08_Cockatoo.jpg found in the Ch08 
Practice Images folder as a layer (Layer ➤ Open Image as 
Layer).
3.	
The image of the cockatoo now exists as a layer over the 
background layer. Using the Toggle Layer Settings dialog box, 
lower the opacity of the imported layer to 50%—this will help 
make it easier to move into position.
Figure 8-8.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
178
4.	
Rename the layer Cockatoo using the layer thumbnail’s textbox 
and move it into the position indicated in Figure 8-9 using the 
Move tool.
5.	
Restore the layer’s opacity to 100% using the Toggle Layer 
Settings dialog box.
6.	
Add a layer mask using the Toggle Layer Settings dialog box 
(the Cockatoo layer will seem to disappear, but it’s still there).
■
■Note  Layer masks are discussed in greater detail in The Beginner’s Guide to Layers 
PDF, which can be obtained from the Source Code/Downloads tab from this Apress page: 
http://www.apress.com/9781484226971.
7.	
Click the Brush tool icon (or press B on your keyboard). Select 
the hard, 200-pixel diameter brush from the presets.
Figure 8-9.  Use the Move tool to position the Cockatoo layer as indicated here

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
179
8.	
Click the layer mask to make it active (indicated by a red 
border) and paint to reveal the cockatoo (Figure 8-10). Don’t 
worry about the pixels outside of the bird being revealed—that 
will be dealt with shortly.
■
■Note  As you paint in the layer mask, each stroke is indicated by a green overlay. When 
the mouse button is released, the overlay disappears and the portion of the image the stroke 
covered is revealed.
9.	
After the cockatoo is revealed, we need to hide the fringe 
(excess) image data around it. Click the Eraser tool icon  
(or press E on your keyboard).
10.	
Select a small brush 30-50 pixels in diameter. Set the hardness 
to 70%.
11.	
Zoom in using the Navigator and work along the edge carefully 
to restore the mask, hiding the excess image data around the 
cockatoo (Figure 8-11). 
Figure 8-10.  Paint in the layer mask to reveal the cockatoo

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
180
12.	
After working along the entire edge, switch to a larger brush to 
remove the larger areas.
13.	
Look over the entire layer closely to make sure there aren’t any 
stray (or missing) pixels.
Figure 8-12 shows the before and after comparison. When you’re finished, either 
close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a 
student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name and in a 
certain location (such as a flash drive).

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
181
Background Replacement
Sometimes, images can be improved by using a different background. In the upcoming 
tutorial, we’ll replace a plain light background (which is actually a wall) and replace it 
with something more stylish.
In many cases, using a layer mask as we did in the previous tutorial will work fine. 
If the subject has a smooth outline, then it’s usually fairly easy to paint the subject into a 
new background and use the Eraser tool to remove the excess image data.
However, putting images of people on a different background can sometimes be 
challenging. For example, not everyone has straight, smooth hair and isolating curly hair 
can be difficult.
Fortunately, the method used in the upcoming lesson can deal with that issue easily. 
It might not work in every scenario, but it works well in high-contrast images with light 
backgrounds.
TUTORIAL 19: BACKGROUND REPLACEMENT
Replacing a Wall with a Studio Background
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1.	
Open the image titled Ch08_Studio Background.jpg found in 
the Ch08 Practice Images folder.
2.	
Open the image titled Ch08_Portrait of Young Woman.jpg 
found in the Ch08 Practice Images folder as a layer (choose 
Layer ➤ Open Image as Layer).
3.	
Rename the layer Portrait using the layer thumbnail’s textbox.
4.	
Change the layer’s blending mode to Darken using the Toggle 
layer settings (Figure 8-13). The lightest areas will become 
transparent, leaving the darkest portions of the image intact.

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
182
5.	
Duplicate the layer (Layer ➤ Duplicate Layer) and change the 
blending mode to Normal.
6.	
Click the Lasso tool icon (or press L on your keyboard).
7.	
Make a selection of the background, getting close to the young 
woman (Figure 8-14).
Figure 8-13.  Change the Blending mode to Darken to make the background transparent 
and keep the dark portions intact

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
183
8.	
Clear the pixels (Edit ➤ Clear). Press Control+D to deactivate 
the selection.
9.	
Click the Eraser tool icon (or press E on your keyboard). Select 
the soft, 150-pixel diameter brush from the presets.
10.	
Starting on the left side, erase the fringe area of the background 
along the hair, as shown in Figure 8-15. This reveals the pixels 
of the underlying layer that remained intact when the blending 
mode was changed to Darken in Step 4.
Figure 8-14.  Use the Lasso tool to select most of the background

Chapter 8 ■ Removing/Adding Elements and Background Replacement 
184
11.	
Reduce the brush size to 30 pixels and set the hardness to 75% 
in the Tool Options dialog box, then work along the edge of the 
face and sweater (Figure 8-16).
■
■Note  As you work along the image with the Eraser tool, precision isn’t quite as 
important in the darker areas since the underlying pixels are intact. However, in the white 
areas of the sweater, be sure to use care along the edge.
Figure 8-15.  Use the Eraser tool to remove the fringe area of the background, revealing the 
intact pixels of the underlying layer

Figure 8-18 shows the before and after comparison. When you’re finished, either 
close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. If you are a 
student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name and in a 
certain location (such as a flash drive).

Summary
This chapter described several techniques for removing unwanted elements, adding 
elements, and replacing backgrounds.
In the first tutorial, unwanted items were removed by borrowing surrounding portions 
of the image and using the Clone Stamp tool to help blend it in for a seamless edit.
Next, we added an image of a cockatoo to go along with the macaw by using a layer 
mask. Using the Brush tool, it was “painted” in, and the fringe (excess) image data was 
removed using the Eraser tool.
In the last tutorial, we replaced the background of the image of a young woman. 
By using a layer with the Darken blend mode, the curly hair was kept intact, making the 
process fairly easy.
The next chapter covers using some of the adjustments and filters to create some fun 
projects.

CHAPTER 9
Artistic Effects Using 
Adjustments and Filters
Pixlr Editor is a useful tool for adding effects to images to achieve a variety of artistic 
results. In Chapter 3, we looked at each adjustment and filter to see what effect is 
produced. In this chapter, we’ll work with a few in the upcoming tutorials to see get a 
good idea of the editing potential they offer.
In this chapter, we’ll learn the following:
• 
Creating Shallow Depth-of-Field: In this part, we’ll use the 
Gaussian blur filter and the layer mask to emphasize the subject 
of an image.
• 
Creating a Partial Effect: In this tutorial, we’ll apply the Old Photo 
adjustment to part of the image while leaving the rest as is.
• 
Creating a Distressed Fence Mural: This part demonstrates how 
to use a combination of filters and layer blend modes to create a 
fence mural.
Creating Shallow Depth-of-Field
In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to put more emphasis on the macaw by digitally creating a 
shallow depth-of-field effect.

Summary
This chapter described several techniques for using adjustments and filters for creating 
artistic effects.
The Gaussian blur filter was used to create a shallow depth-of-field effect on the 
image of the Macaw, helping it to stand out from the background.
In the next tutorial, a partial effect was applied. The Old Photo adjustment is a good 
fit for the image, but by using a layer mask, the “patina” of the old car was maintained.
In the last tutorial, a “distressed” mural was created by applying the image of a 
tiger over a wooden fence and using a combination of the Pastels filter, the Posterize 
adjustment, the Overlay Blend mode. An assortment of brushes to erase certain areas of 
the image were used to give it a weathered appearance.
In the next chapter, we’ll use Pixlr Editor to create two graphic illustrations and a 
(fictitious) business card.

CHAPTER 10
Creating Graphic 
Illustrations
Until now, we’ve used Pixlr Editor to work with photographic images. As you’ve 
undoubtedly learned, it’s a very capable tool for image editing. It’s also a capable tool 
for creating raster-based illustrations. In this chapter, we’ll tap into the “inner artist” and 
create a few digital drawings using Pixlr Editor. Here’s what we’ll cover:
• 
Creating a Night Sky Illustration: In this part, we’ll create an 
illustration of a star filled night sky with a crescent moon.
• 
Creating a Billiard Illustration: This part provides step-by-step 
instructions for creating an illustration of a billiard ball used in 
the game of pool.
• 
Creating a Business Card: In this final tutorial, we’ll create a 
business card for a fictitious consignment shop.
■
■Note  Because you’ll be creating most of the images from scratch in this chapter, you 
don’t need to be concerned with duplicating the examples 100%. The goal of these tutorials 
is to acquaint the reader with techniques for creating images. Of course, it’s a good idea to 
strive to get as close as possible.
Creating a Night Sky Illustration
In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to draw a sky with stars (using the Brush tool) and a partial 
moon. Because creating the stars is a rapid process, your illustration will likely have a 
different star pattern than those shown in the upcoming figure(s).

Chapter 10 ■ Creating Graphic Illustrations

Your work should bear a reasonably close resemblance to the example shown in 
Figure 10-10—understandably, the star pattern in yours will likely differ. When you’re 
finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for future reference. 
If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with a certain name 
and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Creating a Billiard Illustration
In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to draw a billiard resting on a felt covered tabletop. There 
are quite a few steps involved in this tutorial, but it shouldn’t be too difficult to handle.
TUTORIAL 24: CREATING A BILLIARD
Drawing an Eight Ball Using Pixlr Editor
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1.	
Create a new image using the default presets. Name the image 
Billiard (or a name of your choosing).
2.	
Click in the Set Main Color swatch to open the Color Selector 
dialog box. Select a green hue using the numeric inputs: R-0, 
G-99, and B-33 (Figure 10-11). Click OK when you’re done.
Figure 10-10.  The final result should bear a reasonably close resemblance to this example

6.	
To smooth it out and make it appear more like felt, open the 
Gaussian Blur dialog box (Filter ➤ Gaussian Blur). Set the 
amount to 11 (Figure 10-13).
7.	
Create a new layer (Layer ➤ New Layer). Rename the new layer 
Ball using the layer thumbnail’s textbox.
8.	
Click the Marquee tool icon (or press M on your keyboard).
9.	
Select the Elliptical option and set the Constraint to Aspect ratio. 
Make sure the Anti-alias box is checked.
10.	
Click and drag on the layer named Ball to create a circular 
selection until the diameter is about 334 pixels—it will display 
as W: 334 and H: 334 in the Navigator Palette (Figure 10-14).

will be used to create the small, white circle to display the “8” 
character on).
16.	
Rename the duplicate layer Inner Circle using the layer 
thumbnail’s textbox.
17.	
Invert the color from black to white (Adjustment ➤ Invert).
18.	
Select the Free Transform tool (Edit ➤ Free Transform). Hold 
the Shift key and drag downward from the upper-left corner 
to maintain the aspect ratio and keep the circle centered. The 
white circle’s diameter should be about half that of the black 
circle’s (Figure 10-15).

Your work should look very much like the example shown in shown in Figure 10-20. 
When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file for 
future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image with 
a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Creating a Business Card
Pixlr Editor is first and foremost an image editing application, not a page layout 
application. However, it can be used to create simple marketing materials such as 
business cards or small postcards in a pinch.
In this final tutorial, we’ll design a business card for a fictitious consignment shop.
■
■Note   Pixlr Editor doesn’t have pre-installed fonts—instead it works with the ones 
already installed on your computer. For the purposes of the tutorial that follows, I’ll be using 
Times New Roman and Arial Narrow. If those fonts aren’t installed on your computer, just 
choose the closest one(s) available.
Figure 10-20.  The final result should look very much like this

Chapter 10 ■ Creating Graphic Illustrations

TUTORIAL 25: CREATING A BUSINESS CARD
Using Pixlr Editor to Design a Card for Fictitious Business
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1.	
Create a new image using these dimensions—Width: 1050 X 
Height: 600. These dimensions equal the size of a standard 
business card measuring 3.5" x 2" when printed at 300 DPI.
■
■Note  Printing service bureaus (both brick-and-mortar and online) usually require a 
slightly larger width and height to allow for trimming. When creating work you plan to have 
printed, check their requirements first.
2.	
Click the Gradient tool icon.
3.	
Click the Gradient icon in the Tool Options bar—after the 
Options window opens, select the light gray-to-white gradient 
(Figure 10-21).

4.	
Click and drag from top-left corner to the bottom-right corner 
on the Background layer (the same direction as shown in the 
swatch).
5.	
Next, the silhouette of the woman will be placed on the 
background as a separate layer. To do this, open the  
Ch10_Silhouette in Dress.png file (Layer ➤ Open Image  
as Layer).
6.	
Rename the layer Figure using the layer thumbnail’s textbox.
7.	
Using the Free Transform tool (Edit ➤ Free Transform), reduce 
the size of the silhouette and position it in the area, as shown in 
Figure 10-22.
8.	
Click in the Set Main Color swatch to open the Color Selector 
dialog box.
9.	
Select a reddish hue using the numeric inputs: R-135, G-23, 
and B-23 (Figure 10-23). Click OK when you’re done.

Open the Layer Styles dialog box (Layer ➤ Layer Styles) and 
click the Bevels option. This will give the main text a raised, 3D 
effect (Figure 10-25). Click OK when you’re done.
13.	
Open the Type tool again and type the company message below 
the name: “Gently loved women’s fashions for less” (Figure 10-26). 
Use the Times New Roman (or similar) font. Make the size 40 
and the style Italic. Click OK when you’re done.

16.	
Use the Move tool to position each text layer as shown in 
Figure 10-29. The final result should be reasonably close. Of 
course, if font substitution was required, it will probably look 
somewhat different.

When you’re finished, either close the image without saving or save it as a PXD file 
for future reference. If you are a student, your teacher may instruct you to save the image 
with a certain name and in a certain location (such as a flash drive).
Summary
Even though Pixlr Editor is designed primarily for editing photographic images, it can 
be used for creating pixel-based illustrations and for (to a limited degree) simple layouts 
such as business cards or postcards.
Conclusion
If you’ve completed all of the tutorials, congratulations! You did a great deal of work, and 
you’ve undoubtedly learned a great deal in the process. It’s my hope that this book helped 
you gain some valuable knowledge and skills that you can use from now on.
Just remember, being good at photo editing takes time and practice, so keep going...
and best wishes in your future endeavors.
