About the Author
Tony Bove has written more than two dozen books on computing, desktop 
publishing, and multimedia, including iLife ’04 All-In-One Desk Reference For 
Dummies (Wiley), The GarageBand Book (Wiley), The Art of Desktop 
Publishing (Bantam), and a series of books about Macromedia Director, 
Adobe Illustrator, and PageMaker. Tony also founded Desktop Publishing/
Publish magazine and the Inside Report on New Media newsletter, and he 
wrote the weekly Macintosh column for Computer Currents for a decade, as 
well as articles for NeXTWORLD, the Chicago Tribune Sunday Technology 
Section, and NewMedia. Tracing the personal computer revolution back to 
the 1960s counterculture, Tony produced a CD-ROM interactive documentary 
in 1996, Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties (featuring music from the Grateful 
Dead, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane). He also developed the Rockument 
music site, www.rockument.com, with commentary and podcasts focused 
on rock music history. As a founding member of the Flying Other Brothers 
(www.flyingotherbros.com), which toured professionally and released 
three commercial CDs (52-Week High, San Francisco Sounds, and Estimated 
Charges), Tony performed with Hall of Fame rock musicians. Tony has also 
worked as a director of enterprise marketing for leading-edge software com-
panies, and as a communications director and technical publications man-
ager. Tony offers iPod, iPhone, and iTunes tips and techniques on his Web 
site (www.tonybove.com).


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my siblings and cousins, and my sons and their 
cousins and children . . . the iPod generation.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank John Paul Bove and Jimi Eric Bove for providing technical 
expertise and performing valuable testing. I also want to thank Rich Tennant 
for his wonderful cartoons, and Geoff Coryell and Dennis Cohen for technical 
expertise. And let me not forget my Wiley editors Paul Levesque and Virginia 
Sanders for ongoing assistance that made my job so much easier. A book this 
timely places a considerable burden on a publisherís production team, and I 
thank the production crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call of reason.
I owe thanks and a happy hour or three to Carole McLendon at Waterside, my 
agent. And finally, I have Executive Editor Bob Woerner at Wiley to thank for 
coming up with the idea for this book and helping me to become a profes-
sional dummy — that is, a Dummies author.

Introduction
You don’t need much imagination to see why so many people are so 
happy with their iPods and iPhones, or why hundreds of millions of 
iPods and millions of iPhones have been sold as of this writing. Imagine no 
longer needing to take CDs or DVDs with you when you travel — your favor-
ite music and videos fit right in your pocket, and you can leave your precious 
content library at home. 
What’s more, this library is stored in electronic form (and easily backed up 
to other media), so it never deteriorates — unlike CDs, DVDs, and other 
physical media that may last only a few decades. 
When I first encountered the iPod, it came very close to fulfilling my dream 
as a road warrior — in particular, the dream of filling up a car with music 
as easily as filling it up with fuel. For example, I use a fully loaded iPod with 
my car using a custom in-vehicle interface adapter that offers an iPod con-
nector; or I use a cassette adapter, or even FM radio transmitter, in a rental 
car or boat (see Chapter 17). Whether you want to be On the Road with Jack 
Kerouac (in audio book form) or “Drivin’ South” with Jimi Hendrix, just fill up 
your iPod or iPhone and go!
But first, learn about the iTunes application, which is the center of my media 
universe and the software that manages content on my iPods, my iPhone, 
and my Apple TV. I bring all my content into iTunes — from CDs, the online 
iTunes Store, and other sources — and then parcel it out to various iPods, 
iPhones, and Apple TV for playback. Even though I occasionally use Apple TV 
rather than my computer running iTunes to enter the iTunes Store to rent or 
buy movies or buy other content, that content is automatically synchronized 
with my main iTunes library. All my content is stored in my main iTunes 
library on my computer, and backed up to another hard drive and to DVD 
discs. You can manage all these activities with iTunes.
iTunes was originally developed by Jeff Robbin and Bill Kincaid as an MP3 
player called SoundJam MP, and released by Casady & Greene in 1999. It was 
purchased by Apple in 2000 and redesigned and released as iTunes. Since 
then, Apple has released numerous updates to support new iPods and iPhones 
and fix bugs, and to add and tweak features such as the online store, gapless 
playback, support for Apple TV, the Cover Flow cover browser, improved 

2
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 6th Edition 
sorting and browsing options, the Genius button, and support for purchasing 
higher-quality audio tracks without the Digital Rights Management (DRM) copy 
protection. 
Do we need a Genius button, or gapless playback? The Genius button, which 
generates a playlist of songs from your library that go well with other songs 
you selected, is software at its best — suggesting new things to help you 
explore your library. And the gapless playback feature is truly innovative 
because it helps you bridge the gap between your physical and digital music 
collections without losing audio quality.
These are just two of many overlooked features of iTunes that can improve 
your music library and your iPod or iPhone experience. All the important 
new features are covered in this book. iTunes is getting better all the time, 
and this book gets you started.
About This Book
The publishers are wise about things like this, and they helped me design 
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 6th Edition, as a reference. You can easily find 
the information you need when you need it. I wrote it so that you can read 
from beginning to end to find out how to use iTunes and your iPod, iPhone, 
and Apple TV from scratch. But this book is also organized so that you can 
dive in anywhere and begin reading the info you need to know for each task.
I don’t have enough pages to cover every detail of every function of the soft-
ware, and I intentionally leave out some detail so that you’re not befuddled 
with technospeak when it’s not necessary. (Really, engineers can sometimes 
provide too many obscure choices that no one ever uses; on the other hand, I 
did need gapless playback.) I write brief but comprehensive descriptions and 
include lots of cool tips on how to get the best results from using iTunes and 
your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV.
At the time I wrote this book, I covered every iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV 
model available and the latest version of iTunes. Although I did my best to 
keep up for this print edition, Apple occasionally slips in a new model or 
new version of iTunes between book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPod, 
iPhone, or Apple TV that’s not covered in the book, or if your version of 
iTunes looks a little different, be sure to check out the companion Web site 
for updates on the latest releases from Apple.

 Introduction
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers and information technology, this book 
uses certain conventions:
 
 Choosing from a menu: When I write “Choose iTunes➪Preferences in 
iTunes,” you click iTunes on the toolbar and then choose Preferences 
from the iTunes menu.
 
 With the iPod, when you see “Choose Settings➪Brightness from the iPod 
main menu,” you highlight Settings in the main menu with the scroll 
wheel and press the Select button to choose Settings, and then highlight 
and choose Brightness from the Settings menu. With an iPod touch or 
iPhone, touch Settings on the Home menu and then touch Brightness.
 
 Clicking and dragging: When you see “Drag the song over the name of 
the playlist,” I mean you need to click the song name, hold the mouse 
button down, and then drag the song with the mouse over to the name 
of the playlist before lifting your finger off the mouse button.
 
 Keyboard shortcuts: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô key on a Mac key-
board along with the appropriate shortcut key. (In this case, press I, 
which opens the Song Information window in iTunes.) In Windows, the 
same keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-I (which means press the Ctrl key along 
with the I key).
 
 Step lists: When you come across steps that you need to do in iTunes or 
on the iPod or iPhone, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part fol-
lows. If you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. 
But if you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.
 
 Pop-up menus: I use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that 
literally pop up from dialogs and windows; in Windows, the same type 
of menu actually drops down and is called a drop-down menu. I use the 
term pop-up menu for both. 
And Just Who Are You?
You don’t need to know anything about music or audio technology to discover 
how to make the most of your iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and iTunes. Although a 
course in music appreciation can’t hurt, these devices and iTunes are designed 
to be useful even for air-guitar players who barely know the difference between 
downloadable music and System of a Down. You don’t need any specialized 
knowledge to have a lot of fun while building up your digital music library.

4
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 6th Edition 
However, I do make some honest assumptions about your computer skills:
 
 You know how to use Mac Finder or Windows Explorer. I assume that 
you already know how to locate files and folders and that you can copy 
files and folders from one hard drive to another on the computer of your 
choice: a Mac or a Windows PC.
 
 You know how to select menus and applications on a Mac or a 
Windows PC. I assume that you already know how to choose an option 
from a menu; how to find the Dock on a Mac to launch a Dock applica-
tion (or use the Start menu in Windows to launch an application); and 
how to launch an application directly by double-clicking its icon.
For more information on these topics, see these excellent books, all by 
Wiley: Mac OS X Leopard All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Mark L. 
Chambers), Windows Vista All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Woody 
Leonhard), or Windows XP GigaBook For Dummies (Peter Weverka).
A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, and each part covers a different aspect 
of using your iPod or iPhone and iTunes. Here’s a quick preview of what you 
can find in each part.
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring
Media Content
This part gets you started with your iPod or iPhone: powering it up, recharging 
its battery, using its menus, and connecting it to your computer. You install 
and set up iTunes on your Mac or your Windows PC. I then show you what 
you can do with iTunes. To acquire music, you can buy music from the iTunes 
Store or rip audio CDs. You can also find podcasts, audio books, movies, TV 
shows, and music videos in the iTunes Store or import them into iTunes from 
other sources. 
Part II: Managing Your Media
This part shows you how to sort the content in your iTunes library by artist, 
album, duration, date, and other items. You find out how to add and edit 
iTunes song information, and even fine-tune the sound of each song with a 
built-in equalizer. You also discover how to arrange songs and albums into 
iTunes playlists that you can transfer to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV and 
burn onto audio CDs.

 Introduction
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone
I show you how to locate and play all types of content — music, audio books, 
podcasts, movies, TV shows, and videos — on your iPod, and on the iPod 
section of your iPhone. I also describe how to use your iPod touch or iPhone 
to connect wirelessly to the Internet and surf the Web, play YouTube videos, 
check and send e-mail, and even check your stocks and the weather in your 
city. With an iPod touch or iPhone you can also add personal contacts and 
calendar information, display maps and driving directions, and run thou-
sands of applications. 
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone
This part covers how to use your iPod or iPhone on the road with car stereos 
and portable speakers. You find out all the techniques of an iPod road war-
rior: setting your alarm clock, keeping time with your stopwatch, changing 
your display settings, and synchronizing your iPod or iPhone with all your 
personal information. I also provide initial troubleshooting steps and details 
about updating and restoring your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, I outline common problems and solu-
tions for most iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV models, and I provide tips about 
the iTunes and iPod equalizer settings. I also list some Web resources for 
even more information on iPod and iPhone products and services.
Bonus Chapters
This book includes a number of bonus chapters on the companion Web site 
at www.dummies.com/go/ipod6e. Scattered through those chapters you’ll 
find even more great informational nuggets. Topics include:

In This Chapter

 Powering up your iPod or iPhone
 Using and recharging your battery
 Scrolling through the iPod and iPhone menus
T
he B-52’s sing, “Roam if you want to, roam around the world” through 
your headphones as you take off. The flight is just long enough to watch 
Tom Cruise in the movie Vanilla Sky and the “Mr. Monk and the Airplane” 
episode from the first season of the Monk TV show, as well as catch up on the 
latest episodes of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report. It’s 
so easy to hold and watch your iPod or iPhone that you don’t have to put it 
away when your flight dinner arrives. You even have time to listen to the NFL 
Rants and Raves podcast to catch up on American football.
As the plane lands, you momentarily forget where you’re going, so you read 
your destination information on your iPod or iPhone without even pausing the 
podcast and you queue up a playlist of songs to get you through the terminal. 
If Chicago is your kind of town, you might choose Frank Sinatra. If you’re in San 
Francisco, you might choose anything from Tony Bennett to the Grateful Dead. 
You have so much content on your iPod or iPhone (that you can select and 
play so easily) that you probably could land anywhere in the world with appro-
priate music in your ear and convenient eye candy in your hand.
iPods changed the way people play music on-the-run. Now, they’re changing 
the way people play TV shows and videos. An iPod or iPhone holds so much 
music that no matter how large your music collection is, you’ll seriously con-
sider putting all your music into digital format on your computer, transferring 
portions of it to an iPod (and an iPhone, if you’re like me), and playing music 
from both your computer at home and on your iPod or iPhone on the road. 
And there’s no need to wait for the best episodes of your favorite TV shows 
to be broadcast, because you can download the shows anytime you want and 
play them on an iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or iPhone anywhere you 
want. Albums, music videos, TV shows, and movies — you might never stop 
buying CDs and DVDs, but you won’t have to buy all your content that way. 
And you’ll never again need to replace the content that you already own.

10
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
As an iPod or iPhone owner, you’re on the cutting edge of entertainment 
technology. This chapter introduces iPods and iPhones and tells you what 
to expect when you open the box. I describe how to power up your iPod or 
iPhone and connect it to your computer, both of which are essential tasks 
that you need to know how to do — your iPod or iPhone needs power, and it 
needs audio and video, which it gets from your computer.
Introducing the iPod and iPhone
An iPod is, essentially, a hard drive or flash memory drive as well as a digital 
music and video player in one device. An iPod is such a thing of beauty and 
style — and so highly recognizable by now — that all Apple needs to do in an 
advertisement is show one all by itself. The iPhone is everything an iPod is, 
plus a cell phone!
The convenience of carrying music on an iPod or iPhone is phenomenal. For 
example, the 120GB iPod classic can hold around 30,000 songs. That’s more 
than six weeks of nonstop music played around the clock — or about two 
new songs per day for the next 41 years. And with built-in skip protection in 
every model, you won’t miss a beat as you jog through the park or when your 
car hits a pothole.
A common misconception is that your iPod or iPhone becomes your music and 
video library. Actually, your iPod or iPhone is simply another player for your 
content library, which is safely stored on your computer. One considerable 
benefit of using your computer to organize your content is that you can make 
perfect-quality copies of music, videos, movies, podcasts, and audio books. 
You can then copy as much of the content as you want, in a more compressed 
format, onto your iPod or iPhone and take it on the road. Meanwhile, your 
perfect copies are stored safely on your computer. Your favorite albums, audio 
books, TV shows, movies, and podcast episodes can be copied over and over 
forever, just like the rest of your information, and they never lose their quality. 
If you save your content in digital format, you’ll never see your songs or videos 
degrade, and you’ll never have to buy the content again.
The iPod and iPhone experience includes iTunes (for Mac or Windows), 
which lets you synchronize content with your iPod and other devices, such 
as the Apple TV player for your home TV and stereo. You also use iTunes to 
organize your content, make copies, burn CDs, and play disc jockey without 
discs. I introduce iTunes in Chapter 2.
An iPod is also a data player, and in the case of the iPod touch and iPhone, a 
complete personal digital assistant that lets you enter data as well as play it. With 
an iPod touch or iPhone you can check and send e-mail, visit your favorite Web 
sites, get maps, obtain driving directions, check the current weather, and even 
check your stock portfolio, to name a just a few things. You can transfer your 

11
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
calendar and address book to an iPod or iPhone, and you can keep your calen-
dar and address book automatically synchronized to your computer, no matter 
which device you use to add and edit information (as I describe in Chapter 19). 
Comparing iPod Models
Introduced way back in the Stone Age of digital music (2001), the iPod family 
has grown by six generations as of this writing, with custom versions for 
the band U2 and offshoots such as the popular iPod nano as well as the tiny 
iPod shuffle that lets you wear up to 500 songs on your sleeve. Even from the 
beginning, iPod models were truly innovative for their times. With the MP3 
music players of 2001, you could carry about 20 typical songs (or a single live 
Phish set) with you, but the first iPods could hold more than 1,000 typical 
songs (or a 50-hour Phish concert).
Earlier-generation iPods
Today’s iPod models and iPhone work with iTunes on either Windows com-
puters or Macs, but that wasn’t always the case. The first-generation iPods 
worked only with Macs. In 2002, Apple introduced the second generation — 
one version for Windows and another for the Mac, using the same design for 
both. For the third generation (2003), Apple changed the design once again.
Third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation iPods @md as well as offshoots, such 
as iPod mini, iPod nano, and iPod shuffle — work with either Windows or Mac 
and come in a variety of hard drive or flash memory sizes. By design, you can 
hold an iPod in your hand while you thumb the scroll wheel (my generic term for 
scroll wheel, scroll pad, touch wheel, or click wheel). The LCD screen on full-size 
models offers backlighting so that you can see it in the dark. The iPhone and 
iPod touch let you tap the sensitive display with your finger to select items and 
functions, and flick with your finger to scroll or move the display.
 
To find out more about previous generations of iPods, including detailed 
information about cables and connections, visit this book’s companion Web 
site. For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models, see the 
Identifying Different iPod Models page on the Apple iPod Web site (http://
support.apple.com/kb/HT1353).
Sixth-generation iPods
Apple shook the world once again in late 2007 by introducing a new genera-
tion of iPod models with attractive enclosures and easier-to-use controls and 
then revised these models in 2008. (See Figure 1-1.)

12
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
Figure 1-1: 
Sixth-
generation 
iPods 
include (left 
to right) the 
iPod touch, 
iPod classic, 
iPod nano, 
and iPod 
shuffle.
 
The sixth-generation iPod models include
 
 The iPod touch: The new, slimmer iPod touch shares the design char-
acteristics and many of the features of the iPhone and now has a built-in 
speaker and volume controls on the left side. It offers a touch-sensitive 
display and Wi-Fi Internet connectivity so that you can purchase music 
and applications wirelessly from your iPod and surf the Web. (Wi-Fi, 
which is short for wireless fidelity, is a popular connection method for 
local area networks; you can set up your home or office with Wi-Fi using 
an inexpensive Wi-Fi hub, such as Apple’s AirPort Extreme.) 
 
 The iPod classic: The original iPod design is slimmer and offers higher 
capacity (120GB) than other current models.
 
 The iPod nano: The new slimmer iPod nano now comes in a variety 
of colors and includes the same motion sensor as the iPhone and iPod 
touch; you can shake the iPod nano to shuffle your songs! 
 
 The iPod shuffle: The tiniest iPod comes in a variety of colors.
You can put audio books, podcasts, and videos on your iPhone, iPod touch, 
iPod classic, or iPod nano models using iTunes. You can even get some of 
your favorite TV shows, plus music videos and full-length movies, directly 
from the iTunes Store. 
Like third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation iPods, the sixth generation also uses 
a dock adapter cable to connect the iPod or iPhone to a computer or power 
supply. You can also use an Apple or third-party dock with your iPod or 
iPhone, and use the dock adapter cable to connect the dock to your com-
puter or power supply. The dock keeps your iPod or iPhone in an upright 
position while connected and lets you connect a home stereo or headphones. 
This makes the dock convenient as a base station when you’re not traveling 

13
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
with your iPod or iPhone, because you can slip it into the dock without con-
necting cables. You can pick one up at an Apple Store or order one online, or 
take advantage of third-party dock offerings.
Fingering the iPod touch
The iPod touch, like the iPhone, lets you access the Web over a Wi-Fi Internet 
connection. You can use the built-in Safari Web browser to interact with Web 
services and applications, and the YouTube application to play YouTube 
videos on the Web. The iPod touch offers an on-screen keyboard for typing 
login entries, passwords, and text of any kind, including numbers and punc-
tuation symbols. The innovative touch-sensitive display provides a rich set of 
navigation controls and menus controlled by software. You can use the cover 
browser with your finger to browse your music and video collection. You 
can even access Apple’s iTunes Store and App Store directly from your iPod 
touch and purchase content, as I describe in Chapter 4.
Less than a third of an inch thick and weighing only 4 ounces, the iPod touch 
is slightly smaller than an iPhone and offers the same single menu button 
on the front. Apple offers 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB models as of this writing. 
The 8GB model holds about 1,750 songs, 10,000 photos, or about 10 hours of 
video. The 16GB model holds about 3,500 songs, 20,000 photos, or about 20 
hours of video. The 32GB model holds about 7,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or 
about 40 hours of video. All three models use the same battery that offers up 
to 36 hours of music playback, or 6 hours of video playback.
Twirling the iPod classic
The sixth-generation iPod classic model uses the same click wheel and buttons 
as the fifth-generation models, combining the scroll wheel with pressure-sensi-
tive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad 
of the wheel. As of this writing, Apple provides a slim, 4.9-ounce 120GB model. 
The 120GB model holds about 30,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or about 150 
hours of video, and its battery offers up to 36 hours of music playback, or 6 
hours of video playback. 
Mano a mano with iPod nano
The new iPod nano, pencil thin and only one-and-a-half inches wide by three-
and-a-half inches high, weighs only 1.3 ounces but packs a punch: video. This 
mini marvel (see Figure 1-2) offers a 2-inch color LCD display that crisply 

14
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
displays video, iPod menus, and album artwork. Apple offers an 8GB model 
that holds about 2,000 songs or up to 8 hours of video (or 7,000 photos), and 
a 16GB model that holds about 4,000 songs or up to 16 hours of video (or 
14,000 photos).
Each model offers a battery that can play up to 24 hours of music — all day 
and all night — or 4 hours of video.
The iPod nano is the smallest iPod that can serve up videos, podcasts, 
photos, and musical slide shows as well as your personal calendar and con-
tacts. Unlike the smaller iPod shuffle, iPod nano is a full-featured iPod with 
loads of accessories tailored specifically for it.
iPod nano uses the same style of click wheel and buttons as the sixth-generation 
iPod classic models. Like other sixth-generation iPods, iPod nano uses a dock 
adapter cable to connect to a computer or power supply. A variety of docks for 
the iPod nano are available from Apple and other companies.

 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Doing the iPod shuffle
If the regular iPod models aren’t small enough to fit into your lifestyle, try 
iPod shuffle — either the 1GB or 2GB model. The 0.55-ounce iPod shuffle, as 
shown in Figure 1-3, is shaped like a money clip and is about the same size — 
1.07 x 1.62 inches with a depth of 0.41 inch. In several different flashy colors 
and convenient for clipping to just about anything, the iPod shuffle is fast 
becoming a fashion statement.
iPod shuffle models have no display, but that’s actually a good thing because 
this design keeps the size and weight down to a minimum, and you don’t 
need a display to play a couple hundred songs in random or sequential order. 
You can also use your iPod shuffle to hold data files, just like an external 
flash memory drive.
The 1GB iPod shuffle holds about 240 songs, and the 2GB shuffle holds about 
500 songs, assuming an average of 4 minutes per song, using the AAC format 
at the High Quality setting for adding music (as described in Chapter 5). 
Remember, iPod shuffle is not meant to store music permanently. Instead, 
you use it just to play selections from your iTunes library on your computer.
 
Figure 1-3: 
An iPod 
shuffle 
weighs 
less than 
an ounce 
and offers 
skip-free 
playback.
 

16
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
With skip-free playback, lightweight design, and no need for a display, you 
can easily use it while skiing, snowboarding, or even skydiving. That’s 
because it uses flash memory rather than a hard drive: You can shake it as 
hard as you want without a glitch. An iPod shuffle battery offers up to 12 
hours of power between charges.
 
Unlike other iPods, iPod shuffle can’t play tunes in the highest-quality Audio 
Interchange File Format (AIFF) or Apple Lossless formats, which consume a 
lot of storage space. See Chapter 5 for details on adding music to your iTunes 
library.
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, and about converting music 
from one format to another, visit this book’s companion Web site.
The current iPod shuffle models built to resemble a money clip connect to 
power and to your computer by using a special mini-dock supplied in the 
box. The mini-dock includes a cable that links your iPod shuffle to a com-
puter or to an optional power supply and supplies power for recharging its 
battery. You don’t need a separate cable. iPod shuffle charges its battery 
from your computer, so you don’t need the optional power supply. You can 
also get the optional $29 iPod shuffle External Battery Pack, which provides 
20 additional hours of playtime with two AAA batteries.
The Innovative iPhone
When Apple made the first iPhone available on June 29, 2007, lines formed 
around the block at the Apple stores as eager early adopters bought out all 
inventories. The iPhone was the first device to incorporate Apple’s innova-
tive touch-sensitive display, and formed the basis for the design of the iPod 
touch. The touch-sensitive display provides a rich set of navigation controls 
and menus controlled by software — including a full on-screen keyboard for 
entering text, numbers, and special symbols. (See Figure 1-4.) The iPhone, 
which includes all the features of an iPod touch, can not only phone home 
but also monitor all your e-mail and browse the Internet with full page dis-
play, using a Wi-Fi network when it senses one.
The iPhone 3G, introduced in July of 2008, is slimmer and more powerful than 
the original iPhone, adding fast 3G wireless technology, GPS mapping, and 
the capability for enterprises to push virtual private network (VPN) and Wi-Fi 
configurations out to all their iPhones in the field. It comes in 8GB ($199) or 
16GB ($299) models and incorporates flash memory just like an iPod touch, 
iPod shuffle or iPod nano. Its 3.5-inch, widescreen, multi-touch display offers 
480-x-320–pixel resolution at 160 dots per inch for crisp video pictures, and it 
can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.

The iPhone’s built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery offers up to 10 hours 
of talk time using 2G or 5 hours using 3G (with 300 hours on standby), up to 
6 hours browsing the Internet on Wi-Fi or 5 hours using 3G, and up to 7 hours 
playing video, and up to 24 hours playing music. It also offers Bluetooth for 
using wireless headphones and microphones. And the iPhone is no slouch 
when it comes to acting like an iPod: It can play music, audio books, videos 
(such as TV shows, music videos, and even feature-length movies), and even 
podcasts. You can also display photos and slide shows set to music.

Thinking Inside the Box
Don’t destroy the elegantly designed box while opening it; you might want 
to place it prominently in your collection of Technology That Ushered in the 
21st Century. Before going any further, check the box and make sure that 
all the correct parts came with your iPod or iPhone. Keep the box in case, 
heaven forbid, you need to return the iPod or iPhone to Apple — the box 
ensures that you can safely return it for a new battery or replacement.
The iPod touch, iPod classic, iPod nano, and iPhone are each supplied with 
a stereo headset (earphones), a cable to connect your iPod or iPhone or its 
dock to a computer for power supply, and a dock adapter fitted for that use 
with Apple’s Universal Dock. The iPod shuffle comes with earphones and a 
special smaller dock to connect to a power adapter or your computer.
The iPhone also comes with a power adapter for recharging the battery. You 
will want to get a power adapter for your iPod (not in the box but available 
from the Apple Store) if you want to use AC power, rather than your com-
puter, to supply power to recharge your iPod.
 
You can get accessories, including Apple’s Universal Dock and an AC power 
adapter, separately, from the Apple Store (physical or online). For example, 
the iPod AV Connection Kit offers the adapter, AV cables, Apple Remote, and 
the Universal Dock with adapters for all models.
The accessories don’t stop there. Docks of various sizes, shapes, and func-
tions are available from vendors, such as Belkin, Monster, and Griffin. Some 
docks are combined with home speaker systems. You might also want a 
carrying case and some other goodies, many of which are described in this 
book. They’re available at the online Apple Store (www.apple.com/store) 
or the physical Apple Store or other consumer electronics stores.
You also need a few things that don’t come with the iPod or iPhone:
 
 A PC or Mac to run iTunes: On a PC, iTunes version 8 requires Windows 
XP (with Service Pack 2), or either 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows 
Vista, running on a 1GHz Intel or AMD processor with a QuickTime-
compatible audio card, and a minimum of 512MB of RAM; 1GB is 
required to play HD-quality videos. You need a DirectX 9.0-compatible 
video card with 32MB of video RAM (64MB recommended) to watch 
video, and you need a 2GHz Intel Core Duo or faster processor to play 
HD-quality videos from the iTunes Store.
 
 With a Mac, iTunes version 8 runs on all versions of Mac OS X (Leopard) 
and on the older Mac OS X (Tiger) version 10.4.9. (Version 10.4.10 or 
newer is required for the iPhone.) You need a 500 MHz processor or 
better (Intel or PowerPC) and at least 512MB of RAM; 1GB of RAM is 

19
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
required to play HD-quality videos. You also need an Intel, Power PC G5 
or 1GHz Power PC or faster processor; you need 16MB of video RAM, 
to watch video, and a 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor to play 
HD-quality videos from the iTunes Store.
 
 USB connection: You need support for USB 2.0 (also called a high-powered 
USB) for iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod shuffle, and fifth-generation iPods. 
However, you can use FireWire (IEEE 1394) with older iPod models. All 
current-model Macs and many PCs provide USB 2.0, and many Macs pro-
vide FireWire.
 
 For details about using USB or FireWire cables, visit this book’s compan-
ion Web site.
 
 Internet connection: Apple recommends a broadband Internet con-
nection to buy content and stream previews from the iTunes Store, 
although it is possible with a dialup connection. At a minimum, you need 
some kind of Internet connection to download iTunes itself.
 
 CD-R or DVD-R drive: Without a disc burner, you can’t burn your own 
discs. On a PC, you need a CD-R or DVD-R drive. On a Mac, you need a 
Combo or Super Drive to burn your own discs.
 
 iTunes: Make sure you have the current version of iTunes — use the 
automatic update feature, which I describe in Chapter 2, to keep your 
iTunes software up to date. You can also download iTunes for Windows 
or the Mac from the Apple site (www.apple.com/itunes/download); 
it’s free. See Chapter 2 for instructions.
 
 Older iPod models, still available in stores and online, might include ver-
sions of iTunes on CD-ROM as old as version 4.5, which is fine because 
version 4.5 works. (It just doesn’t have all the features of the current ver-
sion.) You can download a newer version at any time to replace it.
 
 QuickTime: QuickTime (required for video) comes with iTunes. The 
iTunes installer for the PC installs the newest version of QuickTime for 
Windows (version 7.5.5 as of this writing), replacing any older version 
you might have. Macs have QuickTime preinstalled (version 7.5.5 as of 
this writing), and Mac OS X automatically updates QuickTime if you use 
the Software Update feature of System Preferences in the Apple menu.
Powering Up Your iPod and iPhone
All iPod and iPhone models come with essentially the same requirement: 
power. Fortunately, each iPod and iPhone model also comes with a battery 
and a way of charging it, either directly from your computer or by using a 
cable and an AC power adapter that works with voltages in North America 
and many parts of Europe and Asia. (See Chapter 17 for information about 
plugging into power in other countries.)

20
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Current models (iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, iPod shuffle, and 
iPhone) — as well as the older iPod mini and third-, fourth-, and fifth-
generation iPods — offer a dock connection. You can connect these models 
to a dock that offers USB 2.0 connections for power and synchronizing (or 
FireWire for third-generation models). Docks for full-size iPods can also con-
nect to your home stereo through a line-out connection.
 
To find out more about previous generations of iPods, including detailed infor-
mation about power cables and connections, visit this book’s companion 
Web site. 
The supplied USB-dock cable has a USB connector on one end and a flat dock 
connector on the other end to connect to a dock or directly to an iPod or 
iPhone. You can connect the USB end to either the Apple (or third-party USB) 
power supply or the computer’s USB 2.0 port. 
The connection on the iPod or iPhone is the same as the connection on the 
back of the dock. To connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer, plug the 
flat connector of the cable into the device or dock and then plug the USB con-
nector on the other end into the USB port on your computer. (Press the same 
buttons on both sides of the flat connector to disconnect it.)
Most PCs and all current Macs already have USB 2.0, which is all you need 
to provide power and synchronize an iPod or iPhone with your computer. 
A USB 2.0 connection to a Mac provides power to an iPod or iPhone and 
recharges the battery as long as the Mac isn’t in sleep mode. 
Although you can use a low-powered USB 1.0 or 1.1 connection, it doesn’t 
supply power to most iPod or iPhone models. iPod classic and older models 
can use FireWire connections to charge their batteries but not for synchro-
nizing with a computer. 
The iPod shuffle is supplied with a mini-dock with a USB cable attached and 
draws power from the USB port on the computer or from a USB power adapter.
 
An older USB 1.0 or 1.1 port works for synchronizing an iPod nano or iPod 
classic or some older iPod models but it doesn’t provide power. If all you have 
is an older USB port, you can use it to synchronize an iPod and then use a 
FireWire cable (available from the Apple Store) to provide power by connect-
ing it to a FireWire–compatible AC power adapter.
 
Don’t use another USB device in a chain and don’t use a USB 2.0 hub to con-
nect your iPod or iPhone unless the hub is a powered hub. Note that a USB 
keyboard typically acts like a USB 1.1 hub, but it’s not powered, so it can’t pro-
vide power to the iPod or iPhone and might slow down performance.

21
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
 
If your iPod shows a display but doesn’t respond to your touch, don’t panic. Just 
check the Hold switch on top or bottom of the unit and make sure that it’s set to 
one side so that the orange bar disappears (the normal position). You use the 
Hold switch for locking the buttons, which prevents accidental activation.
You might notice that an iPod classic or iPod nano display turns iridescent 
when it gets too hot or too cold, but this effect disappears when its tem-
perature returns to normal. iPods can function in temperatures as cold as 
50 degrees and as warm as 95° F (Fahrenheit), but they work best at room 
temperature (closer to 68° F).
If you leave your iPod or iPhone out in the cold all night, it might have trou-
ble waking from sleep mode, and it might even display a low-battery message. 
Plug the iPod or iPhone into a power source, wait until it warms up, and try it 
again. If it still doesn’t wake up or respond properly, try resetting the iPod or 
iPhone as I describe in Chapter 20.
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from New York City to California and listen to your 
iPod the entire time — and with some models, listen all the way back on the 
return flight — without recharging. All iPod models use the same type of built-in, 
rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery with the following power specs:
 
 The first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models offer up to 8 hours 
of battery power.
 
 The fourth-generation models and the iPod shuffle offer up to 12 hours.
 
 The iPod mini offers up to 18 hours.
 
 The color-display fourth-generation models offer 15 hours of music play-
ing time or 5 hours of photo display with music.
 
 The fifth-generation iPod models offer between 14 and 20 hours of music 
playing time, between 3 and 6 hours of video playing time, or between 4 
and 6 hours of photo display with music.
 
 The iPod nano offers 24 hours of music playing time or 4 hours of video 
or photo display with music. 
 
 The sixth-generation iPod classic 120GB model offers 36 hours of music 
playback or 6 hours of video or photo display with music. 
 
 The iPod touch offers 36 hours of music playing time or 6 hours of video, 
browsing the Internet, or displaying photo slideshows with music.

22
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
 The iPhone models offer up to 24 hours of music playing time, 7 hours 
of video playing time, or between 4 and 6 hours of photo display with 
music. They offer up to 10 hours of talk time using 2G or 5 hours using 
3G (with 300 hours on standby) and up to 6 hours browsing the Internet 
on Wi-Fi or 5 hours using 3G.
However, keep in mind that playback battery time varies with the type of 
encoder you use when you add music to your iTunes library, as I describe in 
Chapter 5. It also varies depending on how you use your iPod or iPhone con-
trols and settings.
The iPod or iPhone battery recharges automatically when you connect it to a 
power source. For example, it starts charging immediately when you insert it 
into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer with a pow-
ered USB connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the battery fully 
for all models, and only three hours for an iPod nano.
 
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport ter-
minal or hotel lobby and plug in your iPod with your AC power adapter — the 
battery fast-charges to 80 percent capacity in 1.5 hours. After the first hour 
and a half, the battery receives a trickle charge for the next hour and a half, 
until fully charged.
 
Don’t fry your iPod or iPhone with some generic power adapter. Use only 
the power adapter from Apple or a certified iPod adapter, such as the power 
accessories from Belkin, Griffin, Monster, XtremeMac, and other vendors.
A battery icon with a progress bar in the top-right corner of the iPod or 
iPhone display indicates how much power is left. When you charge the bat-
tery, the battery icon displays a lightning bolt. If the icon doesn’t animate, 
the battery is fully charged. You can also use your iPod or iPhone while the 
battery is charging, or you can disconnect it and use it before the battery is 
fully charged.
To check the battery status of an iPod shuffle, slide the Off switch to the on 
position. If the battery status light is
 
 Green: The iPod shuffle is fully charged.
 
 Yellow: The charge is low.
 
 Red: Very little charge is left, and you need to recharge it.
If no light is visible, the iPod shuffle is completely out of power, and you need 
to recharge it to use it.

 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Maintaining battery life
 
The iPod or iPhone built-in, rechargeable battery is, essentially, a life-or-death 
proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but Apple charges a replace-
ment fee plus shipping. If your warranty is still active, you should have Apple 
replace it under the warranty program (which may cost nothing except per-
haps shipping). Don’t try to replace it yourself because opening your iPod or 
iPhone invalidates the warranty. If your warranty is no longer active, compare 
Apple’s prices and service to others. Some services may charge less than 
Apple, especially for older iPod models. For what it’s worth, I’ve had very 
good (if more expensive) experiences with Apple’s services.
Fortunately, the battery is easy to maintain. I recommend calibrating the bat-
tery once soon after you get your iPod or iPhone; that is, run it all the way 
down (a full discharge) and then charge it all the way up (which takes four 
hours). Although this doesn’t actually change battery performance, it does 
improve the battery gauge so that the gauge displays a more accurate reading.
Unlike nickel-based batteries that require you to fully discharge and then 
recharge in order to get a fuller capacity, an iPod or iPhone battery prefers a 
partial rather than a full discharge, so avoid frequent full discharges after the 
initial calibration. (Frequent full discharges can lower battery life.)
Lithium-ion batteries typically last three years or more and are vulnerable to 
high temperatures, which decrease their life spans considerably. Don’t leave 
your iPod or iPhone in a hot place, such as on a sunny car dashboard, for 
very long.
 
For a complete description of how Apple’s batteries work, see the Apple 
Lithium-ion Batteries page at www.apple.com/batteries.
The bottom of an iPod warms up when it’s powered on. The bottom functions 
as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the unit to the cooler air 
outside. A carrying case acts as an insulator, so be sure to remove the iPod 
or iPhone from a carrying case before you recharge it.
 
Keeping an iPod or iPhone in a snug carrying case when charging is tempting 
but also potentially disastrous. An iPod or iPhone needs to dissipate its heat, 
and you could damage the unit by overheating it and frying its circuits, ren-
dering it as useful as a paperweight. To get around this problem, you can pur-
chase one of the heat-dissipating carrying cases available in the Apple Store. 
Alternatively, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers a variety of sporty cases 
for about $30 to $40. See Chapter 17 for more on accessories.
 
Even when not in use, your iPod or iPhone drinks the juice. If your iPod or 
iPhone is inactive for 14 days, you must recharge its battery. Perhaps it gets 
depressed from being left alone too long; not even an iPhone can phone 
home by itself.

24
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
If your iPod or iPhone isn’t responding after a reset, follow the troubleshoot-
ing steps in Chapter 20. If these steps don’t restore your iPod or iPhone to 
working condition, you might have a battery problem. Go to the Apple sup-
port page for the iPod (www.apple.com/support/ipod) or the iPhone 
(www.apple.com/support/iphone) and click the Service FAQ link to 
read frequently asked questions and answers about support. Then click the 
Battery Service Request Form link on the support page and follow the instruc-
tions to request service and return your iPod or iPhone for a replacement.
Saving power
The iPod classic and older models include a hard drive, and whatever causes 
the hard drive to spin causes a drain on power. iPod nano, iPod shuffle, iPod 
touch, and iPhone models use a flash drive, which uses less power but still 
uses power when playing content. The iPod touch and iPhone also use power 
accessing the Internet, running applications, and in the case of the iPhone, 
making and receiving calls and using Bluetooth devices. Keeping these activi-
ties to a minimum can help you save power. One particularly power-hungry 
activity is restarting your iPod touch or iPhone from a power-off condition — 
it is better to use sleep mode to turn it on and off.
 
If you use the AIFF or WAV formats for adding music to your iTunes library, don’t 
use them with your iPod or iPhone. AIFF and WAV take up way too much space 
on the iPod or iPhone and fill up the cache too quickly, causing skips when you 
play them and using too much battery power because the hard drive or flash 
drive is accessed more often. (See Chapter 5 for details on adding music.) 
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats and about converting music 
from one format to another, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
 
The following are tips on saving power while using your iPod or iPhone:
 
 Pause. Pause playback when you’re not listening. Pausing (stopping) 
playback is the easiest way to conserve power.
 
 Lock it. Press the Sleep/Wake button on top of the iPod touch or iPhone 
to immediately put it to sleep and lock its controls to save battery 
power. You can set your iPod touch or iPhone to automatically go to 
sleep by choosing Settings➪General➪Auto-Lock from the Home menu, 
and choosing 1 Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 Minutes, 4 Minutes, or 5 Minutes (or 
Never, to prevent automatic sleep).
 
 Back away from the light. Turn down the brightness on an iPod touch 
or iPhone by choosing Settings➪Brightness and dragging the bright-
ness slider to the left. Use the backlight sparingly in iPod classic and 
iPod nano models. Select Backlight Timer from the iPod Settings menu 
to limit backlighting to a number of seconds, or to Off, in the iPod’s 
Settings menu. (Choose Settings from the main menu.) Don’t use the 
backlight in daylight if you don’t need it.

25
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
 
 Stop communicating (with the iPhone or iPod touch). Turn off 
Wi-Fi (choose Settings➪Wi-Fi and touch the On button to turn it off) 
when not browsing the Internet. Check e-mail less frequently. (See 
Chapter 16 for details.) On an iPhone, turn off Bluetooth (choose 
Settings➪General➪Bluetooth and touch the On button to turn it off) 
if you’re not using a Bluetooth device.
 
 Hold it (with the iPod classic or iPod nano). Flip the Hold switch on 
iPod classic and iPod nano models to the locked position (with the 
orange bar showing) to make sure that controls aren’t accidentally acti-
vated. You don’t want your iPod playing music in your pocket and drain-
ing the battery when you’re not listening.
 
 You may continue. Play songs continuously without using the iPod or 
iPhone controls. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/
Fast-Forward require more energy. Not only that, but the hard drive has 
to spin more often when searching for songs, using more power than 
during continuous playback.
Always use the latest iPod and iPhone software and update your software 
when updates come out. Apple constantly tries to improve how your iPod and 
iPhone models work, and many of these advancements relate to power usage.
Thumbing Through the iPod 
and iPhone Menus
After you bring content into iTunes and synchronize your iPod or iPhone, 
you’re ready to play. The design of the iPod classic and iPod nano lets you 
hold the iPod in one hand and perform simple operations by thumb. Even if 
you’re all thumbs when pressing small buttons on tiny devices, you can still 
thumb your way to iPod heaven. 
The iPod touch, like the iPhone, offers a multi-touch interface that lets you 
tap your way into iPod heaven even faster. With an iPod touch, your fingers 
do the walking. You can make gestures, such as flicking a finger to scroll a 
list quickly, sliding your finger to scroll slowly or drag a slider (such as the 
volume slider), pinching with two fingers to zoom out of a Web page in Safari, 
or pulling apart with two fingers (also known as un-pinching) to zoom in to 
the page to see it more clearly.
Touching iPod touch and iPhone displays
The first message you see on an iPod touch or iPhone display (besides the 
time of day and the date) is “Slide to unlock” — slide your finger across this 
message to unlock your iPod touch or iPhone.

26
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Your content is now immediately available at the touch of a finger. On an 
iPhone (refer to Figure 1-4),
 
 Use the iPod button in the lower-right corner of the Home menu to play 
your music and videos.
 
 Use the Photos button in the top row to view your photos.
 
 Use the iTunes button in the fourth row on the left side to access the 
iTunes store.
On an iPod touch (refer to Figure 1-5),
 
 Use the Music button on the far-left side of the bottom row of the Home 
menu to play your music.
 
 Use the Videos button next to the Music button in the bottom row to 
play your videos.
 
 Use the Photos button on the right side of the bottom row to view your 
photos.
 
 Use the iTunes button on the far-right side of the bottom row to access 
the iTunes store.
After touching a button on the iPod touch or iPhone display, a new page 
appears with more selections you can touch. In fact, you can touch every 
menu or button you see on the display. The iPod touch and iPhone run appli-
cations (Safari, Contacts, Calendar, YouTube, and so on), and the multi-touch 
interface changes for each application.
For example, touch the Music button on an iPod touch to view a list of artists. 
After touching Music, buttons appear along the bottom of the display that you 
can touch to view a list of playlists, artists, songs, albums, and more. With 
a flick of your finger, you can scroll the list and touch selections to view the 
albums of an artist or the contents of an album or playlist. Touch any song 
to start playing it, and control buttons appear to control playback: Previous/
Rewind, Play/Pause, Next/Fast-Forward, and a volume slider. The physical 
button on the front of the iPod touch or iPhone returns you to the Home menu.
The iPod touch and iPhone applications respond to gestures you make with 
your fingers. For example, you make the following gestures to perform the 
following functions:
 
 Drag with finger: Scroll up or down lists slowly.
 
 Flick: Quickly scroll up or down lists.
 
 Touch and hold: While scrolling, touch and hold to stop the moving list.

27

 Flick from left to right or right to left (swipe): Change screens or appli-
cation panes on the iPhone or iPod touch (Home menu, Weather, iPod 
Cover Flow view).
 
 Single tap: Select an item.
 
 Double tap: Zoom in or out with Safari, Maps, and other applications.
 
 Two-finger single tap: Zoom out.
 
 Pinch: Zoom out.
 
 Un-pinch: Zoom in.

Tapping keys on the iPod touch or 
iPhone on-screen keyboard
One sure feature to amaze your friends is the ability to whip out your iPod 
touch or iPhone and type notes, contact information, calendar entries, map 
locations, stock symbols, and even the addresses for Web sites, and make 
selections for pop-up menus. You can do all this with your iPod touch or 
iPhone on-screen keyboard, shown in Figure 1-6.

29
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
 
Figure 1-6: 
The on-
screen 
keyboard 
for entering 
information.
 
You may want to start with just one finger, and as you get used to it, try also 
using your thumb. Touch a text entry field, such as the URL field for a Web 
page in Safari (as I describe in Chapter 15), or a new contact or calendar 
entry or e-mail message (as I describe in Chapter 16), and the on-screen 
keyboard appears. Tap the keys, and as you type, each letter appears above 
your thumb or finger. If you touch the wrong key, slide your finger to the cor-
rect key. The letter is not entered until you release your finger from the key. 
To type an uppercase letter, touch the Shift key first. To quickly type a period 
and a space, double-tap the spacebar. To enter numbers, symbols, or punctua-
tion, touch the Number key, and touch the Symbol key for additional symbols.
To enable caps lock, choose Settings➪General ➪Keyboards, and touch the 
Off button next to Enable Caps Lock to turn it on (touch it again to turn it off). 
You can then double-tap the Shift key to turn on lock caps (uppercase let-
ters). The Shift key turns blue, and all letters you type are uppercase. Tap the 
Shift key again to turn caps lock off.
To edit text in an entry field, touch and hold to see a magnified view; then 
drag to position the insertion point. You can then tap keys to insert text, or 
use the backspace key to remove text.
The intelligent keyboard automatically suggests corrections as you type 
(some languages only). You don’t need to accept the suggested word — just 
continue typing if you don’t, but if you do want to accept it, tap the space-
bar, a punctuation mark, or the Return key. To reject the suggested word, 

30
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
finish typing the word as you want it; then tap the x to dismiss the suggestion 
before typing anything else. Each time you reject a suggestion for the same 
word, your iPod touch or iPhone keeps track and eventually adds your word 
to its dictionary. The iPod touch and iPhone include dictionaries for English, 
English (UK), French, French (Canada), German, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, 
and Dutch. The appropriate dictionary is activated automatically when you 
select an international keyboard.
The keyboard supports multiple languages, and you can even change the 
standard U.S. key arrangement of QWERTY to QWERTZ, AZERTY, QZERTY, 
or Japanese IME — choose Settings➪General ➪Keyboards ➪International 
Keyboards, and turn on the keyboards you need. You can then switch keyboards 
while typing information by tapping the globe icon that appears to the right of 
the “.?123” button when more than one international keyboard is turned on.
Scrolling iPod classic and nano wheels
The circular scroll wheel on iPod classic and iPod nano models makes scroll-
ing through an entire music collection quick and easy. With your finger or 
thumb, scroll clockwise on the wheel to scroll down a list or counterclock-
wise to scroll up. As you scroll, options on the menu are highlighted. Use 
the Select button at the center of the scroll wheel to select whatever is high-
lighted in the menu display.
In full-size, third-generation models, the touch-sensitive buttons above the 
scroll wheel perform simple functions when you touch them. (First- and sec-
ond-generation models aren’t touch sensitive, so you need to press them.)
Fifth-generation iPods and sixth-generation iPod classic models, iPod nano, 
iPod mini, and fourth-generation iPods (including color-display models) pro-
vide a click wheel that offers the same functions as the scroll wheel and the 
clickable buttons. The click wheel has pressure-sensitive buttons underneath 
the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad of the wheel. These 
areas tilt as you press them, activating the buttons.
The iPod main menu for sixth-generation iPod classic and iPod nano models 
offers the following selections:
 
 Music: Select music playlists, artists, albums, songs, genres, or compos-
ers; or select an audio book. You can also select Cover Flow to browse 
by cover art, or Search to search for a song or album title or artist (as I 
describe in Chapter 14).
 
 Videos: Select videos by video playlist or by type (movies, music videos, 
or TV shows).
 
 Photos: Select photos by photo album or select all photos in the photo 
library.

 Music: Select music playlists, artists, albums, songs, podcasts, genres, 
or composers; or select an audio book.
 
 Photos: Select photos by photo album or select individual photos in the 
photo library. This selection appears only on color-display models.
 
 Videos: Select videos by playlist or by type (movies, music videos, TV

takes you to the Now Playing display.
The iPod main menu for fourth-generation models and iPod nano is the same 
as fifth-generation models but without the Videos selection.
Activating iPod Playback Functions
The touch buttons on iPod touch and iPhone models do various tasks for 
playing content items such as songs, audio books, podcasts, and videos:
 
 Previous/Rewind: Tap once to start an item over. Tap twice to skip to 
the previous item (such as the previous song in an album). Touch and 
hold to rewind.
 
 Play/Pause: Tap to play the selected item. Tap Play/Pause when an item 
is playing to pause the playback.

 Next/Fast-Forward: Press once to skip to the next item. Press and 
hold Next/Fast-Forward to fast-forward.
The buttons and scroll wheel on full-size iPods can do more complex func-
tions when used in combination:
 
 Turn on the iPod. Press any button.
 
 Turn off the iPod. Press and hold the Play/Pause button.
 
 Disable the iPod buttons. To keep from accidentally pressing the but-
tons, push the Hold switch to the other side so that an orange bar 
appears (the locked position). To reactivate the iPod buttons, push the 
Hold switch back to the other side so that the orange bar disappears 
(the normal position).
 
 Reset the iPod. You can reset the iPod if it gets hung up for some 
reason. (For example, it might get confused if you press the buttons too 
quickly.) See Chapter 20 for instructions on how to reset your iPod.
 
 Change the volume. While playing a song (the display reads Now 
Playing), adjust the volume with the scroll wheel. Clockwise turns the 
volume up; counterclockwise turns the volume down. A volume slider 
appears on the iPod display, indicating the volume level as you scroll.
 
 Skip to any point in a song, video, audio book or podcast. While play-
ing an item (the display reads Now Playing), press and hold the Select 
button until the progress bar appears to indicate where you are, and 
then use the scroll wheel to scroll to any point in the song. Scroll clock-
wise to move forward and counterclockwise to move backward.

Setting the Language
Wiedergabelisten? Übersicht? (Playlists? Browse?) If your iPod classic or iPod 
nano is speaking in a foreign tongue, don’t panic — you’re not in the wrong 
country. You might have purchased one that’s set to a foreign language. More 
likely, someone set it to a different language accidentally or on purpose (as 
a practical joke). Fortunately, you can change the setting without having to 
know the language that it’s set to.
To set the language, no matter what language the menu is using, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the 
words on the display or until you see the word iPod at the top.
 
 If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at 
the main menu. With fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation models and 
iPod nano, the menu displays the word iPod no matter what language is 
selected — and you know you’re at the main menu.
 
2. Choose the sixth option from the top on sixth-generation iPods and 
the iPod nano, or the fifth option on fifth-generation iPods, or the 
fourth option on fourth-generation iPods, iPod mini, and the older 
iPod nano. Choose the third option from the top on third-, second-, 
and first-generation models. (In English, this is the Settings option.)
 
 Scroll clockwise until the item is highlighted, and then press the Select 
button. The Settings menu appears.
 
3. Choose the third option from the bottom of the Settings menu (which, 
in English, is the Language option).
 
 The Language menu appears.
 
4. Choose the language that you want to use. (English is at the top of 
the list.)
If these steps don’t do the trick, the menu may have been customized. 
Someone could have customized it previously, or perhaps you accidentally 
pressed buttons that customized the menu. 
 
To learn about advanced iPod and iPhone techniques such as customizing 
your menus, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
To get around this problem, you can reset all the iPod settings back to the 
defaults (which is not the same as simply resetting your iPod, as described in 
Chapter 20). Unfortunately, resetting your iPod’s settings wipes out any cus-
tomizations that you’ve made. You have to redo any repeat/shuffle settings, 
alarms, backlight timer settings, and so on.

34
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Follow these steps to reset all your settings, no matter what language displays:
 
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the 
words on the display or until you see the word iPod at the top.
 
 If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at 
the main menu. With fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation models and 
iPod nano, the menu displays the word iPod no matter what language is 
selected — and you know you’re at the main menu.
 
2. Choose the sixth option from the top on sixth-generation iPods and 
the iPod nano, or the fifth option on fifth-generation iPods, or the 
fourth option on fourth-generation iPods, iPod mini, and the older 
iPod nano. Choose the third option from the top on third-, second-, 
and first-generation models. (In English, this is the Settings option.)
 
3. Choose the option at the bottom of the menu (in English, the Reset All 
Settings option).
 
 The Reset All Settings menu appears.
 
4. Choose the second menu option (in English, the Reset option; the first 
menu option is Cancel).
 
 The Language menu appears after choosing to reset all settings (because 
language is one of the settings). The first choice you have to make after 
resetting all settings is to choose a language, so you’re back in business.
 
5. Choose the language you want to use. (English is at the top of the list.)
The language you choose now applies to all the iPod menus. But don’t pull 
that practical joke on someone else!

and iPhone

 Setting up your iPod and iPhone
 Downloading upgrades to the software
A
n iPod or iPhone without iTunes is like a CD player without CDs. Sure, 
you can use utility programs from sources other than Apple to put 
music, podcasts, and videos on an iPod. But iTunes gives you access to the 
vast online iTunes Store and App Store, and it’s excellent for managing con-
tent on your computer and synchronizing your content library and personal 
information with your iPod or iPhone.
This chapter explains how to set up your iPod or iPhone with iTunes on a 
Mac or for Windows. iTunes includes the iPod and iPhone software, which 
provides the intelligence inside the device. iTunes is no slouch in the intel-
ligence department either, since it immediately recognizes the type of iPod or 
iPhone you have and installs the correct software.
Installing iTunes on a Windows PC
Setting up iTunes is a quick and easy process. The most up-to-date version of 
iTunes as of this writing is version 8. However, software updates occur very 
rapidly. If you really want the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site 
(www.apple.com/itunes) to get it. You can download iTunes for free.
 
The CD-ROMs supplied with older iPods offer older versions of iTunes and 
iPod software. You should visit the Apple Web site to download the most up-
to-date version of iTunes, which recognizes all iPod and iPhone models.

36
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Before installing iTunes, make sure that you’re logged on as a Windows 
administrator user. Quit all other applications before installing and be sure to 
disable any antivirus software.
 
The iTunes installer also installs the newest version of QuickTime, replacing 
any older version you might have. QuickTime is the Apple multimedia devel-
opment, storage, and playback technology. Although Windows users aren’t 
required to use QuickTime beyond its use by iTunes, QuickTime is a bonus for 
Windows users because it offers digital video playback.
To install iTunes for Windows, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
 
 Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes) and click the 
Download iTunes Free button, as shown in Figure 2-1. Follow the instruc-
tions to download the installer to your hard drive. (A crucial step here is 
picking a location on your hard drive to save the installer and remember-
ing that location.)
 
2. Run the iTunes installer.
 
 Double-click the iTunesSetup.exe file to install iTunes. At the 
Welcome screen, click Next. Apple’s License Agreement appears in 
the installer window. Feel free to scroll down to read the agreement if 
that’s something you tend to do. You must click the option to accept the 
agreement, or the installer goes no further.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Download 
the newest 
version of 
iTunes from

 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
 
3. Click the option to accept the terms of the License Agreement and 
then click Next.
 
 After clicking Next (which is active only if you accept), the installer dis-
plays the iTunes installation options, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Choose 
iTunes 
installation 
options.
 
 
4. Choose iTunes installation options.
 
 You can turn the following options on or off (as shown in Figure 2-2):
 
• Add iTunes and QuickTime shortcuts to my desktop: You can install 
shortcuts for your Windows desktop for iTunes and the QuickTime 
player.
 
• Use iTunes as the default player for audio files: I suggest turning this 
option on, allowing iTunes to be the default audio content player 
for all audio files it recognizes. If you’re happy with your audio 
player, you can deselect this option, leaving your default player 
setting unaffected.
 
• Automatically update iTunes and other Apple software: I suggest 
turning this option on, enabling iTunes to check for its own 
updates automatically over the Internet. You then have a choice to 
install the update.
 
5. Choose the destination language for iTunes.
 
 By default, the installer assumes that you want English (U.S.). If you 
want to use a different language, select one from the drop-down menu.
 
6. Choose the destination folder for iTunes.
 
 By default, the installer assumes that you want to store the program in the 
Program Files folder of your C: drive. If you want to use a different folder, 
click Change to use Windows Explorer to locate the desired folder.

38
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
7. Click Install to finish.
 
 After you click Install, the installer finishes the installation and displays 
the Complete dialog.
 
8. Click Finish.
 
 Restarting your Windows PC after installing software is always a good idea.
iTunes and QuickTime are now installed on your PC. To start using iTunes, 
double-click the iTunes desktop shortcut, or use your Start menu to locate 
iTunes and launch it.
The first time you launch iTunes, yet another Apple License Agreement 
appears. You must click Agree to continue (or cancel). After clicking Agree, 
iTunes displays the iTunes Setup Assistant — to get started, click Next.
The Setup Assistant displays two options: Add MP3 and AAC Files, and Add 
WMA Files. Select either or both options to copy music files into the iTunes 
library (without changing their current locations); WMA file copies are con-
verted to AAC (see Chapter 5 for descriptions of these formats). After select-
ing (or not selecting) these options, click Next to continue.
The Setup Assistant then asks if you want to keep your music folder orga-
nized. Choose Yes to keep the iTunes Music Folder organized, and click Next 
to continue. (For more information on how the iTunes Music Folder works,, 
see Chapter 12.) The Setup Assistant then displays a screen explaining how 
album artwork is downloaded (you need an iTunes Store account — see 
Chapter 4) — click Next to continue. Finally the Setup Assistant asks if you 
want to go directly to the iTunes Store. Choose Yes to go directly to the 
store, or No to go directly to your iTunes library, and click Finish.
Installing iTunes on a Mac
As a Mac user, you should already have iTunes installed because all Macs 
sold since 2003 come preinstalled with iTunes and Mac OS X. The most up-to-
date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 8.
The version of iTunes that’s provided with the Mac might be the newest ver-
sion; then again, it might not be. If iTunes displays a dialog with the message 
that a new version of iTunes is available and asks whether you would like 
to download it now, click Yes to download the new version. Mac OS X not 
only downloads iTunes but installs it automatically.
 
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of iTunes 
when it becomes available. Choose Preferences from the iTunes menu, click 
the General tab, and click the Check for Updates Automatically check box at 
the bottom of the General preferences to turn it on.

39
 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
 
You can also set your Mac to check for all system software and Apple applica-
tions (including iTunes). Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, 
and then choose Software Update from the System Preferences window. Click 
the Check for Updates check box to turn it on, and select Daily, Weekly, or 
Monthly from the pop-up menu. You can also click the Check Now button to 
check for a new version immediately. If one exists, it appears in a window for 
you to select. Click the check mark to select it and then click Install to down-
load and install it.
If you want to manually install iTunes on your Mac or manually upgrade the 
version you have, browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes) to 
get it. You can download iTunes for free. Follow these steps:
 
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
 
 Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes), select the Mac 
OS X version you have installed on your computer, and then click the 
Download iTunes button. (Refer to Figure 2-1.) Your browser downloads 
the iTunes installer disk image file iTunes.dmg to your hard drive. After 
your browser downloads the file, locate the file in the Finder.
 
2. Open the iTunes installer drive image.
 
 Double-click the iTunes.dmg file to mount the iTunes installation drive.
 
3. Double-click the iTunes.mpkg file to unpack the installer package.
 
 The iTunes.mpkg file is a package containing all the elements of the 
iTunes software and the installation program. After double-clicking this 
package file, a dialog appears that asks whether the installer can run a 
special program to check your computer.
 
4. Click Continue to run the special program.
 
 The installer needs to run a program to check your computer and 
make sure it’s capable of running iTunes. After it runs the program, the 
installer displays the Introduction page.
 
5. Click Continue, read the Read Me page, and click Continue again.
 
 The installer displays important Read Me information about the latest 
iTunes features. If you like, click Save to save the page as a document 
or click Print to print it. Click Continue to continue to the License 
Agreement.
 
6. Read the License Agreement and click Continue to go to the second 
page. Click the Agree button and then click Continue again.
 
 To read the entire agreement, you’ll need to scroll down. You must 
choose to accept the agreement by clicking the Agree button, or the 
installer goes no further. After clicking Agree, the installer displays the 
Select a Destination page.
 
7. (Optional) Before you click the Agree button, you can click Save to 
save the license agreement as a document or click Print to print it.

40
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
8. Select the Mac OS X startup drive as the destination volume and then 
click Continue.
 
 The installer asks for the destination volume (hard drive), which must be 
a Mac OS X startup drive. Any other drive is marked by a red exclama-
tion point, indicating that you can’t install the software there. iTunes is 
installed in the Applications folder on the Mac OS X startup drive, and 
the iPod Software Updater is installed in the Utilities folder inside the 
Applications folder.
 
9. Click Install (or Upgrade) to proceed with the installation.
 
 After clicking Install, Mac OS X asks for the system administrator pass-
word. Supply your password, and click OK.
 
10. Click Close when the installer finishes.
You can now launch iTunes by double-clicking the iTunes application or 
clicking the iTunes icon on the Dock. 
The first time you launch iTunes, yet another Apple License Agreement 
appears. You must click Agree to continue (or cancel). After clicking Agree, 
iTunes displays the iTunes Setup Assistant — to get started, click Next.
The Setup Assistant displays the option to Add MP3 and AAC Files; select this 
option to copy music files (without changing their current locations) into the 
iTunes library (see Chapter 5 for descriptions of these formats). After select-
ing (or not selecting) this option, click Next to continue.
The Setup Assistant then asks if you want to keep your music folder orga-
nized. Choose Yes to keep the iTunes Music Folder organized, and click Next 
to continue. (For more information on how the iTunes Music Folder works,, 
see Chapter 12.) The Setup Assistant then displays a screen explaining how 
album artwork is downloaded (you need an iTunes Store account — see 
Chapter 4) — click Next to continue. Finally the Setup Assistant asks if you 
want to go directly to the iTunes Store. Choose Yes to go directly to the 
store, or No to go directly to your iTunes library, and click Finish.
Setting Up Your iPod or iPhone
When you connect a new iPod or iPhone for the first time, iTunes displays the 
Register and Set Up screen. Follow these steps to set up your iPod or iPhone:
 
1. With iTunes open, connect your iPod or iPhone to the computer with 
a USB cable (or FireWire cable for an older iPod model).
 
 iTunes recognizes your iPod or iPhone and opens the Register and Set 
Up screen to get you started. If your iPod or iPhone isn’t recognized in 
five minutes, see Chapter 21.

41
 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
 
2. Click Continue (or click Register Later to skip the registration process).
 
 iTunes displays the iPod Software License Agreement. You can scroll 
down to read it if you wish. You must choose to accept the agreement, 
or the installer goes no further.
 
3. Click the option to accept the terms at the end of the License 
Agreement, and then click Continue. 
 
 After clicking Continue (which is active only if you accept), iTunes lets 
you register your iPod or iPhone with Apple online so you can take 
advantage of Apple support. iTunes displays a screen for entering your 
Apple ID; a membership ID for the MobileMe (formerly .Mac) service is 
also valid. If you purchased your iPod or iPhone directly from Apple or 
have an Apple iTunes Store account, you already have an Apple ID. Enter 
that ID and password and then click Continue to swiftly move through 
the registration process — Apple automatically recognizes your pur-
chase. If you bought your iPod or iPhone elsewhere or you don’t have 
an Apple ID or MobileMe ID, select the I Do Not Have an Apple ID radio 
button and then click Continue to get to the page for entering your iPod 
or iPhone serial number and your personal information. Fields marked 
with an asterisk (*) are required, such as your name and e-mail address. 
 
 If you don’t already have an iTunes Store account, the Setup Assistant is 
going to ask you to set up such an account right now, as part of your iPod 
setup. Chapter 4 has all the details on setting up an iTunes Store account.. 
  
4. Click Continue to advance through each screen in the registration pro-
cess, and then click Submit at the end to submit your information. 
 
 After clicking Submit, iTunes displays a screen that lets you enter a 
name for your iPod or iPhone.
 
5. Give your iPod or iPhone a name, set the automatic options, and then 
click Done (on a Mac) or Finish (on Windows).
 
 When it comes to setting automatic options, here’s the deal: 
 
• Automatically sync songs and videos, or automatically choose songs: 
If you want to copy your entire iTunes music and video library onto 
your iPod or iPhone, leave the Automatically Sync Songs and Videos 
option selected. This option creates a mirror image of your music 
and video library on the iPod or iPhone, including all playlists and 
audio files. (You can always change this setting later; see Chapter 11.) 
If your iPod or iPhone can’t hold your entire library, iTunes chooses 
songs for you, based on your ratings and how often you’ve played 
them. (To find out how to add ratings, see Chapter 9.) If you want to 
control which portion of your library to copy to the iPod, deselect 
this option, and turn to Chapter 11 for synchronization details.
 
• Automatically add photos: Select this option to copy all the photos 
in your Pictures folder or photo library to your iPod or iPhone. 
(See Chapter 11 for information about synchronizing photo librar-
ies.) Leave it deselected if you want to transfer photos later.

42
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
• Automatically sync applications: Select this option (iPod touch and 
iPhone only) to copy all applications in your iTunes library to your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
 
• For an iPod shuffle: iTunes displays an option to copy songs randomly. 
If you leave the Automatically Choose Songs for My iPod option 
selected, iTunes copies a random selection of songs to your iPod 
shuffle. You can always choose to fill your iPod shuffle with a different 
selection by clicking the Autofill button, as I describe in Chapter 11.
After finishing setup, your iPod or iPhone name appears in the iTunes Source 
pane (the left column) under the Devices subheading, as shown in Figure 2-3. 
If you chose the option to automatically synchronize your songs and videos, 
your iPod or iPhone quickly fills up with music and videos from your iTunes 
music library. Of course, if you’re just starting out, you probably have no 
tunes in your library. Your next step is to import music from CDs, buy music 
and videos online, or import music and videos from other sources.
Don’t want to add songs or videos now? If you deselect the automatically syn-
chronize option, you can still add songs and videos later, along with podcasts 
and audiobooks — either manually or automatically, as I describe in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
You can leave your iPod or iPhone connected to the computer, using the 
computer as a source of power — the iPod or iPhone appears in iTunes 
whenever you start iTunes. However, you might not want to leave it con-
nected. If you have an alternative power source for your iPod or iPhone, dis-
connect it from iTunes and your computer by ejecting it. To eject your iPod 
or iPhone, click the eject button next to the iPod or iPhone name (refer to 
Figure 2-4) in the Source pane.
 
After ejecting the iPod or iPhone, wait for its display to show the main menu 
or the OK to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod or 
iPhone from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod or iPhone before 
ejecting it because such bad behavior might cause it to freeze up and require 
a reset. (If that happens, see Chapter 20 for instructions.)
Downloading and Installing 
Software Upgrades
Apple upgrades iTunes and the built-in iPod and iPhone software regularly to 
add new features and fix bugs.
The best way to stay updated with the latest version is to get in the habit of 
downloading and installing upgrades over the Internet. Here’s how it’s done:
 
1. Choose Check for Updates from the iTunes Edit menu on a Windows 
PC, or Software Update from the iTunes menu on a Mac.
 
 iTunes automatically accesses the Internet and checks for an update. If 
a new version is available, a dialog appears, asking whether you want to 
download it.
 
 You can set your Mac or Windows PC to automatically check for the 
latest version of iTunes. Choose Preferences from the iTunes menu on a 
Mac or from the Edit menu on a PC, click the General tab, and select the 
Check for Updates Automatically check box to turn on that feature.
 
2. If iTunes displays a dialog with the message that a new version of 
iTunes is available and asks whether you want to download it now, 
click Yes.
 
• On a Windows PC: iTunes launches your Web browser and takes you 
right to the iTunes download page (refer to Figure 2-1). Follow the 
instructions in “Installing iTunes on a Windows PC” in this chapter.
 
• On a Mac: iTunes automatically downloads and installs the 
upgrade. When you start iTunes after installing an upgrade, you 
must click the option to agree to Apple’s License Agreement. 
iTunes then starts as usual.

44
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
3. After installing the iTunes upgrade, connect your iPod or iPhone to 
your computer as you normally do.
 
 iTunes automatically detects new iPod or iPhone software if it’s avail-
able, and replaces the Check for Update button on the iPod or iPhone 
Summary page (refer to Figure 2-3) with an Update button.
 
4. Click the Update button to install the software in your iPod or iPhone.
 
 iTunes displays information about the new iPod or iPhone software.
 
5. Click Next to continue to the Apple License Agreement, and click the 
option to agree with it.
 
 iTunes automatically installs the update into your iPod or iPhone. After 
your iPod or iPhone is set up and updated with the newest version of its 
software, you’re ready to find out what iTunes can do for you.

M
ore than half a century ago, jukeboxes were the primary and most 
convenient way for people to select the music they wanted to hear 
and share with others, especially newly released music. Juke joints were hop-
ping with the newest hits every night. You could pick any song to play at any 
time, but you had to insert a coin and pay for each play. Radio eventually 
supplanted the jukebox as the primary means of releasing new music to the 
public, and the music was free to hear — but you couldn’t choose to play any 
song you wanted at any time.
Today, using iTunes, you not only have a digital jukebox and a radio in 
your computer, but you also have online access to millions of songs and 
thousands of podcasts, TV shows, movies, and audio books. Connect your 
computer to a stereo amplifier in your home (through wires or Apple TV), 
or connect speakers to your computer, and suddenly your computer is the 
best jukebox in the neighborhood. Connect your computer to a television, 
and you have a full multimedia environment in your home, all controlled by 
iTunes. And after you’ve organized your content in iTunes, you can put it all 
on your iPod to carry your jukebox with you.
This chapter gives you an overview of what you can do with iTunes, and you 
get started in the simplest way possible: using iTunes to play music tracks on 
a CD. You can use iTunes just like a jukebox, only better — you don’t have to 
pay for each song you play, and you can play some or all of the songs on an 
album in any order.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
The most up-to-date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 8. 
However, software updates occur very rapidly. If you really want the latest 
version, go directly to the Apple Web site to get it, as I describe in Chapter 2.
What You Can Do with iTunes
You can purchase songs or entire albums, audio books, TV shows, movies, 
and other videos from the iTunes Store and download them directly into 
your iTunes library (as I describe in Chapter 4), or you can copy these items 
from other sources (including audio CDs) into your iTunes library (as I 
describe in Chapter 5). You can also subscribe to podcasts that transfer audio 
or audio/video episodes, such as weekly broadcasts, automatically to your 
iTunes library from the Internet or through the iTunes Store. You can even 
use iTunes to listen to Web radio stations and add your favorite stations to 
your music library. After you store the content in your iTunes library, you 
can play it on your computer and transfer it to iPod, Apple TV, and iPhone 
models. You can also burn the audio content onto an audio CD or copy audio 
and video files onto other hard drives or DVD data discs as backups.
Transferring songs from a CD to your computer is referred to as ripping a 
CD (to the chagrin of the music industry old-timers who think that users 
intend to destroy the discs or steal the songs). Ripping an entire CD’s worth 
of songs is quick and easy, and track information, such as artist name and 
title, arrives automatically over the Internet for most commercial CDs. (You 
can add the information yourself for rare CDs, custom-mix CDs, live CDs, and 
others that are unknown to the database.)
You can also add video files to your iTunes library in a couple of ways: by 
choosing content from the iTunes Store (such as TV shows, feature-length 
high-definition movies, music videos, and even free movie trailers) or by 
downloading standard video files in the MPEG-4 format from other sources 
on the Internet. You can also create your own videos with a digital cam-
corder (or cameras built into computers, such as the iSight camera included 
with MacBooks) and copy them to iTunes.
 
Although you can’t use iTunes to transfer video content from a DVD, you can 
use other software to convert DVDs to digital video files, and you can transfer 
video content from older VHS players by using a digital video camcorder. Visit 
this book’s companion Web site for more details.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes
As if that weren’t enough, iTunes gives you the power to organize content 
into playlists. (You can even set up dynamic, smart playlists that reflect your 
preferences and listening habits.) It even has a built-in equalizer with preset 
settings for all kinds of music and listening environments, with the added 
bonus of being able to customize and save your own personalized settings 
with each item of content.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes are virtually identical, with the 
exception that dialogs and icons look a bit different between the two operat-
ing systems. There are also a few other differences, mostly related to the 
different operating environments. The Windows version lets you import 
unprotected Windows Media (WMA) songs; the Mac version, like most Mac 
applications, can be controlled by AppleScript programs. Nevertheless, as 
Apple continues to improve iTunes, the company releases upgrades to both 
versions at the same time, and the versions are free to download.
Opening the iTunes Window
You can run iTunes anytime (with or without an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV) 
to build and manage your library of music, audio books, podcasts, Web 
radio stations, TV shows, and other videos. You don’t have to connect your 
iPod or iPhone until you’re ready to transfer content to it (as I describe in 
Chapter 11).
When you launch iTunes, your library and other sources of content appear. 
Figure 3-1 shows the iTunes window on a PC running Windows XP, using the 
List pane in Browse view to browse by artist. To see this view, click the left-
most View button (refer to Figure 3-1) and choose View➪Show Browser. (To 
hide the top Browser, choose View➪Hide Browser.) You can then click the 
column headings in the List pane to sort your library by artist, album title, or 
any of the other view options.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes look nearly identical and offer the 
same functions and viewing options, including the cover browser (also known 
as Cover Flow). Figure 3-2 shows the iTunes window on the Mac with the 
cover browser open, displaying the cover art for albums. Both versions also 
offer the Genius sidebar (shown in Figure 3-1 but hidden in Figure 3-2) and 
the Speakers pop-up menu for choosing a speaker system.

iTunes offers a view of your library and your sources for content, as well as 
controls for organizing, importing, and playing content, as follows:
 
 Source pane: Displays the source of content, handily divided into the 
following sections:
 
• Library: Includes your music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, audio books, 
applications and games, ringtones, and all available radio stations
 
• Store: Includes the iTunes Store and your Purchased list

49
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes
 
• Devices: Includes audio CDs (such as the OK Computer CD by 
Radiohead in Figure 3-1), and any iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV 
devices (such as TB’s Apple TV in Figure 3-2) that are connected to 
your computer
 
• Playlists: Includes Party Shuffle and your playlists
 
 Cover browser: Also called Cover Flow, the cover browser lets you flip 
through your cover art to choose songs. You can use the slider to move 
swiftly through your library, or you can click to the right or left of the 
cover in the foreground to move forward or backward in your library.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
 List pane: Depending on the source that’s selected in the Source pane 
under Library, Store, Devices, or Playlists, the List pane (refer to Figure 3-1) 
displays a list of the content in your library, a list of Web radio stations, the 
content available in the iTunes Store, the tracks of a music CD, the entire 
library on your iPod or iPhone, the Party Shuffle list, or any one of your 
playlists. (Versatile guys, aren’t they?)
 
 Genius sidebar: The Genius sidebar (refer to Figure 3-1) makes sug-
gestions for what to get from the iTunes Store based on what you’ve 
selected. There’s no obligation to buy anything, and you can dispense 
with it if it bothers you — you can open or close the Genius sidebar by 
clicking the boxed-arrow Show/Hide Genius sidebar button in the lower-
right corner of the iTunes window. (See the section, “Using the iTunes 
Genius Sidebar,” later in this chapter.)
 
 View buttons: The three buttons in the upper-right corner change your 
view of the List pane to show items in a list, cover art thumbnail images 
in a grid, or the cover browser.
 
 Genius button: The Genius button at the lower-right corner of the 
iTunes window to the left of the Show/Hide Genius sidebar button, gen-
erates a playlist of songs from your library that go great with the song 
you selected. The Genius button appears only when selecting music or a 
playlist — see Chapter 10 for details.
 
 Status pane: When a song, audio book, radio station, podcast, or video 
is playing, you’ll see the artist name, piece title (if known), and the 
elapsed time displayed in this pane.
 
 Search field: Type in this field to search your library. You can also use 
the Search field to peruse a playlist or to look within the iTunes Store.
 
 Player buttons — Forward/Next, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind: 
Use these buttons to control the playback of content in iTunes.
 
 Playlist buttons — Add, Shuffle, Repeat: Use these buttons to add play-
lists and shuffle or repeat playback of playlists.
 
 Speakers pop-up menu: Use this pop-up menu in the lower-right corner 
of the iTunes window to select a different speaker system than the com-
puter’s speakers (see Chapter 6). This pop-up menu appears only if you 
choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or the Edit menu 
in Windows), click the Devices tab, and turn on the Look for Remote 
Speakers Connected with AirTunes option. If iTunes locates the speak-
ers, the pop-up menu appears.
 
 Volume control: You can change the volume level in iTunes by dragging 
the volume control slider in the upper-left section of the iTunes window 
to the right to increase the volume, or to the left to decrease it. The 
maximum volume of the iTunes volume slider is the maximum set for 
the computer’s sound, which you set separately. See Chapter 6 for more 
about setting volume levels.

51
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes
 
 Show/Hide Artwork button: Use this button to display or hide artwork 
(either your own or the artwork supplied with purchased songs and 
videos).
 
 Show/Hide Genius sidebar: Use this button to display or hide the 
Genius sidebar.
 
 Eject button: This button appears next to the name of an audio CD 
or iPod in the Source pane to eject the CD or iPod. Clicking the Eject 
button, um, ejects a CD or an iPod or iPhone. However, whereas a CD 
actually pops out of some computers, iPods and iPhones are hard 
drives, and ejecting them simply removes (unmounts) the drives from 
the system so that you can disconnect them.
If you don’t like the width of the Source pane, you can adjust it by dragging the 
vertical bar between the Source and List panes. You can also adjust the hori-
zontal bar between the song list and browser in the List pane — to show the 
browser, choose View➪Show Browser; to hide it, choose View➪Hide Browser. 
To resize the iTunes window on a Mac, drag diagonally from the bottom-right 
corner. In Windows, drag the edges of the window horizontally or vertically.
Playing CD Tracks in iTunes
iTunes needs content. You can get started right away by ripping music from 
CDs into your library. For more instant gratification, though, you can play 
music right off the CD without importing it. Maybe you don’t want to put the 
music into your library. Maybe you just want to hear it first, as part of your 
Play First, Rip Later plan.
To play a CD, insert any music CD — or even a CD-R that someone burned for 
you — into your computer. After you insert the CD, iTunes displays a dialog 
that asks whether you want to import the CD into your library right now — 
you can click Yes to import now, or No to do nothing yet. Click No for now; 
I show you how to import music in Chapter 5. The iTunes Browse button 
changes to an Import button in anticipation of ripping the CD at any time.
If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes accesses the Gracenote CDDB for 
song information while you are answering the import question, so that after 
you click Yes or No, iTunes presents the track information for each song 
automatically, as shown in Figure 3-3. (Gracenote CDDB is a song database 
on the Internet that knows the track names of most commercial CDs but not 
those of homemade mix CDs. You can read about Gracenote CDDB and edit-
ing song information in Chapter 9.)
When you play a CD in iTunes, it’s just like using a CD player. To play a CD 
from the first track, click the Play button. (If you clicked somewhere else 
after inserting the disc, you might have to click the first track to select it 
before clicking the Play button.) The Play button then turns into a Pause 
button, and the song plays.

52
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
Figure 3-3: 
CD track 
info appears 
after iTunes 
consults the 
Internet.
 
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in 
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the 
Play button) or until the song list ends. You can skip to the next or previous 
song by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking the Forward 
button or the Back button (next to the Play button). You can also double-
click another song in the list to start playing it.
 
You can press the spacebar to perform the same function as clicking the Play 
button; pressing it again is just like clicking the Pause button.
The Status pane above the list of songs tells you the name of the artist and 
the song title as well as the elapsed time of the track. When you click the 
artist name, the artist name is replaced by the album name. The time on the 
left of the slider is the elapsed time; the time on the right is the duration of 
the song. When you click the duration, it changes to the remaining time; click 
it again to return to the song’s duration.
 
Eject a CD by clicking the Eject button or by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc. 
Another way to eject the CD is to click the Eject icon next to the CD name in 
the Source pane. You can also right-click the CD name and choose Eject from 
the contextual menu that appears.
Rearranging and repeating tracks
You can rearrange the order of the tracks to automatically play them in any 
sequence you want, similar to programming a CD player. When you click the 
up arrow at the top of the first column in the List pane (refer to Figure 3-3), it 
changes to a down arrow, and the tracks appear in reverse order.
To change the order of tracks that you’re playing in sequence, just click and 
hold the track number in the leftmost column for the song, and then drag it 
up or down in the list. You can set up the tracks to play in a completely dif-
ferent sequence.

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes
Skipping tracks
To skip tracks so that they don’t play in sequence, deselect the check box 
next to the song names. iTunes skips deselected songs when you play the 
entire sequence.
 
To remove all check marks from a list, press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows 
while clicking a check mark. Select an empty check box while pressing Ô or 
Ctrl to add check marks to the entire list.
Repeating a song list
 
 You can repeat an entire song list by clicking the Repeat button, which you 
can find below the Source pane on the left side of the iTunes window (or by 
choosing Controls➪Repeat All). When it’s selected, the Repeat button shows 
blue highlighting. Click the Repeat button again to repeat the current song 
(or choose Controls➪Repeat One). The button changes to include a blue-
highlighted numeral 1. Click it once more to return to normal playback (or 
choose Controls➪Repeat Off).
 
The Shuffle button, located to the left of the Repeat button, plays the songs in 
the list in random order, which can be fun. You can then press the arrow keys 
on your keyboard or click the Back and Forward buttons to jump around in 
random order.
Displaying visuals
The visual effects in iTunes can turn your iTunes window into a light show 
that’s synchronized to the music in your library. You can watch a cool dis-
play of eye candy while the music plays — or leave it on like a lava lamp.
Choose View➪Show Visualizer to display visual effects (or press Ô-T on a 
Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows). An animation appears in the iTunes window and 
synchronizes with the music. Choose View➪Hide Visualizer (or press Ô-T on 
a Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows) to turn off the visual effects.
iTunes offers two visualizers: The iTunes Visualizer has a simulated 3D look 
that includes spheres, ribbons, and lights that pulsate to the beat and tempo of 
the song you’re playing. The Classic Visualizer, with a 2D look, has been part of 
the application since the beginning. To switch from the iTunes Visualizer to the 
Classic Visualizer, choose View➪Visualizer➪Classic Visualizer. To switch back 
to the new one, choose View➪Visualizer➪iTunes Visualizer.

54
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
You can tweak the Classic Visualizer a bit by changing the Visualizer 
options. Choose View➪Visualizer➪Classic Visualizer, and then choose 
View➪Visualizer➪Options to open the Visualizer Options dialog, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Set options 
for visual 
effects.
 
The Visualizer Options dialog offers the following options that affect the ani-
mation (but not the performance of iTunes when it’s playing music):
 
 Display Frame Rate: Choosing this option displays the frame rate of the 
animation along with the animation, so that you can tell whether it is 
going faster or slower than normal video (30 fps).
 
 Cap Frame Rate at 30 fps: Choosing this option keeps the frame rate 
at 30 fps (frames per second) or lower, which is roughly the speed of 
video, to keep animation from moving too fast.
 
 Always Display Song Info: Choosing this option displays the song name, 
artist, and album for the song currently playing, along with the animation.
 
 Use DirectX (Windows only) or Use OpenGL (Mac only): You can 
choose to use DirectX on a Windows PC or OpenGL on a Mac to display 
very cool animation with faster performance. These are the most widely 
used standards for three-dimensional graphics programming.
 
 Faster but Rougher Display: When you use this option, animation plays 
faster but with rougher graphics. Select this option if your animation 
plays too slowly.
Choosing View➪Full Screen (or pressing Ô-F on a Mac or Ctrl-F in Windows) 
while showing the visualizer sets the visual effects to fill the entire screen. 
When displaying the full-screen visual effects, you can click the mouse button 
or press Escape (Esc) to stop the display and return to iTunes.
 
The Preferences dialog in iTunes lets you set the visualizer to always display 
full-screen. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences in 
Windows, click the Advanced tab, and select the Display Visualizer Full Screen 
option to always display the visualizer in full-screen mode.
While the animated visual effects play, press Shift-/ (as if you’re typing a ques-
tion mark) to see a list of keyboard functions. Depending on the visual effect, 
you might see more choices of keyboard functions by pressing Shift-/ again.

55
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes
 
Figure 3-5: 
Set the 
visualizer

You can enhance iTunes with plug-ins that provide even better visuals. For 
example, SpectroGraph from Dr. Lex displays a spectrogram of the music, and 
Cover Version from imagomat displays the album cover artwork. You can find 
them — and many other enhancements — at Apple’s software download site 
(www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ipod_itunes).
After installing an iTunes plug-in, you can switch from one plug-in to another 
by choosing View➪Visualizer to see the submenu of plug-ins (including 
iTunes Visualizer and Classic Visualizer, supplied with iTunes). 
Using the iTunes Genius Sidebar
If you turn on the iTunes Genius sidebar (refer to Figure 3-1), which appears 
next to the List pane, it makes suggestions for what to buy from the iTunes 
Store based on what you’ve selected. The Genius feature also activates the 
Genius button for creating the Genius playlist. (See Chapter 10 for details on 
using the Genius button.)
The Genius sidebar will try to skip songs that are already in your library 
in order to show you songs you might want to buy; but it’s not perfect and 
sometimes doesn’t recognize that you already have the song (especially if 
you ripped the song from CD).

56
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
The Genius informs the online store about the songs you select whenever 
the Genius sidebar is open. It then shows you music that other listeners 
purchased when they purchased the music you’re playing. You can click any 
item in the Genius sidebar to go right to the iTunes Store page for that item. 
See Chapter 4 for details about using the iTunes Store.
The Genius sidebar operates only if you give it permission and if you already 
have an iTunes Store account. (To open an account, see Chapter 4.) When 
you first start iTunes, the sidebar is not yet turned on. (Refer to Figure 3-1.) 
To turn it on, click the Turn on Genius button, enter your Apple ID and pass-
word for your iTunes Store account, and click Continue. If you don’t have 
an account yet, select the Create a New iTunes Store Account option and 
choose your country from the country pop-up menu. Then click Continue. 
See Chapter 4 for further instructions on creating an account.
 
When you have the Genius sidebar open, iTunes transmits information to the 
store about the selection you’re playing. To hide the Genius sidebar (and stop 
transmitting this information), click the Show/Hide Genius sidebar button in 
the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window. (Refer to Figure 3-1.)
If the Genius sidebar can’t find the artist for the song you’re playing, it offers 
choices that are simply in the same genre. The Genius sidebar is available 
only when selecting songs in the Music portion of your library or in playlists. 
If you don’t have an iTunes Store available for your country, you see the U.S. 
store, just as Chuck Berry once sang, “Anything you want, we got right here 
in the U.S.A.”

W
hen Apple announced its online music service, Apple chairman Steve 
Jobs remarked that other services put forward by the music industry 
tend to treat consumers like criminals. Steve had a point. Many of these ser-
vices cost more and add a level of copy protection that prevents consumers 
from burning more than one CD or using the music (that they bought) on 
other computers or portable MP3 players.
Record labels dragged their feet for years, experimenting with online sales 
and taking legal action against online sites that allowed free downloads and 
music copying. Although the free music attracted millions of listeners, the 
free services were under legal attack in several countries, and the digital 
music that was distributed wasn’t of the highest quality (not to mention the 
widespread and sometimes intentional misspellings in the song information 
and artist names). Consumers grew even warier when the Record Industry 
Association of America (RIAA), a lobbying organization looking out for the 
interests of record companies, began legal proceedings (illegal copyright 
infringement) against people who possibly thought they were downloading 
free music.
No one should go to jail for being a music junkie. Consumers and the industry 
both needed a solution. Apple did the research on how to make a service that 
worked better and was easier to use, and the company forged ahead with the 
iTunes Store. By all accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering the easiest, 
fastest, and most cost-effective service for buying content online.

58
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
When Apple first introduced the online store, it was called the iTunes Music 
Store. Although Apple has sold more than five billion songs as of June 2008, 
the company dropped Music from its title because the iTunes Store sells much 
more. You can purchase or rent movies, including HD movies, and you can 
purchase TV shows, music videos, applications, and games to play on your 
iPod or iPhone. You can buy content from the iTunes Store directly from your 
iPod touch or iPhone, and you can use the online App Store to download free 
or commercial applications — in many categories, including gaming, social net-
working, sports, and more — directly to your iPod touch or iPhone.
The iTunes Store offers parental controls that let you disable various sec-
tions as well as limit the purchase of various contents based on PG/TV rat-
ings. It also offers an option to immediately burn a disc backup of the content 
you purchased. The iTunes Store offers gift certificates that you can e-mail to 
others and allows accounts that you can set up for others (such as children) 
with credit limits but without the need to use a credit card. In fact, Apple 
adds new features to the iTunes Store almost every week.
This chapter shows you how to sign in and take advantage of what the iTunes 
Store has to offer.
Visiting the iTunes Store
You can visit the iTunes Store by connecting to the Internet and using 
iTunes. You can also click an iTunes Store link on Apple’s Web site, or a 
similar link on any other Web sites that are iTunes affiliates with songs for 
sale (such as www.rockument.com). The link automatically launches your 
installed copy of iTunes and opens the iTunes Store.
As of this writing, the iTunes Store offers millions of songs, with most songs 
available for download for 99 cents each and entire albums available for down-
load at less than the CD price. You can play these copy-protected songs on up to 
five different computers; burn CDs; and use the songs on an unlimited number of 
iPods, iPhones, or Apple TVs. Apple also offers “iTunes Plus” songs and albums 
from some record labels with higher sound quality and without copy protection. 
You can play iTunes Plus songs on any player that supports the AAC format, and 
on an unlimited number of computers and burn CDs with them.
You can buy audio books and episodes and entire seasons of TV shows, and you 
can purchase them in advance, so you see them immediately. First-run movies 
are available for rent or purchase. iTunes also offers tons of free content in the 
form of podcasts, which are similar to syndicated radio and TV shows, but you 
can download and play them at your convenience on your computer and on 
your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV. iTunes even offers free lectures, language les-
sons, and audio books with educational content in its iTunes U section.

59
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
Like with most online services, the music that you buy online isn’t as high in 
audio quality as music on a commercial CD, although most people can’t tell 
the difference when playing the music on car stereos or at low volume. The 
quality of the music sold in the iTunes Store is comparable with the quality 
you get when ripping CDs or importing songs using the MP3 or AAC formats. 
You also get song information (such as artist, song titles, the album title, and 
cover artwork), and the iTunes Store provides electronic liner notes for some 
albums, just like the printed notes you sometimes find on a commercial CD. 
Some albums are provided with the electronic equivalent of a complete jewel 
case booklet that you can print yourself.
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, and why iTunes uses them 
to reduce the space the music occupies on the hard drive or flash memory of 
your iPod or iPhone, visit this book’s companion Web site.
 
The iTunes Store is part of iTunes version 4 and newer, but you should be 
using the newest version of iTunes, and I describe how to get it in Chapter 2.
With the iTunes Store, you can preview any song for up to 30 seconds. Some 
movies offer one-minute previews and movie trailers you can view for free, 
and TV shows and audio books can offer up to 90 seconds. 
If you have an account set up, you can buy and download content immedi-
ately, including movies for rent. I don’t know of a faster way to purchase or 
rent content.
If you already have your iTunes program open, you have at least three 
choices when it comes to opening the iTunes Store:
 
 Click iTunes Store in the Store section of the Source pane. The iTunes 
Store home page opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
 Click any link in the Genius sidebar. The iTunes Store home page 
opens and automatically switches your Source pane selection to iTunes 
Store. The Genius sidebar offers suggestions based on the music you 
select in your library; see Chapter 3 for details.
 
 Follow a content link in iTunes. Click the content link (the gray-circled 
arrow next to a song or video title, an artist name, or an album title) to 
go to an iTunes Store page related to the song or video, artist, or album. 
iTunes searches the iTunes Store based on the item you selected. If 
nothing closely related turns up, at least you end up in the iTunes Store, 
and you might even find music you like that you didn’t know about.
 
If you need to fire up your modem and log on to your Internet service to go 
online, do so before clicking the iTunes Store option or following a content 
link — otherwise iTunes will wait for an Internet connection for a while and 
eventually give up.

The iTunes Store uses the iTunes List pane to display its wares. You can 
check out content to your heart’s content, although you can’t buy content or 
rent movies unless you have an iTunes Store account set up. You can use the 
Choose Genre pop-up menu to specify music genres, or you can click links for 
new releases, exclusive tracks, and so on.
The iTunes Store also provides buttons on a gray bar just above the adver-
tised content in the List pane. The left and right triangle buttons work just 
like the Back and Forward buttons of a Web browser, moving back a page or 
forward a page, respectively. The button with the Home icon takes you to the 
iTunes Store home page. 
Setting Up an Account
You need an account to purchase content or rent movies. To create an 
iTunes Store account, follow these steps:

61
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
 
1. In iTunes, click the iTunes Store option in the Store section of the 
Source pane, or click a music link or Genius sidebar link.
 
 The iTunes Store home page appears (refer to Figure 4-1), replacing the 
iTunes List pane.
 
2. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right area of the window to 
create an account (or sign in to an existing account).
 
 When you’re logged in to an iTunes account, the account name appears 
in place of the Sign In button.
 
 After you click the Sign In button, iTunes displays the account sign-in 
dialog, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
 If you already set up an account with the iTunes Store with the 
MobileMe (formerly .Mac) service or with other Apple services (such as 
the Apple Developer Connection), you’re halfway there. Type your ID 
and password and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the 
personal information that you put in previously, so you don’t have to 
re-enter it every time you visit the iTunes Store. If you forgot your pass-
word, click the Forgot Password? button, and iTunes provides a dialog 
to answer your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes e-mails 
your password to you.

 iTunes displays a new page, replacing the iTunes Store home page with 
a page welcoming you to the iTunes Store.
 
4. Click Continue on the iTunes Store welcome page.
 
 After you click Continue, the terms of use appear with the option at the 
end to agree to the terms.

click Continue. 
 
 iTunes displays the next page of the setup procedure, shown in Figure 4-3.

6. Fill in your personal account information in the new page that appears.
 
 You need to enter your e-mail address, password, test question and 
answer (in case you forget your password), birth date, and privacy 
options.

7. Click Continue and then enter your credit card information.
 
 The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The iTunes 
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card infor-
mation) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
 
8. Click Continue to finish the procedure.
 
 The account setup finishes and returns you to the iTunes Store home 
page. You can now use the iTunes Store to purchase and download con-
tent to play in iTunes and use on any iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
Select a country from the My Store pop-up menu at the bottom of the iTunes 
Store page to choose online stores in other countries. For example, the 
iTunes Store in France displays menus in French and features hit songs and 
TV shows for the French market. If you’ve set up your account in only one 
country (such as the United States), you have to set an account up again for 
the country you’re switching to, in order to purchase content in that coun-
try’s store. You can set up multiple accounts in multiple countries.

63
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
 
Click the flag button next to the My Store pop-up menu at the bottom of the 
iTunes Store home page to display a page of buttons with flags of other coun-
tries; then click one to go to the home page for the iTunes Store for that country.
Browsing and Previewing Songs
The iTunes Store home page is loaded with specials and advertisements to 
peruse. To look at music in more depth, choose Music from the iTunes Store 
panel at the top left of the home page (next to the New Releases panel). 
iTunes displays more panels of advertisements and specials for music lovers. 
You can then choose a genre from the Genres pop-up menu on the iTunes 
Store panel to see only those specials and ads for a particular genre.
What if you’re looking for particular music in a particular genre? You can 
browse the iTunes Store by genre and artist name in a method similar to 
browsing your iTunes library. 
To browse the iTunes Store, choose View➪Show Browser, or click the Browse 
link in the Quick Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page. 
iTunes displays the store’s offerings categorized by type of content (such 
as Music), and it displays music by genre and subgenre — and within each 
subgenre, by artist and album. Select a genre in the Genre column, then a sub-
genre in the Subgenre column, then an artist in the Artist column, and finally 
an album in the Album column, which takes you to the list of songs from that 
album that are available to preview or purchase, as shown in Figure 4-4.
To see more information about a song or the album that it came from, click 
the content link (one of the gray-circled arrow buttons in the List pane):
 
 Clicking the arrow in the Artist column takes you to the artist’s page of 
albums.
 
 Clicking the arrow in the Album column takes you to the album page.
 
 Clicking the arrow in the Name column takes you to album page with the 
song highlighted.
 
My only complaint about browsing by artist is that artists are listed alphabeti-
cally by first name. For example, you have to look up Bob Dylan under Bob 
and not Dylan.
To preview a song, click the song title in the List pane and then click the Play 
button (or press the spacebar) or double-click the song.
By default, the previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream, 
so you might hear a few hiccups in the playback. Each preview lasts about 30 
seconds. Just when you start really getting into the song, it ends. If the song 
is irresistible, though, you can buy it on the spot.

Figure 4-4: 
Browse the 
iTunes Store 
for music by 
genre, artist, 
and album.
 
If you know specifically what you’re looking for, you can search instead of 
browse. The Search field in the top-right corner of the iTunes window lets 
you search the iTunes Store for just about anything. You can type part of a 
song title or artist name to quickly search the iTunes Store, or use the Power 
Search feature to narrow your search. (See the “Power searching” section 
later in this chapter.)
To return to the store’s home menu, click the Home icon on the gray bar just 
above the advertised content in the List pane.
Power searching
You’re serious about your content, and you truly desire the power to search 
for exactly what you want. I know what you want — and I have the function 
right here for you.
Click the Power Search link on the iTunes Store home page in the Quick Links 
panel to go directly to the Power Search page (or choose Store➪Search). At 
the top of the Power Search page, as shown in Figure 4-5, you can choose the 
type of content to search through: All (search all types), Music, Movies, TV 
Shows, Music Videos, Audiobooks, Podcasts, or iTunes U (part of the iTunes 
Store that offers free lectures, language lessons, and audio books). Each con-
tent type has a particular set of entry fields for searching.

65
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
Choose Music to power-search for music. The entry fields for Artist, Composer, 
Song, and Album appear. You can fill in some or all of these fields (see Figure 
4-5) or just fill in part of any field (such as Composer or Artist) if that’s all you 
know. You can narrow your search by picking a genre from the Genre pop-up 
menu. You can also narrow your search by picking only iTunes Plus songs 
(which offer higher sound quality and are stripped of copy protection) — click 
to turn on the Search iTunes Plus option. If you want to find only songs that 
can be made into ringtones for your iPhone, click to turn on the Search Songs 
that can be Made into Ringtones option.
After you fill in as much as you know (and have perhaps narrowed your 
search, if that’s what you wanted), click the Search button. The songs appear 
below in the list.
Browsing celebrity and published playlists
Do you want to be influenced? Do you want to know what influenced some of 
today’s celebrities and buy what they have in their record collections? Choose 
Music from the iTunes Store panel (on the left) to go to the Music page. Scroll 
down the iTunes Store Music page and click a celebrity name in the Celebrity 
Playlists panel to go to that celebrity’s page. A typical celebrity playlist offers 
about an album’s worth of songs from different artists. You can preview or buy 
any song in the list or follow the music links to the artist or album page.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Use Power 
Search 
to find a

66
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
The Music page advertises some of the celebrity playlists, but a lot more 
are available (more than 480 the last time I checked). To see all the celebrity 
playlists, go to the More in Music panel on the left side of the Music page and 
click the Celebrity Playlists link. You arrive at the Celebrity Playlists page. 
You can use the Sort By pop-up menu in the upper-right corner to sort the 
list by Most Recent or by Title.
You can also be influenced by other buyers and do a little influencing your-
self. Go to the Music page and click the iMix link in the More in Music panel 
on the left side to check out playlists that have been contributed by other 
consumers and published in the iTunes Store. iMixes offer 30-second pre-
views of any songs in the iMix playlists. To find out how to publish your own 
iMix playlist, see Chapter 10.
 
You can also include a Web link (URL) to an iTunes Store page in an e-mail 
message or other document so the reader can click the link to go directly to 
the iTunes Store page. You can drag the last button on the gray bar just above 
the advertised content that displays the page name — or drag any piece of 
artwork from the page — to an e-mail message or document you’re compos-
ing, and iTunes copies the link. You can also Control-click (Mac) or right-click 
(Windows) the item and choose Copy iTunes Store URL from the contextual 
menu that appears.
Browsing and Previewing Movies, 
TV Shows, Videos, and Audio Books
The uncool thing about video stores — besides the weird people who hang 
out in them — is the lack of any ability to preview videos before you buy 
them. And the only way to preview TV shows is to watch TV. However, you 
can use the iTunes Store to preview movies, music videos, and TV shows 
before you buy them (and before you rent a movie) — as long as your com-
puter has a broadband connection to the Internet. Most shows offer 30 sec-
onds of previewing time.
To find TV shows, movies, music videos, or audio books, do one of the 
following:
 
 Click the TV Shows, Movies, Music Videos, or Audiobooks link in the iTunes 
Store panel on the left side of the iTunes Store home page. The iTunes Store 
displays advertisements for the most popular items, and you see a version 
of the cover browser that lets you drag a slider to view items.

67
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
 
 Browse the iTunes Store by clicking the Browse link in the Quick Links 
panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page (or choosing View➪
Show Browser). Select TV Shows, Movies, Music Videos, or Audiobooks 
from the iTunes Store column and then do one of the following:
 
• For a TV show, pick a genre in the Genre column, then a TV show 
in the TV Shows column, and a season of episodes in the Seasons 
column.
 
• For a movie, pick a genre from the Genre column.
 
• For a music video, pick a genre from the Genre column; then pick 
an artist from the Artist column.
 
• For an audio book, pick a genre from the Genre column, then pick 
an author from the Author/Narrator column.
To preview a TV show, movie, or music video, click the title in the list and 
then click the Play button (or press the spacebar). (Movies are actually 
videos on the computer, so I use the term videos from now on.) The video 
plays in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the iTunes window, as 
shown in Figure 4-6. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, click the Show/Hide 
Artwork button to display it. Click the iTunes Play/Pause, Forward/Next, and 
Previous/Rewind buttons to control playback, and use the iTunes volume 
slider to control the volume, just like with songs. For more details about play-
ing videos in iTunes, see Chapter 6.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Play a pre-
view of a 
TV show in

68
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
You can play the video in a larger, separate window by clicking inside the 
Artwork pane while the video is playing. You can then control video playback 
by using the separate window’s controls: Click the right-facing triangle in the 
window to play the video and click it again to pause the video. Drag the slider 
to move forward or backward through the video. You can click the Rewind or 
Fast-Forward buttons in the window to move backward or forward through 
a video. You can also choose options in the View➪Video Size submenu to 
show the video window half-size, actual size, double-size, fit-to-screen, or full 
screen. See Chapter 6 for a full description of video playing options in iTunes.
Movies are also just a click away, as shown in Figure 4-7. Although you can 
click the circled arrow next to the title to go to the movie page, you can also 
use the buttons in the far-left Price column, which include View Movie to 
view the movie trailer; Rent Movie to rent the movie (see “Renting Movies” 
later in this chapter); and Buy Movie to purchase the movie (see “Buying and 
Downloading Content” later in this chapter). Click the View Movie button to 
see the movie’s page. From there, you can click the View Trailer button (see 
Figure 4-8) to see the theatrical trailer. The page also offers buttons to rent or 
buy the movie, if the movie is available for rental or purchase.
 
Clicking the View Trailer button does the obvious — it plays the movie trailer. 
At any time or after the movie trailer plays, though, you can return to the 
movie page by clicking Close Preview under the lower-right corner of the 
trailer picture.

Audio books can be even more entertaining than movies and certainly easier 
to consume while driving or walking. The Audiobooks link on the iTunes Store 
home page takes you to the Audiobooks page. Click an advertisement, thumb-
nail, or title, or click the circled arrow next to the title in a list of titles, to go to 
the specific audio book’s page. Then click the Preview button to preview the 
audio book. Use the Play/Pause button to pause and resume playback.
 
You can double-click the iTunes Store option in the Store section of the Source 
pane to open the iTunes Store in a separate window. With two windows, you 
can use the first window to search for and play content in your library while 
using the second to browse the iTunes Store and purchase and download 
a video. The first window stops playing content when you use the second 
window to preview a song or video.
Browsing and Subscribing to Podcasts
Podcasting is a popular method of publishing audio and video shows to the 
Internet, enabling people to subscribe to a feed and receive the shows auto-
matically. Similar to a tape of a radio broadcast, you can save a podcast epi-
sode and play it back at your convenience, both in iTunes on your computer 
and on your iPod. You can also burn a podcast episode on an audio CD or 

70
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
MP3 CD. A podcast episode can be anything from a single song to a commen-
tary-hosted radio show; a podcaster, like a broadcaster, provides a stream of 
episodes over time. Thousands of professional and amateur radio and video 
shows are offered as podcast episodes.
The iTunes Podcast page on the iTunes Store lets you browse, find, pre-
view, and subscribe to podcasts, many of which are free. You don’t need an 
account to browse the iTunes Store and subscribe to free podcasts.
To find podcasts in the iTunes Store, do one of the following:
 
 Click the Podcasts link in the iTunes Store panel on the left side of the 
home page. The iTunes Store displays the Podcast page, with advertise-
ments for popular podcasts and a list of Top Podcasts in the far-right 
column. You can click the Top Podcasts link to see the most popular 
podcasts in specific categories.
 
 You can also get to the Podcast page by clicking Podcasts in the iTunes 
Source pane and then clicking Podcast Directory at the bottom of the 
List view.
 
 Browse all podcasts in a particular category. Click the Browse link 
in the Quick Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home 
page (or choose View➪Show Browser), and then select Podcasts in 
the iTunes Store column. Select options from the Category column and 
Subcategory column.
 
 Search for a podcast by name or keyword. You can type a search term 
into the Search iTunes Store field in the upper-right corner of the iTunes 
window to find any podcasts or other content items that match. You can 
also use the Power Search feature, described earlier in this chapter in 
the section, “Power searching.”
After you select a podcast, the iTunes Store displays the podcast’s specific 
page in the iTunes Store, as shown in Figure 4-9, with all available podcast 
episodes in the List pane. (There are four episodes in Figure 4-9 for the 
Rockument podcast.)
To select, play, and subscribe to a podcast, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a podcast in the iTunes Store.
 
 The iTunes Store offers a description, a Subscribe button to receive new 
podcasts, and a link to the podcast’s Web site for more information. The 
page also lists the most recent podcast. Some podcasters offer several 
podcasts in one feed. You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast 
listing margin to display separate information about the podcast.

2. To preview the podcast, click the Play button or press the spacebar.
 
 You can play a preview of any podcast in the list. iTunes plays the pod-
cast for about 90 seconds, just like a Web radio station streaming to 
your computer. To jump ahead in a podcast or play the entire podcast 
episode, you must first subscribe to the podcast. By subscribing, you 
enable downloading episodes to your computer.
 
3. Click the Subscribe button to subscribe to the podcast.
 
 In typical Apple fashion, iTunes first displays an alert to confirm that 
you want to subscribe to the podcast.
 
4. Click OK to confirm.
 
 iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to 
Podcasts in the Library section of the Source pane. iTunes displays your 
newly subscribed podcast in the List pane, as shown in Figure 4-10.
 
5. (Optional) Get more episodes of the podcast.
 
 When you subscribe to a podcast, you get the current episode. However, 
each podcast can contain multiple episodes. To download previously 
available episodes, click the triangle next to the podcast name in the List 
pane (refer to Figure 4-10) to see the individual episodes, and then click 
the Get button next to an episode to download it. For more information 
about adding and deleting podcasts and podcast episodes, see Chapter 5.

 A blue dot next to a podcast means you haven’t yet played it. As soon as 
you start listening to a podcast, the dot disappears. For more informa-
tion about playing podcasts, see Chapter 6.
Anyone can create a podcast and then submit it to the iTunes Store by fol-
lowing Apple’s published guidelines. (Click the Submit a Podcast link on the 
Podcast page in the iTunes Store.) In fact, the Rockument and the Flying 
Other Brothers music podcasts, available in the iTunes Store (and from www.
rockument.com), are produced by this book’s author. You can find out 
more about creating podcasts in Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Tee 
Morris and Evo Terra (Wiley).
You can play the podcast, incorporate it into playlists, and make copies and 
burn CDs as much as you like. See Chapter 5 for details on subscribing to, 
deleting, and updating podcasts.
Browsing Applications and Games
Got an iPod touch or iPhone? You can get loads of free and commercial 
applications that run on your iPod touch or iPhone just like built-in applica-
tions like Map and Weather. To find thousands of applications and games 
you can download to iTunes and transfer to your iPod touch or iPhone, click 
App Store in the iTunes Store panel on the iTunes Store home page. Click an 
application’s icon to go to the information page for that application, which 
may also contain reviews and a slideshow depicting the application in action. 
The information page offers the Buy App button to purchase and download 
a commercial application or game, or the Get App button to download a free 
application or game.

73
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
The iTunes Store also offers colorful “click wheel” games to play on your iPod 
classic or nano (or fifth-generation iPods) — all kinds of games, from Mini 
Golf, Monopoly, and Mahjong to the classic Tetris and Cubis 2. You can even 
play the wildly popular Japanese puzzle Sudoku. The games play on iPods 
that can play videos — not in iTunes itself. However, you can see a preview 
of the game while browsing the iTunes Store.
To find the iPod games, click the iPod Games link in the iTunes Store panel 
on the iTunes Store home page. iTunes displays the iPod Games page with 
thumbnail icons for each game. Click the game’s icon to go to the games 
page. Click the Preview button on the game’s page to see a preview of the 
game. Use the iTunes Play button, just as you would for a song, to play the 
game preview. At any time or after the preview plays, click the Close Preview 
button to return to the games page.
Buying and Downloading Content
As you select content, you can purchase the items and download them to 
your computer immediately. Alternatively, you can gather your selections in 
a virtual shopping cart first to see your choices and decide whether to pur-
chase them before downloading them all at once.
 
Each time you buy content, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Store with the 
purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what you bought.
 
Your decision to download each item immediately or add to a shopping 
cart and download later is likely based on how your computer connects 
to the Internet. If you have a slow connection such as a phone line, you prob-
ably want to use the shopping cart to avoid tying up the phone with each 
download.
Using 1-Click
Apple offers 1-Click technology in the iTunes Store so that with one click, 
your digital content immediately starts downloading to your computer — and 
the purchase is done.
With 1-Click, you click the Buy button whether the item is a song, an album, 
a TV show episode, or an audio book. For example, if you select a song in the 
List pane, click the Buy Song button in the far-right column for the song. (You 
might have to scroll your iTunes Store window to see the far-right column.) 
When you select a TV show episode, click the Buy Episode button in the 
far-right column. You can click the Buy Album button in an album advertise-
ment. With 1-Click, iTunes complies immediately.

74
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
The iTunes Store may prompt you to log in to your account first after you 
click the Buy button (unless you just recently logged in). It then displays 
a warning dialog to make sure that you want to buy the item, and you can 
then go through with it or cancel. If you click the Buy button to purchase it, 
the song, album, audio book, or video download automatically shows up in 
your iTunes library. The iTunes Store keeps track of your purchases over a 
24-hour period and charges you for a total sum rather than for each single 
purchase.
 
1-Click seems more like two clicks. If you really want to use only one click 
to buy an item from iTunes, select the Don’t Warn Me option in the warning 
dialog so that you never see it again. (But then don’t complain if you click a 
Buy button by mistake and automatically buy something.)
Using the shopping cart
You don’t have to use the 1-Click technology. Instead, you can add items to 
the shopping cart to delay purchasing and downloading until you’re ready. 
With the shopping cart, the iTunes Store remembers your selections, allow-
ing you to browse the iTunes Store at different times and add to your total 
without making any purchases final. You can also remove items from the cart 
at any time. When you’re ready to buy, you can purchase and download the 
items in your cart in one fell swoop.
If you switch to the shopping cart method (see the following section, 
“Changing your iTunes Store preferences”), the Buy button changes to an 
Add button — as in Add Song, Add Album, Add Episode, and so on. After 
adding items, you can view the selections in your shopping cart by selecting 
the Shopping Cart option underneath the iTunes Store option in the Store 
section of the Source pane (see Figure 4-11).
The shopping cart appears in the List view with your selections listed, and 
recommendations from the iTunes Store appear along the top of the window. 
Albums appear with a triangle next to their name, which you can click to 
open and see the album’s songs. As you can see in Figure 4-11, albums, indi-
vidual songs, music videos, TV episodes, and audio books are listed in alpha-
betical order by artist name (or TV show name).
When you’re ready to purchase everything in your shopping cart, click the 
BUY NOW button in the lower-right corner of the Shopping Cart view to 
close the sale and download all the items at once. Alternatively, you can 
click the Buy (for an album) or Buy Song buttons for each item that you 
want to purchase.

You can see the list of all the items that you purchased by selecting the 
Purchased playlist under the iTunes Store option in the Source pane. The List

Changing your iTunes Store preferences
You can change your shopping method by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on 
the Mac or by choosing Edit➪Preferences in Windows. In the Preferences 
window, click the Store button. The Store Preferences window appears, as 
shown in Figure 4-12.

Figure 4-12: 
Set your 
iTunes Store 
prefer-
ences.
 
You can set the following features:
 
 Change from 1-Click to Shopping Cart or vice versa. 1-Click is the default.
 
 Automatically check for available downloads from the iTunes Store, 
such as downloads that were not completed and new episodes for a 
podcast subscription.
 
 Automatically download prepurchased content, such as a Season Pass of 
TV show episodes. As the episodes become available, iTunes automati-
cally downloads them.
 
 Automatically download missing album artwork from the iTunes Store 
for albums and songs you’ve imported from other sources (such as 
audio CDs).
 
If you use more than one computer to access your iTunes Store account, you 
can set the preferences for each computer differently and still use the same 
account. For example, your home computer might have a faster connection 
than your laptop on a remote connection, so you can set your iTunes prefer-
ences accordingly: The home computer could be set to 1-Click, and the laptop 
could be set to shopping cart.
Resuming interrupted downloads
All sales are final; you can’t return the digital merchandise. However, the 
download must be successful — you have to receive it all — before the 
iTunes Store charges you for the purchase. If for any reason the download is 
interrupted or fails to complete, your order remains active until you connect 
to the iTunes Store again.

77
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
iTunes remembers to continue the download when you return to iTunes and 
connect to the Internet. If, for some reason, the download doesn’t continue, 
choose Store➪Check for Available Downloads to continue the interrupted 
download. You can also use this command to check for any purchased music 
that hasn’t downloaded yet.
While downloading from the iTunes Store, you can select Downloads in the 
Store section of the Source pane, as shown in Figure 4-13, to see the prog-
ress of your downloads, and to pause and resume (or cancel) any particular 
download. You can also prioritize the order of downloading by dragging 
items into a different order.
 
For the impatient viewers, the iTunes Store lets you start watching a video or 
movie before it finishes downloading. Click Downloads in the Store section of 
the Source pane as you’re downloading and double-click the item to watch it. 
The download continues as you watch from the beginning.
 
If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your information, you also 
lose all your digital content — you have to purchase and download that con-
tent again. However, you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up your 
iTunes library. You can also burn your songs, including purchased songs, to 
an audio CD, as I describe in Chapter 12.
 
To learn more about backing up your iTunes library, visit this book’s compan-
ion Web site.

Redeeming gift certificates 
and prepaid cards
If you’re the fortunate recipient of an iTunes Store gift certificate, all you need 
to do is use iTunes to go to the iTunes Store and set up a new account — if you 
don’t already have one. Recipients of gift certificates can set up new accounts 
without having to provide a credit card number. As a recipient of a gift, you 
can simply click None for the credit card option and use the gift certificate as 
the sole payment method.
You can receive gift certificates on paper (delivered by snail mail) or by 
e-mail. You can also receive a prepaid card with a fixed balance. To redeem 
a certificate, go to the Quick Links panel on the right side of the iTunes 
Store home page and click the Redeem link to go to the Redeem page. In the 
Redeem Code section of the Redeem page, type the number printed on the 
certificate or supplied in the e-mail and click the Redeem button to credit 
your account. If you haven’t signed into your account yet or you have no 
account, iTunes displays the sign-in dialog; for information about setting up 
an account, see the “Setting Up an Account” section, earlier in this chapter.
If you use Apple’s Mail program or access your MobileMe (formerly .Mac) e-mail 
through the Safari Web browser, you can redeem a gift certificate that was sent 
by e-mail by clicking the Redeem Now button at the bottom of the e-mail mes-
sage. This button launches iTunes with the iTunes Store option selected in the 
Source pane and displays the Redeem page with the certificate’s number auto-
matically filled in. Click the Redeem button to credit your account.
 
The balance of your gift certificate (how much you have left to spend) appears 
right next to your account name in the iTunes Store window and is updated as 
you make purchases.
Renting Movies
First, the good news: You can rent movies from the iTunes Store and play 
them on your iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, iPhone, or Apple TV as 
well as your computer. Plus, the entire experience is quick and easy, and you 
can even rent HD movies from your couch without your computer, just with 
Apple TV.
The bad news? None really, except that like other video rental stores, you 
have to pay a rental fee and watch the movie right away. With iTunes rentals, 
you have up to 29 days to start viewing the movie and up to 24 hours after 
starting to view it (in the U.S.; other countries vary). You don’t have to return

 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
anything — expired content is automatically deleted. You need the newest 
version of iTunes and QuickTime (see Chapter 2), and make sure your iPod, 
iPhone, or Apple TV has the most recent software updates.
To rent a movie, browse the iTunes Store on your computer or Apple TV and 
look for movies with a Rent button. Once you select Rent, your movie begins 
to download immediately, and the countdown starts — you have 30 days to 
watch it or 24 hours after starting to watch it. (Viewing time limits vary by 
country.) 
Renting from your computer
The iTunes Store offers a video format for movie rentals from your computer 
that enables the video to play on a video-enabled iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. 
The video resolution is 640 x up to 480 pixels for the iPod or iPhone, and the 
video is encoded anamorphically to increase the quality of the movie picture. 
Apple TV offers rentals of movies in 720p and 1080i HD formats, and some 
movies also include Dolby Pro-Logic II Surround sound. 
When you rent a movie using iTunes on your computer, it shows up in the 
Movies section of your library. Once the movie is downloaded, you can watch 
it on your computer or transfer the rental to an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV by 
following these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer, and select the device 
in the Devices section of the Source pane of iTunes.
 
 If you have an Apple TV, iTunes detects it — see Chapter 7 for details on 
setting up your Apple TV.
 
2. Click the Movies tab (for iPod) or the Videos tab (for iPhone or 
Apple TV).
 
3. Select the movie, and then click Move.
You must be connected to the Internet to transfer a rented movie, and after 
you transfer it from your computer, iTunes removes it from your library. 
If you rented the movie using iTunes on your computer, you can move the 
movie between an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV as many times as you want 
during the rental period, but the movie can be played on only one device at 
a time.
If your rental doesn’t show up in iTunes, choose Store➪Check for Available 
Downloads. You can report problems with your movie rentals (such as acci-
dental rentals or quality problems) directly through your Purchase History in 
iTunes (see “Viewing your purchase history” later in this chapter).

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Renting directly on Apple TV
The iTunes Store offers the Widescreen Apple TV format, with a video resolu-
tion of 720 x up to 480 pixels (for movies you rent directly on Apple TV) and 
many movies are also available in high definition (HD) at 1,280 x up to 720 
pixels. The Widescreen format is encoded anamorphically to increase the qual-
ity of the movie picture. Apple TV rentals offer stereo sound or Dolby Digital 
Surround 5.1 sound, and some offer Dolby Pro-Logic II Surround sound.
Movies rented on your Apple TV aren’t transferable to any other device and 
can be viewed only on your Apple TV. (See Chapter 7 for instructions on how 
to use Apple TV menus.) To rent movies using your Apple TV, you must first 
use your handheld Apple Remote to navigate the Apple TV menus and sign 
into the online store:
 
1. From the main Apple TV menu, choose Settings➪General➪iTunes Store. 
 
 The iTunes Store menu appears on your Apple TV with the Location and 
Sign In/Out options. If your location and iTunes account already appear 
next to these options, skip to the next set of steps.
 
2. Choose the Location option and then scroll to highlight your country 
and select it. 
 
3. Press Menu once to return to the previous screen, and choose Sign in 
(this is Sign Out if you are already signed in).
 
4. Enter your Apple ID and password. 
 
 If you don’t have an Apple ID, create an account as described in “Setting 
Up an Account” in this chapter.
 
5. Apple TV gives you the option to remember your password. Select Yes 
if you want to save the password.
 
6. Press and hold the Menu button to return to the main Apple TV menu.
To rent movies on your Apple TV:
 
1. Select Movies from the main Apple TV menu.
 
2. Choose one of the following categories to find movies: Top Movies, 
Genres, All HD, or Search.
 
 You can search for movies with the Search option and your remote 
control.
 
3. Find a movie and press Play/Pause for more details.
 
4. Select Rent, or Rent HD for high definition movies.
 
 Rent HD may not be available for all movies, and movie rentals may not 
be available in all regions.
 
5. Click OK to confirm and continue.

81
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
Your movie downloads immediately into your Apple TV, and a message 
appears when the movie is ready watch. At this point, you can press Play to 
begin watching the movie, or press the Menu button to make other selections.
To see all the movies that you’ve rented, select Movies➪Rented Movies from 
the main Apple TV menu. The Rented Movies menu also shows when your 
rented movie is due to expire.
If your download is interrupted, go to Setting➪Downloads and select Check 
for Downloads. Apple TV will connect with the iTunes Store and will resume 
downloading.
Managing Your iTunes Store Account
Online stores record necessary information about you, such as your credit 
card number, your billing address, and so forth. You usually can change this 
information at any time, and the iTunes Store is no exception in this regard. 
You can also take advantage of special iTunes Store account features, such as 
sending gift certificates, setting parental controls, and setting up allowance 
accounts.
Viewing and changing 
account information
Life is unpredictable. As John Lennon sang in “Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),” 
“Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” So if 
your billing address changes, or you need to switch to another credit card, or 
you need to change your password for any reason, you can edit your account 
information at any time.
To see your account information in the iTunes Store, click the Account 
button that shows your account name, or click the Account link in the Quick 
Links panel of the iTunes Store home page. If you haven’t logged in recently, 
iTunes displays a dialog for you to enter your account password — enter the 
password and then click View Account.
Your account page displays fields for your Apple ID, the last four digits of the 
credit card that you use for the account, your billing address, your most recent 
purchase, and your computer authorizations. (See “Authorizing computers 
to play purchased music,” later in this chapter.) You can click buttons to edit 
your account and credit card information and also to manage alerts (e-mail 
messages sent by iTunes about new releases from artists that are listed in your 
purchase history). You can also manage your iMix playlists (see Chapter 10 for 
details on how to create and manage an iMix) and view your purchase history.

82
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Viewing your purchase history
In the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, you might recall songs from the 1960s but not 
remember what you bought last week. To view your purchase history, go to 
your account page by clicking the Account button (top-right corner), or by 
clicking the Account link in the Quick Links panel of the iTunes Store home 
page, and then type your password to log in to your account. Click the View 
Account button; on your account page, click the Purchase History button.
The iTunes Store displays the items that you purchased, starting with the 
most recent. If you bought a lot of content, not all of the items appear on the 
first page. To see the details of previous purchases, click the arrow to the left 
of the order date. After viewing your history, click Done at the bottom of the 
history page to return to your account page.
Setting up allowances
Do you trust your kids with your credit card? You don’t have to answer that, 
but you can sidestep the entire issue by gifting an allowance account that lets 
you set the amount of credit each month, from $10–$200 in increments of $10. 
You can change the amount of an allowance or stop it at any time. (And if 
these accounts are for kids, put your mind at rest by reading “Setting paren-
tal controls,” later in this chapter.)
 
To use an allowance account, the recipient must be using iTunes version 4 or 
newer and live in a country where the iTunes Store is available on the Internet 
(such as the United States).
You can set up the allowance account yourself or define an allowance on an 
existing account. The recipient signs in to the account and types his or her 
password — no credit card required. When the recipient reaches the limit of the 
allowance, that account can’t buy anything else until the following month. The 
iTunes Store saves any unused balance until the next iTunes Store purchase.
To set up an allowance account, click the Buy iTunes Gifts link in the Quick 
Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page. Scroll the result-
ing Buy iTunes Gifts page to the bottom to find the Allowances section and 
then click the Set Up Allowance Now link. iTunes takes you to the Allowance 
Setup page, where you can enter your name, your recipient’s name, and the 
monthly allowance amount (using the Monthly Allowance pop-up menu). You 
also enter your recipient’s Apple ID and password, or choose the option to 
set up a new account.
Click Continue to proceed with the account setup process, and then follow 
the instructions to finish setting up the account.

83
 Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store
To stop an allowance or change the amount of an allowance account, go to 
your account page by clicking the Account button (top-right corner), or click 
the Account link in the Quick Links panel of the iTunes Store home page, and 
then type your password to log into your account. Click the View Account 
button and scroll the account page until you see the Setup Allowance button; 
click this button to go to the Allowance page.
Sending gift certificates
A song is a gift that keeps on giving every time the recipient plays it. A gift of 
a music video or TV show might commemorate a special occasion. Besides, 
you can’t go wrong giving an iTunes Store gift certificate to that special 
person who has everything. You can send a certificate as an e-mail message 
or print the certificate yourself on your own printer.
Before sending a gift certificate for some tunes, first make sure that the recip-
ient can run iTunes 4 or newer versions. Also, he or she must be able to run 
iTunes 6 or newer versions for video. (You might want to subtly suggest to 
the future recipient in an e-mail that it’s time to download the newest version 
of iTunes, just to find out whether he or she has the requisite system configu-
ration; see Chapter 2.)
To buy a gift certificate to send to someone, click the Buy iTunes Gifts link in 
the Quick Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page. Scroll 
the resulting Buy iTunes Gifts page to the Printable Gift Certificates or Email 
Gift Certificates sections. Click the Buy Now link in either section to start 
the process of buying a gift certificate. Follow the instructions to enter your 
name, the recipient’s name, the recipient’s e-mail or snail mail address (for 
printed certificates), the amount of the gift, and a personal message.
Setting parental controls
Art may imitate life, but sometimes you might not want life to imitate art — 
or in this case, your kids’ lives to be exposed to entertainment you deem 
inappropriate. iTunes not only provides a Parental Advisory Label next to 
explicit items in the online store, but also lets you restrict explicit content 
from displaying in the iTunes Store. You can also disable podcasts, radio 
content, the iTunes Store itself, and shared music so that these items don’t 
appear in the Source pane.
To set parental controls, choose iTunes➪Preferences on the Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences in Windows. In the Preferences window that appears, click 
the Parental tab to see the Parental Control preferences.

84
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
You can click options to disable podcasts, radio stations, the iTunes Store, 
and shared libraries. When it’s disabled, the content source (podcasts, radio 
stations, iTunes Store, or shared libraries) doesn’t appear in the iTunes 
Source pane and can’t be selected. To restrict content itself, you can choose 
a rating system for a specific country in the Ratings For pop-up menu, and 
then click options to restrict movies, TV shows, and games using the chosen 
country’s rating levels available in pop-up menus. You can also click the 
option to restrict all explicit content.
After selecting options, click the Lock icon to prevent further changes. 
iTunes displays a dialog requiring you to type the administrator password for 
your computer system. Click OK after typing the password, and then click OK 
again to close iTunes preferences so that the changes take effect.
To make changes later, click the Lock icon to unlock the preferences, and 
type the administrator password again. And, of course, don’t tell your kids 
the administration password.
Authorizing computers to play 
purchased music
The computer that you use to set up your account is automatically authorized 
by Apple to play the content you buy from the iTunes Store. Fortunately, the 
content isn’t locked to that computer. You can copy your purchased songs, 
audio books, podcasts, and videos to other computers and play them with 
iTunes. When you first play them on the other computers, iTunes asks for your 
iTunes Store account ID and password to authorize that computer. You can 
have up to five computers authorized at any one time. You can also authorize a 
computer at any time by choosing Store➪Authorize Computer.
 
Purchased songs, audio books, and videos need to be downloaded or copied 
to one of your authorized computers before you can copy them from the 
added computer to an iPod using iTunes.
If you want to delete one computer and add another computer, you can 
remove the authorization from a computer by choosing Store➪Deauthorize 
Computer on that computer. If the computer no longer works and you there-
fore can’t deauthorize it, you can contact Apple through its iTunes Store sup-
port page (www.apple.com/support/itunes/store/authorization).
 
Remember to deauthorize your computer before you sell it or give it away. 
Also, deauthorize your computer before upgrading your RAM, hard drive, or 
other system components. Otherwise, the upgraded system might count as an 
authorized computer. If you’ve reached five authorizations, you can reset your 
authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All on the Account Information 

85

screen. You can do this only once per year. The Deauthorize All button 
appears only if you have five authorized computers and you haven’t used the 
option in the last 12 months.
Accessing the Store from Your 
iPod touch or iPhone
The music section of iTunes Store content is available right at your fingertips 
if you have an iPod touch or iPhone. You can search for, browse, preview, 
purchase, and download songs and albums directly to iPod touch or iPhone. 
Whatever you buy on your iPod touch or iPhone is automatically copied to your 
iTunes library the next time you synchronize the device with your computer. 
To use the iTunes Store on an iPod touch, join a Wi-Fi network that is con-
nected to the Internet (see Chapter 15 for details). You can use the 3G net-
work or Wi-Fi on an iPhone. Be sure you have an iTunes Store account set up 
(see “Setting Up an Account” in this chapter). 
Browsing and previewing songs
To go to the iTunes Store on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose iTunes from 
the Home menu. The store screen appears with Featured, Top Tens, Search, 
and Downloads buttons along the bottom. Touch any song to hear a preview.
Touch Featured to see featured items, new releases, and store recommenda-
tions. The screen displays New Releases, What’s Hot, and Genres buttons 
along the top. To search through genres, touch Genres and choose a genre. 
Touch Top Tens to see a list of the top ten choices in different genres. 
Choose iTunes in the Top Tens list to see the top ten songs in all of iTunes.
Touch Search to search the store, and touch the entry field to bring up the 
on-screen keyboard (for details on how to use the on-screen keyboard, see 
Chapter 1). Type the search term and touch Search to search the store. 
Touch Downloads to see the progress of your downloads from the store, or 
to redeem gift certificates — by touching the Redeem button.
 
If you happen to be in one of the select U.S. Starbucks locations that plays 
iTunes music, the Starbucks icon appears at the bottom of the screen next to 
Featured. Tap the Starbucks icon to find out what song is playing at that very 
moment in the Starbucks. You can also browse featured Starbucks Collections.

Purchasing songs
To purchase songs on iPod touch or iPhone, you must have been signed in 
to your iTunes Store account in iTunes when you last synchronized it; if not, 
use iTunes to sign into the iTunes Store by clicking the Account button and 
typing your password; then synchronize your iPod touch or iPhone. All pur-
chases you make with your are charged to your iTunes Store account.
To buy a song, touch the price, and then touch Buy Now. Enter your pass-
word and tap OK. 
Purchased songs are added to a Purchased playlist on your iPod touch or 
iPhone, and they’re included in your Purchased playlist in iTunes as well as 
in a special Purchased on “your device name” playlist. iTunes automatically 
syncs songs and albums purchased on your iPod touch or iPhone to your 
iTunes library when you connect iPod touch to your computer, so that you 
have a backup if you delete purchases from the iPod touch or iPhone. 
Some albums offer bonus content, such as liner notes, which are downloaded 
to your iTunes library on your computer, but not to your iPod touch or 
iPhone. An alert appears if you’ve previously purchased one or more songs 
from an album. Touch Buy if you want to purchase the entire album, or touch 
Cancel if you want to buy the remaining songs on the album individually.
To see the status of the downloading, touch Downloads in the lower-right 
corner of the iTunes Store screen. You can pause a download by touching the 
Pause icon. 
 
If you lose your network connection or turn off your iPod touch or iPhone 
while downloading, the download pauses and then resumes when you rees-
tablish an Internet connection. If you go back to your computer, iTunes can 
complete the download operation to your iTunes library.
To make sure you received all your downloads from purchases on your iPod 
touch or iPhone, use iTunes on your computer and choose Store➪Check for 
Available Downloads.

Bringing Content into iTunes
In This Chapter
 Setting your music importing preferences
 Ripping music from CDs and adding music files
 Adding audio books to your library
 Subscribing to podcasts on Web sites
 Adding video files to your library
S
everal excellent reasons to bring your music CDs into iTunes, or to 
download media files from the iTunes Store into iTunes, are
 
 To preserve the content forever, in digital format
 
 To play the content easily from your computer (without having to 
fumble with discs)
 
 To play the content with Apple TV
 
 To take the content in your iPod or iPhone with you
In this chapter, I show you how to store content in your iTunes library. A 
song or video in digital format can be kept in that format in a file on any 
number of digital media storage devices. Even if your CDs, DVDs, and hard 
drive fail, your backup copy (assuming that you made a backup copy on a 
safety CD or hard drive) is still as perfect as the original digital file. You may 
make any number of digital copies with no technical limitations on playing 
the copies except those imposed by the iTunes Store for content that you 
purchase.
 
While you add more content, your iTunes library becomes your entertainment 
center. With it, you can find any item you want to play faster than you can 
open a CD jewel case, as I show in Chapter 8. Your iTunes library also man-
ages your content and makes it easy to transfer some, or all of it, to your iPod 
or iPhone (as I describe in Chapter 11).

88
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Adding Music
Bringing music tracks from a CD into iTunes is ripping a CD. I’m not sure why 
it’s called that, but Apple certainly took the term to a new level with an ad 
campaign for Macs that featured the slogan Rip, Mix, Burn. Burning a mix CD 
was the hip thing to do a few years ago. With iTunes, you can still rip and 
mix, but if you have an iPod, you may no longer need to burn CDs to play 
your music wherever you go — just take your iPod.
Ripping, in technical terms, is extracting the song’s digital information from 
an audio CD. In common terms, ripping includes compressing the song’s 
digital information and encoding it in a particular sound file format. How easy 
is it to rip a CD? Pop an audio CD into your CD-ROM/DVD drive, and unless 
you’ve changed your preferences (as described in the following section), 
you’ll see the message in Figure 5-1. Click Yes to rip your CD into iTunes 
without further ado, or click No to set your ripping preferences and import 
settings first.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Click Yes to 
rip your CD 
into iTunes 
automati-
cally, or No 
to set pref-
erences first 
or edit song 
information 
first.
 
You might want to change import settings to improve sound quality or to 
reduce the amount of disk space occupied by songs. The import settings 
affect sound quality, hard drive space on both the computer and the iPod or 
iPhone, and compatibility with other types of players and computers. 
 
To find out more about import settings and how they reduce space or 
increase audio quality, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
You may also want to edit song information first, as I describe in Chapter 9. 
In either case, you can click No to stop the import operation and make your 
changes first.

89
 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
Changing import preferences and settings
Although importing music from an audio CD takes a lot less time than playing 
the CD, it still takes time. To minimize that time, you want your import prefer-
ences and settings to be correct before starting. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences-->General on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪
General in Windows.
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog opens showing the General preferences, 
including the When You Insert a CD pop-up menu, and the Import Settings 
button.
 
2. Choose what action iTunes should take for the When You Insert a CD 
option in the General preferences. 
 
 Choose one of the following actions in the pop-up menu for when you 
insert an audio CD, as shown in Figure 5-2:
 
• Show CD: iTunes does nothing else. This setting is ideal if you regu-
larly edit the song information first, as I describe in Chapter 9.
 
• Begin Playing: See Chapter 3 for details on playing CDs.
 
• Ask to Import CD: iTunes displays a dialog asking whether you want 
to import the CD (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
• Import CD: iTunes uses the current import settings and automati-
cally imports the CD. Don’t use this setting unless you’re sure that 
the import settings are already set to your liking.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Set the 
appropri-
ate action 
for iTunes 
after a CD is 
inserted.
 

90
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
• Import CD and Eject: iTunes automatically imports and then ejects 
the CD, making way for the next one. This option is useful for 
importing a batch of CDs. Don’t use this setting unless you’re sure 
that the import settings are already set to your liking.
 
3. Turn on the Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet 
option.
 
 This option is turned on by default, but make sure it’s on by selecting 
it so that a check mark appears. iTunes automatically grabs the song 
titles, artist names, album titles, and so forth directly from the Internet 
database of songs, as I describe in Chapter 9. 
 
4. Click the Import Settings button in the General preferences.
 
 The Import Settings dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Change 
your import 
settings for 
ripping CDs.
 
The Import Settings dialog offers the following choices:
 
 Import Using: Set this pop-up menu to choose the import encoder. This 
choice is perhaps the most important, and I describe it in more detail 
later in this section.
 
 Setting: This offers different settings depending on your choice of 
encoder. For example, in Figure 5-4, the AAC Encoder is already selected, 
and I’m in the process of choosing Higher Quality. Set this pop-up menu 
to High Quality or better for most music. 
 
 Use Error Correction When Reading Audio CDs: Although you’ll reduce 
importing speed, select this check box to use error correction if you 
have problems with audio quality or if the CD skips. (Not every skipping 
CD can be imported even with error correction, but it might help.)

91
 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
 
Figure 5-4: 
Change the 
quality set-
ting for the 
encoder you 
chose for 
importing.
 
For a quick and pain-free ripping session, choose from among the following 
encoders in the Import Using pop-up menu based on how you plan to use the 
music:
 
 AAC Encoder: I recommend AAC for almost all music. (However, AIFF, 
Apple Lossless, or WAV is better if you plan to burn another audio CD at 
the highest quality with the songs you ripped.) Choose the High Quality 
option from the Setting pop-up menu.
 
 You can always convert a song that you’ve already ripped in AIFF, 
Apple Lossless, or WAV to AAC or MP3. However, ripping a CD with one 
encoder might be more convenient. After that, you can rip it again with 
a different encoder. For example, you might import Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club Band with the AAC encoder for use in your Mac and iPod. 
You might then import it again with the higher-quality Apple Lossless or 
AIFF encoder under a different name (such as Sgt. Pepper-2), for burning 
onto an audio CD. After burning the CD, you can delete Sgt. Pepper-2 to 
reclaim the hard drive space.
 
 AIFF Encoder: Use AIFF if you plan to burn the song to an audio CD 
using a Mac (use WAV for Windows), or use it with a DVD project. 
AIFF offers the highest possible quality, but it takes up a lot of space 
(about 10MB per minute). Choose the Automatic option from the Setting 
pop-up menu for best results. Don’t use AIFF format for songs that you 
intend to transfer to your iPod or to an MP3 CD; convert them first to 
AAC or MP3.
 
 Apple Lossless Encoder: Use the Apple Lossless encoder for songs that 
you intend to burn onto audio CDs as well as for playing on iPods. The 
files are just small enough (about 60–70 percent of the size of the AIFF 
versions) that they don’t hiccup on playback.

92
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
 MP3 Encoder: Use the MP3 format for songs that you intend to burn on 
MP3 CDs or that you intend to use with MP3 players or your iPod — it’s 
universally supported. If you use MP3, I recommend choosing the Higher 
Quality option from the Setting pop-up menu.
 
 WAV Encoder: WAV is the high-quality sound format that’s used on PCs 
(like AIFF), but it also takes up a lot of space (about 10MB per minute). 
Use WAV if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD or using WAV 
with PCs. Choose the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu 
for best results. Don’t use WAV for songs that you intend to transfer to 
your iPod or to an MP3 CD; use MP3 instead. 
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, how to adjust custom settings 
to reduce space and increase audio quality, and how to convert songs from 
one format to another (and what problems to look out for when doing so), 
visit this book’s companion Web site. 
Don’t fall into the gaps
Some CDs — particularly live concert albums, classical albums, rock operas 
(such as The Who’s Tommy), and theme albums (such as Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club Band by The Beatles) — are meant to be played straight through, 
with no fading between the songs. Although you can cross-fade between 
songs automatically in iTunes, you can’t on your iPod or iPhone.
Fortunately, you can turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs 
or for an entire album. With the Gapless Album option set in iTunes, songs 
play seamlessly one to the next. You can also play these songs seamlessly 
on fifth-generation iPods (and second-generation iPod nanos) that have the 
latest software update, as well as on current iPod and iPhone models.
To turn on the Gapless Album option for an entire CD before importing it, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click No if the import dialog appears (to postpone importing).
 
2. Select the CD title in the Source pane.
 
 The CD title appears in the Source pane under Devices. 
 
3. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The CD Info dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
4. Select the check box next to the Gapless Album option and then 
click OK.

To turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs on the CD but not 
the entire CD, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding list.
 
2. Select the songs in the list pane.
 
 From the album, select the songs that you want to play continuously 
(such as the first two songs of Sgt. Pepper).
 
 To select multiple songs, click the first one, press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in 
Windows, and click each subsequent song. To select consecutive songs, 
click the first one, hold down the Shift key, and click the last one.
 
3. Choose File➪Get Info and then click Yes in the warning dialog about 
editing multiple items.
 
 The Multiple Item Information dialog opens.
 
4. Click the Options tab to see the Options dialog, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
5. Select Yes for the Gapless Album option pop-up menu. 
 
 After choosing Yes in the pop-up menu, a check mark appears next to 
the Gapless Album option to indicate that it has changed.
 
6. Click OK to close the Multiple Item Information dialog and update the 
options for the selected songs.
What happens if you turn on Crossfade Playback for playing songs in iTunes, 
as I describe in Chapter 6, but you don’t want to cross-fade between spe-
cific songs on an album that has no gaps? You don’t have to keep turning 
Crossfade Playback on and off: Simply deselect the Gapless Album option for 
those songs.
 
For older iPod models, or as an alternative to using the Gapless Album option, 
you can use the Join Tracks option when ripping a CD to join the tracks in 
your iTunes library so that they play seamlessly on an iPod. To join tracks, 
select the tracks and choose Advanced➪Join CD Tracks. You can join tracks 
only when ripping a CD, not afterward.

Ripping music from CDs
After checking your import settings and preferences, you’re ready to rip. To 
rip a CD, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert an audio CD into your computer.
 
 The songs appear in the List pane as generic, unnamed tracks at first. 
If your computer is connected to the Internet, if you’ve turned on the 
option to automatically retrieve song information from the Internet, and 
if the CD is in the Gracenote CDDB database (described in Chapter 9), 
iTunes automatically retrieves the track information. 
 
 A dialog appears asking if you want to import the CD, with Yes and No 
buttons.
 
2. Click Yes to import (and skip to Step 5), or No to set options first.
 
 Click No to set preferences and import settings as described in the 
previous section; or to set songs to be skipped; or if you see unnamed 
tracks rather than the proper track, artist, and album names.
 
 If the first attempt at retrieving song information doesn’t work and 
you see unnamed tracks, check your connection to the Internet first. If 
everything is fine with your connection, stop the importing operation 
and then choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names to try again to get the 
track information. If you don’t want to connect to the Internet or if your 
CD isn’t recognized by the Gracenote database, you can type the track 
information yourself (see Chapter 9).
 
3. (Optional) Deselect the check boxes next to any songs on the CD that 
you don’t want to import.

95
 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
 
 iTunes imports only the songs that have check marks next to them; 
when you remove the check mark next to a song, iTunes skips that song.
 
 Be sure to set your import settings and the Gapless Album option to 
your liking before actually ripping the CD.
 
4. Click the Import CD button.
 
 The Import CD button appears at the bottom-right corner of the iTunes 
window after you insert a CD. The status display shows the progress of 
the operation. To cancel, click the small x next to the progress bar in the 
status display.
 
 iTunes displays an orange, animated waveform icon next to the song 
that it’s importing. When iTunes finishes importing each song, it 
replaces the waveform icon with a check mark, as shown in Figure 5-7. 
(On a color monitor, the check mark is green.) iTunes chimes when it 
finishes the import list.
 
5. When all the songs are imported, eject the CD by clicking the Eject 
button next to the disc name in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 You can also choose Controls➪Eject Disc to eject the disc. Mac users can 
press the Eject button on the upper-right corner of the Mac keyboard.
Adding music files
You can download a music file or copy it from another computer to your 
hard drive. After you save or copy an MP3 file — or, for that matter, an AIFF 
or WAV file — on your hard drive, you can simply drag it into the iTunes 
window to bring it into your library. If you drag a folder or disk icon, all 
the audio files that it contains are added to your iTunes library. You can 
also choose File➪Add to Library on a Mac, or File➪Add File to Library and 
File➪Add Folder to Library on a Windows PC, as an alternative to dragging.
 
Figure 5-7: 
iTunes 
shows a

96
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
When you add a song to your iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the 
iTunes Music folder; that is, as long as you have your iTunes preferences 
set for Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to Library. (This is 
the default setting, which you can find in the Advanced tab of the iTunes 
Preferences dialog.) See Chapter 12 for details on storing music in your iTunes 
Music folder.
If you have song files in another folder or on another hard drive, and you 
want to add them to the iTunes library without copying the files to the 
iTunes Music folder, you can copy a link to the original files without copying 
the files. To copy only links to song files and not copy the actual files when 
you add songs, you can turn off the default copy files option by doing the 
following:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
2. Click the Advanced tab in the iTunes Preferences dialog.
 
3. Turn off the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to 
Library setting.
You can check out the contents of your music folder by using the Finder 
on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a Windows PC, as I describe in detail in 
Chapter 12. 
When you bring a song file into iTunes, the song is copied into a new file in 
the iTunes library without changing or deleting the original file. You can then 
convert the song to another format. For example, you can convert an AIFF file 
to an MP3 file while leaving the original intact. 
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats and how to convert songs 
from one format to another (and what problems to look out for when doing 
so), visit this book’s companion Web site. You can also find out how to bring 
any sound into iTunes, even music from scratchy vinyl records or sound 
effects recorded through a microphone. 
 
MP3 CDs are easy to add because they’re essentially data CDs. Simply insert 
them into your CD-ROM drive, open the CD in the Finder, and drag and drop 
the MP3 song files into the iTunes window. Downloaded song files are even 
easier — just drag and drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a folder or CD 
icon, all the audio files it contains are added to your iTunes library.
Adding Audio Books
Do you like to listen to audio books and spoken magazine and newspaper 
articles? Not only can you bring these files into iTunes, but you can also 
transfer them to an iPod or iPhone and take them on the road, which is much 
more convenient than taking cassettes or CDs.

97
 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
Audible is a leading provider of downloadable, spoken audio files. Audible lets 
you authorize computers to play the audio files — just like the iTunes Store; 
see Chapter 4. Audible does require that you purchase the files, and content 
from Audible is also licensed by Apple to be included in the iTunes Store. 
Audible content includes magazines and radio programs as well as books.
To import Audible files, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.audible.com.
 
 Set up an account if you don’t already have one.
 
2. Select and download an Audible audio file.
 
 Files that end with .aa are Audible files.
 
3. Drag the Audible file to the iTunes window.
 
 If this is the first time that you’ve added an Audible file, iTunes asks for 
your Audible account information. You enter this information once for 
each computer that you use with your Audible account.
To disable an Audible account, open iTunes on the computer that you no 
longer want to use with the account, and choose Advanced➪Deauthorize 
Audible Account. In the Deauthorize Audible Account dialog that appears, 
enter the username and password for the account, and then click OK.
 
You need to be online to authorize a computer or to remove the authorization 
from that computer.
Adding Podcasts
You can add podcasts to your iTunes library by subscribing to them in the 
iTunes Store (as I describe in breathtaking detail in Chapter 4) or by sub-
scribing to them directly from Web sites that host them. Similar to a tape of 
a radio broadcast, you can save and play a podcast at your convenience — 
both in iTunes on your computer and on your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV.
 
A podcast can be anything from a single song or video to a radio or TV show. 
Audio podcasts are saved in the MP3 format and may be used with any media 
player, device, or application that supports MP3, including your iPod. Video 
podcasts are saved in the QuickTime (.mov) format or the Moving Pictures 
Expert Group (MPEG-4) formats, including the standard .mp4 format and the 
Apple TV .m4v format, which can be used with iPods that play video, the 
iPhone, Apple TV, and many other video players.
The podcast producer uses Really Simple Syndication (RSS) technology — 
the same technology used to distribute blogs and news feeds across the 
Internet — to publish the podcast. RSS feeds are typically linked to an RSS 

98
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
or an eXtensible Markup Language (XML; the language of RSS) button. With 
a feed reader, aggregator application, or browser plug-in, you can automati-
cally check RSS-enabled Web pages and display updated stories and pod-
casts. RSS version 2, the most popular version for podcasting, is supported 
directly by some Web browsers, including Apple’s Safari for Mac OS X and 
Windows.
With iTunes, you can play a podcast, incorporate it into playlists, make 
copies, and burn it onto CD as much as you like. If you don’t like the podcast, 
simply delete it from your iTunes library and update your iPod to delete it 
from your iPod.
Subscribing to podcasts
The Podcasts section of the iTunes Store offers access to many thousands 
of podcasts, but more than a million podcasts exist, many of which are avail-
able only on their Web sites. The iTunes Store makes it easy to subscribe to 
podcasts, so check there first — turn to Chapter 4 to see how to subscribe to 
podcasts in the iTunes Store.
By subscribing, I mean simply listing the podcast in your iTunes Podcasts 
pane so that new episodes are downloaded automatically. It’s like a magazine 
subscription that’s updated with a new issue every month or so. You don’t 
have to register or fill out any form. You don’t have to provide an e-mail 
address or any other information. Your copy of iTunes automatically finds 
new podcast episodes and downloads them to your computer.
The easiest way to subscribe to a podcast is through the iTunes Store. 
However, if you can’t find a podcast in the store and you know how to find its 
Web site, open your browser and then go to that Web site. Some Web sites 
also offer an iTunes button to click to go directly to the iTunes Store to sub-
scribe to the podcast.
If there is no iTunes button, you can still subscribe to a podcast directly from 
iTunes by grabbing information from its Web site first. Follow these steps:
 
1. In your browser, Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the pod-
cast’s RSS2 link on the Web page.
 
 Look for the RSS version 2 link on the Web page. Many sites use an icon, 
as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
2. Copy the podcast’s RSS2 link.
 
• Safari: Choose Copy Link.
 
• Firefox or Internet Explorer: Choose Copy Link Location.

 You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast listing margin, as shown 
in Figure 5-10, to display separate information about the podcast’s 
newest episode.
 
6. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
 
 You can now play the podcast just like a song or video in your iTunes 
library. You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward, 
rewind, or play the podcast from any point. The blue dot next to a pod-
cast means you haven’t played it yet. As soon as you start listening to 
or watching a podcast, the dot disappears. You can even drag podcast 
episodes into a playlist, as I describe in Chapter 10, and then burn that 
playlist onto a CD, as I describe in Chapter 12.
 
Podcasts don’t show up in Party Shuffle unless you drag them into the Party 
Shuffle playlist; see Chapter 6.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link 
to a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork 
pane.

 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
Updating podcasts
Many podcast feeds provide new material on a regular schedule. iTunes can 
check these feeds automatically and update your library with new podcast 
episodes. You can, for example, schedule iTunes to check for new podcast 
episodes — such as news, weather, traffic reports, and morning talk shows — 
before you wake up and automatically update your iPod or iPhone. When you 
get up, you have new podcast episodes to listen to in your iPod or iPhone.
To check for updates manually, select Podcasts in the Library section of the 
Source pane and then click the Refresh button in the lower-right corner of the 
Podcasts pane, which appears if podcasts need to be updated. All subscribed 
podcast feeds are updated immediately when you click Refresh, and iTunes 
downloads the most recent (or all) episodes, depending on how you set your 
podcasts preferences to schedule podcast updates.
Scheduling podcast updates
To change your podcast settings so iTunes can check for new podcasts auto-
matically, click Settings at the bottom of the Podcasts pane to display the 
Podcast Settings dialog, as shown in Figure 5-11.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Set iTunes 
to auto-
matically 
check for, 
download, 
and keep 
podcast 
episodes.
 
You can change the settings for each podcast separately by choosing the 
podcast in the Settings For pop-up menu. You can also set the default set-
tings for all podcasts by choosing Default in the Settings For pop-up menu. 
The settings are:
 
 Check for New Episodes: Choose to check for podcasts every hour, day, 
week, or manually — whenever you want.

102
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
 When New Episodes Are Available: You can download the most recent 
one (useful for news podcasts), download all episodes (useful for 
podcasts you might want to keep), or nothing so that you can use the 
Refresh button to update manually as you need.
 
 Episodes to Keep: Choose to keep all episodes, all unplayed episodes, 
the most recent episodes, or previous episodes (refer to Figure 5-11).
 
 Keeping unplayed episodes is a useful way to organize your news pod-
casts. If you’ve played an episode (or a portion of it), you likely don’t 
need it anymore, but you probably do want to keep the ones you haven’t 
played yet. Set iTunes to automatically delete podcast episodes that you 
don’t want to keep.
 
 If you copy podcasts automatically when synchronizing your iPod or 
iPhone, as I describe in Chapter 11, don’t set the Episodes to Keep 
pop-up to All Unplayed Episodes. This is why: If you listen to part of a 
podcast episode on your iPod or iPhone and then synchronize your iPod 
or iPhone, the podcast episode disappears from iTunes (because it is no 
longer unplayed). But don’t worry; the episodes are still out there on the 
Internet. You can always recover them by choosing Download All for the 
When New Episodes Are Available option. 
Adding Videos
Besides purchasing and downloading videos from the iTunes Store, as I 
describe in nearly orgasmic detail in Chapter 4, you can also download 
videos from the Internet or copy them from other computers and bring them 
into iTunes. You can then watch QuickTime and MPEG-4 movies (files that 
end in .mov, .m4v, or .mp4) in iTunes.
You can also use them in a video-enabled iPod or iPhone and with Apple TV. 
iTunes provides options for converting videos in the iTunes library into a 
format that looks better when you play them on an iPod or iPhone display, 
or into a format that looks better on televisions connected to Apple TV. To 
convert a video for use with an iPod or iPhone, select the video (see Chapter 
8 for browsing instructions), and choose Advanced➪Create iPod or iPhone 
Version. To convert a video for use with Apple TV, choose Advanced➪Create 
Apple TV Version. The selected videos are automatically copied when you 
convert them, leaving the originals intact.
 
To find out more about converting videos in iTunes for use with iPods, 
iPhones, and Apple TV, visit this book’s companion Web site. 

103
 Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes
QuickTime, the Apple digital video file format, is installed on every Mac. It’s 
also downloaded and installed onto PCs along with the Windows version of 
iTunes. QuickTime is used extensively in the digital video production world 
for making videos for the Web. Music videos, movie trailers, and other videos 
you can buy on the iTunes Store are in the QuickTime format. MPEG-4 is a 
standard format for digital video that works on just about any computer that 
plays video.
You can drag the video into iTunes just like a song file. Drag each video file 
from the Mac Finder or Windows Desktop to the library, directly to a playlist 
in the iTunes Source pane or to the list or artwork view on the right side of 
the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 5-12.
The video files that you drag into iTunes, along with the movies, TV shows, 
and music videos you purchase from the iTunes Store, display in the Movies 
section of your iTunes library. Click Movies in the Library section of the 
Source pane to peek inside the Movies section (refer to Figure 5-12).
Video files are organized in folders and stored in the music library on your 
hard drive just like song files. You can find the video file’s location on your 
hard drive and its type by selecting the video and choosing File➪Get Info.
You can create your own QuickTime or MPEG-4 video files with a suitable 
video-editing application, such as iMovie for the Mac (part of the iLife soft-
ware suite that includes iTunes), or Apple QuickTime Pro for Windows, avail-
able from the Apple Store.

I
f you like to entertain folks by spinning tunes and playing videos at home 
or at parties, iTunes could easily become your media jockey console. 
Imagine how much music you could have at your fingertips with an iTunes 
library that can grow as large as your hard drive. You can fit more than 
20,000 songs, or 64 days of nonstop music, in about 100GB of hard drive 
space. When I last checked the Apple store, you could buy a 2 terabyte (TB) 
external drive for either Mac or PC that would probably hold enough music 
to run a radio station. But that’s not all: You can also manage your videos 
and favorite TV shows and play them in full-screen mode on your computer 
running iTunes.
Your computer is already a mean multimedia machine, with the capability to 
mix sounds, photos, and videos. You can play music through your computer’s 
built-in speakers or through headphones, but you’ll get better results with 
high-quality external speakers. You can even connect your home computer to 
an excellent stereo for high-quality sound. The same is true for video: You can 
use iTunes to play video on your computer’s display, or you can send it to a 
larger television or display monitor — even a video projector — to get a bigger 
picture.
And if you’ve integrated Apple TV with your home stereo and television, you 
can use iTunes to feed music to Apple TV, which has its own hard drive, as I 
describe in this chapter. See Chapter 7 for details on setting up Apple TV.

106
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Changing the Computer’s Output Volume
You can control the volume and other characteristics of the sound coming 
from your computer’s speakers, headphones, or external speakers. Even if 
you connect your computer to a stereo amplifier with its own volume and 
equalizer controls, it’s best to get the volume correct at the source — your 
computer and iTunes — and then adjust the output volume as you please on 
your stereo or external speaker unit.
You control the volume by using your computer system’s audio controls. 
iTunes also controls the volume, but that control is within the limits of the 
computer’s volume setting. For example, if you set your computer’s volume to 
half and set iTunes volume to full, you get half volume because the computer 
limits the volume to half. If you set your computer volume at half and also 
reduce the iTunes volume to half, you actually get one-quarter volume — half 
the computer’s setting. After the sound leaves your computer, you can adjust it 
further with the volume controls of your stereo system or external speakers.
The appropriate volume depends entirely on your preferences for hearing 
music, audio books, or video soundtracks. In general, though, the maximum 
level of output from your computer is preferable when connecting to a stereo 
system or speakers with volume controls. After setting your computer to the 
maximum volume, adjust the iTunes volume or your stereo or speaker volume 
(or both) to get the best sound. When using the computer’s speakers or 
headphones, the computer’s volume and the iTunes volume are the only 
volume controls that you have, so after adjusting the volume on your computer 
to the maximum level (or lower if you prefer), adjust the iTunes volume.
Adjusting the sound on a Mac
The Mac was built for sound from the very start. Making and playing music 
has been part of the Mac culture since the day that Steve Jobs introduced 
an audience to the original Mac with sound coming from its small speaker. 
(It played synthesized speech and simple tones, but it was the first personal 
computer with built-in sound.)
Current Apple Mac computers come with built-in or external speakers and at 
least one headphone/line-out connection that you can use to connect exter-
nal speakers or a stereo system. Mac OS X lets you configure output speakers 
and control levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
 
If you use external speakers, headphones, or a stereo system, make sure that 
you connect these devices properly before adjusting the volume.
To adjust the volume on your Mac, follow these steps:

107
 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock and 
then click the Sound icon.
 
 Otherwise, press Option and a volume control key on your keyboard 
simultaneously as a shortcut. You can have iTunes open and playing 
music while you do this.
 
2. In the Sound preferences window that opens, click Output and select 
the sound output device.
 
 If you have headphones or external speakers attached to the head-
phones connection on your Mac, a Headphones option appears in the 
list of sound output devices, as shown in Figure 6-1; if not, an External 
Speakers or Internal Speakers option appears for speakers connected 
through a line-out connection or built into the Mac.
 
3. Adjust the volume.
 
 You can do any of the following:
 
• Drag the slider to adjust the volume while you listen to music.
 
• Select the Mute check box to silence your Mac.
 
• Drag the Balance slider to put more music in the left or right channels.
 
4. Close the Preferences window, either by choosing System 
Preferences➪Quit System Preferences, clicking the red button in the 
upper-left corner of the window, or pressing Ô-Q.
 
 The Sound preferences window isn’t like a dialog: When you change settings, 
you can hear the effect immediately without having to click OK. (There 
isn’t an OK button, anyway.)

 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
Using AirTunes or Apple TV for 
Wireless Stereo Playback
You want to play the music in your iTunes library, but your stereo system is 
across the room or in another room, and you don’t want to extend wires to the 
stereo system. What you need is a wireless connection from your computer to 
your stereo system.
You can use an Apple AirPort Wi-Fi network in your home — such as AirPort 
Express by itself, or Apple TV with AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule. AirPort 
Express and Apple TV work with Apple’s AirTunes technology, which lets 
you play your iTunes music through your stereo or powered speakers in any 
room of your house, without wires. The only catch is that your computer 
must be within range of the Wi-Fi network or connected by an Ethernet cable.
Apple’s AirPort technology provides Wi-Fi networking for any AirPort-
equipped Mac or wireless-capable PC that uses a Wi-Fi–certified IEEE 802.11b, 
802.11g, or 802.11n wireless card or offers built-in Wi-Fi. For more about 
AirPort, see Mac OS X Leopard All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by 
Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
If you already have a wireless network in place, you can add AirPort Express 
without changing anything. The AirPort Express wirelessly links to your existing 
wireless network without requiring any change to the network. You can even use 
several AirPort Express units — one for each stereo system or set of powered 
speakers, in different rooms.
All by itself, AirPort Express creates a Wi-Fi network. You can attach your 
Internet cable modem or other Ethernet network to AirPort Express to link 
your ready-made Wi-Fi network to the outside world. You can also take AirPort 
Express on the road to use in hotel rooms to share an Internet connection 
among wireless computers.
To use AirTunes and AirPort Express, follow these steps:
 
1. Install the software supplied with AirPort Express.
 
 The CD-ROM includes support for AirTunes.
 
2. Connect your stereo or a set of powered speakers to the AirPort 
Express audio port.
 
 You can use an optical digital or analog audio cable. (Both are included 
in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit available from the Apple 
Store.) Which cable you use depends on whether your stereo or set of 
powered speakers has an optical digital or analog connection.
 
3. Plug AirPort Express into an electrical outlet.

110
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
 Use the AC plug that came with AirPort Express or the power extension 
cord included in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit. AirPort 
Express turns on automatically when connected to an electrical outlet. 
The status light glows yellow while AirPort Express is starting up. When 
it is fully up and running, the light turns green.
 
4. On your computer, set your iTunes preferences to look for speakers 
connected wirelessly with AirTunes.
 
a. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
b. Click the Devices button to get the Devices pane (Figure 6-3).
 
c. Select the Look for Remote Speakers Connected with AirTunes option 
in the Devices pane, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
 In the Devices pane, you also have some options. To control volume from 
a stereo: By default, the iTunes volume control sets the volume for the 
speakers. Select the Disable iTunes Volume Control for Remote Speakers 
option to control speakers separately (a setting you should use if con-
necting to a stereo with a volume control). Allow iTunes control from 
remote speakers: Select this option to allow Apple TV or other speakers

 After turning on the option to look for AirTunes-connected speakers, the 
Speakers pop-up menu appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window if iTunes can locate the speakers. Note: The menu will probably 
be set to Computer, the default option.
 
5. Choose Airtunes-Equipped Network from this new pop-up menu.
 
 The Speakers pop-up menu includes the Computer itself and any avail-
able wireless AirTunes networks, as shown in Figure 6-4. You can select 
the AirTunes network to play music (“Express Buddy” in Figure 6-4). From 
that point, iTunes plays music through the AirTunes network rather than 
through the computer. To get back to playing music through speakers 
connected to the computer (or through the computer’s built-in speakers), 
choose Computer from the Speakers pop-up menu.

Choosing “Express Buddy”
The AirPort Express is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and it 
travels well because all it needs is a power outlet. You can take your laptop 
and AirPort Express to a friend’s house or party, connect the AirPort Express 
to the stereo system and a power outlet, and then use your laptop anywhere 
in its vicinity to play DJ. You can even use portable powered speakers in a 
hotel room without wires and use a hotel room’s LAN-to-Internet access with 
an AirPort Express to connect your wireless computer and other wireless 
computers in the room to the Internet.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
To play music through speakers connected to your Apple TV, choose Apple 
TV from the Speakers pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 6-5. You can use 
any computer with iTunes to play its library content (audio and video) 
through Apple TV to your home entertainment system without your having 
to synchronize that library’s content — meaning you don’t have to change 
the content that is already synchronized with your Apple TV. That way, if 
you invite a friend over with her laptop, you can quickly play any tune in 
her laptop’s library without changing the synchronized content from your 
computer. You can play anything in an iTunes library, even if your Apple TV 
is already filled with synchronized content. (To find out how to synchronize 
your Apple TV, see Chapter 11.)

If you set up your Apple TV to work with an Apple AirPort-based network (as 
I describe in Chapter 7), you can choose the Multiple Speakers option in the 
Speakers pop-up menu (refer to Figure 6-5), and play your iTunes content 
through both the computer and Apple TV speakers at the same time.

 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
Playing Songs
When you’ve found a song you want to play (see Chapter 8 for searching 
details), simply select it in the List pane and then click the Play button. The 
Play button toggles to a Pause button while the song plays. When the song 
finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in sequence until you 
click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the Play button) or 
until the song list ends. This setup is useful if you select an album, but not 
so great if you select a song at random and don’t want to hear the next one. 
(Fortunately, you can arrange songs in playlists so that they play back in 
exactly the sequence you want; see Chapter 10 for details.)
You can skip to the next or previous song by pressing the right- or left-arrow 
keys, respectively, or by clicking the Forward or Back buttons next to the Play 
button. You can also double-click another song in the list to start playing it.
 
Press the spacebar to perform the same function as the Play button; press the 
spacebar again to pause.
You can choose songs to play manually, but iTunes also provides several 
automated features so that you can spend less time prepping your music 
selection and more time enjoying it.
Queuing up tunes with Party Shuffle
Playlists, as I describe in Chapter 10, are great for organizing music in the 
order that you want to play it, but you can have iTunes serve up songs at 
random by using Party Shuffle. Not a dance step or a pub game, Party Shuffle 
is a dynamic playlist that automatically generates a semirandom selection in 
a list that you can modify on the fly. With Party Shuffle, you might even find 
songs in your library you forgot about or rarely play. Party Shuffle always 
throws a few rarely played songs into the mix.
To use Party Shuffle, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Party Shuffle in the Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
 The List pane is replaced with the Party Shuffle track list and settings at 
the bottom, as shown in Figure 6-6.

114
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
Figure 6-6: 
Adjust the 
settings 
for Party 
Shuffle.
 
 
2. Choose a source from the Source pop-up menu below the Party Shuffle 
track list.
 
 You can select Music (for the entire music portion of your library) or 
any playlist (including a smart playlist; see Chapter 10 for details) as the 
source for music in Party Shuffle. If you select a playlist, Party Shuffle 
limits its choices to songs from that playlist.
 
3. Set the following options:
 
• Recently Played Songs: Choose how many songs should remain in the 
Party Shuffle list after they’re played. You can drag already-played 
songs (even though they’re grayed out after playing) to a spot later 
in the list to play them again.
 
• Upcoming Songs: Choose how many songs should be listed as 
upcoming (not yet played). By displaying upcoming songs first, you 
can decide whether to rearrange the list or delete songs from the 
Party Shuffle playlist before they’re played.
 
• Play Higher Rated Songs More Often: Select this option to have 
iTunes add more high-rated songs to the random list. Using this 
option, you weight the randomness in favor of higher-rated songs. 
See Chapter 9 to find out how to add ratings to songs.

115
 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
 
4. (Optional) If you don’t like the order of songs, you can rearrange 
them. If you dislike any songs, you can remove them from the Party 
Shuffle playlist.
 
 You can rearrange the order of songs in Party Shuffle by dragging 
songs to different positions in the Party Shuffle list. Remove songs 
by selecting them in the Party Shuffle playlist and pressing Delete/
Backspace (or choosing Edit➪Delete). Don’t worry — the songs aren’t 
deleted from your library, just from the Party Shuffle playlist.
 
5. Play Party Shuffle by selecting the first song and then clicking the 
Play button or pressing the spacebar.
 
 You can start playing the first song or any song on the list. (When you 
pick a song in the middle to start playing, the songs before it are grayed 
out to show that they won’t play.)
 
6. Add, delete, or rearrange songs even while Party Shuffle plays.
 
 While the Party Shuffle list plays, you can add songs in one of two ways:
 
• Open Party Shuffle in a separate window by double-clicking the Party 
Shuffle item in the Source pane. You can then drag songs from the 
main iTunes window — either from the Music portion of your 
library (select Music in the Library section of the Source pane) or 
from a playlist in the Source pane — directly into position in the 
Party Shuffle track list.
 
• Without opening Party Shuffle in a separate window, you can switch 
to the music portion of your library or a playlist and drag the song to 
the Party Shuffle item in the Source pane. When you add a song to 
Party Shuffle, it shows up at the end of the track list. You can then 
drag it to a new position.
You can add one or more albums to the Party Shuffle track list by dragging the 
albums; the songs play in album order. You can also add all the songs by an 
artist by dragging the artist’s name. Party Shuffle acts like a dynamic playlist — 
you add, delete, and change the order of songs on the fly.
 
Cool DJs mix the Party Shuffle window with other open playlist windows. 
Just double-click the playlist item in the Source pane to open it in a separate 
window. You can then drag songs from different playlist windows to the Party 
Shuffle window while Party Shuffle plays, adding songs in whatever order you 
want in real time.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Cross-fading song playback
You can often hear a song on the radio fade out while another song 
immediately fades in over the first song’s ending — a cross-fade. With iTunes, 
you can smoothly transition from the ending of one song to the beginning of 
the next one. 
What’s totally cool is that you can cross-fade two songs in iTunes even if 
they’re from different sources. The songs could be in your library, in a shared 
library, on CD, or even on one (or more) iPods connected to your computer 
and playing through iTunes. You can play DJ at a party with a massive music 
library on a laptop and enlarge that library with one or more iPods and any 
number of CDs, and have the songs cross-fade.
You can change the cross-fade by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences in Windows, and then clicking the Playback button. The 
Playback preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Set the 
cross-fade 
between 
songs.
 
In the Playback preferences dialog, select the Crossfade Playback option and 
then increase or decrease the cross-fade by dragging the slider. Each notch 
in the slider represents one second. The maximum amount of cross-fade is 12 
seconds. With a longer cross-fade, you get more overlap from one song to the 
next; that is, the second song starts before the first one ends. To turn off the 
cross-fade, deselect the Crossfade Playback check box.

 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
Playing Podcasts
A podcast subscription transfers audio or audio/video episodes, such as weekly 
broadcasts, automatically to your iTunes library from the Internet or through 
the iTunes Store (as I describe in episodic detail in Chapter 5). Podcasts that 
you subscribe to appear in the List pane when you select the Podcasts option in 
the Library section of the Source pane. You can add podcast episodes to your 
library by subscribing to them in the iTunes Store (see Chapter 4) or on a Web 
site (see Chapter 5). To play a podcast episode, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Podcasts option in the Library section of the Source pane.
 
 The podcasts you’ve subscribed to appear in the List pane.
 
2. Select a podcast in the List pane and then click the triangle to see its 
episodes.
 
 The triangle rotates, and a list of episodes appears beneath the podcast, 
as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
3. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
 
 You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind the 
podcast or play it from any point. The blue dot next to a podcast means 
you haven’t yet played it. As soon as you start listening to a podcast, the 
dot disappears.
When you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop 
listening to it, just like it remembers when you place a bookmark in an audio 
book or pause during a movie — even after quitting and restarting iTunes. 
iTunes resumes playing from that playback position when you return to the 
podcast to play it.
Some podcasts are enhanced to include chapter marks and photos. When 
you play an enhanced podcast in iTunes, a Chapters menu appears on the 
iTunes menu bar. Choose this menu to display the podcast’s chapter marks, 
artwork, and chapter start times, as shown in Figure 6-9.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a 
link to a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the 
Artwork pane.
While you can drag a podcast into a playlist to include it in that playlist, you 
can also drag a podcast to the Source pane to create a new playlist, as long as 
you drag it to an empty space in the Playlist section of the Source pane (and 
not into another playlist). The new playlist takes on the name of the podcast. 
You can also add other podcasts to the new playlist, and rename the playlist. 
For more information about playlists, see Chapter 10.

 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
Playing Audio Books
You can store and play audio books, articles, and spoken-word titles just 
like songs in iTunes, and you can download titles from the iTunes Store (as I 
describe prolifically in Chapter 4) or from Audible (www.audible.com; as I 
point out in literary detail in Chapter 5).
By default, iTunes doesn’t include the Audiobooks option in the Library sec-
tion of the Source pane. To place Audiobooks in the Library section of the 
Source pane so that you can select audio books, choose iTunes➪Preferences 
(Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click the General button at the top 
of the Preferences window, and select Audiobooks next to the Show option. 
Click OK to accept the changes. Audiobooks then appears as its own head-
ing in the Library section of the Source pane; click the heading to see a list of 
your audio books.
To play an audio book, select it just like you would a song (see details on 
browsing and listing content in Chapter 8) and then click the Play button. 
You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind the audio 
book or play it from any point.
Audio books from Audible and the iTunes Store are enhanced to include 
chapter marks. When you play any of these audio books in iTunes, the 
Chapters menu appears on the iTunes menu bar, just like it does for a podcast 
with chapters. Choose the Chapters menu to display and select the audio 
book’s chapter marks (refer to Figure 6-9).
Playing Videos
iTunes is versatile when it comes to playing videos — the TV shows, movies, 
video podcasts, and music videos you downloaded from the iTunes Store 
(see Chapter 4) as well as the video files you dragged into iTunes from other 
sources (see Chapter 5).
To watch a video in iTunes, select it in your library (see details on browsing 
and listing movies, TV shows, and videos in Chapter 8), and then click the Play 
button. Use the iTunes Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Forward/Next buttons 
to control playback and the iTunes volume slider to control the volume, just like 
with songs.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
The video appears in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the 
iTunes window, as shown in Figure 6-10. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, 
playing the video makes it appear. You can also make the Artwork pane 
appear or disappear by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button.
Besides the Artwork pane (which is too small for normal viewing), you can 
view your video
 
 In a separate window at different sizes
 
 Inside the iTunes window
 
 Filling the entire computer display
 
 On a TV
In the following sections, I tell you how to get your video out of that puny 
Artwork pane and into larger displays.

To watch a video in a separate window, click the video while it plays in the 
Artwork pane. A separate window appears that includes a transparent 
QuickTime controls pane with buttons for controlling video playback, as

shown in Figure 6-11. Click the Play button at the center of the pane to play 
or pause, and then drag the slider to move forward or backward through 
the video. Click the Rewind or Fast-Forward buttons on either side of the 
Play button in the controls pane to move backward or forward through 
a video. Click the red “close window” button in the top-left corner to close 
the window.

To set your iTunes preferences to always play movies and TV shows in a separate 
window, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows). Next, 
click the Playback button and then choose the In a Separate Window option for 
the Play Movies and TV Shows pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 6-12. You can also 
choose this option for the Play Music Videos pop-up menu. From that point on, 
those videos in your library play in a separate window.
The transparent QuickTime controls pane disappears while the video plays, but 
you can make it reappear at any time by moving the cursor to the bottom center 
of the video window. The controls pane also offers a volume control slider to set 
the audio volume of the video, and the Full-Screen Video button to change the 
video display to full-screen. (See the section “Playing a video full-screen.”) 
You can resize the separate video window by dragging the lower-right corner 
of the window. You can also choose fixed window sizes by choosing them 
from the View menu. For example, choose View➪Video Size➪Half Size to 
display the video window at half the actual size, or View➪Video Size➪Double 
Size to display the window at twice the size. Choose View➪Video Size➪
Actual Size to set the window back to the actual size of the video picture.

In the iTunes Window option for the Play Movies and TV Shows and/or Play 
Music Videos pop-up menus (refer to Figure 6-12). 
From that point on, those videos in your library play inside the iTunes 
window with a transparent QuickTime controls pane offering buttons for con-
trolling video playback, as shown in Figure 6-13. Click the Play button at the 
center of the QuickTime controls pane to play or pause, and then drag the 
slider to move forward or backward through the video. Click the Rewind or 
Fast-Forward buttons on either side of the Play button in the controls pane to 
move backward or forward through a video. Click the circled X to stop 
playing the video and return to the normal iTunes window.
Playing a video full-screen
To set your iTunes preferences to play movies, TV shows, and/or music 
videos full-screen, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences

look pixilated at full-screen resolution.
 
 To change from watching a video in a separate window to a full-screen view, 
click the Full-Screen Video button in the transparent QuickTime controls 
pane (refer to Figure 6-11). This button doesn’t appear unless you’re playing 
a video in a separate window. You can also choose View➪Video Size➪Full 
Screen.
When you’re playing a video in full-screen view, the following controls are 
available:
 
 Esc (Escape): Press to stop full-screen playback and return to the iTunes 
window.
 
 Spacebar: Press to pause playback. (Pressing the spacebar again 
resumes playback.)
 
 Your mouse or pointing device: Simply move these to display the trans-

A cool party trick is to seamlessly mix music videos and music with 
visuals. (See Chapter 3 to find out about displaying visuals.) To create a 
mixed playlist of music and videos (see Chapter 10 to create playlists), 
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows). Then 
click the Playback button and choose the Full Screen (with Visuals) option 
from the Play Music Videos pop-up menu (or even the Play Movies and TV 
Shows pop-up menu, if you include these in your playlist). When you play 
the mixed music-video playlist, iTunes automatically shows full-screen video 
for your videos and full-screen visuals for your music, seamlessly moving 
from one to the other.
Playing videos through iTunes on your TV
For many, the computer display is just fine for viewing videos full-screen. The 
picture clarity on a Mac (even Mac PowerBook and iBook), for example, is 
better than any comparably sized television. However, if you want to connect 
your PC to a television, follow the instructions that came with your PC. 
You can connect a Mac to a television that offers an S-video, composite 
video, or component video connection, and also connect the Mac to speakers 
or a sound system through standard RCA audio connections for sound. 
 
You can connect an iPod or iPhone directly to a television and sound system or 
through a dock, and the connections are similar if not exactly the same as ones 
you might use to connect your computer. To learn more about connections to 
home video and stereo equipment, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
After connecting to the television and to the speakers/sound system, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu.
 
 The System Preferences window appears with icons for each set of 
preferences.
 
2. Click the Displays icon in the System Preferences window.
 
 The Display preferences window appears. Depending on the type of 
display, you might see tabs for different panes.
 
3. Click the Display tab for the Display preferences pane if it isn’t 
already selected.
 
 The preferences appear with settings for your display.

125
 Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes
 
4. Click the Detect Displays button.
 
 The Mac detects the television and sets it to the appropriate resolution. 
For more about setting display resolutions on the Mac, see Mac OS X 
Leopard All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers 
(Wiley).
 
If you don’t see a picture on your television, be sure your TV is set to the correct 
input source: composite video input (RCA connectors), component video input, 
or S-video input. You can also use other types of video equipment. For example, 
a video recorder, which typically accepts RCA or S-video input, can record the 
video, and a video projector can display it on a large screen.
Perhaps the easiest way to connect your computer (and other computers in 
your local network) to your television and stereo system is through Apple TV. 
Apple TV lets you connect wirelessly (or by wired Ethernet) to any computer 
running iTunes in the network and store content for playback. See Chapter 7 
for details on sharing your iTunes library using Apple TV.

Sharing Content Legally
In This Chapter
 Sharing content purchased from the iTunes Store
 Using a local area network to share an iTunes library
 Setting up Apple TV
 Copying media files to other drives and computers
H
ey, it’s your content after you buy it — that is, to the extent that you 
can make copies for yourself. You want to play your music and videos 
anywhere and even share them with your friends. It’s only natural.
And to help, iTunes lets you share a library over a local area network (LAN) 
with other computers running iTunes.
 
If you use a Wi-Fi (wireless) network, consider getting an Apple TV, which 
connects wirelessly to your network and with high-quality cabling to your 
television and stereo system. You can then share any iTunes library on any 
computer on the network with Apple TV to play on your TV and stereo.
You can also copy the content files to other computers without any restric-
tions on copying — just keep in mind that protected content has some 
playback restrictions. You can easily share the music that you rip from your 
CDs: After the music becomes digital, you can copy it endlessly with no sub-
sequent loss in quality. You can also share the songs, audio books, podcasts, 
and videos that you download. Of course, if the songs, audio books, and 
videos are in a protected format (such as content bought from the iTunes 
Store), the computers that access the shared library must be authorized to 
play the content. Whether the computers are connected to a LAN by cable 
(such as Ethernet) or by wireless technology (such as the Apple AirPort or 
Time Capsule), you can share your library with other computers — up to five 
other computers in a single 24-hour period.
In this chapter, I show you how to share your iTunes library with others. 
(After all, your parents taught you to share, didn’t they?)

128
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Sharing Content from the iTunes Store
To a limited extent, you can share all the content that you buy online from 
the iTunes Store. Some content — such as free podcasts as well as unpro-
tected songs and albums (also known as “iTunes Plus” songs) — can be 
shared without any limitations. However, some songs and albums, and 
most commercial movies, music videos, TV shows, audio books, and paid 
podcasts are all limited by copy protection, also known as digital rights 
management (DRM).
You can play unprotected songs on any computer or any digital-audio player. 
Entire albums and individual songs are available in a higher-quality, non-
DRM “iTunes Plus” format from some record labels alongside DRM-protected 
songs from other labels also sold through iTunes. And if you’ve already pur-
chased DRM-protected songs in the past that are now available in the iTunes 
Plus format, you can upgrade them to iTunes Plus — for a price, typically 30 
cents per song.
The Apple form of DRM is known as FairPlay, and it works with the standard 
AAC encoding format. Protected files are keyed to an individual purchaser’s 
identity. Although they can be copied to and from computers, they can’t be 
played on a given computer unless that computer has been authorized.
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, visit this book’s companion 
Web site. 
Apple employs FairPlay protection for songs from many record labels, while 
other songs are available without FairPlay (it’s the record label’s choice). 
FairPlay-protected songs use the .m4p filename extension rather than .m4a 
for the unprotected AAC format. Apple also uses a protected video format 
for TV shows, music videos, and movies in the online store. These filenames 
use the .m4v or .mp4 extension for protected video rather than .mpg for the 
standard MPEG-4 format.
 
Unprotected AAC files are as freely portable and playable as MP3 files are. 
You can send an unprotected AAC file to anyone else with iTunes or any 
other software capable of reading AAC files, and the recipient can play it 
successfully.
 
To tell whether a song purchased from the iTunes Store is protected with 
FairPlay, select the song and choose File➪Get Info. Next to the Kind head-
ing you’ll see “Protected AAC Audio File” for FairPlay-protected songs or 
“Purchased AAC Audio File” for unprotected songs purchased from the 
iTunes Store.

129
 Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally
The FairPlay protection used with iTunes Store content allows you to do the 
following:
 
 Create backups. You can download the content files and make as many 
copies as you want on hard drives and storage devices; you can even 
burn data CDs and DVDs with content files for backup purposes. (There 
is no limit on the number of data CDs you can make.)
 
 Copy content to iTunes libraries on other computers. Play songs and 
videos on up to five separate computers. See Chapter 4 to find out how 
to authorize your computers.
 
 Copy content to iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV. Copy the music and 
videos to as many iPods and iPhones as you want as well as to Apple TV. 
See Chapter 11 for automatic and manual device synchronization.
I fought the law, and the law won: 
Sharing and piracy
Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave personal demon-
strations of the iTunes Store and the iPod to 
Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger before intro-
ducing the online store. According to Steven 
Levy at Newsweek (May 12, 2003), Jobs said, 
“They both totally get it.” The former Beatle 
and the Stones’ frontman are no slouches: Both 
conduct music-business affairs personally and 
have extensive back catalogs of music. They 
know all about the free music-swapping ser-
vices on the Internet, but they agree with Jobs 
that most people are willing to pay for high-
quality music rather than download free copies 
of questionable quality.
Digital Rights Management (DRM), also known 
as copy protection, is ineffective against piracy 
because determined pirates always circumvent 
it with newer technology; only consumers are 
inconvenienced.
The record labels are finally “getting it” as well. 
EMI, one of the largest, agreed in the spring of 
2007 to sell unprotected “iTunes Plus” songs 
and albums — some at a higher price ($1.29 per 
song) — but without DRM getting in the way. 
Many of the songs available from free sharing 
services are low-quality MP3 audio files, which 
sound only as good as an FM radio broadcast. 
The iTunes Store offers quite a lot of licensed 
music in an unprotected format that offers 
higher-quality sound, as well as protected 
songs, and I prefer the original authorized ver-
sion of the song — not some knockoff that might 
have been copied from a radio broadcast.
As for copying songs for personal use, the law 
is murky at best. You can mix hit songs in with 
your personal videos, but don’t expect to see

for very long. (YouTube and other video sharing 
sites police their sites for unauthorized content.) 
Whether you’re interested in obtaining the rights 
to music to use in semipublic or public presen-
tations or even movies and documentaries for 
public distribution, you can contact the music 
publisher or a licensing agent. Music publish-
ing organizations, such as the Music Publishers’ 
Association (www.mpa.org), offer information 
and lists of music publishers as well as explana-
tions of various rights and licenses.

 Burn up to seven audio CDs. Burn seven copies of the same playlist 
containing protected songs to an audio CD — but no more. See Chapter 
12 for tips on CD and DVD burning.
 
 Share content over a network. Up to five computers running iTunes on 
a LAN can play the content in your shared library in a 24-hour period.
 
You can also play music in your library over a wireless connection to a stereo 
amplifier or receiver by using AirTunes and AirPort Express, which I cover in 
Chapter 6.
You might also want to know where the songs, audio books, podcasts, and 
videos are stored on your hard drive so that you can copy the content to 
other computers and hard drives and create a backup of your entire library. 
You might want to move the library to another computer because computers 
just keep getting better year after year. To find the location of your content 
files, see Chapter 12.
Sharing Content on a Network
If you live like the Jetsons — with a computer in every room connected by 
a wireless or wired network — iTunes is made for you. You can share your 
iTunes library with other computers in the same network. These computers 
can be PCs that run Windows or Macs that run OS X — as long as they run 
iTunes. If they can communicate with each other over the network, iTunes 
can share a content library with up to five PCs in a single 24-hour period. The 
restriction to five in a 24-hour period is yet another one of the imposed rules 
of record labels and video producers.
When you share content on a network, the content is streamed over the net-
work from the computer that contains the library (the library computer) to 
the computer that plays it. A stream arrives in the receiving computer bit 
by bit; the computer starts playing the stream as soon as the first set of bits 
arrive, and more sections are transferred while you listen. The result is that 
the recipient hears music and sees video as a continual stream. Broadcasters 
use this technology to continually transmit new content (just like a radio 
station). The content isn’t copied to the receiving computer’s library, and 
you can’t burn the shared library songs onto a CD or copy the songs to an 
iPod without third-party software — such as WireTap Pro for the Mac (www.
ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap) or Blaze Media Pro for Windows 
(www.blazemp.com).
 
Sharing an iTunes library can be incredibly useful for playing content on lap-
tops that connect to a wireless network. You can manage a very large content 
library on a desktop computer with a large hard drive, and then play content 
on the laptop or notebook computer with a smaller hard drive without having 
to copy files to the smaller hard drive.

Sharing your library with other computers
To share your iTunes library — turning your computer into the library 
 computer — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows) 
and then click the Sharing tab.
 
 The Sharing dialog appears, as shown in Figure 7-1, offering options for 
sharing music.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Share your 
iTunes 
library with 
other com-
puters on 
the same 
network.
 
 
2. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network option.
 
3. Select either the Share Entire Library option or the Share Selected 
Playlists option and then choose the playlists to share.
 
4. Add a password if you want to restrict access to the shared library or 
playlists.
 
 Pick a password that you don’t mind sharing with others; for example, 
your name is a good password, because you want to share it with people 
you know. Your ATM PIN is not a good password, because you should 
keep that very secure. The password restricts access to only those who 
know it.
 
 iTunes displays Reminder: Sharing music is for personal 
use only.
 
5. Click OK.

132
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Shared libraries or playlists appear in the iTunes Source list in the Shared 
section with the computer’s username. (For example, “Tony Bove’s Music” is 
the name of the shared library on the computer where “Tony Bove” is logged 
in as the user.)
 
You can change the Library name that iTunes uses for your shared library 
or playlists. To change the name others see, choose iTunes➪Preferences on 
a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, click General, and then type a new 
name in the Library Name field. The name that you choose appears in the 
Shared section of the iTunes Source pane for other computers that share your 
library.
 
Before turning off sharing for your library, you must first notify anyone 
sharing the library to eject the shared library. Otherwise, iTunes displays a 
warning dialog allowing you to continue (and break off the connection to the 
shared library) or to leave sharing turned on for the moment.
Accessing a shared library
You can access the content from the other computers on the network by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in 
Windows and then click the Sharing tab.
 
 The Sharing dialog appears and offers options for sharing content. Refer 
to Figure 7-1.
 
2. Select the Look for Shared Libraries option.
 
 The shared libraries appear in the Shared section of the Source pane, as 
shown in Figure 7-2 (“Tony Bove’s Music” loading into iTunes). 
 
3. Select and play any album or song in the shared library.
 
 After the shared library loads, its contents appear in the List pane, as 
shown in Figure 7-3, and you can browse and play its contents.
 
4. (Optional) Click the triangle next to a shared library entry in the 
Source pane, as shown in Figure 7-3, to see playlists in the shared 
library. Play them as you normally would.
 
5. To unload the shared library, click the tiny Eject button that appears 
to the right of the shared library name in the Source pane.

Sharing Content with Your Apple TV
Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to play the content in your iTunes library on 
your television and stereo system without having to mess with cables? You 
can. Just sit back on your couch and let Apple TV offer up a smorgasbord of 
content from your iTunes library, which can be on your computer in another 
room and streamed to Apple TV over the network. You can also transfer con-
tent to your Apple TV so that you don’t have to use your computer to play 
the content or even have your computer on while playing content.
Apple TV (about $300) is like a large iPod that wirelessly synchronizes with 
one or more iTunes libraries on Macs and PCs and stores that content on its 
hard drive to play on your high-definition (HD) television and stereo system. 
Apple TV can also wirelessly connect to a computer’s iTunes library and play 
it. It also supports AirTunes, as I describe in Chapter 6, so that you can play 
your iTunes content on your computer and redirect the sound wirelessly to 
Apple TV as a separate speaker system. 
With Apple TV, you can rent or buy movies in high-definition (HD) format and 
download them directly to Apple TV’s hard drive to watch on your HD televi-
sion with full surround sound. You can listen to music and podcasts in your 
iTunes library through your home stereo and show photo slideshows with 
music. It’s the wave of the future — couch potatoes kicking back with Apple 
consumer gear.
You control Apple TV with the handheld wireless Apple Remote, which is 
supplied with Apple TV and uses Apple TV’s built-in infrared (IR) receiver. 
The menus for playing content and changing Apple TV settings appear on 
your television, so you can sit back on your couch and tune in to anything 
synchronized from your iTunes library. You can also play all the music in 
an iTunes library, streamed from the computer running iTunes, without syn-
chronizing the entire library. Synchronizing content is useful if you want to 
turn off the computer and play Apple TV by itself.
Apple TV hardware isn’t much different than a low-end laptop computer; it 
runs a slimmed version of Mac OS X. Apple TV requires a Mac or PC running 
iTunes version 7.6 or newer, but you should use the newest version of iTunes 
to take advantage of all its features. (See Chapter 2 for detailed requirements 
for running iTunes.) Apple TV works with widescreen, enhanced-definition, 
or high-definition TVs capable of 1080i, 720p, 576p, or 480p resolutions. The 
iTunes Store offers HD movies using the HDTV (high-definition television) 
format for Apple TV.
The first generation Apple TV includes a 40GB model and a 160GB model for 
synchronizing with iTunes. With the 40GB model, you can synchronize up to 50 
hours of movies and TV shows, or you can fill it up with 9,000 songs (or about 
25,000 pictures) and play them on your TV and stereo. With the 160GB model, 
you can synchronize up to 200 hours of video or fill it up with 36,000 songs. 

135
 Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally
Setting up Apple TV
Apple TV works transparently with a PC or Mac, taking advantage of the broad-
band connection to the Internet via your wireless network. It supports AirPort 
Extreme, Wi-Fi 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n wireless networks. (Wireless video 
streaming requires 802.11g or 802.11n.) AirPort Extreme–enabled Macs let you 
create a wireless network using only your computer and Apple TV. (If you have 
a Mac or PC without wireless capability, though, you can connect Apple TV to a 
10/100BASE-T Ethernet network using an Ethernet cable that’s sold separately.) 
To connect the device (only 1.1 inches thick and 7.7 inches square) to your 
TV or audio-video (AV) receiver, use one of the following methods, as shown 
in Figure 7-4:
 
 For TVs with stereo or surround sound that support High-Definition 
Multimedia Interface (HDMI): Use an HDMI cable, which provides video 
and audio to the television/audio system. The Apple Store offers HDMI-
to-HDMI cables for TVs and AV receivers that support HDMI.
 
 For TVs that support Digital Video Interface (DVI): Use an HDMI-to-DVI 
cable or an HDMI-DVI adapter for an HDMI cable, both of which are avail-
able from the Apple Store. Then use either an optical audio cable or a 
standard analog audio cable pair to provide audio to your stereo or sur-
round sound system.
 
 For TVs or AV receivers that don’t offer HDMI or DVI (or if these ports 
are used by other devices, such as your cable receiver): Use a com-
ponent video cable (with three connectors) and either an optical audio 
cable or a standard analog audio cable pair.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
You should connect Apple TV to your TV and stereo first before proceeding 
so that when you connect Apple TV to power, you see the menu for Apple TV 
on your television.
Choosing an iTunes library for Apple TV
When you first connect Apple TV to a power source, it immediately starts 
its setup procedure, using your television as the display. Grab your Apple 
Remote (supplied with Apple TV) and follow these instructions — all from 
the comfort of your couch:
 
1. Choose a language.
 
 Point the Apple Remote at the Apple TV and use the remote’s buttons to 
navigate up and down the list and select a language. The plus (+) button 
scrolls up, the minus (–) button scrolls down, and the Play/Pause button 
selects a menu choice. After you choose a language, Apple TV displays 
the network screen.
 
2. Select a network.
 
 Apple TV searches for a wireless network unless you’ve connected it to 
an Ethernet network (in which case Apple TV automatically detects it, 
and that’s that). For wireless networks, follow the on-TV instructions to 
select your network by name and (if necessary) supply a password by 
using the Apple Remote to navigate the individual letters of the pass-
word. You can even manually configure the IP address, subnet mask, 
router, and DNS address if your network doesn’t allow DHCP connec-
tions or you need to for other reasons. (I’m assuming here that you 
know what you’re doing — if not, get help from the person who set up 
your network.)
 
 After setting up your network connection, Apple TV displays a five-digit 
passcode on your TV that identifies the device for synchronization with 
a computer.
 
3. Remember (or write down) your five-digit passcode.
 
 The next step is to get off your couch and go over to your computer — 
which can be in the next room, as long as it accesses the same network 
as Apple TV. Then follow these steps:
 
4. Start iTunes.
 
 Shortly (a minute or less), the Apple TV icon and name appear in the 
Source pane under Devices.

137
 Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally
 
5. Select Apple TV in the Devices section of the Source pane (see Figure 7-5) 
and enter the five-digit passcode into the digit fields.
 
 This passcode appears on your TV; refer to Step 3 in this step list.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Set up 
Apple TV in 
iTunes to 
synchronize 
with the 
library.
 
 
 The digit fields appear on the iTunes page, to the right of the Source 
pane. After entering the fifth digit, iTunes displays a page that lets you 
enter the name for your Apple TV, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Provide a 
new name 
for your

138
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
 
6. Give your Apple TV a new name.
 
 Enter a new name that befits the new king of the living room and then 
click OK. iTunes then displays the registration page for Apple TV.
 
7. Register your Apple TV or skip registration if you want.
 
 Click Continue (to register), Later (to register later), or Never Register 
(to skip registration). I recommend registering your Apple TV in order 
to maintain your warranty (and optionally receive e-mail notices of 
updates). If you choose to register, follow the instructions to enter your 
Apple ID and password (or select the option for no ID) and then click 
Continue. Fill out your personal information and then click Continue to 
finish the registration process. iTunes then takes you to the online store, 
so that you can start purchasing content or renting movies immediately.
Your new Apple TV starts synchronizing automatically with your iTunes 
library, copying movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and photos (in that 
order) until it runs out of space. If your iTunes library is larger than the capac-
ity of your Apple TV, you will need to manage content synchronization — 
see Chapter 11. You can synchronize Apple TV with an iTunes library on any 
Mac or PC within reach of the network. When you make any changes to your 
library in iTunes, Apple TV automatically synchronizes with your (updated) 
library.
To play content on Apple TV, use the Apple Remote to choose from the 
Apple TV main menu. You can select Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, 
Photos, and YouTube; or, choose Settings to change your Apple TV settings 
or change sources of content.
Copying Media Files
You can copy content freely from your iTunes window to other hard drives 
and computers or copy the content folders from the iTunes Music folder to 
other hard drives and computers. On a Mac, you can use the Finder to copy 
content files as well as drag stuff from the iTunes window into folders or 
hard drives. Windows PCs offer several methods, including using Windows 
Explorer to copy files.
By default, the files are organized in folders by artist name and by album title 
(or by book, video, or TV show title) within the iTunes Music folder — that 
is, unless you change options in the Advanced section of iTunes Preferences; 

139
 Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally
see Chapter 12. For example, copying an entire album, or every song by 
a specific artist, is easy — just drag the folder to its new home folder on 
another hard drive.
 
You can find out the location of any content item by selecting it in iTunes and 
choosing File➪Get Info. Click the Summary tab in the Get Info dialog to see 
the Summary options. Although you can change the location of your iTunes 
library, most people leave the library in its default location, which is inside 
the iTunes Music folder in the iTunes folder on the startup hard drive, as I 
describe in Chapter 12.
 
The easiest way to copy an album from a folder on a hard drive into your 
iTunes library is to drag the album’s folder over the iTunes window and drop 
it there. If you drop it into the Source pane, iTunes creates a playlist of the 
album’s songs using the album name. To copy individual songs, you can drag 
the song files over the iTunes window and drop them in the List pane. When 
you add a piece of content (song, video, podcast, or audio book) to your 
iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the iTunes Music folder. An alternative, 
if your display is already crowded with windows, is to choose File➪Add to 
Library on a Mac, or File➪Add Folder to Library on a Windows PC, and select 
the album’s folder.

and Sorting in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Browsing your iTunes library
 Changing options for viewing your content
 Sorting content by view options
 Searching for content in the library
 Finding pesky duplicates
 Deleting items from the library
You rip a few CDs, buy some songs and movies from the iTunes Store, 
and you’re hooked. You keep adding more and more content to your 
library and forget how to find items you added last month. It’s time to dis-
cover how to organize your content and navigate your iTunes library.
The iTunes library is awesome, even by everyday jukebox standards. Even 
though previous versions were limited to a paltry (cough!) 32,000 files per 
library, and you had to create multiple libraries to get around that limit, the 
current version (actually all versions newer than version 4) can virtually hold 
an unlimited number of files. Of course, the limit depends entirely on how 
much space you have on your hard drive.
Even if you keep your iTunes library down to the size of what fits on your iPod 
or iPhone, you still have a formidable collection at your fingertips. If your con-
tent collection is getting large, organize it to make finding songs, audio books, 
podcasts, and videos easier. After all, finding U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What 
I’m Looking For” is a challenge even in a library of “only” 32,000 songs.
This chapter shows you how to search, browse, and sort your iTunes library. 
You can find any media, application, game, or radio station in seconds. You 
can also change the viewing options to make your library’s display more 
useful, such as displaying songs sorted by artist, album, genre, or other attri-
butes, or sorting TV shows by season or episode.

144
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Browsing Your Library Content
The iTunes window provides the List pane on the right side and the Source 
pane on the left side (refer to Figure 3-1 in Chapter 3). The List pane offers a 
view of your library and content, depending on which sources of content you 
choose in the Source pane on the left side. The choices in the Source pane 
are as follows:
 
 Library section: Select Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Radio, 
or Ringtones. By default, iTunes doesn’t display Audiobooks and 
Applications; to see these content types, or to change the options 
listed in the Library section, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or 
Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click the General tab at the top of the 
Preferences window, and select or deselect the Show options depending 
on what you want to display. Click OK to accept the changes.
 
• Music: Lists the entire library of songs and music videos, pur-
chased, downloaded, ripped, or copied into the library.
 
• Movies: Lists the movies downloaded from the iTunes Store and 
movie files you’ve added to your library.
 
• TV Shows: Lists TV shows downloaded from the iTunes Store.
 
• Podcasts: Lists the podcasts you’ve subscribed to. (See Chapter 5 
for details on subscribing to and browsing podcasts.)
 
• Audiobooks: Lists the audio books downloaded from the iTunes 
Store or from Audible.com or other sources. (See Chapter 6 for 
details on playing audio books.)
 
• Applications: Lists the iPod touch and iPhone applications down-
loaded from the App Store or iTunes Store, and iPod games down-
loaded from the iTunes Store.
 
• Radio: Lists the Web radio stations you can play. Radio station 
content is streamed to your computer but not stored in your 
library.
 
• Ringtones: Lists the ringtones purchased in the iTunes Store.
 
 Store section: The iTunes Store (see Chapter 4).
 
 Devices section: Your iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and other devices appear 
here. When you select a device such as an iPod, iTunes displays the 
summary page with synchronization options. See Chapter 11 for details 
on navigating the library on an iPod set for managing content manually.
 
 Playlist section: Smart playlists and regular playlists appear in this sec-
tion, along with the Genius button (see Chapter 10). Also appearing in 
this section is Party Shuffle, which lists the Party Shuffle playlist (see 
Chapter 6). 

145
 Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
Overwhelmed by all the content in the List pane? Try browsing. iTunes offers 
three View buttons in the upper-right corner for browsing your content in the 
List pane:
 
 List (the left button, or choose View➪As List) shows items in a list. 
Choose View➪Show Browser to show the browser, which displays col-
umns you can browse to easily find items, such as music albums or TV 
episodes. The browser appears in the top part of the List pane (peek 
ahead to Figure 8-3 to see it). To make the browser disappear and see 
your content in a full list, choose View➪Hide Browser. You can also 
display songs in a list with the album cover art by choosing View➪Show 
Artwork Column. (Turn this off by choosing View➪Hide Artwork 
Column.)
 
 Grid (the center button, or choose View➪As Grid) shows thumbnail 
cover art images in a grid, as shown in Figure 8-1. Double-click a thumb-
nail to display a list of albums with an artwork column.
 
 Cover Flow (the right button, or choose View➪As Cover Flow) shows 
the cover browser, also known as Cover Flow, as described in the 
upcoming section, “Browsing by cover art.”

Browsing by cover art with Cover Flow
Does viewing a cover whet your appetite for the music, story, or video 
inside? Of course it does. Covers provide a context that simply can’t be put 
into words or conveyed by sound. One fantastic innovation of iTunes is how 
it integrates cover art from albums, books, podcasts, and videos with your 
library so that you can flip through your content to find items based on the 
artwork. Figure 8-2 shows the iTunes window using Cover Flow view to dis-
play the Music portion of the iTunes library. 
To select Cover Flow, click the rightmost of the three View buttons in the 
upper-right corner of the iTunes window. You can also show the cover 
browser by choosing View➪As Cover Flow.
Cover Flow lets you flip through your cover art to select music, movies, TV 
shows, podcasts, and audio books. (The cover browser doesn’t work with 
ringtones, applications, or radio stations.) Just drag the slider to scroll 
swiftly through your library or click to the right or left of the cover art in 
the foreground to move forward or backward, respectively. When you scroll 
or click through cover art, the content items in the List pane also change. 
Double-click the foreground cover art to start playing the first item — 
whether it’s an album’s first song, a movie, the first chapter of an audio book, 
or the first episode of a TV show.

 Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
Click the Browse Full-Screen button to display Cover Flow, um, full-screen. 
You can still click a cover to select an album, click within each cover to move 
forward and backward, and use the cover browser’s slider to navigate your 
library. iTunes also offers a volume control slider to set the audio volume 
while browsing full-screen cover art. Press Esc (Escape) or click the Browse 
Full-Screen button (with its arrows pointing inward) in the lower-right corner 
of the display to stop displaying the cover browser full-screen and return to 
the iTunes window.
To fill your library automatically with cover art, get yourself an iTunes Store 
account (if you don’t already have one). Log in to your account; then choose 
Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the cover art not only for con-
tent downloaded from the iTunes Store — including movies, TV shows, audio 
books and podcasts — but also for CDs you ripped, provided that the albums 
are also available in the iTunes Store. Even if you downloaded or ripped only 
one song of an album, you get the album’s cover art for that song.
You can also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs, audio books, 
and DVDs (including Amazon.com) or even scan them from the actual CDs, 
DVDs, or books. You can then add cover art from a scanned or downloaded 
image file to any content item in your iTunes library, as I describe in Chapter 9. 
The optimal size for cover art is 300 x 300 pixels.
Browsing songs by artist and album
To browse music in your library, select Music in the Source pane in the 
Library section. The List view shows the title of each song in the Name 
column, the artist or band name in the Artist column, and the title of the 
album in the Album column. The browser in List view organizes songs by 
Genre, Artist, and Album. You can switch to Grid (refer to Figure 8-1) or to 
Cover Flow view (refer to Figure 8-2) to show the album cover art.
Select a genre in the Genre column to see artists in that genre or select All 
at the top of the column to see all artists for all genres. When you select an 
artist in the Artist column (the middle column; see Figure 8-3), the album 
titles appear in the Album column (on the right). When you select an album 
in Browse view, iTunes displays only the songs for that album in the List 
pane below the browser.
 
To see more than one album from an artist at a time, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl 
(Windows) and then click each album name.
When you select different albums in the Album column, the List pane below 
the browser displays the songs from that album. The songs are listed in 
proper track order, just as the artist, producer, or record label intended.

148
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Select an 
artist to see 
the list of 
albums for 
that artist.
 
 
If you don’t get track information from the Internet for each song (as I show 
dramatically in Chapter 5) or add the track information yourself via the con-
tent item’s information dialog (as I describe in wondrous detail in Chapter 9), 
iTunes displays only a blank space for the Artist and Album name along with 
Track 01 and so on for each track. That makes browsing for a song or artist by 
name difficult, to say the least.
 
To see all the songs in the library in the browser, select All at the top of each 
of the columns — Genre, Artist, and Album.
Note: iTunes version 7.1.1 and newer versions no longer consider Clash and 
The Clash to be different music groups, sorting them properly under the 
letter C. I show you how to edit the artist name and other information in 
Chapter 9.
Browsing audio books
If you don’t see Audiobooks in the in the Library section of the Source pane, 
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click 
the General tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Audiobooks 
option next to the Show heading, and click OK. The Audiobooks option then 
appears in the Source pane in the Library section.

 Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
To browse the audio books in your library, select Audiobooks in the Source 
pane. The List view shows the title of each book with its part number (long 
books typically have multiple parts) in the Name column, and the author’s name 
in the Artist column. If you add the Album column heading to your List view (as 
I describe in the section, “Changing the List view options,” later in this chapter), 
the title of the book appears in the Album column. The browser in List view orga-
nizes audio books by Genre, Artist (the author), and Album (the book). 
Browsing podcasts
To browse podcasts, select Podcasts in the Library section of the Source 
pane. The podcasts appear in the List pane. You can then see the episodes of 
a podcast by clicking the triangle next to the podcast name, and play the epi-
sode, as I describe in Chapter 6.
The List view shows the title of each podcast and its episodes in the Podcast 
column. The browser in List view organizes podcasts by Genre, Artist (pod-
cast author), and Album (podcast title). The Grid and Cover Flow views show 
the cover art for the podcast. The mysterious blue dot next to a podcast 
means you haven’t played one or more episodes of the podcast yet. (The 
same blue dot appears next to each unplayed episode.) As soon as you start 
listening to or watching a podcast, the dot disappears (accompanied by the 
theme of The Twilight Zone).
You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast listing margin to display 
separate information about the podcast’s newest episode.
Browsing movies, videos, and TV shows
To browse movies, select Movies in the Library section of the Source pane. 
Any video files you add to your library from sources other than the iTunes 
Store are classified as movies. You can also find in the Movies listing those 
movies and short films you downloaded from the iTunes Store.
The List view shows the title of each movie in the Name column, and the 
browser in List view organizes movies by Genre, Artist, and Album. The Grid 
view (as shown in Figure 8-4) and the Cover Flow view show the first key 
frame of the movie or the box cover art for the movie. 
You can browse TV shows downloaded from the iTunes Store (or any video 
set as TV Show with the Media Kind option, as described in Chapter 9) by 
selecting TV Shows in the Library section of the Source pane. The List view 
shows the episode title, show title, and season number. The browser in List 
view organizes TV shows by Genre, Show, and Season. The Grid and Cover 
Flow views show the promotional cover art for the TV show.

Browsing applications and iPod games
Your iPod or iPhone is, in a sense, a pocket game machine as well as a tiny 
computer that runs applications. iPods that play video can also play games 
you can purchase and download from the iTunes Store, and the iPod touch 
and iPhone can run applications available in the App Store (see Chapter 4). 
And although you can’t run the applications or play the games in iTunes, you 
can browse the list of applications and games you downloaded.
If you don’t see Applications in the Library section of the Source pane, 
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click 
the General tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Applications 
option from the list of options for the Show heading, and click OK. The 
Applications option then appears in the Source pane in the Library section.
To browse iPod touch or iPhone applications and games, or iPod “click wheel” 
games, select Applications in the Source pane. A scrollable pane appears to the 
right of the Source pane, displaying thumbnail images of the applications and 
games, divided into sections for iPhone and iPod touch Apps, and iPod Games. 
Click a thumbnail image to see a description of the application or game.
 
In case you’re a closet gamer, Chapter 4 shows you how to browse games and 
apps in the iTunes Store. Visit this book’s companion Web site for details on 
how to use iPod and iPhone applications and play games.

Displaying Content in List View
To display your content in the List pane as a list, click the left View button 
(refer to Figure 8-1). Choose View➪Show Browser to show the browser in the 
top part of the List pane in List view, or View➪Hide Browser to hide it.
iTunes displays a playlist as a song list in the List pane, even if it includes 
other content items. The column headings for playlists have different mean-
ings for the following types of content:
 
 Songs and music videos: The Name is the title of the song; the Artist is 
the band, artist, or performer. The Album is the title of the CD or vinyl 
record on which the song appeared. For music videos, the Name is typi-
cally the title of a song in the music video.
 
 Podcasts: The Name is the title of the podcast episode (as in “Ballad 
Roots of California Folk-Rock”), the Artist is the name of the podcast 
author (as in Tony Bove) or producer (such as Chicago Public Radio), 
and the Album is the name of the podcast (as in Rockument).
 
 Audio books: The Album is typically the book’s title (as in Fear and 
Loathing in Las Vegas), and the Name is typically the title of one of the 
parts (as in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas–Part 1 of 3).
 
 TV shows: The Name is the name of the TV show episode (as in “Mr. 
Monk and the Airplane”), the Artist is the name of the show (as in 
Monk), and the Album is the season (as in Monk, Season 1).
Understanding the content indicators
When you make choices in iTunes, it displays an action indicator next to 
each content item in List view — song, movie, TV show episode, music video, 
audio book, radio station, or podcast episode — to show you what it’s doing. 
Here’s a list of the indicators and their meanings:
 
 Orange waveform: iTunes is importing the item.
 
 Green check mark: iTunes finished importing the item.
 
 Exclamation point: iTunes can’t find the item.
 
 If you delete an item accidentally from your iTunes library, and even go 
as far as to click OK to put the item in the trash, you can still move the 
item back into iTunes by dragging its file from the system’s Trash Can 
directly back into the iTunes window. 
 
 Broadcast icon: The item is on the Internet and plays as a stream.

152
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
 Black check mark: The item is marked for the next operation, such as 
importing from an audio CD or playing in sequence.
 
 Click to remove the check mark.
 
 Speaker: The item (song, movie, episode, or whatever) is playing.
 
 Chasing arrows: iTunes is copying the content item from another loca-
tion or downloading it from the Internet.
Changing the List view options
iTunes lets you customize the List view in the List pane for each type of con-
tent. For music, the list starts out with the Name, Artist, Album, Track, Time, 
Genre, My Rating, Play Count, and Last Played categories. You might have 
to drag the horizontal scroll bar along the bottom of the song list to see all 
these columns. You can display more, less, or different information in your 
song list.
Customize your List view in the following ways:
 
 Make a column wider or narrower. While you move your cursor over 
the divider between two columns, the cursor changes to a vertical bar 
with opposing arrows extending left and right; you can click and drag 
the divider to change the column’s width.
 
 Change the order of columns. Click a column heading and drag the 
entire column to the left or right.
 
 You can’t change the position of the Name column and the narrow 
column to its left, which displays indicators and shows the playlist 
order.
 
 Add or remove columns. All columns except Name and the playlist 
order can be added or removed:
 
a. Select the type of content in the Source pane in the Library sec-
tion (Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks, Radio, or 
Ringtones), and choose View➪View Options.
 
b. Select the columns that you want to appear in the list from the 
View Options dialog (as shown in Figure 8-5).
You can also change the view options by Ctrl-clicking (on a Mac)or right-
clicking (on Windows) any column heading in the list in either Browse view 
or List view.
 
Enabling the Kind column in the View Options dialog can help you keep track 
of different kinds of files, such as songs encoded as AIFF, AAC, or MP3 or 
videos encoded in QuickTime or MPEG.

Sorting Content by the List View Options
With just a little know-how, you can use the List view options to sort the list-
ing of content items. You can sort items not only by name or album but also 
by composer, the date the items were added to the library, or other informa-
tion that you can add to an item (as I describe in Chapter 9).
At the very least, you can sort the content by the column headings you now 
use in the List view. You can also add other column headings to your List 
view (as I describe in the earlier section, “Changing the List view options”) 
and sort with them.
For example, clicking the Time heading reorders the items by their duration 
in ascending order, from shortest to longest. If you click the Time heading 
again, the sort is in descending order, which is reversed, starting with the lon-
gest item. You can sort by any column heading, such as Artist, Album, Track, 
Date Added, and Ratings.
You can tell whether the sort is in ascending or descending order by the 
little arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow points up, the sort is in 
ascending order; when pointing down, it’s in descending order.
 
Alternatively, you can sort the list in alphabetical order. Click the Artist head-
ing to sort the items in the list by artist name in alphabetical order (arrow 
pointing up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alphabetical order (arrow 
pointing down).

154
Part II: Managing Your Media 
iTunes also lets you sort the song list via the Album column. Each time you 
click Album, the heading cycles through each of the following options:
 
 Album, which sorts alphabetically by album title.
 
 Album by Artist, which groups albums by artist and then lists them 
alphabetically.
 
 Album by Year, which groups albums by artist and then lists them 
chronologically by year (set in the Song Information dialog).
iTunes keeps track of the songs, audio books, and podcasts you skip — not 
to be polite, just to be useful. You can use this feature to sort the Music and 
Audiobooks lists of your library in List view, thereby making it easier to 
select and delete the items you skip. 
Searching for Content
Because your iTunes library will most likely grow, you might find the usual 
browsing and scrolling methods that I describe earlier in this chapter too 
time-consuming. Let iTunes find your content for you!
 
If you want to search the entire library with the browser open in List view, 
select All at the top of the Genre and Artist columns to browse the entire 
library before typing a term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, choose 
View➪Hide Browser to show the List view without the browser.
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the top-right corner — and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click in the Search field and enter several characters of your search 
term.
 
 Use these tips for successful searching:
 
• Specify your search with a specific title, artist, or album.
 
• Narrow your search by typing more characters. Using fewer charac-
ters results in a longer list of possible songs.
 
• Case doesn’t matter, nor do whole words. The Search feature ignores 
case. For example, when I search for miles, iTunes finds a long list 
that includes “Eight Miles High,” “Forty Miles of Bad Road,” and 
“She Smiles like a River,” as well as everything by Miles Davis.
 
2. Look through the results, which display while you type.
 
 The search operation works immediately, as shown in Figure 8-6, dis-
playing any matches in the Name, Artist, and Album columns.

155
 Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
 
Figure 8-6: 
Search for 
anything by 
typing any 
part of the 
name, artist, 
album, or 
title.
 
 
3. Scroll through the search results and then click an item to select it.
To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either 
click the circled X in the Search field (which appears after you start typing 
characters) or delete what you typed. You then see the entire list in the List 
pane, just like before you began your search. All the items are still there and 
remain there unless you explicitly remove them. Searching manipulates only 
your view of the items.
Finding the Content’s Media File
Getting lost in a large library is easy. While you browse your library, you 
might want to return quickly to view the current item playing. While your file 
plays, choose View➪Show Current Song (or press Ô-L on a Mac or Ctrl-L in 
Windows as a shortcut). iTunes shows you the item that’s playing.
You can also show the location of the media file for any content item. This 
trick comes in handy when you want to open the media file’s folder. On a 
Mac, choose File➪Show in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows, choose File➪
Show in Windows Explorer (or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives control to the 
operating system (Mac or Windows), which displays the folder containing 
the media file.

156
Part II: Managing Your Media 
You can show the file location if it’s on your hard drive, but not if it’s in a 
shared library on another computer. See Chapter 12 for more details on look-
ing for media files.
Showing Duplicate Items
Because your library will grow, you’ll probably want to check for duplica-
tions. Some songs that appear on artist CDs also appear on compilation or 
soundtrack CDs. If you rip them all, you could have duplicate songs that 
take up space on your hard drive. You might even have duplicate videos and 
audio books.
On the other hand, maybe you want to find different versions of the same 
song by the same artist. Even when the songs appear on different albums, 
iTunes can quickly find all the songs with the same title by the same artist.
To show duplicate items in the list, choose File➪Show Duplicates. iTunes dis-
plays all the duplicate items in the List pane in the order of the last sort. (For 
example, if you last sorted by Album, the items appear in Album order.) If 
you’re using the browser in List view, you see all the duplicate items in artist 
order. Click the artist to see the duplicate items specifically for that artist.
To stop showing duplicate items and return to your previous view, click the 
Show All button below the list of duplicates.
Deleting Content
Deleting content might seem counterproductive when you’re trying to build 
up your iTunes library, but sometimes you just have to do it. For example, 
you want to delete the following:
 
 Versions of songs: You might have ripped a CD twice — say, once in AIFF 
format to burn the songs onto another CD and once in AAC format for 
your library and iPod or iPhone. You can delete the AIFF versions in your 
library after burning your CD (see Chapter 12 for burning instructions).
 
 Songs from playlists: You can delete songs from playlists yet keep the 
songs in your library. When you delete a song from a playlist, the song 
is simply deleted from the list — not from the library. You can delete 
entire playlists as well without harming the songs in the library. You 

157
 Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
have to select a media category in the Library section in the Source pane 
first, in order to delete songs from the library. (See Chapter 10 for more 
information about playlists.)
 
 Any podcast, video, song, or audio book album, or artist from the 
library:
 
• Podcasts: Select Podcasts in the Library section of the Source pane 
and then select any podcast or podcast episodes. Press Delete/
Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete) to delete them. If you delete 
the podcast, you remove it from your library, and you have to re-
subscribe to it to get it back. If you delete an episode, you can get 
it back by clicking the Get button next to the episode. You can also 
select a single podcast episode and then choose Edit➪Delete All to 
delete all episodes but keep the podcast itself.
 
• Movies or TV shows: Select Movies or TV Shows in the Library 
section of the Source pane and then select any movie or TV 
show episodes or seasons. Press Delete/Backspace (or choose 
Edit➪Delete). You can also select a single TV show episode and 
then choose Edit➪Delete All to delete all episodes.
 
• Audio books: Select Audiobooks in the Library section of the 
Source pane and then select any book section or all the sections of 
a book (books are typically divided into multiple sections). Press 
Delete/Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete).
 
• Songs (individually, or albums, or artists) or music videos: Select 
Music in the Library section of the Source pane and then select 
the item or items — which can be on or more songs, an entire 
album, all the works of an artist, or a selection of albums or artists. 
For example, you can select an album in the browser in List view 
to automatically select all the songs on the album. Press Delete/
Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete).
 
Deleting a content item from the iTunes library removes the item from your 
library, but it doesn’t remove it from your hard drive until you agree.
In the first warning dialog that appears, click Remove to remove the selected 
items from the library, or click Cancel.
iTunes then displays a second warning about moving the files that are still in 
the iTunes Music folder to the Trash (Mac) or Recycle Bin (Windows). You 
can click Move to Trash on a Mac, or Move to Recycle Bin in Windows, to 
trash the item. Click Keep File to keep it in your music folder, or click Cancel 
to cancel the operation.

158
Part II: Managing Your Media 
If you choose to move the album or artist folder to the Trash or Recycle 
Bin, the album or artist folder is deleted from your hard drive; otherwise, it 
remains in your iTunes Music folder.
 
If you leave music files and folders in your iTunes Music folder, you can add 
them back to your iTunes library by dragging and dropping them into the 
iTunes window.
 
You can delete multiple items in one clean sweep. Press Shift while you click a 
range of items. Alternatively, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) when you click 
individual items to add them to the selection. Then press Delete/Backspace 
(or choose Edit➪Delete).

Adding and Editing Information 
in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Retrieving information online
 Editing information for each content item
 Adding information, cover art, comments, and ratings
O
rganization depends on information. You expect your computer to do a 
lot more than just store a song with Track 01 as the only identifier. Not 
only can iTunes retrieve the song’s track information from the Internet, but it 
can also find the cover art for you.
Adding all the information for your iTunes content seems like a lot of trouble, 
but you can get most of the information automatically from the Internet — 
and without all that pesky typing. Adding track information is important 
because you certainly don’t want to mistakenly play Frank Zappa’s “My 
Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama” when trying to impress your classical music 
teacher with the third movement of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony, do 
you? And because videos you make yourself or convert from other sources 
don’t have this automatic information, you have to enter some description to 
tell them apart.
This chapter shows you how to add information to your content library in 
iTunes and edit it for better viewing so that you can organize your content 
by artist, album name, genre, composer, and ratings. You can then use 
this information to sort in List view by clicking the column headings. This 
chapter also describes how to add cover art for navigating your library 
with Cover Flow.

160
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Retrieving Song Information 
from the Internet
Why bother entering information if someone else has already done it for you? 
You can easily get information about most music CDs from the Internet (that 
is, assuming you can connect to the Internet). The online database available 
for iTunes users holds information for millions of songs on commercial CDs 
and even some bootleg CDs.
Retrieving information automatically
When you pop a commercial music CD into your computer running iTunes, 
iTunes automatically looks up the track information for that CD on the 
Internet and fills in the information fields (name, artist, album, and so on). 
You don’t need to do anything to make this happen. You can also edit the 
information after iTunes fills in the fields.
If your computer doesn’t access the Internet automatically, you might want 
to turn off this automatic information retrieval. (You can always retrieve 
the information manually, as I describe later in this section.) To turn off the 
retrieval of track information, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog appears with buttons along the top.
 
2. Click the General button.
 
 The General preferences appear.
 
3. Deselect the Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet 
option.
 
 With this option turned on, iTunes connects to the Internet automatically 
and retrieves the track information. When turned off, iTunes doesn’t 
retrieve the information, but you can retrieve it manually, as I describe 
in the next section.
Retrieving information manually
You can connect manually to the Internet at any time (for example, by using a 
modem connection) and retrieve the song information when you’re ready to use 
it. After you connect to the Internet, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.

161
 Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Entering Content Information
You have to enter the information for certain media, including CDs that aren’t 
known by the Gracenote CDDB, custom CD-Rs, and videos and audio books 
that you bring into iTunes from sources other than the iTunes Store. No big 
deal, though; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click directly in the information field (such as Artist) in List view.
 
2. Click again so that the mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor.
 
3. Type text directly into the information field.
 
After grabbing the song information from the Internet or typing it, iTunes 
keeps track of the information for the CD even if you just play the CD without 
importing it. The next time you insert the CD, the song information is 
automatically filled in.
Using the Gracenote database
The first time I popped a commercial music CD 
into a computer, song information appeared 
like magic. iTunes automatically displayed the 
song names, album title, and artist names. How 
did it know? This information isn’t stored on a 
standard music CD in digital form, but iTunes 
has to recognize the disc somehow.
The magic is that the software knows how 
to reach out and find the information on the 
Internet — in the Gracenote CDDB service. 
CDDB stands for (you guessed it) CD Database. 
The site (www.gracenote.com) hosts 
CDDB on the Web and searches for music CDs 
by artist, song title, and other methods. The 
iTunes software already knows how to use this 
database so you don’t have to!
Gracenote recognizes an audio CD by taking 
into account the number, sequence, and 
duration of tracks. (This is how the database 
recognizes CD-Rs that are burned with the 
identical songs in the same order.) The data-
base keeps track of information for most of the 
music CDs that you find on the market.
The database doesn’t contain any information 
about personal or custom CDs unless people 
submit information to the database about 
such CDs. You can submit information about 
your personal or custom CDs by using iTunes: 
Type the information for each track while the 
audio CD is in your computer and then choose 
Advanced➪Submit CD Track Names. The infor-
mation that you enter is sent to the Gracenote 
CDDB site, where the good people who work 
tirelessly on the database check out your infor-
mation before including it. In fact, if you spot a 
typo or something erroneous in the information 
that you receive from the Gracenote CDDB, you 
can easily correct it. Just use the Submit CD 
Track Names command to send the corrected 
version back to the Gracenote site. The good 
folks at Gracenote appreciate the effort.

162
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Editing the Information
Retrieving ready-made song information from the Internet is a great help, 
but you might not always like the format it comes in. Maybe you want to edit 
artist and band names or other information the way I do — I like to list solo 
artists by last name rather than by first name. (Gracenote CDDB lists artists 
by first name.) For example, I routinely change Miles Davis to Davis, Miles.
Other annoyances sometimes occur when bands feature The at the beginning 
of their names, such as The Who, The Band, The Beatles, and The Beach 
Boys. Even though these names sort correctly (in alphabetical order, under 
their proper names), I dislike having The before the band name, so I routinely 
remove it.
You might also want to change the information that is supplied by the iTunes 
Store for the movies, TV shows, music videos, audio books, and podcasts 
you download. And if you obtain your content from other sources, you might 
need to add information for the first time.
In List view, you can edit the content information by clicking directly in the 
specific track’s field (such as the Artist field) and then clicking again so that 
the mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor. You can then select the text 
and type over it — or use the Copy, Cut, and Paste commands on the Edit 
menu — to move tiny bits of text around within the field. As you can see in 
Figure 9-1, I changed the Artist field to Beck, Jeff.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Click inside 
a field to 
edit the 
information.
 
You can edit the Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and My Ratings fields in the list. 
However, editing this information by choosing File➪Get Info is easier. Keep 
reading to find out why.

163
 Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Editing multiple items at once
Editing in the content list is fine if you’re editing the information for one 
item, but typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For 
example, if a CD of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, 
you might want to change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all 
the information in one fell swoop is fast and clean, but like most powerful 
shortcuts, you need to be careful because it can be dangerous.
You can change a group of items in List view. Follow these steps to change a 
group of items at once:
 
1. Select a group of content items by clicking the first item and then 
pressing Shift while you click the last item.
 
 All the items between the first and last are highlighted. You can extend a 
selection by Shift-clicking other items or add to a selection by Ô-clicking 
(Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows). You can also remove items already 
selected by Ô-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows).
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (Windows).
 
 A warning message displays:
Are you sure you want to edit information for multiple 
items?
 
 Speed-editing the information in multiple items at once can be dangerous 
for your library organization. If, for example, you change an informational 
snippet for one item in a selected group (the song or movie title, for 
example), the corresponding snippet for all items in the selected group 
are going to change as well! Be careful about what you edit when using 
this method.
 
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
 
 The Multiple Item Information dialog appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
4. Edit the field(s) you want to change for all the items.
 
 When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the check 
box next to the field. iTunes assumes that you want that field changed 
in all the selected items. Make sure that no other check box is selected 
except the one for the field that you want.
 
5. Click OK to make the change.
 
 iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of items.

164
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
Figure 9-2:

iTunes offers both Artist and Album Artist fields for a song, so that you can 
include the album artist if it’s different — such as the artist names for a duet 
album or a compilation album that features songs by different artists (such as 
Eric Clapton’s Crossroads box set, in which the Album Artist is Clapton, but the 
Artist for each song might be the Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith, and so on). You 
can also use this field for Artist name formatted differently; for example, the 
Artist field could have the artist as “Bob Dylan” and the Album Artist as “Dylan, 
Bob.” You can then change the list view options (as I describe in Chapter 8) to 
include the Album Artist field as a column for sorting the song list.
Editing fields for a single item
Although the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for 
identifying a song in your iTunes library, some facts — such as composer 
credits — might not be included. Adding composer credits is usually worth 
your effort because you can then search and sort by composer and create 
playlists based on the composer. Videos (movies, TV shows, and music 
videos), podcasts, and audio books might also have information in their 
fields that you want to change or have blank fields that could use some 
helpful information.
To get all the details about an item — song, video, podcast, or audio book — 
select the item and then choose File➪Get Info (or press Ô-I on a Mac or Ctrl-I 
in Windows). You see the item’s information dialog, as shown in Figure 9-3.

size, and the digital compression method (bit rate, sample rate, and so on).
 
 Info: The Info tab allows you to change the name, artist, composer, album, 
genre, year, and other information. You can also add comments, as shown 
in Figure 9-4.
 
 Video: The Video tab lets you set the type of video — movie, TV show, or 
music video — in the Kind pop-up menu. For TV shows, you can add show 
information, including the title of the show, episode number and ID, and 
season number.
 
 Sorting: The Sorting tab allows you to add information to fields for 
additional choices while sorting your library content. For example, you can 
add a different name for the artist in the Sort Artist field to the right of the 
Artist field, such as “Dylan, Bob” for “Bob Dylan.” Information from the Info 
tab appears on the left side, and you can add an alternative sort field on the 
right side. You can even add a Show field for the title of a concert or some 
other use. Choose View➪View Options to select a sort field as a List view 
option, and then you can sort your content in List view by using the sort 
fields.

 Options: The Options tab, as shown in Figure 9-5, offers the following:
 
• Volume Adjustment: You can set the volume for a song, video, 
podcast, or audio book in advance so that it always plays at 
that volume (or lower, if your overall iTunes or iPod volume is 
set lower). Drag the slider to the right to increase the volume 
adjustment up to 100% (twice the usual volume); drag the slider 
to the left to decrease the volume adjustment down to –100% 
(half the usual volume). For more details on setting the volume 
in advance, see Chapter 13.
 
• Equalizer Preset: Choose an equalizer preset for an item. See 
Chapter 13 for details on how you can use this preset to control 
how an item sounds on your iPod as well as in iTunes.
 
• Media Kind: You can assign a different media type to the item so 
that it appears in a different part of your iTunes library. For exam-
ple, you can assign the audiobook type to a sound file that appears 
as a music file.
 
• Ratings: Assign up to five stars to an item as a rating. (See how in 
the upcoming section, “Adding a rating.”)
 
• Start Time and Stop Time: Set the start and stop times for an item. 
You can use these options to cut unwanted intros and outros of a 
song (such as announcers, audience applause, and tuning up), or 
to skip opening credits or commercials of movies. You can also

 Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
use it to split an item (or, in the parlance of record label executives 
and artists, split a track) into multiple items (tracks). 
 
 Visit this book’s companion Web site for details.
 
• Remember Playback Position: Set this option for an item so that 
when you select and play the item, iTunes resumes playing it from 
where you left off. This option is usually turned on for audio books, 
movies, and TV shows.
 
• Skip When Shuffling: Set this option for an item to be skipped from 
Party Shuffle.
 
• Part of a Gapless Album: Set this option for an item to be played 
back without a gap between songs. (See Chapter 5 to find out 
about the gaps between songs.)
 
 Lyrics: The Lyrics tab offers a text field for adding text.
 
 You can view lyrics on iPod touch/classic/nano, older color-display 
models, and iPhone and by starting a song (or choosing the Now Playing 
option from the main menu) and then tapping the album cover on an 
iPod touch or iPhone, or pressing the Select button three or four times. 
(The first click shows the slider, the second shows the cover art if there 
is cover art, the third click shows ratings you’ve entered, and the fourth 
shows the lyrics.) If you press the Select button too many times, the 
iPod returns to the Now Playing display.
 
 Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the 
item. See the upcoming section, “Adding Cover Art.”

Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
If you follow the careers of certain guitarists, vocalists, or session musicians, 
you can sort your music in List view by something other than the given artist 
for the album. First, provide a new entry for the Sort Artist or Sort Album 
Artist fields in the Sorting tab, and then choose that field as a view option so 
that you can sort on it. For example, I like to use the Sort Artist field for the 
leader, lead guitarist, or lead singer in a band; or a session player or special 
guest (such as Nicky Hopkins, who played keyboards on a variety of albums 
by different bands including The Who, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles). 
After entering Nicky Hopkins into the Sort Artist field for the songs, I can 
choose View➪View Options and select Sort Artist for a column heading. I 
can then sort the List view by clicking the new Sort Artist heading to find all 
recordings featuring Nicky Hopkins.
You can apply the entry of a sort field in the Sorting tab to all the tracks of 
the same album or to all tracks by the same artist, album artist, composer, 
or show. After changing the sort field for an item in the Sorting tab, select the 
item in List view, Control-click (right-click in Windows) the item to display 
the contextual menu, and then choose Apply Sort Field. Click Yes to make the 
change.
 
To move through an album one item at a time when using Get Info (without 
closing and reopening the information dialog), click the Previous or Next 
buttons in the bottom-left corner of the dialog.
Adding a rating
iTunes allows you to rate your content. The cool thing about ratings is that 
they’re yours. You can use ratings to mean anything you want. For example, 
you can rate songs based on how much you like them, whether your mother 
would listen to them, or how they blend into a work environment. You can 
also rate videos based on your watching habits, as well as audio books and 
podcasts.
To add a rating to a content item, click the Options tab (refer to Figure 9-5) 
and drag inside the My Rating field to add stars. The upper limit is five stars 
(for the best). You can also select the item and choose File➪Rating to assign 
a rating to an item.
You might have noticed the My Top Rated playlist in the Source pane. This 
playlist is an example of a smart playlist — a playlist that updates when ratings 
are changed. The My Top Rated playlist plays all the top-rated songs in your 
library. You can find out more about playlists in Chapter 10. 

169
 Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Adding Cover Art
iTunes displays the cover art for your albums, videos, movies, podcasts, audio 
books, and TV shows in the Cover Flow browser. (See Chapter 8 for details.) 
Color-display iPods, Apple TV, iPod touch, and the iPhone also display the 
cover art. So it makes sense to get the art, especially since it’s free!
Items that you buy from the iTunes Store typically include an image of the 
album, book, or box cover art or a photo of the artist that serves as cover 
art. You can see the artwork in the artwork viewer in the lower-left corner of 
the iTunes window by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button, as shown in 
Figure 9-6. The artwork changes for each item or album that you select or play. 
You can toggle between displaying the cover art of the item playing to the cover 
art of a selected item by clicking the right arrow (or the words “Now Playing”) 
above the artwork viewer. Toggle back to displaying the cover art of the now-
playing item by clicking the right arrow again (or the words “Selected Item”).
 
Figure 9-6: 
Show the 
artwork for 
a song’s 
album.
 Show/Hide Artwork button
To fill your library automatically with cover art for the CDs you ripped, get your-
self an iTunes Store account if you don’t already have one. Log in to your account 
and then choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the cover art not 
only for iTunes Store purchases but also for CDs you ripped — provided that the 
albums are also available in the iTunes Store.
 
To download cover art for ripped CDs automatically after ripping them (without 
having to manually choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork each time), choose 
Preferences from the iTunes menu on a Mac or the Edit menu in Windows, click 
the Store tab, and select the Automatically Download Missing Album Artwork 
option.

170
Part II: Managing Your Media 
You can also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs, such as 
Amazon.com, or you can even scan them from the actual CDs. The optimal 
size for cover art is 300 x 300 pixels. Save it in a graphics format that iTunes 
(and its underlying graphics technology, QuickTime) understands — JPEG, 
GIF, PNG, TIFF, or Photoshop. With a Web browser, you can visit Web pages 
to scout for suitable art; just Control-click (Mac) or right-click an image 
(Windows) to download and save the image on your hard drive.
To add artwork to one or more items, select it (or them) in your iTunes 
library and do one of the following:
 
 Drag the artwork’s image file from a folder on your hard drive into 
the artwork viewer (the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window).
 
 To add artwork for an entire album (rather than just individual songs) 
or season of TV shows, first select the album or season in the browser 
in List view, or select all the items individually. Then drag the image file 
into the artwork viewer.
 
 Add artwork to a single item through the information window.
 
 Choose File➪Get Info and then click the Artwork tab in the Get Info 
dialog. Click the Add button, browse your hard drive or network for the 
image file, select the file, and then click OK.
 
 Add artwork for multiple items in the Multiple Item Information 
dialog.
 
 Choose File➪Get Info after selecting the items, enable the Artwork field 
(select its check box), and then drag a graphics file for the cover art 
from a Desktop folder to the Artwork well. Click Yes to the warning 
message to change the artwork.
 
 See the “Editing multiple items at once” section, earlier in this chapter, 
to find out more about using the Multiple Item Information dialog.
To remove the artwork from an item, view the artwork in a larger window or 
resize the artwork, choose File➪Get Info and then click the Artwork tab. You 
can add a different image (or several images) with the Add button, delete 
images with the Delete button, or resize images with the size slider.

Organizing iTunes Content 
with Playlists
In This Chapter
 Creating a playlist of songs and albums
 Adding podcast episodes and videos to playlists
 Creating and editing smart playlists
 Creating a Genius playlist 
 Creating an iMix playlist for the iTunes Store
T
he ability to play any set of songs in a specific order is one of the joys of 
using iTunes and iPods. A playlist is a list of the items that you want in 
the sequence that you want to play them. You can use playlists to organize 
your music playback experience. For example, you can make a playlist of love 
songs from different albums to play the next time you need a romantic mood, 
or you can compile a playlist of surf songs for a trip to the beach. 
You can also organize your content for different operations — such as copy-
ing to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV or burning a CD — by creating playlists. 
I create playlists that combine songs from different albums based on themes 
or similarities. For example, I have a jazz playlist for cruising around with 
my iPhone in the city at night, a classic rock playlist for jogging with my iPod 
shuffle in the morning and hanging out in coffee shops with my iPod nano, a 
playlist of short films mixed with TV shows for a long airplane ride with my 
iPod touch, and a playlist of rain songs to celebrate rainy days with any of 
these devices, including my Apple TV. 
You can create as many playlists of songs, audio books, podcast episodes, 
and videos as you want, in any order that you like. The items and their files 
don’t change, nor are they copied: iTunes simply creates a list of the item 
names with links to the actual items and their files.

172
Part II: Managing Your Media 
You can even create a smart playlist, which automatically includes items in 
the playlist based on the criteria you set up and also removes items that 
don’t match the criteria. The information included in iTunes (see Chapter 9) 
is very useful for setting up the criteria. For example, you can define the crite-
ria for a smart playlist to automatically include songs from a particular artist 
or songs that have the highest rating or fit within a particular musical genre.
Creating Playlists
You need to create a playlist to burn a CD, but playlists can also make it 
easier to play items you like without searching the entire library for them. 
You can create playlists of individual songs or entire albums. You can also 
include audio books, TV shows, videos, podcast episodes, and Web radio sta-
tions in playlists.
Song playlists
You can drag individual songs into a playlist and rearrange the songs to play 
in any sequence you want.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Add Playlist button (in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes 
window under the Source pane) or choose File➪New Playlist.
 
 This step creates a new, untitled playlist in the Playlists section of the 
Source pane named, appropriately enough, untitled playlist, highlighted 
and ready to rename. 
 
2. Give the playlist a new descriptive name.
 
 You can begin typing a new name and press Return (or just click some-
where else) to save the name. (If the playlist name wasn’t highlighted 
first, click once to select it, click the name again so that the text cursor 
appears, and the playlist name is highlighted and ready for you to type 
the new name.) 
 
 After you type the new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alpha-
betical order in the Playlists section of the Source pane (underneath the 
preset smart playlists). 
 
3. Select Music in the Library section of the Source pane and then drag 
songs from the library to the playlist.
 
 Drag one song at a time or drag a group of songs, dropping them onto 
the playlist name in the Source pane. The initial order of songs in the 
playlist is based on the order in which you drag them to the list. 

173
 Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
 
4. Select the playlist in the Playlists section of the Source pane to play it.
 
 After selecting a playlist, the songs in the playlist appear in the List 
pane. Select any song in the playlist to start playing from that song to 
the end of the playlist, and click the Play button.
To rearrange the list of songs in the playlist, see “Rearranging and managing 
playlists” later in this chapter.
To open a playlist in a new window, double-click the icon next to the playlist 
name in the Source pane. You can then select Music in the Source pane to 
browse your music library, and drag items from your music library to the 
separate playlist window.
 
To create a playlist quickly, select the group of songs in the List pane that you 
want to make into a playlist. Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection, or drag 
the selection to an area between playlists in the Source pane. You can then 
type a name for the new playlist that appears.
Album playlists
Making a playlist of an album is simple. Select the Music option in the Library 
section of the Source pane, select List view by choosing View➪As List and 
then show the browser by choosing View➪Show Browser, and finally drag 
an album from the Album list to an area between playlists in the Playlists 
section of the Source pane. Or, select the album and then choose File➪New 
Playlist from Selection. iTunes automatically creates a new playlist named 
after the album.
You might want to play several albums back to back without having to select 
each album to play it. For example, you might want to use an iPod on that 
long drive from London to Liverpool to play The Beatles’ albums in the order 
they were released (or perhaps in the reverse order, following The Beatles’ 
career from London back to Liverpool).
To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Create a new playlist.
 
 Create a playlist by clicking the Add Playlist button under the Source 
pane or by choosing File➪New Playlist.
 
 A new, untitled playlist appears in the Playlists section of the Source 
pane, highlighted and ready to rename.
 
2. In the Playlists section of the Source pane, give the playlist a new, 
descriptive name.

174
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
3. Select the Music option in the Library section of the Source pane, and 
click the leftmost View button in the upper-right corner of the iTunes 
window to view as list (or choose View➪As List).
 
 The List pane displays a list of all the songs.
 
4. Choose View➪Show Browser, then find and click the name of the 
artist who created the album you’re seeking.
 
 After clicking the artist name, the Album list for that artist appears in 
the right panel.
 
5. Drag an album name from the right panel over to the playlist name in 
the Source pane.
 
6. Select and drag each subsequent album over the playlist name.
 
 Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists the songs in the 
proper track sequence for each album. The albums are listed in the play-
list in the order that you dragged them.
Podcast playlists
You can add one or more podcast episodes to your playlists, or add all the 
episodes of a podcast at once. You can even create a playlist consisting 
entirely of episodes from different podcasts.
To add one or more podcast episodes to a playlist, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Add Playlist button or choose File➪New Playlist.
 
 The Add Playlist button is in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes 
window under the Source pane.
 
 A new, untitled playlist appears in the Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
2. In the Playlists section of the Source pane, click the untitled playlist 
twice and give it a new descriptive name.
 
 After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the Playlists section of the Source pane, underneath the 
preset smart playlists.
 
3. Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane and then open a podcast 
by clicking the triangle next to its name.
 
 The podcast opens to reveal its episodes. (See Chapter 6 for details on 
opening podcasts and playing podcast episodes.)
 
4. Drag episodes from the Podcasts list to the playlist.
 
 You can drag one episode at a time, or drag a selection of episodes, and 
then drop them onto the playlist name in the Playlists section of the 
Source pane. The initial order of episodes in the playlist is based on the 
order in which you drag the episodes to the list. 

175
 Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
Of course, you can rearrange the episodes in any order after dragging them, 
as I show you in “Rearranging and managing playlists” later in this chapter.
You can also add all of the podcast episodes to a playlist. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new playlist by following Steps 1 and 2 of the preceding list.
 
 You know, you might as well memorize those two steps so that you can 
do them in your sleep.
 
2. Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane and then select a pod-
cast by name.
 
3. Drag the podcast name over the playlist name.
 
 iTunes adds all of the podcast episodes to the playlist. The initial order of 
episodes in the playlist is based on the podcast order. Of course, you can 
rearrange the episodes in the playlist in any order after dragging them.
 
To create a playlist with all of a podcast’s episodes quickly, choose Podcasts 
in the Source pane and select the podcast that you want to make into a play-
list. Then choose File➪New Playlist from Selection or drag the selection to 
an area between playlists in the Playlists section of the Source pane. You can 
then type a name for the new playlist that appears.
Video playlists
You can drag individual videos and TV shows into a playlist and rearrange 
them to play in any sequence you want.
To create a video playlist, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Add Playlist button or choose File➪New Playlist.
 
 Clicking the Add Playlist button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes 
window under the Source pane, creates a new, untitled playlist in the 
Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
2. In the Playlists section of the Source pane, click the untitled playlist 
twice and give it a new descriptive name.
 
 After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the Playlists section of the Source pane, underneath the 
preset smart playlists.
 
3. Select the Movies or TV Shows option in the Source pane and then 
drag videos from the library to the playlist.
 
 Drag one video at a time or drag a selection of items, dropping them 
onto the playlist name in the Playlists section of the Source pane. The 
initial order of videos (movies, TV show episodes, or music videos) in 
the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them to the list.

176
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Of course, you can rearrange these videos in any order after dragging them, 
as I show you in “Rearranging and managing playlists” later in this chapter.
You can mix videos with songs and other items in a playlist. For example, 
mixing songs and music videos; songs and a video documentary; or just 
a selection of TV shows, music, podcasts, movies, and audio books for an 
entire day’s worth of entertainment. However, if you transfer the playlist to 
an iPod that doesn’t play video, the iPod skips the videos.
Rearranging and managing playlists
To rearrange the items in a playlist, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the playlist in the Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
 After selecting a playlist, the songs in the playlist appear in the List pane. 
 
2. Drag items in the List pane to rearrange the list.
 
• To move an item (such as a song) up the list and scroll at the same 
time, drag it over the up arrow in the first column.
 
• To move an item down the list and scroll, drag it to the bottom of 
the list.
 
• To move a group of items at once, press Shift and select a range of 
items (or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows while clicking to 
select specific songs) and then drag them into a new position. 
 
 Besides dragging items, you can also rearrange a playlist by sorting it: 
Just click one of the column headings, such as Name, Time, or Artist.
 
You can drag items from one playlist to another. Only links are copied, not the 
actual files. 
You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking its name twice and typing a 
new one. Also, in case you forget which songs are in which playlists, you can 
see all the playlists that include a particular song. In List view, press Control 
on a Mac and click the song; in Windows, right-click the song and choose 
Show in Playlist from the contextual menu. The playlists that include the 
song are listed in the submenu.
 
You can organize playlists into folders in the Source pane. Choose File➪New 
Playlist Folder to create a folder in the Playlists section. Then drag playlist 
names and drop them over the new folder — just like how you treat files and 
folders in your operating system. Folders are useful for grouping playlists that 
are similar in content or function. For example, I created a different folder cor-
responding to each of my iPods to organize the playlists I use to synchronize 
with those iPods. (See Chapter 11 to read about iPod synchronization.) You 
can include smart playlists in folders as well as regular playlists.

177
 Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
Deleting items from a playlist
You can delete items from playlists while keeping the items in your library. 
When you delete an item from a playlist, the item is simply deleted from the 
list — not from the library. You can also delete entire playlists without harm-
ing the content in the library. Note: You’ll need to switch to the Library sec-
tion of the Source pane (Music, Movies, TV Shows, and so on) if you want to 
delete items permanently from your library.
To delete an item from a playlist, select the playlist in the Playlists section of 
the Source pane and then select the item. Press Delete/Backspace or choose 
Edit➪Delete. In the warning dialog that appears, click Remove to remove the 
selected item from the list.
 
The one way you can completely delete an item from your library from within 
a playlist is by selecting the item and pressing Ô-Option-Delete (Mac) or Ctrl-
Alt-Backspace (Windows).
To delete a whole playlist, select the playlist in the Playlists section of the 
Source pane and then press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
Using Smart Playlists
Under Party Shuffle (near the top of the Playlists section of the Source pane), 
you can find smart playlists, which are indicated by a gear-in-a-document 
icon. iTunes comes with a few sample smart playlists, such as My Top Rated 
and Recently Added, and you can create your own. Smart playlists add items 
to themselves based on prearranged criteria, or rules. For example, when 
you rate your content items, My Top Rated changes to reflect your new rat-
ings. You don’t have to set up anything because My Top Rated and Recently 
Added are already defined for you.
Of course, smart playlists are ignorant of your taste in music or video. You 
have to program them with rules by using the information in iTunes (see 
Chapter 9). For example, you can create a smart playlist that uses the Year 
field to grab all the songs from 1966. This list, in no particular order, might 
include The Beatles (“Eleanor Rigby”), Frank Sinatra (“Strangers in the 
Night”), The Yardbirds (“Over Under Sideways Down”), and Ike and Tina 
Turner (“River Deep, Mountain High”) — a far-out playlist, no doubt, but not 
necessarily what you want. You can use other fields of information that you 
entered (such as ratings, artist name, or composer) to fine-tune your criteria. 
You can also use built-in functions, such as Play Count (the number of times 
the item was played) or Date Added (the date the item was added to the 
library).

178
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart 
Playlist dialog appears (as shown in Figure 10-1), offering the following 
choices for setting criteria:
 
Figure 10-1: 
Set the first 
match rule 
for a smart 
playlist.
 
 
 Match the Following Rule: From the first pop-up menu (refer to Figure 
10-1), you can choose any of the categories used for information, such 
as Artist, Composer, or Last Played. From the second pop-up menu, you 
can choose an operator, such as the greater-than or less-than operator. 
The selections that you make in these two pop-up menus combine to 
create a rule, such as Year is greater than 1966 or, as in Figure 
10-1, Composer contains (the words) Woody Guthrie. 
 
 You can also add multiple conditions by clicking the + button (on the 
right) as shown in Figure 10-2. You then decide whether to match all or 
any of these conditions. The Match xx of the Following Rules option is 
enabled by default when you set one or more rules.
 
 Limit To: You can limit the smart playlist to a specific duration, mea-
sured by the number of songs (items), time, or size in megabytes or giga-
bytes, as shown in Figure 10-2. You can have items selected by various 
methods, such as random, most recently played, and so on.
A smart playlist for recent additions
Setting up rules gives you the opportunity to 
create playlists that are smarter than the ones 
supplied with iTunes. For example, I created a 
smart playlist with criteria (as shown in Figure 
10-2) that does the following:
  Includes any item added to the library in 
the past week that also has a rating greater 
than three stars.
  Limits the playlist to 72 minutes to be sure it 
fits on a 74-minute audio CD, even with gaps 
between the songs. It also refines the selec-
tion to the most recently added if the entire 
selection becomes greater than 72 minutes.
  Matches only selected items.
  Performs live updating.

179
 Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
 
 Match Only Checked Items: This option selects only those songs or 
other items in the library that have a check mark beside them, along 
with the rest of the criteria. Selecting and deselecting items is an easy 
way to fine-tune your selection for a smart playlist.
 
 Live Updating: This allows iTunes to continually update the playlist 
while you play items, add or remove items from the library, change their 
ratings, and so on.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Use multiple 
conditions 
and a time 
limit for 
a smart 
playlist.
 
After setting up the rules, click OK. iTunes creates the playlist, noted by a 
gear-in-a-document icon and the name untitled playlist (or whatever phrase 
you used for the first condition, such as the album or artist name). You can 
click in the playlist field and then type a new name for it.
Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist, select it from the Playlists section of the Source pane 
and choose File➪Edit Smart Playlist. Or, you can Control-click (Mac) or right-
click (Windows) the playlist and then choose Edit Smart Playlist from the 
pop-up menu. Either way, the Smart Playlist window appears with the criteria 
for the smart playlist.
For example, to modify the smart playlist so that items with a higher rating 
are picked, simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria.
 
You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of items selected 
by various methods, such as random, most recently played, and so on.
Using the Genius Button
If you select a song and click the Genius button, iTunes takes a look at your 
selection and creates a playlist of songs that go along with it. That’s genius!

180
Part II: Managing Your Media 
The Genius button and the Genius sidebar (which I describe in glorious 
detail in Chapter 3) work with Apple’s iTunes Store content to match up your 
tastes to other iTunes users using a technique called collaborative filtering. 
The Genius feature analyzes the music in other people’s iTunes libraries — 
people who also have the same song you selected (if they use the Genius fea-
ture). All of this information is shared anonymously. The only music Genius 
knows, however, is the music available in the iTunes Store.
For the Genius feature to work, you need an iTunes Store account (see 
Chapter 4), and you must turn on Genius to enable iTunes to scan your music 
library and catalog your iTunes collection. The scanning process may take a 
few minutes or (for very large collections) a few hours, but you can continue 
using iTunes while it scans your music.
To turn on Genius, click the Turn on Genius button in the Genius sidebar 
enter your Apple ID and password for your iTunes Store account, and click 
Continue.
You can also turn on the Genius feature by choosing Store➪Turn On Genius, 
and turn if off by choosing Store➪Turn Off Genius. If you add new music, you 
can tell iTunes to immediately update the Genius feature with new informa-
tion by choosing Store➪Update Genius.
To create a genius playlist, select a song in the List pane and click the Genius 
button (the button with the atom icon) at the bottom right corner of the 
iTunes window. iTunes displays the genius playlist based on the selected 
song. You can set the limit of the number of songs for the genius playlist by 
clicking the Limit To pop-up menu in the top row of buttons on the right side 
of the List pane, as shown in Figure 10-3.
You can refresh the genius playlist with a new batch of songs based on the 
selected song by clicking the Refresh button in the top row of buttons (refer 
to Figure 10-3). When you refresh a genius playlist, you lose the previous ver-
sion of that playlist.
To save a genius playlist, click Save Playlist in the right corner of the top row 
of buttons. The playlist is saved with the genius icon using the name of the 
selected song and listed in the Playlists section of the Source pane at the top, 
above smart playlists. You can revisit this genius playlist and refresh it, or 
change its song limit. You can also rearrange the songs in the genius playlist 
by dragging them. To sort the songs, click the column headers in the List 
pane — just like other playlists.
You can synchronize your saved genius playlists with your iPod or iPhone 
(see Chapter 11 for details). Synchronized genius playlists on the iPod or 
iPhone contain the same songs that appeared in the iTunes version of the 
playlist. See Chapter 14 for details on using genius playlists with iPods and 
iPhones.

Creating an iMix
Amateur disk jockeys, rejoice! The iTunes Store offers the iMix section for 
sharing your iTunes playlists with other iTunes users. Anyone can find your 
iMix playlist by selecting the iTunes Store in the Source pane, choosing Music 
from the iTunes Store menu on the left panel at the top of the home page next 
to the new releases panel, and then clicking iMix in the More in Music menu 
on the left panel of the Music page.
Although you can submit a playlist of any items to be published in the iMix 
section of the store, only items available from the store are actually pub-
lished. Unavailable items are skipped.
Browsers in the iTunes Store can enter the iMix section and click any playlist 
to view it. See Chapter 4 for information about navigating the iTunes Store, 
playing short preview clips, and buying content.
To create an iMix, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the playlist in the Playlists section of the Source pane and 
choose Store➪Create an iMix.
 
 iTunes displays a warning dialog before accessing the iTunes Store to 
publish your playlist.

182

2. Click the Create button in the warning dialog.
 
 iTunes displays the iTunes Store sign-in dialog.
 
3. Enter your ID and password and then click Publish.
 
 iTunes selects the iTunes Store option in the Source pane and displays 
the iMix page. You see the iMix playlist that will be published, which 
includes only those items that are available from the store.
 
4. Edit the title and description for the iMix playlist and then click the 
Publish button.
iTunes publishes the playlist in the iMix section of the store. Others can 
browse the playlist and buy any items.

i
Tunes is the all-knowing, all-powerful synchronizer, the software you use 
to put content on your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV. Synchronizing your 
iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV with iTunes means keeping it up-to-date with your 
iTunes library. Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV mirrors as much of the 
content of your iTunes library as will fit, making assumptions if the entire 
library won’t fit. With iTunes, you can fill these devices very quickly and keep 
them synchronized every time you connect them. (iTunes can also keep your 
iPod or iPhone synchronized with contacts, calendars, and other personal 
info; see Chapter 19 for more info on that aspect of synchronization.)
iTunes lets you decide whether to copy only a portion of your content library 
or all your songs and audio books, photos, movies, TV shows, music videos, 
and podcasts. The choice is easy if your iTunes library and photo library 
together are small enough to fit in their entirety on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple 
TV. For example, if your iTunes and photo libraries combined are less than 
148GB and you have a 160GB iPod classic, simply copy everything. (You can 
see the size of your iTunes library in GB, or gigabytes, at the bottom of the 
iTunes window in the center.) Copying your entire library is just as fast as 
copying individual items (if not faster) because you don’t have to select among 
albums and movies, create special playlists to keep your devices filled, or do 
anything except connect the devices to your computer. iTunes does the rest.
iTunes is flexible in that you can use separate options to synchronize music, 
TV shows, movies, and so on. For example, you can copy to your iPod or 
iPhone all your songs and audio books, but only some of your TV shows, 
none of your movies, and only the podcasts you haven’t heard yet. Or you 
can automatically copy TV shows, movies, music videos, and podcasts, and 

184
Part II: Managing Your Media 
then manually copy music and audio books to your iPod to fill up the rest 
of the space, or delete music and audio books directly from your iPod if you 
need to make more room.
You have the option to set your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to automatically 
synchronize with your entire iTunes library when you set it up the first time. 
(See Chapter 2 for details on setting up your iPod, and Chapter 7 for details 
on setting up Apple TV.) You can also set these devices to sync automatically 
with specific content types — music, TV shows, movies, and so on — at any 
time. This chapter shows you how to synchronize your iPod, iPhone, and 
Apple TV with portions or all of your library, as well as how to copy content 
to these devices selectively. You can also copy music, audio books, and pod-
casts to your iPod or iPhone manually, and copy music to your iPod shuffle 
automatically or manually. (Apple TV synchronizes only by playlist.)
Synchronizing Your iPod or iPhone
When you set up your iPod or iPhone, you can choose the option to copy 
your entire iTunes library (or part of your library) automatically, matching 
it exactly, item for item, playlist for playlist. From that point on, your iPod or 
iPhone synchronizes with your library automatically, right after you connect 
it to your computer. 
If you make changes in iTunes after synchronizing a device, those changes 
are automatically made in the device when you synchronize again. If you add 
or delete content in your iTunes library, that content is added or deleted in 
the iPod or iPhone when you sync again.
If you store photos in an iPhoto library (on a Mac) or in a program (such as 
Adobe Photoshop Album in Windows), you can set up your iPod or iPhone 
with the option to copy your entire photo library. Your iPod or iPhone is 
then synchronized automatically so that any changes you make to the photo 
library are copied to the device.
 
Content items stored remotely (such as songs shared from other iTunes 
libraries on a network) aren’t synchronized because the files aren’t physically 
on your computer. (See Chapter 7 for more info on how to share iTunes files 
over a network with iTunes as well as how to copy files to different computers 
and their iTunes libraries.)
If you set your iPod or iPhone to synchronize automatically during the setup 
process (see Chapter 2), it starts synchronizing automatically after you 
connect it. Even so, you can choose content types to sync or not sync, as 
described in “Synchronizing Content Selectively” later in this chapter. Even 
so, you can then synchronize the device again after making changes to your 
sync options. 

185
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
Follow these steps to start synchronizing your iPod or iPhone (for an iPod 
shuffle, see “Synchronizing an iPod shuffle” later is this chapter):
 
1. With iTunes running, connect the iPod or iPhone, and select its name 
when it appears in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab 
of the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane, 
including how much space on the device is occupied by content and 
how much is still free. (Figure 11-1 shows an iPod touch Summary page, 
while Figure 11-2 shows an iPhone Summary page.)
 
2. If the iPod or iPhone isn’t automatically synchronizing, click the Sync 
button in the bottom-right corner to synchronize it.
 
 The iTunes Status pane tells you that iTunes is syncing the device. 
 
3. Wait for the synchronization to finish and then click the Eject button 
next to the iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane.
 
 You should always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) 
displays that the synchronization is complete (refer to Figure 11-2).
 
4. Disconnect your iPod or iPhone from your computer.
 
 Don’t disconnect your iPod or iPhone until its menu appears in its 
display.
 
 That’s it. Your iPod or iPhone is now synchronized.

You probably don’t need to know anything else in this chapter about 
synchronizing your iPod unless your iTunes library and additional photo 
library are too large to fit (see the upcoming section, “If Your Library Won’t 
Fit”). Or, if you want to be more selective about the content while 
synchronizing, see the later section, “Synchronizing Content Selectively.”
 
iTunes backs up your synchronization settings for each iPod or iPhone that 
you connect from the last time when you synchronized the device.
To prevent an iPod from automatically synchronizing, press Ô-Option (Mac) 
or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) while you connect the device, and then keep pressing 
until the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane.
 
If you connect an iPod previously linked to another computer to your com-
puter, iTunes displays a message warning you that clicking Yes replaces the 
device’s content with the content from your computer’s library. If you don’t 
want to change the iPod’s content, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes erases the 
iPod and synchronizes the device with your computer’s library.

187
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
Synchronizing Your Apple TV
Apple TV lets you play your iTunes library content on your home TV and stereo. 
When you set up your Apple TV (as described in Chapter 7), you can choose to 
have iTunes automatically copy all or part of your library to it, matching your 
library exactly, item for item, playlist for playlist. From that point on, your Apple 
TV synchronizes with your library automatically whenever you start iTunes. If 
you make changes in iTunes after synchronizing Apple TV, those changes are 
automatically made in Apple TV when you start iTunes again. 
You can also synchronize Apple TV at any time and customize the sync 
operation to include only the content items you choose. The content you 
synchronize to Apple TV is stored on the Apple TV hard drive for instant play-
back. However, you can also use Apple TV to play any content in your iTunes 
library, without synchronizing it, as long as iTunes is running and connected 
(wirelessly or by Ethernet network) to the Apple TV — the content is streamed 
from your computer to Apple TV, as described in Chapter 7. You can also use 
iTunes to play content on Apple TV using AirTunes, as described in Chapter 6.
Content items stored remotely (such as songs shared from other iTunes 
libraries on a network) aren’t synchronized because the files aren’t physically 
on your computer. Apple TV can stream content from other iTunes libraries 
on the same network, but it synchronizes with only one library. 
If you set up Apple TV to connect wirelessly or via Ethernet to your computer 
running iTunes (as described in Chapter 7), the name of your Apple TV 
automatically appears in the iTunes Source pane in the Devices section as 
soon as iTunes detects it on the network. You don’t have to do anything — 
iTunes immediately begins synchronizing the Apple TV device with your library. 
However, you can choose sync options to customize synchronization, which is 
especially useful if your iTunes library is larger than the capacity of your Apple TV.
Select the name of the Apple TV in the Devices section of the Source pane, 
as shown in Figure 11-3. The Summary page (under the Summary tab of the 
device’s synchronization pages) appears with synchronization options and 
information about how much space is occupied by content and how much is 
still free. You can then choose one of the following:
 
 The Automatic Sync option lets iTunes choose the audio and video to 
transfer over to the Apple TV with the priority on newer items. 
 
 The Custom Sync option lets you choose the audio and video to 
synchronize. iTunes transfers movies first, then TV shows, then music, 
and finally podcasts. After choosing Custom Sync, select content to 
synchronize as described in the “Synchronizing Content Selectively” 
section later in this chapter.
If synchronization doesn’t start automatically, click the Sync button in the 
bottom-right corner on the Summary page to start things rolling.

188
Part II: Managing Your Media

When Apple TV and iTunes get together, not only can you smile on your 
brother and love one another, but
 
 You can start playing while synchronizing. You can start watching video 
content (or listen to audio content) that has been synchronized and stored 
on Apple TV, even while Apple TV is still synchronizing the rest of it.
 
 You can play your library without synchronizing. You can use Apple 
TV to play content on your computer wirelessly over the network, with-
out synchronizing and saving the content on Apple TV, as long as iTunes 
is running — choose Music➪My Music from the Apple TV main menu.
 
 If your playlists don’t appear, iTunes isn’t connected to your Apple TV. 
(See Chapter 7 for details on how to set up your Apple TV.)
 
 You can play a shared library on another computer without 
synchronizing, and leave your synchronized Apple TV content intact. 
You can use Apple TV to play content on another computer wirelessly 
over the network, without synchronizing and saving the content on 
Apple TV, as long as iTunes is running on that computer — choose 
Settings➪Computers from the Apple TV main menu.
 
 You can resynchronize with another library. You can choose a 
different iTunes library on a different computer to synchronize and save 
content on your Apple TV. To synchronize with a different library, follow 
the instructions for choosing an iTunes library with Apple TV (see 
Chapter 7).

189
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
If Your Library Won’t Fit 
If your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, you 
can still keep it automatically synchronized to a subset of your library. You 
have several options:
 
 Synchronize content selectively. You can automatically synchronize 
your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to specific music and music video 
playlists, TV shows and movies, podcasts, and photo albums. (See the 
upcoming section, “Synchronizing Content Selectively.”) 
 
 Manage your content directly. You can also copy content directly to 
your iPod or iPhone and delete content on your iPod or iPhone. (See the 
later section, “Managing Content on Your iPod or iPhone Manually.”)
 
 Let iTunes decide what goes on the device. When you set up your 
iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, iTunes tries to fill the device if you choose to 
synchronize your entire library. If the library doesn’t entirely fit, iTunes 
decides which songs and albums to include by using the ratings that you 
set for each song, and it creates a playlist specifically for synchronizing 
with that device. When you sync again, iTunes again tries to fit more 
content, going as far as to suggest what other content to delete. I explain 
this method in this section.
 
 Create multiple iTunes libraries. You can create several subsets of 
your main library (sub-libraries) so that each sub-library could be small 
enough to fit on a certain type of device. For example, you might create 
a sub-library for a 32GB iPod touch, and another sub-library for an 8GB 
iPod nano. Before connecting a device, you could switch to its 
corresponding sub-library and then synchronize automatically. 
 
To find out how to manage multiple iTunes libraries, visit this book’s 
companion Web site. 
If you’ve synchronized your iPod or iPhone before but your iTunes library 
has grown larger and now won’t fit, iTunes first checks for photos on the 
device. If your iPod or iPhone already has photos on it, iTunes asks whether 
you want to delete them to gain more space. After clicking Yes or No, iTunes 
tries its best to fit everything. If it has to cut something, though, it skips the 
photos and displays the message Some photos were not copied.
If you’re still short of space even after skipping photos, iTunes displays a 
warning about the lack of free space, and it asks whether you want to disable 
podcast synchronization for the device and let iTunes create a selection of 
songs.

190
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
 If you click Yes, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled Your device name 
Selection, as in “TBone iPod Video Selection”) and displays a message 
telling you so. Click OK, and iTunes synchronizes your iPod or iPhone 
using the new playlist. iTunes also sets your iPod or iPhone to 
synchronize music automatically by playlist, as I describe later in 
“Synchronizing Content Selectively.”
 
 If you click No, iTunes updates automatically until it fills your iPod or 
iPhone without creating the playlist.
Either way, iTunes decides which songs and albums to include by using the 
ratings that you set for each song. iTunes groups album tracks together and 
computes an average rating and play count for the album. It then fills the 
iPod or iPhone, giving higher priority to albums with play counts and 
ratings greater than zero. You can therefore influence the decisions that 
iTunes makes by adding ratings to songs or entire albums; see Chapter 9.
The 40GB Apple TV actually holds about 32 gigabytes of iTunes library content; 
the 160GB model holds about 144GB. (The rest of the space is occupied by the 
system and media files provided by Apple.) Your iTunes library could be larger 
than your Apple TV’s capacity, so iTunes synchronizes Apple TV starting with 
all movies and TV shows before moving on to music videos, music, audio 
books, podcasts, and finally photos. See the following section to discover how 
to copy playlists and items selectively to your Apple TV.
Synchronizing Content Selectively
Even if your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, 
you can still use automatic methods to synchronize them. Just be selective, 
choosing which content to automatically synchronize from your iTunes library.
You can automatically keep your device synchronized to a subset of your 
library, adding new material under your control, in the following ways:
 
 Select content items to ignore during synchronization with iPods and 
iPhones.
 
 Create playlists of the music you want to transfer, or create a smart 
playlist that selects content for you (as described in Chapter 10) and 
then synchronize by playlists.
 
 Select which movies to transfer. Movies take up the most space in an 
iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV device.
 
 Select which TV shows to transfer. TV shows take up considerable 
space in an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. 

191
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
 Select which podcasts to transfer. Some podcasts offer daily and weekly 
episodes that take up a lot of space, and you may want to limit the 
number of episodes.
 
 Limit the transfer and synchronization of photos to albums or 
collections rather than the entire photo library.
I give you instructions for each of these options in the following sections.
By synchronizing selectively, you can still make your iPod, iPhone, or Apple 
TV match at least a subset of your iTunes library. If you make changes to that 
subset in iTunes, those changes are automatically made in the device when 
you synchronize again. For example, if you change your settings to update by 
certain playlists, any changes you make to those playlists — adding or 
deleting songs, for example — are reflected in your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV 
the next time you synchronize it to your computer.
Selecting items to ignore 
when synchronizing
You can decide which items you don’t want to synchronize, and simply not 
include them with your iPod or iPhone. (This feature is not available with 
Apple TV.) To use this method, you must first deselect the items in your 
iTunes library that you don’t want to transfer. If you have a large iTunes 
library, this may take some time — you may find it easier to synchronize by 
playlists, as described in the later section, “Choosing playlists to synchronize.”
By default, all content items are selected — a check mark appears in the 
check box next to the item. To deselect an item in your iTunes library, 
deselect the check box next to the item. To deselect a podcast episode, 
open the podcast first; then deselect the check box next to the episode. (See 
Chapter 6 for information about opening and playing podcasts.) To reselect 
an item, just select the check box.
 
You can quickly select (or deselect) an entire album by selecting it in Browse 
view and pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) while making your selections. 
(See Chapter 8 for more on browsing and making selections.)
After you deselect the items you don’t want to transfer, connect your iPod or 
iPhone to your computer. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 After selecting the name, the Summary page for that device appears, 
displaying the device’s synchronization options. (Refer to Figure 11-1 for 
an iPod touch or Figure 11-2 for an iPhone.)

192
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
2. Select the Sync Only Checked Songs and Videos option, click Apply, and 
then click Sync if synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes restarts synchronization and deletes from the device any items 
in the library that are deselected, to save space, before adding back 
in the items in the iTunes library that are selected. That means the 
deselected items are now gone from your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV — 
replaced by whatever items were selected. Of course, the items are still 
in your iTunes library. 
 
3. Wait for the updating to finish and then click the Eject button next to 
the iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane tells you the sync is complete 
before ejecting your iPod or iPhone.
Choosing playlists to synchronize
When syncing your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, you can include just the items 
defined in playlists. You can create an infinite number of playlists of any 
length, including Genius playlists (see Chapter 10). The Music tab of the 
synchronization pages for the device gives you options for choosing music 
in playlists.
For example, you can create four playlists that contain all essential rock, folk, 
blues, and jazz albums, and then select all four, or just one, two, or three of 
these playlists to synchronize with your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. You can 
create sets of playlists specifically for synchronizing different devices, such 
as your Apple TV set containing movie-related music, or an all-jazz set for 
your iPod.
 
Synchronizing automatically by playlists is also an easy way to automatically 
synchronize an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV when a large iTunes library won’t 
fit in its entirety. You can also drag songs and albums directly to your iPod or 
iPhone just like you do with any other content item, as I describe in the later 
section, “Managing Content on Your iPod or iPhone Manually.”
Before using this option, create the playlists in iTunes (see Chapter 10) that 
you want to copy to the device and then connect your iPod or iPhone to 
your computer. (If you’re synchronizing an Apple TV, it should already be 
detected and in the Source pane.) Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab of 
the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane.
 
2. Click the Music tab of the synchronization pages.
 
 The Music synchronization options page appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.

 You can scroll to see all your playlists. Click the check box to select a 
playlist. In Figure 11-4, I selected two Genius playlists and the Recently 
Added smart playlist. (Chapter 10 has info on creating playlists.)
 
5. Click Apply to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically. 
 
 iTunes synchronizes the device by erasing its contents and copying only 
the playlists that you select in Step 4.
iTunes copies only the music and audio books in these playlists. If you also 
select the Include Music Videos option (as in Figure 11-4) on the Music 
synchronization options page, iTunes includes music videos listed in the 
playlists. You can also show album cover art on color-display iPods by 
selecting the Display Album Artwork on your iPod option. (iPod touch and 
iPhone models automatically display album artwork.)
 
If you select Sync Only Checked Items on the Summary page of the device syn-
chronization options (refer to Figure 11-1 for an iPod touch or Figure 11-2 for 
an iPhone), only checked items are copied. iTunes ignores unchecked items 
unchecked, even if they’re listed in the chosen playlists for synchronization.

194
Part II: Managing Your Media 
To select all the music and audio books in your library, select the Sync 
Music option and then select the All Songs and Playlists option on the 
Music synchronization options page. 
Choosing movies to synchronize
Movies take up a lot of space, so if you limit the movies you synchronize with 
your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV you gain extra space for more content.
The movies portion of your library includes movies downloaded from 
the iTunes Store and video files copied into the iTunes library from other 
sources. Any video file that isn’t a TV show or music video downloaded from 
the iTunes Store is categorized as a movie in your iTunes library. Music 
videos downloaded from the iTunes Store are included in the music section 
of your library; see the earlier section, “Choosing playlists to synchronize.”
 
You can also drag movies directly to your iPod or iPhone just like you do with 
any other content item, as I describe in the later section, “Managing Content 
on Your iPod or iPhone Manually.”
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab of 
the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane.
 
2. Click the Movies tab for an iPod or Apple TV, or the Video tab for an 
iPhone.
 
 You see either the Movies synchronization options page (for an iPod 
touch, as shown in Figure 11-5) or the Video synchronization options 
page (for an iPhone).
 
3. Select the movie synchronization options for the device.
 
 For an iPod, select the Sync Movies option (as shown in Figure 11-5), and 
then select one of the following options:
 
• All Movies: Synchronizes all movies with your iPod.
 
• Unwatched Movies: You can choose to synchronize all unwatched 
movies, or choose from the pop-up menu the most recently added 
unwatched movie (1 most recent), or the 3, 5, or 10 most recently 
added unwatched movies (3, 5, or 10 most recent).
 
• Selected: You can select specific movies or video playlists. Scroll 
the list box to see all your movies or video playlists. Click the 
check box to select a movie or video playlist to synchronize with 
the device.

iTunes ignores items that are unchecked.
Choosing TV shows to synchronize
TV shows also take up a lot of space, but you can limit the number of epi-
sodes you synchronize with your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to gain extra 
space for more content.
 
You can also drag TV show episodes directly to your iPod or iPhone just like 
you do with any other content item, as I describe in the upcoming section, 
“Managing Content on Your iPod or iPhone Manually.”
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source 
pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab of 
the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane.

 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
2. Click the TV Shows tab for an iPod or Apple TV, or the Video tab for 
an iPhone.
 
 The TV Shows synchronization options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-7 for an iPod touch; for an iPhone, the Video synchronization 
page appears with separate sections for TV Shows and Movies.

3. Select the Sync Episodes Of option and choose a modifier from the 
pop-up menu.
 
 You can choose from the pop-up menu to synchronize all unwatched 
episodes; the most recently added episode (1 most recent); or the 3, 5, 
or 10 most recently added episodes (3, 5, or 10 most recent). You can 
also select unwatched recently added episodes in the same increments.
 
4. Select one of the following options below the Sync Episodes Of option:
 
• All TV Shows: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for all 
shows with your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
 
• Selected: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for selected 
TV shows. For example, in Figure 11-7, I’m synchronizing all 
unwatched episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series but no other 
TV shows. You can select specific TV shows or video playlists of 
TV show episodes. Scroll the list box to see all your TV shows or 
video playlists. Mark the check box to select a TV show or video 
playlist to synchronize with the device.

198
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
5. Click Apply to apply changes and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes synchronizes the device by erasing its contents and copying only 
the TV show episodes that you selected in Steps 3 and 4.
Choosing podcasts to synchronize
Although you can listen to an audio podcast or watch a video podcast at any 
time on your computer, a podcast’s real value is that you can take it with 
you in your iPod or iPhone, or play it on your home TV and stereo with your 
Apple TV. You can keep your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV automatically 
synchronized with the most recent podcast episodes.
 
You can also drag podcast episodes directly to your iPod or iPhone just like 
you do with any other content item, as I describe in the upcoming section, 
“Managing Content on Your iPod or iPhone Manually.”
The Podcasts tab of the synchronization pages for the device gives you 
options for choosing podcast episodes to include. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab of 
the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane.
 
2. Click the Podcasts tab.
 
 The Podcasts synchronization options page appears. (Figure 11-8 shows 
the page for an iPod touch.)
 
3. Select the Sync Episodes Of option and choose a modifier from the 
pop-up menu.
 
 You can choose from the pop-up menu to synchronize all unplayed 
episodes; the most recently added episode (1 most recent); or the 3, 5, 
or 10 most recently added episodes (3, 5, or 10 most recent). You can 
also select unplayed recently added episodes and new episodes in the 
same increments.
 
4. Select one of the following podcast options below the Sync Episodes 
Of option:
 
• All Podcasts: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for all 
podcasts with your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
 
• Selected Podcasts: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for 
selected podcasts. For example, in Figure 11-8, I’m synchronizing all 
episodes of the selected podcasts. (Use the pop-up menu to switch 
from “all” to other choices, such as all unplayed episodes of the 
selected podcasts.) Scroll the list box to see all your podcasts. Click 
the check box next to each podcast to synchronize with the device.

5. Click Apply to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes synchronizes the device by erasing its contents and copying only 
the episodes of podcasts that you selected in Steps 3 and 4.
 
If you set iTunes to keep only your unplayed episodes, listen to part of a 
podcast episode on your iPod or iPhone, and then synchronize your iPod or 
iPhone, the podcast episode disappears from iTunes.
 
As described in Chapter 6, iTunes can keep track of the playback position so 
that when you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop 
listening to it, just like a bookmark in an audio book. iTunes resumes 
playing from the bookmark when you return to the podcast to play it. You can 
synchronize podcasts with filenames ending with .m4b to an iPod, iPhone, or 
Apple TV and never lose your bookmarked place, whether you listen on your 
iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, or even your computer.
Choosing photo albums to synchronize
You can take your pictures with you, safely tucked into your iPod or iPhone, 
and you can display slide shows at home with your Apple TV. On a Mac, you 
can use iPhoto to import photos into your computer and organize them into 
albums. You can then use iTunes to transfer photos from your iPhoto library 
automatically.

200
Part II: Managing Your Media 
In Windows, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album or Photoshop Elements 
to import photos onto your computer and to organize your photos into 
collections. You can then use iTunes to transfer photos from your photo 
library automatically.
 
To learn more about organizing photos into albums, visit this book’s 
companion Web site.
If you don’t have any of these programs, you can use any other photo-editing 
or photo-organizing software and store your photos in a folder on your hard 
drive, or on a CD or server volume. You can then use iTunes to transfer 
photos from the folder, treating the folder as a photo album. The folder could 
be on CD-ROM, DVD data disc, or on a server volume as long as the CD-ROM, 
DVD data disc, or volume is mounted.
Whether you transfer photos from a library or from a folder on your hard drive, 
you can keep your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV synchronized with the photo 
library and its albums or with the subfolders and image files in the folder.
 
If you chose to copy your entire photo library when you set up your iPod, 
iPhone, or Apple TV, your entire photo library syncs automatically. Any 
changes you make to the library are consequently copied to your iPod, 
iPhone, or Apple TV. 
To transfer only photos in specific albums in a library to your iPod and keep 
your iPod synchronized with these albums (not the entire library), follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source 
pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab of 
the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane.
 
2. Click the Photos tab.
 
 The Photos synchronization options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-9.
 
3. Select the Sync Photos From option and then choose a photo library 
or a folder from the pop-up menu.
 
 You can choose your photo library (such as iPhoto on a Mac, or Adobe 
Photoshop Album in Windows) from the pop-up menu to synchronize 
photo albums, or you can choose a folder from the pop-up menu. You 
can also choose Folder from the pop-up menu to browse files and 
folders on your hard drive or other storage media (such as a CD-ROM 
or a server volume). In Finder or Windows Explorer, browse your hard 
drive or other storage media for the folder containing images and then 
click Choose (Mac) or OK (Windows).

201
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
Figure 11-9: 
Synchronize 
your iPod

 If you want photos in a folder to appear in separate photo albums on 
your iPod or iPhone, use the Finder on a Mac, or Windows Explorer 
on Windows, to create subfolders inside the folder and organize your 
photos and image files inside these subfolders. iTunes copies the sub-
folder assignments as if they were album assignments.
 
4. Select one of the following photo options below the Sync Photos From 
option:
 
• All Photos and Albums: Synchronizes all photos and albums from 
the library or folder selected in Step 3 with your iPod, iPhone, or 
Apple TV.
 
• Selected Albums: Synchronizes the photo albums from the library 
(or subfolders from the folder) selected in Step 3. For example, 
in Figure 11-9, I synchronize from my iPhoto library the selected 
albums “Band Tour NW & NY” and “Band Tour-slideshow.” Scroll 
the list box to see all the photo albums in your photo library (or 
subfolders in your folder). Click the check box next to each photo 
album (or subfolder) to synchronize with the device.
 
5. Click Apply to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes synchronizes the device by erasing its contents and copying only 
the photo albums that you selected in Step 4.

202
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
iTunes copies all other types of content first before even bothering to copy 
photos, but you can influence the order in which iTunes copies photo albums. 
When you select photo albums to synchronize in Step 4, you can drag the 
albums in the list into any order you choose — for example, you can select 
and drag the most important photo albums to the top of the list.
 
No matter what photo application you use, you can save photos as image files 
in a folder on your hard drive and then bring them into your iPod or iPhone 
whenever you want. It’s rare for an iPod to meet an image file format it doesn’t 
like. On a Mac, use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), Pict, PNG, PSD (Photoshop), 
PDF, jpg 2000, SGI, and BMP. In Windows, use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), PNG, 
and BMP.
Managing Content on Your 
iPod or iPhone Manually
By setting your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, you 
can add content to your iPod and iPhone directly via iTunes, and you can 
delete content as well. 
 
You might have one or more reasons for managing content manually, but here 
are some obvious ones:
 
 Your entire library is too big for your iPod or iPhone, and you want to 
copy individual items directly.
 
 You want to share a single library with several iPods (or an iPod and an 
iPhone), and you have different song selections that you want to copy to 
each them directly.
 
 You share an iPod with others, and you want to copy your content to 
the iPod without wiping out its existing content.
 
 You want to copy some songs or videos from another computer’s iTunes 
library without deleting any content from your iPod or iPhone.
 
 You want to edit the playlists and content information directly on your 
iPod or iPhone without changing anything in your computer’s library.
When you set your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, 
all contents on your iPod or iPhone are active and available in iTunes. You 
can copy items directly to your iPod or iPhone, delete items on the iPod or 
iPhone, and edit the iPod or iPhone playlists directly.
To set your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, first 
connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer. Then follow these steps:

203
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
1. Select the iPod or iPhone name in the Devices section of the iTunes 
Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the device’s Summary page (under the Summary tab 
of the device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane. 
(Refer to Figure 11-1 for an iPod touch or Figure 11-2 for an iPhone.)
 
2. Select the Manually Manage Music and Videos option and then click 
OK to the warning.
 
 iTunes displays a message warning you that disabling automatic 
synchronization requires manually ejecting the iPod or iPhone before 
each disconnect.
 
3. Click Apply to apply the change.
 
Don’t disconnect your iPod or iPhone while managing music and videos 
manually. You have to eject the device and wait until it displays the message 
OK to disconnect (in first- and second-generation iPods) or the main 
menu. You risk making the device’s hard drive or flash memory unreadable, 
forcing you to restore it to its original factory condition (see Chapter 20).
After setting your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, you 
can copy items directly to your iPod or iPhone (and even select the iPod or 
iPhone content directly to delete it, as I describe later in this section). 
Copying items directly
As soon as you set your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and 
videos, you can copy music and video directly from your iTunes library. 
Follow these steps (with your device connected to your computer):
 
1. Select Music in the iTunes Source pane in the Library section (or a 
playlist in the library).
 
 You can select music in your library using List, Grid, or Cover Flow view, 
or select songs in a playlist. In Figure 11-10, I’m using Cover Flow.
 
2. Drag items directly from your iTunes library or playlist over the iPod 
or iPhone name in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 You can drag an entire album from Cover Flow view, as I do in Figure 
11-10, or from List or Grid view. When you drag an album cover or album 
title, all the songs in the album are copied. When you drag a playlist 
name, all the songs associated with the playlist copy along with the play-
list itself.

204
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
Figure 11-10:

the iTunes 
library to an 
iPod (“Mojo 
Touch”).
 
 
3. Wait for the copying to finish and then click Eject to eject the iPod or 
iPhone.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the 
copying is completed.
 
4. Disconnect your iPod or iPhone from your computer.
 
 Don’t disconnect your iPod or iPhone until its menu appears in its display.
Deleting items on your iPod or iPhone
When you manually manage music and videos, you can delete content from 
the iPod or iPhone directly. Manual deletion is a nice feature if you just want 
to go in and delete a song, video, or album to make room for new content.
To delete any item in your iPod or iPhone, set the option to manually manage 
music and videos (if it isn’t set that way already) and then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source pane, click the triangle next to the iPod or iPhone name 
to expand its library.
 
 The library appears in the Source pane with Music, Movies, TV Shows, 
and other sections, followed by playlists — indented underneath the 
device’s name. 
 
2. Click any content type in the library to see the items.
 
 The content items appear in the iTunes List pane to the right of the 
Source pane. 

205
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
3. Select an item and press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK 
to go ahead or Cancel to stop. If you want to delete a playlist, select the 
playlist underneath the iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane, and 
press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
Like in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the items listed in the playlist 
aren’t deleted. They’re still on your iPod or iPhone unless you delete the items 
directly from the iPod or iPhone library.
Synchronizing an iPod shuffle
The iPod shuffle is designed for quick and convenient music synchronizing. 
Just plug it into your computer and then click the Autofill button in iTunes. It 
also offers automatic compression to fit more songs (or audio books, which 
are treated as songs) into your iPod shuffle space.
Although Apple proudly advertises its ability to shuffle songs randomly, the 
key to its success isn’t that you can shuffle the songs already there but that 
you can copy random songs to it every time you connect it to your computer. 
Eventually, you can shuffle through everything in your library if you so wish, 
by randomly filling your iPod shuffle every time. On the other hand, you can 
fine-tune your random selection and even reorder the iPod shuffle’s playlist 
to play back in a specific order.
Although you can add songs to your iPod shuffle manually by dragging a play-
list or song, you can also automatically fill it without having to set options for 
automatic updating. Autofill automatically picks songs from your entire iTunes 
library or from a playlist you select in the Source pane. You can also manage the 
playlist for your iPod shuffle directly, after using Autofill, to fine-tune your 
selection.
Using Autofill
To use Autofill to copy songs to your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the iPod shuffle to your computer.
 
 When you connect an iPod shuffle to your computer, its name shows up 
in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
2. Select the iPod shuffle in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 The Autofill pane appears below the List pane, as shown in Figure 11-11. 
The songs on the iPod shuffle appear in List view, replacing the view of 
your library.

206
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
Figure 11-11: 
Autofill 
your iPod 
shuffle from 
an iTunes 
playlist.
 
 
3. Choose your source of music in the Autofill From pop-up menu.
 
 Choose either a playlist or Music (for the entire music library). If you 
choose a playlist, Autofill uses only the playlist as the source of music. 
After choosing your source of music, iTunes creates a playlist and 
displays it in the List pane. 
 
4. (Optional) To pick random songs, select the Choose Items Randomly 
option.
 
5. (Optional) To pick only the best songs (if you’re choosing them 
randomly), select the Choose Higher Rated Items More Often option.
 
6. (Optional) To replace songs already on the iPod shuffle, select the 
Replace All Items When Autofilling option.
 
 If you don’t select this option, iTunes adds the songs without replacing 
existing songs.
 
7. Click the Autofill button to start copying songs.
 
 iTunes copies the contents of the playlist to your iPod shuffle.
 
8. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the Eject button.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the 
copying is finished.

207
 Chapter 11: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes
 
You can click the Autofill button over and over to create different random 
playlists. When you get one you like, select all its contents and choose 
File➪New Playlist From Selection to create a new playlist that contains the 
songs generated by Autofill. The next time you connect your iPod shuffle, 
select this new playlist from the Autofill From pop-up menu and then click the 
Autofill button to load the music from the playlist to your shuffle.
 
iPod shuffle can play audio books sold by the iTunes Store and by Audible.com. 
Unfortunately, iTunes won’t automatically add them to the iPod shuffle — you 
have to add them manually. Be sure to play audio book sections on your iPod 
shuffle in sequential order rather than in random (shuffle) order, or you may 
hear chapters in the wrong order — see Chapter 14 for details on playing 
content on an iPod shuffle.
Copying and deleting items manually
iPod shuffle is always set for manual management. When you connect an iPod 
shuffle to your computer, you can copy music (or audio books) directly to it, 
delete items on it, and edit its playlist.
To copy items to your iPod shuffle directly, connect it to your computer and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select Music in the iTunes Source pane in the Library section.
 
 Your music library’s content appears in List view.
 
2. Drag and drop items directly from your iTunes library to the iPod 
shuffle’s name in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 When you copy a playlist, all the songs in the playlist are copied. When 
you copy an album, all the songs in the album are copied.
 
 
3. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the iPod Eject 
button.
To delete any item in your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the iPod shuffle in the Devices section of the iTunes Source 
pane.
 
 The songs on the iPod shuffle appear in List view, replacing the view of 
your library.
 
2. Select one or more songs on the iPod shuffle and then press Delete/
Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to 
go ahead or Cancel to stop.

 Backing up your entire iTunes library
Y
ou might think that your digital content is safe, stored as-is, on your 
iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and hard drive. However, demons in the night 
are working overtime to render your hard drive useless — and at the same 
time, someone left your iPod out in the rain, your iPhone can’t phone home, 
and your Apple TV is on the fritz.
Copyright law and common sense prohibit you from using copyrighted 
content and then selling it to someone else. However, with iTunes, you’re 
allowed to make copies of music, videos, audio books, and podcasts that you 
own for personal use, including copies for backup purposes.
This chapter boils down everything you need to know about burning your 
own discs to make copies of your content. I burn audio CDs or MP3 CDs to 
make safety copies of songs I buy from the iTunes Store. I also like to custom-
mix songs from different artists and albums onto an audio or MP3 CD. 
I burn data DVDs to back up my video files — and I also copy my entire 
iTunes library to another hard drive as a backup, as I describe in this chap-
ter. This operation is very important, especially if you’ve purchased items 
that don’t exist anywhere else in your collection but on your computer. That 
way, even if your hard drive fails, you still have your iTunes library. 
 
To find out how to consolidate media files into one library, how to manage 
multiple iTunes libraries for easier synchronization with multiple devices, and 
how to move a library from one computer to another (such as a PC to a Mac 
or vice versa), visit this book’s companion Web site. 

210
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
You should not rely on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV as your sole music 
storage device or as a backup for your iTunes library, because you can’t copy 
content from your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to your computer via iTunes. It’s 
a one-way trip from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV because record 
labels and video distributors don’t want indiscriminate copying, and Apple 
has complied with these requests. You can, however, use third-party utility pro-
grams (not supported by Apple) to copy content both ways. 
 
To learn more about third-party utility programs for managing your iPod or 
iPhone, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
The iTunes Store uses Apple FairPlay technology for many songs, which 
protects the rights of copyright holders while also giving you some leeway in 
using the copyrighted content. But you can still copy the media files freely so 
that backup is easy and straightforward on either a Mac or a PC.
 
Do not violate copyright law. You’re allowed to copy content for your own use, 
but you cannot legally copy content for any other purpose. Consult a lawyer if 
you’re in doubt.
Burning Your Own Discs 
Once upon a time, when vinyl records were popular, rock radio disk jockeys 
(who didn’t like disco) held disco-meltdown parties. People were encour-
aged to throw their disco records onto a pile to be burned or steamrolled into 
a vinyl glob. I admit that I shamelessly participated in one such meltdown. 
However, this section isn’t about that (nor is it about anything involving fire 
or heat). Rather, burning a disc is the process in which the CD drive recorder’s 
laser heats up points on an interior layer of the disc to record information.
Using recordable CDs and DVDs
If you have a CD-R, CD-RW, or DVD-R drive (such as the Apple SuperDrive 
for a Mac) and a blank CD-R (R stands for recordable), you can burn music, 
audio books, and audio podcast episodes on audio CDs that play in most CD 
players. You can fit up to 74 minutes of music on a high-quality audio-format 
CD-R; most can go as high as 80 minutes.
Blank audio CD-Rs (I’m talking discs now and not drives) are available in 
stores that carry consumer electronics. You can also get them online from 
the Apple Store (not the music store — the store that sells computers and 
accessories). Choose iTunes➪Shop for iTunes Products (Mac) or Help➪Shop 
for iTunes Products (Windows) to reach the Apple Store online.

211
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
You can also burn an audio CD-R of song files in the MP3 format, which is 
useful for backing up a music library or making discs for use in MP3 CD play-
ers. You can play MP3 files burned on a CD-R in MP3 format on any MP3 
disc player, on combination CD/MP3 players, on many DVD players, and (of 
course) on computers that recognize MP3-formatted CDs (including comput-
ers with iTunes). An MP3-formatted CD-R can hold more than 12 hours of 
music. You read that right — 12 hours on one disc. This is why MP3 discs are 
popular: because they are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them. 
If you have a DVD burner, such as an Apple SuperDrive, you can burn data 
discs in the DVD-R or DVD-RW formats to use with other computers. This 
approach is suitable for making backup copies of media files (or any data 
files). A DVD-R can hold about 4,700,000,000 bytes (more than 4GB).
Creating a disc burn playlist
To burn a CD (actually a CD-R, but most people refer to recordable CD-R 
discs as CDs), you must first define a playlist for the CD. (See Chapter 10 to 
find out how to create a playlist.) You can use songs encoded in any format 
that iTunes supports; however, you get higher-quality music with the uncom-
pressed AIFF and WAV formats or with the Apple Lossless format. (You 
can back up your library to DVD without creating a playlist, as I describe in 
“Backing up to DVD-R or CD-R discs” later in this chapter.)
The little Red Book that launched an industry
Typical audio CDs and CD-Rs use the Compact 
Disc-Digital Audio (CD-DA) format Mode 2 Form 
2, better known as Red Book. This book isn’t 
something from Chairman Mao: It’s a document 
(published in 1980) that provides the specifica-
tions for the standard CD developed by Sony 
and Philips. According to legend, this document 
was in a binder with a red cover.
Here’s another legend: In 1979, Norio Ohga, 
honorary chairman and former CEO of Sony (and 
a maestro conductor), overruled his engineers 
and insisted that the CD format be able to hold 
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. This symphony 
is 74 minutes and 42 seconds long — now the 
standard length of a Red Book audio CD.
CD-DA defines audio data digitized at 44,100 
samples per second (44.1 kHz) and in a range 
of 65,536 possible values (16 bits). The format 
for the audio is called pulse code modulation 
(PCM).
To import music onto the computer from an 
audio CD, you have to convert the music to digi-
tal sound files by a program, such as iTunes. 
When you burn an audio CD, iTunes converts 
the sound files back into the CD-DA format 
while it burns the disc.

212
Part II: Managing Your Media 
If your playlist includes music purchased from the iTunes Store in the pro-
tected AAC-encoding format, some rules might apply. For example, as of this 
writing, the iTunes Store allows you to burn seven copies of the same playlist 
containing protected songs to an audio CD, but no more.
 
You can get around this limitation by creating or using a new playlist, copying 
the protected songs to the new playlist, and then burning more CDs with the 
new playlist.
Calculating how much music to use
When you create an audio CD playlist, you can calculate how many songs can 
fit on the CD by totaling the durations of the songs. You can see the size of a 
playlist by selecting it; the bottom of the iTunes window shows the number 
of songs, the duration of the songs, and the amount in megabytes for the 
selected playlist. Click the duration to see a more precise total time for the 
playlist, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
Figure 12-1: 
Click the 
duration of 
the playlist 
below the 
List pane to 
see the total 
time.
 
In Figure 12-1, the selected playlist takes about 1.1 hours (exactly 1:08:54) to 
play, so it fits on a standard audio CD. (The 15 songs take up only 65.3MB of 
hard drive space; they were purchased from the iTunes Store and encoded in 
the compressed and protected AAC format.)
 
A one-hour playlist of AIFF-encoded music, which might occupy over 600MB of 
hard drive space, also fits on a standard audio CD. You calculate the amount 
you can fit on a standard audio CD using the duration, not the hard drive 
space occupied by the music files. Although a CD holds between 650MB and 
700MB (depending on the disc), the music is stored in a special format known 
as CD-DA (or Red Book) that fills byte sectors without error-correction and 
checksum information. (You can read about CD-DA and Red Book in the side-
bar, “The little Red Book that launched an industry.”) Thus, you can fit about 

213
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
90MB more — 740MB total — of AIFF-encoded music on a 650MB disc. I typi-
cally put 1.1 hours (about 66 minutes) of music on a 74-minute or an 80-minute 
CD-R, leaving minutes to spare.
 
Always use the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate 
how much music you can fit on an audio CD — either 74 or 80 minutes for 
blank CD-Rs. I recommend leaving at least one extra minute to account for the 
gaps between songs.
You do the opposite for an MP3 CD or a data DVD. Use the actual megabytes 
to calculate how many song files can fit on a disc — up to 700MB for a blank 
CD-R. You can fit lots more music on an MP3 CD-R because you use MP3-
encoded songs rather than uncompressed AIFF songs.
If you have too many songs in the playlist to fit on a CD, iTunes gives you the 
option to cancel the burn operation, or to burn as many songs in the playlist 
as will fit on the CD (either audio or MP3). Then it asks you to insert another 
CD to continue burning the remaining songs in the playlist.
Importing music for an audio CD-R
Before you rip an audio CD of songs that you want to burn to an audio CD-R, 
as I describe in Chapter 5, you might want to change the import settings. Use 
the AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless encoders for songs from audio CDs if you 
want to burn your own audio CDs with music at its highest quality. You can 
also burn MP3-encoded songs on an audio CD, but the quality is not as good 
as with AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless.
AIFF is the standard digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and 
you can’t go wrong with it. WAV is basically the same thing for Windows. The 
Apple Lossless encoder provides CD-quality sound in a file size that’s about 
55 to 60 percent of the size of an AIFF- or WAV-encoded file. Both the AIFF 
encoder and the WAV encoder offer the same custom settings for sample 
rate, sample size, and channels, which you can set by choosing Custom from 
the Settings pop-up menu in the Importing section of the Advanced pane 
of iTunes Preferences. You can choose the automatic settings, and iTunes 
detects the proper sample rate, size, and channels from the source. Apple 
Lossless is always set to automatic.
 
Many songs you can purchase from the iTunes Store are supplied in an unpro-
tected format encoded in AAC that carries no restrictions. (The format is also 
known as iTunes Plus.) However, others are sold in a protected AAC format. 
You can’t convert the protected format to anything else, but you can still burn 
the songs onto CDs, and the quality of the result on CD is acceptable. Audio 
books also come in a protected format that can’t be converted by iTunes, but 
you can burn them onto CDs with acceptable quality.

214
Part II: Managing Your Media 
The AAC encoder creates an audio file that is similar in audio quality to one 
created by the MP3 encoder, but takes up less space; both are acceptable to 
most CD listeners. I think AAC offers a decent trade-off of space and quality 
and is suitable (although not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless) for burning 
to an audio CD. 
 
For a complete description of these encoders, visit this book’s companion 
Web site. 
Switching import encoders for MP3 CD-R
MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them. Consumer MP3 
CD players are readily available in consumer electronics stores, including 
hybrid models that play both audio CDs and MP3 CDs.
You can fit 8–12 hours of stereo music on an MP3 CD with the MP3 format — 
the amount varies depending on the encoding options and settings you 
choose. For example, you might be able to fit up to 20 hours of mono (mon-
aural) recordings because they use only one channel and carry less informa-
tion. On the other hand, if you encode stereo recordings at high bit rates 
(above 192 bits per second), you may fit up to 9 hours. 
 
You can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not 
encoded in MP3 are skipped and not burned. Audible books and commercial 
spoken-word titles are typically provided in an audio format that uses security 
technologies, including encryption, to protect purchased content; however, 
you can include anything that is encoded in MP3, including audio books from 
other sources. But you can’t burn an MP3 CD-R with Audible files; any Audible 
files in a burn playlist are skipped when you burn an MP3 CD-R.
Burning a disc
Burning a CD is a simple process, and getting it right the first time is a good 
idea because when you burn a CD-R, it’s done — right or wrong. You can’t 
erase content and reuse a CD-R. Fortunately, CD-Rs are inexpensive, so you 
won’t be out more than a few cents if you burn a bad one. (Besides, they’re 
good as coasters for coffee tables.)
Follow these steps to burn a disc:
 
1. Select the playlist and then click the Burn Disc button.
 
 The Burn Disc button appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window whenever you select a playlist (refer to Figure 12-1). After click-
ing Burn Disc, the Burn Settings dialog appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.

215
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
 
2. Select options in the Burn Settings dialog and click OK.
 
 See the following section, “Choosing your burn settings,” for instructions 
on selecting these important options.
 
3. Insert a blank disc (label side up).
 
 iTunes immediately checks the media and begins the burn process, dis-
playing a progress bar and the names of the songs burning to the disc.
 
 If you chose the MP3 CD format, iTunes skips over any songs in the play-
list that aren’t in this format.
 
 When iTunes finishes burning the disc, iTunes chimes, and the disc is 
mounted on the Desktop.
 
4. Eject the newly burned disc from your drive and then test it.
 
5. Don’t delete your burn playlist yet.
 
 You can read why in the later section, “Troubleshooting burns.”
Burning takes several minutes. You can cancel the operation at any time by 
clicking the X next to the progress bar, but canceling the operation isn’t like 
undoing the burn. If the burn has already started, you can’t use that CD-R or 
DVD-R again.
If the playlist has more music than can fit on the disc using the chosen 
format, iTunes asks whether you want to create multiple audio CDs with the 
playlist. If you choose to create multiple audio CDs, iTunes burns as much 
as possible from the beginning of the playlist and then asks you to insert 
another disc to burn the rest. To calculate the amount of music in a playlist, 
see the earlier section, “Calculating how much music to use.”
 
Spoken word fans: Audible audio books with chapter markers are burned onto 
a CD with each chapter as a separate track.
Choosing your burn settings
Set the following options in the Burn Settings dialog to ensure that you burn 
your CD right the first time:
 
 Preferred Speed: Choose a specific recording speed or the Maximum 
Possible option from the Preferred Speed pop-up menu. iTunes typi-
cally detects the rating of a blank CD-R and adjusts the recording speed 
to fit. However, if your blank CD-Rs are rated for a slower speed than 
your burner or if you have problems creating CD-Rs, you can change the 
recording speed setting to match the CD’s rating.

216
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
 Disc Format: The disc format is perhaps the most important choice you 
have to make. Decide whether you’re burning an audio CD (CD-R), an 
MP3 CD (CD-R), or a Data CD (CD-R) or DVD (DVD-R or DVD-RW). Your 
choice depends on what type of player you’re using, or whether you’re 
making a data backup of files rather than a disc that plays in a player. 
Choose one of the following:
 
• Audio CD: Burn a normal audio CD of up to 74 or 80 minutes 
(depending on the type of blank CD-R) using any iTunes-supported 
music files, including songs bought from the iTunes Store. Although 
connoisseurs of music might use AIFF- or WAV-encoded music 
to burn an audio CD, you can also use songs in the AAC and MP3 
 formats.
 
• MP3 CD: Burn an MP3 CD with songs encoded in MP3 format. No 
other formats are supported for MP3 CDs.
 
• Data CD or DVD: Burn a data CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW 
with music files. You can use any encoding formats for the songs. 
Important: Data discs won’t play on most consumer CD players: 
They’re meant for use with computers. However, data discs are 
good choices for storing backup copies of music bought from the 
iTunes Store.
 
 Gap between Songs: You can add an appropriate gap between songs, 
just like commercial CDs. With this option enabled, you can set the gap 
time as well. You can choose from a gap of 0 to 5 seconds, or None. 
I recommend leaving the menu set to the default setting of 2 seconds. 
Albums and song selections that you set to be gapless (see Chapter 
5) will likewise be gapless if you set the Gap Between Songs option to 
None. 
 
 Use Sound Check: Musicians do a sound check before every perfor-
mance to check the volume of microphones and instruments and their 
effect on the listening environment. The aptly named Use Sound Check 
option in the Burning preferences dialog (see Figure 12-2) turns on the 
Sound Check feature to balance your tunes, volume-wise.
 
 Note: This option, for audio CDs only, works regardless of whether 
you’re already using the Sound Check option in the Playback prefer-
ences for iTunes playback. You can select this option for burning with-
out ever changing the preferences for iTunes playback.
 
 Include CD Text: Selecting this option adds the artist and track name 
text to the CD for certain CD players (often, in car players) that can dis-
play the artist and track name while playing a CD.

Troubleshooting burns
Murphy’s Law applies to everything, even something as simple as burning a 
CD-R. Don’t think for a moment that you’re immune to the whims and treach-
eries of Murphy (no one really knows who Murphy is), who, in all his infinite 
wisdom, pronounced that anything that can go wrong will go wrong (and 
usually at the least convenient time). In this section, I cover some of the most 
common problems that you might encounter when burning discs.
The best way to test your newly burned disc is to pop it right back into your 
computer’s drive — or, if it’s an audio CD, try it on a consumer CD player. On 
most CD players, an audio CD-R plays just like any commercial audio CD. MP3 
CDs play fine on consumer MP3 CD players and also work in computers with 
CD-ROM and DVD drives.
If the disc works on the computer but not on a commercial CD player, you 
might have a compatibility problem with the commercial player and CD-R. 
For example, I have a ten-year-old CD player that doesn’t play CD-Rs very 
well, and car players sometimes have trouble with them.
The following list gives some typical problems, along with the solutions, that 
you might run into when burning a CD:
Problem: The disc won’t burn.
Solution: Perhaps you have a bum disc. Hey, it happens. Try using 
another disc or burning at a slower speed.
Problem: In a consumer CD player, the disc doesn’t play or stutters while 
playing.

218
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Solution: This happens often with older consumer players that don’t 
play CD-Rs well, and with some players that are fussy about reading 
less-expensive CD-Rs or certain brands. Try the disc in your computer’s 
CD-ROM or DVD drive. If it works there and you set the format to Audio 
CD, you probably have a compatibility problem with your consumer 
player. You may want to clean your consumer player with CD drive clean-
ers available in consumer electronics stores. You may also want to try a 
different brand of blank CD-Rs.
Problem: The disc doesn’t show tracks on a consumer CD player or 
ejects immediately.
Solution: Be sure to use the proper disc format. The Audio CD format 
works in just about all consumer CD players that can play CD-Rs. MP3 
CDs work in consumer MP3 CD players and computer CD-ROM and DVD 
drives. Data CDs or DVDs work only in computer drives.
Problem: Some songs in your playlist were skipped and not burned onto 
the disc.
Solution: Audio CD-Rs burn with songs encoded in any format, but you 
can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not 
encoded in MP3 — including songs purchased from the iTunes Store 
in protected AAC format — are skipped when burning MP3 CDs. (Any 
Audible files are also skipped because they can’t be put onto an MP3 
CD.) If your playlist for an audio CD-R includes music purchased from the 
iTunes Store, some rules might apply — see the earlier section, “Creating 
a disc burn playlist.”
Studying Files in an iTunes Library
If you like to keep your records properly filed, you’ll love iTunes and its 
nice, neat file-storage methods. For all content items, iTunes creates a folder 
named for the artist and subfolders within the artist folder named for each 
album. These folders are stored in the iTunes Music folder unless you change 
your storage preferences.
Finding the iTunes library
The default method of storing content in the iTunes library is to store all 
media files — including music, videos, podcasts, and audio books — in the 
iTunes Music folder, which is inside the iTunes folder. With this method, 
media files that you drag to the iTunes window are copied into the iTunes 

219
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
Music folder (without deleting the original files). The iTunes folder also has 
folders for mobile applications and album artwork. So that’s easy — every-
thing is inside the iTunes folder.
 
iTunes maintains a separate iTunes folder (with a separate iTunes Music 
folder) in each home folder (Mac) or user folder (PC). If you share your com-
puter with other users who have home folders, each user can have a separate 
iTunes library on the same computer (and, of course, a separate iPod that syn-
chronizes with it). You need only one copy of the iTunes program.
On a Mac, iTunes stores your content library in your home folder’s Music 
folder. The path to this folder’s default location is
your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
On a Windows PC, iTunes stores your content library in your user folder. The 
path to this folder’s default location is
your user folder/My Documents/My Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
Changing how files are 
stored in the library
The default method of organizing files in the iTunes library is to store con-
tent files in album and artist folders, naming the files according to the disc 
number, track number, and title.
For example, the song “Here, There and Everywhere” has the track number 
and song title in the filename (05 Here, There And Everywhere.mp3). 
The filename extension even tells you the type of encoding format — in this 
case, MP3. This song is saved in the Revolver folder (for the album), which is 
in The Beatles folder (for the artist).
Movies, music videos, and TV shows follow similar naming conventions. 
Here’s an example from the TV show Monk. Episode 8 (season 5) is titled “Mr. 
Monk Goes to a Rock Concert.” This information makes up the filename (08 
Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert.m4v), which is stored in the Monk 
folder (the artist) inside the TV Shows folder in the iTunes Music folder.
 
What about songs performed by multiple artists, such as movie soundtrack 
albums and compilations with multiple artists? Compilation and soundtrack 
albums, and songs designated as part of a compilation, are stored in album fold-
ers within the Compilations folder, rather than within individual artist folders. 

220
Part II: Managing Your Media 
Sometimes the information retrieved automatically from the Internet (as 
described in Chapter 9) about a song or album is not to your liking — the 
album might be designated a compilation when it is not, or a compilation 
might not be identified as such. To designate a song as part of a compilation, 
select the song, choose File➪Get Info, click the Info tab in the information 
dialog, and then select the Part of a Compilation check box.
To designate an entire album as a compilation album, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the album and choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The warning dialog appears about editing multiple items.
 
2. Click Yes to the warning dialog.
 
 The Multiple Item Information dialog appears.
 
3. Click the Options button in the top-right corner of the Multiple Item 
Information dialog.
 
 The Options pane for the Multiple Item Information dialog appears, with 
options that include the Part of a Compilation pop-up menu.
 
4. Choose Yes from the Part of a Compilation pop-up menu. 
 
 Even if Yes is already selected for the album, choose Yes again in order 
to set the check mark for updating.
The filename and location within artist and album folders change when you 
change the information for a song (or video, audio book, or podcast episode) 
in the information fields. For example, if you change the song title, the file-
name also changes. If you change the artist name, the folder name for the 
artist might change, or the file might move to a new folder by that name. 
iTunes organizes the files based on the song information.
 
You may want to change song information without changing the names of the 
folders and files. To make changes to song information without changing the 
file and folder names on your hard drive, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) 
or Edit➪Preferences (Windows) and then click Advanced. Then deselect the 
Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized option.
 
Leave the Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized option selected, especially if 
you plan on copying the music files to an Apple TV, or to an iPod or iPhone 
that will then be used with a car installation. (I describe car installations in 
Chapter 17.) Many iPod interfaces for car stereos provide a way to navigate 
the iPod with the car stereo controls but don’t display the proper artist, 
album, and song titles unless the iTunes music folder is organized by the 
default method.

221
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
Maybe you don’t want to store copies of your media files in the library — 
especially if you already have copies stored on your hard drive in another 
location and need to conserve space. If you want to add content to your 
iTunes library without copying the files into the iTunes Music folder, here’s 
what you do:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
2. Click the Advanced tab.
 
3. Deselect the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to 
Library option.
The next time you drag a media file into the iTunes window, it stores only a 
reference in your iTunes library to the file that specifies its actual location. 
The file isn’t copied or moved. Of course, if you move the file, iTunes may not 
find it and may display an exclamation point next to its name in the List pane.
Locating a media file
No matter where you store your iTunes library or your media files, you can 
find the location of any item by selecting it, choosing File➪Get Info, and then 
clicking the Summary tab of the information dialog that appears. You can see 
the file type next to the Kind heading of the Summary tab. The Where section 
tells you where the song is, as shown in Figure 12-3.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Locate a 
media file 
from its 
information 
dialog.
 

222
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
If you access shared libraries on a network, you probably have content you 
can display in iTunes that isn’t actually in your library but is part of a shared 
library or playlist on a network. In those situations, when you look at the 
Summary tab of the information dialog for an item in a shared library, the 
Where section doesn’t appear.
 
You can also open the folder that contains the media file for any item. Select 
the item in List, Grid, or Cover Flow view. Then, on a Mac, choose File➪Show 
in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows, choose File➪Show in Windows Explorer 
(or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives control to the operating system, which displays 
the folder containing the media file. You can show the file if it’s on your hard 
drive but not if it’s in a shared library on another computer.
Backing Up an iTunes Library
Backups? You don’t need no stinkin’ backups?
Yes, you do, so think twice about not making them! I know: Backing up your 
files can be inconvenient and can eat up the capacity of all your external hard 
drives. Still, it must be done. And fortunately, it’s easy to do. With iTunes, 
you can copy your library to another hard drive on your computer or to 
another computer. You can burn as many data DVDs as needed to store all 
the files. 
Backing up to DVD-Rs or CD-Rs
 
Apple provides a handy wizard that walks you through backing up your 
iTunes library, playlists, and iTunes Store purchases to CD-Rs or DVD-Rs. You 
can choose to back up the entire library, perform incremental backups (only 
items added or changed since the last backup), or save only store purchases. 
Choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc and then choose one of the following:
 
 Back Up Entire iTunes Library and Playlist. This might take a stack of 
DVD-Rs (or a truckload of CD-Rs), but it’s worth doing if you have no 
other way to back up your library.
 
 Back Up Only iTunes Store Purchases. This is an essential procedure 
because if you lose these files, you have to repurchase them. You can 
use CD-Rs or DVD-Rs.
 
 Only Back Up Items Added or Changed Since Last Backup. Use this 
method to copy only items that were added or changed since your last 
backup.

223
 Chapter 12: Gimme Shelter for My Media
To restore your iTunes library from a stack of backup DVD-Rs or CD-Rs, open 
iTunes and insert the first disc. Then follow the instructions that appear 
automatically after inserting the disc. 
Backing up to another hard drive
To copy your entire library to another hard drive, locate the iTunes folder 
on your computer (see “Finding the iTunes library” earlier in this chapter). 
Drag this folder to another hard drive or backup device, and you’re all set. 
This action copies everything, including the playlists in your library.
 
The copy operation might take some time if your library is huge. Although you 
can interrupt the operation anytime, the newly copied library might not be 
complete. Finishing the copy operation is always best.
If you restore the backup copy to the same computer with the same names 
for its hard drive, the backup copy’s playlists work fine. Playlists are essen-
tially lists of songs in the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format, with 
pathnames to the song files: If the hard drive name is different, the path-
names won’t work. However, you can import the playlists back into iTunes 
by choosing File➪Import and then browsing for and selecting the iTunes 
Music Library.xml file inside the iTunes folder, which realigns the playlist 
pathnames to the new hard drive.
 
For a complete description of how to copy your iTunes library to other com-
puters and hard drives, including from Mac to PC or vice-versa, visit this 
book’s companion Web site.

Fine-Tuning the Sound
In This Chapter
 Equalizing the sound in iTunes
 Adjusting the preamp volume and frequencies
 Using the iPod equalizer and iTunes presets
S
ound is difficult to describe. Describing how to adjust sound to your 
liking is harder still. Maybe you want more bone-rattling bass, or treble 
highs that are as clear as a bell. Even if you’ve never mastered a stereo 
system beyond adjusting the bass, treble, and volume, you can use this lim-
ited knowledge to quickly fine-tune the sound in iTunes by using the equal-
izer settings, as you discover in this chapter.
Sound studio engineers try to make recordings for typical listening environ-
ments, so they have to simulate the sound experience in those environments. 
Studios typically have home stereo speakers as monitors so that the engi-
neers can hear what the music sounds like on a home stereo. In the 1950s 
and early 1960s, when AM radio was king, engineers working on potential AM 
radio hits purposely mixed the sound with low-fidelity monaural speakers 
so that they could hear what the mix would sound like on the radio. (Thank 
goodness that those days are over and that cars offer higher-quality FM radio 
as well as very high-quality audio systems.)
Engineers did this because the quality of the sound is no better than the speak-
ers you play it on. When you find out how to adjust and fine-tune the sound 
coming from your computer running iTunes and out of your iPod, use your 
everyday listening environment as a guide. If you tweak the sound specifically 
for your computer speakers or for your home stereo and speakers, though, 
remember that with an iPod you have other potential listening environments — 
different headphones, car stereo systems, portable boomboxes, and so on.
Fortunately, iTunes gives you the flexibility of using different equalization set-
tings for different songs, audio books, podcasts, and videos. You can also use 
presets on your iPod. In this chapter, you discover how to make presets for 

226
Part II: Managing Your Media 
songs in your library so that iTunes remembers them. What’s more, you can 
use the standard iTunes presets on your iPod or use other iPod settings in 
tandem with the iPod’s equalizer. This chapter shows you how. 
Adjusting the Sound in iTunes First
Some songs are just too loud. I don’t mean too loud stylistically, as in thrash 
metal with screeching guitars; I mean too loud for your ears when you’re 
wearing headphones or so loud that the music sounds distorted in your 
speakers. And some songs are just too soft; you have to increase the volume 
to hear them and then lower the volume to listen to louder songs. To remedy 
instances like these, you can set the volume in advance in several ways.
Setting the volume in advance
With songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos that you already 
know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting the volume for those items 
in advance so that they always play with the desired volume adjustment. You 
can even set the volume for entire albums or podcasts.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular item in advance so that it always 
plays at that setting, perform the following steps:
 
1. Click an item to select it.
 
 To set the volume in iTunes for multiple songs, you can select an entire 
album in Browse view or you can select all the songs. To set the volume 
for a whole podcast, select it instead of individual episodes.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The information dialog appears.
 
3. Click the Options tab.
 
 Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume lower 
or higher, as shown in Figure 13-1. You can do this while playing the file.
Enhancing the sound
Some home or car stereos offer a sound enhancer button to improve the 
depth of the sound. iTunes offers a similar option — Sound Enhancer — that 
enhances high and low frequencies. Audiophiles and sound purists would 
most likely use the equalizer to boost frequencies, but you can use this brute-
force method to enhance the sound.

227
 Chapter 13: Fine-Tuning the Sound
 
Figure 13-1: 
Adjust the 
volume 
 setting in 
advance for 
a song.
 
To enable Sound Enhancer, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
2. In the iTunes Preferences dialog that appears, click the Playback tab.
 
 The Playback preferences appear, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
3. Adjust the Sound Enhancer slider:
 
• Increase the sound enhancement. Dragging the Sound Enhancer 
slider to the right (toward High) is similar to pressing the loudness 
button on a stereo or the equivalent of boosting the treble (high) 
and bass (low) frequencies in the equalizer. (See the upcoming 
section, “Equalize It in iTunes.”)
 
• Decrease the high and low frequencies. Drag the slider to the left 
toward Low.
 
 The middle setting is neutral, adding no enhancement — the same as 
disabling Sound Enhancer by clearing its check box.
Sound-checking the iTunes library
Because music CDs are manufactured inconsistently, discrepancies occur 
in volume. Some CDs play louder than others; occasionally, even individual 
tracks on a CD might vary.

228
Part II: Managing Your Media 
 
Figure 13-2: 
Use the 
Sound 
Enhancer.
 
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes library 
with the Sound Check option. (Think of musicians, who do sound checks 
to check the volume of microphones and instruments and the effect on the 
listening environment.) The aptly named Sound Check option in iTunes 
allows you to do a sound check on your tunes to bring them all into line, 
volume-wise. This option has the added benefit of applying the same volume 
adjustment when you play the songs back on your iPod, as described in the 
upcoming section, “Sound-checking the iPod.”
 
Sound Check scans the audio files, finds each track’s peak volume level, and 
then uses this peak volume information to level the playing volume of tracks 
so that they have the same peak volume. The sound quality isn’t affected, nor 
is the audio information changed: The volume is simply adjusted at the start 
of the track to be in line with other tracks. If you mix early Sixties music with 
today’s much louder music, like I do, all the songs play at relatively the same 
volume (so I don’t have to adjust the volume) without any loss in quality. 
To enable Sound Check, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
 
 The volume slider is located in the top-left corner of the iTunes window, 
to the right of the Play button.

229

2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
3. In the iTunes Preferences dialog that appears, click the Playback tab.
 
 The Playback preferences appear; refer to Figure 13-2.
 
4. Select the Sound Check check box.
 
 iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the 
iTunes volume slider.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the volume 
slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately the same 
volume.
The operation runs in the background while you do other things. If you quit 
iTunes and then restart it, the operation continues where it left off when you 
quit. You can switch Sound Check on or off at any time.
Sound-checking the iPod
You can take advantage of volume-leveling in your iTunes library with the 
Sound Check option and then switch Sound Check on or off on your iPod 
or iPhone. This feature is useful especially when using your iPod in a car or 
when jogging while listening to headphones because you don’t want to have 
to reach for the volume on the iPod or on the car stereo every time it starts 
playing a song that’s too loud.
 
The Sound Check option on your iPod works only if you’ve also set the Sound 
Check option in your iTunes library. If you need to enable this setting in 
iTunes, check out the preceding section.
With sixth-generation or older-model iPods, choose Settings➪Sound 
Check➪On from the main menu to enable Sound Check. To disable it, choose 
Settings➪Sound Check➪Off. 
With the iPod touch, choose Settings from the home menu, and touch the 
on-off button next to Sound Check at the top of the Music section of the 
Settings menu so that it displays ON. To disable it, touch the on-off button so 
that it displays OFF.
With the iPhone, choose Settings from the home menu, and choose iPod from 
the Settings menu. Touch the on-off button next to Sound Check at the top of 
the Music section of the settings menu so that it displays ON. To disable it, 
touch the on-off button so that it displays OFF.

Equalize It in iTunes
To open the iTunes equalizer, choose Window➪Equalizer. The iTunes equal-
izer allows you to fine-tune sound spectrum frequencies in a more precise 
way than with the typical bass and treble controls you find on home stereos 
and powered speakers. (See the sidebar on equalizers, elsewhere in this 
chapter.) You can use the equalizer to improve or enhance the sound coming 
through a particular stereo system and speakers. With the equalizer settings, 
you can customize playback for different musical genres, listening environ-
ments, or speakers.
 
If you want to pick entirely different equalizer settings for car speakers, home 
speakers, and headphones, you can save your own settings. Learn how by vis-
iting this book’s companion Web site
Adjusting the preamp volume
The preamp in your stereo is the component that offers a volume control that 
applies to all frequencies equally.
 
Volume knobs generally go up to 10 — except, of course, for Spinal Tap’s 
Marshall preamps, which go to 11.
The iTunes equalizer, as shown in Figure 13-3, offers a Preamp slider on the 
far-left side. You can increase or decrease the volume in 3 decibel (dB) incre-
ments up to 12 dB. Decibels are units of measure for the intensity (or volume) 
of the frequencies. Decibels are a logarithmic scale, with each additional 
decibel measuring a logarithmic increase. You can adjust the volume while 
playing the music to hear the result right away.
 
Figure 13-3: 
Use the 
Preamp 
slider to 
adjust the 
volume 
across all 
frequencies.
 
If you want to make any adjustments to frequencies, you might need to adjust 
the preamp volume first if needed and then move on to the specific frequencies.

231
 Chapter 13: Fine-Tuning the Sound
Adjusting frequencies
You can adjust frequencies in the iTunes equalizer by clicking and dragging 
sliders that look like mixing-board faders.
The horizontal values across the equalizer represent the spectrum of human 
hearing. The deepest frequency (“Daddy sang bass”) is 32 hertz (Hz); the 
midrange frequencies are 250 Hz and 500 Hz; and the higher frequencies go 
from 1 kilohertz (kHz) to 16 kHz (treble).
The vertical values on each bar represent decibels. Increase or decrease the 
frequencies at 3 dB increments by clicking and dragging the sliders up and 
down. You can drag the sliders to adjust the frequencies while the music is 
playing so that you can hear the effect immediately.
Using the iTunes presets
iTunes offers presets, which are equalizer settings made in advance and 
saved by name. You can quickly switch settings without having to make 
What’s the frequency, Kenneth? 
The equalizer opportunity
The Beach Boys were right when they sang 
“Good Vibrations” because that’s what music 
is — the sensation of hearing audible vibrations 
conveyed to the ear by a medium, such as air. 
Musicians measure pitch by the frequency of 
vibrations. The waves can oscillate slowly and 
produce low-pitched sounds, or they can oscil-
late rapidly and produce high-pitched sounds. 
Amplitude is a measurement of the amount of 
fluctuation in air pressure — therefore, ampli-
tude is perceived as loudness.
When you increase the bass or treble on a 
stereo system, you’re actually increasing the 
volume, or intensity, of certain frequencies while 
the music is playing. An equalizer lets you fine-
tune the sound spectrum frequencies in a more 
precise way than with bass and treble controls. 
It increases or decreases specific frequen-
cies of the sound to raise or lower highs, lows, 
and midrange tones. The equalizer adjusts the 
volume with several band-pass filters all cen-
tered at different frequencies, and each filter 
offers controllable gain (the ability to boost the 
volume).
On more sophisticated stereo systems, an 
equalizer with a bar graph display replaces the 
bass and treble controls. An equalizer (EQ in 
audio-speak) enables you to fine-tune the spe-
cific sound spectrum frequencies, which gives 
you far greater control than merely adjusting 
the bass or treble controls.

232
Part II: Managing Your Media 
changes to each frequency slider. iTunes comes with more than 20 presets of 
the most commonly used equalizer settings, including ones for specific music 
genres, such as classical and rock. 
To choose an equalizer preset, click the Equalizer’s pop-up menu, as shown 
in Figure 13-4, which by default is set to Manual (refer to Figure 13-3). If some-
thing is playing, you hear the effect in the sound immediately after choosing 
the preset.
 
You can assign standard iTunes presets or your own custom presets to specific 
items (songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos) in your iTunes library. 
You can then enable the iPod or iPhone equalizer by choosing any equalizer set-
ting (other than Off) so that the iPod or iPhone uses the item’s equalizer preset 
for playback. Find out how by visiting this book’s companion Web site.

Equalize It in Your iPod
You leave the back-road bliss of the country to get on the freeway, and now 
the music in your car doesn’t have enough bass to give you that thumping 
rhythm you need to dodge other cars. What can you do? Without endanger-
ing anybody, you can pull over and then select one of the iPod equalizer pre-
sets, such as Bass Booster.

233
 Chapter 13: Fine-Tuning the Sound
Yes, your iPod and iPhone also have built-in equalizers. Similar to the iTunes 
equalizer, the iPod or iPhone built-in equalizer modifies the volume of the 
frequencies of the sound. And although you don’t have sliders like the iTunes 
equalizer, you do get the same long list of presets (except for Loudness) to 
suit the type of music or environment.
 
The iPod or iPhone equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it’s on, so 
you might have less playing time.
To select an iPod equalizer preset with iPod classic, iPod nano, or older-
model iPods, choose Settings➪EQ from the main menu to display a list of 
presets. You can scroll the list of presets and press Select to select one. The 
equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets.
With the iPod touch, choose Settings from the home menu, and choose EQ 
to display a list of presets. With the iPhone, choose Settings from the home 
menu, choose iPod from the Settings menu, and then choose EQ to display a 
list of presets. You can scroll the list of presets and touch a preset to select 
it. The equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets. 
Each equalizer preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to 
enhance the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the 
volume of the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the 
high (treble) frequencies.
 
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, open the iTunes equal-
izer and then select the same preset. The faders in the equalizer show you 
exactly what the preset does.
The Off setting disables the iPod equalizer. You have to choose an equalizer 
preset to enable the iPod equalizer.

specific songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos — and use those 
presets when playing these items back on your iPod or iPhone — by visiting

or a music lover, nothing compares with the feeling of having a whole lot 
of song choices at your fingertips. Rather than sitting back and soaking 
up the preprogrammed sounds of radio or CDs, you can control your iPod 
or iPhone playback to pick any song that you want to hear at any time. Or, 
shuffle through songs to get an idea of how wide your music choices are or to 
surprise yourself or others. You may want to follow a thread of musical ideas, 
such as The Kingsmen’s version of “Louie Louie” through “All Day and All of 
the Night” by The Kinks, “Dirty Water” by The Standells, “Little Bit of Soul” by 
The Music Explosion, The Troggs’ “Wild Thing,” all the way to the version of 
“Wild Thing” by Jimi Hendrix.
In this chapter, you discover how to locate and play content on any iPod or 
iPhone. Note: If you have an iPod shuffle, see the later section, “Playing an 
iPod shuffle.”
With your iPhone, iPod classic, iPod touch, or iPod nano, you can locate 
and play music easily, browsing by artist and album — even by composer. 
Selecting a playlist is simple. And if you don’t have playlists from iTunes 
(or you don’t want to hear those playlists), you can create a temporary 
On-The-Go playlist. You can even create a Genius playlist for your iPod nano, 
iPod classic, iPod touch or iPhone.

Locating Songs
With so many songs on your iPod or iPhone, finding a particular one by its 
song title can take longer than finding it another way — like finding a needle 
in a haystack or even trying to find “Needle in a Haystack” by The Velvelettes 
in a Motown catalog. It may be faster to locate albums by cover art, or songs 
by searching for artist (or composer), genre, album, or playlist. 
By cover art (using Cover Flow)
The iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, and iPhone (as well as some earlier 
sixth-generation models) can display the cover art for albums. The Cover 
Flow browser lets you flip through your cover art to select music alphabeti-
cally by artist.
To browse music by cover art with an iPod touch or iPhone model, choose 
Music from the iPod touch Home menu or iPod from the iPhone Home menu, 
and then hold the device so that it’s horizontal in order to change the dis-
play to landscape mode. The iPod touch or iPhone automatically switches to 
the landscape-mode display and offers the Cover Flow browser, as shown in 
Figure 14-1.

 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
To return to menus and make other selections when playing a song on an 
iPhone or iPod touch, press the left-arrow button in the upper-left corner of 
the display.
Repeating songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over, 
your iPod or iPhone is happy to oblige. (You might want to try repeating 
“They’re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa” by Napoleon XIV, a favorite 
from the old The Dr. Demento Show radio broadcasts — and perhaps they 
will come.) More than likely, you’ll want to repeat a sequence of songs, which 
you can easily do.
You can set your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models) to repeat a 
single song, or to repeat all the songs in the selected album or playlist, by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
1. Locate and play a song.
 
2. While the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to 
the main menu and then choose the Settings item.
 
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
 
 The Repeat setting displays Off, One, or All next to it.
 
4. Press the Select button until the setting changes to One to repeat one 
song, or All to repeat all the songs in the album or playlist (or Off to 
turn repeat off).
 
 If you press the button more than you need to, keep pressing until the 
setting you want reappears. The button cycles among the Off, One, and 
All settings.
 
You can also press the Previous/Rewind button to repeat a song.
The iPod touch and iPhone provide touch buttons to control repeating and 
shuffling. To access these touch buttons, tap underneath the left-arrow 
button or the album title while a song is playing. The Repeat and Shuffle 
touch buttons appear, along with the scrubber bar, directly below the top 
row of buttons, as shown in Figure 14-2.
 
If you’re viewing another iPod menu on the iPhone or content menu on the 
iPod touch, touch Now Playing at the top-right corner of the display to go 
directly to the “now playing” display.

You can repeat an entire song list by tapping the Repeat touch button (refer 
to Figure 14-2). When it’s selected, the Repeat button shows blue highlight-
ing. Touch the Repeat button again to repeat only the current song — the 
button changes to include a blue-highlighted numeral 1. Touch it once more 
to return to normal playback.

Shuffling song order
Maybe you want your song selections to be surprising and unpredictable, 
and you want your iPod or iPhone to read your mind. You can shuffle song 
playback to play in random order, just like an automated radio station with-
out a disk jockey or program guide. See for yourself whether your iPod or 
iPhone knows how to pick good tunes without your help.
The shuffle algorithm is truly random, according to Apple. When an iPod or 
iPhone creates a shuffle, it reorders the songs (like shuffling a deck of cards), 
and then it plays them in the new order. By default, only songs are included 
in iPod or iPhone shuffling. However, you can select podcast episodes, audio 
books, and videos in iTunes and set an option to include them in shuffles. To 
do this in iTunes
 
1. Select the video, podcast episode, or audio book episode.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
3. Click the Options tab.

245
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
 
4. Deselect the Skip When Shuffling option.
 
 The next time you synchronize your iPod or iPhone, any items with this 
option turned off are included in shuffles.
If you want to exclude a song from shuffles, select the song in iTunes, choose 
File➪Get Info, click the Options tab, and then select the Skip When Shuffling 
option.
You can also shuffle songs within an album or playlist, which gives you some 
control over random playback. For example, you could create a smart playlist 
for all jazz songs and then shuffle the songs within that jazz playlist. And if 
you want to play albums randomly, but don’t like when the songs in an album 
aren’t played in proper album order, you can shuffle all the albums but play 
the songs in normal album order.
On an iPod nano or iPod classic
To turn your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model) into a random song 
player, choose Shuffle Songs from the main menu. 
 
On a current iPod nano, you can shake it so that its motion detector switches 
to a random song. Whenever you shake it, the iPod nano shuffles again to 
another random song. Shaking to shuffle doesn’t change your shuffle settings — 
it just immediately shuffles songs. Shaking to shuffle is disabled when you put 
the Hold switch in the hold position (so that you don’t keep changing songs as 
you jog or exercise strenuously) , or if the iPod nano’s display is off. You can 
also disable it by choosing Settings➪Playback➪Shake from the main menu, 
and then select Off. To turn it on, choose Settings➪Playback➪Shake from the 
main menu, and select On.
To shuffle songs in an album or a playlist with an iPod classic or iPod nano 
(or older model), or to shuffle albums, follow these steps: 
 
1. Choose Settings from the main menu, and scroll to Shuffle.
 
 The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
 
2. Press the Select button once (Off changes to Songs) to shuffle the 
songs in the next album or playlist you play. Press Select again (Songs 
changes to Albums) to shuffle the albums without shuffling the songs 
within each album.
 
 When you set Shuffle to Songs, the iPod classic or iPod nano shuffles 
songs within the currently playing playlist or album, or if nothing is play-
ing, the next album or playlist you choose to play. When you set Shuffle 
to Albums, it plays all the songs on the currently playing album (or the 
next album you play) in order, and then randomly selects another album 
in the list and plays through it in order. 

246
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
 If you press the Select button more than you need to, keep pressing 
until the setting you want reappears. The button cycles among the Off, 
Songs, or Albums settings.
On an iPod touch or iPhone
To turn your iPod touch or iPhone into a random song player, choose Music 
from the iPod touch Home menu or iPod from the iPhone Home menu, and 
touch the Songs button at the bottom of the display. The song list appears, 
with Shuffle at the top of the list. Touch Shuffle to turn on Shuffle.
 
You can set an iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle any album or playlist before 
playing it. First, select the playlist or album; and then choose Shuffle at the top 
of the list of songs for that playlist or album.
The iPod touch and iPhone provide touch buttons to control repeating and 
shuffling. To shuffle songs in an album or playlist, start playing a song in the 
album or playlist and then tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album 
title while a song is playing. The Repeat and Shuffle touch buttons appear, 
along with the scrubber bar, directly below the top row of buttons (refer to 
Figure 14-2). Touch the Shuffle button to shuffle songs within the currently 
playing album or playlist.
 
You can set your iPod or iPhone to repeat an entire album or playlist but still 
shuffle the playing order each time you hear it. Start playing a song in the 
album or playlist, and then set your iPod or iPhone to repeat all the songs in 
the album or playlist as described in “Repeating songs” in this section. Then 
set the iPod or iPhone to shuffle the songs as described above.
Playing Podcasts
Podcasts, naturally, have their own menu. Podcasts are organized by podcast 
name (which is like an album name), and podcast episodes are listed within 
each podcast in the order that they were released (by date).
To play a podcast episode, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Podcasts menu. 
 
 Depending on your model iPod or iPhone:
 
• Choose Podcasts from the iPod classic or iPod nano main menu.
 
• Choose iPod from the iPhone Home menu, touch the More button 
in the lower-right corner of the display, and then touch Podcasts.
 
• Choose Music from the iPod touch Home menu, touch the More 
button in the lower-right corner of the display, and then touch 
Podcasts.

2. Choose a podcast from the Podcasts menu that appears, and then 
choose an episode
 
 A blue dot appears next to any podcast that has unplayed episodes. On 
an iPod classic or iPod nano, scroll the Podcasts menu until the podcast 
name is highlighted and then press the Select button, and then scroll 
and select an episode. On an iPod touch or iPhone, flick the list and 
touch the podcast episode. 
While a podcast episode is playing, the podcast name and episode 
title appear. On a color-display iPod and iPhone, the podcast’s graphic 
image — similar to an album cover — appears. To pause playback, press the 
Play/Pause button when a podcast episode is playing. 
Podcast episodes are automatically set to remember the playback position 
when you pause an episode. This feature lets you pause an episode in iTunes 
while you synchronize your iPod or iPhone (as described in Chapter 11). 
After synchronization, you can continue playing the episode on your iPod or 
iPhone from where you paused. This feature also works in the opposite way: 
If you pause an episode on your iPod or iPhone, the podcast episode resumes 
the playback position so that you can continue playing it in iTunes (after syn-
chronization) from where you paused.
 
When you synchronize your iPod or iPhone, any played episodes are deleted 
if you set iTunes to keep only your unplayed episodes. To make sure that a 
particular episode stays on your iPod or iPhone, select it in iTunes, Control-
click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the episode, and then choose Mark as 
New. You can also change your iPod or iPhone synchronization options for 
podcasts. See Chapter 11 for details.
Playing Audio Books
Audio books also have their own place of honor on the Music/iPod menu. 
Audio books are organized by title, with sections, or episodes, listed in the 
order that they should be read (Part 1, Part 2, and so on).
To play an audio book episode, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Audiobooks menu. 
 
 Depending on your model iPod or iPhone:
 
• Choose Music from the iPod classic or iPod nano main menu, then 
Audiobooks from the Music menu.
 
• Choose iPod from the iPhone Home menu, touch the More 
button in the lower-right corner of the display, and then touch 
Audiobooks.

Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
• Choose Music from the iPod touch Home menu, touch the More 
button in the lower-right corner of the display, and then touch 
Audiobooks.
 
2. Choose an audio book from the Audiobooks menu that appears, and 
then select a particular episode to play.
 
 The audio book episodes are listed in proper order for each book. Press 
the Select button on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model) to 
play the highlighted episode, or touch the episode title on an iPhone or 
iPod touch.
While an audio book episode is playing, the book and episode titles appear. 
Color-display iPods and the iPhone also show the book’s graphic image — 
similar to a book cover. To pause the playback, press the Play/Pause button 
when an audio book episode is playing.
Audio books are automatically set to remember the playback position when 
you pause an episode. This feature lets you pause an episode in iTunes while 
you synchronize your iPod or iPhone. After synchronization, you can con-
tinue playing the episode on your iPod or iPhone from where you paused. 
This feature also works the opposite way: If you start playing an episode on 
your iPod or iPhone and then pause, and then you sync your device with 
iTunes, the audio book episode resumes the playback position so that you 
can continue playing it in iTunes from where you paused.
Playing Movies, TV Shows, and Videos
You can play videos from your iTunes library on iPhone models, all current 
iPod models (except the iPod shuffle), and fifth-generation color-display iPods. 
You may have to use iTunes first to convert imported videos for iPod use — 
select the video and choose Advanced➪Create iPod or iPhone Version. 
Videos you download from the iTunes Store can play without any conversion.
 
To learn more about preparing your own videos and converting imported 
videos for use with an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, visit this book’s companion 
Web site. 
The iTunes Store offers an amazing selection of TV shows and movies, includ-
ing movie rentals (see Chapter 4). Check out the NCAA March Madness 
Basketball Championship while waiting in line for tickets to the next game. 
Watch Disney animations with your children while waiting for the bus. Get 
your dose of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart while taking the subway to 
work. Or watch one of my favorites, “Mr. Monk and the Airplane” from the 
Monk TV series, on your next flight.

 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
Video is incredibly portable on an iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or 
iPhone. People are amazed by the crisp, clear picture quality. You watch 
video horizontally (also known as landscape mode) on the iPod touch, 
iPhone, and the current iPod nano — and if you rotate it to the opposite 
 horizontal position, the video adjusts accordingly.
To play a video on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Videos from the iPod touch Home menu, or touch iPod from 
the iPhone Home menu and then touch the Videos button at the 
bottom of the display.
 
2. Touch the title of a movie, TV show, music video or podcast to play it.
 
 The video titles are listed in alphabetical order divided into sections for 
Movies, TV Shows, Music Videos, and Podcasts. 
To play a video on an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Videos from the main menu to select a movie, TV show, or 
imported video. Choose Music from the main menu to select a music 
video.
 
2. Scroll the menu until the title is highlighted and then press the Select 
button to play your selection. 
 
 Hold the current iPod nano model horizontally to view the picture. If 
you rotate the iPod nano to the opposite horizontal position, the video 
adjusts accordingly.
You can press the Play/Pause button on an iPod nano or iPod classic, or 
touch the Play/Pause button on an iPod touch or iPhone, while a video is 
playing to pause the playback. Videos are automatically set to remember 
the playback position when you pause. This feature lets you pause a video 
or TV episode in iTunes while you synchronize your iPod or iPhone. After 
synchronization, you can continue playing the video or episode on your iPod 
or iPhone from where you paused. This feature also works the opposite way: 
If you start playing a video on your iPod or iPhone and then pause, and then 
you sync the device with iTunes, the video resumes the playback position so 
that you can continue playing it in iTunes from where you paused.
 
You can delete a video directly from your iPod touch or iPhone by flicking 
left or right across the video selection in the Videos menu, and tapping the 
Delete button that appears. Your video is still in iTunes but is deleted from the 
device — you can sync the device again to copy the video back to the device 
(as described in Chapter 11). If you delete a rented movie from iPod touch 
or iPhone, it is deleted permanently. See Chapter 4 for more about managing 
iTunes Store rentals.

Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
iPod classic and iPod nano 
video playback controls
The video playback controls on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or fifth-generation 
iPod work the same way as with songs — you use precisely the same but-
tons, in other words. Use the scroll wheel to adjust the volume, as described 
in the later section, “Adjusting and Limiting the Volume.”
To pause playback, press the Play/Pause button while a video is playing. To 
start again, press Play/Pause again.
To skip to any point in a video, press the Select button (twice on older 
models) to reveal the scrubber bar. Use the scroll wheel to move the play-
head across the scrubber bar forward (to the right) or backward (to the left) 
in the video. 
Press the Next/Fast-Forward button once to play the next video in sequence 
(such as the next episode of a TV show), and press the Previous/Rewind 
button once at the beginning of a video, or twice during the video, to play the 
previous video in sequence. You can fast-forward through a video by pressing 
and holding down the Next/Fast-Forward button, and rewind a video by press-
ing and holding down the Previous/Rewind button. If the video contains chap-
ters, you can skip to the previous or next chapter by pressing the Previous/
Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward button — but remember, this trick works only if 
the original video was set up to contain chapters. To start a video over from 
the beginning, move the playhead on the scrubber bar all the way to the left as 
described above, or press the Previous/Rewind button once.
To return to menus and make other selections on an iPod classic, iPod nano, 
or fifth-generation iPod, press the Menu button. 
iPod touch and iPhone video

If the video contains chapters, you can skip to the previous or next chapter 
by touching the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward button. To start play-
ing at a specific chapter, touch the bullet-list button that appears in the top-
right corner — but remember, this trick works only if the original video was 
set up to contain chapters.
Videos are displayed on an iPhone or iPod touch in landscape mode in wide-
screen format. You can also scale the video picture to fill the display or to fit 
within the display. Tap the Scale button (the one with two arrows facing each 
other), or double-tap the video picture itself, to switch from one to the other. 
Filling the display may crop the sides, top, and bottom to give you a larger 
view of the center of the picture. Fitting to the display assures that the entire 
picture is shown, but you may see black bars on the sides or top and bottom. 
To stop watching a video before it finishes playing, touch the Done button in 
the upper-left corner of the display, or press the Home button. 
If a video offers an alternative audio language or subtitles, a Subtitles button 
appears. Tap the Subtitles button and then choose a language from the Audio 
list, or a language from the Subtitles list, or Off to turn off subtitles.
Viewing YouTube on Your 
iPod touch or iPhone
YouTube is the free video-sharing Web site started in 2005 that has since 
exploded with video clips from all corners of the globe. You can search for 
and watch YouTube videos right from your iPod touch (with a Wi-Fi connec-
tion) or your iPhone (with a Wi-Fi, Edge, or 3G connection). You can also 
bookmark videos for later playback, and share videos with others by e-mail.

252
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
Touch YouTube on the Home menu (in either your iPod touch or iPhone) to 
run the YouTube application. A menu appears with video selections; touch 
a selection to play the video. You can touch buttons along the bottom of the 
display to choose the Featured, Most Viewed, or Bookmarks menus; choose 
Search to search for videos; or choose More to see more menus. For exam-
ple, touch More, and then touch Top Rated in the list of menu choices, to see 
the Top Rated menu (see Figure 14-4).
 
Figure 14-4: 
Touch 
More in the 
YouTube 
application 
to show the 
Top Rated 
and other 
menus.
 
After touching a video selection, your iPod touch or iPhone displays the 
video just like other videos, with the same controls (as shown in Figure 14-5). 
See the “iPod touch and iPhone video playback controls” section earlier 
in this chapter for details. YouTube streams the video to your iPod touch 
or iPhone so that you can start playing it immediately. The progress of the 
downloaded stream appears in the scrubber bar; you can wait for the entire 
video to download if you want to play it without any hiccups.
YouTube adds the Bookmark button (a book icon) to the left of the Previous/
Rewind button to bookmark the video, and the Share button (an envelope 
icon) to the right of the Next/Fast-Forward button to share the video.
You can also bookmark or share the video without playing it, and view infor-
mation about the video as well as related video selections. Tap the right-
arrow button on the right side of each selection (refer to Figure 14-4) to see 
information about the video and to use the Bookmark or Share buttons. (The 
Bookmark button doesn’t appear if the video is already bookmarked.) Touch 
the Bookmark button to save a bookmark for the video — the video selection 
appears in the Bookmarks menu for future reference.

Touch the Done button in the top-right corner of the Bookmarks menu to 
finish editing.
To search for videos on YouTube, touch the Search button at the bottom 
of the display. Touch the Search Entry field that appears at the top of the 
display to show the on-screen keyboard. (For instructions on using the 
on-screen keyboard, see Chapter 1.) If the entry field already has a search 
term, touch the circled x in the right corner of the field to clear its contents. 
Then tap out the letters of the search term using the on-screen keyboard. 
Immediately as you start typing letters, video selections from YouTube 
appear below. You can scroll this list by dragging up and down. If a video 
selection appears that satisfies your search, touch it to play it or bookmark it 
without further ado. Otherwise, keep typing the search term. When finished, 
touch the Search button at the bottom-right corner of the on-screen key-
board to close the keyboard and display the search results.
Viewing Photos
You might remember the old days when you carried fading, wallet-sized 
photo prints that sported creases, rips, and tears the more you showed them 
around. You can now dispense with carrying prints because all you need 
is your color-display iPod or iPhone, which can hold up to 25,000 photos. 
That’s a lot!

254
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
Assuming that you’ve already organized your photos into albums and syn-
chronized your iPod or iPhone with photos (see Chapter 11), you can see the 
photos on your iPod or iPhone by following these steps:
 
1. On the iPod or iPhone, choose Photos from the main or Home menu.
 
 The iPod classic and iPod nano displays the Photos menu with All 
Photos and Settings choices at the top, followed by a list of photo 
albums in alphabetical order. The iPhone displays the Camera Roll 
choice at the top, followed by Photo Library and a list of photo albums. 
The iPod touch displays Photo Library and a list of photo albums. Older 
iPod models with color displays show a Photos menu with Photo Library 
and Slideshow Settings choices at the top, followed by a list of photo 
albums.
 
2. On an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose All Photos or an album name; 
on an iPod touch or iPhone (or older iPod models), choose either 
Photo Library or the album name. 
 
 The All Photos or Photo Library choice displays thumbnail images of all 
the photos in your iPod or iPhone. Selecting an album displays thumb-
nail images of only the photos assigned to that album.
 
3. Use the scroll wheel on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod) 
to highlight the photo thumbnail you want and then press the Select 
button to select the photo; on an iPhone or iPod touch, flick your 
finger to scroll the thumbnails, and tap a thumbnail to select the 
photo.
 
 You might have several screens of thumbnails. Use the scroll wheel on 
an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models) to scroll through the 
thumbnails or use Next/Fast-Forward and Previous/Rewind to skip to the 
next or previous screen. Flick your finger to scroll the thumbnails on an 
iPod touch or iPhone. When you select a photo thumbnail, your iPod or 
iPhone displays it.
To view a photo in landscape orientation on an iPod touch, current model 
iPod nano, or iPhone, rotate it sideways. The photo automatically changes to 
fit the new orientation, and expands to fit the screen if the photo is in land-
scape orientation.
To zoom into the photo to see more detail on an iPod touch or iPhone, double-
tap the area you want to zoom into. Double-tap again to zoom out. You can 
also zoom into an area by unpinching with two fingers, and zoom out by 
pinching. To pan around a photo, drag the photo with your finger.
On an iPhone or iPod touch, tap the full-screen photo to show or hide the 
slide show controls. To see the next or previous photos in the album or 
library, flick left or right, or touch the Previous/Rewind or the Next/Fast-
Forward buttons that appear when you tap the photo display. 

255
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
On an iPod classic or iPod nano (or fifth-generation iPod), press the 
Previous/Rewind button to see the previous photo in the album or library, 
or the Next/Fast-Forward button to see the next photo. Press the Play/Pause 
button to start a slide show (see the “Setting up a slide show” section a little 
later). Press Menu to return to the photo thumbnails, and press Menu again 
to return to the Photos menu.
Setting up a slide show
Slide shows are a far more entertaining way of showing photos because you 
can include music as well as transitions between photos. You can display 
your slide show on the iPod or iPhone, or on a television. Your slide show 
settings work with any photo album (or with the entire photo library) on 
your iPod.
 
To find out how to connect your iPod or iPhone to televisions, stereos, video 
monitors, and video equipment, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
To set up a slide show with an iPod classic or iPod nano (or fifth-generation 
iPod with color display), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Photos from the main menu and then choose Settings from the 
Photos menu. (On fifth-generation iPods, choose Slideshow Settings.)
 
2. Choose Times per Slide from the Settings menu to set the duration of 
each slide.
 
 You can select ranges from 2 to 20 seconds. Or, you can select Manual to 
set the slide show to advance to the next slide when you click the Next/
Fast-Forward button
 
3. Pick your music by choosing Music from the Settings menu and then 
choose a playlist.
 
 You can choose any playlist in your iPod for your slide show, including 
On-The-Go or Now Playing. iPhoto lets you assign an iTunes playlist to 
an iPhoto album, and that assignment is saved in your iPod. If you copy 
the playlist to your iPod, it’s automatically assigned to the slide show.
 
4. Select a transition to use between photos in the slide show by choos-
ing Transitions from the Settings menu.
 
 Wipe Across is my favorite, but you can select Cross Fade, Fade To 
Black, Zoom Out, or Wipe Center. Choose Random if you want to use a 
different (and random) transition for each photo change. Choose Off for 
no transition. After you choose a transition, the Settings menu appears 
again.

256
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
5. Set the iPod to display the slide show by choosing TV Out from the 
Settings menu.
 
 You have three choices for TV Out:
 
• On displays the slide show on a television. While the slide show 
plays on your TV, you can also see the slides as large thumbnails 
on your iPod, along with the photo number within the album or 
library, and the Next and Previous icons.
 
• Ask displays a screen requesting that you select TV Off or TV On; 
you make the choice each time you play a slide show.
 
• Off displays the slide show with full-size images on the iPod.
 
6. (Optional) Select other preferences from the Settings menu:
 
• Repeat: Repeats the slide show.
 
• Shuffle Photos: Shuffles photos in the slide show in a random order.
 
• TV Signal: Changes your television signal to PAL (Phase Alternating 
Line) for European and other countries that use PAL as their video 
standard. NTSC (National TV Standards Committee, also referred 
to humorously as “never the same color”) is the U.S. standard.
To set up a slide show with an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings from the Home menu, and then tap Photos in the 
Settings menu.
 
 The Photos Slideshow Settings menu appears on your iPod touch or 
iPhone.
 
2. Touch the Play Each Slide For option to set the duration of each slide.
 
 You can select ranges from 2 to 20 seconds. 
 
3. Touch the Transition option to pick a transition to use between photos 
in the slide show.
 
 Wipe Across is my favorite, but you can select Cube, Dissolve, Ripple, or 
Wipe Down. Touch the Photos button to return to the Photos Slideshow 
Settings menu.
 
4. Select other preferences as appropriate for your slide show:
 
• Repeat: Repeats the slide show.
 
• Shuffle: Shuffles photos in the slide show in a random order.
 
5. Touch the Settings button to return to the Settings menu, or press the 
menu button to return to the Home menu.
To set your iPhone or iPod touch to display properly on a television, choose 
Settings from the Home menu and choose iPod in the Settings menu of your 
iPhone, or Video in the Settings menu of your iPod touch. You can then turn 
Widescreen format on or off (depending on your television), and change 

257
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
your TV signal to PAL (Phase Alternating Line) for European and other coun-
tries that use PAL as their video standard. NTSC (National TV Standards 
Committee) is the U.S. standard and set by default.
Playing a slide show
To play a slide show, follow these steps:
 
1. On your iPod or iPhone, choose Photos from the main or Home menu.
 
2. Choose an album in the Photos menu, or choose Photo Library on an 
iPod touch or iPhone, or All Photos on an iPod classic or iPod nano.
 
 Choosing All Photos or Photo Library includes the entire library in the 
slide show; choosing an album includes only the photos in that album.
 
3. To start the show, press the Play/Pause button on an iPod classic 
or iPod nano (or older iPod), or touch the Play/Pause button at the 
bottom of the thumbnail display on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
 You can also start a slide show when viewing a single photo by pressing 
the Select button on an iPod classic or iPod nano, or by touching the 
Play/Pause button on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
4. If you previously set TV Out to Ask (as described in “Setting up a slide 
show” in this section), choose TV On or TV Off for your slide show.
 
• TV On displays the slide show on a television (through the video-
out connection). You can also see the slides as large thumbnails on 
the iPod.
 
 TV Off displays the slide show with full-size images on the iPod.
 
5. Use the playback buttons on your iPod or iPhone to navigate your 
slide show.
 
 If you set Time per Slide to Manual, press (or touch) Next/Fast-Forward 
to move to the next photo and press (or touch) Previous/Rewind to 
return to the previous photo.
 
 If you set Time per Slide to a specific duration, use Play/Pause to pause 
and play the slide show.
 
6. Press the Menu or Home button to stop the slide show. 
 
 On an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod), pressing the Menu 
button returns you to the Photos menu. On an iPod touch or iPhone, the 
Home button returns you to the Home menu. You can also stop a slide 
show on an iPod touch or iPhone by touching outside the photo image.

258
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
Creating an On-The-Go Playlist
If you don’t want to hear the iTunes playlists already in your iPod or iPhone 
(or if you haven’t created playlists yet), you can create temporary — 
On-The-Go — playlists (not available in first- and second-generation iPods). 
You can create one or more lists of songs, entire albums, podcast episodes, 
audio books, and videos to play in a certain order, queuing the items right on 
the iPod or iPhone. This option is particularly useful for picking songs to play 
right before driving a car. (Hel-lo! You shouldn’t be messing with your iPod 
while driving.)
Queued items that you select appear automatically in a playlist, appropri-
ately called On-The-Go, on the Playlists menu. (To navigate the Playlists 
menu, see the earlier section, “By playlist.”) This temporary playlist remains 
defined in your iPod or iPhone until you delete it or save it as a new playlist. 
If you synchronize your iPod or iPhone with new music and playlists, the 
On-The-Go playlist is copied to your iTunes library and cleared automati-
cally. You can also save any new playlist you create on your iPod or iPhone 
in your iTunes library.
Selecting and playing items 
in an On-The-Go playlist
To select and then play items in your On-The-Go playlist, follow these steps 
for an iPod classic, iPod nano, or older iPod:
 
1. Locate and highlight a song, album title, or audio book. 
 
2. Press and hold the Select button until the menu appears, and choose 
Add To On-The-Go. On older models, press and hold Select until the 
title flashes.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2, adding items in the order you want them 
played.
 
 You can continue to add items to the list of queued items in the 
On-The-Go playlist at any time. Your iPod keeps track of the On-The-Go 
playlist until you clear it, save it, or synchronize your iPod.
 
4. To play the On-The-Go playlist, scroll the Music menu until Playlists is 
highlighted and then press the Select button.
 
5. On the Playlists menu that appears, scroll to highlight On-The-Go, and 
press the Select button.
 
 A list of songs in the On-The-Go playlist appears.

259
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
 
6. Select a song from the list and press the Select button.
 
 The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order you added 
them). Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song you want, and 
press the Select button to play the playlist starting from that song.
If you happen to have an iPod touch or iPhone on you, follow these steps to 
select and then play items in your On-The-Go playlist:
 
1. Choose Music from the iPod touch menu or iPod from the iPhone 
menu.
 
 The Music menu appears with the Playlists and other touch buttons 
along the bottom of the display.
 
2. Touch the Playlists button and choose On-The-Go from the Playlists 
list.
 
 The Songs list appears with a plus (+) sign next to each song, as well 
as an Add All Songs option at the top. If you have only several dozen 
albums, this list is not too long and you can skip to Step 4, but if you 
have a lot more music, narrow your search with Step 3.
 
3. (Optional) Touch Playlists, Artists, Songs, or More to narrow your 
search for songs to add to the On-The-Go playlist.
 
 Touch the Playlists button to select songs from playlists; or the Artists 
button to browse artists to select songs; or the More button to select 
songs from albums or compilations, to browse by genre, or to select 
audio books or podcast episodes.
 
4. Tap the plus (+) sign next to a song you want to add to the On-The-Go 
playlist, or tap the plus sign next to Add All Albums to add all the 
albums of an artist found in Step 3.
 
 As you tap the plus sign for a song, that song is included in the 
On-The-Go playlist, and turns gray in the list so that you know it has 
already been selected. You can choose Add All Albums as an alternative 
if you want to add all the songs for a particular artist — first browse for 
that artist in Step 3.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, adding songs in the order you want them 
played.
 
 You can continue to add songs to the list. Your iPod touch or iPhone 
keeps track of the On-The-Go playlist until you clear it or synchronize 
your iPod or iPhone. 
 
6. Touch the Done button when finished adding songs. 
 
 The Done button appears in the upper-right corner while you select 
songs, just waiting for you to finish. After touching Done, you return to 
the list of songs in the On-The-Go playlist.

260
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
7. To play the On-The-Go playlist, touch any song to start.
 
 The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order you added 
them). Scroll up or down the list to choose a song, and touch the song 
title to play the playlist starting from that song. You can choose Shuffle 
to shuffle the songs in the playlist.
  
 You can also add entire playlists, entire albums, or everything by an 
artist to the On-The-Go playlist on an iPod touch or iPhone. In Step 4, 
touch the the Playlists, Artists, or More button followed by the Albums 
selection to show one of those menus, and then select a playlist, album,

playlist, select the Cancel option.
Saving an On-The-Go playlist 
in your iPod classic or nano
You might want to create more than one On-The-Go playlist in your iPod clas-
sic or iPod nano (or older iPod), and temporarily save them for transferring 
to your iTunes library. To temporarily save your On-The-Go playlist, follow 
these steps:

262
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
1. Select the On-The-Go playlist.
 
 Choose Music from the main menu, scroll the Music menu until Playlists 
is highlighted, and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu 
appears. Scroll to the On-The-Go item. Press the Select button, and the 
list of items in the playlist appears.
 
2. Scroll to the Save Playlist item.
 
 The Save menu appears, showing the Cancel and Save Playlist items.
 
3. Choose Save Playlist.
 
 The On-The-Go playlist is saved with the name New Playlist 1. (Any sub-
sequent playlists you save are named New Playlist 2, and so on.) These 
appear at the very end of the Playlist menu, not in alphabetical order — 
just above the On-The-Go Playlist item. If you don’t want to save the 
playlist, select Cancel.
On-The-Go playlists saved as New Playlist 1, New Playlist 2, and so on, are 
stored temporarily in your iPod until you synchronize the iPod with your 
iTunes library. The On-The-Go playlist is cleared each time you save it as a 
new playlist, so you can start creating another On-The-Go playlist.
The synchronization also places the newly created playlists on your iPod 
classic, nano, or fifth-generation iPod. Hint: They’ll be in alphabetical order 
on the Playlist menu, named On-The-Go 1, On-The-Go 2, and so on. You can 
then rename them as you wish.
Creating a Genius Playlist 
in Your iPod or iPhone
Your iPod nano, iPod classic, iPod touch, or iPhone can also be a genius 
about songs, even when it’s not connected to your computer. The Genius 
button in iTunes (wisely laid out for all to see in Chapter 10) has also been 
incorporated into these devices to create Genius playlists. 
 
In order for Genius to work, it has to recognize the song you select and you 
need to have enough songs on your iPod or iPhone that are (basically) similar. 
As for the mechanics of it all, you do need to set up an account in the iTunes 
Store if you don’t already have one (see Chapter 4), and then turn on the 
Genius feature as described in Chapter 10. Finally, you have to synchronize 
your iPod or iPhone as described in Chapter 11 so that the Genius is activated. 
(You can also add Genius playlists along with other playlists in iTunes to your 
iPod or iPhone while synching.)

263
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
To create a Genius playlist on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Music from 
the iPod touch Home menu or iPod from the iPhone Home menu, and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Locate and start playing a song to use as the “ base” for your Genius 
playlist.
 
 See “Locating Songs” and “Playing a Song” earlier in this chapter for 
details. The Now Playing screen appears when the song is playing.
 
2. Tap the Now Playing screen to see the control buttons.
 
 The iPod touch and iPhone provide touch buttons to control playback. 
To access these touch buttons, tap underneath the left-arrow button or 
the album title while a song is playing. The Repeat, Genius, and Shuffle 
buttons appear underneath the scrubber bar directly below the top row 
of buttons (refer to Figure 14-2). The Genius button is the atom-looking 
icon in the center.
 
3. Touch the Genius button.
 
 The Genius playlist appears, with New and Refresh buttons at the top. 
You can flick your finger to scroll the list. The genius playlist can be as 
long as 25 songs. Touch any song to start playing the playlist associated 
with that song.
 
4. (Optional) Refresh the Genius playlist by touching Refresh.
 
 Refreshing a playlist changes it to include different songs based on the 
same song you played (depending on how many similar songs you have 
in your iPod touch or iPhone). 
 
5. (Optional) Save the Genius playlist by touching Save in the upper 
right corner of the screen.
 
 The playlist is saved in the playlists section of your iPod touch or 
iPhone using the title of the song it is based on. You can synchronize 
this playlist with iTunes automatically (see Chapter 11).
 
 If you subsequently refresh a saved Genius playlist, the saved playlist is 
refreshed and you lose the previous version of it.
 
6. (Optional) Create a new Genius playlist by touching New, then select a 
new song to base it on.
 
 After touching New, the song list appears for selecting a song. Choose a 
song, and your iPod touch or iPhone creates a new Genius playlist and 
starts playing the song, displaying the Now Playing screen.
 
7. (Optional) After Step 6, return to the Genius playlist by touching the 
left-arrow button in the top left corner of the Now Playing screen.

264
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
You can refresh any Genius playlist, whether it was created in iTunes and 
synced to your iPod touch or iPhone, or created directly on your iPod touch 
or iPhone. Select the playlist, and touch Edit in the top left corner of the play-
list screen, then touch Refresh Playlist (or touch Delete Playlist to delete it, or 
Cancel to cancel the operation).
To create a Genius playlist on a current iPod nano or iPod classic model, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Locate and start playing a song to use as the “ base” for your Genius 
playlist.
 
 See “Locating Songs” and “Playing a Song” earlier in this chapter for 
details. The Now Playing screen appears when the song is playing.
 
2. Press and hold the Select button until a menu appears on top of the 
Now Playing screen.
 
3. Choose Start Genius and press the Select button.
 
 The new Genius playlist appears, with Refresh and Save Playlist at the 
top of the list. Scroll the list to see all the songs, and select any song to 
start playing the playlist associated with that song.
 
4. (Optional) Refresh the genius playlist by selecting Refresh at the top 
of the genius playlist.
 
 Refreshing a playlist changes it to include different songs based on the 
same song you played (depending on how many similar songs you have 
in your iPod). 
 
5. (Optional) Save the Genius playlist by selecting Save Playlist (under 
Refresh at the top of the genius playlist).
 
 The playlist is saved in the playlists section of your iPod using the title 
of the song it is based on. You can synchronize this playlist with iTunes 
automatically (see Chapter 11).
  
 If you subsequently refresh a saved Genius playlist, the saved playlist is 
refreshed and you lose the previous version of it.
Playing an iPod shuffle
The iPod shuffle is a special iPod with no display or any controls to select 
specific songs or albums. The idea behind an iPod shuffle is to load it with 
songs in the order you want them to play (like a long playlist) and then play 
the songs in that order or in shuffle (random) order.

265
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
The current iPod shuffle, shown in its dock in Figure 14-6, offers two switches 
for controlling power and playback mode as well as the familiar Play/Pause, 
Previous/Rewind, Next/Fast-Forward, and volume control buttons. (The older 
iPod shuffle offers one three-position switch on the back for playing songs in 
order, for shuffling songs, and for turning off the unit. On the older iPod shuf-
fle, the Play in Order position is in the middle of the switch, and the Shuffle 
position is at the bottom.)
To play songs in the order they were copied, set the position switch to the 
Play in Order position, which is marked by an icon with arrows in a closed 
loop. To play songs in random order, set the position switch to the Shuffle 
position — marked by the crossing arrows icon.
To play songs on a shuffle, press the Play/Pause button. To stop (or pause) 
playback, press the Play/Pause button again. When you stop playback, the 
iPod shuffle status light blinks green for a minute.
To navigate through the songs in your iPod shuffle, press the Previous/
Rewind button (skip backward) or the Next/Fast-Forward button (skip for-
ward). Press and hold these buttons to skip more than one song forward or 
backward (as if you were fast-forwarding or rewinding a tape). You can start 
a song over by pressing Previous/Rewind while the song is playing.
If you set the position switch to Play in Order, the Previous/Rewind button 
skips backward, and the Next/Fast-Forward button skips forward in the order 
the songs were copied to the iPod shuffle. However, if you set the position 
switch to Shuffle, the playing order is randomized first. Then the Previous/
Rewind button skips backward within the shuffle order, and the Next/Fast-
Forward button skips forward within the shuffle order. For example, suppose 
your iPod shuffle plays the 14th song, then the 5th song, and then the 20th 
song. In that case, pressing the Previous/Rewind button during the 20th song 
takes you back to the 5th song, and pressing it again takes you back to the 
14th song. From there, pressing the Next/Fast-Forward button skips through 
the songs in the same order again: the 14th song, the 5th song, and then the 
20th song.
 
To go immediately to the beginning of an iPod shuffle playlist, press the Play/
Pause button three times quickly (within a second).

Adjusting and Limiting the Volume
 
Because an iPod or iPhone can be quite loud when set to its highest volume, I 
recommend turning down the volume before using headphones.
To adjust volume for an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod), follow 
these steps:
 
1. Play something on the iPod.
 
2. While the content is playing, change the volume with the scroll wheel.
 
 A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll with your 
thumb or finger clockwise to increase the volume or counterclockwise 
to decrease the volume.

267
 Chapter 14: Playing Content on Your iPod or iPhone
To adjust volume for an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Play something on the iPod touch or iPhone.
 
2. While the content is playing, touch the lower portion of the display 
and slide your finger on the volume slider.
 
 After touching the lower portion of the display while playing something, 
the volume slider with a silver knob appears in the iPod touch or iPhone 
at the bottom of the display underneath the playback controls (refer to 
Figure 14-2). Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the 
volume, or to the left to decrease the volume.
To adjust the volume of an iPod shuffle, press the Volume Up (+) or Volume 
Down (–) buttons.
You can also limit the highest volume for your iPod or iPhone to be lower 
than the actual maximum. This can help protect your hearing while listening 
to content from sources with different volume levels. 
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an iPod 
classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings from the main menu.
 
2. Choose Volume Limit from the Settings menu.
 
3. Scroll the volume bar with the click wheel to limit the volume.
 
 A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll clockwise 
to increase the volume or counterclockwise to decrease the volume. 
While you scroll, a triangle below the volume bar indicates the new limit.
 
4. Press the Select button to set the limit or press Play/Pause to option-
ally lock the volume limit.
 
 If you press the Select button, you’re basically accepting the new limit 
without locking it, which means you get to skip the next step; you’re 
done. If you press the Play/Pause button, though, that means you want 
to lock this volume limit down, and to do that you need to also do 
Step 5. Locking the volume limit is useful if you want to prevent others 
from changing it (such as your children). However, it also means that 
you have to enter the combination to unlock the iPod (as described in 
Chapter 18) in order to change the volume limit.
 
5. Set the combination lock for locking the volume limit.
 
 If you pressed the Play/Pause button to lock the volume limit, your iPod 
displays the combination lock. For more details about setting your iPod 
combination lock, see Chapter 18.

268
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an iPod 
touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings from the Home menu.
 
2. Choose iPod from the Settings menu of an iPhone, or Music from the 
Settings menu of an iPod touch.
 
3. Choose Volume Limit from the iPod Settings (iPhone) or Music 
Settings (iPod touch) menu.
 
 A volume slider appears with a silver knob. 
 
4. Slide your finger on the volume slider to limit the volume.
 
 Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the volume, or to 
the left to decrease the volume. While you slide your finger, a triangle 
below the slider indicates the new limit.
 
5. Touch the iPod button (iPhone) or the left-arrow button (iPod touch) 
in the upper-left corner of the display to set the limit and return to the 
previous menu, or touch the Lock Volume Limit button to optionally 
lock the volume limit.
 
 If you accept the new limit without locking it, you get to skip the next 
step; you’re done. The lock is useful for locking the volume limit so 
others can’t change it (such as your children). However, it also means 
that you have to enter the volume limit code to unlock the iPod touch or 
iPhone (as I describe in Chapter 18) in order to change the volume limit.
 
6. Set the Volume Limit Code for locking the volume limit.
 
 If you touched the Lock Volume Limit button to lock the volume limit, 
your iPod touch or iPhone displays four squares for entering a code 
number. Touch the calculator-style number pad to type numbers for 
your code, and be sure to make up a code that you will remember! (If 
you don’t want to enter a code, touch the Cancel button in the upper-left 
corner.) For more details about locking and unlocking, see Chapter 18.

T
he World Wide Web makes the world go ’round a whole lot faster than 
ever before. I browse the Web for many different kinds of content and 
services. It’s gotten to the point where I now make travel, restaurant, and 
entertainment reservations, and purchase everything from music, videos, 
books and clothing to electronics equipment, garden supplies, groceries, and 
furniture, all on the Web. I get to track my shipments and purchases, review 
the latest news, check up on the blogs of my friends and associates, read 
novels, view slide shows and movies posted on the Internet, and even scan 
text messages from cell phones — all thanks to the Internet.
And I do all this on my iPhone or my iPod touch, using the Safari browser. 
I no longer bother with a laptop when I travel, because I have access to all 
these services all the time — even while riding the Muni bus into downtown 
San Francisco. In fact, I use Safari on my iPod touch or iPhone to look up the 
Muni schedule and the useful NextBus Stop Selector (www.nextmuni.com) 
that lets me choose a bus line so I can see when the next bus is coming. I can 
also search using Google or Yahoo! — both services are built into Safari, and 
you can always browse any other search site. 
To connect to the Internet, the iPhone can use the 3G and EDGE data services 
provided by AT&T, as well as any Wi-Fi network connected to the Internet. 
The iPod touch connects to the Internet through Wi-Fi networks only. 

270
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
The iPhone and iPod touch can join AirPort and other Wi-Fi networks at 
home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hotspots around the world. When joined to a Wi-Fi 
network that’s connected to the Internet, the iPhone or iPod touch connects 
to the Internet automatically whenever you use Mail, Safari, YouTube, Stocks, 
Maps, Weather, App Store, or iTunes Store.
Choosing a Wi-Fi Network for 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
An iPod touch needs a Wi-Fi network to get its Internet fix — to connect to 
the Web, to gather and send e-mail, to connect to the online store, and so on. 
An iPhone can get its Internet fix through the Edge network offered by AT&T, 
and an iPhone 3G can also use 3G networks, but Wi-Fi is the preferred, faster 
method of getting on the Internet.
You can join AirPort Wi-Fi networks or any other standard Wi-Fi networks 
in offices, homes, and hot spots. Although some public Wi-Fi networks are 
free, others require signing up with a credit card number, and still others are 
detected but locked — you can’t use them without knowing the password. 
The iPod touch and iPhone can detect and automatically acquire a Wi-Fi 
signal you’ve used before, or they can detect one or more in the area and 
present them in a list for you to choose. You can then tap the name of the 
network to choose it. You can also choose a Wi-Fi network manually by 
choosing Settings➪Wi-Fi from the H4ome menu. 
 
When connected to a Wi-Fi network, your iPod touch or iPhone displays the 
Wi-Fi icon in the status bar at the top of the display, which also indicates the 
connection strength — the more bars you see, the stronger the connection. 
To turn Wi-Fi on or off, choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home menu to dis-
play the Wi-Fi Networks screen, and tap the On button for the Wi-Fi setting 
to turn it off (tap it again to turn it on). The list of available Wi-Fi networks 
appears below the Wi-Fi setting. Scroll this list quickly by flicking your finger, 
or scroll it slowly by dragging up or down, and choose a Wi-Fi network by 
touching its name. 
If a Lock icon appears next to the Wi-Fi network name, it means the network 
is locked and you need a password. The iPod touch or iPhone displays the 
Enter Password screen and the on-screen keyboard. Tap out the password 
using the on-screen keyboard. (For details on how to use the on-screen key-
board, see Chapter 1). Touch Join to join the network or touch Cancel in the 
upper-right corner to cancel joining.

271
 Chapter 15: Surfin’ Safari on the Web
To join a Wi-Fi network that requires a credit-card sign-in or account log-in, 
select the network and then use Safari to open the network’s Web page. (For 
more on using Safari, see “Browsing the Web” in this chapter.) The first Web 
page you see is typically the sign-in or log-in page for the Wi-Fi service. Follow 
the instructions in Chapter 16 for entering information to open Web pages 
manually. Your iPod touch or iPhone remembers your Wi-Fi connections and 
automatically uses one when it detects it within your range. If you have used 
multiple Wi-Fi networks in the same location, it picks the last one you used.
If your iPod touch or iPhone isn’t already connected to Wi-Fi, it’s set by 
default to look for networks and ask whether you want to join them when-
ever you use something that requires the network (such as Safari, Weather, 
YouTube, Mail, and so on). You can stop your iPod touch or iPhone from 
looking and asking: Scroll down to the end of the list of Wi-Fi networks in the 
Wi-Fi Networks screen, and touch the On button for the Ask to Join Networks 
option to turn it off. You can still join networks manually, but you won’t be 
interrupted with requests to join networks.
 
You can also forget a network — such as a paid or closed Wi-Fi service that 
somehow got hold of your iPod touch or iPhone and won’t let you move on 
to other Web pages without typing a password. Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from 
the Home menu and tap the circled right-arrow (>) button next to the selected 
network’s name. The network’s information screen appears. Touch the Forget 
This Network button at the top of the screen so that your iPod touch or 
iPhone doesn’t join it automatically. Then touch the Wi-Fi Networks button 
at the top-left corner to return to the Wi-Fi Networks screen. You can always 
select this or other networks manually.
To join a closed network (one that is not listed in the scanned Wi-Fi networks list 
due to privacy or security settings), you must already know the network name, 
password, and security type. Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home menu, and 
touch Other at the bottom of the list of networks. The Other Network screen 
appears, with the name entry field and the on-screen keyboard. Enter the net-
work name using the on-screen keyboard. (For details on using the keyboard, 
see Chapter 1.) Touch Security to select the type of security the network uses, 
and then tap Other Network in the top-left corner of the display to return to the 
Other Network screen. Finally, touch Join to join the network. 
Some Wi-Fi networks may require you to enter or adjust additional settings, 
such as a client ID or static IP address. To change the settings for a network, 
tap the circled right-arrow (>) button next to the selected network’s name. You 
can choose the IP Address method (DHCP, BootP, or Static) and change other 
settings, including the IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Router address. You can 
also tap the Renew Lease button to renew DHCP settings, and choose an HTTP 
Proxy server (either automatically by URL or manually by specifying the server 
name and port number). Because these settings are complicated and beyond 
the scope of this book, ask your network administrator for help. 

272
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
The iPhone also offers Virtual Private Network (VPN) settings, which allows 
for private data communications over public networks. Choose Settings➪
General➪Network from the Home menu. The Network screen appears. Touch 
VPN and touch the Off button for the VPN option to turn it on. The Settings 
screen appears. If you don’t know your VPN settings for the server, the 
account, and the password, or the security settings, ask your network admin-
istrator for help. Then touch the Save button in the top-right corner of the 
display to save your settings (or Cancel in the top-left corner to cancel).
You can also turn the Data Roaming service on or off with an iPhone. This 
roaming service is useful for foreign access to data services, but should 
be left off in the U.S. (or the country of the iPhone service’s origin) to 
avoid unnecessary roaming charges. To turn this service on or off, choose 
Settings➪General➪Network from the Home menu and touch the Off button 
for Data Roaming to turn it on. (Touch it again to turn it off.)
Browsing Web Sites
Safari on the iPhone or iPod touch not only lets you browse through Web 
sites but also lets you add bookmarks and icons to your Home screen for 
convenient access (and synchronize those bookmarks with your computer’s 
Web browser, as I describe in Chapter 19). 
 
You can rotate either the iPod touch or iPhone sideways to view Web pages 
in landscape orientation, and then double-tap to zoom in or out — Safari auto-
matically fits sections of Web pages (such as columns of text) to fill the screen 
for easy reading. You can spread with two fingers to control the zoom.
Entering Web site addresses
If you’ve already synchronized your bookmarks from your computer’s Web 
browser, as described in Chapter 19, you probably already have bookmarks 
you can use to go directly to your favorite pages — see the following section, 
“Using your bookmarks.” 
If you don’t have any bookmarks yet, don’t worry. It’s a snap to browse any 
Web site on the Internet. Just tap out a site’s address on your iPhone or iPod 
touch on-screen keyboard. (For instructions on using the on-screen keyboard, 
see Chapter 1.) For the blow-by-blow account, check out the following steps:
 
1. Touch Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone Home page.
 
 Your iPod touch or iPhone displays the last Web page you visited, or a 
blank page, with the address field at the top.

273
 Chapter 15: Surfin’ Safari on the Web
 
 You can customize the iPod touch or iPhone Home menu screens to 
include your favorite Web pages. See “Adding Web Clips to Your Home 
Menu” later in this chapter.
 
2. Touch the address field at the top of the screen. (If you don’t see the 
address field, touch the status bar at the top.)
 
 The on-screen keyboard appears. Above that is an entry field for search-
ing (with a magnifying glass icon), and above that, an entry field for 
typing an address. 
 
3. If the entry field already has an address, touch the circled x in the 
right corner of the field to clear its contents.
 
4. Tap out the letters of the Web page name using the on-screen keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing letters, the search entry field disap-
pears, and you see a list of Web addresses in your bookmarks or his-
tory list that match, as shown in Figure 15-1. (If you need instructions 
on how to type using the on-screen keyboard, see Chapter 1.) You can 
scroll the history list by dragging up and down. If the Web address you 
want appears, touch it to go directly to the Web page without further 
ado. Otherwise, keep typing the name, including the extension — the 
on-screen keyboard includes a “.com” button, next to the Go button, for 
convenience.
 
 The address in its full form is known as a URL (Uniform Resource 
Locator) and usually begins with http://www. followed by the name 
of the Web site (such as http://www.apple.com). However, you can 
leave off the http://www. part and just go with the Web site name.

5. Touch the Go button on the on-screen keyboard (or Cancel to cancel).
 
 The Go button closes the on-screen keyboard, displays the message 
Loading in the status bar, and loads the Web page from the Internet, if 
the page exists. If you mistyped it, or the page doesn’t exist, you get the 
message Safari can’t open the page because it can’t find 
the server. Touch OK and start again from Step 2.
 
 To cancel entering a Web site address, touch the Cancel button in the 
top-right corner of the screen (refer to Figure 15-1).
 
To stop a Web page from loading if you change your mind, touch the x on the 
right side of the loading address in the iPod touch or iPhone status bar at the 
top of the display. To reload a Web page to refresh its contents, touch the 
magnifying glass icon on the left side of the address field in the iPod touch or 
iPhone status bar at the top of the display.
Using your bookmarks
If you’ve already synchronized your bookmarks from your computer’s own 
Web browser through iTunes or MobileMe, as described in Chapter 19, or 
saved bookmarks of pages you already visited using your iPod touch or 
iPhone, as described in “Saving and Editing Bookmarks” later in this chapter, 
you can go directly to your favorite bookmarked pages.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Touch Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone Home page.
 
 Your iPod touch or iPhone displays the last Web page you visited, or 
a blank page, with a navigation bar sporting various buttons along the 
bottom, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
2. Touch the Bookmarks button — the one that looks like an open 
book — in the navigation bar.
 
 The Bookmarks screen appears with History and other Bookmark folders. 
You can scroll this list by dragging up and down. 
 
3. Touch a bookmarks folder to open the folder of bookmarks.
 
 For example, touching Bookmarks Menu opens the folders and bookmarks 
from Safari on your Mac or from Safari or Microsoft Internet Explorer on 
your Windows PC. See Chapter 19 for instructions on synchronizing your 
computer’s Web browser bookmarks with your iPhone or iPod touch.
 
4. Touch a bookmark to load the bookmarked Web page.
 
 Bookmarks folders have a folder icon to the left of their names, and actual 
bookmarks have an open-page icon next to their Web page names. Touch 
a folder to reveal its contents and touch a bookmark to load a Web page.

Searching with Google or Yahoo!
If you’ve done any Web surfing at all, then you already know all there is to 
know about search engines. They are simply the tool for finding Web sites. Two 
of the most popular search engines out there — Google and Yahoo! — are built 
into Safari on your iPhone or iPod touch. Google is set up to be your default 
search engine, but you can quickly change that. To choose Yahoo! (or to go 
back to Google), touch Settings➪Safari➪Search Engine, and touch Yahoo! or 
Google. Turning one search engine on turns the other search engine off.
 
You can always bookmark any search site, including Google, Yahoo!, and 
many others, and use them by selecting from your bookmarks as described in 
the “Using your bookmarks” section, earlier in the chapter.
Follow these steps to search with Google or Yahoo!:
 
1. Touch Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone Home page.
 
 Your iPod touch or iPhone displays the last Web page you visited, or a 
blank page, with the address field at the top.
 
2. Touch the address field at the top of the screen. (If you don’t see the 
address field, touch the status bar at the top.)
 
 The on-screen keyboard appears. Above that is the search entry field 
(with a magnifying glass icon), and above that is an entry field for typing 
a Web address. 
 
3. Touch inside the search entry field — the one with the magnifying 
glass icon next to it.

276
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
4. Tap out the letters of the search term using the on-screen keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing letters, you see a list of bookmarks in 
your bookmarks folder or history list. You can scroll this list by dragging 
up and down. If a bookmark appears that satisfies your search, touch 
it to go directly to the Web page without further ado. Otherwise, keep 
typing the search term. 
 
5. Touch the Google or Yahoo! button on the on-screen keyboard.
 
 When finished, touch the Google or Yahoo! button at the bottom-right 
corner of the on-screen keyboard to close the keyboard and display the 
search results (the Google or Yahoo! button replaces the Go button on 
the keyboard when searching).
Opening multiple Web pages
Although you can open Web pages one at a time and switch back and forth 
between them (as I describe later in “Moving to the previous or next page”), 
you can also open several browsing pages independently of each other, and 
each separate page can then be the start of an entirely different browsing 
session.
Some links automatically open a new page instead of replacing the current 
one, leaving you with multiple pages open. Safari on your iPhone or iPod 
touch displays the number of open pages inside the Pages button in the 
right corner of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. If there is no 
number on the button, it means only one page is open.
To open a separate page, touch the Pages button in the navigation bar at the 
bottom-right corner of the screen; then touch the New Page button. Safari 
brushes aside the existing page to display a new one. You can then use your 
bookmarks, enter a Web page address, or search for a Web page. (If you 
change your mind and don’t want to open a new page, touch the Done button 
to cancel.)
To close a separate page, touch the Pages button in the navigation bar at the 
bottom-right corner of the screen to display the page thumbnail images, and 
touch the red circled x in the top-left corner of the Web page thumbnail for 
the page you want to close. The page disappears.
To switch among open pages, touch the Pages button in the navigation bar at 
the bottom-right corner of the screen to display the page thumbnail images, 
as shown in Figure 15-3, and flick left or right to scroll the images. When you 
get to the thumbnail image of the page you want, touch it.

Sending a Web page address by e-mail
As I describe in Chapter 16, your iPod touch or iPhone can send e-mail as 
well as receive it. (The iPod touch requires a Wi-Fi connection to do this, 
while an iPhone can also use 3G or EDGE services from AT&T.) So what if you 
want to share a Web page you just found with your friend? Simple:
 
1. Browse to the Web page and then touch the plus (+) sign in the middle 
of the navigation bar at the bottom of the Safari display on your iPod 
touch or iPhone (refer to Figure 15-2). 
 
 A menu magically pops up from the button with the Add Bookmark, Add 
to Home Screen, and Mail Link to This Page buttons, along with a Cancel 
button.
 
2. Touch the Mail Link to this Page button.
 
 Keep in mind that you must have an e-mail account set up on your iPod 
touch or iPhone to send e-mail, as I describe in Chapter 16.
 
 Your iPod touch or iPhone automatically brings up an e-mail message 
ready to finish composing, with the Subject field already filled out with 
the Web page name, and the link itself already is inserted in the body 
of the message. The To and Cc fields are left blank — ready for you to 
fill in.
 
3. Touch the circled plus (+) sign on the right side of the To blank field 
to select a name from your Contacts list, or use the on-screen key-
board to enter the e-mail address. 
 
4. Touch Send at the top-right corner of the display to send the message.

278
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
Navigating by Touch 
After you’ve found the Web page you want, you can navigate its links and 
play any media it might have to offer. You can also bounce around from pre-
vious to next pages in your browsing session, zoom into pages to see them 
clearly, and scroll around the page to see all of its sections while zooming.
Scrolling and zooming 
To zoom into a Web page in Safari, spread two fingers apart on the screen 
(unpinch). To zoom back out, bring your fingers together (pinch).
You can double-tap the display to zoom into any part of the page. You can 
also double-tap a column to automatically zoom in so that the column fills 
the iPhone or iPod touch display. Double-tap again to zoom back out.
To scroll around the page, touch and drag the page. (If you happen to touch 
a link, drag the link so that you don’t follow the link.) You can drag up, down, 
or sideways to see the entire Web page; or flick your finger up or down to 
quickly scroll the page. Use two fingers to scroll within the frame on a Web 
page, or one finger to scroll the entire page.
 
To jump to the top of a Web page, touch the status bar at the top of the iPod 
touch or iPhone screen.
All of these gestures work the same way in either portrait or landscape orien-
tation. To view a Web page in landscape orientation, rotate the iPod touch or 
iPhone sideways. Safari automatically reorients and expands the page. To set 
it back to portrait, rotate the iPod touch or iPhone again.
Following links and playing media
To follow a link on a Web page, touch the link. Text links are usually under-
lined (sometimes in blue). Many images are also links you can touch to navi-
gate to another page or use to play media content.
If a link leads to a sound or movie file supported by the iPhone or iPod touch, 
Safari plays the sound or movie. (See Chapter 14 for instructions on how to 
play sounds and videos on your iPod touch or iPhone.)

279
 Chapter 15: Surfin’ Safari on the Web
 
You can see the link’s destination — without following it — by touching and 
holding down on the link until the destination address appears (next to your 
finger). You can touch and hold an image to see if it has a link.
Moving to the previous or next page
To move to the previous page in your browsing sequence, touch the left-
arrow button in the navigation bar at the bottom-left corner of the screen 
(refer to Figure 15-2). Safari replaces the current page with the previous one. 
If you have just started browsing and this is the first page, the left-arrow 
button is grayed out.
To move to the next page, touch the right-arrow button in the navigation bar 
at the bottom-left corner of the screen to the right of the left-arrow button 
(refer to Figure 15-2). Safari replaces the current page with the next one in 
the browsing sequence. This button is grayed out unless you’ve navigated 
backward to some previous page.
 
You can always go back to any of the pages you visited by touching the 
Bookmarks button in the navigation bar and then touching History. To clear 
your history list on your iPod touch or iPhone, touch Clear.
Entering information with Web pages
Many Web pages have pop-up menus for entering information. For example, 
the NextBus Stop Selector site (www.nextmuni.com) offers pop-up menus 
for selecting the state, the transit agency, and the bus line. To enter informa-
tion for a pop-up menu, touch the menu. Safari displays a list of options for 
that pop-up menu. Select an option by touching it; you can also flick to scroll 
the list of options. 
After selecting an option, touch the Done button. You can also touch the 
Previous or Next buttons to move to the previous or next pop-up menu.
Entering text into a Web site — such as reservation information, passwords, 
credit card numbers, search terms, and so on — is as easy as touching inside 
the text field. Safari brings up the on-screen keyboard, as shown in Figure 15-4, 
and you can type the text.
You can move to the next or previous text field by touching the Next or 
Previous buttons or by touching inside another text field. To stop typing with 
the on-screen keyboard without submitting your information, touch the Done 
button.

280
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
 
Figure 15-4: 
Type the 
text for a 
text field on 
a Web page.
 
After you finish filling out the text fields on the page, touch Go on the on-
screen keyboard (or touch Search, which some pages use rather than Go). If 
the Web page is a form, touching Go automatically submits the form. Some 
Web pages offer a link for submitting the form, which you must touch in 
order to finish entering information.
Saving and Editing Bookmarks
The best way to keep track of Web pages you’ve visited and want to visit 
again is to set bookmarks for the pages. You can then go immediately back 
to that page by selecting the bookmark. Your bookmarks in your iPhone or 
iPod touch synchronize via iTunes with your Safari bookmarks on your Mac, 
or your Safari or Internet Explorer bookmarks on your PC, as I describe in 
Chapter 19.
Follow these steps to save a bookmark:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Touch the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar.
 
 The Add Bookmark, Add to Home Screen, Mail Link to this Page, and 
Cancel buttons appear on the bottom half of the display. 
 
3. Touch the Add Bookmark button to add a bookmark.
 
 The name of the Web site appears in the title field, ready for editing, 
along with the on-screen keyboard. Below that is the actual URL for the 
Web page, and below that, the Bookmarks folder.

281
 Chapter 15: Surfin’ Safari on the Web
 
4. (Optional) Edit the bookmark’s title.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, you can edit its title with the on-screen key-
board. Touch the circled x on the right side of the title field to clear its 
contents, or use the backspace key on the on-screen keyboard to erase 
backward from the end of the title, and type the new title.
 
5. (Optional) Choose a bookmark folder.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, you can choose a bookmark folder for saving 
it; otherwise Safari saves the bookmark in the topmost level of book-
marks. Touch Bookmarks to see the list of bookmark folders — you can 
flick to scroll the list quickly, or drag it slowly. Select a bookmark folder 
by touching it.
 
6. Touch the Save button to save the bookmark, or Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Save button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and 
the Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.
You can also edit your bookmarks and bookmark folders. Touch the 
Bookmarks button in the navigation bar (refer to Figure 15-2) and choose 
the folder to edit, or the folder that has the bookmark you want to edit. Then 
touch the Edit button in the bottom-left corner of the iPod touch or iPhone 
display. The Edit Bookmarks display appears, with circled minus (–) signs 
next to the bookmark folders.
You can then do any of the following:
 
 To make a new folder within the selected folder, touch New Folder. If 
you want to create a new folder at the topmost level, first touch the 
Bookmarks button in the upper-left corner to go back to the topmost 
Bookmarks list, touch the Edit button, and then touch New Folder.
 
 To delete a bookmark or folder, touch next to the bookmark or folder, 
then touch Delete.
 
 To reposition a bookmark or folder, drag next to the item you want 
to move.
 
 To edit the name of a bookmark or folder, touch the bookmark or folder, 
and use the on-screen keyboard to type the new title (touch the circled 
x in the title field to clear its contents first, if you want).
 
 To change where a bookmark or folder is stored, touch the Bookmark 
Folder field for the selected bookmark or folder and then touch a new 
folder to hold the folder chosen for editing.
Touch the Done button in the bottom-left corner of the Edit Bookmarks dis-
play to finish editing.

Adding Web Clips to Your Home Menu
You can add Web Clips for your favorite Web pages to the Home menu of 
your iPod touch or iPhone so that you can access the page with one touch. 
Web Clips appear as icons along with the other Home menu items.
 
To discover how to rearrange the buttons and add multiple screens to the 
Home menu for iPod or iPhone, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
Follow these steps to add a Web clip to your Home menu:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Touch the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar.
 
 The Add Bookmark, Add to Home Screen, Mail Link to this Page, and 
Cancel buttons appear on the bottom half of the display. 
 
3. Touch the Add to Home Screen button to add a Web clip to your 
Home menu.
 
 The name of the Web site appears in the title field, ready for editing, 
along with the on-screen keyboard. The icon to be added appears to the 
left of the title field.
 
4. (Optional) Edit the Web clip’s title.
 
 Before saving a Web clip to the Home screen, you can edit its title with 
the on-screen keyboard. Touch the circled x on the right side of the title 
field to clear its contents, or use the backspace key on the on-screen 
keyboard to erase backward from the end of the title, and type the new 
title.
 
5. Touch the Add button to add the Web clip, or Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Add button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and the 
Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.

names, addresses, and phone numbers with your iPod or iPhone, and 
with the iPod touch or iPhone, use the Maps application to find their physical 
addresses on the map, or send e-mail to their e-mail addresses instantly. 
While the iPod classic, iPod nano, and older models run “extras” (in the 
Extras menu) such as calendars, contacts, and “click-wheel” games, the iPod 
touch and iPhone can run full-blown applications and games just like a com-
puter. This chapter shows you how to use the calendars and contacts extras 
on an iPod classic or nano, as well as how to use the Calendar and Contacts 
applications on an iPod touch or iPhone.
I also cover some iPod touch and iPhone built-in applications that work 
best when connected to the Internet, such as Mail for sending and receiving 
e-mail. (You’d use a Wi-Fi network, as described in Chapter 15, with an iPod 
touch, or you’d use Wi-Fi, EDGE, or 3G networks with an iPhone.) I show you 
how to personalize the Stocks application to check your financial stocks in 
real time, and the Weather application to see the temperatures for various 
locations. This chapter also describes how to use the Maps application to 
find addresses in your contacts list, or any location at all, and even obtain 
driving directions — without having to ask someone out on the street.
With iTunes, you can download iPod touch and iPhone applications 
(including games), and iPod classic and nano “click wheel” games, from 
the iTunes Store (as described in Chapter 4). You can also use your iPod 

284
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
touch or iPhone to browse the Web and play Web games such as Rubik’s 
Cube, Hangman, Blackjack, and many others available for free on appSafari 
(http://appsafari.com). See Chapter 15 for details on surfing the Web 
from your iPod touch or iPhone.
 
To learn how to synchronize your iPod classic or nano with “click wheel” 
games from the iTunes Store, and to play those games, visit this book’s com-
panion Web site. I also explain how to download free and commercial applica-
tions and games directly, over a wireless Internet connection, to your iPod 
touch or iPhone and run them.
Checking Your E-Mail with 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
With an Internet connection, your e-mail is just a touch away — touch Mail 
on your iPod touch or iPhone Home menu. You know when you have incom-
ing e-mail because the Mail button shows the number of unread messages in 
your inboxes. 
The Mail application works in the background with the Internet connection, 
retrieving e-mail without interrupting other things you’re doing with your 
iPod touch or iPhone. Mail can display rich HTML messages, and you can 
send as well as receive photos and graphics, which are displayed in your 
message along with the text. You can also receive Portable Document Format 
(PDF) files, Microsoft Word documents, and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as 
attachments and view them on your iPod touch or iPhone.
Mail displays the Accounts menu listing your e-mail accounts that have been 
synchronized with your iPod touch or iPhone. (See Chapter 19 for details 
on synchronizing, setting up, deleting, and changing settings for e-mail 
accounts.) 
Viewing e-mail
To view incoming e-mail, choose Mail from your iPod touch or iPhone Home 
menu, touch an account in the Accounts menu and then touch the Inbox 
in the account’s menu of mailboxes. A list of incoming message headers 
appears, with the sender’s name, subject, and the first sentence or two of 
each message, along with a blue dot if the message hasn’t been read yet.
 
You can also check e-mail at any time by touching the circular arrow button in 
the bottom-left corner of the account’s menu of mailboxes, the list of message 
headers, or the message itself.

285
 Chapter 16: Using iPod and iPhone Applications
Touch a message header to read the message. You can scroll the message 
by flicking or dragging your finger, and zoom into and out of the message by 
un-pinching and pinching with your fingers. You can also zoom directly into 
a column in the message by double-tapping the message, and zoom out by 
double-tapping it again.
To delete a message, touch the Trash Can button at the bottom center of the 
message display. Mail deletes the message from your iPod touch or iPhone 
(but not from your computer or mail server unless it’s set up that way; see 
Chapter 19) and displays the next message in sequence. You can also move 
to the previous or next message by touching the up and down arrows in the 
top-left corner. You can also delete a message without opening it. In the list 
of message headers, drag your finger across a message header and touch the 
Delete button that appears.
If the e-mail includes an attachment, a down-arrow appears within the mes-
sage — to attempt to download the attachment, touch the down-arrow. If the 
format of the attached file is one of the supported formats (which include 
files that have the extensions .doc, .docx, .htm, .html, .pdf, .txt, .xls, 
or .xlsx), Mail downloads and opens the attachment; if not, Mail displays a 
document icon with the name of the file — but you can’t open it.
You can see all the recipients of a message (except bcc or blind carbon copy 
recipients) by opening the message and touching the blue word “Details” 
in the top-right corner of the message. Touch a name or e-mail address that 
appears to see the recipient’s contact information. Touch Hide to hide the 
recipients.
 
You can add the recipient to your contacts list on your iPod touch or iPhone 
by touching the name or e-mail address and then touching Create New 
Contact (or Add to Existing Contact if you want to add the information to an 
existing contact). Touch the Email button to send an e-mail to that recipient’s 
address. (See the “Sending e-mail” section, later in this chapter.) 
You can also follow links in a message, which are usually underlined in 
blue, and images embedded in the message may also have links. A link can 
take you to a Web page in Safari, open a map in Maps, or open a new pread-
dressed e-mail message in Mail. To return to your e-mail, press the Home 
button and touch Mail.
 
You can manage your e-mail messages so that they stick around in your mailbox 
while others are deleted the next time you synchronize. For example, you can 
move messages you want to keep to another mailbox by opening the message 
and tapping the folder icon at the bottom of the message display and then choos-
ing a mailbox. You can also mark a message as unread so that it stays in your 
Inbox — open the message and touch the blue “Mark as Unread” text next to 
the blue dot inside the message. The message is marked as unread — a blue dot 
appears next to the message header in the mailbox list until you open it again.

Sending e-mail
You can use the Mail application to send e-mail to any e-mail address in the 
world. You can even send a message to a group of people without having 
to select each person’s e-mail address. You can also reply to any message 
instantly.
To send an e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Mail from the Home menu.
 
 The Accounts menu appears.
 
2. (Optional) Choose an e-mail account from the the Accounts menu’s 
accounts listing for sending the e-mail. 
 
 You can skip this step and use the default account for sending e-mail, or 
defer the decision until Step 6.
 
3. Touch the pencil-document icon in the lower-right corner of the Mail 
screen. 
 
 The New Message screen appears, as shown in Figure 16-1, along with 
the on-screen keyboard.
 
4. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To field.
 
 If your recipient is listed in your Contacts on your iPod touch or iPhone, 
tap the circled plus (+) sign in the To field entry (refer to Figure 16-1) 
and choose a contact to add the contact’s e-mail address to the To field. 
You can repeat this process to add multiple e-mail addresses to the To 
field from your contacts.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Enter the 
recipient’s 
e-mail 
address and

 Chapter 16: Using iPod and iPhone Applications
 
 If your recipient isn’t listed in your Contacts or if you don’t know 
whether it is listed or not, touch the To field entry and use the on-screen 
keyboard to type one or more e-mail addresses (use a comma to sepa-
rate each address). As you type an e-mail address, e-mail addresses that 
match from your Contacts list appear below. Touch one to add it to the 
To field. 
 
5. (Optional) Add more addresses to the Cc or Bcc fields.
 
 You can add e-mail addresses to the Cc (carbon copy) and Bcc (blind 
carbon copy) fields to copy others. While Cc addresses appear on mes-
sages received by recipients indicating that they were copied on the 
message, Bcc addresses don’t appear on messages received by recipi-
ents. Touch the Cc/Bcc letters to expand the message to include the Cc 
and Bcc fields; then enter addresses the same way as Step 4.
 
6. (Optional) Change the From: address.
 
 You can change the e-mail address for the sender to one of your e-mail 
accounts. The default e-mail account for sending e-mail is already 
selected; touch the From: letters to display a pop-up menu of e-mail 
accounts, and then touch an e-mail account to use as the sender’s 
account. 
 
7. Enter the e-mail subject.
 
 Touch the Subject entry field (refer to Figure 16-1) to type a subject with 
the on-screen keyboard; then touch underneath the Subject field to type 
a message. Press Return on the on-screen keyboard when finished. 
 
8. Touch Send in the upper-right corner of the display (refer to Figure 
16-1) to send the message.
To save a message as a draft so you can work on it later, start typing the 
message as described in the preceding steps, but before touching Send, 
touch Cancel in the upper-left corner of the display (refer to Figure 16-1). 
Then touch the Save button to save the message in your Drafts mailbox or 
touch Don’t Save to discard the message (or Cancel to go back to typing the 
message). You can find the saved message in the Drafts mailbox of the same 
e-mail account, and touch it to add to it or change it, and then send it.
To send a photo in a message, choose Photos from the Home menu and 
choose a photo for viewing, as described in Chapter 14. Then touch the 
button that looks like a curved right arrow in a picture frame, right there in 
the lower-left corner of the photo display along with the other slideshow con-
trols. (Tap the photo if the controls disappear.) You can then touch the Email 
Photo button to e-mail the photo.
You can also forward and reply to any message you receive. Open the message 
and touch the curled left-arrow button that appears in the bottom left side of 
the message display. Then touch Reply to reply to the sender of the message, 
Reply All to reply to all of the recipients as well as the sender (if there are other 

288
Part III: Playing Your iPod or iPhone 
recipients), or Forward to forward the message to someone else (or Cancel to 
go back to the message). The New Message screen appears with the on-screen 
keyboard, so that you can type your reply or add a message to the one you are 
forwarding. Touch Send to send the reply or forwarded message. 
 
When you reply to a message, files or images attached to the initial message 
aren’t sent with the reply.
Changing e-mail message settings 
and sending options
To change your e-mail message settings and sending options, choose 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home menu of your iPod touch 
or iPhone. In the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen that appears, use 
your finger to scroll down to the Mail section to change your e-mail message 
options and sending options.
In the Mail section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen, you 
can change global settings for messages in all accounts. To set the number 
of messages you can see at once, touch Show, and then choose a setting. 
You can choose to see the most recent 25, 50, 75,100, or 200 messages. (To 
download additional messages when you’re in Mail, scroll to the bottom of 
your inbox and tap Download More.) You can also set how many lines of 
each message are previewed in the message list headers. Choose Preview, 
and then choose to see any amount from zero to five lines of each message. 
To set a minimum font size for messages, touch Minimum Font Size and then 
choose Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, or Giant.
You can also set whether Mail shows the To and Cc labels in message lists 
so that you can determine in advance whether the message was sent directly 
to you, or whether you were sent it as a Cc copy (which still might make it 
important, but at least you know). Touch the Show To/Cc Label Off button to 
turn it on. (Touch it again to turn it off.) If Show To/Cc Label is on, you see To 
or Cc in the list next to each message.
 
If you think you have shaky fingers and might delete a message by mistake, 
you can set Mail to confirm that you want to delete a message first before 
deleting. Touch the Off button to turn on the Ask Before Deleting option in the 
Mail section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen (touch it again to

to turn it off). The Bcc refers to blind carbon copy, and it means that your 
message is sent and copied back to you without your e-mail address appear-
ing in the recipient’s list.
You can add a signature to your messages that can include any text — your 
name, title, phone number, favorite quote, or all of these — to personalize 
your e-mails. Touch Signature, and then type a signature with the on-screen 
keyboard. The signature remains in effect for all future e-mails sent from your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
To set the default e-mail account for sending messages, touch Default 
Account, and then choose an e-mail account. Your iPod touch or iPhone will 
use this account whenever you start the process of sending a message from 
another application, such as sending a photo from Photos or touching the 
e-mail address of a business in Maps.
For details on synchronizing e-mail accounts automatically from iTunes or 
MobileMe, as well as for setting up, changing account settings, and deleting 
accounts manually on your iPod touch or iPhone, see Chapter 19.
Using Your Calendars
Your iPod or iPhone can display calendars from calendar applications, such 
as iCal (Mac) or Outlook (Windows). If you haven’t synchronized your iPod 
or iPhone with your calendar files (as I describe in Chapter 19), you see a 
blank calendar. 
Using Calendar on an iPod touch or iPhone 
Choose Calendar from the Home menu on an iPhone or iPod touch. Your 
iPhone or iPod touch displays the Calendars screen with a list of synchro-
nized calendars. Touch All at the top for choosing to view all calendars 
merged into one, or touch a specific calendar to see only that calendar. The 
iPod touch or iPhone displays the calendar in a monthly view.
Touch the Today button in the lower-left corner of the display to see the cal-
endar for today. Touch the List, Day, or Month buttons to change the calen-
dar view to a list of events, a full day of scheduled appointments, or a month 
view, respectively. Touch any day to see the events on that day, and touch 
the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of the display to add a new 
event (see “Adding Information Manually with Your iPod touch or iPhone” in 
this chapter).

Checking your calendars on an iPod 
classic or nano
Choose Extras➪Calendars on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or older iPod. You 
can choose a specific calendar by name or choose All for a merged view of 
all your calendars. Select a calendar and then scroll the click wheel to go 
through the days of the calendar. Select an event to see its details. Press the 
Next and Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your 
To-Do list, choose Extras➪Calendars➪To Do’s.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on your iPod classic or iPod 
nano calendar alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendars➪Alarms. Select Alarms once 
to set the alarm to Beep, select Alarms twice to set it to None (so that only the 
message for the alarm appears), or select it a third time to set it to Off. (The 
Alarms choices cycle from Beep to None to Off and then back to Beep.)
 
Calendars on your iPod or iPhone are far more useful if you synchronize your 
personal information; turn to Chapter 19 to see how.
Using Your Contacts
The bits of information that you’re most likely to need on the road are phone 
numbers and addresses. An iPod or iPhone can store that stuff (in a Contacts 
format) right alongside your music. To see how to sync your personal con-
tacts info on your computer with the info on your iPod or iPhone, check out 
Chapter 19.
Using Contacts on an iPod touch or iPhone 
To view contacts on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Contacts from the 
Home menu. If you have organized contacts into groups, touch a group or 
touch All Contacts, and then scroll the list of contacts with your finger, or 
touch a letter of the alphabet along the right side to go directly to names that 
begin with that letter. Then touch a contact. 
 
You can also view contacts on an iPhone when making or receiving a call or 
checking voice-mail. Choose Phone and touch Contacts at the bottom of the 
screen. 
The contact list is sorted automatically in alphabetical order by first name 
and then last name, or by last name followed by first name. You can change 
which way the contacts sort so that you don’t have to look up people by 

291
 Chapter 16: Using iPod and iPhone Applications
their first names (which can be time-consuming with so many friends named 
Elvis). Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then scroll the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen to the Contacts section. Choose Sort 
Order, and then touch one of these options:
 
 First, Last: Sorts the contact list by first name, followed by the last 
name, so that Mick Jagger sorts under Mick (after Mick Abrahams but 
before Mick Taylor). 
 
 Last, First: Sorts the contacts by last name, followed by the first name, 
so that Brian Jones sorts under Jones. (Jones, Brian appears after Jones, 
Alice but before Jones, Norah.)
You can also display contacts with their first names followed by their last 
names, or last names followed by first names, regardless of how you sort 
them. Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then scroll the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen to the Contacts section. Choose Display 
Order, and then touch one of these options:
 
 First Last: Displays the contacts list by first name and then last name, as 
in Ringo Starr.
 
 Last, First: Displays the contacts list by last name followed by a comma 
and the first name, as in McCartney, Paul.
Viewing and sorting your contacts 
on an iPod classic or nano 
To view a contact on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or older iPod, choose Extras➪
Contacts from the main menu. You can then scroll the list of contacts with the 
click wheel and select a contact by pressing the Select button.
The contact list is sorted automatically in alphabetical order by first name 
and then last name, or by last name followed by first name. You can change 
which way the contacts sort so that you don’t have to look up people by their 
first names. Choose Settings➪Sort By (or on fifth-generation and older iPods, 
choose Settings➪Contacts➪Sort), and then press the Select button in the 
scrolling pad for each option:
 
 First (First Last on older iPods): Sorts the contact list by first name, 
followed by the last name. 
 
 Last (Last, First on older iPods): Sorts the contacts by last name, followed 
by the first name.

Adding Information Manually with 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
One of the major benefits of using an iPod touch or iPhone is the on-screen 
keyboard, which you can use to enter text, such as contact information and 
calendar entries. (For details on how to use the on-screen keyboard, see 
Chapter 1.) You can also use a combination of touch buttons and the on-
screen keyboard to enter other personal information, such as your stocks for 
the Stocks application and your locations for the Weather application.
Entering calendar entries 
While you can enter appointments and events on your computer and sync 
them with your iPod or iPhone, as described in Chapter 19, you can also 
enter appointments and events directly to the calendar in your iPod touch or 
iPhone, and sync them back to your computer.

You can check your financial stocks in real time with your iPod touch or 
iPhone connected to the Internet, and with an iPhone you can call your 
broker immediately. With either device, you can visit your broker’s Web site 
to make a transaction or e-mail your broker.
To see your stock portfolio on your iPod touch or iPhone, choose Stocks

 Chapter 16: Using iPod and iPhone Applications
Your iPod touch or iPhone also offers a Weather application that looks up 
the current temperature and provides a six-day forecast for any city of your 
choice — choose Weather from the Home menu. In daytime, the weather 
screen is light blue, and at night it’s dark purple. What makes Weather useful 
is your ability to add your own cities — as many as you need — so that you 
can look up the weather in multiple locations instantly.
To add a city, touch the i button in the lower-right corner of the weather 
display for your city, and then tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-left corner 
of the Weather screen. A location field appears with the on-screen keyboard.

Using Maps on Your iPod touch or iPhone
I once had to find my way to a meeting on a university campus that I was 
already late for, and, after driving endlessly around the campus looking for 
the proper entrance street, I touched Maps on my iPhone and was able to 
immediately look up the location, see a map of it, and get directions. Yes, I 
pulled over to the curb first for safety.
The Maps application for the iPod touch or iPhone provides street maps, 
satellite photos, and hybrid street-satellite views of locations all over the 
world. You not only have detailed driving directions available from any 
location to any other location, but in some areas, you can also get up-to-the-
minute traffic information.

Entering and saving locations
To find a location and see a map, choose Maps from the Home menu, and 
then touch the Search field at the top of the Maps screen that appears, in 
order to enter information with the on-screen keyboard. You can type in an 
address, an intersection, the name of a landmark or of a general area, the 
name of someone in your contacts list, or a ZIP code, and then touch Search. 
Or you can touch the Bookmarks button in the Search field to bring up a list 
of bookmarked locations, and touch a location.
You can zoom into the map by double-tapping the map or unpinching with 
your fingers, and zoom out by pinching or tapping with two fingers. You can 
also drag the map to pan around it and see more areas. 
A pin marks the location you’ve searched for on the map, as shown in Figure 
16-2 (left side), with a label showing the address. Touch the pin — or its label, 
or the circled right arrow in the label — to see the Info screen, as shown in 
Figure 16-2 (right side), with the name or description of the location. Touch 
Add to Bookmarks in the Info screen to save the location in your bookmarks 
list, which brings up the on-screen keyboard so that you can type a differ-
ent name for the location. Touch Save in the upper-right corner of the Add 
Bookmark screen to save the bookmark (or Cancel to cancel the bookmark). 
Touch Map in the upper-left corner of the Info screen to go back to the map.
You can also touch the pin or its label and then touch Directions To Here or

 Chapter 16: Using iPod and iPhone Applications
To find your physical location on the map, touch the Compass icon in the 
bottom-left corner of the map screen (refer to Figure 16-2, left side). The map 
changes to show your general location with a compass-looking circle repre-
senting your approximate physical location. The Maps application figures out 
where you are by using information from some local Wi-Fi networks (if you 
have Wi-Fi turned on), or in the case of the iPhone 3G, by using its built-in 
GPS (Global Positioning System). The more accurate the available informa-
tion, the smaller the circle on the map.
To show traffic information, or to change the map to show a satellite image 
(if available), a hybrid of street view and satellite, or a list of locations, touch 
the Eye icon in the bottom-right corner of the map screen (refer to Figure 
16-2, left side), and then touch the Show Traffic option or touch Satellite, 
Hybrid, or List to change the map. If you turn on the Show Traffic option, 
highways are color-coded according to the flow of traffic, with green for 
highways moving faster than 50 miles per hour (mph), yellow for 25–50 mph, 
and red for less than 25 mph. If you don’t see color-coded highways, you may 
need to zoom out to see highways and major roads.
Getting directions
To get driving directions from one location to another, you first need to 
search for or choose a location, as described in the previous section, and 
then touch Directions at the bottom of the map screen (refer to Figure 16-2, 
left side). You can also touch a pin on a map and then touch Directions To 
Here or Directions From Here to get directions (refer to Figure 16-2, right 
side). The Directions screen appears, with the first location selected as either 
the Start or End. 
For example, if you want to get directions from your current location to 
a bookmarked location, first find your physical location on the map by 
touching the compass icon in the bottom-left corner of the map screen. 
Then tap Directions, and in the Directions screen that appears, your current 
location already occupies the Start field. Touch the Bookmarks icon in the 
End field and select a bookmarked location for the End field. You can also 
type entries or select bookmarks for both the Start and End fields by touch-
ing those fields and using the on-screen keyboard, as shown in Figure 16-3 
(left side).
 
You can switch the entry for Start to End (or vice versa) by touching the 
looped arrow button to the left of the Start and End fields (refer to Figure 16-3, 
left side). Using this button you can get directions one way; then touch the 
button to reverse the Start and End fields to get directions for the way back.

approximate driving time appears at the top of the Overview screen. If traffic 
data is available, the driving time is adjusted accordingly, but don’t expect 
miracles — the information depends on data collected and services provided 
by third parties, not by Apple, and traffic patterns change. 
To view directions one step at a time on the map, touch Start in the upper-right 
corner of the Overview screen (refer to Figure 16-3, right side) to see the first 
leg of the journey, and then touch the right-arrow button in the upper-right

You can truly go anywhere with an iPod or iPhone. If you can’t plug your 
iPod or iPhone into a power source while it’s playing, you can use the 
battery for quite a while before having to recharge. You can find all the acces-
sories that you need to travel with an iPod or iPhone in the Apple Store at 
www.apple.com.
Put on “Eight Miles High” by the Byrds while cruising in a plane at 40,000 feet. 
Watch the “Lust for Life” music video by Iggy Pop on a bus heading out of 
Detroit. Ride the rails listening to “All Aboard” by Muddy Waters, followed by 
“Peavine” by John Lee Hooker. Or cruise on the Autobahn in Germany with 
Kraftwerk. The iPod or iPhone provides high-quality sound and excellent pic-
ture quality no matter how turbulent the environment.
All current iPod and iPhone models except the iPod classic use flash memory 
drives that play content without skipping even when jostled and thrown 
about. Any movement on your part doesn’t affect playback (but please don’t 
drop them). The iPod classic uses a hard drive, but it also has a memory 
cache — a nice little slice of solid-state memory, with no mechanical or 
moving parts. The fact that the iPod classic actually plays sound from its 
memory cache rather than from its hard drive means you can hop, skip, and 
jump as much as you want, and your listening and/or viewing experience 
won’t be impacted. With all iPods and iPhones you essentially have skip pro-
tection, which means you don’t have to worry about tremors, potholes, or 
strenuous exercise causing the audio to skip.

Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
Connecting Headphones 
and Portable Speakers
Apple designed the iPod and iPhone to provide excellent sound through 
headphones. From the headphone/line-out connection, though, the iPod or 
iPhone can also play music through portable speaker systems. The speaker 
systems must be self-powered or able to work with very little power (like 
headphones) and allow audio to be input via a 3.5mm, stereo mini-plug 
connection.
Looking at specs, you’ll notice that iPod and iPhone models include a small 
amplifier that’s plenty powerful enough to deliver audio through the head-
phone/line-out connection. All current models, including the iPod shuffle, 
have a frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz (hertz), which provides distortion-
free music at the lowest or highest pitches. (In this case, hertz has nothing 
to do with rental cars. A hertz is a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per 
second.) At pitches that produce frequencies of 20 cycles per second or 
20,000 cycles per second, the iPod or iPhone responds with distortion-free 
sound.
 
If headphones aren’t your thing, you can even wear an iPod shuffle inside a 
headband (and keep it relatively dry no matter how much you, um, create 
your own moisture). Thanko (http://thanko.jp/voniasports) offers 
the Vonia sports headband that uses bone conduction — a hearing aid technol-
ogy that conducts “Good Vibrations” through the bones of your skull, directly 
into your inner ear. The sound can be surprisingly clear and crisp, although it 
won’t be in stereo because the sound seems to come from inside your head.
Portable speaker systems typically include built-in amplifiers and a volume 
control, and they usually offer a stereo mini-plug that you can attach directly 
to the iPod or iPhone headphone/line-out connection or to a dock head-
phone/line-out connection. (Some portable speaker systems, such as the 
iBoom Travel or DLO Portable Speakers from DLO [www.dlo.com], or the 
Bose SoundDock Portable [www.bose.com], provide a convenient dock con-
nection for playing audio.) To place the external speakers farther away from 
the iPod or iPhone, use a stereo mini-plug extension cable, which is available 
at most consumer electronics stores. These cables have a stereo mini-plug on 
one end and a stereo mini-socket on the other.
 
Portable speaker systems typically have volume controls. Set your iPod or 
iPhone volume to about half or three-quarters, and then raise or lower the 
volume of your speaker system.

307
 Chapter 17: Going Mobile
When you travel, take an extra pair of headphones (or earbuds) and a splitter 
cable, which are available in any consumer electronics store. The Monster 
iSplitter is available in the Apple Store. That way, you can share music with 
someone on the road.
 
For a portable stereo system that offers big sound on a rechargeable battery 
and is perfect for environments like the beach or a boat, check out the i-Fusion 
or i-P23 speaker systems from Sonic Impact (www.si5.com). (See Figure 
17-1.) The i-Fusion includes universal adapters for all dockable iPod models 
and an audio input connection for connecting your computer or an audio 
player. The double-duty case is a durable cover that acts as a speaker cabinet 
for both speakers, to give the speakers better bass response.

Playing Car Tunes
I always wanted to be able to fill up a car with music just as easily as filling 
it up with fuel, without having to carry dozens of cassettes or CDs. With 
an iPod or iPhone, an auto-charger to save on battery power, and a way 
to connect the iPod or iPhone to your car’s stereo system, you’re ready to 

308
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
pump music. (Start your engine and queue up “Getting in Tune” and then 
“Going Mobile” by The Who.) You can even go one step further and get a new 
BMW, Toyota, or similarly equipped car that offers an iPod or iPhone dock 
cable installed and integrated into the car’s stereo system so that you can 
control the iPod or iPhone from your car stereo — including controls on the 
steering wheel.
Here are your options when it comes to linking your iPod or iPhone to a car 
stereo:
 
 Use your cassette player. Use a standard cassette adapter and an iPod 
power adapter for your car’s lighter socket. This method works even 
with rental cars (as long as they’re supplied with cassette players). For a 
semi-permanent installation, you can add a car mount to keep your iPod 
or iPhone secure. Cassette adapters offer medium quality that’s usually 
better than wireless adapters.
 
 Buy or lease a car that offers an iPod-ready stereo. BMW, Mercedes-
Benz, Toyota, Honda, and many other auto companies offer models that 
are iPod-ready, and you can use your iPhone with them.
 
 Use your radio and a wireless adapter. Use a wireless adapter that plays 
your iPod or iPhone as if it were a station on your FM radio dial. Some 
car mounts offer built-in wireless adapters. This might be your only inex-
pensive choice if you don’t have a cassette deck. Note: Wireless adapters 
might not work well in cities where FM stations crowd the radio dial.
 
 Install an iPod/iPhone interface. Install an iPod or iPhone interface for 
your car stereo that offers high-quality, line-in audio input and power. 
After you install this interface, thread the iPod/iPhone dock cable into the 
glove box so that you can plug the cable into your iPod or iPhone, hide 
the iPod or iPhone in the glove box, and control the iPod or iPhone from 
your car stereo’s head unit. This method offers the best sound quality. 
Toyota offers an integration kit for plugging an iPod into the car glove box 
and using either the steering wheel or usual audio system controls.
Unfortunately, not many car stereos offer a mini-socket for audio input. As 
of this writing, the few accessories that integrate directly with car stereos 
require custom car installations. Most connection standards are based on 
specific car models or stereo models. But stay iTuned, because standard car 
docks are on the horizon.
Using cassette and power 
adapters for your car
Until you get an iPod-ready car, a car stereo with a mini-socket for stereo 
audio input (also called stereo-in connection), or an iPod connection — or get 
one installed — you can use a cassette-player adapter to connect with your 

309
 Chapter 17: Going Mobile
car stereo. (I describe wireless connectivity later, in the section “Connecting 
by Wireless Radio.”) These solutions provide lower sound quality than iPod 
interface installations or stereo-in connections but are inexpensive and work 
with most cars.
Many car stereos have a cassette player, and you can buy a cassette adapter 
from most consumer electronics stores or from the Apple Store (such as the 
Sony CPA-9C Car Cassette Adapter). The cassette-player adapter looks like a 
tape cassette with a mini-plug cable (which sticks out through the slot when 
you’re using the adapter). Adapters work with most front-loading and side-
loading cassette decks — it’s the same shape as a cassette — as long as the 
cable doesn’t prevent its loading. 
First connect the mini-plug cable directly to the iPod or iPhone. Then insert 
the adapter into the cassette player, being careful not to get the cable tangled 
up inside the player.
One inherent problem with this approach is that the cable that dangles from 
your cassette player looks unsightly. You also might have some trouble eject-
ing the adapter if the cable gets wedged in the cassette player door. Overall, 
though, this method is the best for most cars because it provides better 
sound quality than most wireless methods.
Although some new vehicles (particularly SUVs and cars such as the Toyota 
Matrix mini-station wagon) offer 110-volt power outlets you can use with your 
Apple-supplied battery charger, most cars offer only a lighter/power socket 
that requires a power adapter to use with your iPod or iPhone. Be careful to 
pick the right type of power adapter for your car’s lighter/power socket.
Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers the Auto Kit for $49.95, and it includes 
a car power adapter with a convenient socket for a stereo mini-plug cable 
(which can connect directly to a car stereo if the stereo has a mini-socket for 
audio input). The adapter includes a volume-adjustable amplifier to boost 
the sound coming from the iPod or iPhone before it goes into the cassette 
adapter or car stereo.
Even with a cassette adapter and power adapter, you have at best a clumsy 
solution that uses one cable (power) from a power adapter to the iPod 
or iPhone, and another cable (audio) to your car stereo cassette adapter. 
Attached to these wires, your iPod or iPhone needs a secure place to sit 
while your car moves because you don’t want it bouncing around.
You can fit your iPod or iPhone securely in position in a car without getting 
a custom installation. The TuneDok ($30) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) 
holds your iPod or iPhone securely and fits into your car’s cup holder. The 
TuneDok ratcheting neck and height-adjustment feature lets you reposition 
the iPod or iPhone to your liking. The cable-management clip eliminates 
loose and tangled cables, and the large and small rubber base and cup fits 
most cup holders.

310
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers an inexpensive solution for both car 
use and personal use. The $6 Car Holder attaches to the dashboard of your 
car and lets you attach an iPod or iPhone that’s wearing one of the MARWARE 
Sportsuit covering cases. (See “Dressing Up Your iPod and iPhone for Travel,” 
later in this chapter.) The clip on the back attaches to the Car Holder.
ProClip (www.proclipusa.com) offers mounting brackets for clip-on 
devices. The brackets attach to the dashboard, and you can install them in 
seconds. After you install the bracket, you can use different custom holders 
for the iPod or iPhone models or for cell phones and other portable devices.
Integrating an iPod or iPhone 
with your car stereo
Premium car manufacturers are introducing cars that are iPod-ready: includ-
ing an iPod interface for the car stereo system that uses the dock connector 
cable compatible with all iPod and iPhone models except the iPod shuffle. For 
example, BMW offers such a model with audio controls on the steering wheel. 
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Mini-Cooper, Nissan, Alfa Romeo, and Ferrari all also offer 
iPod-ready models. In addition, car stereo manufacturers (such as Alpine and 
Clarion) offer car audio systems with integrated iPod interfaces; see Figure 17-2.

311
 Chapter 17: Going Mobile
If you can’t afford an iPod-ready car, you can opt for a custom installation of 
an iPod interface for your existing car stereo and car power (such as using 
a custom cable interface for a CD changer, which a skilled car audio special-
ist can install in your dashboard). For example, you can order a professional 
installation with the Dension ICE-Link, which adds line-level audio output 
and recharging capability to almost any vehicle. It uses the CD-changer con-
nections in car CD players to directly connect your iPod into the car’s audio 
system. Dension (www.dension.com) assumes that the buyer is a profes-
sional installer. Although you can install it yourself (especially if you already 
have a CD changer unit in your trunk), most installations require taking apart 
the dashboard and installing the ICE-Link behind your CD stereo. ICE-Link can 
be combined with almost any iPod mount. Dension also offers the Gateway 
series of products for controlling iPod and iPhone models and auxiliary 
devices in a car.
If your car stereo doesn’t offer a CD changer interface, you might want to 
have a new car stereo professionally installed that offers a CD changer inter-
face or iPod capability — such as the Alpine CDA-9887 (www.alpine-usa.
com/driveyouripod). With an integrated iPod setup, you can control the 
iPod from the car stereo’s head unit or steering wheel controls. The car 
stereo provides power to the iPod to keep it fully charged.
Connecting by Wireless Radio
A wireless music adapter lets you play music from your iPod or iPhone on 
an FM radio with no connection or cable. However, the sound quality might 
suffer a bit from radio interference. I always take a wireless adapter with 
me whenever I rent a car because even if a rental car has no cassette player 
(ruling out the use of my cassette adapter), it probably has an FM radio.
 
You can use a wireless adapter in a car, on a boat, on the beach with a por-
table radio, or even in your home with a stereo system and tuner. I even use it 
in hotel rooms with a clock radio.
To use a wireless adapter, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the wireless adapter to an unused FM radio frequency.
 
 Some adapters offer only one frequency (typically 87.9 MHz). Others 
offer you a choice of several frequencies: typically 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 
88.7 MHz. Some even let you pick any FM frequency. If given a choice, 
choose the frequency and set the adapter according to its instructions. 
Be sure to pick an unused frequency — a frequency that’s being used by 
an FM station in range of your radio interferes with your iPod signal.

312
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
 
2. Connect the wireless adapter to the iPod or iPhone headphone/line-
out connector or to the line-out connector on an iPod car dock.
 
 The wireless adapter acts like a miniature radio station, broadcasting to 
a nearby FM radio. (Sorry, you can’t go much farther than a few feet, so 
no one else can hear your Wolfman Jack impersonation.)
 
3. Tune to the appropriate frequency on the FM dial.
 
 Tune any nearby radio to the same FM frequency that you chose in Step 1.
 
You need to set the adapter close enough to the radio’s antenna to work, 
making it impractical for home stereos. You can get better quality sound by 
connecting to a home stereo with a cable.
 
Don’t be surprised if the wireless adapter doesn’t work as well in cities — 
other radio stations might cause too much interference.
Here are a few wireless adapters I have no trouble recommending:
 
 TRAFFICJamz ($35) from Newer Technology (www.newertech.com) is 
both a charger and a transmitter that works with all model iPods.
 
 iTrip ($50) from Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.com) 
offers selectable modes of broadcasting — in LX mode, the iTrip trans-
mits in stereo with a fuller sound, whereas DX mode provides a stronger 
mono signal that works in areas with a lot of interference from FM radio 
stations. Even in large cities with lots of radio stations crowding the dial, 
iTrip in DX mode delivers a background noise level below that of a cas-
sette tape adapter for higher-quality sound.
 
 TuneCast 3 Mobile FM Transmitter ($40) from Belkin (www.belkin.
com) is particularly convenient in a car because it includes a 14-inch 
cable that delivers power when used with the Belkin Mobile Power 
Cord for iPod. That way, you can preserve your batteries for when 
you’re not near an alternative source. It offers four programmable 
memory slots for saving the clearest radio frequency wherever 
you go.
 
 Monster iCarPlay Wireless ($79.95) from Monster Cable (www.
monstercable.com) offers a power adapter as well as excellent 
quality playback for a wireless radio unit. You can select radio frequen-
cies of 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7, 88.9, 89.1, 89.3, or 89.5 MHz. Although a bit 
more expensive, I prefer it for its sound quality.
 
 DLO TransDock Classic ($80) from Digital Lifestyle Outfitters (www.
dlo.com) is an excellent all-in-one wireless FM transmitter, mounting 
system, and power adapter for using your iPod in a car. DLO also offers 
the new TransDock ($100) that offers all of the above plus Audio/Video 
Output for showing iPod or iPhone content on a mobile video system or 
using it with cassette adapters and car audio inputs.

Dressing Up Your iPod 
and iPhone for Travel
The simple protective carrying cases supplied with some iPod and iPhone 
models just aren’t as stylin’ as the myriad accessories that you can get for 
dressing up your iPods and iPhones for travel. You can find different types 
of protective gear, from leather jackets to aluminum cases, in many different 
styles and colors. Apple offers access to hundreds of products from other 
suppliers on its accessories page (www.apple.com/ipod/accessories.
html) — click the See More in the Store button to go directly to Apple’s 
online store to view product details and make purchases. Some are designed 
primarily for protecting your iPod from harm; others are designed to provide 
some measure of protection while also providing access to controls. 
On the extreme end of the spectrum are hardened cases that are ready for 
battlefields in deserts or jungles — the Humvees of iPod protective gear, if 
you will. Matias Corporation (http://matias.ca/armor) offers versions 
of the sturdy Matias Armor case ($39.95) for each iPod and iPhone model, 
which offers possibly the best protection against physical trauma on the 
market. Your iPod or iPhone rests within a hard, resilient metal exoskeleton 
that can withstand the abuse of bouncing down a flight of metal stairs with-
out letting your iPod or iPhone pop out. 
Business travelers can combine personal items into one carrying case. The 
Leather Folio ($30) cases from Belkin (www.belkin.com) for iPod classic 
and iPod touch models are made from fine-grain leather that even Ricardo 
Montalban would rave about. The cases can also hold personal essentials, 
such as business and credit cards. The HipCase cases ($30) from DLO (www.
dlo.com) let you stash credit cards and other essentials along with your 
iPod, and the HipCase includes a sturdy, leather-covered belt clip.
On the sporty side, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers the Sportsuit 
Convertible cases ($35) for iPod and iPhone models, with a patented belt-clip 
system, offering interchangeable clip options for use with the MARWARE Car 
Holder or with an armband or belt. The neoprene case has vulcanized rubber 
grips on each side and bottom for a no-slip grip as well as plastic inserts for 
impact protection, offering full access to all of the device’s controls and con-
nections while it’s in the case. 
If you like to carry a backpack with everything in it, consider getting the 
very first backpack ever designed to control an iPod within it: The Burton 
Amp Pack (http://lonelyplanet.altrec.com/shop/detail/24004), 
priced at $239.95, lets you switch songs on your iPod by pressing a button 
on the shoulder strap. Constructed from ballistic nylon, the Amp Pack offers 
a secure iPod storage pocket, a headphone port located on a shoulder strap, 

314
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
an easy-access side entry laptop compartment, and padded ergonomic shoul-
der straps with a soft and flexible control pad built in to a strap. It’s perfect 
for listening to Lou Reed while hanging on to a pole in a subway car, or the 
Hollies while navigating your way to the back of the bus. Other backpacks 
that can host iPods include the JanSport Thundervolt ($90) from Dom’s 
Outdoor Outfitters (http://domsoutdoor.com) and the aptly named 
G-Tech Psycho (www.g-techworld.com).
Using Power Accessories
If you want to charge your iPod battery when you travel abroad, you can’t 
count on finding the same voltage as in your home country. However, you 
still need to use your Apple power adapter, or your computer, to recharge 
your iPod — you need to plug something into some outlet somewhere. 
Fortunately, power converters for different voltages and plugs for different 
outlets are available in most airport gift shops, but the worldly traveler might 
want to consider saving time and money by getting a travel kit of power 
accessories from the Apple Store or from a consumer electronics store.
I found several varieties of power converter kits for world travel in my local 
international airport, but they were pricey — check your local Radio Shack 
or consumer electronics store first, or try Amazon.com. Most kits include 
a set of AC plugs with prongs that fit different electrical outlets around the 
world. You can connect your iPod power adapter to these adapters. The AC 
plugs typically support outlets in North America, Japan, China, the United 
Kingdom, Continental Europe, Korea, Australia, and Hong Kong. You should 
also include at least one power accessory for use with a standard car lighter, 
such as car chargers from Belkin (www.belkin.com), Kensington (www.
kensington.com), or Newer Technology (www.newertech.com).
One way to mitigate the battery blues is to get an accessory that lets you 
use replaceable alkaline batteries — the kind that you can find in any con-
venience store — in a pinch. The TunePower Rechargeable Battery Pack for 
iPod ($80) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) lets you power an iPod Classic or 
older-model iPod with standard AA alkaline replaceable batteries even when 
your internal iPod battery is drained.
 
Another way to supply power to your iPod or iPhone on the road is to use 
your FireWire- or USB 2.0–equipped laptop to supply the power and then use a 
power adapter with your laptop. (Make sure that you use FireWire or USB 2.0 
hardware that provides power; see Chapter 1.) You can use, for example, the 
Kensington Universal Car/Air Adapter for Apple to plug a Mac PowerBook or 
MacBook into any car cigarette lighter or EmPower-equipped airline seat. (The 
EmPower in-seat power system can provide either 110-volt AC or 15-volt DC 
power in an aircraft seat for passenger use.) Then connect the iPod or iPhone 
to the laptop with its USB 2.0 dock connector cable.

E
ven if you purchased an iPod simply to listen to music or watch videos, 
those thoughtful engineers at Apple crammed a lot more features into 
their invention. Your iPod also keeps time, as does your iPhone. You can use 
the iPod or iPhone time-keeper to help you keep track of your personal life by 
setting alarms, using the stopwatch, setting the date and time, using the sleep 
timer to fall asleep to music, and displaying clocks of different time zones. 
And if you think your iPod or iPhone might fall into the wrong hands, con-
sider setting a combination lock. This chapter shows you how to do all this 
and more: Find out how to change the timer for the backlight on iPod classic 
and iPod nano models, set the brightness of the display on all models, or set 
the contrast of the black-and-white displays of older models. You can even 
wallpaper the display of your iPod touch or iPhone to show a stylin’ back-
ground when it’s locked.
Setting the Date and Time
Your iPod or iPhone may already be set to the correct time, date, and time 
zone, but if not, you can set it yourself. You can also set an iPhone to set the 
time automatically from its cell phone network. The time and date settings 
apply to the time shown in the status bar at the top of the screen, to world 
clocks, and to your calendar.

Using the Clock
You can always know what time it is with your iPod or iPhone — just look at 
the time on the Home menu, or in the main menu title of an iPod classic or 
iPod nano (or fifth-generation iPod) if you turn on the Time in Title option, 
as described in the previous section. But you can also know what time it is 
in other time zones — iPods and iPhones offer multiple clocks to show other 
time zones, and you can set alarms and a sleep timer, and use the built-in 
stopwatch.

 Chapter 18: Changing Your Clock, Lock, and Display Settings
To look at a clock on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or a fifth-generation or most 
older iPods, choose Extras➪Clocks from the main menu. To look at the clock 
on an iPod touch or iPhone, select Clock from the Home menu.
Displaying multiple clocks
You can display clocks with different time zones, which is useful if you tra-
verse time zones or simply want to keep track of time in another time zone. 
(Maybe you like to know the time in Paris if you’re calling from New York.) 
The initial clock and any clocks you add sport a daytime face (white back-
ground and black hands) from 6 a.m. to 5:59 p.m. and a nighttime face (black 
background with white hands) from 6 p.m. to 5:59 a.m.
To create clocks on an iPod touch or iPhone, select Clock from the Home 
menu and touch the World Clock button. To add a clock: 
 
1. Touch the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of the display.
 
 The on-screen keyboard appears with a text entry field.
 
2. Type a city name on the on-screen keyboard and tap Return (or tap 
Cancel next to the text entry field to cancel).
 
 The iPod touch or iPhone looks up the city’s time zone to display the 
clock. (For details on how to use the on-screen keyboard, see Chapter 1.)
To remove a clock, touch the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the dis-
play, and touch the circled minus (–) button next to the clock to delete.
To create more clocks; edit the clocks; or delete additional clocks with the 
iPod classic, iPod nano, or fifth-generation iPod, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Clocks from the main menu, and highlight a clock.
 
 One or more clocks appear (depending on how many you have created), 
showing the present time and location. If you have more than one clock 
and you want to edit one of them, scroll the click wheel to highlight the 
clock you want to edit.
 
2. Press the Select button on the iPod to select the clock.
 
 The Add and Edit options appear, along with a Delete option if you have 
more than one clock.
 
3. Scroll the click wheel to select Add, Edit, or Delete and press the 
Select button.
 
 If you select Add or Edit, a list of geographical regions appears in alpha-
betical order, from Africa to South America. If you select Delete, the 
clock is deleted, and you can skip any more steps.

 The City menu appears with a list of cities in the region in alphabetical 
order.
 
5. Scroll the City list, choose a city, and then press the Select button.
 
 You return to the list of clocks. You now have added a new clock (or 
edited a clock if you selected the Edit option).
Setting alarms 
Time is on your side with your iPod or iPhone. You can set multiple alarms to 
go off on different days and set a variety of tones and sounds for your alarms 
on an iPhone or iPod touch that play through its speaker.
To set an alarm on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Clock from the Home menu and touch the Alarm button along 
the bottom of the display. 
 
2. To add an alarm, touch the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of

11. Repeat Steps 9 and 10 for minutes and AM/PM.
 
 After finishing the AM/PM field, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
12. Choose Repeat from the Alarms submenu, and choose a repeat multiple.
 
 You can choose to set the alarm to go off once, every day, weekdays, 
weekends, every week, every month, or every year. After choosing a 
repeat multiple, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
13. Choose Sounds from the Alarms submenu and choose a tone or a 
playlist.
 
 The Tones and Playlists options appear. Choose Tones to select a beep, 
or set Tones to none (no sound) if you want the iPod to display the 
alarm without making a sound. Choose Playlists to select a playlist. After 
choosing a tone or a playlist, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
14. Choose Label from the Alarms submenu to set a label to identify this 
alarm.
 
 You can set labels for your alarms so that you can identify them easily

After choosing a label, the Alarms submenu of settings appears again.
 
15. Press Menu to return to the Alarms main menu, which now includes 
your new alarm with its label in a list of alarms under the Sleep Timer 
heading.
You can create as many alarms, at different dates and times, as you need. To 
delete an alarm, select the alarm from the list in the Alarms main menu. The 
Alarms submenu appears with a list of options. Choose Delete.
When the alarm goes off, your iPod classic or iPod nano displays an alarm 
message along with the Dismiss and Snooze buttons. Choose Dismiss or 
Snooze by scrolling the click wheel and select it by pressing the Select 
button. Dismiss stops the alarm’s sound, while Snooze stops the sound tem-
porarily and repeats it 10 minutes later.
Using the timer (iPod touch and iPhone)
You can set an hour-and-minute timer for anything — baking cookies, baking 
CDs, or baking in the sun on the beach. The timer built into the Clock application 
on an iPod touch or iPhone will continue running even when playing music or 
videos or running other iPod touch or iPhone applications. You might want to 
use a timer to see if a set of activities — playing songs, playing videos, selecting 
from menus, and running applications — occurs within a specific time. (If you 
need to use seconds as well as minutes and hours, try the stopwatch — see the 
section “Using the stopwatch,” later in this chapter.)

323
 Chapter 18: Changing Your Clock, Lock, and Display Settings
To use the timer, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Clock from the Home menu. 
 
 The Clock display appears.
 
2. Touch the Timer button along the bottom of the Clock display.
 
 The Timer wheel for minutes and hours appears, along with the Start 
button.

6. Touch Start to start the timer.
The timer runs backward. You can touch Cancel to cancel the timer or wait 
until it runs out. When it runs out, the iPod touch or iPhone plays the sound 
(if a sound is set) and presents an OK button. Touch OK to stop the sound.
Setting the sleep timer
As you can with a clock radio sleep timer, you can set your iPod or iPhone to 
play music or videos for a while before going to sleep. 
To set the timer on the iPhone or iPod touch as a sleep timer, first follow the 
instructions in the “Using the timer (iPod touch or iPhone)” section, earlier in 
this chapter. Then touch the When Timer Ends button, and touch Sleep iPod 
at the top of the list to put the iPod touch or iPhone to sleep when the timer 
ends. Touch Set in the upper-right corner of the display to set the Sleep iPod 
option (or Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel). Finally, touch Start to 
start the timer. You can then play music or videos until the timer ends and 
the iPod automatically goes to sleep.
To set the sleep timer on an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose Extras from 
the main menu; then choose Alarms➪Sleep Timer. To set the sleep timer on a 
fifth-generation iPod, select your clock and then choose Sleep Timer from the 
clock’s menu. 
A list of intervals appears, from 0 (Off) up to 120 minutes (2 hours). You can 
select a time amount or the Off setting (at the top of the list) to turn off the 
sleep timer. After the iPod shuts itself off or you turn it off, the preference for 
the Sleep Timer is reset to the default status, Off.

Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
Using the stopwatch
You can use a stopwatch with a lap timer on iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod 
touch, iPhone, and fifth-generation iPod models, which is useful when timing 
exercises, jogging, race laps, how long it takes the bus to travel across town, 
or how long your friend takes to recognize the song you’re playing. Whatever 
you want to measure with accurate time to the tenth of a second, the stop-
watch is ready for you.
 
You can use the iPod or iPhone menus and also play music, audio books, and 
podcasts, while running the stopwatch. When you play video, the stopwatch 
continues to count as usual; when you switch back to the stopwatch display, 
the video automatically pauses.
To use the stopwatch on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Clock from the Home menu and touch the Stopwatch button 
along the bottom of the display. 
 
 A stopwatch appears with Start and Reset buttons and 00:00.00 (min-
utes, seconds, and fractions of seconds) as the stopwatch counter. 
 
2. Touch the Start button to start counting.
 
 The stopwatch starts counting immediately, while the left button 
changes to Stop, and the right button changes to Lap.
 
3. (Optional) Touch the Lap button to mark each lap.
 
 Touch the Lap button to record each lap. Repeat this step for each lap.
 
4. Touch the Stop button to stop counting.
 
 The counter stops counting. The left button changes to Start, and the 
right button changes to Reset. You can resume the count from where 
you left off by touching Start, or you can start the count again from zero 
by touching Reset.
To use the stopwatch on an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Stopwatch from the main menu.
 
 A stopwatch appears with the Play/Pause icon.
 
2. Press the Select button to start counting.
 
 The stopwatch starts counting immediately. 
 
3. (Optional) Press the Select button to mark each lap.
 
 Press the Select button to record the current lap time while counting 
resumes accurately for the next lap. Repeat this step for each lap.

325
 Chapter 18: Changing Your Clock, Lock, and Display Settings
 
4. Press the Play/Pause button to stop counting.
 
 The counter stops counting and the Stopwatch menu appears. The menu 
now includes the Current Log option to show the lap timings for the 
stopwatch session. Also included are previous stopwatch session logs. 
The iPod saves the stopwatch results in a session log for convenience, 
so you don’t have to write them down.
 
5. Select Resume to resume counting, or New Timer to start a new stop-
watch session.
 
 You can resume the stopwatch session from where you left off, or you 
can start a new stopwatch session.
 
6. (Optional) Read your stopwatch logs by choosing Current Log or the 
date of a previous log in the Stopwatch menu.
 
7. (Optional) Delete your stopwatch logs by choosing Clear Logs in the 
Stopwatch menu.
Choosing Display Settings
Your future might be so bright that you gotta wear shades, but your iPod or 
iPhone display might not be bright enough. From the Settings menu, you can 
change the timer for the backlight on iPod classic and iPod nano models, and 
set the brightness of the display on all models, as well as set the contrast of 
the black-and-white displays of older models. Choose the Settings menu from 
the main menu of an iPod classic, nano, or older model, or from the Home 
menu of an iPod touch or iPhone.
Backlight timer
The iPod classic, iPod nano, and older iPods use a display backlight that 
turns on when you press a button or use the scroll wheel, and then turns off 
after a short amount of time. On third-generation iPods, the backlight also 
lights up the iPod buttons.
You can set the backlight on iPod classic and iPod nano models to remain on 
for a certain interval of time. Choose Settings➪Backlight from the main menu. 
A menu appears, giving you the options of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 
15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and Always On. Select one by scrolling 
to highlight the selection and then press the Select button.
 
Using the backlight drains an iPod battery; the longer you set the interval, the 
more frequently you need to recharge the battery.

326
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
To set the backlight to always be on, choose Always On. If you want the back-
light to always be off, choose Always Off. If you set it to always be off, the 
backlight doesn’t turn on automatically when you press any button or use 
the scroll wheel.
 
Don’t be alarmed if your backlight turns itself on at midnight for a brief flash. 
The iPod is just setting its internal clock. If you find this annoying, turn off the 
Backlight Timer.
Brightness and contrast
To adjust the brightness for an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪
Brightness from the Home menu. The Brightness screen appears with a slider 
that shows the brightness setting, which ranges from low (a dim sun icon) to 
high (a bright sun icon). Slide the brightness slider’s knob with your finger 
to the right to increase the brightness (toward the bright sun) and to the 
left to decrease the brightness (toward the dim sun).
To adjust the brightness for an iPod classic or nano, choose 
Settings➪Brightness from the main menu. The Brightness screen appears 
with a slider that shows the brightness setting, which ranges from low (a 
quarter-moon icon) to high (a bright sun icon). Scroll clockwise to increase 
the brightness (toward the bright sun) and counterclockwise to decrease the 
brightness (toward the moon). 
You can also set the contrast of black-and-white iPod displays to make the 
black characters appear sharper against the display background. (This fea-
ture isn’t provided on color-display iPod models.)
To adjust the contrast, choose Settings➪Contrast from the main menu. The 
Contrast screen appears with a slider that shows the contrast setting, which 
ranges from low contrast (a black-and-white dot) to high contrast (a full black 
dot). Scroll clockwise to increase the contrast (toward the black dot) and 
counterclockwise to decrease the contrast (toward the black-and-white dot).
 
You might need to adjust the contrast of a black-and-white iPod if a sharp 
temperature difference freezes or bakes your iPod. If you leave your iPod in 
your car overnight in the cold or in direct sunlight, the contrast can change so 
much that you can’t see your iPod display. Slowly, allow the iPod to warm up 
(don’t use the oven or microwave) or cool down. Then adjust the contrast.
If you accidentally set the contrast too dark or too light, you can reset it to 
the halfway point between too dark and too light by pressing and holding the 
Menu button for at least four seconds.

Wallpaper for your iPod touch or iPhone
Why not wallpaper the back of your display? You can make your iPod touch 
or iPhone display a stylish background when it is locked. You can also put up 
photos or other images from your photo library as your wallpaper.
It’s not like you’ll see it often — the iPod touch or iPhone displays the wallpa-
per image when you first press the Sleep/Wake button. Once you swipe with 
your finger to unlock your iPod touch or iPhone, the wallpaper is replaced by 
the Home menu or whatever application you were last running.
To set the wallpaper on an iPod touch, choose Settings➪General➪Wallpaper 
from the Home menu. On an iPhone, choose Settings➪Wallpaper. 
You can then choose from among stylish built-in wallpaper images by touch-
ing Wallpaper. You can also choose from the entire photo library on your 
iPod touch or iPhone by choosing Photo Library, or choose from a specific 
photo album in your library. On an iPhone, you can also choose the latest roll 
from the iPhone’s built-in camera by choosing Camera Roll. 
Touch a thumbnail to select the image for your wallpaper, or touch 
Wallpaper in the upper-left corner to return to the Wallpaper menu. After 
touching an image, your iPod touch or iPhone displays the Move and Scale 
screen, which lets you optionally pan the image by dragging your finger, 
and optionally zoom in or out of the image by pinching and unpinching your 
fingers. Touch the Set Wallpaper button to set the image as your wallpaper 
or touch Cancel to cancel.
Setting the Combination Lock
You can set a four-digit combination for your iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod 
touch, iPhone, or fifth-generation iPod that locks the navigation controls, pre-
venting anyone else from selecting content. Note: The lock works only when 
your iPod or iPhone is not attached to a computer.
If you’re playing music when you lock your iPod or iPhone, the music con-
tinues playing — and you can even use the Play/Pause button to pause and 
resume playback — but you can’t navigate the iPod or iPhone until you pro-
vide the combination. You also can’t change the volume.
 
To conserve power, you can force your iPod to go to sleep by pressing the Play/
Pause button, but it won’t unlock. When it awakes, it remembers everything — 
including its combination.

328
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
 
Don’t bother to call Apple to see whether the company can unlock your iPod 
or iPhone for you. If you can’t attach it to the proper computer or enter the 
correct combination, your only recourse is to restore the iPod or iPhone to its 
factory conditions.
To set a combination lock for your iPhone or iPod touch, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the Home menu.

 You can turn the passcode off, change it, or set the Require Passcode 
option to Immediately, After 1 minute, or after several minutes.
 
5. When done, touch General to return to the General menu.
To set a combination lock for your iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock.
 
 The Screen Lock icon appears with your combination lock set to zeros.
 
2. Select the first number of the combination by scrolling the click wheel.
 
 While you scroll with your iPod, the first digit of the combination 
changes. You can also press the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward 
button to scroll through numbers.
 
3. Press the Select button to pick a number.
 
 This sets your choice for the first number and moves on to the next 
number of the combination.
 
4. Scroll to select each number of the combination and then press the 
Select button to set the number.
 
 Repeat this step for each number of the combination. When you pick 
the last number, the message Confirm Combination appears. Repeat 
Steps 2 and 3 for each number of the combination to confirm it. When 
you finish confirming the combination, the Lock and Reset options 
appear.

329
 Chapter 18: Changing Your Clock, Lock, and Display Settings
 
5. Choose Lock or Reset.
 
 Select Lock to lock the iPod, or Reset to reset the combination to zeros 
and return to Step 2. To unlock the iPod after locking it, press any 
button and then repeat Steps 2 and 3 to enter each number of the 
combination. 
 
Don’t forget this combination! Use a four-digit number that is easy to commit 
to memory.
To unlock a locked iPod or iPhone, you must do one of the following:
 
 Enter the same combination. After correctly entering the combination, 
the iPod unlocks and returns to the last viewed screen.
 
 Attach the iPod or iPhone to the computer you used to synchronize it 
with iTunes. When you disconnect it after synchronizing with iTunes, 
the iPod or iPhone is no longer locked.
 
 Restore your iPod or iPhone to its original factory settings. As I 
describe in Chapter 20, this erases everything in the process. This is, of 
course, a measure of last resort.
To set the combination lock on fifth-generation iPods and some older models, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock.
 
 The Screen Lock menu appears.
 
2. From the Screen Lock menu that appears, choose Set Combination.
 
 The Enter New Code display appears.
 
3. Select the first number of the combination by scrolling the click 
wheel.
 
 While you scroll with your iPod, the first digit of the combination 
changes in the Enter New Code display. You can also press the Previous/
Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward button to scroll through numbers.
 
4. Press the Select button to confirm.
 
 This confirms your choice for the first number and moves on to the next 
number of the combination.
 
5. Scroll to select each number of the combination and then press the 
Select button to confirm.
 
 Repeat this step for each number of the combination. When you confirm 
the last digit, the iPod displays the Screen Lock menu.

Synchronizing Personal Info 
with Your iPod or iPhone
In This Chapter
 Synchronizing iPod and iPhone calendars and contacts automatically
 Synchronizing e-mail accounts with an iPod touch or iPhone
 Synchronizing Web browser bookmarks with an iPod touch or iPhone
I
 chose an iPod classic for music and videos, but I also find it useful while 
 traveling for viewing the personal information — contacts, appointments, 
and events — that I manage on my computer. The same is true for the iPod 
nano I carry into the gym. iPod classic, nano, and older models offer one-way 
synchronization from computer to iPod.
An iPod touch or iPhone lets me go one step further and send and receive 
e-mail (as I describe in Chapter 16) and use my Safari browser bookmarks (as 
I show in Chapter 15). I can also add personal info directly to my iPod touch 
or iPhone, and synchronize that information back with my computer, which 
is two-way synchronization. 
You manage your contacts, calendars, e-mail, and Web bookmarks on your 
computer. If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: You can use the free iCal 
and Address Book applications to manage your calendars and contacts, 
the free Mail program to manage e-mail, and the free Safari Web browser to 
manage your bookmarks. All these applications are provided with Mac OS X. 
If you’re a Windows user, you can choose between Microsoft Outlook (and 
its accompanying Address Book) and Outlook Express to manage calendars, 
contacts, and e-mail, and you can use Microsoft Internet Explorer to manage 
bookmarks.
You use iTunes to synchronize your iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or 
iPhone with calendars and contacts on your computer. If you also signed up 
for Apple’s MobileMe service (formerly the .Mac service, now www.me.com), 
you can automatically keep your iPod touch or iPhone synchronized along 

332
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
with several computers, all at once, with the latest e-mail, bookmarks, cal-
endar entries, and contacts. MobileMe stores all your e-mail, contacts, and 
calendars on a Web server. You can then keep your iPod touch or iPhone 
synchronized to your computer wirelessly, from anywhere, without having 
to connect the device to your computer. Your iPod touch or iPhone can 
receive pushed data over a Wi-Fi connection as long as the device is awake 
(the screen is on, or it is connected to your computer or to a power adapter). 
Changes you make to contacts and calendars at me.com are updated on your 
device in seconds, and vice versa. 
 
You probably already know how to manage your calendar activities and your 
contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably knee-deep in electronic 
contacts, and your electronic calendars look like they were drawn up in the West 
Wing. If not, visit the tips section of the author’s Web site (www.tonybove.com) 
for tips on using MobileMe, on adding and editing contacts and calendar infor-
mation on your Mac (with Address Book and iCal) or Windows computer (with 
Outlook), and on saving and exporting industry-standard calendar and contact 
files that you can then add to your iPod. I also explain how to use third-party 
utilities to manage personal information on your iPod.
Synchronizing Contacts and Calendars
To synchronize your iPod or iPhone with contacts and calendars using 
iTunes, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod classic (or older model), iPod nano, iPod touch, or 
iPhone to your computer.
 
 iTunes launches automatically (if it isn’t running already and you 
haven’t changed the sync preferences for the device as described in 
Chapter 11).
 
2. Select the iPod or iPhone name in the Devices section of the iTunes 
Source pane.
 
 If iTunes launched automatically, the iPod or iPhone should already be 
selected; if it isn’t, select it. The iPod or iPhone Summary page appears 
to the right of the Source pane.
 
3. Click the Contacts tab for an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older 
model), or click the Info tab for an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
 The Contacts and Calendars synchronization options page appears for 
an iPod classic, nano, or older model, as shown in Figure 19-1. The Info 
page appears for an iPod touch or iPhone, as shown in Figure 19-2, offer-
ing not only the MobileMe setup button and Contacts and Calendars 
sections, but also, if you scroll the page, Mail Accounts, Web Browser

4. Select the option to synchronize contacts.
 
 On a Mac: Select the Sync Address Book Contacts check box (refer to 
Figure 19-1 for an iPod classic, nano, or older model; or see Figure 19-2 
for an iPod touch or iPhone). For color-display iPods, you can also select 
the option to Include Contacts’ Photos (these are copied automatically 
with the iPod touch or iPhone). 
 
 The iPod touch or iPhone Info page also lets you sync with Yahoo! 
Address Book contacts. If you sync with Yahoo! Address Book, you need 
to click Configure once to enter your login information. 
 
 On a Windows PC: Select the Sync Contents From option and choose 
Windows Address Book or Microsoft Outlook from the drop-down menu.
 
5. Select the All Contacts option. (Alternatively, select the Selected 
Groups option and choose which groups to synchronize.)
 
 You can synchronize all contacts (as in Figure 19-2) or just selected 
groups of contacts (such as the iPod_contacts group, as shown in 
Figure 19-1). To choose groups, select the check box next to each 
group in the list; scroll the list to see more groups.
 
 iTunes automatically keeps your contacts synchronized if you make 
changes on your computer or on your iPod touch or iPhone.
 
6. To synchronize calendars, scroll the page and select the Sync iCal 
Calendars option (Mac) or the Sync Calendars from Microsoft Outlook 
option (Windows PC).
 
7. Select the All Calendars option. (Alternatively, if you’re using iCal 
with Mac OS X, select the Selected Calendars option and choose the 
calendars to synchronize.)
 
 You can synchronize all calendars, but not selected calendars, with 
Microsoft Outlook in Windows. (The selected option is grayed out.) With 
iCal on Mac OS X, you can synchronize all calendars or just those you 
select. To choose specific calendars, select the check box next to each 
calendar in the list. 
 
 The iPod touch and iPhone also provide the Do Not Sync Events Older 
Than xx Days option, in which you can set the xx number of days.
 
8. Select the calendar to use for new events entered into your iPod touch 
or iPhone (Mac OS X only).
 
 If you’re using Mac OS X and iCal, you should set the calendar to use for 
new events you create on your iPod touch or iPhone. Choose a calendar 
name in the Put New Events Into the Calendar option. When you create 
a new event on your iPod touch or iPhone (as I describe in Chapter 16) 
and sync it back to your computer, the new event will appear in this 

335
 Chapter 19: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone
calendar. This affects only new events — events you modify on your 
iPod touch or iPhone retain their calendar information from before. 
 
 Because you can’t select individual calendars with Outlook in Windows, 
this option is grayed out — all events you create on iPod touch or 
iPhone synchronize with the Outlook main calendar.
 
9. Click Apply to apply the changes. (Alternatively, click Cancel to 
cancel the changes.)
 
 iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod or iPhone. Wait until it finishes 
synchronization before ejecting and disconnecting your iPod or iPhone. 
The iTunes status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync is 
Complete.
 
 10. After iTunes finishes synchronizing, eject the iPod or iPhone by click-
ing the Eject button next to its name in the Source pane, and then 
disconnect your iPod or iPhone.
 
 Remember to wait for the OK to disconnect message or the iPod or 
iPhone main menu before disconnecting your iPod or iPhone.
After setting the synchronization options, every time you connect your 
iPod or iPhone, iTunes automatically synchronizes your device with your 
calendars and contacts unless you change these options or sync options 
described in Chapter 11.
 
If you select a calendar or a group of contacts to be synchronized and later 
want to remove that particular calendar or group of contacts, deselect the cal-
endar (see the preceding Step 7) or the group (see the preceding Step 5) and 
then click Apply to resynchronize. iTunes synchronizes only the group of con-
tacts and calendars selected, removing from an iPod or iPhone any that aren’t 
selected.
If you sign up for MobileMe, you can use the service to synchronize your 
contacts, calendars, and bookmarks by pushing them to your computer and 
to your iPod touch or iPhone, so that the information arrives immediately 
on your iPod touch or iPhone without having to connect the device to your 
computer. For example, if you add a contact to the address book on your 
computer, the new contact is automatically pushed to iPod touch or iPhone 
as well as to any other computer or device configured with the service.
 
To learn more about using MobileMe to synchronize contacts and calendars, 
visit the tips section of the author’s Web site (www.tonybove.com).
 
After you synchronize and otherwise finish using your iPod or iPhone with 
your computer, be sure to eject the device. If you forget this, the device might 
not properly close its flash drive or hard drive and become unresponsive, and 
you might need to reset it.

Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
Managing E-Mail Accounts on 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
Your iPod touch or iPhone can send and receive e-mail (as I describe in 
Chapter 16). You use iTunes to synchronize your iPod touch or iPhone with 
e-mail accounts on your computer. 
iTunes can synchronize accounts in Mail and Microsoft Entourage on a Mac 
running OS X, or in Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007 and Outlook Express on 
a PC running Windows. Your iPod touch or iPhone can use the Exchange 
ActiveSync protocol to sync e-mail, calendars, and contacts with Microsoft 
Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2 or Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1. 
For many e-mail accounts, the settings automatically appear. 
MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail e-mail accounts push e-mail 
messages to your computer and your iPod touch or iPhone so that they 
arrive immediately, automatically. Other types of accounts fetch e-mail from 
the server — you must first select the account in Mail before your iPhone or 
iPod touch retrieves the e-mail. 
 
To learn how you can use MobileMe to keep your iPod touch or iPhone syn-
chronized with personal information including e-mail messages, visit the tips 
section of the author’s Web site (www.tonybove.com).
If you chose automatic syncing during the iPod touch or iPhone setup (as 
I describe in Chapter 2), your e-mail accounts should already be set up on 
your iPod touch or iPhone. If not, you can set iTunes to sync your e-mail 
accounts automatically, or you can manually set up your e-mail accounts 
directly on your iPod touch or iPhone. You can also make changes to an 
e-mail account’s settings directly on your iPod touch or iPhone — changes 
you make are not copied to your computer, so you can use different settings 
on your iPod touch or iPhone without affecting your computer’s e-mail.
 
Need help setting up e-mail accounts on your iPod touch? Try Apple’s online 
Mail Setup Assistant (www.apple.com/support/ipodtouch/mailhelper), 
which provides step-by-step instructions based on your specific e-mail address.
Synchronizing e-mail accounts 
automatically 
Synchronizing an e-mail account to your iPod touch or iPhone copies only 
the e-mail account setup information; the messages are retrieved by the 

337
 Chapter 19: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone
iPod touch or iPhone over the Internet. Whether the messages in your inbox 
appear on your iPhone or iPod touch and on your computer depends on the 
type of e-mail account you have and how you’ve configured it.
To synchronize your iPod touch or iPhone with your e-mail accounts, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod touch or iPhone to your computer.
 
 iTunes launches automatically (if it isn’t running already).
 
2. Select the iPod touch or iPhone name in the Devices section of the 
iTunes Source pane.
 
 If iTunes launched automatically, the iPod touch or iPhone should 
already be selected; if it isn’t, select it. The iPod touch or iPhone sum-
mary page appears to the right of the Source pane.
 
3. Click the Info tab.
 
 The Info page appears for an iPod touch or iPhone. Scroll the page to 
see Mail Accounts, as shown in Figure 19-3.
 
4. Select the Sync Selected Mail Accounts option (Mac), or choose 
Outlook or Outlook Express from the pop-up menu for the Sync 
Selected Mail Accounts From option (Windows PC).
 
Figure 19-3: 
Set an iPod 
touch (or 
iPhone) to

5. Choose e-mail accounts to sync.
 
 To choose accounts, select the check box next to each account in the 
list; scroll the list to see more e-mail accounts. 
 
6. Click Sync to finish.
 
 You may have to click Apply first if you’ve made other changes. 
(Alternatively, click Cancel to cancel the changes.)
 
 
 iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod or iPhone. Wait until it finishes 
synchronization before ejecting and disconnecting your iPod or iPhone. 
The iTunes status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync is 
Complete.
iTunes also offers Advanced options at the bottom of the Info page (refer 
to Figure 19-3) for synchronizing your iPod touch or iPhone from scratch to 
replace all contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks. You can choose 
which ones to replace by selecting the check box next to each option. iTunes 
replaces the information once, during the next sync operation. After that 
operation, these Advanced options are automatically turned off.
Setting up and deleting e-mail 
accounts manually
You can also enter an e-mail account’s settings directly into your iPod touch 
or iPhone using the on-screen keyboard, without affecting any settings you 
may already have on your computer for that account. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home menu.
 
 The Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears with the Accounts 
section at the top.
 
2. Touch Add Account at the end of the list of accounts in the Accounts 
section.
 
3. Choose your e-mail account type from the list of account types: 
Microsoft Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, AOL, or Other. 
 
4. Enter your account information: name, e-mail address, password, and 
optional description.
 
 Enter information by tapping next to a field’s name (such as Name or 
Address) to display the on-screen keyboard. Use the keyboard to enter 
the information, and tap Return to move on to the next field. 

339
 Chapter 19: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone
 
5. Touch Save in the upper-right corner to save the account information, 
or Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel.
 
 For Microsoft Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or AOL: Your iPod 
touch or iPhone verifies the account, and then lists the account in the 
Accounts section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen. 
 
 For Other: Your iPod touch or iPhone searches for the account on the 
Internet and displays the New Account settings screen. Tap IMAP (Internet 
Message Access Protocol) or POP (Post Office Protocol) depending on 
the type of e-mail account — ask your e-mail service provider if you don’t 
know. Then enter or edit the existing account information (also get this 
information from your service provider if you don’t know):
 
• Your e-mail address 
 
• The host name for your incoming mail server (for example, mail.
example.com) along with your username and password for 
incoming mail
 
• The host name for your outgoing mail server (for example, smtp.
example.com) along with your username and password for outgo-
ing mail
 
 If you touch Cancel, you return to the list of account types (Step 3). 
Touch Mail in the upper-left corner to return to the Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars settings screen.
 
 If the account can’t be verified, the message Cannot Get Mail appears, 
indicating that the username or password is incorrect. Tap OK, and try 
Steps 4 and 5 again (or touch Cancel to cancel).
To delete an e-mail account from your iPod touch or iPhone, choose 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home menu; tap an account 
in the Accounts section; and then scroll down and tap Delete Account. 
Deleting an e-mail account from iPod touch or iPhone doesn’t delete it from 
your computer.
Changing e-mail account 
settings manually
To turn off e-mail accounts or change account settings, choose Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars from from your iPod touch or iPhone Home menu, and 
then touch an account in the Accounts section to see that account’s settings 
screen. 

340
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
 
Changes you make to accounts are not transferred back to your computer 
when you synchronize, so it’s safe to make changes without affecting e-mail 
account settings on your computer.
The settings are different depending on the type of e-mail account (POP or 
IMAP) you’re using. To adjust e-mail server settings, touch Host Name, User 
Name, or Password under Incoming Mail Server or Outgoing Mail Server. 
Ask your network administrator or Internet service provider for the correct 
settings.
You can turn the account off (without deleting it) by choosing an account 
and touching the On button next to Account at the top of the screen (touch 
it again to turn the account back on). After turning an account off, Mail stops 
checking e-mail or sending e-mail with that account and doesn’t display it in 
the list of accounts until you turn it back on.
Mail offers advanced settings for POP and IMAP accounts as well as for 
MobileMe, AOL, and other popular accounts. For POP accounts, touch the 
account in the Accounts section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings 
screen, and then touch Advanced at the bottom of the account’s settings 
screen to change the following advanced settings:
 
 Use security (SSL) and password settings: Ask your network administra-
tor or Internet service provider about whether your e-mail account uses 
SSL; if it does, turn on SSL by touching the Off button so that it changes 
to On. 
 
 Authentication: Ask your network administrator or Internet service 
provider about whether your e-mail account requires authentication 
and which type of authentication; if it does, touch Authentication and 
choose the method required — MD5 Challenge-Response, NTLM, HTTP 
MD5 Digest, or Password. (It is beyond the scope of this book to explain 
all these options — ask your network administrator or Internet service 
provider.)
 
 Delete from server: Decide when deleted messages should be removed 
permanently from your iPod touch or iPhone. Your options are Never, 
Seven Days, or When Removed from Inbox.
 
 Server Port: Set your server port, which must be provided by your net-
work administrator or Internet service provider.
For IMAP, MobileMe, AOL, and other popular accounts, touch the account 
in the Accounts section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings, and then 
touch Account Info to change the e-mail account’s Name, Address, Password, 
Description, and Outgoing Mail Server. Touch Advanced in the Account Info 
screen to change the following advanced settings: 

341
 Chapter 19: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone
 
 Mailbox Behaviors: In the Mailbox Behaviors section of the Advanced 
settings screen, choose
 
• Drafts Mailbox to set whether drafts are stored on your iPod touch 
or iPhone, or remotely on your e-mail server. If you store drafts on 
your iPod touch or iPhone, you can view and edit them even with-
out connecting to the Internet.
 
• Sent Mailbox to set whether sent messages are stored on your iPod 
touch or iPhone, or remotely on your e-mail server.
 
• Deleted Mailbox to set whether deleted messages are immediately 
trashed or saved remotely on your e-mail server.
 
 Deleted Messages: Decide when deleted messages should be removed 
permanently from your iPod touch or iPhone. Touch Remove and then 
choose a time. Your options are Never or After One Day, After One 
Week, or After One Month.
 
 Incoming Settings: You can turn SSL on or off and set the Authentication 
method (as described previously in this section). You can also set an 
IMAP Path Prefix and change your server port. It is beyond the scope of 
this book to explain these settings, so ask your network administrator or 
Internet service provider to help you.
Synchronizing Web Bookmarks 
with Your iPod touch or iPhone
Don’t go on a Web hunt without your bookmarks! You can use iTunes to syn-
chronize your bookmarks — from Safari on a Mac, or from Safari or Microsoft 
Internet Explorer on a Windows PC — with the Safari Web browser in your 
iPod touch or iPhone. Follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod touch or iPhone to your computer.
 
 iTunes launches automatically (if it isn’t running already or you haven’t 
chaneged its sync preferences as described in Chapter 11).
 
2. Select the iPod touch or iPhone name in the Devices section of the 
iTunes Source pane.
 
 If iTunes launched automatically, the iPod touch or iPhone should 
already be selected; if it isn’t, select it. The iPod touch or iPhone sum-
mary page appears to the right of the Source pane.
 
3. Click the Info tab.
 
 The Info page appears for an iPod touch or iPhone. Scroll the page to 
see Web Browser options (refer to Figure 19-3).

342
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
 
4. Select the option to Sync Bookmarks.
 
 On a Mac running OS X, the option is Sync Safari Bookmarks; on a 
Windows PC, iTunes selects Internet Explorer or Safari for this option, 
depending on which one is your default browser.
 
5. Click Sync to finish.
 
 You may have to click Apply first if you’ve made other changes. 
(Alternatively, click Cancel to cancel the changes.)
 
 
 iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod or iPhone. Wait until it finishes 
synchronization before ejecting and disconnecting your iPod or iPhone. 
The iTunes status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync Is 
Complete.

T
his chapter describes some of the problems that you might encounter 
with your iPod (iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or older-model iPod) 
or iPhone, and how to fix them. If your iPod or iPhone fails to turn on or your 
computer fails to recognize it, you can most likely find a solution here or 
directions on how to find more information.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software on your iPod 
or iPhone, and restoring your iPod or iPhone to its factory default condition. 
(Firmware is software encoded in hardware.) Restoring a device is a drastic 
measure that erases any music or information on the device, but it usually 
solves the problem if nothing else does.
Taking Your First Troubleshooting Steps
Problems can arise with electronics and software that can prevent an iPod or 
iPhone from turning on at all or from turning on properly with all its content 
and playlists. You can also have problems in the connection between your 
iPod or iPhone and your computer.
Checking the Hold switch
If your iPod classic, nano, or older iPod model refuses to turn on, check the 
position of the Hold switch — on the top of an iPod classic or older model, 
or on the bottom next to the dock connection on the iPod nano. The Hold 

344
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
switch locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t accidentally activate them. 
Slide the Hold switch away from the headphone connection, hiding the 
orange layer, to unlock the buttons. (If you see the orange layer underneath 
one end of the Hold switch, the switch is still in the locked position.) 
The “hold” switch for an iPod shuffle is actually the on-off switch, located on 
top next to the word OFF. Slide this switch away from OFF to turn on your 
iPod shuffle.
Rather than a hold button, iPod touch and iPhone models display the message 
Slide to unlock — slide your finger across this message to unlock your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
Checking the power
Got power? The battery might not be charged enough. If the battery is too 
low for normal operation, the iPod or iPhone refuses to turn on. Instead, a 
low battery screen appears for a short while, and then if no power arrives to 
save the iPod or iPhone, the icon disappears altogether. At that point, your 
only choice is to connect the iPod or iPhone to an AC power source, wait 
for a moment, and then turn the power on by pushing any button on an iPod 
classic, nano, shuffle, or older iPod model, or by pushing the Home button on 
the iPod touch or iPhone. 
If your source of AC power is your computer, make sure that the computer 
is on and not set to go to sleep. The Battery icon in the upper right of the 
display indicates whether the iPod or iPhone battery is full or recharging. 
For more information about maintaining a healthy battery, see Chapter 1.
If your current-model iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its 
battery by first connecting it to its dock and then connecting the dock to the 
AC power adapter or the USB connection on your computer. First-generation 
iPod shuffle models connect directly to the USB connection on your computer.
Resetting an iPod classic, 
iPod nano, or older iPod
This operation resets the operating system of an iPod and restarts the system 
(similar to resetting the operating system of a computer). It does not restore 
the iPod to its original factory conditions, nor does it wipe anything out — 
your content and iPod settings remain intact. Sometimes when your iPod gets 
confused or refuses to turn on, you can fix it by resetting its operating system.

345
 Chapter 20: Updating and Troubleshooting
For iPod classic and nano models, fifth-generation video iPods, fourth-
generation iPods, iPod mini, and color-display iPods, follow these steps:
 
1. (Optional) Connect the iPod to a power outlet by using the AC power 
adapter.
 
 You can reset your iPod without connecting it to power if it has enough 
juice in its battery. However, if you have access to power, it makes sense 
to use it because the reset operation uses power.
 
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
 
 Push the Hold switch to hold (lock) and then set it back to unlock.
 
3. Press the Menu and Select buttons simultaneously and hold for at 
least six seconds or until the Apple logo appears; then release the but-
tons when you see the Apple logo.
 
 The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting 
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
 
Release the Menu and Select buttons as soon as you see the Apple logo. If 
you continue to press the buttons after the logo appears, the iPod displays 
the low battery icon, and you must connect it to a power source before using 
it again.
For first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models, follow these steps:
 
1. (Optional) Connect the iPod to a power outlet by using the AC power 
adapter.
 
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
 
 Push the Hold switch to hold (lock) and then set it back to unlock.
 
3. Press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously and hold for 
at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears; then release the 
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
 
 The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting 
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music 
and data files.

Resetting an iPod shuffle
To reset an iPod shuffle, first disconnect it from your computer (if you haven’t 
already done so) and then switch the On/Off switch to the Off position. Wait 
five seconds and then switch the On/Off switch back to the On position.
To reset the first-generation iPod shuffle, first disconnect it from your com-
puter (if you haven’t already done so) and then switch the slider on the back 
to the Off position. The green stripe under the switch should not be visible. 
Wait five seconds and then switch the slider back to the Shuffle Songs or Play 
in Order position.
Resetting an iPod touch or iPhone
You probably won’t be too surprised to discover that, on the off chance your 
iPod touch or iPhone gets confused or refuses to turn on, you can fix it by 
resetting it and restarting the system — just like all the other iPods out there. 
This does not restore the iPod touch or iPhone to its original factory condi-
tions, nor does it erase anything — your content and settings remain intact.
What’s different about the iPod touch and iPhone is the fact that they actu-
ally run applications. If your iPod touch or iPhone freezes while running an 
application (such as Mail or Safari), press and hold the Home button below 
the screen for at least six seconds, until the application quits. If the iPod 
touch or iPhone still doesn’t respond, turn it off by pressing the Sleep/Wake 
(On/Off) button on the top, and then press the same button again to turn it 
back on.
If that doesn’t work, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the top for a 
few seconds until a red slider appears on the screen that says “slide to power 
off,” and then slide the slider with your finger. The iPod touch or iPhone 
powers down. Then press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple 
logo appears. The iPod touch or iPhone starts up again.
Finally, if none of these options works, reset the iPod touch or iPhone by 
pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the 
same time for at least ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music 
and data files.

 Chapter 20: Updating and Troubleshooting
Draining the battery
Certain types of battery-powered devices sometimes run into problems if the 
battery hasn’t drained in a while. In rare cases, an iPod or iPhone might go 
dark. Try resetting the iPod or iPhone first. If the device still doesn’t work, 
disconnect it from any power source and leave it disconnected for approxi-
mately 24 hours. After this period, connect it to power and reset.
If you left the iPod or iPhone in the cold, let it warm up to room temperature 
before waking it from sleep. Otherwise, the battery may not function properly 
and a low-battery icon might appear (if the device wakes at all). If the iPod 
or iPhone doesn’t wake from sleep after warming up, reset the device as I 
describe in the preceding section. Try to keep your iPod or iPhone at room 
temperature — generally near 68° Fahrenheit (F)/20° Celsius (C). However, 
you can use the iPod or iPhone anywhere between 50–95° F (10–35° C).
Updating Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
You should always keep your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV updated with 
new versions of the software that controls the device. iTunes automatically 
checks for updates of this software and lets you update your devices without 
affecting the music or data stored on them. 
 
If you use MusicMatch Jukebox rather than iTunes on your Windows PC, skip 
this section and see the tips section of the author’s Web site (www.toney
bove.com).
Make sure that you use the newest version of iTunes. To check for the avail-
ability of an updated version for Windows, choose Help➪Check for iTunes 
Updates.
If you use a Mac and you enabled the Software Update option in your System 
Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your Apple soft-
ware for the Mac, including iTunes, iCal, and Address Book. All you need to 
do is select which updates to download and then click the Install button to 
download them. iTunes includes updates for all generations of iPods and can 
detect which iPod model you have.
 
When you turn on your iPod or iPhone, built-in startup diagnostic software 
checks the device’s software for problems and attempts to repair the software 
if necessary. If the iPod or iPhone finds an issue while it’s on, it automatically 
uses internal diagnostics to repair any damage. You might see a disk scan icon 
on your iPod or iPhone screen after turning it on, indicating that a problem was 
fixed. If you see this indicator, update your iPod or iPhone software with iTunes.

348
Part IV: The Traveling iPod and iPhone 
Checking the software version
To determine which version of iPod software is installed on your iPod clas-
sic, nano, or older iPod, choose Settings➪About from the iPod main menu. 
(With first- and second-generation iPods, choose Settings➪Info.) Similarly, on 
an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪General➪About. Next to the word 
Version is information that describes the software version installed.
You can also determine the software version on your iPod or iPhone by using 
iTunes. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer and select the iPod 
or iPhone in the iTunes Source pane (in the Devices section). The device’s 
summary page appears to the right of the Source pane, and the software 
version appears next to the Software Version heading at the top of the 
page.
Updating with newer software
iTunes tells you whether your iPod or iPhone has the newest software 
installed. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer and select it in the 
iTunes Source pane (in the Devices section). The iPod or iPhone summary 
page appears to the right of the Source pane, and the Version section of the 
page tells you whether your iPod or iPhone software is up to date and when 
iTunes will check for new software. (See Figure 20-1.) You can check for new 
software at any time by clicking the Check for Update button on the Summary 
page.
 
Some iPod models need to be disconnected from the computer temporarily 
and connected to a power source to finish the process of updating the soft-
ware. Follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod and connect it to an AC 
power adapter, if required.
Updating an Apple TV
Apple TV can access the Internet through your wireless or Ethernet network, 
so the device can automatically check whether new software is available. 
Apple TV checks the Apple update server on a weekly schedule. When Apple 
TV detects an update, it downloads the update automatically and displays on 
your TV the message “An update is available for your Apple TV, do you want 
to install it now?” Apple TV then displays on your TV two choices: Update 
Now, or in case you’re a procrastinator, Update Later. Choose either option 
using your Apple Remote.
You don’t have to wait for Apple TV to check for an update. You can update 
Apple TV at any time by choosing Settings➪General➪Update Software from

Restoring Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
You can restore any iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to its original “factory” con-
dition. This operation erases the storage (flash memory in an iPod touch, 
iPhone, iPod nano, or iPod shuffle; or hard drive in an iPod classic or Apple 
TV) and returns the device to its factory settings. If you intend to change the 
computer you’re using for synchronizing your iPod or iPhone, you have to 
restore the device, especially if you’re switching from a Mac to a PC as your 
synchronizing computer.
To replace content that was erased by the restore operation, synchronize 
your iPod or iPhone from your computer’s iTunes library, as I describe in 
Chapter 11.
 
Be sure that you back up any important data that you keep stored on an iPod 
classic, nano, shuffle, or older iPod model enabled as a hard drive. To learn how 
to enable these devices as hard drives, visit this book’s companion Web site.

Restoring previous iPod touch, iPhone, 
or Apple TV settings
iTunes provides protection and backs up your iPod touch, iPhone, or Apple 
TV settings so that you can restore them. iTunes automatically copies from 
your iPod touch, iPhone, and Apple TV any notes, contact favorites, sound 
settings, and other preferences when you sync the device to your computer. 
You can then restore this information if you get a new iPod touch, iPhone, or 
Apple TV, or if you need to restore the device to factory conditions, and want 
to use these preferences with the new or restored device. 
 
You can also restore settings from your computer after resetting the set-
tings for an iPod touch or iPhone — not resetting the operating system, as 
described in “Resetting an iPod touch or iPhone” in this chapter, but resetting 
your custom settings such as Wi-Fi networks, your Home menu layout, your 
on-screen keyboard dictionary entries, and your Auto-Lock and Brightness set-
tings. You may want to reset the settings on an iPod touch or iPhone if you’re 
having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network. To reset the settings in your 
iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪General➪Reset. You can then choose 
Reset All Settings, Erase All Content and Settings, Reset Keyboard Dictionary, 
Reset Network Settings, or Reset Home Screen Layout. When you reset net-
work settings, your list of previously used networks is removed, and Wi-Fi is 
turned off, disconnecting you from the network. Your Wi-Fi setting and Ask to 
Join Networks option remains on, so your iPod touch or iPhone may connect 
to Wi-Fi again (or try to).
 
To learn more about customizing your iPod touch or iPhone Home menu and 
resetting your custom settings, visit this book’s companion Web site.
 
You can also restore settings from your computer after resetting the settings for 
an Apple TV. To reset the settings in your Apple TV, choose Settings➪General➪
Reset Settings. You can then choose Reset Settings to reset your preferences 
without changing network configuration or syncing settings. 
To restore your settings, connect your new, restored, or reset iPod touch 
or iPhone to the same computer you used before. For Apple TV, unplug 
Apple TV from the power outlet, wait 30 seconds, and plug Apple TV back in. 
iTunes should open automatically (if not, open iTunes). Follow the on-screen 
instructions to restore your settings. 
To delete the backed-up settings for your iPod touch, iPhone, or Apple TV, 
open iTunes and choose iTunes➪Preferences (on a Mac) or Edit➪Preferences 
(on a Windows PC). Click the Syncing tab; select the iPod touch, iPhone, or 
Apple TV in the Syncing window; and click Remove Backup. You don’t need 
to connect your iPod touch or iPhone.

 Chapter 20: Updating and Troubleshooting
Restoring to factory conditions
Restoring an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV erases its storage and returns the 
device to its factory settings. To restore an iPod or iPhone, follow these steps 
for both the Mac and Windows versions of iTunes:
 
1. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer.
 
 iTunes opens automatically.
 
2. Select the iPod or iPhone in the Devices section of the Source pane, 
and click the Summary tab (Settings tab for an iPod shuffle) if it is not 
already selected.
 
 The device’s Summary (or Settings) page appears to the right of the 
Source pane.
 
3. Click the Restore button.
 
 An alert dialog appears to confirm that you want to restore the device.
 
4. Click the Restore button again to confirm the restore operation.
 
 A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation.
 
5. For some iPod models, follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod 
and connect it to an AC power adapter, if required.
 
 You might need to disconnect an iPod temporarily and connect it to an 
AC power adapter after the restore operation and during the process of 
updating the software. If you see a message asking you to disconnect the 
iPod, follow the instructions displayed with the message. You might also 
need to reconnect the iPod to the computer after this process.
 
 iTunes notifies you when the restore is finished.
 
6. Synchronize your iPod or iPhone with content from your iTunes 
library.
 
 Synchronize your iPod or iPhone with the content in your library, or 
manually manage your content, as I describe in Chapter 11. 
 
 
7. When you finish synchronizing the iPod or iPhone with content and 
data, eject the device by clicking the Eject button next to its name in 
the Source pane.
To restore your Apple TV, press and hold both Menu and Menu down/scroll 
(-) on the Apple Remote for six seconds or until the status light blinks amber. 
Then use your Apple Remote to choose a language on the Apple TV, and then 
choose Factory Restore. You can also restore your Apple TV by using your 
Apple Remote to choose Settings➪General➪Reset Settings from the main 
menu and then choosing Factory Restore.

U
nfortunately, humans — as well as the machines that they make — are 
not perfect. Even though I think that the iPod and the iPhone come as 
close to perfection as possible, at some point, your iPod or iPhone isn’t going 
to work like you expect it to. When that happens, you can turn to this chap-
ter. Here I show you how to fix the most common problems.
How Do I Get My iPod or 
iPhone to Wake Up?
If your iPod or iPhone doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. Try the 
following suggestions to get your iPod or iPhone to respond:
 
 For iPod classic, nano, and all older models (before the sixth genera-
tion), check the Hold switch position on top of the iPod. The Hold 
switch locks the iPod buttons so you don’t accidentally activate them. 
Slide the Hold switch away from the headphone connection, hiding the 
orange layer, to unlock the buttons. (There is no hold button on current 
iPod shuffle models; check the Off switch and slide it to the on position.)
 
 For iPod touch and iPhone models, press the Home button or the 
Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button on the top.

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 See whether the iPod or iPhone has enough juice. Is the battery 
charged? Connect the iPod or iPhone to a power source and see whether 
it works.
 
 Reset your iPod or iPhone if it still doesn’t turn on. See Chapter 20 for 
resetting instructions.
If your iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its battery by con-
necting it to the USB connection on your computer. If the iPod shuffle status 
light blinks orange when you press a button, the buttons are disabled. Press 
and hold the Play/Pause button for at least three seconds or until the status 
light blinks green.
How Do I Get My Battery 
to Last Longer?
You can do a lot to keep your battery going longer (much to the envy of your 
friends), including the following:
 
 Press the Play/Pause button to pause (stop) playback. Don’t just turn 
off your car or home stereo or remove your headphones because if you 
don’t also pause playback, your iPod or iPhone continues playing until 
the playlist or album ends. When playback is paused, the power-save 
feature automatically turns off an iPod after two minutes of inactivity. 
(You have to turn off an iPhone or iPod touch manually.)
 
 Turn off the iPod or iPhone when you’re not using it. Rather than wait-
ing for for the power-save feature to turn off the iPod, turn it off yourself 
to save battery time. For iPod classic, nano, and all older models (pre-
sixth generation), press and hold the Play/Pause button to turn it off. 
You can put the iPhone or iPod touch into standby “sleep” mode (in 
which the display is off and power slows to a tiny trickle) by pressing 
the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button on the top. You can turn the iPhone or 
iPod touch completely off by pressing the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button 
again. Note that starting up an iPhone or iPod touch takes quite a bit of 
power — you should do that while it’s plugged into AC power or your 
computer.
 
 Turn off backlighting or turn down brightness. If you don’t need to 
use backlighting to see your display on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or 
older model, turn it off because it drains battery power if the iPod isn’t 
plugged into a power source. Turn down the brightness on an iPod 
touch or iPhone by choosing Settings➪Brightness and dragging the 
brightness slider to the left.

357
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Solutions
 
 Turn off Wi-Fi (iPhone or iPod touch). Turn off Wi-Fi (choose Settings➪
Wi-Fi and touch the On button to turn it off) when you’re not brows-
ing the Internet. Also, check e-mail less frequently (see Chapter 16 for 
details). 
 
 Turn off Bluetooth (iPhone). On an iPhone, turn off Bluetooth (choose 
Settings➪General➪Bluetooth and touch the On button to turn it off) if 
you’re not using a Bluetooth device.
 
 Set the Hold switch to the locked position when you’re not using your 
iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model). Keep the controls locked 
so that they don’t accidentally get turned on when you’re not using your 
iPod.
How Do I Keep My Scroll Wheel or 
Touch Display from Going Crazy?
Occasionally, an iPhone or iPod touch display or an iPod scroll wheel stops 
working properly. If the scroll wheel doesn’t scroll or the touch display is no 
longer sensitive (or is too sensitive, reacting crazily), try resetting the iPod or 
iPhone, as described in Chapter 20. Remember: Resetting the iPod or iPhone 
doesn’t change its contents. After resetting, the iPod or iPhone should work 
properly.
Second- and third-generation iPods use a nonmoving scroll wheel that works 
like a trackpad (also sometimes called a touchpad) of a laptop computer. 
The trackpad-style scroll wheel is far better than the first-generation moving 
wheel, which could be hampered by sand or dirt and had moving parts that 
could be damaged. However, it has problems of its own: It goes crazy some-
times, and it can be very sensitive (not necessarily to criticism, but to the 
touch of your finger).
The trackpad-style scroll wheel translates the electrical charge from your 
finger into movement on the iPod display. If you accidentally use more than 
one finger, the scroll wheel might misread the signal and skip over selections 
or go backward while scrolling forward, and so on. Maintenance tip: If the 
scroll wheel has excessive moisture on it from humidity or a wet hand, wipe 
the wheel with a soft, dry cloth.
 
Don’t use pencil erasers, pen caps, or other types of pointers to scroll the 
scroll wheel. They won’t work with trackpad-style scroll wheels, and using 
them might damage other types of scroll wheels. Also, don’t scroll with fingers 
sporting rings or a hand with a heavy bracelet or similar jewelry because the 
metals can throw off the sensors in the scroll wheel.

358
Part V: The Part of Tens 
How Do I Get My Computer to 
Recognize My iPod or iPhone?
If you can’t get your computer to recognize your iPod or iPhone, make sure 
that your iPod or iPhone is securely connected to your computer’s USB 
connection (or FireWire connection in older models), and that it is the only 
device using that connection. If you use a hub to share devices, try not using 
the hub to see whether it works without the hub.
 
If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, go to the tips section of the author’s Web 
site (www.tonybove.com) for more troubleshooting tips.
Also, make sure that your USB or FireWire cable is in good condition for 
connecting to your computer. For older-model iPods that work with either 
FireWire or USB, try one type of connection or the other; if one connection 
type works but not the other, the problem is probably not in your iPod. Try 
connecting your iPod to another computer by using the same type of connec-
tion to see whether the same problem occurs. (Your computer might be to 
blame.)
If the same type of connection (FireWire or USB) to the other computer 
works, the problem is most likely your computer’s connection or software. 
If the same type of connection doesn’t work, the problem is most likely your 
cable or connection. You can try a new cable to see whether that works or 
try the same type of connection with a different computer. Even if these sug-
gestions seem obvious, doing them in the correct order can help you diag-
nose the problem.
What Are These Strange 
Icons on My iPod?
If you see an icon of a circle with a diagonal line across it, you should also see 
the words Do not disconnect. Don’t do anything until the iPod finishes its 
update and displays the main menu or the OK to disconnect message. If 
this symbol stays on for a very, very long time (like, 20 minutes), try resetting 
the iPod, as described in Chapter 20.
Other strange icons might appear. When you turn on your iPod, built-in diag-
nostic software checks the iPod. If the iPod finds a problem when it’s turned 
on, it automatically uses internal diagnostics to check for and repair any 

359
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Solutions
damage. You might see a disk folder icon on your iPod screen after turning it 
on, indicating that a problem was fixed. If this happens, restore your iPod to 
its factory condition (see Chapter 20) and reload content into it.
If the iPod displays any other strange icon, such as a backward Apple logo, a 
disk icon with a flashing question mark, or the dreaded disk-with-magnifying 
glass icon, the device might need to be repaired. If you get the “sad iPod” 
icon (with a frown and asterisks for eyes) or the folder icon with an exclama-
tion point, try the troubleshooting steps in Chapter 20. If nothing seems to 
work, the iPod probably needs to be repaired. You can arrange for repair by 
visiting the Apple support site for the iPod (www.apple.com/support/
ipod).
How Do I Restore My iPod or iPhone 
to Its Factory Condition?
Restoring an iPod or iPhone erases its storage and returns the device to its 
factory condition. You can use iTunes to restore your iPod or iPhone, as I 
describe in Chapter 20. When finished, resynchronize your content and per-
sonal information back to your iPod or iPhone using iTunes.
How Do I Update My iPod 
or iPhone Software?
To determine which software version is installed on your iPod classic or 
nano models, press the Menu button until you see the iPod main menu. Then 
choose Settings➪About; in earlier versions, choose Settings➪Info. Look at the 
version number that describes the software version installed on your iPod.
To see which version of the software you are using in your iPhone or iPod 
touch, choose Settings➪General➪About, and the version number appears 
next to the Version heading.
You can use iTunes to automatically check which software version you’re 
using and to update or restore your iPod or iPhone (see Chapter 20).

360
Part V: The Part of Tens 
How Do I Synchronize My iPod or 
iPhone When My Library Is Larger 
Than Its Capacity?
If you have less space on your iPod or iPhone than content in your iTunes 
library, you can synchronize selected content only, or you can manually 
manage music and videos on your iPod or iPhone. You can also select spe-
cific photo albums or videos, or select specific playlists, rather than copying 
everything.
When you synchronize by playlist, you can create playlists exclusively for 
your iPod or iPhone. You can also limit a smart playlist to a certain size: for 
example, 3.7GB (for a 4GB iPod nano).
 
By combining the features of smart playlists (Chapter 10) and synchronizing 
by playlist (Chapter 11), you can control how much of your iTunes library con-
tent is copied to and deleted from your iPod or iPhone. 
 
You can even create multiple iTunes libraries — including sub-libraries, based 
on your complete library — that you can set up so you can automatically syn-
chronize different iPods. To learn how, visit this book’s companion Web site.
You can also keep your iPod or iPhone synchronized to a subset of your 
library based on ratings. iTunes creates a new playlist specially designed for 
updating your iPod or iPhone automatically — a smart playlist named “your 
iPod/iPhone name Selection.” iTunes decides which songs and albums to 
include in this playlist by using the ratings that you can set for each song in 
the iTunes song information, as I describe in Chapter 9.
How Do I Cross-Fade Music Playback 
with My iPod or iPhone?
You can fade the ending of one song into the beginning of the next one 
to slightly overlap songs, just like a radio DJ, when you use iTunes — see 
Chapter 6. The cross-fade setting is the amount of time between the end of the 
fade-out from the first song and the start of the fade-in to the second song.
To cross-fade songs on your iPod nano or iPod classic, choose Settings➪
Playback➪Audio Crossfade and select On.

361
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Solutions
You can also cross-fade songs when playing your iPod or iPhone through 
iTunes on your computer. To do this, you must first use iTunes to set the 
iPod or iPhone to manually manage content, as I describe in Chapter 11. If 
you’re playing songs on an iPod or iPhone that’s connected to your computer 
and also playing songs from your iTunes library (or even on a second iPod or 
iPhone, both connected to your computer), your songs cross-fade automati-
cally if you set the Crossfade Playback option.
To change the Crossfade Playback option in iTunes, choose iTunes➪
Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows) and then click the 
Playback tab. You can then increase or decrease the amount of the cross-
fade. See Chapter 6 for details.
 
For complete instructions on how to play your iPod or iPhone songs through 
iTunes on your computer, visit this book’s companion Web site.
How Do I Decrease Distortion 
or Set a Lower Volume?
iPod and iPhone models have a tiny but powerful amplifier to deliver audio 
signals through the headphone connection. The amplifier has a frequency 
response of 20 hertz (Hz) to 20 kilohertz (kHz), which provides distortion-
free music at the lowest or highest pitches, but the amplifier might cause 
 distortion — and possibly ear drum damage — at maximum volume depend-
ing on the recorded material.
For optimal sound quality, set the iPod or iPhone volume to no more than 
three-quarters of the maximum volume and adjust your listening volume 
by using the volume control or equivalent on your car stereo or portable 
speaker system. (If no volume control exists, you have no choice but to con-
trol the volume from the iPod or iPhone.) By lowering the iPod or iPhone 
from maximum volume, you give your ears a break and also prevent over-
amplification, which can cause distortion and reduce audio quality. See 
Chapter 14 for details on how to set the iPod or iPhone volume limit and 
adjust the iPod or iPhone volume.

Eleven Tips for the Equalizer
In This Chapter
 Adjusting the equalizer on your home stereo
 Taking advantage of the iPod equalizer preset
 Getting rid of unwanted noise
You play your iPod or iPhone in many environments, but the song that 
sounds like music to your ears in your car might sound like screeching 
hyenas when you’re on a plane. In this chapter, I show you how to fix most 
sound problems that occur with iPods and iPhones. Soon, you’ll be cruising 
to the beat all the time — no matter where you are.
To select an iPod equalizer preset with sixth-generation or older-model 
iPods, choose Settings➪EQ from the main menu to display a list of presets. 
With the iPod touch, choose Settings from the home menu, and choose EQ 
to display a list of presets. With the iPhone, choose Settings from the home 
menu, choose iPod from the Settings menu, and then choose EQ to display 
a list of presets. You can then scroll the list of presets and select one. The 
equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets. For more informa-
tion about using the iTunes and iPod equalizers, see Chapter 13.
Setting the Volume to the Right Level
Before using the equalizer in an iPod or iPhone to refine the sound, make 
sure the volume of the iPod or iPhone is set to no more than about half or 
three-quarters of its max so you don’t introduce distortion. (See Chapter 14 
for details on how to set the volume limit and also adjust volume.) Then set 
your speaker system or home stereo volume before trying to refine the sound 
with equalizers.

364
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Adjusting Another Equalizer
When you have the iPod or iPhone connected to another system with an 
equalizer, try adjusting that equalizer first:
 
 Home stereo system: Refine the sound with your home stereo equalizer 
because that can be set precisely for the listening environment and might 
offer more flexibility.
 
 Car stereos: The same rule applies as with your home stereo: Adjust the 
car stereo equalizer when you begin to listen to music on your iPod or 
iPhone — before adjusting your iPod or iPhone equalizer.
Setting Booster Presets
When playing music with your iPod or iPhone through a home stereo or 
speakers (without a built-in equalizer) in a heavily draped and furnished 
room, try using the Treble Booster equalizer preset or create your own equal-
izer preset that raises the frequencies above 1 kilohertz (kHz). Boosting these 
higher frequencies makes the music sound naturally alive.
 
To learn how to create your own equalizer presets, see this book’s companion 
Web site.
Reducing High Frequencies
When using your iPod or iPhone to play music through a home stereo (with-
out a built-in equalizer) in a room with smooth, hard walls and concrete 
floors, you might want to use the Treble Reducer equalizer preset, which 
reduces the high frequencies to make the sound less brittle.
Increasing Low Frequencies
If you use high-quality, acoustic-suspension compact speakers, you might 
need to add a boost to the low frequencies (bass) with the Bass Booster 
equalizer preset so that you can boogie with the beat a little better. The Small 
Speakers equalizer preset also boosts the low frequencies and lowers the 
high frequencies to give you a fuller sound.

365
 Chapter 22: Eleven Tips for the Equalizer
Setting Presets for Trucks and SUVs
I have used an iPod in different types of cars, such as a sedan and a four-
wheel-drive truck. Trucks need more bass and treble, and the Rock equalizer 
preset sounds good for most of the music that I listen to. I also recommend 
using the Bass Booster equalizer preset when using an iPod or iPhone in a 
truck if the Rock preset doesn’t boost the bass enough. In a sedan, an iPod 
or iPhone sounds fine to me without any equalizer adjustment.
Setting Presets When You’re 
Eight Miles High
When using your iPod or iPhone on an airplane where jet noise is a factor, 
try using the Bass Booster equalizer preset to hear the lower frequencies in 
your headphones and compensate for the deficiencies of headphones in loud 
environments. You might want to use the Classical equalizer preset, which 
boosts both the high and low frequencies for extra treble and bass. Try the 
Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones (www.bose.
com) for plane travel — they work better than all others I’ve tried, but they’re 
pricey at about $350. You can still pick up the Bose QuietComfort 2 (previous 
model) from Amazon.com for $299, which is just as good. While there are 
many “noise canceling” headphones on the market, you have to try them first 
in a noisy environment to see whether they work to your satisfaction. 
 
If you’re in an unpressurized environment at or above 10,000 feet — such as 
on a mountain peak — don’t try to use an iPod classic or older model iPod. 
Leave it turned off. Like many laptops, these models use hard drives that can 
fail if operated at altitudes above 10,000 feet. The drive heads float above the 
recording surface on a small cushion of air produced by the spinning platters. 
If the air is too thin to create this cushion, the heads may contact the surface, 
possibly even damaging it.
Reducing Tape Noise and Scratch Sounds
To reduce the hiss of an old recording or the scratchy sound of songs 
recorded from a record, reduce the highest frequencies with the Treble 
Reducer equalizer preset.

366
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Reducing Turntable Rumble and Hum
To reduce the low-frequency rumble you sometimes hear in songs recorded 
from a turntable as well as that humming sound (when unwanted noise from 
the turntable’s power supply bleeds into the recording), choose the Bass 
Reducer equalizer preset.
Reducing Off-Frequency Harshness 
and Nasal Vocals
To reduce a particularly nasal vocal sound reminiscent of Donald Duck (caused 
by off-frequency recording of the song source, making the song more harsh-
sounding), try using the R&B equalizer preset, which reduces the midrange 
frequencies while boosting all the other frequencies.
Cranking Up the Volume to Eleven
If you want that larger-than-life sound, use the Loudness preset and then jack 
up the Preamp slider to the max, turn your stereo all the way up, and put 
your fingers in your ears to protect them. Then consult the DVD This Is Spinal 
Tap or the Spinal Tap fan site at http://spinaltapfan.com.
