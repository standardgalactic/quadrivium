Introduction      1
Introduction
W
elcome to the wonderful, wacky, and yes, sometimes 
scary, world of dadhood! Being a dad starts before you 
ever see your baby’s face and doesn’t end until . . . well, 
it never actually ends.
This book starts at the very beginning and assumes you want to 
know what’s going to happen for the next few years, at least. After 
all, once you’ve been a dad for a few years, what more is there to 
learn? Plenty, of course, but we don’t want to overwhelm you, so 
we concentrate on the first 7 or 8 years.
We wrote this book because we either love being a dad (three of 
us) or we love the dads in our own lives (the other one of us). We 
want to see dads succeed, because a good dad can have a huge 
impact on a little one’s life. We also want you to have fun being 
a dad, because there’s more to being a dad than worrying about 
potty training, good schools, and whether or not your kiddo is 
good at sports.
Being a dad is an adventure, and we’re happy to accompany you 
through the first few years.
About This Book
One of the best things about a For Dummies book is that we assume 
you’re interested in knowing what you really need to know, with-
out a lot of extra stuff thrown in. But because some guys really 
do want more detail, we include some extra info in the sidebars, 
which are shaded boxes. Feel free to read these if you want to dig 
a little deeper or to skip them if you want just the facts for now.
Keep in mind that this book is a reference book, so you don’t have 
to read this book in order (unless you want to!); just use the table 
of contents and the index to help you find what you’re looking for. 
You can dip into and out of chapters as you like.

Within this book, you may note that some web addresses break 
across two lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and 
want to visit one of these web pages, simply key in the web 
address exactly as it’s noted in the text, pretending as though 
the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as an e-book, 
you’ve got it easy — just click the web address to be taken directly 
to the web page.
Foolish Assumptions
If you’re reading this book, we assume you’re either a dad, going 
to be a dad, or want to be a dad in the future. That doesn’t mean 
that moms can’t read this book — you can, because there’s lots of 
information here that applies to both parents. If you’re a grand-

Beyond the Book
No book can cover everything there is to know on a topic. For that 
reason — and because you may not want to carry this book with 
you everywhere — we’ve created an online source you can turn 
to for some quick bites of essential information. To get this Cheat 
Sheet, simply go to www.dummies.com and search for “Dad’s Guide 
to Baby’s First Year For Dummies Cheat Sheet” in the Search box.
The Cheat Sheet for this book includes such valuable information 
as a step-by-step guide to changing a diaper — dads aren’t born 
knowing this stuff, after all — some suggestions on soothing a 
crying baby, and best of all, ideas on how to have fun with your 
baby and toddler.
Where to Go from Here
While being a dad starts at the beginning and moves forward year 
by year, you don’t have to approach this book that way. You might 
be in the throes of choosing a school right now and have very 
little interest in reading about potty training. That’s fine — start 
with whichever chapter interests you at the moment. If you’re a 
straight-through type of guy, feel free to start with page 1 and 
keep going. But for everyone else, skipping ahead to the sections 
that address your immediate concerns is just fine.

Fatherhood
R
ight now, somewhere across the globe, someone is becom-
ing a father. He may be suited up in scrubs as his child is 
delivered by cesarean in a high-tech delivery suite, or hold-
ing his partner’s hand as she gives birth in a pool at home. He 
may be pacing at the neighbors’ hut in a village somewhere in the 
third world as his wife gives birth surrounded only by women, or 
heading through rush-hour traffic to get to the hospital on time. 
Wherever these dads-to-be are, they all have one thing in com-
mon. When they lay eyes on their new little baby, they know life 
will never be the same.
There’s something about becoming a father that’s universal. For 
ages, you’ve been just yourself: Building a career, buying a house, 
perhaps traveling and seeing the world. You’ve concentrated on 
becoming a person in your own right — an individual. You’ve had 
wild days and adventures; you’ve been places. Those are all great 
things to do with your life. But when you have a child, you begin 
a whole new adventure — one that doesn’t end when your visa 
runs out or the bar closes. Your new adventure is lifelong. Being 
a father makes you think of your own father and all the fathers 
who came before him, and you realize you’re something bigger

than just a stamped passport and some good stories around the 
campfire — you’re a bona fide member of the human race, a piece 
in a puzzle that has been put together over many generations. And 
there’s a part of you that will go on into the next generation, and 
then hopefully the next and the next.
In this chapter, we explore what it means to be a father and talk 
about the reality of being a dad. The role of fathers has changed 
a lot in just the generation between our fathers and us. Dads 
are more involved, but they also have a lot more stress — work 
commitments, financial pressure, separation from partners, and 
information overload. But fear not — in this chapter and in the 
rest of this book, we keep fatherhood real with practical informa-
tion, useful explanations, and a bit of humor. After all, children 
are lots and lots of fun, so why make the journey to fatherhood 
more serious than it needs to be?
Dispelling Common Myths 
about Fatherhood
Toward the end of the 20th century, we experienced a revival of 
fatherhood and the dawn of a new generation of dads — a genera-
tion of dads who are no longer content playing a supporting role 
in the upbringing of their children. Dads want to experience par-
enting fully, warts and all. Some brave dads are even taking over 
and sending mom back to the workforce. The number of stay-at- 
home dads is increasing year by year in most Western societies, a 
clear sign that something fundamental is changing about how we 
bring up our children and organize our lives. (If you’re thinking 
about becoming a stay-at-home dad, we have lots of advice and 
practical tips for taking on your new role in Chapter 16.)
However, despite the generation of new dads, many dads are still 
faced with a few persistent stereotypes:
»
» Fathers are completely useless when it comes to looking 
after babies and children. That’s nonsense. Yes, dads parent 
differently from moms, but male ways of doing things are just 

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      9
as valid and important. Research shows that fathers are just 
as good as mothers at caring for babies, responding to their 
needs and temperaments, and learning how to read babies’ 
cues. Research also shows that children with involved dads 
do better in school and are more confident and independent 
later in life. Unfortunately, fathers have effectively been cut 
off from getting involved through preconceived ideas about 
parenting, peer pressure, or the demands of the modern 
workplace. The good news is most dads in the 21st century 
now have the option to do it differently and show the world 
that dads make fantastic caregivers.
»
» Fathers don’t have to do any of the day-to-day care that 
babies and children require. This may be true if you want 
to remain in the dark ages of fatherhood. Twenty-first 
century dads do caregiving because there’s an important 
reason for it: The best way to bond with your newborn child 
is by taking part in all that day-to-day stuff. Changing a 
diaper, trimming his nails, and tucking him into bed each 
night aren’t just jobs that need to be done; they’re a way for 
your baby and children to spend a bit of time with you and 
get to know you. Your child will learn that when he needs 
something, you’re there to take care of him, make him feel 
better, and comfort him when he’s ill or teething, or just 
because he needs a hug. He’ll learn words from you as you 
chat to him while he’s in the bath, learn how to put clothes on 
from the way you dress him each morning, and learn all sorts 
of other good qualities simply from the way you are. You also 
brighten up his world no end with all the silly things you do.
»
» Moms laugh at dads when they’re out with babies by 
themselves. Maybe — but mostly because they probably 
find you really cute with your little one strapped to your 
chest! In most cases, women will flock from all corners of the 
room when you walk into that playgroup with baby on your 
shoulder. If you get the occasional overly “helpful” mom in 
the supermarket who doesn’t think you quite know how to 
handle a crying baby, be confident that you can demonstrate 
who’s daddy by settling your little one in one minute flat.
»
» Fathers don’t have a social life. Wrong — fathers (and all 
parents) have a different social life. You may have to invest a 
bit of time and thought into how you’ll manage going out or 

10      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
taking part in sports. But these things can all be organized. 
After all, dads are fantastic at organizing. It takes a while 
getting used to having an extra person in your life, but that 
doesn’t mean you’ll never be able to go out again. Chapter 8 
provides hints and tips for getting out and about, with and 
without your little one.
»
» As a dad you don’t have a sex life anymore. Actually that 
one is kind of true, but only temporarily. The birthing 
experience, sheer exhaustion, and practicalities of looking 
after a newborn can make it somewhat tricky to get back to 
your pre-baby sex life with your partner. The word here is 
patience. Your sex life will return (check out Chapters 6 and 8 
for more on this subject). But you may just have to be a bit 
more creative now that your little one is in the house.
The pros and cons of fatherhood
As with every life decision or change, there are good things and 
challenges. If you want to take a rational approach to fatherhood, 
consider the following.
On the plus side:
»
» Fathers report their lives are more meaningful than before 
they had a child.
»
» Fatherhood can make you a more compassionate, mature, 
and confident person.
»
» You get to be a child all over again (yes, you get to play with 
cool toys and teach your child lots of silly tricks).
»
» Being a father is a chance for you to hand down skills and 
values from your family. This will feel very good when you’re 
nearing your final days.
»
» You’ll probably for the first time in your life truly understand 
your own father.
»
» You get a real kick out of raising a child well and seeing her 
achieve lots of things.

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      11
The challenges:
»
» Until around three months of age, newborn babies are a real 
handful. They cry, sometimes for no apparent reason at all, 
and you feel like the sound is piercing your brain. There’s a 
reason recordings of crying babies are used as torture. 
Chapter 6 provides helpful hints about settling a newborn 
and coping with crying.
»
» Sleep deprivation is also a well-known torture technique. 
Fathers of babies under a year old typically get 42 minutes 
less sleep a night than other men. Doesn’t sound like much, 
but it adds up. For ways to deal with sleep deprivation, see 
Chapter 8.
»
» You’ll have less time for yourself and making plans really 
does mean making plans — spontaneity goes out the 
window a bit at the beginning. Check out Chapter 8 for ways 
to get out and about.
We think the upsides of fatherhood far outweigh the downsides, 
especially because most of the really annoying aspects (like sleep 
deprivation) get much easier the older your children get.
A sad reality for a small percentage of fathers in the United States 
is that they may not get the chance to experience all the joys that 
fatherhood has to offer. Though we don’t often talk about it in 
our society, miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, and death in 
infancy are terrible losses for some fathers to bear. Others have to 
deal with the fact that their child, so full of promise and hope, has a 
serious illness or disability that forces them to shift expectations of 
what being a father is all about. We talk more about these issues in 
Chapters 17 and 18 with lots of information and support for parents.
Knowing what to expect
Asking someone to tell you what being a father is like is a bit 
like asking how long a piece of string is. Answering that ques-
tion is impossible. Like the uniqueness of your child’s DNA, every 
father’s experience is different. A good way to get an idea of what 
fatherhood is like is to spend some time with friends who have 
recently had a baby. Talk to your own parents too.

12      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Here are some common factors that most fathers face:
»
» Sharing your partner’s body with your child before and after 
birth can feel a bit weird. Sex during pregnancy can be 
brilliant or a bit challenging, depending on your partner’s 
experience. (See Chapter 3 for more about sex during 
pregnancy.) In addition, after giving birth some women aren’t 
into sharing their boobs with you and baby too.
»
» Sleep becomes a big issue. Babies don’t understand that day 
is for being awake and night is for being asleep. Over time, 
your baby will adjust and eventually sleep through the 
night — the holy grail for most parents. But a baby who does 
this before six months of age is rare. Babies also need 
nutrition every few hours to grow, so if your baby is waking 
up in the night for feedings, consider it a good thing that he’s 
thriving and growing. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 discuss feeding 
your baby and getting him to sleep.
»
» Expect to feel frightened, scared, overwhelmed, and some-
times lost as you navigate fatherhood. Just changing a diaper 
for the first time or getting clothes on a newborn feels 
awkward and wrong when you’re new at it. So what — moms 
and all other dads who get involved have the same experience.
»
» You’ll do things that you never thought you’d do, you’ll laugh 
at things that seem completely ridiculous to you right now, 
and you may cry at times that you least expect. You’ll also 
learn lots about yourself and experience things that you 
cannot experience any other way. Fatherhood is truly an 
adventure.
Being a father is a lot about acceptance and going with the flow. 
A useful mantra to remember is “this too will pass,” as every ill-
ness, teething episode, period of sleep deprivation, or colic will 
pass. Looking after a baby teaches you a lot about life, and you 
may find that you’re more relaxed, confident, and happy as a 
result of having a child.
Parenting, for both fathers and mothers, requires a certain amount 
of letting go. When a baby is born, we want things for our child: 
The best of everything, and every opportunity and good thing in 

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      13
life that may come her way. You naturally want her to avoid the 
mistakes you made in your own life. But it doesn’t work that way.
Your child is not an extension of you; your baby is her own per-
son. She’ll grow up to have her own ideas, her own interests, and 
her own strengths, and they may be vastly different from yours. 
You may want her to be a lawyer so she has money to pay for 
things you could only dream of, but what really makes her happy 
is working with animals or in a charity. Sometimes you just have 
to admit that father doesn’t know best. You may be disappointed, 
but it’s her life, and only she can live it. Support her — that’s 
what great dads are for.
Trading in your lifestyle  
(but not the sports car)
Well, actually, we hate to say it, but you may have to trade in the 
sports car too. Becoming a father is about changing your state of 
mind and changing the idea of what’s important to you. As a dad, 
the car’s less about the ultimate drive and more about keeping 
your child safe and fitting the stroller in the back. Chapter 4 helps 
you negotiate safe transport for your baby, as well as what sort of 
stroller to get.
If you want a baby but don’t want to change the way you live your 
life, you’re probably better off waiting for a while to have chil-
dren. Some things will inevitably change:
»
» Your work: If you want to spend time with your family, you 
may consider working fewer hours or changing to a flexible 
working arrangement that you can negotiate with your 
employer. See Chapter 6 for more about finding a work–life 
balance.
You may even decide to give up work and be the primary 
caregiver to your child, making you a stay-at-home dad 
(SAHD). If this sounds like you, see Chapter 16 for more 
information. This book is written with the philosophy that 
dads, just as much as moms, take part in the day-to-day care 
of a child, so we’ve left out nothing about how to look after 
your little one.

14      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» Your freedom: Doing things when and where you want 
doesn’t work when you’ve got a baby. If the swell is perfect 
and you just feel like going out for a surf, you may have to 
wait until baby is asleep or take him and mom along with 
you. It’s the same with spending time out and about with 
your partner. Going out to dinner and a movie is no longer a 
spontaneous activity; it requires planning. Finding time for 
yourself alongside work and family commitments is one of 
the biggest challenges fathers face. Chapter 8 gives you ideas 
for getting out and about after your baby arrives.
»
» Your finances: If you both had an income before your child 
came along, you’ll be down to one income for a while. If you 
lived in a one-bedroom apartment, it’s time to find some-
where bigger and a way to pay for it. We offer some tips on 
how to reduce the cost of caring for your child in Chapter 12.
»
» Your friends and family: Your relationship with friends and 
family will change. If you live away from your parents, you’ll 
probably find yourself having to spend a lot more time 
traveling to visit them more often. Some of your childless 
friends will really embrace you having a child and will 
become the fun aunt or uncle your child gets excited 
about seeing. Others will not be so keen on kids — even 
yours! — and you’ll see them less as a result.
»
» Your vacations: Going on vacation takes on a whole new 
meaning. You’ll definitely have to postpone that backpacking 
trip around South America for a few years, at least until your 
kids are big enough to trudge alongside you. Family vaca-
tions are different — great fun, but unlike any vacation 
you’ve had since you were a child. Chapter 9 gives you some 
great ideas for how to manage a trip with baby in tow.
»
» Your lifestyle: Risky lifestyle or sport activities like base 
jumping and free climbing are no longer just about risking 
your own life. You now have to consider the future of your 
child and family.
»
» Your health and behavior: A child is one of the ultimate 
reasons to change some unhealthy habits like smoking, 
heavy drinking, eating junk food, and being a slob. Children 
need a smoke-free environment to breathe in, good healthy 
food, clean clothes and diapers, and good hygiene to prevent 

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      15
illness. And who needs to grow up hearing language that 
might make a sailor blush? If you’re a little lost when it comes 
to health and nutrition, we give you the goods in Chapter 14, 
where you’ll find out about everything from what your child 
should be eating to exercising together.
Only Fools Rush In
Sometimes you can plan when you have a child; sometimes 
nature has her own ideas. Either way, fatherhood is a big deal — 
fatherhood’s not like buying a new pair of shoes or getting a 
plant. Your child, if you decide to have one, has only one shot at 
life, and he deserves the best start you can give him. A committed, 
involved, and reliable father is a big part of that. If you’re being 
pushed into having a child by your partner, talk it through with 
her; don’t just go along with it because you’re afraid of the dis-
cussion. Becoming a dad is an important step in life, so take some 
time to figure out how you feel about it and share your thoughts 
with your partner.
Hey, I’m not ready for this
How often in your life can you say you’re really ready for some-
thing? Not often. Fatherhood, of all things, is probably the most 
difficult to feel truly ready for. Even if you’ve been planning to 
have a child, spent months going through IVF (see Chapter 2 for 
more about this), and been dreaming of the day you hold your 
child in your arms, the sledgehammer of reality will probably 
whack you over the head the day you find out you’re really going 
to be a dad.
If your partner is already pregnant but you don’t feel ready for 
fatherhood, you’ve got time on your side. In the coming months, 
as your baby grows and gets ready for birth, spend some time 
with other people’s children, talk to other fathers, and let yourself 
ease into the idea of fatherhood. Think about the kind of father 
your dad is and what you’ve learned from him. Think of all the 
things you would do differently.

16      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
If you’re really, truly not ready for fatherhood as the birth 
approaches, it may help if you talk to someone about your fears. 
Your healthcare provider can put you in touch with a counselor.
You can find a counselor yourself by looking on the Internet, but 
asking other people for recommendations, if you’re comfortable 
doing it, is a better way to find someone who is on your same 
wavelength. A pastor or other spiritual advisor, if you have one, 
can also help you find the right person — or, in some cases, could 
actually be the right person to talk to.
Don’t forget to talk to your partner about what you’re feeling. 
After all, you are in this together, so it helps to share your feelings 
and thoughts with her.
Although having children can be the most amazing and joyous 
adventure, the strains of work, family, and other commitments 
can put a lot of pressure on a relationship. Unfortunately, many 
relationships don’t survive this extra pressure. In Chapter 19, we 
talk about how fathers can cope with divorce and separation and 
still continue to be great dads.
My partner wants a baby
You’re faced with a sticky situation — your partner is ready to 
have a baby, her biological clock is ticking, all her friends have 
babies, and she’s eager to join the club. But you’re not.
Here’s our advice: Rather than fight the idea of becoming a 
parent — moan, whine, or try to ignore it until it goes away — 
give the idea of fatherhood some serious thought. Talk about it 
together with your partner, explain why you’re not ready, but 
equally, listen to her point of view. Imagine yourself as a dad — 
how does that feel?
Mull it over. Where do you want to be in ten years? Dad to a child 
(or four) with the rewards that brings? Or still living a childless 
life with the freedom that brings? When you look back on your life 
in your old age, do you want children and family to be part of it?
You may feel like there’s never a good time to have children or you 
just don’t feel ready. Perhaps you’re quite clear that you definitely 

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      17
don’t want children. Cool, but then you also owe it to your partner 
to let her know.
Timing isn’t always everything
Sometimes, despite thinking that you’ll wait to have a family 
until after a big project is completed, or you’ve found a bigger 
house, or until you’ve been on that trekking trip to Nepal, nature 
jumps the gun. Your partner sits you down and says she’s preg-
nant. Wow — you’re going to be a dad. The key is to not panic. 
Freak out maybe, but don’t panic (mostly because it takes a while 
for the baby to arrive). Okay, so you haven’t painted the roof or 
skydived yet. Well, you never wanted to be one of those “boring 
older people” anyway, so there are still plenty of opportunities 
to do whatever you want to do, perhaps even with your children. 
Fatherhood doesn’t mean you suddenly have to stay home every 
night whittling on the front porch; it just means the pace of life 
you live ticks along to a different clock.
Introducing the  
New-Generation Dad
Fathers today are a quantum leap from the previous generation of 
fathers. Twenty-first-century dads push strollers, get up for night 
feedings, change diapers, and have tried and tested burping tech-
niques. We do it all — except for being pregnant, giving birth, and 
breastfeeding. As for the rest of it, there’s nothing we can’t tackle. 
If we dare say so, we can even do some things better than moms.
Dadhood: A good time to man up
All your life you’ve had just one person to take care of — ­yourself. 
You’ve made choices, taken risks, and shouldered the conse-
quences. But becoming a father is “the big stuff.” You have a 
­vulnerable, dependent, helpless child on your hands who needs 
you for the most basic aspects of her survival, such as food, 
warmth, and love.

18      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Becoming a dad can add a profound sense of meaning to your life. 
Your views on life, priorities in the world, and aspirations for your 
own future are forever altered. This is a good thing. By becoming 
a dad you become part of the circle of life that has been going 
for eons. You’re passing on the baton to your child, packed with 
all your wisdom and skills, to send him off on his own journey. 
You’ve got so much you can share with your offspring.
Children need dads. A Canadian study showed that having a father 
in a child’s life helps her develop empathy. Another long-term 
study showed that a father’s involvement with his child from 
birth to adolescence helps build emotional stability, curiosity, and 
self-esteem.
If you’re going to have a child, be involved, committed, and pas-
sionate about your new role. Your child deserves nothing less.
Joining the movement
By becoming a father, you join the ranks of men for thousands of 
generations before you. You’ve come from a long line of fathers! 
So you’re in good company. In the United States, the average age 
of first-time dads is 32.
So as a soon-to-be-dad, we’d like to encourage and inspire you 
to join the movement of involved and active fathers. Our children 
need involved fathers in their lives, and you also owe it to your-
self. If you’re going to be a dad, be a 100 percent dad and experi-
ence it all. You wouldn’t do other things in your life halfheartedly, 
so get with it and give it your best shot. Make an effort, learn what 
you need to know, and spend as much time as possible with your 
child.
Exploring care routine strategies
The question of how best to raise a baby is one of the most hotly 
contested subjects today. The rows of parenting psychology books 
on bookstore shelves attest to that. We’ve become disengaged 
over the last few centuries from listening to our instincts. We’ve 
let medical science overrule our hearts and minds, and slavishly 
followed rigid routines and overbearing doctor’s orders that have 

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      19
demanded that mother’s convenience come first and baby’s needs 
come second. We’ve joined the rat race and let work dictate our 
daily and weekly schedules.
Families are also smaller than they used to be, so children can 
grow up never having to help mom wash the diapers or settle a 
baby like they did back in our grandparents’ day, when there were 
as many children in a family as you could find names for.
In recent years, there’s been a swing back to letting the child’s 
needs lead the way as well as research that backs up this method 
of parenting. Parents caught in the middle of grandparents’ ways, 
their own instincts, and the swing back to gentler parenting meth-
ods can find deciding on a parenting method confusing. Media 
reports shower us with research that says everything under the 
sun is bad for our kids, and we’re stuck between experts who pro-
mote their particular technique and the latest trend from celebrity 
parents. Chapter 10 has lots of great tips for raising your child in 
a warm, loving relationship, as well as making discipline work.
Keep in mind that the way you want to run things in your family 
is up to you. Whether you adhere to a strict routine or are a bit 
more laid back about it, your little one will be okay as long as he is 
clean, fed, and thriving; is happy and cheerful; gets enough sleep; 
and is shown love and affection. Don’t get caught in a trap of 
constantly comparing your baby to other babies; it generally leads 
nowhere and just adds to your frustration. Have confidence in the 
way you bring up your children and trust in your child developing 
in his own unique way.
These are some of the care routine strategies you may have heard of 
as you contemplate fatherhood and how you’ll cope with a newborn:
»
» Strict routine: In our moms’ day, a strict routine with 
feedings and sleeping by the clock was promoted as being 
the best way to bring up a baby. Today, advocates of this 
method claim that having a strict routine or schedule 
establishes good habits early so you can detour sleepless 
nights and excessive crying. For some parents, this routine 
works just fine, and their baby easily slips into line. For 
others, their baby resists and parents end up even more 
stressed out that their little one won’t play by the book.

20      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» A routine, but not by the clock: Babies need to feed and 
sleep at regular intervals, but rather than let the clock 
determine when that might be, reading your child’s cues is 
the key to making the routine work. There’s a pattern or 
routine of waking for a feeding, having a diaper change, 
spending some play or awake time, and then going back 
down for a sleep that continues throughout the day, but at 
night there’s no play or awake time. Chapter 6 has more 
about establishing a routine.
»
» Attachment parenting: This form of parenting mimics 
parenting styles found in developing countries, where cribs, 
bassinets, and strollers are rare. Your child is in contact with 
you at all times of the day, is carried around in a sling or 
baby carrier, and sleeps with you at night, so that she builds 
a strong bond and attachment with you.
Many other strategies for raising a newborn exist. Do you leave 
him to cry when you put him down in order to teach him to fall 
asleep on his own, or rock him to sleep in your arms for every 
nap? Do you have the baby sleep in your bed, or put him in a bas-
sinet in his own room? These are questions that you and your 
partner have to ponder and come up with your own answers to. 
You have to live with whichever strategy you come up with, so the 
strategy has to work for you. Chapter 6 gives you lots of ideas for 
raising a newborn.
Another minefield you’re going to have to get your head around is 
your child’s education. Private, public, parochial, Montessori — 
these are all terms you’re going to hear bandied about as your 
child gets older. Luckily for you, we’ve done some of the leg-
work in Chapter 15 so you can figure out the educational maze for 
yourself.
As your baby turns into a toddler, you’ll have to start thinking 
about discipline. People often think of discipline as the way you 
punish your child for being naughty. But in our books, that’s not 
what discipline is about. Discipline is about creating an envi-
ronment where your child can learn to adjust her behavior and 
understand what’s okay and what’s not. Discipline is about clear 
boundaries, consistency, and consequences. We talk about disci-
pline in more depth in Part 3.

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      21
The Seven Habits of Highly 
Successful Dads
Here’s a collection of seven habits we observe in amazing dads — 
a collection of traits that each and every guy can develop on his 
journey to becoming a father:
»
» Confidence: It takes time to feel truly confident about 
handling a newborn, but you gain confidence by doing things 
and getting your hands dirty (literally in some cases), even if 
at first things don’t go right. Looking after a newborn, baby, 
or toddler can seem daunting at times but isn’t actually that 
hard. It just comes down to being attentive to the needs of 
your little one, making an effort, and learning a few tricks.
No matter how hard things get — you’re stressed out at work 
and the baby’s waking up every three hours at night, your 
partner’s sick, and you’re doing all the housework — you’ll get 
through it and you’ll be a more confident dad (and person)  
as a result. So don’t be afraid to wade in because it will give 
you a great sense of achievement, lift your spirits, and build 
your self-esteem when you don’t have to rely on mom for 
anything to do with the baby (other than breastfeeding).
»
» Creativity: Sometimes you truly have to think outside the 
box when you’re looking after babies or spending time with 
children. Children have no trouble with pretend play and let 
their fantasies run wild, so just go with it. Sometimes you’ll 
also have to find creative solutions to some basic problems, 
such as when you’ve run out of diapers. An old dish towel 
may have to do while you take baby to the store to get 
disposables.
»
» Endurance: Sometimes the only way to cope with a situation 
is to endure it. When your baby is colicky and wakes every 
few hours at night, or is teething and cries constantly, you 
may be at the end of your rope trying to work out how to put 
a stop to that noise. Often there’s no solution; there’s nothing 
you can fix or do to make a difference. It’s just the way it is, 
and you’re going to have to suck it up. But understanding 
that everything in parenting comes and goes — that one day, 

22      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
your little one will sleep through the night, one day, your 
child will have all his teeth, and one day, he will grow out of 
colic — will help you endure the bad times while they last.
Like patience, endurance can be hard to muster when you’re 
tired, you’ve had little sleep, and you see no end in sight. The 
early weeks of a baby’s life are a little like an endurance 
sport — just surviving the sleep deprivation, the crying that 
grips your brain and shakes it about, and the never-ending 
rounds of feeding, burping, changing, and settling can seem 
impossible. But even marathons end sooner or later, so take 
every day as it comes and before you know it you’ll be 
celebrating your little one’s first birthday.
If you’re having a hard time coping with a crying child and 
feel like lashing out — stop right now. Put your baby in a safe 
place, such as her crib, and take a breather. Count to ten. 
Even better, go outside for a minute or two, take some deep 
breaths, and calm down. When you go back, comfort your 
baby and call your healthcare provider or someone who can 
come and take over for a while, while you take a break.
»
» Optimism: Your life as a dad will be much easier if you try to 
see the funny side of things and take the “glass is half full” 
position. At times you may be overwhelmed, stressed, or 
totally exhausted, and then it’s easy to slip into thinking 
nature’s way of organizing procreation totally sucks. When 
you get annoyed and you’re feeling negative, your child is 
likely to pick up on it, and he might actively participate in 
making the situation even more difficult to handle. So shake 
yourself up and snap out of negativity. Try a different 
approach or do something to get in a better frame of mind. 
Chances are you’ll get a more positive response from your 
child if you’re more positive.
»
» Passion: Immerse yourself in all the tasks that need doing 
around your baby, toddler, or child. By doing that, you’ll 
develop a passion for being a dad, and you’ll love being a 
dad with all your heart. Your child picks up on your passion 
and will be inspired to learn, develop, and grow with you at 
an amazing pace. In Chapter 7 you find more information 
about your baby’s amazing brain, how babies develop, and 
how you can help their development as a dad.

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      23
»
» Patience: Patience is a virtue — especially for dads! Patience 
is your friend and makes things a lot easier when you’ve got 
kids around. Without patience, you would just pop with 
anger and there’d be tears all around, even for you. Most of 
the learning in the early years (and perhaps even throughout 
life) is achieved through constant and frequent repetition. As 
a father, you’re in the business of facilitating that learning, 
which means repeating yourself a lot, such as reading Where 
the Wild Things Are for the 53rd time, or telling your toddler 
not to pour his milk in the fish tank for the 17th time. As 
adults we’re often not great at dealing with constant 
repetition because it’s deemed boring or frustrating. By 
fostering your own patience, you’ll be able to elegantly deal 
with constant repetition and keep your calm. As a result your 
child will get the support and encouragement he needs to 
learn. By being patient you avoid putting unnecessary 
pressure on your child to achieve something, which helps 
reduce frustration or feelings of inadequacy on his part.
»
» Presence: Taking time to be with your child and partner in a 
family is important. How you spend that time with your 
family is also important. Children have a finely tuned 
awareness of your attention. They can tell right away 
whether you’re actually engaging with them or merely 
present physically, with your mind miles away. Being present 
means you devote 100 percent of your attention to your 
child and you focus on what he’s doing. You don’t watch TV, 
read the newspaper, or get a bit of work done at the same 
time as playing with your child. If you’re hanging out with 
your child, be fully present and in the moment. For those 
dads who don’t live with their children anymore, hanging out 
with your kids isn’t as easy as it used to be, so we’ve included 
some info in Chapter 19 about spending as much time with 
your kids as possible. Also check out Chapter 9 for ideas on 
playing with your child.
Help, I’m a Dad!
We wrote this book because we were once new dads like you, 
starting out with mysterious new babies, wondering which way 

24      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
the diaper went on. Being a dad is a scary, wonderful, adrenalin 
ride of a trip and one many of you will judge your lives on. But at 
first it’s hard to know where to turn and who to ask along the way.
Asking for directions
Okay, we know, men don’t like asking for directions. That said, it 
helps to have a map or some cool navigation gadget. In some cases 
you may need specialist information, which is impossible to cover 
in a general book or website, so we’ve compiled a list of resources 
(see Appendix A) and general tips for finding information.
Finding trusted organizations  
and sources of information
The people who know your baby best are you and your partner. 
You know what he likes and dislikes, what his little quirks are, 
and when something doesn’t seem right with him.
It can be tempting to want to “fix” a particular problem a child 
has. Perhaps your baby is a bad sleeper during the day, or is col-
icky, or just won’t take a bottle no matter how much you try. As 
adults we’re used to having quick fixes and instant solutions for 
many problems in our day-to-day lives. For better or worse, with 
babies and children it’s different. Many aspects of babyhood and 
childhood can’t just be fixed. Things take time, perseverance, and 
a laid-back attitude. To overcome a particular issue, you may have 
to try lots of different approaches until you find one that fits.
So where do you find these different approaches? Your first stop 
should be your healthcare provider. She has experience with all 
kinds of children and can spend some time with your little one 
getting to know him and finding out what’s going on. Another 
good place for information is the booklet that you may have been 
given by the hospital or your baby’s pediatrician when your baby 
was born. These booklets often have good strategies for things 
like starting to feed your baby solid food, coping with crying, and 
dealing with diaper rash, along with local services you can call in 
times of need. This book too has invaluable information on these 
topics.

CHAPTER 1  Fatherhood      25
See Appendix A for more organizations you can get in touch with 
should the need arise.
Internet research
The Internet’s a pretty handy thing. With just a few keystrokes, 
you can search for anything your heart desires. But beware — 
anyone can build a web page, run a blog, or comment in a forum, 
but that person may not have the expertise you’re looking for. 
Gauge the quality of the information provided on websites by 
checking the organization or individual who’s responsible for it, 
their credentials, their affiliation with recognized authorities, and 
any ulterior motives they may have, such as financial, political, or 
religious reasons.
On the other hand, checking out forums where other dads are 
sharing their problems and offering solutions can be handy. Just 
don’t take as gospel that everything they say is authoritative. 
Remember that what works for one baby may not work for yours 
and vice versa.
As a starting point you can always check the site of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org) for useful and trustwor-
thy information. This national organization of pediatricians has 
­articles and information on every aspect of parenting.
If your baby or child is sick, avoid diagnosing her by searching 
the Internet. A real healthcare provider is your first port of call 
should you be concerned about your baby’s health. For more about 
­common health problems, check out Chapter 14.
Turning to friends, colleagues,  
and family
When you’re a new father, everyone in the world is excited for you 
and gets a bit nostalgic for when their own children were little. 
They’ll want to share with you their hard-won pieces of advice 
and have an opinion on just about every aspect of looking after 
junior. Some of it will make sense to you; other gems will seem 
bizarre. Just add each pearl of wisdom to your pile of approaches 

26      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
to try should you need to. Ultimately you’ll find out yourself 
whether or not something makes sense for your situation.
Turning to people who are close to you is an invaluable way to 
stay sane. If you’re struggling, go hang out with a dad who’s been 
through the wars himself. Looking at dads who’ve been through 
the crazy first weeks and months and then come out on the other 
side and want to have more kids is a great way to get inspired and 
motivated for your own journey. You may at first think they’ve 
lost their minds, but really, these dads are no different from you. 
They’ve survived, and as many dads say, “Every day just gets bet-
ter.” And no, they haven’t joined some terrible cult and become 
brainwashed — they’ve just had children, and one way or another, 
that tends to have a big impact on everyone.
Not long from now it will be you sitting down with a new dad, 
hearing tips and advice flow forth from your own mouth!
Starting your own group
We all know a new dad or someone who’s about to enter into the 
realm of fatherhood. Lots of dads meet at prenatal classes and 
keep in touch after that. Getting together to talk and share your 
experiences doesn’t need to be a formal affair, with chairs in a 
circle and “feelings.” It can be a beer while baby snoozes in his 
stroller or a coffee at a cafe with the little ones clamoring over 
each other on the floor. Getting together can be just a gathering 
at the park or watching a football game. Finding new dads to join 
you should be easy, but if you’re feeling a bit isolated, peruse local 
bulletin boards or the Internet for local dad groups. See ­Chapter 16 
for great networking ideas.
Another easy way to get together with other dads is to use the 
mom networks. Ask your partner about speaking to other moms 
about a dad get-together. Before you know it, a barbecue, picnic, 
or stroller walk will have been magically arranged, and you can 
take it from there.

Conceiving — the fun part
Understanding what can go wrong
Celebrating that you’re going to be  
a dad!
Getting Pregnant
D
eciding to start a family with your partner is one of the 
biggest decisions you’ll make in your life (yes, even bigger 
than buying a house or determining which football team 
deserves your undying support). Of course, getting pregnant isn’t 
always a conscious decision — sometimes it just happens. Other 
times, just getting to the starting line of fatherhood is a journey 
through the not-so-magical world of fertility treatments and 
embarrassing conversations about sperm counts.
No matter how you get to the pregnancy starting line, there are 
still nine months to get through before you earn your dad wings. 
How you get there isn’t as important as making a decision to 
approach the journey to parenthood together. Starting a family 
goes beyond just getting pregnant.
In this chapter you find out all about the adventurous and treach-
erous journey your sperm has to make before reaching his lady- 
in-waiting, the egg, and the equally risky mission the fertilized 
egg undergoes to get into its safe haven, the uterus. You find out 
tips and tricks to getting pregnant, and what options are out there 
if things just aren’t coming together. And finally, once things are 
underway, we guide you through the process of getting ready for 
the coming months.

28      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Here Comes the Fun Part
You’ve probably worked out where babies come from by now. 
Making babies is fun — we admit it — and so it should be! There 
aren’t many projects in life that start with a little time in the sack 
with your best girl. The rest of the journey may be exhausting, 
challenging, or even frustrating at times, but at least this one first 
step can be all about a good time.
So go on, have sex, and lots of it. There aren’t many manuals that 
tell you to do that, are there?
Conceiving naturally
Of course, in an ideal world, just making the decision to “start 
trying” would result in an instant pregnancy. But nature didn’t 
make it that easy. No sirree. There are lots of barriers between 
your sperm and her egg; in fact, it’s a miracle any of us were born 
at all.
Of the millions of sperm a man ejaculates during sex, only 
about 100,000 make it past his partner’s cervix at the entrance 
to the uterus, having run the gauntlet of acidic vaginal secre-
tions ­(Figure 2-1 shows the female reproductive system). Of the 
100,000 sperm that get past the cervix, only a measly 200 make it 
into one of the two fallopian tubes where a ready-to-be fertilized 
egg is waiting for a date — if your timing is right and your partner 
is ovulating (producing an egg). Luckily, there are many sperm to 
start with because such a small percentage of them survive the 
journey. In the end it’s a merciless race to see which one of your 
sperm emerges as the champion and fertilizes the egg by break-
ing into it.
Once the egg is fertilized, it moves down the fallopian tube and 
into the uterus or womb. Cell division starts, and before you know 
it (literally), the tiny cluster of cells begins nestling into the lining 
of the uterus wall, also known as the endometrium (see Figure 2-2). 
The cluster of cells then starts another long journey transform-
ing into an embryo, and after eight weeks gestation, into a fetus. 
Bingo — your baby is on his way.

Tipping the odds in your favor
Like a lot of things, getting pregnant is a matter of having quality 
equipment and good timing. Nail those, and your chances of get-
ting pregnant are pretty good.

30      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
But you can help things along by
»
» Being fighting fit: It goes for prospective fathers as well as 
mothers that the healthier you are, the better for concep-
tion. Now’s a good time to stop smoking, lay off the booze 
and other recreational drugs, get into an exercise routine, 
and eat well. It can’t hurt to do those things anyway.
»
» Letting gravity help: Try to keep your partner lying 
down — propping her hips up with a pillow to help gravity 
even more — rather than getting up and heading for the 
bathroom right after sex. Help those precious sperm get to 
their destination by keeping your partner horizontal with her 
pelvis tilted upward. So cuddle up or do whatever it takes to 
keep her in the bed! Remember — every little bit helps.
»
» Making a date: Ovulation is when an egg is produced ready 
for fertilization. It occurs on approximately day 14 of a 28-day 
menstrual cycle, with day one being the first day of your 
partner’s period. So plan for that time to be your “business 
time.” If your partner’s cycle is irregular or you just need more 
reassurance, try an ovulation test kit to tell you whether the 
time is right for romance. Ovulation test kits — sold over the 
counter at pharmacies and large chain stores — are urine tests 
that detect hormones, like pregnancy test kits. Look for them 
near the pregnancy test kits in the family planning section.
»
» Making sure your little fellows are in tiptop shape: Have 
a health check. Your doctor can check for any signs of 
sexually transmitted disease, any anatomical problems such 
as an undescended testicle, and any other issues you may 
not be aware of.
»
» Checking the safety of any medication you take: 
Prescribed medication as well as over-the-counter drugs can 
have a negative effect on you as well as mom or baby, so 
check with your doctor before taking anything during the 
baby-making process — and beyond.
»
» Practicing: Have sex at least once a day when your partner 
is ovulating. If you feel a little put off by scheduled sexy time, 
just have sex at least every other day — even in the off 

CHAPTER 2  Getting Pregnant      31
season. You never know what might happen. Being “in 
the mood” for sex has also been shown to help conception! 
Finally, do some research on positions that aid conception 
and try them out — now that’s an assignment you will  
enjoy!
Stress can affect your partner’s ovulation, so try not to get too 
worked up about not getting pregnant right away. Good things 
take time, and worrying about it won’t make things happen any 
faster! Wanting to get pregnant is a great excuse for having lots 
of sex, so just enjoy it for a while. If your partner is age 35 or 
younger, the average time until conception after you begin try-
ing is six months. Yes, that seems like an eternity when making a 
baby is foremost in your minds!
Your healthcare provider will probably advise your partner to take 
folic acid if you tell him you are trying for a baby. Taking folic 
acid won’t improve your chances of getting pregnant, but it will 
improve your chances of conceiving a healthy baby. See Chapter 3 
for more information about the effects of taking folic acid on your 
unborn baby.
Conception’s not happening
You’ve been trying for months. And trying. And trying. But con-
ception’s just not happening. You’re getting sick of sex — as if 
you ever thought that would be a problem. But yep, you may be 
feeling exactly like sex is the last thing you’d like to do. As they 
say, too much of a good thing. . . . So don’t beat yourself up over 
feeling sex-tired. Guess what — your partner may be having the 
same feelings.
Couples under 35 years of age who have been having regular 
unprotected sex for a year and haven’t become pregnant are said 
to be infertile, and those over 35 years old are deemed infertile 
after six months. If this is you, it may be time to talk to your doc-
tor about getting some help.

32      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Understanding What  
Can Go Wrong
Approximately one in six couples has an issue with getting 
­pregnant. There are a lot of factors in both partners that can cause 
infertility, but let’s just look at what factors could be affecting 
you for the moment. Problems on the male front — yes, it’s pos-
sible that your boys can’t swim — can account for 40 percent of 
­“infertile” couples not being able to get pregnant. Low sperm 
counts, blockages to the sperm being ejaculated, poor sperm 
motility (which means the direction they move — going around 
in circles doesn’t help make a baby), and sperm with an abnormal 
shape account for most fertility problems among guys.
Working out why conception 
hasn’t happened
The following factors can contribute to infertility in men:
»
» Anatomical problems such as erectile dysfunction or 
blockage caused by a varicose vein, called a varicocele, that 
connects to the testicle
»
» Exposure to harmful substances and heavy metals
»
» Lifestyle, such as smoking and drug taking, which can slow 
sperm
»
» Overheated sperm caused by taking frequent hot baths or 
wearing tight-fitting underwear or tight trousers (even jeans 
have been blamed for this)
»
» Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and 
chlamydia
In 40 percent of cases of male infertility, the cause may not be 
known. Either way, going for a checkup is a good thing to do. So 
be a man and own up to this task — if there’s a problem, at least 
you’ll know, and chances are you can do something about it. This 
reduces stress overall, and your partner will definitely love you 
even more for having a checkup.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Pregnant      33
If the issue is not with you, but your partner, try to be aware that 
this can be a rather rough time for her and she’s probably feeling 
like a bit of a failure. A lot of women believe that being able to 
carry and nurture a child is an essential part of being a woman, 
and not being able to do this may leave her feeling inadequate. 
As her partner you’re in the best position to help her feel just as 
whole a woman no matter what.
Exploring other ways  
to get pregnant
If your partner is having trouble getting pregnant, the first step 
is to talk to your doctor. In some cases, lifestyle factors may be 
holding you back, and if the problem is a blockage, surgery could 
help. But in other cases, it may be time to consider assisted repro-
ductive technologies and working with a fertility specialist.
These are some of the treatments you may want to talk about with 
your doctor or specialist:
»
» Intrauterine insemination (IUI): Semen is collected, given a 
bit of a cleanup, and then inserted into your partner’s vagina, 
uterus, or fallopian tubes. And yes, there may be a plastic 
cup and some dirty magazines involved — but hey, it’s all for 
a good cause! For example, this treatment is available for 
sperm with poor motility, meaning they can’t get to the egg 
on their own and need a little help.
»
» In vitro fertilization (IVF): Also known as making a “test 
tube” baby. Your partner is given hormone treatments to 
kick-start her ovulation. When she is ovulating, your partner 
goes through a procedure where her eggs are harvested. 
The collected eggs are then mixed with your sperm and 
given a chance to be fertilized. The fertilized eggs are then 
put into your partner’s uterus; then you wait to see whether 
they implant into the uterine wall.
»
» Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): Sounds sexy, 
doesn’t it? Rather than mix sperm and egg and wait to see 
which eggs are fertilized, sperm is injected straight into the 
egg. As with IVF, the fertilized eggs are placed into your 
partner’s uterus, where hopefully one implants.

34      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
About two-thirds of couples dealing with infertility do have a baby 
through medical intervention, so medical intervention is defi-
nitely worth finding out about. Ask questions, even if it can feel 
a bit embarrassing at the start. By the way, this is good training 
for going through birth — many more embarrassing moments to 
come!
OMG, You’re Going  
to Be a Dad
Partner’s boobs sore? Check. Period missed? Check. Thrown up 
for no reason? Check. That could mean you’re going to be a dad 
(either that or your partner just had a really stressful week). Either 
way — don’t panic. If your partner is really pregnant, you’ve got 
around nine months to sort out your new life. Say goodbye to the 
way you currently live — farewell to the days of tidy living rooms, 
sleeping in, and endless hours of self-indulgence — and say hello 
to fatherhood! So with that in mind, it’s really a good thing a baby 
takes around 40 weeks to grow from a tiny cluster of cells into a 
living, breathing, crying baby so you can get a few things in order, 
like confirming the pregnancy and figuring out the next steps.
ASSISTED CONCEPTION
If you use IVF or other assisted reproductive technology, be aware of 
the increased chance of multiple births. According to a recent report in 
the UK, on average one in four IVF treatments results in multiple preg-
nancies compared with one in 80 naturally conceived pregnancies.
With IVF, sometimes two embryos are placed into the uterus, increas-
ing the chances of having twins. If your partner is under age 35 and has 
no uterine abnormalities, some clinics may limit you to putting back no 
more than two embryos at a time. This is because the chance of com-
plications during pregnancy and birth, such as premature birth or pre-
eclampsia, is higher with multiple pregnancies than with a single baby.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Pregnant      35
Getting confirmation
Your partner has no doubt raced off to the nearest pharmacy on 
the first suspicion of being pregnant. Over-the-counter preg-
nancy tests can sometimes give inaccurate results, although 
they’re more likely to give a false negative result than a false pos-
itive result. Testing the first morning urine can improve accuracy. 
Even if you have a positive result from a test, the first thing you 
want to do is make sure the pregnancy thing is actually happening.
Make an appointment with a family doctor or obstetrician, who 
will test your partner’s urine for the hormone human chorionic 
gonadotropin (HCG) — that’s the hormone responsible for the 
morning sickness and bone-crunching tiredness your other half 
has to look forward to. If the test shows increased levels of HCG 
(that is, a positive result), your doctor may perform a gyneco-
logical examination on your partner to check the physical signs 
of pregnancy more closely. In some cases, her doctor may draw a 
blood sample to determine the exact amount of HCG in the blood.
But even your healthcare provider is only able to provide a definite 
answer when the pregnancy symptoms are clear, which is around 
four weeks after fertilization. So it might be a good idea to hold 
off telling the world — in fact, you may want to wait until the first 
ultrasound scan anyway. Find out more about ultrasound scans 
and breaking the news to others in Chapter 3.
Once you have confirmation of your pregnancy, a quiet (or loud) 
celebration with your partner is in order. However, it will have to 
be a celebration unlike most you’ve had in the past because alco-
hol, cigarettes, and other drugs are definitely off the menu. But 
hey — you’ll find plenty of other ways to have a good time!
Knowing what to do next
Welcome to the exciting new world of prenatal, or pre-birth, care. 
This was once strictly the domain of the pregnant woman and her 
doctor (usually male for some reason), but things have changed. 
For starters you as the dad are going to be much more involved 
(say yes!). But you also have more choices about who you team up 
with for the journey to parenthood. Your partner’s healthcare pro-
vider can refer her to pregnancy healthcare providers in your area.

36      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
The role of your healthcare provider of choice is to guide you 
through the pregnancy, birth, and early weeks of your baby’s 
life. She monitors the baby’s growth and well-being, and checks 
for conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes (see 
Appendix  B for help with terms used in pregnancy). She also 
works with you to come up with a birth plan, if you want to create 
one (see Chapter 3 for more details on birth plans), delivers your 
beautiful new baby, and helps you in the first few days after birth. 
This may include getting your partner started with breastfeeding 
or helping with basic baby care tasks such as bathing or changing 
a diaper. In general, your lead maternity provider is your go-to 
person if you have any questions regarding health issues, or just 
need someone to talk to during the pregnancy. So check with her 
first before contacting other services or professionals.
Yes, a lot of attention during this time will be on the mom-to-be. 
But that doesn’t mean you can’t ask questions and have a say in 
the kind of care your partner and unborn child receive. You, as dad, 
have a very important role in the making of your family, so don’t 
feel embarrassed or afraid to ask about anything you’re not sure of.
Choosing a healthcare provider
You’ll find a maze out there of midwives, birthing centers, obste-
tricians, and hospitals. Knowing who does what can help you 
decide where you would like your baby to be born and what kind of 
care you would like to receive during and immediately after birth.
»
» Family healthcare providers include medical doctors as 
well as physician assistants and nurse-practitioners. Medical 
doctors may specialize in family medicine or general medical 
care, called internal medicine. They aren’t specialists in 
prenatal care or childbirth, but in rural settings, they may 
provide maternity care. Both nurse-practitioners who 
specialize in family medicine and physician assistants are 
often employed by and work with family medical doctors.
»
» Certified nurse-midwives are trained health professionals 
who give prenatal care, deliver babies, help establish 
breastfeeding, and follow up for about four to six weeks 
after the birth to help when you’re unsure about your baby’s 
health and well-being. Lay midwives may have experience 

CHAPTER 2  Getting Pregnant      37
but no formal training in childbirth. Midwives take a holistic 
approach to pregnancy and birth, and often counsel you as a 
family, acknowledging not just the physical challenges of 
becoming new parents, but also your mental and social 
well-being. They see pregnancy and birth as a natural 
process, not a medical one.
While they are trained in their field, they are not doctors and 
do not perform cesarean sections. If you choose to go with a 
midwife and complications arise during the pregnancy or 
birth, she will most likely arrange for you to see an obstetri-
cian. Certified nurse-midwives generally assist with hospital 
or birthing center births, while lay midwives or licensed 
midwives may do home births. Lay midwives are not legally 
allowed to assist with home birth in many states. In some 
states, it’s illegal to plan a home birth.
»
» Obstetricians are doctors who specialize in obstetrics, or the 
health of women and babies during pregnancy, birth, and 
after the birth, called the postpartum or postnatal period. 
They generally work in hospitals; few medical doctors in the 
United States participate in home births.
During the birth, midwives or hospital nurses are on hand 
throughout labor to monitor your baby’s progress. 
Obstetricians see their patients during labor as often as 
needed — more if your partner is high risk — and are 
present throughout the delivery itself. Obstetricians are 
primarily concerned with the physical health of the baby and 
mother, and generally don’t assist with any nonmedical 
baby-care issues after birth, such as teaching you how to give 
your baby a bath. They won’t come to your house to show 
you how to best change your little one’s diaper, either. For 
help with general baby care, friends and family or a good 
prenatal class can be the biggest help. Lactation consultants 
offer excellent support for breastfeeding issues. Your doctor 
can recommend sources in your area.
Talk with whoever you choose as your maternity healthcare pro-
vider about the options for where your baby can be born: at home, 
in a hospital, or in a birthing center. The availability of birthing 
options depends on where you live and the provider you have.

38      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Take time to find the right maternity healthcare provider for you. 
Your family doctor may make recommendations; friends and family 
may have suggestions based on their own experiences as well. Make 
sure you’re really happy with your healthcare provider and that 
you have “good chemistry.” Things can get pretty hectic during 
pregnancy or birth, so make sure you’re in good hands and you’re 
comfortable with your provider’s personal and professional style. 
If you’re not happy, consider changing. Both of you should be 100 
percent comfortable with your choice of healthcare provider, but in 
reality, what’s most important is that your partner likes her; she’ll 
be seeing way more of her (and vice versa) than you probably will.
Things to do before morning  
sickness starts
Your life is about to change forever, so there’s no time like the 
present to do some of those things you may have to trade in when 
your child is born.
Here are a few things we suggest for celebrating your impending 
fatherhood while you still have the time:
»
» Get in loads of unprotected sex (with your partner!).
»
» Take the vacation of your lifetime. Vacationing won’t be the 
same for the next 18 years or so — make the most of it now.
»
» Ponder your own experience growing up and the things you 
would like your child to experience.
»
» Sleep in late, cook a leisurely brunch for you and your 
partner, or go for picnics.
»
» Splurge on something indulgent, like going to a fancy 
restaurant or a day spa.
»
» Start a journal, scrapbook, or blog to document the months 
leading up to your child’s birth and make it a memento to 
give your child when she’s older (yes — plenty of good 
material for an embarrassing 21st birthday slideshow).
»
» Read up on massage and practice on your partner. Invest in 
a few good quality aromatherapy oils and some sweet 
almond oil. (Hopefully, she’ll return the favor!)

CHAPTER 2  Getting Pregnant      39
ADOPTING
You’ve been having sex on schedule for years now and had the tests 
to make sure your little guys are not only plentiful but frisky as well. 
Your partner has been through multiple cycles of IVF but it just hasn’t 
worked out, and all the trauma of not getting pregnant is way past its 
use-by date. Perhaps you have decided to give up on having a biologi-
cal child of your own.
Being unable to conceive a child doesn’t have to mean you can’t be a 
father. Adoption is another option you can look at.
Adopting a child means you take on the parental rights and responsi-
bilities of looking after that child as you would if you were his biologi-
cal father. That’s a lifetime’s responsibility. It can be easy to love your 
own child unconditionally, and you have to decide whether you’re 
able to do that for a child who’s not biologically yours. Many adop-
tions these days are open adoptions, which means the child and his 
birth parents stay in touch with each other. Lawyers who specialize in 
adoption, private agencies, and the child welfare system are all poten-
tial sources to assist with adoption and matching parents with a child.
The number of babies who are put up for adoption in the United 
States and other first-world countries is much lower than it was a gen-
eration ago. Some couples look at adopting a child from overseas. 
Americans adopt more children from China than from any other 
country, but many children are also adopted from Eastern European 
nations such as Ukraine, as well as from countries such as Haiti.
Whether you go the home-grown route or travel overseas, the adop-
tion process is a lengthy and often expensive one — there are police 
and background checks, information evenings to attend, and visits to 
your home from social workers. Once you have jumped through all 
the official hoops, your profile may be put into a pool waiting to be 
selected by birth parents. This can take up to a year or more.

Preparing for birth
Pregnancy: 
A Drama in 
Three Acts
P
regnancy is a bit like The Lord of the Rings trilogy: It has a 
beginning where the scene is set and there’s a bit of chaos, 
a middle where things calm down a bit, and an end where 
everything comes to a head. The three distinct parts are called 
trimesters, and each has its scary and great bits (just like in the 
films), such as the first time you hear your baby’s heartbeat at a 
checkup, feel your baby kick inside mom’s belly, or see your 
baby’s body twisting and turning on an ultrasound screen.
The easiest part of becoming a dad is the pregnancy bit. ­Fortunately, 
dudes don’t get the morning sickness and leg cramps, and aren’t 
the ones who can’t get out of bed without a crane. By the end 
of the pregnancy, you’re probably going to be a bit over hearing 
about what aches this week or what ridiculous food your part-
ner has to have right now. But that’s not to say there’s nothing 

42      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
for dads to do during pregnancy. Apart from all the preparations 
(which we talk about in Chapter 4), there’s all the stuff you can 
do with your partner to help her out a bit and to get to know your 
offspring (yes — before he’s even born!). Your partner definitely 
needs a strong man for the finale, the birth of your baby (which 
we cover in detail in Chapter 5).
In this chapter we take you through the three trimesters and show 
you what your baby is up to on the inside. We also take the mys-
tery out of morning sickness and explain why your partner can’t 
sleep even though she’s exhausted.
Act One: The First Trimester
After the initial excitement that you’re going to be a dad, the hard 
work of supporting your partner through pregnancy begins. Of 
course, supporting your partner’s not actually that hard, until you 
have to demonstrate your commitment to your new role when the 
initial ultrasound scan clashes with an all-important meeting you 
had arranged for that day.
Eating for two — or how to gain  
30 pounds in 40 weeks
During pregnancy your partner is literally “making the baby” (in 
an assembly line kind of way), so good ingredients are essential for 
a quality end product, meaning that your unborn baby needs good 
food. Mom’s healthy diet during pregnancy has a profound impact 
on the well-being of your little one even later in life, so encour-
age your partner to eat well. For you, this may mean ­laying off 
unhealthy options as well — there’s nothing worse than tempting 
a pregnant woman with food she can’t or shouldn’t have.
Your partner also needs good food to help her deal with the physi-
cal, mental, and emotional changes and challenges she faces until 
your baby is born. The female body requires 10–12 percent more 
energy when pregnant.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      43
So, what is “good food”? Your partner needs:
»
» Six servings of fruit and vegetables: An apple or tomato is 
a serving; so is half a cup of salad. Leafy green vegetables are 
particularly good as they contain folic acid, which helps 
prevent birth defects such as spina bifida (see Chapter 18 for 
more about birth defects).
»
» Six servings of grains: A cup of cooked pasta or rice, or a 
slice of wholegrain bread or a bread roll makes a serving. 
Whole grains are particularly useful because — you guessed 
it — they contain folic acid.
»
» Three servings of dairy: A large glass of milk, a tub of 
yogurt, or two slices of cheese are each a serving. Low-fat 
milk helps control weight gain.
»
» Two servings of protein: An egg, two slices of lean red 
meat, or two chicken drumsticks are one serving. 
Vegetarians can also get protein from nuts and seeds, 
legumes, and tofu.
Folic acid, also called folate, is a B vitamin that is important to 
help prevent birth defects like spina bifida. Eating folate-rich 
foods such as whole grains, chickpeas, and leafy green vegeta-
bles helps your partner reach the recommended daily allowance 
of 400 micrograms. Most pregnancy healthcare providers recom-
mend upping your partner’s folic acid intake by using vitamin 
supplements, even before she gets pregnant. Check the recom-
mended amount of folic acid, as some women in a high-risk cat-
egory need more, and follow your health provider’s instructions.
Pregnant women shouldn’t eat certain foods because of the risk of 
bacteria, such as listeria, to which pregnant women and unborn 
babies are extremely vulnerable. So don’t go treating your sweetie 
to the following:
»
» Any cooked food that has been in the fridge for more than 
12 hours
»
» Cold deli meats or pâté
»
» Ready-made salads

44      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» Soft cheeses like brie, ricotta, and blue vein
»
» Sprouted seeds
»
» Sushi
»
» Unpasteurized milk
Ask your primary care provider, obstetrician, or midwife for a 
comprehensive list of foods to avoid.
By the end of her pregnancy your partner may be really itching to 
eat a good bit of brie or sushi again, so a great way to celebrate 
the baby’s birth may be to put together a platter of the things your 
partner’s been missing out on for nine months. Start a “foods to 
remember after birth” list.
Understanding the medical stuff
During the next nine months you’re going to learn a whole new 
vocabulary and get to know your partner’s insides more than you 
may want to. Appendix B lists terms to help you decipher what 
your care provider of choice is talking about.
If you’re unsure of where the various parts of the female repro-
ductive system are located, see Chapter 2.
Dealing with common side effects 
in the first trimester
For some unfortunate moms, the first three months of pregnancy 
are a downright drag and can feel like an illness rather than the 
beautiful, natural process of creating life. There’s no glow, and 
there’s no bump to show off. Instead, as your baby makes itself 
comfy in your partner’s uterus, he’s making his presence known 
in other ways. Symptoms vary wildly from woman to woman, 
so there’s no way of knowing exactly what’s going to hit your 
­partner. Here’s a list of common complaints.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      45
Morning sickness
Morning sickness typically involves feeling nauseous and, in some 
cases, vomiting. It’s a common condition usually experienced 
during the first three months of pregnancy. Morning sickness 
doesn’t pose a risk to the baby unless it’s very severe. Morning 
sickness is caused by those crazy pregnancy hormones and usu-
ally subsides after 12 weeks. It can come on anytime but is usually 
worse in the morning because your partner’s stomach is empty. 
At its worst, morning sickness is like having a hangover and being 
seasick at the same time, so no wonder your partner is off to the 
bathroom once again. Get used to it — bathrooms also become a 
prominent feature in the last trimester, albeit for different rea-
sons (your partner needs to pee every ten minutes because the 
baby puts pressure on her bladder).
One thing that makes morning sickness worse is getting up on an 
empty stomach, so try having a plate of dry crackers or toast with 
a little jelly or peanut butter ready for your partner to nibble when 
she first wakes up. Other tips include eating smaller portions more 
often during the day, increasing intake of carbohydrates and reduc-
ing intake of fats, and stimulating pressure points on the inner arm 
just above the wrist crease, which supposedly reduces nausea.
Morning sickness can get so bad that your partner may become 
dehydrated. The symptoms aren’t always easy to spot, so double-
check with your midwife, obstetrician, or primary care provider  
if your partner is having a really rough time with morning sick-
ness. She may prescribe medications to help reduce nausea, in 
severe cases.
Exhaustion
Your baby’s growing rapidly and taking a lot of your partner’s 
energy. Getting through a day at work may be more than your 
partner’s up to, so you can score lots of points if you take on more 
of the household chores, prepare meals, and do the things your 
partner’s not up to doing.
Sensitivity to smells
Pregnancy does strange things to a woman, not least of all her 
ability to smell everything. Your partner can walk into a room you 

46      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
left three hours ago and smell your aftershave. She’s sensitive to 
most smells, especially things like perfume, food, and gasoline 
fumes — they may even make her vomit — so if you’re heating 
up your favorite garlic bread (the one with extra garlic and blue 
cheese), open a window or put on the exhaust fan.
Tender breasts
You’ve probably heard of the following concept: “You can look, 
but you can’t touch.” For many expectant dads, the same concept 
now applies to their partner’s breasts. Pregnancy hormones cause 
your partner’s breasts to become a bit bigger, but they’ll be sore 
and tender. So while you may be admiring your partner’s new 
shapely form, it may pay to wait until she invites you to party 
before gate-crashing her bra.
Moodiness
Blame it on the hormones, because your partner hasn’t turned 
into a grumpy, unpredictable monster; she’s just at the mercy of 
her body. Go easy on her if she’s a little off kilter right now. Talk 
to your partner and figure out a way to communicate when she’s 
in one of her moods, because progesterone, the hormone respon-
sible for all this, isn’t going to go away for a long time yet.
ACTIVITIES TO AVOID
Some activities are not recommended for moms-to-be, such as:
•	 Going on rides in theme parks (because of the acceleration the 
body experiences during the ride)
•	 Extreme sports and adventure sports (such as bungee jumping, 
parachuting, and wild water rafting)
•	 Dyeing her hair (because of the chemicals used in dyes)
•	 Traveling on a plane (in case the baby decides to arrive early, 
although this is mostly relevant toward the end of the pregnancy)
For a comprehensive list of things to avoid, ask your healthcare 
­provider.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      47
Though your partner’s feeling yucky, this is your chance to shine. 
You can treat your partner and make her feel special in lots of 
simple ways at this difficult stage. Come home with a little gift 
(baby socks are great), give her a pregnancy massage (along with 
some nice oils to battle stretch marks), or get a good DVD for the 
night. If your partner bites your head off for trying, don’t take it 
personally. Try again next week.
What’s your baby up to?
Between 6 and 12 weeks, your baby grows from around one-­quarter 
of an inch long to around 2 inches in length (see Figure  3-1).  
In other words, your baby has grown about 800 percent in 
six weeks. No wonder your partner is so tired.
Illustration by Kathryn Born, MA
FIGURE 3-1: At 12 weeks, your baby is about the size of your little finger.

48      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
During this time, your baby’s organs take shape, with the heart 
beating from about six weeks. Though neither you nor your part-
ner can feel it yet, your little tadpole (they look like that at the 
beginning) is moving around in there. She’s floating in amniotic 
fluid in her amniotic sac. The placenta is developing to act as life 
support for your baby.
TWO (OR MORE) FOR THE  
PRICE OF ONE
You’ve just found out, through the magic of an ultrasound scan, that 
you’re going to be a father of not one, but two babies at once. You’re 
freaking out. Being dad to two at the same time is hard work, but of 
course not unmanageable. Being dad to two at the same time is a 
great opportunity to be twice the man (at least) that you are today!
Having twins, triplets, or more babies at once is called a multiple birth. 
Multiple births happen in two ways. Identical or monozygotic twins are 
formed when the fertilized egg divides into two very early on, and two 
separate embryos develop. Non-identical twins, also known as frater-
nal or dizygotic twins, occur when two eggs are fertilized at once in the 
fallopian tubes. Triplets can sometimes be a combination with two 
identical twins and a fraternal twin, but not always.
In pregnancy, twins are more at risk of arriving prematurely (38 weeks 
for twins is considered full term) and having a low birth weight. Your 
healthcare provider will guide you through the intricacies of multiple 
birth and will probably monitor your partner’s well-being throughout 
the pregnancy more carefully.
Unfortunately, it often means that the side effects of being pregnant 
are more pronounced, so morning sickness may be more intense; 
weight gain faster and earlier in the pregnancy; and things like vari-
cose veins, heartburn, and shortness of breath more pronounced. 
Find out more about common side effects for the last two trimesters 
later in this chapter. Also see Chapter 2 for more info about IVF and 
multiple births.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      49
Between 6 and 12 weeks, your healthcare provider may do an ini-
tial ultrasound scan. The first ultrasound is a pretty big deal for 
most parents-to-be. You get to see your baby for the first time — 
granted, you may not initially be able to determine what’s what 
until your health provider points it out — but it’s something you’ll 
never forget. Unfortunately, early ultrasounds can also pinpoint 
problems with the pregnancy. This happens in about one in six 
cases; if something’s wrong, your partner may have a spontane-
ous miscarriage or need to terminate the pregnancy for medical 
reasons. Your healthcare provider typically mentions this before 
the scan, but talking about this scenario with your partner before 
you have your first scan is a good idea.
Act Two: The Second Trimester
The morning sickness is waning, your partner is feeling a little less 
exhausted, and she’s beginning to show a bit of a baby bump — 
welcome to the second trimester. Weeks 13–28 are usually the best 
period of pregnancy. You start to see your partner’s body change as 
the baby grows and feel the baby’s first kicks by putting your hand 
on her belly — a pretty amazing feeling.
Because 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks, 
many parents don’t announce they’re pregnant until the second 
trimester.
Now is also the time to ask about a nuchal fold test to check for 
potential birth defects, especially if your partner is age 35 or older. 
A nuchal fold test aims to determine the likelihood of your baby 
being born with Down Syndrome.
Enjoying the golden trimester
Most pregnant women feel a lot better throughout the second 
trimester. As your partner’s belly is getting bigger, the reality 
that you’re going to have a child really sets in. Exciting times! 
Sometime in the second trimester, your partner probably also 
starts feeling those first kicks and bumps. Typically this happens 
around 18–20 weeks. They may be hard to spot at first, as that 

50      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
little foot tries to get in touch with you through all those abdomi-
nal muscles, but feeling those kicks for the first time is a pretty 
magical moment.
You see your partner transform as the baby grows, and she may 
start planning what to buy (not more clothes!) and how to deco-
rate the baby’s room. This is called “the nesting instinct,” and 
you pretty much have to go with it. When it comes to purchasing 
things for the baby, however, dads are hugely important as they 
tend to “keep it real.” Many household budgets are under a lot of 
pressure when the baby arrives, and with your partner being high 
on hormones, you should go shopping together to avoid a local 
financial crisis. See Chapter 4 for an overview of what you actu-
ally need to buy.
Around 20 weeks, your midwife, obstetrician, or family doc-
tor may send you for an ultrasound scan to make sure that the 
baby’s development is on track and that things are progressing 
smoothly. If you can’t wait another 20 weeks to find out your 
baby’s flavor, you can usually find out at this scan, unless junior 
has his legs crossed!
Sex during pregnancy is absolutely okay in most cases (ask your 
doctor) and apparently is even good for the baby as well. Bonus! 
The second trimester may be the best time to share a bit of pas-
sion, although it depends greatly on how your partner is feeling 
throughout pregnancy. By the way, it’s not out of the question to 
have sex almost up until labor, depending on how your partner 
feels. Couples have been known to use sex to bring on labor (see 
Chapter 5 for more about bringing on labor).
Understanding more medical stuff
Your caregiver will start to feel for the baby at each checkup by 
asking your partner to lie down. He also uses a Doppler or a fetal 
heartbeat monitor to listen for the baby’s heartbeat, which at a 
remarkable 120–160 beats per minute, sounds like a dance party’s 
going on in there. Your caregiver also checks the fundal height, or 
the length of the uterus as it progresses into the abdomen.
Your midwife, obstetrician, or primary care provider also routinely 
asks your partner for a urine sample to check for protein in her 

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      51
urine. Blood pressure gets the once-over too, as high blood pres-
sure and protein in the urine are both indicators of preeclampsia.
Dealing with common side effects 
in the second trimester
Most changes during this trimester are a result of the growing 
size of your baby. They include
»
» Back pain: This is perhaps one of the most common com-
plaints of pregnant women and is caused by the growing 
weight of the baby, additional strain on the spine, and a change 
in the center of gravity that the body needs to adjust for.
»
» Constipation: This is a common problem during pregnancy. 
The main reason for constipation in the second trimester is 
an increase in the hormone progesterone, which slows the 
movement of food through the digestive tract. Later in 
pregnancy the problem of constipation is likely to be made 
worse by the pressure of the growing uterus on the intes-
tines. Taking iron supplements, which many pregnant 
women take, can also make constipation worse.
»
» Heartburn: This burning sensation in the middle chest is 
caused by the hormone progesterone, which softens the 
uterus so it can stretch, but also softens the esophagus, 
allowing acid to come back out. So if your partner complains 
about heartburn, don’t be offended — your cooking isn’t the 
cause.
»
» Leg cramps: These seem to plague pregnant women more 
at night, but no one’s sure what causes them. Blame the 
hormones, we reckon.
»
» Softening ligaments: The ligaments in the pelvis stretch, 
which widens the pelvis to prepare for birth. It can give your 
partner a floating sensation in the joints and cause sharp 
stabbing pains when she stands up too quickly or rolls over 
in bed. This is called round ligament pain and is nothing to be 
worried about, although knowing about this pain is good.
You can’t do much about these things, other than continue to be a 
superstar with your support, love, and encouragement.

52      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
What’s your baby up to now?
At 24 weeks, your baby is nearly 12 inches long (see Figure 3-2). 
She also has her calendar full doing these amazing things:
»
» Getting her eyes done: Pigmentation in the iris (the colored 
portion of the eye) develops. If your baby is of European 
descent, she’ll be born with blue eyes that may change color 
in the months after birth. African American, Native American, 
and Asian babies can be born with brown or blue eyes, and 
eye color can also change with time.
Illustration by Kathryn Born, MA
FIGURE 3-2: At 24 weeks, your baby is about the length from your 
elbow to your wrist.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      53
»
» Having a facial: Your baby’s using the world’s best moistur-
izer, vernix, a waxy coating that keeps her skin from getting 
wrinkled as she floats around in fluid all day. She’s also 
growing fingernails, hair, and eyebrows.
»
» Listening to music and your voice: Your baby can hear 
now, but won’t know what she’s hearing for a long time yet, 
though research suggests that babies know their parents’ 
voices when they’re born from what they hear in the womb. 
Amazing, isn’t it?
»
» Preparing to rock and roll: At the end of the second 
trimester, your baby is almost done growing and developing 
all external and internal organs.
Act Three: The Third Trimester
You’re on the final lap now. Don’t get too excited though; you still 
have some hoops to jump through. Start thinking about child-
birth education classes, which your care provider can refer you 
to. These classes can be extremely valuable in terms of educat-
ing you about the process of birth, can answer any burning ques-
tions you might have, and can allow you to meet other prospective 
dads who are just as excited — or terrified — as you are. Lots of 
people go on to keep in touch with their classmates as their babies 
grow. Your hospital probably offers these classes for expectant 
parents. If you’re interested in a certain birthing method, such as 
the Bradley method or Lamaze, you may find classes that discuss 
these birthing types.
Checking with someone who has already attended a prenatal class 
you are interested in is definitely a good idea. Some classes are 
more dad-inclusive than others. For example, some providers 
split the group into moms and dads to talk about specific issues or 
situations. Having a guys-only session as part of a prenatal class 
is great, as it provides the ideal opportunity for some “man talk” 
about pregnancy, babies, and fatherhood.

54      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Making choices about the birth
The time’s come to start looking forward to The Birth. That 
baby is going to have to come out. In ye olden days, birth was a 
straightforward thing — woman goes into labor, sheets are torn 
into strips, water is boiled, there’s a lot of yelling, and then baby 
comes out. These days, with technology and greater awareness of 
the anatomy of birth, you’re faced with a lot of choices concern-
ing how junior enters the world. Home birth or hospital birth? No 
drugs, or all the drugs you can get? With lots of family, a video 
camera, and updates on Twitter? Or just your partner, the person 
delivering the baby, and you?
First up to think about — and possibly foremost in your partner’s 
mind right now — are pain relief options. There’s a swing toward 
having as little intervention or being as natural and drug-free 
as possible during labor and birth. But ultimately the pain relief 
options really depend on your partner’s preferences. Toward the 
end of pregnancy, she’s probably grappling with the idea of what 
labor is going to be like and the pressure to be as stoic about it as 
possible. Supporting your partner and standing by whatever deci-
sions she makes regarding her body and the birth of your baby 
goes a long way toward making it easier on her.
Here’s a look at what’s on the menu:
»
» Drug-free: Heat packs, massage, breathing exercises, and 
being in water may help relieve the pain of labor. Keeping 
active during the birth and avoiding lying on her back can 
also help your partner manage the pain.
»
» Epidural: An epidural is a local anesthetic injected into the 
spinal column. It blocks out all pain and is often used during 
cesareans so the mother can be awake when her child is 
born. Around 60 percent of American women have epidural 
anesthesia in labor.
»
» Narcotics: Intravenous pain relievers, including narcotics 
and sedatives, can cause drowsiness in both mother and 
baby, though usually without any long-term effects. Most 
healthcare providers won’t give them if they think your 
partner is close to delivery, because they can depress the 
baby’s breathing. They can also cause nausea.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      55
Another big decision is where and how to have the baby. No doubt 
your partner has researched all options by now. Unfortunately the 
“I just want to wake up in the morning and my baby will be here” 
option doesn’t exist. She’s probably let you know what her next 
best option is — or you may ask her about it. The most common 
scenarios are
»
» Birth centers or free-standing birth centers: Having your 
baby in a special birth center run by midwives may provide 
you with additional options to try particular birthing tech-
niques or varying positions during labor. However, birth 
centers generally take a non-interventionist approach and 
don’t provide epidurals. And if you need a cesarean section 
or your baby requires special care, you’ll need to be trans-
ferred to a hospital.
»
» Home birth: This option has become more popular but is 
still the exception in the United States. Less than 2 percent of 
American women give birth at home. For a home birth, you 
need the support of a midwife, usually a certified or lay 
midwife, if your state regulations allow, because most 
nurse-midwives deliver in hospitals or birthing centers. If 
your partner wants a water birth, you can rent special 
equipment to facilitate the birth at home.
»
» Hospital birth: Most women in the United States opt for a 
hospital birth. Some hospitals provide extra facilities for 
water births or natural (as in no pain relief) births.
Talk with your care provider about your options and discuss the 
pros and cons of each one. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and 
be sure you know everything you need to be confident about the 
upcoming birth. As your partner’s number-one support person, 
you need to know what’s going on just as much as she does.
Your health insurance may dictate your choice of healthcare 
­providers or even which hospital you use. Check out your policy at 
the beginning of pregnancy to avoid unwelcome surprises later.

56      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Understanding even more  
medical stuff
As you head into the home stretch of pregnancy, you have more 
checkups with your midwife or obstetrician, and you and your 
partner work out a birth plan. This sounds like an oxymoron, as 
birth is one process that you just have to surrender to — you have 
very little control over what happens. Lots of pain relief options 
and delivery methods are available, so be clear with your mid-
wife or obstetrician about which of these you’re interested in and 
which you’re not. That’s what a birth plan is — a clear under-
standing of how you would like things to go so that the person 
delivering your baby knows your wishes.
Keep an open mind about how the birth will go. If you’ve planned 
for a nice water birth at home, be prepared that if things don’t 
go as smoothly as you would like, you may have to be transferred 
to the hospital. Or if you’ve said there’s absolutely no way your 
woman needs pain relief, she may be yelling for an epidural in the 
first five minutes. The ultimate aim is delivering your baby safely 
into the world with the least amount of anxiety and trauma on 
your beloved so you set off on your parenting path on the healthi-
est and safest foot.
Your healthcare provider checks the baby’s position and makes 
sure she’s in the right place. During this trimester your baby 
makes her way down headfirst toward the cervix, ready for birth, 
a process called engaging. If she has her feet pointed down toward 
the cervix, she’s in a breech position. If she stays breech until the 
birth, chances are your care provider will recommend a cesarean 
birth.
Your caregiver may also take swabs from your partner’s vagina to 
test for group B strep, which is a bacteria that can infect your baby 
as she’s being born. This is often done during the second half of 
pregnancy. If traces of it are discovered, your partner will prob-
ably need to be on an antibiotic drip during labor.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      57
Dealing with common side effects 
in the third trimester
By now the golden glow of the second trimester is getting a bit 
tarnished. As your partner nears her due date, your baby is start-
ing to take over her body — literally. Her internal organs are 
getting pushed and shoved all over the place and her abdomi-
nal muscles have split in the middle to make way for that wide 
load she’s carrying. Your partner may even waddle already, as her 
relaxed ligaments widen her pelvis.
Some common complaints during this time include the following:
»
» “I’ve got baby brain.” Pregnant women often feel like 
they’re losing their marbles. They tend to forget stuff, don’t 
remember simple or frequent activities, and appear to be 
running around like headless chickens. These symptoms are 
believed to be caused by hormones, lack of sleep, and the 
general toll pregnancy takes on the body.
»
» “I can’t sleep but I’m so tired all the time.” Insomnia is one 
thing most mothers-to-be in the third trimester agree on. 
Her joints may be sore, back aching, with a baby that kicks all 
night and heartburn to boot. Your partner may also need to 
get up to hit the john every five minutes. Lying on her back to 
sleep can put pressure on the vena cava, an important artery 
feeding the heart, so she has to lie on her side at night, and 
turning over in bed can be a little trying. You can suggest she 
try a pillow under her right side, where the vena cava is, 
which tilts the weight of her body off the artery.
»
» “I’ve got varicose veins, and worse — hemorrhoids.” The 
third trimester can be hard on a girl. She’s getting rounder by 
the day and may waddle; she’s tired, and not getting enough 
sleep is making her grumpy. And then hemorrhoids turn up 
and make her feel downright miserable. She’s not feeling like 
a radiant mother-to-be anymore; she’s feeling like a veiny, fat 
frump. Varicose veins and piles can be caused or made 
worse by the weight of the baby on her body, so get her to 
take it easy and rest a lot.

58      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» “My ankles are swollen and I’m big as a house.” As well as 
carrying a rapidly growing baby around, your partner’s 
retaining fluid and has more blood flowing through her 
body. In hot weather or after standing for long periods, this 
blood collects in her ankles. Your partner should put her feet 
up whenever she can and avoid salty foods. A few foot rubs 
from dad wouldn’t be out of line either. Calling her “fatso” or 
“chubby” does not go down well, even if you think she looks 
hilarious.
»
» “Why doesn’t anything I eat taste right?” Blame that 
pesky progesterone — along with everything else, it causes 
food cravings. Finding anything that tastes just how she 
wants it to be may be very hard for your partner, and 
predicting what she needs is almost impossible. We suggest 
that you roll with it and keep up your partner’s spirits by 
suggesting lots of different options.
Taking slow walks together, reading or singing to the baby in bed 
at night, making lists of potential names together, and taking 
photos of that burgeoning belly make for a good time and help 
you support each other as the big day approaches. These are some 
of the last days that your family numbers just the two of you, so 
take time to be with your partner right now.
Preparing for Project Push — are 
we there yet?
Yes, almost! Your baby’s just putting on the finishing touches 
before making his glorious entry into the world. He’s been keep-
ing busy by
»
» Beefing up: At the start of the third trimester, your baby 
weighed around 2 pounds, but by the end, he has reached his 
birth weight — between 7.5 and 8 pounds, on average. The 
most rapid weight gain — half a pound per week — happens 
in the final few weeks.

CHAPTER 3  Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts      59
»
» Getting in position for take-off: In most cases your baby is 
head down with his feet under your partner’s rib cage (see 
Figures 3-3 and 3-4). No wonder she’s uncomfortable. If your 
baby is butt down, he’s breech, which could necessitate a 
cesarean section. But babies can and do turn into the vertex, 
or head-down position, any time in pregnancy. After 36 
weeks, it becomes less likely, due to the cramped space.
»
» Practicing for life on the outside: Your baby is taking 
practice breaths and — somewhat less endearing — urinating 
into the amniotic fluid. His eyes are open, and you may see 
him holding the umbilical cord or sucking his thumb on 
ultrasound.

Preparing for 
a Baby in the 
House
F
ew things change the way you live as much as welcoming a 
baby into your life. Having a baby is like having a house guest 
who never cleans up after himself, cries a lot, and has more 
needs than the two of you put together. Adding a baby to the fam-
ily is not as simple as clearing out the spare room for him to sleep 
in. He needs stuff: clothes, bedding, diapers, all sorts of things you 
need to think about that become part of your daily life as a father.
As you count down to your baby’s birth, you need to get things 
done to avoid hassles down the line — get those bags packed and 
ready for the hospital, get the bassinet and a car seat sorted, and 
be ready to go at a moment’s notice. When he arrives, chances 
are you won’t have a lot of time for decorating the baby’s room 
or shopping for socks, so it’s best to get those things out of the 
way now.

62      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
In this chapter you discover the ins and outs of what to look for 
when buying things like nursery furniture, strollers, diapers, 
clothes, and toys. You find out what diaper rash is and how to 
prevent it, and how to help your baby when he’s teething. We give 
you lots of checklists for everything you need to do before the 
birth and what you need to take with you to the hospital or have 
prepared for a home birth.
Getting the Right Gear
Who would have thought a baby would need so much stuff? ­Getting 
set up for a new person in your house takes a bit of thought — and 
a mountain of cash if you’re not careful. Rather than expecting 
you to go out and buy every bit of gear the baby shops say you 
must have, we tell you what you really need.
To keep costs down, send the word around among your co-workers 
and friends that you’re having a baby. They may have cribs, bassi-
nets, car seats, and strollers they’re no longer using. You can com-
pletely outfit a nursery for very little or even for free if you have 
generous friends and relatives.
Baby needs new shoes . . .  
and a whole lot more
Baby clothes come in more shapes and styles than you would have 
thought possible. Babies don’t dress like miniature adults. They 
hate itchy materials, fussy buttons, and other things you might 
put up with to be fashionable. However, because adults and not 
babies buy clothes, you’ll find a whole spectrum of adorable stuff 
specifically designed to appeal to adults, covered with duckies and 
little toy cars.
Distinguishing types of baby clothes
Be forewarned: It’s hard to resist this stuff, especially for moms- 
to-be. But check out what works for you before you break the bank 
on Prince George–inspired smocked rompers or other outfits that 
really don’t fit your lifestyle.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      63
»
» Bodysuits are long- or short-sleeved T-shirts that also cover 
the baby’s diaper area and snap at the bottom for easy 
changing. They are handy for keeping everything tucked in 
so that baby’s tummy doesn’t get chilly, and they also keep 
him looking pulled together. They’re great during the 
summer months when a short-sleeved bodysuit can be worn 
by itself without pants or as pajamas.
»
» Footies are all-in-one outfits that either snap or zip up the 
legs and front. They’re like bodysuits with leg coverings and 
socks. Some snap up the back, which is really inconvenient, 
and we recommend steering clear of them. Most have feet, 
but you can get some without feet (called “nonfooties” or 
“coveralls”) for summer. Most also have long sleeves.
»
» Sleeping bags (also called gowns) are like footies with 
sleeves but no legs, just a sack covering your baby’s legs and 
feet. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents 
not to use blankets in cribs for infants up to one year, so 
having her wear a sleeping bag means she can’t get cold. 
Gowns that have elastic around the bottom are also good for 
late-night diaper changes, because if her legs are bare under 
the sack, you can get to her diaper more easily and disturb 
her less.
Listing the clothes that your 
baby needs from the get-go
The following list is a guide to what you should have ready to 
go for your newborn baby. You can customize your list as you 
find your dad-legs and figure out which items work well for you. 
You can also tweak the list to suit the seasons. As a general rule, 
baby clothes should be loose-fitting, made with breathable and 
soft fabric, not too tight at the neck, and easy to open and close. 
Remember, you can go through three to four sets of clothes in a 
day because of diaper leaks and baby spit-up. You need
»
» Lots of bodysuits. Count on at least six, but the more, the 
better.
»
» Four footies. As with bodysuits, the more, the better. These 
are popular baby shower gifts.

64      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» Four pairs of pants of some sort. Overalls are pretty cute, 
but make sure they have snaps in the legs so you don’t have 
to take the whole lot off to change her diaper. Elastic waists 
on pants are easier than fumbling around with zippers and 
snaps.
»
» Four sleeping bags for nighttime. Look for cotton material 
rather than polar fleece or microfleece, as those fabrics 
aren’t breathable, and she may get overheated.
»
» Two jackets for going out. Look for jackets that are easy to 
zip or snap; buttons take too long to do up.
»
» Two sweaters or wraparound jerseys. Choose the kinds 
that don’t need to go over her head. Most babies hate things 
put over their head.
»
» Lots of pairs of socks. Make them all the same if  
possible — one is always getting lost.
»
» Four hats. These are preferably made of a Lycra-cotton mix 
so they stretch, or lovely soft wool if they’re handmade. 
Some babies hate hats and pull them off; look for something 
that snaps or ties under the chin if your baby is one of them.
»
» Lots of bibs with either snaps or Velcro. Bibs with ties can 
be a pain to put on. Velcro stops sticking after a number of 
washings. Some large bibs go over the baby’s head.
»
» Two pairs of soft shoes. In our experience, shoes that have 
elastic around the heel stay on better than other slip-ons. 
Babies don’t need real shoes until they’re walking outside.
»
» Two pairs of gloves or mittens. Get some that clip to your 
baby’s outerwear because babies tend to lose them 
­(intentionally and unintentionally).
Trying tips for choosing baby clothes
Here are some tips for selecting clothes and getting your baby all 
dressed up:
»
» Most babies get grumpy at having clothes pulled over 
their heads. Avoid anything that doesn’t have a few snaps 

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      65
opening at the shoulder or an envelope-style neckband (two 
overlapping pieces of fabric that stretch easily when put 
over her head) to make pulling the clothing over her face 
painless.
»
» When putting on a sweater or any other top that doesn’t go 
over your baby’s head, it’s a good idea to lay it on the surface 
you’re dressing your baby on before you lay her down. Then 
all you have to do is slide her arms into the sleeves and snap 
her up, and you’re good to go.
»
» Avoid anything that has a back opening. Your baby spends a 
lot of time lying on her back in the early months, and it can’t 
be comfortable having snaps under you. They’re also tricky 
to get on when you’re getting her dressed.
»
» Avoid anything that looks like it’s going to be a pain to put 
on. Some babies really dislike getting dressed, and trying to 
tie silly little ribbons when she’s having a meltdown isn’t our 
idea of a good time.
»
» If your baby arrives in winter, look for clothes that have folds 
sewn into the ends of sleeves — they’re actually mittens. 
These are great to keep your baby from scratching herself 
with those needlelike newborn nails.
»
» If in doubt about sizing, buy clothes that are too big. At least 
you know junior will grow into them. Avoid the newborn or 
0–3 month sizes, unless your baby is tiny or a preemie. (The 
nearby sidebar has more information on sizing.)
»
» If you’ve been given a lot of hand-me-downs, be aware that 
the fire retardant in some clothing may be worn and will not 
be as effective as it is in new clothes.
»
» You will be given a ton of new clothing as presents, so if you 
find you have too much, don’t be afraid to take it back to the 
shop and swap it for something you can use in the future, 
like the next size up.
»
» Dark colors show baby spit-up much more than light colors, 
but light colors show baby poop much more! Just go with the 
colors you like.

66      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Handling a baby during the first few months can feel a bit tricky 
because she can appear really fragile. So think about what steps 
you need to go through to put on a particular item of clothing. If 
the clothes seem complicated to close or open, don’t buy them. 
Don’t be afraid to try out the garment in the shop with a baby doll. 
Borrow someone’s small child to take with you if you feel silly 
carrying a doll into the store, or better yet, borrow someone’s real 
baby if he’ll let you.
Shopping for shoes
Your baby won’t need shoes for a while yet. A good time to start 
looking for shoes is when your little champ starts crawling. Stud-
ies show that going barefoot is best — but that’s not always 
SIZING THINGS UP
Until he’s school age, figuring out what size your little one wears can 
be challenging, because babies grow and gain weight at different 
rates and, like adults, have different body types. Many 6-month-olds 
wear 12-month clothing; this doesn’t mean your daughter is going to 
grow up to be an NFL linebacker. Here are the basic categories:
•	 0–3 months: Birth to three months, or newborns under 8 pounds. 
Full-term babies outgrow this size very quickly.
•	 3–6 months: Manufacturers vary, so look at their weight charts. 
Some manufacturers also cut their clothing to be narrower than 
others. When in doubt, try it on (the baby, not you).
•	 6–9 months, 9–12 months, 12–18 months, 18–24 months: These 
sizes often have little relation to your child’s actual age. Go by the 
weights listed on the clothing label.
After two years, things get even more confusing. Some manufacturers 
continue to list ages in months, while others switch to years. Sizes 
listed in months are sometimes, but not always, more fully cut to 
accommodate diapers than clothing with sizes listed in years.
If your baby is premature, look for clothing made especially for pree-
mies. Some manufacturers also make clothing in newborn, or NB, 
sizes.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      67
practical. For a baby who isn’t walking yet, soft-soled shoes with 
elasticized heels work well and protect toes from being scraped on 
the floor or ground.
Here are some tips and tricks for buying your toddler’s first pair 
of shoes:
»
» Let your baby walk around in the shoe just like you would if 
you were trying on new shoes for yourself.
»
» Choose shoes with half a finger’s width of wiggle room at the 
front and end, but no more than that — he’ll trip over his 
own feet.
»
» Look for shoes that are as similar to bare-feet conditions as 
possible. He doesn’t need arch support at this stage!
»
» Babies’ feet get hotter and sweat more than adults’ feet do, 
so choose natural breathable materials rather than 
synthetics.
»
» Many cheap children’s shoes give out in the toes — toddlers 
are always crawling on the ground, and then they’re up on 
their feet, using their toes to leverage themselves. Make sure 
the shoes have extra-sturdy stitching in the toes for long 
wear.
»
» Soles that grip are important too, as junior needs all the help 
he can get to not slip when he’s learning to walk.
Filling the toy box
When your baby is born, all he does for a while is poop, pee, 
eat, cry, sleep, and gaze — often with an unfocused stare — at 
things. So he doesn’t need electronic gear, a racing car set, or a 
mini piano. What he needs are things that give him a real sense of 
the world he’s just come into — simple objects that provide new 
sights, shapes, textures, smells, sounds, and sensations.
These can easily be provided by spending time with your baby, 
singing to him, and touching his skin and fingers with textures 
like an old comb, fabric, your hair, leaves, the cat’s fur — you 
get the idea. As he begins to grasp and brings his hands together, 

68      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
things like a rattle or a chain of plastic rings can keep him fasci-
nated for ages.
When your baby starts teething, he looks for things to put in his 
mouth to push against his gums to relieve the discomfort. Many 
toys double as teething rings, even if they weren’t originally 
designed to be.
Some good ideas for baby toys include
»
» Cloth or hard cardboard books. Look for ones with flaps or 
things to touch sewn into them, so your baby can experience 
different textures. Reading to your child daily is one of the 
most important gifts you can give him.
»
» Plastic keys. For some reason babies love your car keys, so 
give them their own set. These are great for teething too. 
However, nearly every baby will still prefer your keys to his, 
so keep yours out of his reach.
»
» Play gyms. Play gyms are mats with arms curved over the 
top where you can attach colorful objects like soft toys or 
musical objects for your baby to look at as he lies on the 
mat. Just make sure he can’t pull down anything that he 
shouldn’t be chewing on. Nothing is safe from his gummy 
mouth once he’s got the hang of his hands.
»
» Rattles. You can buy rattles or make your own from old 
plastic containers filled with noisy objects. Ensure the lid is 
on securely and never leave your baby alone with an object 
that could come apart.
»
» Soft toy animals. One of these will probably become your 
baby’s most treasured friend, and it will never be the one 
you favor, so buy only stuffed animals you won’t mind seeing 
for the next six years. Avoid button eyes and other remov-
able parts that baby could choke on.
Less is more when it comes to toys — no matter what the toy 
manufacturers tell you, nothing beats spending time playing 
and exploring with your baby. Brain development is assisted by 
appropriate stimulation and human contact.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      69
To make sure toys are safe for your little one, check for any parts 
that may come off and become a choking hazard, as well as tox-
ins, such as toxic paints. Inevitably your little guy will try to put 
all toys (and most other things) into his mouth, so make sure 
they’re safe to put in his mouth. The following website provides 
guidelines on purchasing safe toys for your littler one: www.cpsc.
gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/Toys/.
Strollering in style
Strollers have evolved into high-tech, fold-at-the-touch-of-a-
button contraptions that can double as shopping carts, hold water 
bottles, be taken off-road, and cook you lunch (just kidding). 
Many strollers integrate with your baby’s first car seat, so you can 
transfer the whole seat into the stroller without removing him 
when he’s tiny.
Baby stores are packed with different models of strollers. A stroller 
is often one of the bigger purchases you make in this fatherhood 
game, so shop around.
Some research suggests that babies in strollers that face toward 
you rather than out into the world are better as your tyke is less 
stressed. Facing each other encourages more talking, laughing, 
and social interaction.
These are some of the things you need to look out for:
»
» Can you put a car seat or bassinet attachment on it in the 
early months, making it easier to transfer junior from bed or 
car seat?
»
» Does the stroller come with a fitted sunshade and fitted 
weather cover?
»
» Does the stroller fit through the door of your favorite stores? 
Can it be easily maneuvered through a packed supermarket? 
If you’re looking at three-wheeled strollers, make sure the 
front wheel isn’t fixed so you can maneuver it easily.
»
» How easy is it to adjust the back of the seat? Can your baby 
lie down flat in it for sleeping? Can the back be raised up high 
for a growing child to see more of the world around him?

70      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» How easily will the stroller fit in your car trunk — or in your 
house? Some models can be bulky.
»
» How easily does the stroller fold down? The last thing you 
want is to be pulling levers all over the place when you’ve got 
a fussy baby to deal with. If you’re traveling by bus, strollers 
that can be folded down with only one hand are ideal so you 
don’t have to hand your baby to a total stranger while you 
wrestle with getting the stroller onto the bus.
»
» How well does the stroller support your child’s growing spine 
and neck?
»
» How well will the stroller survive if you want to take it on 
unpaved walkways or paths?
The following website provides valuable safety information  
on strollers and buggies: www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-
Releases/2014/CPSC-Approves-New-Federal-Safety- 
Standard-for-Carriages-and-Strollers/.
Choosing the right car seat
Getting a cute mobile for your baby’s crib is optional, buying a 
stroller that you can take mountain running is optional — but 
using a car seat for your most precious cargo is not. Yeah, sure, you 
free-ranged in your parents’ car when you were little and lived to 
tell the tale, but sadly some children haven’t. So take advantage of 
the fact that things have evolved somewhat since those days and 
use a car seat for every journey you take in the car with your baby.
As with strollers (see the preceding section), so many models of car 
seats are out there that it pays to shop around. Luckily you’ve got 
a few months to do this! There are different sizes according to the 
age and weight of your child, generally falling into these categories:
»
» Infant car seat: This is a car seat specifically used for 
newborns up to approximately 20 pounds. The car seat fits 
into a base that stays in the car, which is strapped in using 
the car’s existing seatbelts. Infant car seats should only be 
used in a rear-facing position — the best position for 
children in a car for as long as you can keep them that way.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      71
An infant car seat can be taken out with your baby in it — leave 
the base in the car or you’ll look pretty silly — and attached to 
some strollers. They’re not meant to fit over a shopping cart, 
no matter how many people you see using them that 
way. Baby car seats also have a movable handle so you can 
carry your baby around in it like Red Riding Hood’s basket of 
goodies. However, the seat will constantly bump your legs, 
jarring the baby and bruising you. Putting it into a stroller is 
easier for both of you.
»
» Child car seat: Some car seats are convertible, meaning you 
can use them all the way up from newborn to your child’s 
21st birthday — or almost. An insert holds your baby in place 
when he’s tiny and is removed when he’s older. Car seats 
usually have straps that attach to bolts in the back of the 
back passenger seat or to the floor when in the rear-facing 
position. If your car doesn’t have bolts, they can be pur-
chased and put into the car by a mechanic for very little 
money.
»
» Booster seat: Every state has its own laws about when your 
child can sit in a booster and how long he needs to use one. 
Check the Governors Highway Safety Association website at 
http://ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/childsafety_
laws.html for a current list.
Infants should stay in rear-facing car seats until they are at least 
two years old. Rear-facing positioning reduces the risk of death or 
serious injury by up to 75 percent, according to a 2007 study. Kids 
with long legs are still better off riding rear facing.
Think twice about buying a secondhand seat. Seats sold in the 
United States have expiration dates printed somewhere on the 
seat. After this date, the plastic may start to weaken, provid-
ing less protection in an accident. Car seats that have been in an 
accident may also be damaged in places you can’t easily see and 
should not be used.
Add-ons like custom car-seat covers can be cute, but they’re 
not always safe. Don’t use anything aftermarket on the car seat, 
not even if the manufacturer says it’s designed to fit. Check this 
website for more information: www.safercar.gov/parents/ 
CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.

Feeding, bathing, and entertaining
You thought you were done shopping in the baby aisle? Oh no — 
there’s much more to fill up your house with. You find most of 
these things lurking in homes where kids live:
»
» Baby bath or tummy tub: You need something to wash 
your baby in. While the kitchen sink will work for a while — as 
long as you clean out the carrot peels first — he’ll eventually 
need something a bit larger, but not as large as the regular 
bathtub.
Changing tables that converted to infant baths used to be 
common, but many parents don’t have the room for them. If 
you do have one, it will save some wear and tear on your back. 
Otherwise, you’ll need something to set in the big bathtub, at 
least until your baby can sit up by himself. A bath support is a 
ramp that baby can lie back on that holds her at a 45-degree 
angle so her head is safely kept out of the water. There are 
many different styles and you — and your baby — may prefer 
one type to another, so shop around.
»
» Bouncy chair or infant seat: Most kids have spent time in a 
bouncy chair or infant seat, which is a baby chair that your 
baby can lie in to watch you go about your day from a better 
angle than lying on the floor. These seats are portable and 
easy to clean, and she can even sit outside in one while 
you’re gardening. Some have built-in vibrating mechanisms 
that calm a fussy baby, while others have activity trays that 
keep baby busy. These seats come with safety straps that 
should be used every time you put the baby in it.
»
» High chair: When your baby starts solids, you’re going to 
need somewhere she can sit to be fed. A wide range of 
high-chair models is available, from chairs with an ergonomic 
design made of wood that hasn’t been treated with chemicals 
to chairs with more levers and straps than a space shuttle. 
Having a detachable tray that you can take off and clean 
regularly (after every meal!) is essential, as are safety straps 
so you can be sure she isn’t going to wriggle her way out of it 
and get hurt. As an alternative to a high chair, you may want 
to use a model that attaches to your table. Later on you can 
use a little booster seat that you strap to a normal chair.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      73
»
» Swing: No, this isn’t the kind of swing you attach to the apple 
tree. This kind lives inside your house and takes up about 
half your living room. Baby swings can be lifesavers if you 
have a fussy baby because the constant movement soothes 
him, although watching it — and listening to it squeak and 
play the same horrific tune over and over — may drive you 
crazy.
Take a look at Chapter 8 for information about baby slings, front 
packs, and carriers.
Making Room for the Baby
When you were growing up, do you remember how important 
your bedroom was? It’s more than the place where a child’s bed is 
or where his clothes are stored. It’s a child’s sanctuary, his own 
special space that has all the things he loves close by. Although he 
won’t know this for a while yet, you can start creating that indi-
vidual, happy space for him before he’s born. But first we cover 
what every nursery needs to have.
Finding functional furniture  
and gear
Crib, bassinet, dresser, changing table, rocking chair, book-
shelves, toy boxes — the nursery is one place you can spend a 
whole bunch of money on all new stuff if you’re not careful.
Here are some of the basic items you need to set up a nursery.
Somewhere to sleep
For the first few months, most babies like to sleep in an enclosed 
space like a bassinet or other small area. Many parents use play 
yards, which are small playpens that often have a bassinet area 
that fits on the top, for the first few months.
A bassinet is like a basket on legs. If the bassinet is on wheels, 
you can move it from room to room easily during the day for naps 

74      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
(babies can sleep anywhere when they’re newborns) and wheel 
it into either your room or the nursery at night. When baby has 
outgrown the bassinet he can graduate to a crib, where he’ll sleep 
until he’s about two or has figured out how to climb out of it.
If you’re getting a secondhand crib or bassinet, check it thor-
oughly to make sure nothing could fall apart and injure your baby. 
Older cribs may not satisfy current safety regulations, which state 
that crib rails must be no more than 23⁄8 inches apart. You should 
not be able to fit more than two fingers between the mattress and 
crib side. Side rails that lower can also be dangerous for your baby.
To find out more about ensuring your baby’s safety when 
sleeping and reducing the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death 
­Syndrome) or SUDI (Sudden Unexplained Death of Infants), 
check out Chapter 17. Also check out the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission’s website, Safe to Sleep, at www.cpsc.gov/en/
Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/cribs/.
Somewhere to be changed  
and dressed
A lot of parents buy changing tables — tables at the right height 
so you don’t have to lean a lot to change baby’s diapers or get 
her dressed. Some experts advocate that babies should be changed 
on the floor to avoid having baby roll off a changing table, but 
others just stand by the rule that baby is never left on the table 
­unsupervised — even for a second. Whichever you choose, hav-
ing a changing mat or a load of cloth diapers to have under her to 
catch protein spills — pee, poop, or vomit — is essential.
Even if you’re going the disposable diaper route, we believe a few 
packages of cloth diapers are an essential accessory. They can act 
as changing mats, can be put over your shoulder to catch any baby 
spit-up when you’re burping her, can be used to protect the couch 
for a quick change, and are handy to clean up spills when you’re 
out and about. They’re inexpensive, washable, and very hardy, 
and every diaper bag should have one or more.
Somewhere to store clothes
You would think that a person so small wouldn’t need much room 
for her clothes, but she grows so big so fast that she needs room 

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      75
to store not only the clothes she currently fits into, but also the 
ones she grows into. Hand-me-downs and presents from well-
meaning friends and family mean clothes are rarely in short sup-
ply. Child-sized hangers for her wardrobe can be bought from a 
houseware or discount store.
If you’re given too many hand-me-down clothes, having a sys-
tem in place for sizing stops you from feeling overloaded. Have 
designated boxes for each size and store them in your baby’s 
closet or dresser. As she grows out of one size, you’ve got another 
size ready to go. This is a great job for you when your partner goes 
through a period where she can’t organize herself out of a paper 
bag because of all the hormones going crazy during pregnancy or 
after birth.
Odds and ends you can’t live without
Other things that are handy to have include the following:
»
» A diaper bucket with a tight-fitting lid for soaking soiled 
clothing, bedding, and cloth diapers.
»
» A clothes hamper or basket.
»
» A rocking chair or armchair where mom can breastfeed or 
you can give the last bottle of the day before bed. An 
armchair or rocking chair is also somewhere to share stories, 
songs, and cuddles as your baby gets bigger. Some moms 
find chairs without arms most comfortable, so try out a few 
options. Many come with an ottoman or recline.
»
» A pedal trash can with a lid — the big size if you’re using 
disposable diapers. Yes, the pedal is essential!
»
» Something to house toys and books, such as a bookshelf or 
toy box.
»
» Diaper cream or powder, wipes, and other toiletries in arm’s 
reach of where you change your baby. (Find out more about 
these in the later section “Crème de la crèmes.”)
»
» A lockable medicine box where you store health items like 
pain-relief medications, a thermometer, and nail clippers 
(see “Stocking up on health essentials” later in this chapter).

76      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Decorating the nursery
Decorating your baby’s room is another way to clean out your 
wallet in a hurry, as there are thousands of things to put in a 
little person’s room to add personality and style. Expectant moms 
have been known to get carried away, so you may have to display 
a bit of good old male shopping rationale. Babies spend a lot of 
time gazing into space when they’re really small, as if they’re 
tuning into a radio show you can’t hear, and like looking at high-­
contrast objects around them, such as black and white shapes. 
Keep the decorating simple. As your baby develops his taste and 
his needs change, transforming the nursery into a little child’s 
room won’t take a complete overhaul.
Here are our tips for keeping it simple:
»
» Keep the colors and designs neutral, so that the room can 
easily be redecorated as your baby grows. Teddy bear 
wallpaper may be cute when he’s a few months old, but not 
when he’s seven.
»
» Use pictures of close friends and family on the walls so your 
baby can grow up knowing who the important people are.
»
» You or your partner may want to make something special for 
the baby’s room, like a painting or piece of embroidery.
»
» Mobiles hanging from the ceiling don’t need to be fancy. A 
string of shells hanging from driftwood can entertain a small 
baby, but make sure anything you hang is extremely durable, 
so it doesn’t fall apart on the baby’s head. Also make sure 
the mobile is well out of baby’s reach because small pieces 
or hanging strings can be a choking or strangling hazard; 
remove the mobile when he’s able to get it to it.
»
» Use removable decals on the walls, so they can be easily 
taken off as baby grows up and out of the nursery themes. 
Choose things that won’t damage the wallpaper or paint.
»
» Involve your child in the decoration of his room as he gets 
older. After all, his room is his space.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      77
Keeping pets and babies  
safe from one another
A lot of couples have a cat or a dog before baby comes along. The 
change a little person brings affects the pet’s life as well as your 
own. Your pet will find itself a long way down the pecking order 
once your cherub is on the scene and will have to put up with 
pulled fur, loud noises, and being chased in the not-too-distant 
future.
Show your child how to be gentle with animals and people from 
the get-go, as well as how to approach dogs with caution. A child 
should always hold her hand out for a dog to smell and stay still 
when it comes near so the dog doesn’t see her as a threat.
Teach your child not to touch strange animals (almost impossible 
until she’s a bit older) and to wash her hands afterward as ani-
mals can carry all sorts of nasties in their fur.
Don’t leave your child alone or out of sight with pets. Cats can 
react badly when your baby decides it’s time to “ride the kitty” 
and may even give junior a scratch or two. If the mantra of being 
gentle to the cat doesn’t warn your child that felines are not to be 
messed with, then a scratch on the nose most certainly will.
Dogs and cats can feel neglected when a new baby joins the fam-
ily, so spend time making them feel settled and happy. Don’t 
move your pet’s special sleeping areas or toys away to make room 
for baby. Try to keep your pet’s routines as settled as possible so 
it doesn’t feel left out.
A great way to keep cats out of your baby’s crib is to fill it with 
balloons during the day. If your cat hasn’t encountered balloons 
yet, chances are it’ll go near them only until the first one bursts.
Filling the Changing Table
There’s a reason you see a whole aisle of the supermarket dedicated 
to baby stuff — there’s a lot of it, and there are a lot of things to 
choose from. Parents also make for really easy prey for marketing 

78      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
people. A few sleepless nights and sheer desperation do amazing 
things to your shopping habits. So taking a good look at all the stuff 
you can buy before the baby arrives makes the shopping-in-a- 
hurry experience easier on you later on. Don’t worry about buying 
the wrong diaper cream, teething gel, or diapers. You go through 
lots of them and have plenty of opportunities to try out different 
options. But we can help you get a head start.
Check out Chapter 12 for some great money-saving tips for home-
made versions of baby stuff.
The great diaper debate
As a guy, you probably don’t think about diapers much. Until you 
become a dad, that is. Get used to diapers; they will become a 
major part of your life, because they stand between you and a 
whole lot of pee and poop.
You can select from three main options when choosing what to 
wrap your baby’s bottom in: cloth diapers that can be washed and 
used over and over (a diaper service can provide these as well), 
disposable diapers that you throw away after each change, and 
hybrids where you throw away some parts and keep the main parts.
Of course, you can go diaper free and practice elimination commu-
nication if that’s your thing (see Chapter 6). This takes more com-
mitment than most dads have, but if you have a lot of free time, it 
can eliminate a lot of diapers!
Cloth diapers
Cloth diapers have come of age — again. No longer are cloth 
diapers those scratchy, leaky, bulky cloth things that require a 
degree in origami to fold into the right shape and hold together 
with safety pins. Now cloth diapers come already shaped like a 
baby’s actual bottom, and Velcro covers make putting them on 
and getting them off as easy as a disposable diaper.
Cloth diapers do require a bit more money upfront plus the time 
and energy to wash them, but some comparisons show that cloth 
diapers come out cheaper than disposables. Modern cloth diapers 
can also be used on more than one child and can be bought in good 

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      79
condition secondhand. Eco-conscious dads can rest assured your 
child’s diapers aren’t clogging up landfills for years to come.
Disposable diapers
If you think just changing diapers is gross, having to clean them 
may be a step too far for you. Disposable diapers mean you never 
have to clean a diaper. They can be a better option if you’re on 
vacation or for carrying in the day-to-day diaper bag so if your 
baby needs a change when you’re out and about, you don’t have 
to carry a dirty diaper around until you get home. Recently eco-
friendly dye-free, latex-free, chemical-free disposables have 
entered the market. They’re now available in most big box stores 
but may be pricier than the major brands. They’re typically made 
from cornstarch and other sustainable resources, and often don’t 
contain any of the chemicals that keep babies dry but which may 
cause diaper rash, as well as being bad for the environment.
Disposable diapers may be right for you if you live in an area 
where water is scarce. Cloth diapers use a lot of water in rinsing 
and washing.
Hybrid diapers
Hybrid diapers are made of a washable underpants part and a dis-
posable pad. Hybrid diapers generally require an upfront invest-
ment in the pants but tend to work out cheaper in the long run. 
They come in some pretty cute patterns that may have your part-
ner jonesing to buy some and can double as shorts in the summer.
Crème de la crèmes
Diaper rash is a big concern for most babies from time to time. 
Diaper rash occurs when the ammonia from baby’s stool and 
urine irritates his skin, making it red and tender, and making him 
pretty unhappy with life. The easiest way to stop diaper rash in its 
tracks is to expose the bottom to air and sunlight for a good half 
an hour a day. Changing his diaper regularly and using a barrier 
cream or powder can protect his bottom from a nasty rash too.
Like all things baby, you can find an enormous range of diaper 
creams on the market, and your partner might have a few ideas of 

80      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
what to get. Don’t feel overwhelmed by the vast choice of prod-
ucts available. At the end of the day, anything from the supermar-
ket that has zinc oxide in it will do the trick. You can also try using 
petroleum jelly as a barrier cream.
Manufacturers want you to buy all sorts of other creams to make 
your little champ smell good, have nice skin, relax, fall asleep bet-
ter, and so on. By all means, try them out, and if you find one that 
works really well, keep using it. In general we recommend keep-
ing it simple and using natural oils, which are cheap and effective. 
Olive, coconut, and almond oil have been known to be particularly 
effective for most temporary skin irritations and even cradle cap 
(see Chapter 7 for more about oils and cradle cap).
Stocking up on health essentials
Having an arsenal of potions and lotions on hand in the early 
months and years is essential. Here’s what we think every dad 
should have in his baby fix-it kit:
»
» Almond or coconut oil: Your baby doesn’t need moisturiz-
ers or scented lotions. If she has dry skin, pure oil is best 
without all the toxins and fillers big companies use to 
preserve their products. Cold-pressed, unrefined vegetable 
oils made for baby use are best — health food stores may be 
your best source for these.
»
» Antibacterial cream: Stop infections in cuts and grazes by 
treating them with antibacterial cream. Ask your healthcare 
provider for recommendations.
»
» Baby wipes and warmer: This may seem silly to you, but 
imagine having your butt wiped with a cold, wet piece of 
paper, and it might make more sense. Wipes makes cleanup 
easier, and warmers that warm the wipes makes your baby’s 
life more pleasant. Win-win.
»
» Child’s sunscreen and insect repellent: These are essential 
if you live in warm climates and in the summer, but the best 
form of protection is clothing and keeping out of the sun. 
Babies’ skin is a lot more sensitive than adults’ skin, so junior 
can burn even when he is not exposed to direct sunlight.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      81
»
» Digital thermometer: If junior is sick with a cold or flu, you 
can help determine when it’s time to whip him off to the 
doctor by using a digital thermometer to check his tempera-
ture. Take your baby’s temperature by putting the thermom-
eter under his arm, called the axillary temperature, or by 
using a digital thermometer that fits into the ear canal, if he’s 
older than 6 months. Temporal thermometers that are 
swept across the forehead can also be used. Most parents 
break out in a cold sweat at the thought of using a rectal 
thermometer, but it does give an extremely accurate 
reading. A reading of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or greater is 
considered a fever, no matter which thermometer you’re 
using.
»
» Nail clippers or baby nail scissors: Babies can scratch 
themselves easily, so you need to keep their nails short and 
neat. This is easier said than done. Try clippers or special 
baby scissors to see what works best for you. A nail file may 
also be easier to use on your wiggling baby.
»
» Pain reliever: Children’s acetaminophen or ibuprofen for 
kids is used for pain and fever after immunizations, teething, 
and fever when your baby has a cold. Use a plastic syringe 
with measurements marked on the side to dispense the 
medication and check with your doctor for the correct 
dosage (which is worked out by baby’s weight).
Aspirin is not suitable for young children and can be 
dangerous in some cases.
»
» Teething relief: Teething gels can help soothe a teething 
baby’s gums.
Check with your pediatrician before giving your baby any type of 
medication if he’s younger than six months old. Always check the 
label on any medical product (or any product, in fact) to make 
sure it’s suitable for your baby’s age. If you’re unsure whether it’s 
suitable, check with your pediatrician.
Be prepared to keep adding to your household first-aid kit with 
bandages, scissors, and tweezers as your little one gets older and 
encounters more little accidents.

82      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Being Prepared for  
What’s Coming
There’s so much to do and only nine months to do it in. Along 
with watching your partner’s belly grow and preparing for the 
biggest change in your life yet, you can do a whole bunch of things 
to minimize the chaos in your world right now and save yourself 
a bunch of grief down the line. Here are some ideas.
Finding out about pregnancy  
and babies
If you thought your school days were over, think again. Parenting 
education is upon you, and your partner may send you to prenatal 
classes! While most childbirth education or prenatal classes focus 
on the birth of your baby, it’s a good idea to pick up some tips 
and tricks about getting through the first few weeks and months. 
Fortunately there are now many courses available where, as a guy, 
you feel less awkward — some are designed just for dads.
You may wonder whether you really have to go to prenatal classes. 
The answer is yes — not necessarily because you learn amazing 
things, but because your partner appreciates it and you can net-
work with other couples and dads who are in the same boat.
Prenatal classes can also help you decide whether to go for a home 
birth, a hospital birth, or an elective cesarean, where you choose to 
have a cesarean on a particular day.
Class content varies wildly, so try to shop around early if you can 
and check what’s offered before you sign on the dotted line. Apart 
from the standard options we mention earlier, you can also find 
alternative classes or providers by asking your healthcare pro-
vider and checking with your friends who have had babies. Your 
local hospital will almost always provide some type of class, from 
labor prep to newborn care skills.

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      83
If you want to go beyond the basics of baby and child care, you 
can also check out courses that teach baby massage, baby sign 
language, and activities with babies.
Getting to the hospital (on time)
You’ve no doubt seen the movie where Mrs. Pregnant goes into 
labor and Mr. Pregnant drives like a crazy man to get to the hos-
pital before the baby’s born. If you’re having a hospital birth 
rather than a home birth, then some variation of the movie scene 
could well happen to you. We don’t advise driving fast or tearing 
around corners like a Formula One driver — after all, you want to 
all arrive in one piece at the hospital. Unlike the movies, a parking 
space will not magically appear right outside the delivery suite 
doors, so it pays to do a little investigative work about where you 
can park before the big day.
Have some cash in the hospital bag for parking, or check with the 
hospital when you do your hospital tour to see whether they have 
any special parking for families in the maternity ward.
You may also want to check some time in advance of the birth that 
you know how to get to the hospital. Some people do a test run to 
see how long it takes them. You don’t want to be messing around 
with the GPS or maps on the way there. Your partner may not 
thank you for having to spend any more time squashed in the car 
while going through contractions than she has to.
You may also want to consider the following:
»
» Does the car have all the necessary bits and pieces of 
paperwork, such as an up-to-date license, registration, and 
insurance card?
»
» Is the car accessible night and day, or is it blocked in by other 
cars sometimes?
»
» If your car is out of action, is there someone you can call as a 
back-up?
»
» Is there enough gas in the tank to get you there?
»
» Do you have a car seat to transport your baby home?

84      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Assembling home birthing  
equipment
If you’re having a hospital birth, you don’t need to bring anything 
to the delivery suite other than your beloved and her hospital bag, 
which in some instances can be pretty big indeed. But if you’re 
having the birth at home, you need some equipment to prepare 
for the big day. Your midwife will undoubtedly give you a com-
prehensive and somewhat daunting list that may include the fol-
lowing items:
»
» A birthing pool: These can be rented or purchased from 
private companies; your midwife will probably know of a 
source. Some can even be used as a paddling pool for your 
child afterwards.
»
» A container for the placenta, unless you’re burying it in the 
backyard.
»
» Towels: These are for cleaning up and wrapping the baby in 
after birth, and for mom and dad if you’ve both been in the 
pool.
»
» Waterproof mats to cover your carpet: A tarp covered 
with newspaper and an old blanket or sheets should do it.
Packing the hospital bag(s)
The old conundrum of knowing what to take on vacation and what 
to leave behind is nothing compared to the quandary of what to 
take to the hospital when your baby is on her way. Packing the 
hospital bag is often broken down into three sections — things 
needed for mom during the birth, things needed for mom after 
the birth, and things needed for the baby. Things needed for dad 
often get a bit neglected, because fathers weren’t welcome any-
where near the action for a long time. Fortunately times have 
changed, and chances are you are the best man for the job to get 
organized about Project Birth. Here are some suggestions for a 
mom-, baby-, and dad-friendly hospital bag:

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      85
What the parents need  
during the birth
You’ll need some or all of the following items for the big event:
»
» Camera and batteries: Make sure you know how to use all 
the buttons.
»
» Cellphone and charger: Check with the hospital before 
making phone calls to announce your little one’s arrival, 
because some hospitals don’t allow cellphones to be used 
inside.
»
» Music, pictures, and other personal items: Take anything 
that you and your partner think will make the labor easier by 
setting a nice mood. Check with your healthcare providers 
first, because some hospitals may not allow some personal 
items in the delivery suite.
»
» Snacks and drinks: Some labors can take a long time 
(24 hours is not unusual), and it’s hard work on mom doing 
all the pushing and dad doing all that supporting. Nuts, 
chocolate, energy drinks, power bars, crackers, or whatever 
you like can be packed in a lunchbox for you to nibble on 
during the labor. If she’s in the hospital, your partner may 
not be allowed anything more than ice chips, so take your 
goodies out of her sight to munch or slurp on.
»
» The appropriate clothing: Mom’s feet may get cold during a 
long labor, so pack a pair of nice, comfy, soft socks. If you’re 
having a water birth, you may want to pack a pair of shorts 
so you can get in the pool too.
There may be a lot of waiting around, so pack a book or some-
thing to keep you occupied. However, remember what you’re 
really there for — getting into a good book may not be the best 
way to spend your time when you’re supposed to be supporting 
your partner.
What mom needs after the birth
In all likelihood, you’ll be spending a few hours with your new 
baby, calling everyone you want to call and feeling a little giddy. 
You’ll probably head home for a shower, something to eat, and 

86      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
some sleep. But mom needs at least these things to help her settle 
into her stay at the hospital:
»
» A change of clothes for coming home because it takes some 
time for a pregnant belly to shrink down enough to fit into 
pre-pregnancy clothes. Reminding mom of this before she 
ever leaves the hospital could depress her unnecessarily.
»
» Lanolin nipple cream that doesn’t need to be washed off 
before breastfeeding.
»
» Maternity bras and nursing pads in case of leaking breast 
milk.
»
» Maternity pads, though these can be supplied by the 
hospital.
»
» A pen and notebook for recording a few things after the 
birth.
»
» Pajamas or a nightie that opens at the front for breastfeed-
ing, a dressing gown, and slippers. Some women prefer to 
wear the hospital’s gowns at first, so they don’t ruin their 
own gowns with bodily fluids (which are often copious after 
delivery).
»
» Soft cotton undies. Pregnant tummies don’t disappear 
immediately, so her maternity undies may be best.
»
» Usual toiletries your partner would take on vacation, such as 
a toothbrush, shampoo, cleanser, deodorant, moisturizer, lip 
balm, contact lens supplies, hair bands and brush, and any 
medications.
What baby needs after the birth
The little person you’ll be taking home will need the following 
items:
»
» Disposable diapers: Even if you are going to use cloth 
diapers, meconium, the sticky, tarlike stool your baby expels 
in the first few days after birth, is best handled by disposable 
diapers as meconium can be hard to get out of cloth ones. 

CHAPTER 4  Preparing for a Baby in the House      87
Many hospitals won’t give away free diapers to take home 
anymore, so be prepared and take a few extra for the ride 
home.
»
» Pacifier: While a pacifier is probably one of the most 
commonly known baby accessories, lactation consultants 
may not be that happy about you giving your little champ a 
pacifier if you’re experiencing breastfeeding difficulties, 
because pacifiers are believed to cause “nipple confusion” in 
some cases.
»
» Supplies for bottle feeding: Formula (newborn), bottles, 
nipples, and a bottle warmer if you’re going to bottle feed.
»
» Blankets: It’s safer to put a blanket over the baby after he’s 
in his car seat than to put a heavy coat on him. It’s difficult to 
tighten the straps enough to keep him safe if he’s wearing 
heavy outer clothing.
»
» Something to wear: A couple of newborn-sized all-in-ones 
with feet and long sleeves, some hats, and some socks or 
booties. Newborns are used to being in a nice hot spa pool 
and have no way to control their temperature yet, so even in 
summer they need to be kept warm. You may also have a 
special “coming home” outfit picked out.
Check with a lactation consultant for any breastfeeding equip-
ment, aids, or remedies your partner may need.
Surviving the baby shower
It’s no longer strictly true that baby showers are all about mom, 
where a bunch of women sit around drinking tea and playing 
games like “guess what mess is in that diaper.” Dads are get-
ting in on the act too. No, not sitting around eating sandwiches 
and oohing over Aunt Vera’s knitted booties, but getting together 
to mark your transition into fatherhood. It could be going out 
with friends or a joint occasion with both you and your partner’s 
friends.
We definitely recommend having a “man shower” to celebrate 
the occasion (and no, your man shower’s unlikely to be similar to 
your bachelor party. Or at least, it better not be).

88      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Working with checklists
In all the excitement of becoming a father, it’s really easy to for-
get stuff, so devise a comprehensive list of everything you think 
you’ll need and put it somewhere you can’t miss it. Don’t leave it 
up to your memory — you’re bound to forget something.
Your checklist should include:
»
» Car seat: Do you have a car seat and know how to fit it into 
your car?
»
» Home birth list: Mats to protect floors, home birth pool if 
you want it, towels for yourself and the baby, any other 
requirements your midwife needs.
»
» Nursery: Baby has somewhere to sleep and bedding to 
sleep in, baby has clothes to wear, you have something to 
store clothes in, baby has diapers and bottom protection, 
you have something to change baby on.
»
» Pet care: Who will look after any pets during the birth while 
you’re not at home?
»
» Phone list: Should include emergency numbers, your 
healthcare provider, friends, family, and work.
»
» Your hospital bags: For during the birth, for the hospital 
stay, and for baby.
»
» Your transport: Ensure your car has all its paperwork and 
gas, you know your way to the hospital, you have parking 
money, and you know where parking is.
If you’ve decided on a hospital birth, check out your options (if 
you have several hospitals to choose from) because standards and 
facilities vary significantly. Most hospitals offer special tours for 
pregnant couples to see what the facilities are like and where you 
need to go on D-day. This tour is really useful because you can 
check out details and take lots of time to ask everything you ever 
wanted to know about giving birth in a hospital.

It’s Showtime! 
Birth
B
eing born is, ironically, one of the most dangerous things 
you do in your life. In third-world countries, just being 
born or having a baby can be risky. That said, infant mor-
tality rates are at the lowest in history and constantly dropping. In 
most first-world countries, problems during birth are rare and 
plenty of help is available if things start to go south during 
delivery.
But that doesn’t mean you can take everything for granted. You 
need to know what’s going on during birth. Knowledge is power, 
so we’ve put together this chapter to keep you in the loop. That 
said, no two births are the same and no one can tell you what’s 
going to happen during the birth of your child. The process may 
seem a bit random and very drawn out, but usually that’s just part 
of the journey to dadhood.
In this chapter you find out about the different phases and stages 
of labor, see how to recognize when real labor starts, and discover 
when to call your care provider. We discuss strategies for making 

90      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
labor less of a pain for your partner and how to keep both of you 
sane during this trying time. We also give you some advice on 
keeping your cool at the big moment when your child is born and 
guide you through the heady first minutes, hours, and days as a 
father.
The Final Countdown
The nursery is ready, the freezer is stocked with meals, the car 
seat is installed, and you may be pacing around the house waiting 
for it all to start happening. It’s like sitting in a reception room, 
waiting for your name to be called so you can finally become a 
dad. Keep yourself occupied with some last-minute tasks and a 
bit of brushing up on what happens during and immediately after 
labor.
Discovering what you need  
to know about labor
You can’t be too prepared for labor. And as you’re number one in 
the pit crew, understanding what’s going on is essential. To help 
you get your head around this momentous occasion, Appendix B 
outlines terms used in labor and birth to help you understand 
what’s going on.
There’s a lot to take in, so here’s a quick guide to what generally 
happens during labor.
Like many good things in life, labor happens in three stages:
»
» The first stage is when your partner’s cervix softens, then 
widens, called dilation, making space for the baby to come 
through and out of the uterus. The uterus contracts at 
regular intervals, allowing the baby to come through. The 
contractions become increasingly painful. These are those 
contractions you’ve heard so much about on movies and TV. 
The cervix is fully dilated at ten centimeters. For a first birth, 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      91
the first stage takes an average of 6 to 14 hours (but can take 
a day or more), so you can see that your presence with a 
strong shoulder and heat packs galore will really help.
»
» The second stage is the pushing stage, and ends when the 
baby actually comes out. The second stage is also helped 
along by contractions that increase in length and intensity 
during this stage. Finally, your little one is born!
»
» The third stage is a little less glamorous (as if birth is at all 
glamorous) and involves the placenta, that lifeline to your 
baby, being delivered. The placenta is also called afterbirth. It 
takes from five minutes to an hour to appear after the baby 
does. Most women are too exhausted by this stage, or 
energized by finally meeting their baby, to notice much 
about expelling the placenta.
Think that’s all there is to it? Nope! The first stage also has three 
phases, and your partner will probably be too caught up in the 
moment to recognize them as they happen to her:
»
» Latent phase: Contractions are 5 to 20 minutes apart and 
become more frequent as they progress. The cervix dilates 
to about 3 centimeters.
»
» Active phase: This phase is characterized by the cervix 
dilating from about 3 centimeters to fully dilated. 
Contractions increase in length and intensity, coming every 
three to five minutes and lasting around 60 seconds, so your 
partner doesn’t have a lot of downtime to think about 
anything. It’s up to you to recognize what’s happening and 
get things organized. This is usually when getting to the 
hospital or opening the door for the midwife to deliver your 
baby at home is right up there on your to-do list.
»
» Transition: Okay, your partner’s allowed to lose it now — and 
probably will. This is the point just before the pushing starts. 
Contractions are very intense, sometimes overwhelming, and 
your partner may say things like “I can’t do it!” (plus a whole 
lot of swear words we don’t need to list here, including some 
aimed directly at you. Don’t worry — this too shall pass!).

92      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
One of the more obvious signs that things are about to kick off 
is when your partner’s water breaks. This usually happens in 
the most inappropriate situation — but hey, it’s all natural, so 
don’t be too embarrassed when the big box store you’re browsing 
through has to call for a “cleanup in aisle one.” However, labor 
doesn’t always follow immediately on the heels of membrane 
rupture. It may, but in some cases labor starts up to 24 hours 
after her water breaks. Either way, call your doctor or midwife 
to inform them that her water has broken; in some cases, your 
doctor may want her to come to the hospital to be checked. Read 
about more signs of the first stage of labor later in this chapter.
Understanding your role in labor
We’ve talked a lot about supporting and being there for your part-
ner. So what does “being there” really mean? Ask a lot of dads 
who have been through the birth of their children and the first 
answer that may spring to mind is “stand around like an idiot and 
feel guilty and inadequate.” It’s easy to feel sidelined when the 
focus is on your partner and she’s in kind of a crabby mood with 
you, which you would be too if you had seven pounds of person 
coming out of an orifice. She’s focusing on what her body is doing; 
listening to the coaching and advice of her midwife, nurses, or 
obstetrician; and coping with pain, hormones, and emotions you 
can’t even begin to imagine (and don’t want to).
In general your partner relies on you to sort out a long list of sup-
port tasks that you can do with dignity and humility. So if your 
partner needs a shoulder to hang onto for leverage when she’s 
pushing, give it to her. If she needs three ice chips and a back rub, 
get them for her. If your partner says she can’t do it anymore, tell 
her with conviction that she can. Being there means taking care 
of your partner when she needs you to and, most importantly, 
taking charge when she needs you to. Labor can be totally over-
whelming for your partner, and she’s vulnerable to every emo-
tion in the book. She’s also vulnerable to being pushed around 
by the hospital system: an obstetrician who may be angling for a 
cesarean birth when your partner is dead set against it and wants 
to keep pushing for a bit longer, or an overly pushy lactation con-
sultant who is stressing out your exhausted partner. If something 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      93
doesn’t feel right, you have to make a decision for the good of 
your partner and baby and advocate on their behalf. It’s all about 
your family, so you get to be “the man who calls the shots” when 
push comes to shove.
Dads can really make their role count during labor by being
»
» A link to the outside world. Let friends and family know 
what’s going on, because they’ll be eager to hear how the 
birth’s going. You can also be the first to announce to the 
world that your new son or daughter has arrived — a very 
special thing to be able to do!
»
» Strong. Help out where you can by making sure your 
partner is as comfortable as she can be, is well stocked with 
whatever makes her comfortable, and is warm or cool 
enough.
»
» The rational calm voice in the hustle and bustle. Even 
when things get stressful or hectic, try to keep your cool on 
your partner’s behalf and advocate for her if things are 
slipping out of control.
Take your cues from your partner. Her needs are pretty specific, 
and she’ll let you know about them. But don’t try to tell your part-
ner you know how she feels, because you don’t. Any complaining 
(to her) of any sort from your end may not be received well.
THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT
If you have a smartphone, it probably won’t surprise you to find out 
that there are apps specifically designed to monitor the duration and 
frequency of your partner’s screaming (read contractions) during 
labor. Here are a few current, free apps for smartphones:
•	 Contraction Master Free (iPhone and Android)
•	 Contraction Timer (iPhone and Android)
•	 Easy Contraction Timer (Android)
•	 Full Term (iPhone and Android)

94      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Have a standby support person in case labor goes on for a long 
time, or you desperately need some rest. Talk about who would be 
suitable with your partner. Perhaps her sister or mother could fill 
in for you while you have a meal or take a breather. You’ll be of 
very little use if you pass out from exhaustion or starvation.
Getting ready with last-minute 
preparations
As you count down the days to your partner’s due date, you can 
be feeling all sorts of things — excitement about meeting your 
baby for the first time, or absolute terror about the reality of your 
new responsibility. It’s okay; we’ve been there. You may also be a 
bit worried about how you’ll handle the labor, your role in it, and 
how well your partner will cope. Worrying is okay, and yes, lots of 
guys cry, pass out, or throw up during labor, which is all part of 
the journey. Basically just ride it out.
Before the fun starts, double-check (or triple-check) a few things, 
such as ensuring you’ve
»
» Arranged for someone to look after your pets/plants and 
clear your mail (you may be gone some time)
»
» Briefed people at work, or left handover notes or contact 
details in case you need to leave suddenly
»
» Charged your camera batteries or packed charging cords
»
» Got the hospital bags packed and ready to go, even if you’re 
planning a home birth, in case you need to transfer to a 
hospital in a hurry
»
» Made sure the car seat is ready to go and have practiced 
putting it in and taking it out of the car
»
» Stored phone numbers of friends and family on your 
cellphone and packed your charger
The checklists in Chapter 4 will help you remember anything you 
may have forgotten.

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      95
BRING IT ON!
Though only five percent of babies are born on their due date, pass-
ing that magical day without a babe in her arms will probably weigh 
on your partner’s mind. She may have been viewing the due date as 
the finish line and to go over it without a result may push her to the 
end of her rope. By now, the less desirable effects of pregnancy, like 
fluid retention, heartburn, insomnia, weight gain, shortness of breath, 
waddling, and having that baby kick her insides won’t be such a nov-
elty. Your partner wants her body back and your baby out.
There are techniques you can try to help bring on labor and some can 
even be fun, but none can guarantee results. No doubt everyone you 
meet who has asked you “Is the baby here yet?” will follow up with 
one of these ideas. Don’t try any of them without discussing it with 
your partner’s care provider first.
•	 Drink castor oil. Drinking castor oil to cause diarrhea is an old-
fashioned way of bringing on labor. We don’t recommend drinking 
castor oil because it tastes pretty nasty and may not accomplish 
anything outside of an uncomfortable case of diarrhea.
•	 Have acupuncture or acupressure. Some people swear by the 
results of having acupuncture needles or pressure applied to cer-
tain points of the body. Others think it’s coincidental when labor 
naturally happens soon after the procedure’s done.
•	 Have sex. The prostaglandin in your semen may help to ripen the 
cervix, making it ready to dilate.
•	 Make your loved one a spicy meal. The aim is to give your part-
ner diarrhea, which can start contractions. It may just give her 
more heartburn or abdominal discomfort, though.
•	 “Sweep the membranes” or “strip and stretch.” Sometimes 
called having a “sweep” done, during this rather uncomfortable 
procedure the midwife or doctor puts their fingers inside the 
cervix. Once inside, they stretch open the cervix and strip mem-
branes away from it. This is not a do-it-yourself project — ever!
•	 Take a walk together. The rocking motion may help stimulate 
contractions.

Action! The Process of Labor
Your partner thinks something may be happening. Don’t panic. It 
may be launch time, or it may be a false alarm.
When you think she’s in labor
You will have signs that the birth of your baby is not far away, but 
it can be days or weeks before full-on labor really starts.
Here are some indicators that things are about to get interesting, 
but you shouldn’t get too excited yet:
»
» A bloody show or mucus plug: The mucus plug that blocks 
the cervix during pregnancy comes away, along with blood 
from broken capillaries in the cervix. This usually happens 
when the cervix begins to dilate slightly and can happen 
weeks before labor actually starts.
»
» Braxton-Hicks contractions: These are mild contractions, 
like a strong period pain or cramps. They’re not labor 
contractions, but may be confused with them.
»
» Intense or increasing back pain: This pain can also be a 
sign that things are beginning to happen.
»
» Loose bowel movements: A few days before labor, the 
body releases prostaglandins, which help soften the cervix in 
preparation for dilation. Prostaglandins also cause things to 
be a bit lax in the bowel department.
Your partner isn’t considered overdue until 42 weeks after concep-
tion. If labor hasn’t happened, you can discuss with your care provider 
if and when to induce the baby. This involves using prostaglandin to 
ripen the cervix, rupturing the amniotic sac, and using Pitocin, a syn-
thetic form of oxytocin, to start contractions.
 (continued)

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      97
Don’t worry if none of the things in the preceding list happens 
before the contractions start. Every labor, birth, and woman is 
different, so call your care provider if you’re not sure about what’s 
happening.
When the first stage of labor begins, it may feel like birth is really 
happening, but it isn’t yet. The difference between the latent 
phase (also sometimes called early labor) and the active phase 
(sometimes called active labor) of the first stage of labor is the 
length and intensity of contractions. If you’re still a bit confused 
about the various stages and phases of labor, check the definitions 
earlier in this chapter.
Call your midwife, obstetrician, or other caregiver for support. 
She can give you guidance on whether you need to grab the car 
keys, settle in for the evening, or stay on full alert with a stop-
watch in your hand.
When your partner  
is really in labor
All aboard the roller coaster get buckled in, because you’re in for 
a real treat. The birth of a child happens everywhere around the 
world thousands of times a day. And you can bet that every birth 
happening right now is unique. Lucky you — you get to be part 
of your baby’s story right now. The high of seeing a child born is 
like nothing on Earth — and you’re about to meet your own child. 
How cool is that?
First things first. You’ll know your partner is in labor because
»
» Contractions are regular, lasting 45–60 seconds, and 
increasing in frequency.
»
» Contractions are getting stronger and your partner may not 
be able to speak during a contraction.
»
» Progressive cervical dilation is occurring.
Time to call your care provider if you haven’t already.

98      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Helping your partner  
through childbirth
Many women spend the latent phase of labor at home, where 
they’re more comfortable and have lots of room to move around. 
Even if you’re planning a hospital birth, it may pay to stay at 
home for as long as is feasible. Some women who go to the hos-
pital too early tense up because they’re at the hospital and later 
on experience fatigue earlier than if they’d stayed at home lon-
ger. Contractions shouldn’t be too unmanageable, and you can try 
these techniques to relieve whatever pain your partner is feeling:
»
» Apply a hot water bottle to your partner’s lower back where 
she feels the most pain.
»
» Give your partner a gentle back rub with some almond or 
olive oil.
»
» Help her sit up in place if she decides to have epidural 
anesthesia.
»
» Keep your partner moving, if she’s up to it. Movement can 
help labor progress, and gravity means the baby’s weight 
puts pressure on the cervix, helping it to dilate.
»
» Run a bath or turn on the shower for your partner. If her 
water has broken, her care provider may not want her to get 
in the tub, so ask first.
»
» Turn down the lights.
As contractions get stronger and you move into the active phase, 
transition, and the second stage of labor, you can carry on with 
these pain-relief techniques. Let your partner guide you as to 
what she needs. At some points your partner won’t have any 
energy in her body to do anything other than ride out a contrac-
tion, ­especially in the second stage when she’s putting everything 
into pushing the baby out. Holding up your partner’s body and 
letting her lean on you in whatever way she needs helps your 
partner a lot.

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      99
Keeping sane
Labor can take a long time. You may get a chance to have a 
breather between contractions, or you may not. Giving all your 
energy to your partner is exhausting, so try to take some time out 
for yourself as well if you can.
It may help to have some people on speed-dial that you can call 
if it all becomes too much. Check with your partner before the big 
day, because it would be terrible to have a person turn up during 
labor who your partner really doesn’t want to see there.
Acceptable things for dads to do during labor include
»
» Supporting your partner’s decisions — to take pain medica-
tion or not, to have an epidural or not
»
» Crying when the baby is here
»
» Doing some stretching exercises to keep fresh and fend off 
sleep
I’LL HAVE WHAT SHE’S HAVING
Meg Ryan may have been faking an orgasm in the hit movie When 
Harry Met Sally, but we doubt the handful of women starring in the 
documentary Orgasmic Birth were. Yes, you heard us. Natural birth 
advocates Ina May Gaskin and Sheila Kitzinger have long said that 
birth doesn’t have to be about pain and can be so pain free as to be 
“ecstatic” or even orgasmic. Giving birth at home, in an intimate set-
ting like one in which you’d make love, can be quite a different experi-
ence from giving birth in a hospital under bright lights knowing some 
stranger could walk in at any moment. Women who’ve had orgasmic 
births report feeling waves of pleasure with each contraction, which 
peak again and again. During labor, oxytocin and endorphins flood 
the body. These hormones are also released during sex.
Having an orgasmic birth shouldn’t be the goal for women, advocates 
say, but it’s worth recognizing that labor doesn’t have to be a pain. If it 
happens to your partner — lucky you!

100      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
»
» Drinking water
»
» Eating snacks (not in front of your partner, unless she’s 
allowed to eat, too)
»
» Fainting (warn the nurses first, so they can move all equip-
ment out of the way)
»
» Getting some fresh air — as long as it’s brief
»
» Going to the toilet (as long as it’s not too often and doesn’t 
take too long)
»
» Leaving the room because you’re about to be sick or faint
The following actions are really in stark contrast to the future 
super dad you’re aiming to be:
»
» Bringing your best friends or work buddies into the delivery 
suite
»
» Doing work on your laptop
»
» Leaving the hospital to participate in your weekly poker game
»
» Playing video games on your cellphone
»
» Sneaking into the birthing suite next door to sip from your 
pocket flask
»
» Taking photos of other women in labor
»
» Telling your partner to keep it down because you’re negotiat-
ing a business deal on the phone
»
» Watching your favorite show on TV (unless your partner 
wants to see it too while she is riding out the contractions)
»
» Peeing your pants because it’s all too emotional
Giving nature a helping hand
Sometimes during labor nature needs help to get your baby out into 
the world. There are lots of reasons for this: The baby may be in 
distress, or your partner’s health is in jeopardy, or she’s exhausted 
and wants the baby out immediately! None of these interventions 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      101
can really be anticipated. Keep in touch with your partner, and if 
she’s adamant she doesn’t want any intervention, be her advocate.
When the medical equipment comes out, try not to freak out. 
Some of it can look scarier than it really is. The equipment’s going 
to help you meet your baby sooner rather than later.
Vacuum extraction
A vacuum extractor helps pull the baby out of the birth canal. It’s 
used when the baby’s head is low in the birth canal but needs an 
extra bit of oomph to help him along. The baby’s heart rate may 
indicate he’s in distress, or his position is making it tricky for him 
to be born naturally.
A suction cup is put onto the baby’s head and your partner may 
have to have an episiotomy, which is a cut to the vaginal opening 
to make room for the cup to go in. A vacuum delivery can cause 
swelling to the top of the baby’s head, but usually causes little or 
no trauma to the mother and baby.
Forceps
Forceps look like a scary pair of tongs. They are used to grip the 
baby’s head on both sides and pull him out of the birth canal. For-
ceps aren’t used as often as the vacuum these days because of the 
risk that the mother’s insides can be damaged, not to mention the 
bruising and risk of damage to the baby’s head. An episiotomy is 
routinely required as well.
Emergency caesarean
The big daddy of medical interventions during labor is the emer-
gency cesarean. They’re called “emergency” to distinguish them 
from elective cesareans where you opt for birth this way. All 
cesareans take place in an operating room, so you’ll have to dress 
for the part by wearing a gown and covering your face and hair 
(or head, as the case may be.) Your partner is given an epidural or 
spinal anesthetic to numb pain (although in some cases the cesar-
ean has to be performed under general anesthesia), and an inci-
sion is made in your partner’s belly, usually near the pubic bone, 
known as a bikini cut. The abdominal muscles are parted and the 
peritoneal cavity is opened to make way for the uterus. The uterus 
is then opened, and the baby and placenta are brought out.

102      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Having a cesarean isn’t an “easy” way of having a baby; it’s major 
surgery, and you may not want to look behind the sheet that stops 
your partner from seeing her insides come out. Having a cesarean 
also means your partner will take weeks to recover, and she won’t 
be able to drive or lift anything heavy for up to six weeks. She will 
also be on pain medication and will have to rest a lot as she recov-
ers, and she’ll stay in the hospital for four days or so.
If your partner had her heart set on a vaginal birth or a natural 
drug-free birth and it hasn’t worked out that way, she’ll be feel-
ing disappointed and upset with herself. Add this to the hormones 
rampaging through her body and you have one sad new mom. 
Give her all the love and support you can muster right now; she 
needs you.
The Big Moment Has Arrived
The moment your child is born is a peak experience that’s dif-
ficult to describe — totally unique, beautiful, and out of this 
world. Enjoy it. You may find yourself shedding a tear or two 
at this important moment. Don’t hold back, being emotional is 
totally cool and you’re definitely not a lesser man for it (quite the 
opposite in fact, we think). Cherish this snapshot in time because 
the moment you lay eyes on your child for the first time can’t be 
rehearsed or repeated.
Cutting the cord
Dad — because that’s what you are now — this is your chance 
to shine. You now have another important job to do, should you 
choose to accept it, and if your care provider offers. (Complications 
right after birth might make this unadvisable.) After the baby is 
born and she is coping on her own without help from mom, the 
umbilical cord is clamped and set up for you to cut. This small 
task can take on several significant meanings for your new fam-
ily. For your partner, cutting the cord can represent the end of her 
pregnancy and the start of motherhood. For you it may symbolize 
your part in your new family. Most importantly for your little one, 
cutting the cord symbolizes a point in time where all life support 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      103
systems from mom are cut off and his body has to sustain him. 
Cutting the cord is a big deal, so embrace the significance and 
enjoy the procedure.
The cord is really rather thick and gnarly, so apply some elbow 
grease and give it a good strong cut. You may want to ask your 
nurse, midwife, or other support person to take a photo.
When time stops: Meeting  
your baby
So you’re looking at your child for the first time. It can be incred-
ible, scary, bewildering, and amazing, all in the space of a few 
seconds. Time seems to stop as you feel all these emotions wash-
ing over you.
Take a moment now to have a good look at what’s been cooking 
for nine months — little fingers, little toes — as mom may have 
her hands full being taken care of by medical staff right now.
Notice all his little features and enjoy the amazing sight of a new-
born baby. Typically there is no rush anymore once your baby has 
been checked and is handed to you. So you can easily take some 
time out to make your first acquaintance with the little one. What 
a great start to a lifelong bond. As dads you often get to spend 
time with your little ones first! How cool is that?
Keeping your cool
It’s been a long day or two. You’ve let your partner and your mid-
wife or doctor guide you through the process, and you have to 
admit to yourself you’ve been a pretty damn awesome support 
crew. You’ve advocated for your partner, you’ve kept her well 
stocked with whatever she needed, and she’s right now look-
ing forward to some cuddle time with your baby and a good rest. 
But you may find the demands of the system — your healthcare 
provider needs to zip off to another appointment before you’re 
ready, you can’t be transferred from the delivery suite to the ward 
because of paperwork — will override you right now, so keep 
advocating for your partner and child if they need it.

104      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
Welcoming Your Baby  
to the Real World
It may be tempting once baby has finally arrived to think that the 
hard work is over. You may be gazing blissfully at your new baby, 
frantically calling family, or tempted to run to the shop for cigars. 
Cool it for a few minutes more, because there’s more stuff to get 
through.
What happens immediately  
after birth
Making sure your new baby is in good health is top priority. Most 
likely, your baby has come out a rather scary shade of blue or gray, 
but within a few minutes of breathing actual air, she starts to take 
on a rosier complexion. She’s covered in vernix, the waxy coating 
that protected her skin in the womb. Your baby may even have a 
pointy head, caused by her soft baby skull plates moving as she 
came down the birth canal. Yes, babies can be a bit of a sight when 
they first emerge into the world! Some babies howl when they’re 
born. Others just like to take things a bit more quietly and have a 
look around first.
If your baby needs a bit of help breathing, your caregiver may 
massage her back with a warm cloth, or suction fluid from her 
mouth or nose. Don’t worry; she’ll be just fine and pinking up 
within a minute or so.
At one minute after birth and five minutes after birth, your care 
provider does an Apgar test on your little one, giving her an Apgar 
score on a scale of one to ten, one being lowest and ten being high-
est. There are five criteria for your little miss to jump through: 
color, pulse rate, reflexes, muscle tone, and breathing. This test 
alerts your care provider to any concerns about the baby’s health. 
After her first test, your caregiver or nurse dries your baby and 
hopefully hands her over to mom for some skin-on-skin time 
before anything else. Hospital policies vary on this, but in the 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      105
user-friendly environment hospitals are trying to create, asking 
will usually get you what you want, as long as it’s safe for mom 
and baby.
Within a few minutes, your baby is breathing and surviving on 
her own. The umbilical cord stops pulsating, which means your 
caregiver will clamp it in two places and get it ready for cutting. 
This is your turn to shine, dad.
Your baby is then measured and weighed. Those details go into 
your child’s personal health book. Most places take a footprint 
from baby, and often a thumbprint from mom as well. Check with 
your caregiver if you would like to do one to keep, either in your 
baby book or on a keepsake.
While baby is snuggling with mom (or dad if mom’s too worn out), 
your caregiver puts a plastic band around her ankle or wrist — or 
both — with your names, date of birth, and weight. These can 
become mementos of your baby’s birth when they come off a few 
days later. In most places, mom gets a matching bracelet.
The first few hours
Once all the commotion has died down, there are a few practical 
matters to attend to. Have you started calling friends and family 
yet? Mom and baby usually have a bit of skin-on-skin time and 
get to know each other a bit first, then have something to eat.  
Yep — feeding your baby is going to be mom’s number-one 
­priority for some time, so they may as well get right into it now. 
Your care provider helps mom and baby get comfy with a first 
breastfeed, or if you’ve decided to bottle feed, helps with the 
mechanics of getting your little one taking her bottle.
Once that’s all taken care of, getting baby dressed and getting 
mom into clean, comfortable clothes and bed are next on the 
agenda. Mom will be pretty tired, so you may need to give her 
a hand standing up and getting about, especially if she’s had an 
epidural during labor. Or it may be your turn to get to know your 
baby a bit better while your partner’s occupied.

106      PART 1  From Here to Paternity: Conception to Birth
A bit of food and drink for mom is usually in order now, too. It’s 
been a long time since either of you had a decent meal. Taking 
care of any food cravings your partner couldn’t eat while being 
pregnant may also be high on the agenda. That said, all you may 
feel like is some well-deserved rest. If you are in a hospital, see to 
it that any formalities are dealt with quickly so you, your partner, 
and your little one can get some rest.
The first few days
Many parents have been lulled into thinking their baby is an angel 
in the first 24 hours. Babies can be very sleepy and settled for 
the first day, and you may be fooled! But it’s also a very busy 
time getting feeding established and finding your feet in your 
new role as dad. Your baby should be having about six feedings 
in a 24-hour period to start off with, so supporting mom by tak-
ing care of diaper changes, burping, or anything else that needs 
attending to can help her out a lot. If mom is still in the hospital, 
you can be a real hero dad for spending as much time as possible 
with the baby so your partner can rest some more. Many hospitals 
have 24-hour rooming-in for dads.
Meconium
Your perfect, cute little bundle will produce the foulest, stickiest, 
goopiest poop imaginable in the first few days of life. This black 
tar is called meconium, and it’s perfectly normal. Meconium is 
nature’s way of flushing out all the various fluids and contents of 
your baby’s intestines. The meconium is gone within a few days. 
After that your baby’s poop should turn to a strange orangey-
yellow color. The great news is a newborn’s stool hardly smells, 
easing you gently into the changing soiled diapers routine.
Going home
If your baby was born in the hospital, your care provider and the 
hospital decide when your partner and baby can go home. For 
some new moms, going home can’t come fast enough. Other 
moms may feel they need longer in the hospital for the support a 
24-hour on-call care provider brings, or they may not feel physi-
cally up to leaving the hospital, depending on how the birth went. 

CHAPTER 5  It’s Showtime! Birth      107
Don’t let the hospital push you out if you’re not ready for it. Talk 
about your concerns with your caregiver, but keep in mind that 
you can’t stay in the relative safety of the hospital forever!
Blues
About day three after birth, mom may be feeling a bit low. This is 
perfectly normal and will pass. Your partner may burst into tears 
for no reason (that she can tell you anyway) or just feel over-
whelmed by responsibility. If your partner had a hard pregnancy 
and is looking forward to getting her body back, finding it isn’t 
“back” yet may be very disappointing. Chances are your partner 
will also be sore in all sorts of places and performing simple per-
sonal hygiene tasks or even just going to the toilet can be really 
tricky. Do your dad thing and try to support your partner by help-
ing out, telling her she’s awesome, and enjoying your baby. By 
the way, these initial blues have nothing to do with postpartum 
depression, which is likely to come later if you or your partner 
ends up experiencing it. See Chapter 7 for more on postpartum 
depression.

Y
our baby is finally here. Does being a dad feel “real” now? 
If not, don’t worry. The first few days and weeks after birth 
can feel surreal. It does get better though. If you felt a bit 
left out during pregnancy and birth, now is your time to show 
your worth. Your baby is here and needs time with dad, as much 
time as possible. Realizing that your baby is an actual person and 
that you’re responsible for her now can also be quite daunting.
Every baby is different and every family is different. While this 
book is designed to take some of the mystery out of your mysteri-
ous newborn, no one can tell you how to take care of your baby 
as well as you can. In the coming days, weeks, and months, you’ll 
discover how to read your baby like no child-care professional, 
doctor, or midwife ever will. Yes, babies have similarities and out-
side help is there if you need it, but finding out how to read your 
baby is a skill you develop on your own. Every dad does.
In this chapter we give you some shortcuts on your journey to 
being a great dad with guides to the practical aspects of baby care, 
like changing diapers, dressing, and bathing your baby. You get 

112      PART 2  The First Year
the lowdown on feeding, sleeping, burping, and dealing with cry-
ing. We also talk about how having a baby shakes things up in your 
life like nothing else can and look at ways to cope with that change.
Dealing with the Aftershock
Starting out with your new baby — a vulnerable, unfathom-
able being — is a scary experience. Stepping through the door 
with your little bundle as you come home from the hospital, or 
­waving goodbye to the midwife if your baby was born at home, are 
momentous steps on the path to becoming a family. You may feel 
overwhelmed flying solo with your partner and the new baby, but 
that’s quite normal. Every parent in the world is probably feeling 
the same. Don’t stress; simply take each day as it comes.
It’s life but not as you know it
Remember when you slept in on the weekend, had a leisurely 
brunch with your partner, and then went for a walk, taking just 
the house keys and your wallet? You’ll be able to do that again, but 
not for many years. Getting your head around how life works now 
can be a struggle, but that’s where dads can shine once more. As 
dads, we’re great at adapting quickly to new situations and mak-
ing the best out of any challenge we face (say “yes!”).
Looking after a newborn is literally a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week 
job, and it’s exhausting. Expect your baby to sleep a lot in the first 
couple of days — it usually takes babies a few days to “come to 
life,” so don’t let her frequent sleep schedule in the hospital lull 
you into thinking you’ve got the perfect child. She may wake up 
with a vengeance the minute you walk through the front door!
But good baby or not so good, she needs a feeding every two to four 
hours, so even at night she’ll be waking up. Even if your partner is 
breastfeeding, you don’t get off night duty. You can help by doing 
any diaper changes and burping so your partner doesn’t feel she’s 
doing everything. If you’re bottle feeding, you can take turns so at 
least one of you gets a decent stretch of rest. Of course, if you go 
right back to work — not recommended if you can get a few weeks 

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      113
off for paternity leave — you may need to sleep during the week 
most nights and maybe do more weekend duty.
You may already be tired from supporting your partner after a 
long labor and birth, and because your baby is waking every few 
hours, you’re not getting a good eight hours of sleep like you used 
to. You can’t catch up on the sleep you’ve missed, but you can 
minimize your own exhaustion by resting when the baby sleeps. 
This goes for both you and your partner in these heady first days. 
It may pay to get used to the idea of taking turns for everything. 
While one of you is busy, the other should rest or catch up on 
some much-needed sleep. Here’s a perfect opportunity to shine 
as a dad by sharing the load with mom. Remember — apart from 
breastfeeding, dads can do everything a baby needs done, and 
there is no natural disadvantage or disposition. You are just as 
qualified at handling a newborn as mom. In other words, you both 
don’t know much and are learning as you go.
Any information you’ve read about caring for babies tells you 
there are lots of chores to do in the first weeks. That’s not nec-
essarily true. On days where everything goes smoothly — baby 
wakes, has a feeding, is burped, gurgles cutely for a bit, and then 
goes down for a nap without a whimper — you may wonder what 
all the fuss was about and sit around twiddling your thumbs. 
But not every day goes smoothly. And not every cycle of feeding, 
burping, and sleeping goes smoothly in a day. At any point the 
following may happen:
»
» Baby’s diaper overflows or leaks, necessitating not just a 
bath and clothing change — for both of you — but also a rug 
shampooing.
»
» Your baby shows symptoms you decide to have checked by 
your healthcare provider.
»
» Your baby spits up or vomits — copiously — after a feeding. As 
with a diaper change, this can set off a complete cleaning job.
Whenever you suddenly have to deal with something unexpected, 
your plan for the day is disrupted. Get used to it, as it happens a 
lot with children. Life becomes a lot less predictable, and plans go 
awry. But we think unpredictability’s a good thing, and you can 
enjoy it rather than choose to be a victim of it.

114      PART 2  The First Year
Expect to have to change your baby’s clothes (and yours) fre-
quently, clean the carpet or furniture, or visit the after-hours 
clinic. Your baby also may have days where she just refuses to 
sleep or cries incessantly — which is a special kind of torture — 
and you could end up spending an entire day or night rocking her, 
walking her in a stroller, or carrying her in a sling just to get some 
peace. If there’s one thing you can count on with newborns, it’s to 
expect the unexpected.
Take offers of help whenever you can. Grandmas are often chomp-
ing at the bit to come and help for a week or two, so let them, if 
you can do so without getting on each other’s nerves too badly. 
Having a neighbor or friend close to you who you can call when 
things are trying and who understands you’re running on empty 
is also very handy. You could ask your support people to drop off 
a meal for the two of you, take over pushing the stroller while you 
sit in the backyard away from the crying, or do a load of laundry. A 
few hours’ break from the baby can make all the difference.
If you feel you’re at the end of your rope, don’t despair. Get some-
one to give you a break for a couple of hours and chances are 
you’ll feel much better.
Meet the baby
It can be easy to fall into the trap of letting mom take care of 
everything to do with the baby. This is really easy to do as some 
new moms have a tendency to “take over” and secretly or uncon-
sciously harbor the belief that dads are somewhat inadequate 
when it comes to dealing with babies. Of course this is not so. 
There’s no reason to compete to see who is better at looking after 
a baby. In some cases, you may have to suggest that your partner 
go away — nicely, of course — and do something else while you 
look after the baby.
We highly recommend you take care of baby from the beginning so 
you become more and more confident at handling your baby. You 
can consider yourself “graduated” from dad school when you are 
perfectly happy to spend an entire day alone with your little one.
If you develop a mindset of seeing your baby as a developing 
person who needs your help every step of the way, rather than a 

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      115
source of work and chores, you’re already a winner in becoming 
a future super dad. If you’ve decided to adhere to a strict routine 
or the baby is unsettled or unwell, seeing him as a problem that 
needs to be fixed or a timetable that needs to be met can be tempt-
ing. He may seem like a blob that just eats, poops, and sleeps, 
but a lot’s going on inside that little baby right now. Although he 
can’t show you quite yet, he’s getting to know you, too.
Babies don’t generally smile until six weeks, although they can 
appear to be smiling, which is nice even if it is uncontrolled. 
You’ll know when the smile is intentional. He’ll look you in the 
eye and his face will light up like you’re the best thing he’s ever 
seen, which of course you are. In the early weeks your newborn 
will stare at you, checking out your face, learning the sound of 
your voice, and snuggling into you for snoozes. These are impor-
tant bonding times.
When your baby holds your gaze and checks you out in detail, a lot 
of developmental work is happening in his brain. Give him every 
opportunity to look at you without feeling like you have to do some-
thing else to entertain him, like jiggling him around or throwing 
him up in the air. Breastfeeding moms have the advantage that this 
happens naturally during feedings, so you need to carve out some 
extra time with baby to get your fair share of baby time.
Be a 100-percent dad. Do the full spectrum of care tasks —  
­changing your daughter’s diapers, bathing her, and wiping spit-
up off your shoulder — in the first few days, because that’s how 
your baby bonds with you. Performing these tasks tends to give 
you a different perspective on life, and after a while you may find 
that little dramas like baby poop on the carpet are really no big 
deal.
You’ve got the blues, too
Expect mom to shed some tears in the first week. Hormones are 
playing war games in her body right now, and she’ll be up and 
down like a yo-yo. Sometimes the best you can do is to listen, 
remain calm even if she yells at you, and stay positive at all times. 
These are just clouds passing, and chances are her mood will 
change in a few hours. So don’t sweat the small quarrels, emo-
tional outbursts, or little annoyances.

116      PART 2  The First Year
What you may not know is that dads can get the blues after birth 
too. At these times communicating well with your partner about 
what you’re going through is really important.
Sometimes the blues can morph into postpartum depression, 
a serious mental health issue for new parents. Have a look at 
­Chapter 7 for more about postpartum depression.
YOUNG DADS
Being a father, no matter the age when you become one, is about 
commitment — commitment to being there for a new young life, 
guiding that new person toward adulthood and independence. For 
young men who find themselves becoming fathers, the commitment 
is no different, although without the advantages of age and maturity, 
fatherhood can be even more of a challenge.
In addition, your relationship with the mother may not be a stable 
one, your parents may think you’re too young and therefore not pre-
pared to be a father, and there may be tension between your family 
and the mother’s. Some people may think it’s better not to have the 
baby at all.
But the more you show you’re committed, the more people will 
respect your determination, and the more your baby will feel the love 
and security having a father brings. You can show your commitment 
by being involved with your baby from the day you find out your part-
ner is pregnant. Go to pregnancy checkups and prenatal classes, start 
making arrangements for how you’ll financially support your partner 
and child, and show that you’re man enough for this very important 
job. Enlist the support of both your and your partner’s families.
To be legally recognized as the baby’s father, you need to have your 
name on the child’s birth certificate. Doing so makes it easier for you 
to have access to him if your relationship with his mother breaks 
down.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      117
Looking after a Newborn
So now that you’ve got the baby, what do you do with him? How 
do you look after him? Feeling responsible for a new person can 
be hugely overwhelming, but babies are pretty straightforward. 
All they really need is love, food, warmth, sleep, and a clean pair 
of pants.
In general, newborns exist in a 24-hour cycle of sleeping, feeding, 
being awake, and sleeping again. Your baby tires very easily and is 
awake for only about an hour or so at a time. A large chunk of that 
time he’s being fed, burped, and changed if necessary, but there’s 
time for a bit of interaction with dad, like story time (tell him 
anything you want — he loves to hear your voice), a few songs, or 
even a walk outside together before the next nap time.
You’ll usually see your baby’s healthcare provider (usually a pedi-
atrician) in the first few weeks after the birth to monitor your 
baby’s growth and your partner’s well-being, and to see how 
you’re getting on in your new lives as a family. Your partner will 
also see her obstetrician or other healthcare provider around 6 
weeks after birth. So if you ever feel you don’t know where to turn 
or who to turn to, your healthcare providers should be your first 
port of call.
See the contact details in Appendix A for people to call in your 
area. Help isn’t far away.
Get a fridge magnet (or make yourself one) with phone num-
bers of your healthcare provider, community health nurse, or 
­breastfeeding organization. Phone numbers of national health 
organizations such as Le Leche League are listed in Appendix A.
Getting your hands dirty
In your role of dad you get to master a few practical jobs that are 
probably entirely new to you — until now.

118      PART 2  The First Year
Diaper changing 101
There’s no magic to changing a diaper; they’re actually really easy 
to change (see Figure 6-1). Being prepared before you start is the 
key, as is keeping cool when the diaper you’re taking off is fuller 
than you thought it was. To change a diaper, you need
Illustration by Kathryn Born, MA
FIGURE 6-1: How to change a diaper.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      119
»
» A changing table or changing mat on the floor, bed, or sofa 
where you have lots of space around you and good access to 
your baby lying in front of you
»
» A clean diaper and diaper cream or powder ready to go
»
» A small plastic bag to put the soiled diaper in
»
» Baby wipes or a bowl of warm water and some cotton wool 
or cloth standing by to wash baby’s bottom
»
» Towels or extra cloth diapers within reach just in case there’s 
a last-minute explosion or leak while her diaper is off.
To minimize the risk of your baby falling from the bed or chang-
ing table while you change him, either keep a hand on him at all 
times or change him on a mat on the floor.
If you’re a gadget dad, you may want to check out baby wipe 
warmers. Often baby wipes can feel really cold to a baby, so these 
devices help to warm the wipes.
As we talk about in Chapter 5, your baby’s first poop is called 
meconium and it’s unforgettable — sticky, greenish-black, and 
tar-like. Your baby’s stools gradually change color as her diges-
tive system is cleaned out and she adjusts to her new food.
»
» Breastfed baby stools are runnier than meconium and an 
orange-yellow color. Breastfed stool has a sweetish odor.
»
» Formula-fed baby stools are firmer and a green-mustard 
color. Formula stools have a stronger, less agreeable odor.
If you’re reading this before you’ve had your baby, it may seem 
very odd to be talking about the color and consistency of baby 
poop. However, you’ll probably find stool discussions become part 
of your new social chitchat with your partner and other parents.
To help prevent diaper rash, give your baby some pants-free time 
each day if you can. Leave the diaper off so the skin can be exposed 
to the air and light. Use a diaper cream when she has a diaper on 
to protect her skin. See the section about creams in Chapter 4 for 
more information.

120      PART 2  The First Year
Bathing
Babies don’t need baths every day, but a cleaning of the face and 
neck where dribbled and regurgitated milk can collect is a good 
idea on the days you don’t give a bath. Wash around her bot-
tom with every diaper change to prevent diaper rash. Some babies 
don’t like to be naked for long; others love being in the water.
For babies who aren’t fond of a bath yet, sponge baths are an 
option. Simply wipe him off with a soft, damp cloth, emphasizing 
his face, neck, hands, and bottom.
ELIMINATION COMMUNICATION
The practice of elimination communication (EC), also known as infant 
potty training or natural infant hygiene, means dispensing with dia-
pers and reading your baby’s cues to tell you when he needs to relieve 
himself. You simply learn when junior needs to go and pop him on 
the potty. Using sounds like “ssss” and getting him used to specific 
places where he can “go potty” can also act as a cue that triggers your 
child to relieve himself.
Those who practice EC say it empowers children by letting them take 
charge of their own toilet training, encourages a stronger bond 
between parent and child as you learn to understand your child’s 
needs and cues better, and makes your baby feel more secure 
because she knows you’ll take care of her when she needs you to.
Practicing EC doesn’t mean you have to go the whole hog and be 
­diaper-free completely — many parents try EC only when they’re out-
doors, or only during the day. Others encourage potty use at set times 
of the day, such as right after waking up, or before or after a bath. If 
you’re interested in giving EC a try, take your time and see what works 
for you. Being watchful and conscious of your child’s cues is the first 
place you’ll need to start. Be prepared with a potty and some old cloth 
nappies to take care of accidents.
Take a look at http://ecsimplified.com/ or www.diaperfree 
baby.org/ for more information.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      121
Holding your newborn securely at all times when you’re bathing 
him is important — you’ll both feel more secure that way. The 
best way is to hold him around the shoulders so that your fore-
arm is supporting his head and your hand is holding the shoulder 
farthest away from you. Hold on tight — he can be a wriggly little 
monster even at this young age.
Here are some tips for bathing your little one:
»
» Check the temperature of the bath with your elbow. The 
water should be lukewarm; that is, if the water feels hot, it’s 
too hot, and if it feels cold, it’s too cold. You can also check 
the temperature with a bath thermometer; aim for a 
temperature just above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. You can 
buy little plastic toys that hold thermometers to monitor the 
bath temperature.
»
» Ensure the room temperature is quite warm. Your baby is 
naked and wet, so she can feel quite cold even when you feel 
perfectly fine in your clothes, especially when her head is wet 
for extended periods (try washing the head last).

» Collect everything you need before you start — a washcloth; 
a towel; and soap, shampoo, or body wash made for babies.
»
» Gunk can collect in all those rolls he’s sporting on his legs and 
arms, so give them a wipe. The same goes for his hands, so 
uncurl his little fists to wipe his palms. Pay particular atten-
tion to the neck. Spilled milk rolls down the neck and can 
sneak into that chubby triple chin he’s got at the moment.
»
» Wash his face, hair, and neck where milk often collects with a 
soft cloth.
»
» When cleaning baby girls’ bottoms, wipe from front to back. 
You don’t need to pull back your little boy’s foreskin to wash 
underneath either, if he’s not circumcised. If he’s circum-
cised, the tip of the penis may look a little raw at first or turn 
yellowish as it heals. Call your healthcare provider if anything 
about it freaks you out.
»
» When wiping junior’s face, wipe his eyes from inner to outer 
corners using cooled boiled water and cotton wool. This 
helps prevent an eye infection. If he has a sticky eye, as is 

122      PART 2  The First Year
common in the first weeks after birth, you can also use 
cooled boiled water and gently wipe his eyes from inner to 
outer. You may want to do this before giving him a full bath, 
while he’s still got his clothes on. Don’t expect him to like this 
or cooperate — a second pair of hands to hold his head still 
may be helpful.
Take a cordless phone or cellphone with you when you bathe your 
baby. You can never leave a baby unattended in the bath (he can 
drown in a few inches of water). Sometimes you may find you’ve 
forgotten something or need help. A phone is really handy if your 
partner or another person is elsewhere in the house — you can 
call her!
Your baby sports a little stump of umbilical cord for about five to 
ten days after birth. The stump is kind of shriveled and not that 
appealing to look at, but it needs to be kept dry and clean to pre-
vent infection. All you have to do is wash it with cotton swabs or 
balls and warm water when bathing baby or changing her diaper, 
and pat it dry. Your healthcare provider should give you instruc-
tions on care. Fold down the front of her diaper to prevent the 
diaper from rubbing against the cord and irritating it. Some new-
born diapers have a cutout area specifically for this purpose. If in 
doubt about the cord, call your midwife or doctor.
Dressing
Newborns aren’t big fans of getting dressed and undressed, so 
keep clothing simple. Having a pile of sleep suits with snaps or a 
zipper down the front is perfect for these early days when baby is 
in and out of bed or having his diaper changed a lot during the day.
In general, your baby should be wearing one more layer than you. 
If you’re not sure how hot or cold your baby is, put a finger down 
the back of his neck. He should feel warm rather than too hot or 
cold. Newborns often have cooler hands and feet, which is why 
sleepers with feet are nice to have.
If your newborn seems irritated by something, it can be as simple as 
a scratchy label rubbing her neck or a thread wrapping itself round 
her toe. It may be a good idea to cut off labels, especially if they 
feel rough or scratchy. Fortunately, many manufacturers now print 
information on the material itself, eliminating tags altogether.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      123
Feeding . . . and feeding . . .  
and feeding
Feeding your baby to help her grow and be healthy is an absolute 
given. But how do you feed her and when?
Breast or formula?
The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding as the 
best way to provide nutrition for a baby. Breast milk is the ideal 
food for your baby for the first six months of her life, providing 
targeted nutrition for her age and boosting her immunity. Breast 
milk is always at the right temperature and generally readily 
available. Breastfeeding encourages bonding between mother and 
baby, and last but not least, breast milk is free.
However, this isn’t an ideal world, and sometimes the situation 
just doesn’t allow breastfeeding to work. Breastfeeding may not 
work for your family for many reasons. That’s okay — there’s an 
alternative to breastfeeding. Formula is a milk substitute — babies 
under one year should never have actual cow’s milk — with added 
vitamins and nutrients to support growth and development, and 
plenty of babies thrive on it.
Whatever you and your partner decide to feed your baby, there 
are pros to both breastfeeding and formula. In some cases, both 
breast milk and formula can be fed to your baby, which means 
dads get more time in the feeding seat. Breastfeeding moms can 
also express milk using a breast pump, which means you can help 
with the feeding even if there’s not a can of formula to be seen.
As a dad, you can get out your advocating shoes again and sup-
port your partner in whichever method of feeding she prefers. If 
your partner has given breastfeeding her best shot but it hasn’t 
worked out, it can be tough emotionally for her. Your partner may 
feel like a failure, or less like a “real” mother to her child. She 
may be sensitive to the opinions of others around her, family and 
health professionals included, who don’t understand the decision. 
Don’t worry about the opinions of others; you don’t have to justify 
yourself to anyone. Be confident that you’re doing the best for 
your family.

124      PART 2  The First Year
Before deciding what and how to feed your baby, get as much 
information as you can so you’re fully informed of the choices and 
their implications.
Bottle feeding
If you’re bottle feeding, you need the following gear:
»
» Bottles and nipples: There are numerous baby feeding 
“systems,” so check them all out before buying the first one 
you see.
»
» A way to clean the bottles and nipples: A bottle brush 
works to get inside the bottle. You don’t have to sterilize 
bottles anymore.
Formula should be made up right before a feeding according to 
the instructions on the can or container. Have a supply of bot-
tles and nipples ready to go for when your baby’s hungry, to save 
time — and your eardrums.
Even if your partner’s breastfeeding, getting the bottle feed-
ing equipment anyway is a good idea. Your partner may want 
to express breast milk, in which case you’ll need the equipment 
listed for bottle feeding.
Feeding your baby is about creating a nurturing relationship 
between you and your child, as well as food. Your baby is held 
close when being breastfed, and the same should go for bottle 
feeding too. You can hold your baby in the same loving way as 
if she were breastfed, sing to her, or have a little chat while she 
feeds. You’ll find she gazes up at you adoringly and checks out 
every little nook of your face.
Never, ever prop a baby bottle. Your baby could choke and aspirate 
formula, causing a potentially life-threatening situation.
How much and when?
Newborn babies love to eat. They grow rapidly and their stomachs 
are small, so they need regular feedings to keep them tanked up. 
Having regular feedings also encourages milk production. If your 

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      125
partner is breastfeeding, her milk supply adjusts to meet baby’s 
demand.
Your baby tells you when she is hungry by
»
» Opening her mouth and thrusting her head to the side, as if 
rooting around to find your partner’s breast.
»
» Sucking her fists or clothing.
»
» Crying, which is a late sign of hunger and means feed me 
now or else! Try not to let your baby get to this state before 
feeding her.
A good sign that you’re on the right track with feeding your baby 
is that he’s putting on about the right amount of weight for his 
age. Babies usually lose weight in the first two weeks after birth. 
After the first few weeks, baby usually gains around ½ pound per 
week. Don’t worry; this rate slows as they get older.
Newborns usually need to be fed every two to three hours, or 
about eight to ten times in a 24-hour period. You’ll know your 
baby is getting enough to eat because she’ll have at least six to 
eight wet diapers a day; her urine will be light yellow, not dark; 
and her stools will be soft. If you’re concerned, call your health-
care provider.
Burping it up
Bringing up a good hearty belch may come naturally to you, but 
for baby, whose digestive system is still immature, a bit of air 
caught in her tummy or gut needs help to come out or it can 
be very painful. Usually a gentle pat on the back or a gentle rub 
counterclockwise does the trick. Your demure little princess will 
come out with a burp to make you proud.
You can use three good positions to burp your baby (see Figure 6-2):
»
» On your lap with baby facing down
»
» Sitting on your thigh facing out
»
» Over the shoulder, with baby’s head held upright on your 
shoulder

126      PART 2  The First Year
Don’t forget to support baby’s wobbly head. To protect yourself 
against any spit-up, drape a flat cloth diaper or receiving blanket 
over your shoulder or lap.

FIGURE 6-2: Three good positions for burping your baby.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      127
Your healthcare provider may suggest trying drops that help 
reduce gas production and discomfort. Babies that cry more also 
suck down more air, which distends the abdomen and causes dis-
comfort. A baby who spits up frequently or writhes and cries after 
a feeding may be suffering from reflux, a painful sensation caused 
by the regurgitation of gastric acid. See Chapter 7 for more infor-
mation about reflux.
Sleeping — you and the baby
Newborns wake regularly in the night and day for food, so getting 
a good eight-hour stretch of sleep is unlikely at this stage. As he 
gets older, your baby will sleep for longer chunks at night and will 
stay awake longer during the day.
Your baby tells you he’s tired by
»
» Fussing or whining
»
» Jerky, tense movements
»
» Rubbing his eyes
»
» Staring into space or turning away
»
» Yawning
Crying is a late sign of tiredness and may mean your baby is over-
tired. When baby is overtired, he may be more difficult to settle as 
he’s wound up about being tired.
IT’S ALL A MATTER OF STYLE
When you feed your baby can be just as controversial as what you 
feed your baby. Most healthcare providers today advocate demand 
feeding, which is letting the baby determine when she is fed rather 
than feeding her according to a schedule. If at all possible, demand 
feeding is best for your baby and gives her a sense of security that her 
needs will be met.

128      PART 2  The First Year
Teaching your baby about  
night and day
Babies don’t have a sense of day and night when they’re born, 
so part of your role as dad is to teach them the difference. Babies 
usually follow a cycle of sleeping, feeding, burping, changing, 
playing, and sleeping again during the day, but you can leave out 
the playing at night. Where you are animated and chatty in the 
day, you are all business at night, keeping baby’s room dimly lit 
for feedings and diaper changes, and putting him straight back to 
bed when you’re done. Changing your baby into day clothes dur-
ing the day can help signal that night is over.
Having a bedtime routine can help signal that night is on the way 
and that’s the time for sleeping (see Chapter 8).
Settling your baby
There are as many approaches to getting baby to sleep as there 
are children! How you get your baby to sleep is perhaps the most 
controversial topic. Strategies range from the cry-it-out approach 
where you put your baby down for a sleep in a bassinet or crib 
and let him cry until he falls asleep, to the attachment parent-
ing philosophy of keeping baby in close contact with a parent in 
a sling or pouch to sleep and having him sleep in a bed attached 
to yours at night.
Other parents use a technique called controlled crying, where baby 
is left to cry for a short period of time, say a couple of minutes, 
before being soothed and comforted, then left for a slightly longer 
period. The length of time between visits is stretched out, and 
eventually baby goes to sleep.
Some parenting experts warn against rocking your baby to sleep 
or doing anything where she falls asleep as a result of parent 
intervention, as baby becomes dependent on that technique to 
sleep. Putting your baby down sleepy but awake and letting her 
fall asleep on her own teaches her good sleep habits.
The settling approach you and your partner use is up to you. 
Decide what approach works best for your family.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      129
Reach an agreement with your partner before deciding which tech-
nique, method, or routine to follow. Using different approaches 
tends not to work.
If you’re having severe trouble settling your baby for days or 
weeks on end, calling your healthcare provider, breastfeeding 
group, or other moms may be helpful. Your own mom may also 
have a thing or two to teach you, but remember to take what you 
like and leave the rest! This is your baby.
Swaddling
One technique for helping babies to sleep is swaddling, which 
involves wrapping a light blanket around the baby to keep him 
snug (see Figure  6-3). Swaddling also helps control the Moro 
reflex, which is when your little one seems to startle or jump out 
of his skin for no reason at all!
Illustration by Kathryn Born, MA
FIGURE 6-3: How to swaddle a baby.

130      PART 2  The First Year
Crying — you, your partner,  
and the baby
At some stage crying is bound to take place in your household. A 
healthy baby may cry for several hours a day (or more). Crying is 
your baby’s way of telling you he’s hungry, lonely, tired, gassy, 
too hot, or in need of a diaper change. Sometimes he cries for no 
apparent reason at all.
Trying to figure out what the problem is while your baby howls 
can be stressful. Sometimes you may find yourself wanting to 
stop the noise whatever way you can. Crying can make you feel 
angry and frustrated, and you may want to lash out physically.
If you feel the crying is getting to be too much for you, put your 
baby in a safe place like her bassinet or crib, and then take a few 
minutes to calm yourself outside. A very short but demanding 
exercise can help get rid of some excess adrenalin as well, so “get 
down and give me 20” to work things out.
Whenever your baby starts crying, get into the habit of checking 
three things: Is he hungry, does he have a dirty diaper, and is he 
comfortable and well (does he have a high temperature, are there 
any signs of vomit, and are there any other obvious signs of a 
health problem)?
After you’ve checked your baby, do one (or all) of the following to 
try to calm and comfort your baby:
»
» Burp him to help him get rid of gas (if he’s just had a 
feeding).
»
» Cuddle and sing to him in a calm, soothing voice or put on a 
CD of gentle lullabies.
»
» Give him a warm bath.
»
» Put him down for a nap; he may just be tired (no kidding).
»
» Put your baby in the car and go for a drive around the block 
(not the most environmentally friendly alternative, but 
sometimes driving’s the one thing that works).

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      131
»
» Switch on a household appliance that makes a monotonous 
sound, such as a hairdryer, vacuum cleaner, or washing 
machine. Or download some “white noise” sounds from the 
Internet and play the noise to your baby.
»
» Take him for a walk in the stroller or baby carrier (at any time 
of the day or night).
»
» Try a gentle, soothing massage (see Chapter 7 for tips on 
baby massage).
Daddy time
Spending time with your baby doesn’t have to be all work and no 
play. Every diaper change is an opportunity to have some fun with 
your little one.
Besides the usual chores and jobs you do with your baby, you can 
hang out together in other ways that are just good old-fashioned 
fun. Try these out for size:
»
» Bathe or shower together. Bathing can be a little nerve-
wracking at first. Make sure mom is standing by with a towel 
when you’re ready to get out. Hold the soap — you don’t 
want things to get slippery!
»
» Enjoy some tummy time. Tummy time is where your baby 
lies on the floor on her stomach and tries to lift her head, 
which helps develop junior’s core strength. Read more about 
tummy time in Chapter 8.
»
» Have a chat. Babies coo from a few weeks old and delight in 
having their sounds repeated back to them.
»
» Read to your baby. It’s never too early to turn him on to 
reading. He’ll delight in the experience of being near you and 
seeing magical shapes and colors in the pictures.
»
» Sing to your baby. You can sing a ton of good songs with 
your baby, but you can always make up your own. And baby 
doesn’t care if you can’t hold a tune. He’ll just adore you 
more for it.

132      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Take a trip to the park. Your champ’s a little too young for 
slides and jungle gyms, but he’ll love sitting on your lap with 
you on the swing for a gentle swing back and forth. He’ll also 
love being outside and around other children.
Juggling Your Other Priorities
Before your baby came along, you were a partner, a son, a brother, 
a friend, an employee or boss, and a member of your extended 
family. Now that baby has arrived and your priorities have 
changed, fitting in all those aspects of your life can be a struggle. 
Not only can you jeopardize the relationships you have with peo-
ple in your life by letting fatherhood take over everything, but you 
can also lose your relationship with yourself and find your own 
well-being at risk.
Making time for yourself
You don’t stop being the person you were before baby came 
along. You still need to take care of yourself so you can be the best 
father — and partner and so on — you can be for a long time. 
Just as moms need time to themselves, dads deserve some time 
off too. Having a chat with your partner about continuing to fit in 
activities you enjoy or time with friends is important.
Making time for yourself may make you feel a little guilty and can 
be tricky to manage, but you need to take care of yourself before 
you can take care of anyone else.
Looking after your partner
There is a tendency for childcare organizations to hammer the 
message “baby comes first,” which is of course important. How-
ever, taking care of the baby can’t be at the constant expense of 
your relationship. After all, if your relationship goes down the 
drain, there’s a lot more trouble ahead.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      133
If you’re the primary caregiver, you know what it means to look 
after a baby all day and sort out the household at the same time. 
Being the primary caregiver is a lot of hard work, so get your part-
ner to help out when she gets home. If you’re the main provider, 
make sure you chip in and do whatever needs to be done when you 
get home. Yes, working all day and then helping out at home with 
looking after the baby is tough, but you’ll get through it. Looking 
after a baby and child does get easier over time — promise!
Above all, you and your partner need to have “us” time and spend 
quality time together. You can do this by getting friends or fam-
ily to look after the baby for a few hours while you go out, or 
even making a big deal out of a special occasion and celebrating at 
home when baby is asleep.
Here are some more ideas to keep your relationship alive and 
kicking:
»
» Invite some friends (especially those you are both friends 
with) over to cook dinner for you. Yes, inviting people to cook 
you a meal is pretty gutsy, but most people are only too 
willing to help out. This way you two get to see your friends, 
have a classy meal, and don’t have to do any work!
»
» Surprise each other with little gestures like leaving messages, 
buying a little treat or present, or getting out a DVD.
»
» Take a walk together with baby asleep in the stroller. That 
way the two of you can get some gentle exercise and spend 
time together.
Connecting with family
Your newborn isn’t just your pride and joy, but the pride and joy 
of your entire extended family. There is nothing like having a 
child to help you realize what your own parents went through 
when you were a kid. They will undoubtedly want to be part of 
your new child’s life. So share the love!

134      PART 2  The First Year
Having a lot of interaction with his grandparents, cousins, and 
other close relatives is invaluable for your baby — the more love 
coming at him, the better. Having your baby feel comfortable and 
safe with family members also means having a lot of babysitters 
on hand and extra pairs of hands when you or your partner are 
finding things tough. It also helps your baby develop his social 
skills and builds confidence.
DEALING WITH VISITORS
They say it takes a village to bring up a child. When your baby has 
arrived, you may realize that at least half of that village wants to drop 
in to check out the new addition to your family. Apart from your 
immediate family, expect to see neighbors you didn’t know you had, 
uncles and aunts you haven’t seen since you were a kid, old col-
leagues, acquaintances, and of course all your and your partner’s 
friends. Although you may want to show off your greatest creation, 
the demands of looking after a newborn (the sleep deprivation, the 
unfolded washing, the plates that are piling up everywhere) and your 
own anxiety about parenting don’t make a great mix for entertaining. 
But you can turn a horde of visitors into an army of helpers:
•	 Don’t serve tea or coffee when visitors come over. Point them to 
the kettle, or the vacuum cleaner, or the washing machine.
•	 If someone calls and says she’s coming over, get her to pick up any 
supplies you’re too busy or exhausted to get from the supermar-
ket yourself.
•	 People love to help and contribute in any way they can, so make 
the most of offers.
•	 Put up a sign on your front door with something like “Parents and 
baby sleeping, please call to let us know when you’re coming over.” 
Screen calls — that’s what answering machines and voicemail 
are for.
•	 Don’t be afraid to say no when you just don’t feel like having 
people over. People are generally quite understanding, especially 
if they have children themselves.

CHAPTER 6  Being Dad to a Newborn      135
Managing the work–life balance
Managing your commitments at work and your life outside paid 
employment is often a tricky one in this fast-paced society. Tech-
nology that allows you to work and be contactable 24 hours a day 
doesn’t help you separate work from leisure time. Even before 
becoming a father, finding time to do the things you love may 
have been a stretch. Now that you have the extra demands of a 
family, it may be time to readdress your work–life balance and 
take some steps so you don’t burn out.
Flextime, or working more flexible hours, is becoming more 
accepted, especially for men. In some workplaces, you may be 
able to design your own hours, bank up hours worked to take days 
off in lieu, or add a no-overtime clause to your contract. While 
not all companies in the United States are mandated to provide it, 
your company may offer time off through either paternity leave 
or through the Family Medical Leave Act, or FMLA. Ask your HR 
person about your company’s benefits.
Re-entering the wonderful  
world of sex
Having a little nooky is probably the last thing on mom’s mind 
for a few weeks after birth, and this can be rough on a new dad. 
The lack of lovin’ isn’t because you smell bad or have suddenly 
become repulsive. Blame it on the hormones, lack of sleep, leaky 
breasts, and the time it takes to recover from birth.
Women who’ve had a rough labor and some kind of intervention 
like a cesarean birth or vacuum or forceps delivery should wait 
longer and may not want to resume intimate activities any earlier 
than 8 to 12 weeks. A tear or an episiotomy (see Chapter 5) can 
take six weeks or more to heal. On top of that, your partner may 
not feel very sexy, having been through the birth and seen the 
look on your face as baby’s head emerged. Your partner may feel 
self-conscious about her postpartum body.
There’s also the mental attitude required for having sex. The 
memory of what birth felt like may last longer than the stitches, 
making the idea of sex unappealing.

136      PART 2  The First Year
You need to be a bit patient. Take cold showers and do plenty of 
exercise if need be. Most doctors recommend waiting at least six 
weeks after birth before having sex. That’s the length of time it 
takes for the uterus to get back to pre-baby size after a vaginal 
birth.
But things get better. Your partner is really just taking time to 
heal, get her head around things, and regain some of her mojo. 
It may take a few months, but her appetite for sex will return. In 
the meantime, continue to support and love her, and show inti-
mate affection for her in other ways with massages, foot rubs, 
and cuddles.
When you’re both ready to resume sex again, take it slowly. Let 
your partner control the pace and position, so things are com-
fortable for her. And don’t forget contraception. It’s a myth that 
breastfeeding stops another pregnancy — are you really ready for 
#2 yet?

ou’ve made it through the birth, know which end of your 
baby the diaper goes on, and have an idea or two about how 
things are shaping up in your new family. Now you’re 
really into the business end of fathering.
The first three months are possibly the most challenging in your 
new role as dad, as you come to grips with a vulnerable new life 
who is slowly learning more about her world and learning that 
you are there for her all the way.
In this chapter we deal with chores that need to be done to main-
tain your baby’s health and hygiene, and tackle some problems 
that you may be facing, such as colic and reflux. We explore your 
baby’s rapid development and how you can make the most of 
these important early learning stages. We also revisit postpar-
tum depression and who you can turn to for help, and show you 
how to make your home a safe environment for your soon-to-be- 
curious, mobile baby.

138      PART 2  The First Year
Getting to Know Your Baby
There’s no substitute for spending time with your baby and get-
ting up close and personal. Babies are funny creatures and grow 
faster than you expect. They are kind of blobby one day, and all 
cute and big-eyed the next. You’ll be stunned at how much they 
change in the first three months.
Your baby is unique in hundreds of ways, such as the way he yawns, 
the way he coos at the radio, and the way his hair sticks up like an 
orangutan’s. These are all special things that will probably disap-
pear as he grows up, so make time to absorb them while you can.
Everything in your baby’s life is new, and she doesn’t have the 
experience to interpret situations or sensations. Watching your 
baby feel sand under her feet or see a dog for the first time can 
be hilarious. Things that we take for granted are totally new and 
bizarre to your little one. Spending time with your baby is a great 
way to rediscover the world and sometimes can lift your spirits 
when you’ve had a rough day.
When your baby was born, you probably didn’t know which way 
to hold him up. Now you know which way he likes being burped, 
his favorite toys, the best times of day to go out and about, what 
songs he responds to, and the best methods for settling him at 
night. If you don’t feel you’re getting any more of a grip on this 
fatherhood thing and still can’t get him to sleep or bring up gas, 
don’t worry.
Good things take time and babies are quite random. Sometimes 
what works one day won’t work the next. All you need is a bit of 
determination to stick with it. Don’t give up being an involved 
father if you haven’t had the amazing experiences we describe 
in this book. Your baby hugely benefits from every moment you 
spend with her, whether you feel you are making progress with 
her or not.
Keeping things flexible
Doing the same thing day in and day out is boring for adults, but 
babies love routine. If you haven’t established some sort of routine 

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      139
or rhythm to your day with baby, establishing a routine soon is a 
good idea. We highly recommend having some sort of structure to 
your day so you and your little one know what’s coming.
A pattern of sleeping, feeding, changing, having some playtime or 
awake time, and then back to sleep is pretty standard. You don’t 
have to run things on a clock if you don’t want to, but some peo-
ple love that rigidity. As he approaches his three-month birthday, 
your baby can stay awake for about one and a half hours before 
getting tired and needing a nap (again, every baby is different so 
we are simply going by averages here).
Here are some thoughts about routines and how they may work 
for you:
»
» Anticipate how long you have out and about before baby 
gets tired and cranky.
»
» Arrange visits from friends and family around your schedule, 
not theirs.
»
» Organize your day around your baby’s naps, including 
getting some sleep while she does.
»
» Schedule time away from the baby each day, or time 
together as a family.
»
» Work out when to do those pesky chores, like laundry, 
cooking, and going to the doctor for baby’s checkups, around 
when you think baby will be awake, asleep, or need a 
feeding, keeping in mind that your ideas and your baby’s 
may differ considerably.
Even if your baby is on a strict schedule and seems to have settled 
into his timetable well, try to take each day as it comes. Babies 
love to keep things interesting by filling their diaper as you step 
out the door, spitting up just as you’ve got them into a smart 
new outfit, or demanding an early dinner when you’re out with-
out mom or a bottle to give them. Try not to see the world fall-
ing down around your feet if she doesn’t conform to your idea of 
what she should be doing. Take a deep breath and get used to life 
on baby’s time. Things will settle down again into a new routine 
soon.

Dealing with everyday disasters
You’re not alone in thinking that babies are a bit mysterious. 
They can’t talk, so if there’s something wrong, they can’t tell you 
straight out what’s going on. They have different, unfathomably 
fragile bodies compared to an adult’s body and are sensitive to 
things adults wouldn’t even notice, so babies suffer from “prob-
lems” different from adults. By taking time to get to know your 
baby, you get more of an idea about what makes him tick. You 
may even have solved the mystery of what kinds of cries your 
baby makes to communicate with you. Trial and error is often the 
only way to work out what’s going on with your baby or what to 
do to achieve a particular outcome.
Here are some suggestions for dealing with common problems 
experienced by babies (and parents) during the first few months 
of your baby’s life.
Clearing up jaundice
A common condition in newborns, jaundice refers to the yellow 
color of the skin and whites of the eyes. Jaundice clears natu-
rally in around one to two weeks. If the jaundice continues for 
any longer, your physician may recommend phototherapy, which 
is treatment with a special light that helps rid the body of biliru-
bin, a byproduct of broken down red blood cells and the cause of 
jaundice, by altering the bilirubin and making it easier for your 
baby’s liver to get rid of it.
Fluid helps wash the broken down red blood cells. Breastfed babies 
are more likely to experience jaundice because it takes a few days 
for breast milk to really come in.
Passing gas
Your baby lets you know he has gas by wriggling after a feeding or 
arching his back. He may get upset and cry too. See the three main 
burping positions in Chapter 6 to help him get rid of gas; if this 
doesn’t work, ask your doctor about giving your baby simethicone 
drops that help break up the gas bubbles, making them easier to 
bring up.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      141
Coping with colic
Doctors often disagree about what causes infantile colic or which 
parts of the body are affected. Some doctors say colic is caused 
by trapped gas; others say a nerve condition is to blame. You will 
know if your baby suffers from colic. Your little one usually gets 
pretty cranky in the evening, crying inconsolably for around three 
hours. Colic generally starts at a few weeks of age and typically 
disappears when your baby is three or four months old.
There is no magic cure for colic, we’re sorry to say, but you can try 
various tricks to distract your baby so she falls asleep. Movement 
sometimes helps a colicky baby settle down.
Some babies seem to be comforted by being held tummy down 
on laps or forearms. Colic doesn’t seem to have any long-lasting 
effects on the baby, but hearing their baby scream night after 
night can be terribly traumatic for parents.
If the crying is getting to be too much for you, put baby in a safe 
place like her crib or bassinet and take a breather. Take turns 
­getting out of the house, and if you’re really afraid the baby’s 
crying might push you over the edge, speak to your doctor about 
medications — for both of you — that could help you through a 
rough time.
Surviving colic is really hard on parents, but the love and patience 
you show during this time won’t be forgotten by your little one. 
Hang in there. Seek help from your healthcare provider if you 
think there could be some other problem.
Getting rid of cradle cap
Cradle cap is a kind of baby dandruff, a condition in which flakes 
appear on the scalp. Cradle cap’s not harmful and won’t cause 
your little one any distress. You can get rid of cradle cap by mas-
saging the scalp with almond oil or olive oil and rinsing with 
water. Cradle cap can sometimes become dark or crusty, or spread 
to the face, in which case you should talk to your healthcare pro-
vider about more treatment options.

142      PART 2  The First Year
Dealing with reflux
The valve where your baby’s esophagus and stomach meet should 
close to keep food and stomach acids inside. In babies with reflux, 
this valve doesn’t close properly yet. Most feedings end with your 
baby’s milk and stomach acids coming back up again, either by 
being vomited up or catching in his throat and hurting him. Nearly 
all babies experience some spitting in their first three months, 
before the valve closes tightly.
Your baby may have reflux if he
»
» Has sour-smelling breath.
»
» Has a wet sound in his throat, or has wet-sounding hiccups. 
This is caused by regurgitated milk in his throat.
»
» Writhes, arches his back, vomits, and cries after feedings.
Parents of babies who suffer from reflux worry about whether their 
baby is getting enough to eat or suffering a lot of pain from the 
reflux. Here are some ways you can minimize reflux symptoms:
»
» Avoid bouncing your baby, especially after meals.
»
» Change your baby’s diaper by rolling her to the side rather 
than lifting her legs higher than her head.
»
» Feed your baby in an upright position to help the milk stay 
down.
»
» Give your baby a pacifier to suck. Sucking a pacifier can help 
him swallow and clear the milk from the esophagus.
»
» If using formula, try one of the anti-reflux varieties on the 
market. Talk to your doctor before trying anti-reflux formula.
»
» Keep baby upright as much as you can to help gravity keep 
the milk and stomach acids in her stomach where they 
should be after meals.
»
» Put baby in a baby chair at an angle rather than placing her 
flat on the floor under a play gym when she’s awake.
»
» Raise the mattress in baby’s bed so her head is slightly 
higher than her stomach and the mattress is on a slight 

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      143
angle. Don’t raise the mattress too much or she will slide 
down the bed, which could be dangerous.
Reflux can be the result of an allergy to cow’s milk protein. In 
some instances having mom change to a dairy-free diet if she’s 
breastfeeding, or switching to a non-dairy formula such as goat 
or soy, may help. Speak to a medical professional or a dietician 
first.
Treatments for reflux include thickeners that hold milk down, 
such as infant Gaviscon. Medication may be prescribed if your 
baby’s case is particularly severe and she isn’t putting on as much 
weight as recommended.
Your baby will remember the love and comfort you give her as she 
deals with reflux long after she’s forgotten how reflux felt.
See what the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
has to say about infant reflux at www.niddk.nih.gov/health- 
information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/ger-and- 
gerd-in-infants/Pages/overview.aspx.
Handling sneezes, coughs,  
and runny noses
Even though you’ve bundled up your little precious and protected 
him from everything you can think of, he’ll still fall prey to a 
common cold. Until he’s two, there’s not a lot you can do for a 
baby with a cold except give him infant pain relief (always check 
the right dosage for your little one’s age), extra feedings, and lots 
of cuddles. You can also try the following:
»
» Clear the mucus out of your little one’s nose with a bulb 
syringe made especially for infants. Squeeze the bulb, insert 
the tip gently into the end of each nostril, and release the 
bulb. Clean it very thoroughly after each use. Don’t overuse it 
or you could cause irritation that makes things worse.
»
» Keep up the feedings so he doesn’t get dehydrated. If he’s 
been sleeping through the night (which would be a miracle 
at this age), expect him to wake up more — top him off with 
more fluids when he does.

144      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Saltwater drops can help unblock her nose and sinuses. 
Dissolve some salt in warm water and apply up her nose, 
drop by drop, with an infant medication dropper.
»
» She may have to stop to breathe when feeding if her nose is 
blocked, so take your time and let her control how much she 
takes.
»
» Use a cool-mist humidifier to moisten the air, which can 
reduce baby’s congestion.
If your baby suddenly comes down with a fever, or your instincts 
tell you something more than a cold is going on, call your doc-
tor. If nothing else, a trip to your healthcare provider can rule out 
anything more serious and put your mind at ease. A temperature 
of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered a fever.
Clearing up infant acne
Some babies develop a pretty unfortunate pimply face in the first 
days and weeks after birth. The spots are caused by hormones from 
the mother and fade away once those hormones are out of your 
baby’s system. You can’t do anything to make them go away, but 
keep baby’s hands under wraps (for example, in mittens) to stop 
her from scratching the spots accidentally. A gentle wash of warm 
water will keep the spots from becoming infected. Pat dry afterward.
Preventing diaper rash
Diaper rash is a flat red area on your baby’s bottom or genital 
area caused by ammonia from urine and stool staying on his skin. 
Diaper rash is very uncomfortable, and you may meet some resis-
tance at diaper changing time if your baby has diaper rash.
The best cure for diaper rash is prevention, so make sure his bot-
tom is washed with warm water and a soft cloth every time you 
change his diaper. Gently pat everything dry and apply your diaper 
cream or powder before the diaper goes on. Give him some time 
each day without a diaper to expose his skin to the air and sunlight.
If your poor baby should come down with a case of diaper rash, a 
zinc-based cream can help heal the skin. Be vigilant about baby 
hygiene. Wash cloth diapers in hot water and dry them in the sun 
to kill any bacteria lurking in the fabric. Some babies react badly 

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      145
to disposable diapers, while others flare up at the sight of a cloth 
diaper, so be flexible and experiment with different products in 
your diaper routine until you figure out what works for your baby.
Diaper rash may flare up when your baby is teething, but not all 
babies experience this.
If diaper rash persists despite all your efforts, see your healthcare 
provider for more advice and treatment.
Teething
Most babies younger than three months old haven’t started 
teething, but some babies are eager to grow up and may have a 
few teeth bothering them. Some babies are even born with a few 
gnashers!
See Chapter 9 for tips on helping baby deal with teething.
Treating skin irritations and scratching
If your baby’s skin is dry or she’s scratching herself, soothe her 
skin with olive or sweet almond oil and put some mittens on her 
hands. You can get shirts and sleepers with fold-over ends that 
become mittens. Try not to use these too often; your baby needs 
to use her hands to explore her world.
Taking care of business
Like you, babies have growing nails and snotty noses, and get stuff 
in their ears and eyes. Babies need ongoing body maintenance. 
Funnily enough, that’s often when a frustrated mom hands over 
baby to dad. Just roll up your sleeves and do it. By the way, if, as 
part of your fatherhood journey, you haven’t been vomited on, 
had poop squirted on you, or been christened with pee yet, you’re 
not trying hard enough.
A compilation of jobs for real men includes the following:
»
» Administering medicine: After vaccinations or during an 
illness, your baby may need pain relievers or antibiotics. 
Medicines for babies are usually prescribed as a liquid 
suspension and are most easily given in a plastic syringe 

146      PART 2  The First Year
(no needle attached). Dosages are typically measured in 
milliliters (mL), and getting the dosage right is important. Get 
your healthcare provider to show you the correct dose when 
your baby’s given his vaccinations or he’s prescribed 
medicine.
»
» Cleaning ears: Earwax is a good thing because it protects 
the ear canal, so don’t get too worked up about it. Wiping the 
outer ear and neck area where milk can collect should do the 
trick, but be careful not to get water in the ear canal. If you’re 
concerned about the cleanliness of your baby’s ears, leave it 
to the professionals and see your doctor.
»
» Mopping up poop explosions: Every baby has at least one 
bowel motion that truly tests the limits of what you thought 
a small person could excrete. Babies also get the odd bout of 
diarrhea if they eat something that disagrees with them or if 
they catch a gastrointestinal bug. The result is the mother (or 
father) of all poops, also called the “backsider” as stool goes 
all the way up the diaper and into the sleeper. If your little 
one has a tummy bug or diarrhea, you can minimize the 
mess by doubling up on diapers. You may want to invest in 
an apron to protect your clothes at these times, even if you 
think it makes you look ridiculous.
»
» Trimming finger and toe nails. Get yourself one of those 
dinky little manicure sets for children, which include a pair of 
scissors with rounded ends, a tiny pair of nail clippers, and 
some emery boards. Approach your baby when she’s asleep 
or feeding so she’s not focused on having her fingers dealt 
with. The clippers are probably easiest to start with, but 
failing that, try special baby scissors. If you’ve done a pretty 
rough job, smooth off craggy nail edges with an emery board 
so she doesn’t scratch herself with them. This job is likely to 
get harder as your baby gets older, so get some early 
nail-cutting training in while she is still pretty helpless and 
can’t move about much.
»
» Wiping away sticky eye: Many babies have a buildup of 
mucus at their eye corners, and this can be easily removed 
by wetting a washcloth with lukewarm water and gently 
wiping away the mucus.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      147
Being a Real Hands-On Dad
The days of fathers coming home from work and disappearing 
behind the evening paper while mother tended to the baby are 
long gone. Twenty-first-century dads are rolling up their sleeves 
and are fully involved in all things baby, which doesn’t just include 
chores. In this section we explore ways to have fun with your new 
playmate and pick up new skills along the way.
Baby massage
We’re not talking about being pummeled by a masseuse, but a 
gentle rub with a light oil, much like a hairdresser shampooing 
your hair or giving you one of those funny head massages. Baby 
massage has lots of benefits, not least of all getting his skin nicely 
moisturized. Touch is the most developed sense in a newborn, and 
sensory receptors in his skin help him learn about his body. He’s 
not really aware of where his hands, feet, and tummy are yet.
Baby massage is a gentle way to express care and nurturing for 
your baby and is a time for you to engage and chat, or sing a song. 
Baby massage is total bliss for your little one and helps his devel-
opment tremendously. So if you can give your little guy a massage 
a day, that’s fantastic!
A good time to massage your baby is after his bath and before bed. 
He’ll be warm from the bath, and massage will further relax him 
for a good night’s sleep (fingers crossed).
Here’s how to massage your baby:
»
» Make sure the room you’re in is warm and that your hands 
are warm as well.
»
» Set up a flat, comfortable surface, like a changing table or 
firm mattress.
»
» Use a moisturizer made especially for baby, or an edible, 
unscented oil such as coconut or safflower oil. Some 
essential oils, diluted for infants, are also soothing for baby 
massage. Test a small amount on your baby’s skin to make 

148      PART 2  The First Year
sure his skin isn’t sensitive to it. Warm the oil in your hands 
before touching baby.
»
» Take your time. This isn’t a chore like washing diapers or 
getting dinner on the table. Use this time to connect and 
enjoy being with your baby.
»
» Talk to your baby or sing a song, but keep the tone of the 
massage calm, peaceful, and low key. You can also name the 
body parts you are massaging. Although speech develop-
ment is a while off, naming the body parts establishes vocal 
patterns your baby will recognize over time.
»
» You can roll baby over and rub her back. First, roll her onto 
her side, then put a hand under her torso and the other 
hand on the leg closest to you. Ease her onto her chest by 
removing your hand as she turns over.
»
» To massage feet, have baby on her front and use slow gentle 
circles on her tootsies.
»
» To massage legs and arms, hold baby’s foot or arm with one 
hand while massaging the limb in one long, gentle stroke 
with the other from the hand or foot and up.
Avoid massaging baby right after he’s eaten. Pressure on his belly 
may not agree with him.
Try to have one hand always touching your baby while massaging, 
even when reaching for more oil.
Baby activities
You can encourage brain development by playing with your baby. 
Try these activities:
»
» Laying him on his tummy. Also known as “tummy time,” a 
few minutes a couple of times a day on his tummy helps 
strengthen his back and neck muscles. On the floor you can 
do some visual activities like blowing bubbles or slowly 
moving a ball in front of his eyes. Place some objects such as 
toys just out of reach. He’ll try reaching them as he develops 
his physical skills.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      149
»
» Moving him around. Movement is good for getting those 
synapses or brain connections firing and linking with other 
parts of the brain. Try some gentle rocking, or have him lie 
on your lap facing you as you move your legs up and down. 
Or you can have baby on your shins while you lie on the 
floor. Hold his hands and lift your legs. He’ll love it.
»
» Reading to her. You can’t start the book habit too early. 
Picture books with clear, contrasting colors are a big hit.
»
» Talking to him — a lot. He can’t understand your words, 
but he’s listening and learning and picking up language 
faster than he ever will again. You don’t have to discuss 
Shakespeare or politics; just talk about what you’re doing or 
seeing.
Even a mundane task like changing a diaper is an opportunity 
to learn for your baby. Repeating phrases like “lying down” or 
“off comes your diaper” each time connects the words and action 
for your child. As his language skills develop, you may find him 
pointing to his diaper or lying down when you ask him to.
Keeping baby safe and sound
Your baby is pretty helpless physically and oblivious to danger. 
Keeping baby safe is up to you. The buck stops with the parents; 
nobody else keeps your baby safe for you. So keep up the good 
work by always
»
» Checking the temperature of formula by sprinkling a little on 
your wrist.
»
» Ensuring your baby’s breathing isn’t obstructed by objects 
such as blankets in the crib, crib toys, or bumpers. While all 
these things are cute, they’re also safety hazards in the crib 
with young infants.
»
» Maintaining a smoke-free home and car.
»
» Keeping a hand on her when she’s on elevated surfaces like 
a bed or changing table.
»
» Keeping your cups of tea, coffee, and other hot beverages 
well clear of the baby (see the nearby sidebar “Scalding”).

150      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Providing age-appropriate toys. Toys for older children have 
small parts that may break off and choke your little one.
»
» Supervising the baby when she’s in the bath, even if she’s 
using a bath support.
»
» Using an age-appropriate car seat for car trips.
Right now, he can’t move or prod his fingers into electrical sock-
ets, so you can get a head start and baby-proof your house now 
for when he’s on the move. A good place to start is to get down 
on your hands and knees for a baby’s-eye-view of the terrain and 
see what jumps out at you as potentially dangerous. Table  7-1 
­provides ways to help you rectify any trouble spots.
TABLE 7-1	 Baby-Proofing Room by Room
Room
What to Do
Living areas
Secure bookshelves and other unstable furniture like tall CD racks 
to the wall with anchors to prevent them from toppling on 
your baby.
Put childproof locks on china cabinet doors to prevent your 
sweetie getting into Grandma’s heirloom china.
Use a guard around your fireplace or heater. Teach your child to 
stay away by saying “hot” when he is near the heat source.
Tuck away cables or put cushions and furniture in front of them.
Hide any remote controls you don’t want baby to slobber on.
Put barriers across any stairs or steps.
Kitchen
Keep appliance cords from hanging over the counter or stove. 
Your baby could easily pull a kettle of hot water on herself.
Keep pot handles tucked in over the stove.
Use guards on your stove elements and around the top of your 
stove to prevent hot food spilling onto your child.
Erect a barrier across your kitchen’s doorway to prevent your child 
entering while you cook.
Forget using tablecloths with really small children — one tug and 
everything goes overboard.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      151
SCALDING
Did you know that an average-sized cup of tea or coffee can cover  
up to 70 percent of the skin surface of your baby? This means up to 
70 percent of the skin of your baby could be scalded if the liquid is 
accidentally spilled on the baby. Unfortunately, scalding is a common 
occurrence as any emergency room worker will tell you. So always 
place hot beverages on safe surfaces (not near the edge) and well 
away from the baby.
Room
What to Do
Keep cleaning products and detergents in a cupboard — 
preferably a high one — with a childproof lock.
Never store poisons in food containers. Junior can’t tell the 
difference between disinfectant and a bottle of juice.
Use a childproof lock to secure any cupboard or drawer that has 
precious china, knives, or equipment you don’t want becoming 
one of your baby’s favorite toys.
Laundry
If you use a diaper pail, make sure the lid is securely fitted and the 
pail is always stored out of baby’s reach.
Keep cleaning products and detergents in a cupboard — 
preferably a high one — with a childproof lock.
Make sure all buckets are left empty.
Bathroom
Make sure your hot water thermostat is set no higher than 120 
degrees Fahrenheit.
Keep all electrical appliances out of the bathroom to prevent 
accidental electrocution.
Consider getting a lock or keeping the lid down on your toilet to 
prevent anything, like your car keys, being deposited in the toilet.
Keep a lock on the medicine cabinet, and keep cleaners and 
detergents — even your shampoos — in a locked cupboard, 
preferably out of reach.
Outdoor areas
Make sure pools and balconies are fenced with childproof locks. 
Fences should have gaps of no more than 4 inches between 
pickets to prevent baby becoming trapped between them or 
falling through.

152      PART 2  The First Year
Understanding Your Baby’s 
Development
Watching your offspring transform from a curled ball of wrinkled, 
angry-looking baby into a wide-eyed, smiling bundle of delight 
is a joy. In the first three months of life, your baby changes so 
fast that you may have forgotten what he was like in those first 
days.
Growth and weight
Newborns typically lose up to ten percent of their body weight in 
the days immediately after birth, but they can put that back on 
in the following one to two weeks. Your healthcare provider will 
keep track of your baby’s weight and plot it on a growth chart, 
usually kept in your baby’s medical chart. Unless baby is not put-
ting on any weight, is distressed or lethargic, or seems under-
nourished, weight is not usually a cause for concern but is a useful 
way to track his growth.
Babies usually have growth spurts at around 6 and 12 weeks, 
when they wake more at night for feedings and take more food 
during the day.
During the first three months, your baby will
»
» Blow lots of dribbly bubbles.
»
» Coo — baby’s first form of non-crying verbal communication.
»
» Learn to lift her head without help — the result of all your 
tummy time endeavors.
»
» Reach out and try to bat objects in her vision.
»
» Smile. The first heart-melting smiles usually appear around 
six weeks.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      153
Hearing, sight, smell,  
taste, and touch
Your baby’s senses, just like the rest of his body, need time to 
develop. He learns by experiencing the world and interpreting 
what’s going on, using his senses to gather information. Here’s 
the lowdown on what your baby can sense already and what you 
can do to encourage further development of his senses.
Hearing
Your baby can hear before she’s born. Already she’s had months 
listening to mom’s stomach gurgle and the distant rumble of you 
talking to her. Your baby may settle to the sound of the vacuum 
cleaner or washing machine because those noises are like the 
white noise of being in the womb.
Your baby will respond to the high pitch of baby talk, which you’ll 
find yourself automatically using when you talk to him (some say 
we are genetically programmed to speak this way, so don’t worry 
about handing in your man card when you hear yourself talk like 
a girl). Your little one can’t understand English yet, but she can 
understand your tone and is soothed by soft, gentle sounds. She 
listens when you speak and even though your speech is gibberish 
to her, keep talking — it’s good for her language development.
If you live in a household where more than one language is 
spoken, your child is in for a treat. Not only do children with a 
multilingual upbringing perform better academically (across all 
subjects), but seeing a child master two or more languages with 
absolute ease is great. In some cases multilingual children come 
in very handy as translators between various parts of the family. 
So by all means, speak to your child in as many languages as you 
can. A baby can produce any sound of any language in the world. 
If she’s exposed to a particular language before she reaches about 
nine months, she’ll be able to speak it like a native tongue.
Your healthcare provider does a simple hearing test during the 
first few weeks. If for some reason this hasn’t happened, have 
your child’s hearing tested right away because hearing problems 
can be diagnosed early. As your child grows, hearing checks are 

154      PART 2  The First Year
important, because hearing loss can be caused through things like 
ear infections, trauma, and high noise levels.
Sight
The world is fuzzy for a newborn, whose eyes are only just figur-
ing out how to do their job. Your newborn sees best at a distance 
of 8 to 10 inches, which is a good distance to check you out when 
she’s in your arms. In the early weeks, she’ll gaze at contrasts 
like the folds in your curtains or car lights shining on a wall as it 
passes your house. She’ll look at something for a short time and 
then look away. Looking at something for a long time — apart 
from you and her mom — is hard work for newborns. You and 
your partner are your baby’s favorite sight.
In these early weeks, your baby learns how to focus both eyes and 
follow a moving object, and likes to look at contrasts rather than 
similarly colored objects.
You can help your little one’s vision by showing her a variety of 
brightly colored and contrasting images. Use one item at a time 
so she isn’t overloaded. A nice game to play is to move in and out 
of your baby’s focus range. She’ll smile when you come into focus 
and concentrate on your face.
The saying “out of sight, out of mind” is particularly true for 
babies up to the age of around four to nine months. If baby can’t 
see something, it doesn’t exist, which comes in handy when he 
wants something, such as a toy, but you need him to focus on 
something else. Hide the toy and you’re good. However, baby 
eventually works out that things continue to exist even when 
they’re not in sight. This signals the beginning of establishing a 
short-term memory. For example, if mom leaves the room, baby 
starts crying because he remembers his mom and she’s no longer 
there. This phenomenon is referred to as object permanence.
Smell and taste
Baby comes equipped with a pretty developed sense of smell and 
taste. He knows you by your smell as well as your voice and what 
you look like, and can recognize changes in the taste of breast 
milk or a different brand of formula. Baby can already taste salty, 

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      155
sweet, sour, and bitter flavors. When he’s introduced to solids in 
a few months, you’ll learn even the blandest foods can taste wild 
and exotic to a baby.
Touch
At birth, your baby’s sense of touch is fully developed and she 
loves to be in close contact with you as much as she can. Your 
baby’s favorite thing is to be cuddled or snuggled by you, and 
you can’t cuddle her too much. Your baby’s sensitivity is also why 
baby massage (covered earlier in this chapter) is such an effective 
tool in bonding, nurturing, and settling.
One of the first ways your infant discovers the world of touch 
is through his mouth. Even in these early weeks, he investigates 
rattles, blankets, his fingers, and all manner of objects by gum-
ming and gnawing them with his mouth.
The flipside of this incredible sensitivity is that babies can feel 
pain and are sensitive to scratchy clothing labels, temperature, 
and uncomfortable diapers, so if baby is upset, check to see 
whether she is uncomfortable or overheated because of her cloth-
ing. A baby’s skin is several times more sensitive than an adult’s 
skin, so an unintentionally firm grip can be quite painful. Rough 
and tumble dads — watch the pressure you apply.
Your baby’s amazing brain
By three months of age, your baby is almost unrecognizable from 
the helpless little bundle you first met at birth. As new connec-
tions, called synapses, form between different parts of her brain, 
she displays new skills and understands more of what’s going 
on around her. Synapses are formed very quickly in the first six 
months of life, but as the brain works out which are worth hanging 
onto, those synapses that aren’t used frequently are abandoned. 
Repetition of words, songs, sights, sensations, routines, move-
ments, sounds, and tastes helps your baby’s synapses develop and 
makes sure they’re retained.
Research shows that stimulation in these early months and years 
of your child’s life enhances brain development. Conversely, no 

156      PART 2  The First Year
stimulation leads to a loss of brain function. Researchers who 
study brain development found that brain development happens 
in patterns but not at the same pace. The researchers generally 
talk about “development windows” being open for a particular 
period. During this time your baby is particularly interested in 
developing a certain sense or skill, or grasping a concept. If you 
find your baby is particularly interested in something, such as 
rolling over, give him lots of opportunities to do more of it and 
ensure he can explore his interest safely.
Stimulating your baby’s brain is easy. Give him lots of safe oppor-
tunities to explore what he’s interested in and keep offering new 
experiences. See the earlier section “Baby activities” for ideas to 
get your baby’s brain abuzz with new information.
Babies learn new skills at different stages and ages, so don’t worry 
if your baby isn’t doing what everyone else’s baby in your coffee 
group is doing — he’ll get there. If you’re concerned, talk to your 
healthcare provider. There’s a big “nature versus nurture” debate 
about how and to what extent you can stimulate or influence your 
child’s development. Nobody knows how much influence nature 
(the genes your baby has inherited) and nurture (parental input 
and the learning environment) have. However, neither nature nor 
nurture is 100 percent responsible for your child’s development; 
they both have a certain degree of influence.
The next few months are about your baby discovering that he has 
a body. Newborns don’t recognize their limbs or body as their 
own. Hands are a particularly big part of your baby’s life in the 
coming months. Make sure any toys he has contact with are suit-
able for his age, because toys for older kids may have parts that 
can break off and become a choking risk. Toys with different tex-
tures and surfaces expose your baby to different sensations when 
he plays with the toys in his hands.
Between one and three months, your baby is probably
»
» Discovering her hands, perhaps sucking her thumb or 
fingers.
»
» Smiling in response to your smile.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      157
»
» Uncurling her fists to grasp a rattle. She probably won’t be 
able to look at the rattle, as she won’t connect what her 
hands and her eyes are doing yet and the rattle may be too 
close for her eyes to focus on.
Looking at Male and Female 
Postpartum Depression
Feeling “the blues” is one thing, being in a black hole is another. 
That’s how some people describe postpartum depression (PPD). 
The condition is associated with mothers for the most part, with 
an estimated 10–15 percent of mothers suffering from postpar-
tum depression. What’s less well known is that three to ten per-
cent of fathers can suffer from PPD too.
While many men report feeling left out of their partners’ lives as 
mothers deal with the constant needs of their babies and their 
own exhaustion, others feel overwhelmed by the demands of work 
and hectic situations at home. At worst, you may even have nega-
tive or guilty feelings about your baby and feel you’re a bad father 
or partner.
If everything’s becoming too much for you, take time out from 
your partner and baby, go into another room or leave the house 
for a bit, and let it all hang out. Scream in the room, house, or 
street if you want. This works wonders at releasing tension, and 
you’ll feel like a new dad. Doing a quick, high-energy exercise 
like push-ups to release excess adrenalin can also be really useful.
Listening to a baby crying is one of the most stressful things you 
can expose a human body to; it’s nature’s cunning way of making 
sure the offspring is well looked after and gets priority treatment. 
So don’t be surprised if the baby is stressing you out.
All your baby wants to do is please you. You are a rock star in 
his world; you’re the bee’s knees. When things are getting tough, 
you’re sleep deprived, damp diapers are hanging on the clothes 
rack, it’s 2 a.m., and baby won’t settle down, remember that your 
baby isn’t crying for the hell of it.

158      PART 2  The First Year
Recognizing the signs
Knowing about and recognizing some of the signs of PPD can 
assist you to seek help for yourself or someone else with PPD. 
Some of the signs of PPD to look for include
»
» Anxiety or panic attacks
»
» Feelings of hopelessness
»
» Frequent crying spells
»
» Loss of energy and appetite
»
» Loss of enjoyment in everyday activities and in your baby
»
» Loss of sex drive
»
» Mood swings
»
» Problems sleeping even when baby is settled
»
» Prolonged feelings of sadness and hopelessness, with 
nothing to look forward to
»
» Suicidal thoughts
Every case is different. If you feel you or your partner may have 
PPD, talk to each other about how you’re feeling and see your 
doctor.
Getting help
If your partner has PPD, supporting her may seem like a pretty 
impossible task, and you may feel out of your depth. You can help 
in lots of ways. Try some of these ideas:
»
» Arrange things so you can spend time together with your 
partner — alone. Regular “us” time helps de-stress both of 
you and helps you to find and share some common ground 
again.
»
» Let her talk while you listen, or involve a friend she feels 
comfortable talking to.

CHAPTER 7  The First Three Months      159
»
» Take over more of the housework and baby care, and try to 
let her get some sleep. If you can’t take on everything, call in 
some support like family and friends so you’re not swamped 
as well.
»
» Treat her in some way, like with a night at the movies, a 
massage voucher, a bunch of flowers, or a special gift.
»
» Make sure she’s following up with any therapies, doctor’s 
appointments, or medications needed.
Postpartum depression in men, though not as common as PPD in 
women, is just as serious. Admitting there’s a problem is difficult. 
You may find the following helpful:
»
» Talk to your doctor: He can offer you a range of options 
including counseling and medication.
»
» Talk to family and friends: This step can be a biggie, but 
you’re likely to be amazed at how anxious people are to help. 
Chances are some of your friends have gone through the 
same thing.
»
» Find support in your community: Many hospitals host 
groups dealing with postpartum depression. Online groups 
such as www.ppdsupportpage.com/ can also be a lifesaver.
»
» Get some exercise: Feeling fit and active can lift your mood. 
Around 30 minutes of daily activity is all you need to release 
mood-enhancing hormones.
Your doctor may know of local sources for PPD groups. Check the 
website www.postpartumprogress.com/ppd-support-groups-in- 
the-u-s-canada for a list of groups that meet in each state and in 
Canada. Also see Postpartum Depression For Dummies by Shoshana S. 
Bennett, PhD (published by Wiley).
Postpartum depression is temporary, and you can find a way 
through it. If you feel lost, take stock and get some help.

Looking after your growing baby
Getting on with your life
Leaving your baby with other people
Months Three 
to Six
C
ongratulations — you’ve survived the first three months! 
Remember those first days when you didn’t even know how 
to hold your precious new baby? By now, things in your 
household are probably settling down a bit, and the adrenalin 
rush (read “chaos”) of the first weeks is dropping away behind 
you. Your baby is spending longer periods awake and is engaging 
with you and her surroundings. So now you two can really get to 
know one another!
The next three months are also a period of great change develop-
mentally, as your “helpless” three-month-old, who can barely 
hold up her head, transforms into a six-month-old bundle of 
activity, capable of moving around, downing solid food, and using 
her hands for all sorts of things (some of which you don’t want 
her to do). Hey, she may even have a few teeth already!
In this chapter, you find out what you can do as a dad during the 
next three months to interact with your little person. You also 
get the scoop on any paperwork required for your baby, what you 
need to know before you can leave your baby with others, and 
doing things with your partner as a couple.

162      PART 2  The First Year
Watching Your Growing Baby
Your baby is changing — and fast. Commonly, at around three 
months, he undergoes a growth spurt, and if he’s been suffering 
from colic or other problems with digestion, these may mercifully 
start to subside over the next few months. Check out Chapter 6 for 
more information about burping a baby and Chapter 7 for more 
about digestive problems.
Baby’s new tricks
Over the next three months your baby will start to
»
» Clasp objects, bring his hands together, and reach for toys
»
» Develop stronger neck muscles and be able to hold his head 
up more steadily
»
» Gnaw on everything she can get her hands on
»
» Make babbling sounds
»
» Recognize familiar objects and people, and start to look  
for toys
»
» Roll over from her back to her front
»
» Sleep for longer stretches at night (in some cases)
»
» Smile (intentionally) and squeal
If your baby isn’t doing these things, don’t panic. All babies are 
unique and develop at their own pace. If you’re concerned with 
delayed milestones, talk to your healthcare provider.
New challenges for dads
After the first three crazy months, you and your partner are prob-
ably more confident parents and are getting your heads around 
how your new family works. But, as with every stage of being a 
great dad, you get a few more hurdles to jump.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      163
Handling postpartum depression
Postpartum depression (PPD), a form of clinical depression that 
can affect women and men following childbirth, doesn’t neces-
sarily disappear when your baby outgrows the newborn period. 
See Chapter 7 for lots of useful information about PPD.
Riding out the storm of your partner’s depression can be tough, 
so your patience, communication, and support are vital. She may 
be irritable — mad at you one minute for trying to do too many 
things with the baby, and then mad at you for not doing enough. 
Stay strong and make the effort to listen to her. Offer to take the 
baby off her hands for a while, even if she protests, and be patient. 
Encourage her to talk to you and others, or to find professional 
help from her healthcare provider. This is where you can really 
demonstrate that you’re super-star dad material.
Dealing with sleep deprivation
Even if your partner is breastfeeding and you’re not getting up 
at night, you may still wake up when she tends to the baby. So, 
broken sleep remains a given for dads in these early months when 
your baby is growing and feeding like an insatiable beast. If your 
partner is the main caregiver and you’re back at work, having to 
get up in the morning as well as spending eight hours with a new 
boss when you haven’t had a good night’s sleep can really get  
to you.
You need to do something about this situation (other than drink-
ing lots of coffee), so get organized. Take turns, sleep when the 
baby sleeps during the weekend, or sleep at a friend’s house for 
one night. Don’t forget to give your partner a break as well — 
things often start to look up after you get a decent night’s sleep.
To help you stay asleep when you really need your zzz’s, try using 
ear plugs (or headphones with white noise playing) to cancel out 
the baby’s crying.
Your baby waking in the night for feedings is a good thing — she 
needs fuel to grow. The trade-off is coping with the lack of sleep, 
which is temporary. Baby sleeps for longer during the night as 
she gets older.

164      PART 2  The First Year
Missing out when you’re at work
The first time your child rolls over, works out a toy, or takes some 
other momentous step toward independence is probably going to 
happen when you’re stuck at work.
Stay up to date with your little person’s development. Have your 
video camera or digital camera parked in the living room or baby’s 
room so your partner can capture a few minutes of your child’s 
day for you to watch when you get home. Even better — get a 
webcam going: They’re really easy to set up and operate these 
days.
New adventures for dads
Now that your baby is spending less time sleeping or napping, 
you, dad, get to have some fun with your wee one. Okay, you may 
have to wait a few more years until you can kick a ball around the 
backyard with junior, but you have plenty of things that you can 
do together right now.
Research shows that playing with your baby, even when he’s this 
size,
»
» Develops his social skills
»
» Enhances his relationship with you (and vice versa)
»
» Helps with hand–eye coordination
»
» Raises his self-esteem
»
» Stimulates his brain development
Best of all, playing with your baby is great fun!
Here are some ideas for spending time with your baby:
»
» Moving around: Movement helps your baby establish and 
grow connections between different parts of the brain. 
These connections are vital in fine-tuning your child’s senses, 
learning new physical skills, and developing the ability to 
think and reason.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      165
A good way to do simple movement is by rolling your baby 
over. Help junior roll over from his back to his front by laying 
him on his back and crossing one leg over the other so he 
slowly rolls onto his tummy. Ideally you would do this on the 
floor on top of a blanket so he can’t fall if he rolls suddenly. 
Make sure his head is supported if he’s still a bit unsteady.
»
» Singing: Okay, so everyone else holds his hands over his 
ears when you sing, but your baby won’t. With your baby in a 
bouncy or baby chair, she loves being sung to along with lots 
of touch. Songs like “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” “Itsy Bitsy 
Spider,” and “Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes” can delight 
your little one. Make corresponding movements when you 
sing; for example, touch her shoulders when you sing that 
word.
One thing you never have to worry about with all babies is 
your level of vocal talent — they enjoy any attempt at 
singing. Humming or whistling is also a great alternative if 
your singing voice really grates on everyone’s nerves.
»
» Stretching and growing: Blowing bubbles during tummy 
time helps your little one’s eyesight and gets him looking up, 
strengthening that neck. You can also place toys just out of 
his reach so he looks up or stretches his body trying to reach 
them.
»
» Taking tummy time: This activity is about laying your baby 
on her tummy so she can learn to push up and lift her head. 
This exercise is so important because it strengthens the 
muscles in your baby’s back, neck, legs, and arms in prepara-
tion for crawling and walking.
Some babies really don’t like tummy time (and can heartily 
let you know about it), so be prepared to be as entertaining 
as you possibly can be — lying on the floor next to her, if 
necessary — to keep her in this important position several 
times a day. Try lying down and having her on your tummy 
facing you, or raise her up on your shins as you hold her 
hands.
The best place for your baby (and you) to play and explore is the 
floor. Being low makes it very safe from falls, and floor contact 
teaches your baby about his body because he can feel a firm sur-
face at each touchpoint.

166      PART 2  The First Year
Adjusting to your baby’s  
changing needs
Looking after your baby is great fun — seems that every time you 
finally master a particular situation, he just moves on to the next 
challenge. Welcome to nature’s way of ensuring you’re not bored 
as a parent! Now that you’re through the first three months, 
keeping up with your baby’s development and adjusting your par-
enting skills accordingly is very important.
Looking a bit famished?
As your little one moves toward the six-month mark, you start 
to notice she’s chowing through the milk and starting to look for 
something a bit more substantial. Your baby may be ready to start 
eating solid food. Until now, breast milk or formula has sustained 
her, but now her digestive system is more developed, and her 
growth needs have a bit more oomph.
Your baby’s probably ready for solids if
»
» He’s taking quite an interest in what you’re eating. Look for 
little chewing motions or for him to be reaching out for your 
mouth.
»
» She’s able to take food onto her tongue from a spoon and 
swallow it. Note: She’s not ready if she pushes food away 
with her tongue.
»
» He still seems hungry after a milk feeding.
»
» She’s a bit more unsettled at night, maybe requesting an 
extra night feed.
Be patient with introducing solids and don’t force-feed, ever. You 
can try introducing the same food several times over until your 
baby likes it. Don’t offer too many different foods at a time — 
stick to one new food every few days in order to check for poten-
tial allergic reactions. First foods can include the following:
»
» Baby rice or cereals
»
» Cooked and pureed carrot, pumpkin, avocado, or potato

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      167
»
» Mashed banana
»
» Strained and cooked apple and pear
The same old routine?
Most experienced dads agree on one thing — just when you think 
you’ve got a handle on things, everything changes. Got junior going 
for a nap every three hours? Sleeping through the night? Don’t get 
used to it — it’s bound to change! Growth spurts, mastering a new 
skill, or teething can unsettle your baby, and just as he gets ready 
to start eating solids, he may wake more often at night.
Your baby loves predictability; it gives her a sense of comfort to 
know what’s coming up in her day. So if you haven’t got your 
prince or princess into a routine, introduce one now. You don’t 
have to do everything by the clock; rather, just have a cycle (or 
a rhythm), so that your little one knows what’s coming up next. 
Repetition is also a primary mechanism for how babies learn, so 
routines and repeating things help on many levels.
If a strict schedule stresses you out because you don’t work like 
that or your baby doesn’t adhere to it, relax and do whatever 
works for your situation and your family. Trying to introduce 
some structure to your baby’s life is a positive step, but not at 
the cost of your sanity. Your stress can also affect your baby, so 
anything you do to reduce stress for both of you will make family 
life more pleasant.
Having a solid bedtime routine can help settle your baby for a 
good sleep pattern at night. The most popular version of a bed-
time routine goes something like this — and if mom’s not breast-
feeding, you can be in charge of the whole thing:
»
» Bath: A nice warm soak in the bath can lull most adults to 
sleep, and it works pretty well with babies too. Your little 
tyke will like it even more if you’re in the tub with him for 
some good ol’ skin-on-skin time — make sure the bathroom 
is nice and warm. Hold your baby on your chest or tummy, 
or on your propped-up thighs so junior can get a good look 
at you. Babies are slippery little beings, though, so hold on 
tight — and make sure mom’s on hand to scoop up your 
little one when it’s time to get out.

168      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Massage: Babies love touch — it’s the first sense they 
develop — and spending a little time soothing your baby 
with massage and engaging her with smiles and songs can 
be a pretty magical time of the day for both of you. Make 
sure her room is warm and be ready with the sleepwear so 
she can be wrapped up warm and cozy soon afterwards. 
Natural oils such as almond, olive, or calendula are great to 
use. If you have any fears about nut allergies, skip the 
almond oil. (See Chapter 7 for more on massaging your 
baby.)
»
» Last feeding: This is where you need mom if she’s breast-
feeding. If your little one is on formula, get in touch with your 
nurturing side, grab that bottle, and tank her up for a long 
sleep — another slice of “dad time” your baby can’t help but 
love.
»
» And into bed: With a little song, a rock in the rocking chair, 
and a final kiss, your little one soon learns that after a bath, a 
massage, and a last feeding, it’s always time for some serious 
sleeping.
A bedtime routine works even when you’re on vacation, going to 
friends’ houses, or staying at grandma’s.
You can adjust your baby’s sleep-time routine as he gets older, 
with reading stories, taking favorite toys to bed, or singing a 
special song together. It’s never too early to read or sing to him. 
(You’ll be amazed at what he picks up in the early days and “plays 
back” at you when he’s a bit older.)
Toys, toys, and more toys
No doubt your baby was given mountains of toys when she arrived. 
Now that she’s a bit older, she may enjoy playing with them even 
more. Make sure you keep some all-time favorites handy:
»
» Fabric books or Lamaze toys
»
» Rattles, squeaky toys, and bells
»
» Small balls and hoops — make sure they’re too big to put 
into your baby’s mouth!
»
» Stacking toys, boxes, and wooden rings

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      169
You don’t need to buy lots of toys — less is definitely more at this 
stage. Make sure your baby is exposed to different materials and 
surfaces. Plastic toys and battery-operated toys should be last on 
your list because they typically don’t offer a variety of textures 
and don’t encourage inventive play. They’re also expensive, and 
you then need to buy batteries constantly.
Many objects your baby will be interested in at this stage can actu-
ally be found in your household. A set of keys on a key ring, empty 
cardboard boxes, wooden clothes pegs, or fruit and ­vegetables can 
keep your little one entertained for hours. Remember, though, 
that most babies put everything in their mouths; make sure your 
baby’s “toys” are too big to fit into his mouth. Choking is a real 
hazard for children.
Getting On with Life
Life doesn’t stop just because your sweet little babe has joined the 
world. You still need to go out, visit friends, or frequent the odd 
café from time to time. The more people your baby meets, places 
he sees, and surroundings he experiences, the better for junior’s 
rapidly growing brain. So, get out there!
Out and about with your baby
Choosing the gear is a lot more fun than picking out fancy outfits 
for most dads! You get to choose from a wide range of options for 
carting your baby around, and you can try all of them, depending 
on your situation. Popping junior in a sling can work for a quick 
stroll to the convenience store for the paper, but a jog through the 
park may be better taken with baby in a stroller.
Strollers
During the first three months, your baby lies reasonably flat in the 
stroller. Now that she’s a bit older, you can prop her up a bit so she 
can see what’s happening. You may also want to invest in a light-
weight umbrella stroller, which is great for short trips and travel-
ing. Check the model to make sure it’s suitable for your baby’s age. 
Check out Chapter 4 for the lowdown on getting the right gear.

170      PART 2  The First Year
Slings and baby carriers
If you haven’t already, check out baby slings and baby carriers. 
They’re great for short trips around town. Proponents of baby-
wearing, like those who practice attachment parenting — in 
which a caregiver maintains contact with the baby at all times — 
swear by the benefits of having their baby in a sling or baby car-
rier. Babies carried in slings often sleep wherever you go, and you 
don’t have the potential hassle of trying to find a spot to park the 
stroller in a restaurant or store.
A ton of different baby carrier models are out there, each with 
different pros and cons — so shop around. Get your salesperson 
to fit them correctly to ensure you’re not squashing your precious 
bundle and that your back isn’t damaged.
The following are the most common types of slings and baby 
carriers:
»
» Asian slings are a rectangular shape with straps around both 
shoulders that can be worn in front or behind.
»
» Front carriers are like the backpacks you take hiking, only 
you put a baby in them! They have lots of padding and are 
usually made of canvas with adjustable straps. They can be 
worn with your baby facing in toward you or out to the 
world.
»
» Open- and close-tailed ring slings are adjustable and fit over 
one shoulder.
»
» Pouches are pockets of fabric worn over one shoulder and 
are very easy to get babies in and out of. They aren’t 
adjustable, though, so they can be worn only by the person 
they fit.
»
» Wraps are a piece of fabric that ties around the body. They 
take some getting used to, but they are said to be more 
comfortable in the long run than other slings.
Ask yourself these questions when choosing a sling or baby 
carrier:
»
» How well is the weight of the baby spread over my back and 
shoulders? Will I get tired after wearing it only a short while?

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      171
»
» Will it just be me using the sling, or is my partner getting in 
on the act?
»
» How easily do I need to be able to get junior in and out of the 
sling?
Some baby carriers have caused injury or even death, either from 
baby falls or from holding the baby in a position that impeded his 
breathing. Never use a second-hand carrier; it may not meet cur-
rent safety standards.
Traveling by car
In general, when taking your little person with you in the car, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you use the 
rear-facing car-seat position until your baby is at least 2 years 
old. Check the instruction manual for details of your model and 
check out Chapter 4 for a list of different types of car seats for 
infants.
Getting social
So you’ve got the latest stroller, your baby is in his flashiest gear, 
and you’re all ready to go. What can you do together?
»
» Music and movement classes, like Gymboree, mommy and 
me (although these really should be called “parent and me”) 
classes, infant swim times, and other group activities are 
great for getting those brain connections going, but they can 
be expensive.
»
» Playgroups are community-run groups of parents who get 
together to let their kids play while the adults mingle. Some 
have music sessions and provide lots of books and toys. They 
can be invaluable for perking you up on a bad day — having 
other people ooh and aah over your baby goes a long way 
toward putting a big grin on your face. The cost depends on 
who is running the class; informal groups organized by a few 
neighbors won’t cost you anything and can provide potential 
friends as your baby grows.
»
» Story time and music and play sessions at your local library 
are another tonic for isolated parents, and babies adore 
them. There is nothing like sitting among 30 other parents 

172      PART 2  The First Year
and babies singing “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” and having all 
30 babies laughing in delight. And these sessions are usually 
free.
Don’t be intimidated by female dominance in some of these social 
settings — you’re just as much a parent as the next mom. So wear 
your “dad and I’m proud of it” face and enjoy the attention.
Baby-proofing the house
Your little one is only just beginning to get her moves on, but 
watch out — in just a few short months she is going to be crawl-
ing and pulling up on everything, and open season will be declared 
on cupboards, bookshelves, and cables. What was out of reach one 
day is fair game the next. So now’s a good time to take baby-
proofing to the next level and ensure everything dangerous and 
precious in your house is either locked down or locked up.
We don’t want to sound like molly coddlers here, but household 
injuries are one of the main causes for emergency room visits for 
kids under age 3. And 70 percent of children who die from unin-
tentional injury at home are under age 4. So child safety at home 
is something to take seriously. Check out Chapter 7 for more about 
common safety hazards by room or area in your baby’s adventure 
playground and what to do to make these hazards safer.
You can never take your child’s safety for granted:
»
» Keep any potentially lethal substances like pet litter, garden 
fertilizers, cleaners, pesticides, alcohol, fire starters, and 
paints in a high cupboard with childproof locks.
»
» Young children can drown in a small amount of water, not to 
mention the hygiene risk of touching dirty areas like the 
toilet, so you’re best to keep the bathroom out of bounds.
You may not think so now, but when your baby is crawling and 
walking, she can move very, very quickly and get herself into 
trouble fast. The time spent baby-proofing your house (continu-
ously) can save your child’s life or prevent her being seriously 
hurt.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      173
To make sure you’ve got everything covered, get down to your 
baby’s height and see what is likely to tempt your curious child.
Wading through the necessary 
paperwork
By now you most likely have registered your baby’s birth, but you 
still have other bits and pieces of administration to take care of.
Insurance
Give some thought to getting life insurance if you haven’t already. 
If something happens to you, you’re going to want your family to 
be taken care of financially. Shop around for the best deal and to 
understand the various types of personal insurance. You can try 
your bank or home insurer as a first approach.
Give your health insurer a call to add your baby to your policy. 
Check before your baby is born to find out how long you have after 
her birth to add her to the policy.
Savings accounts
Many parents set up bank accounts for their new child and start 
saving for big purchases like a new bike or sports fees, or for far-
off expenses like college tuition or a deposit on a first house. Most 
banks have savings accounts for children with low or no fees.
IT’S ONLY MONEY
Babies and children have a unique way of exposing you to different 
points of view. For example, you’re sure to come to a different under-
standing of what’s valuable to you, mostly because your baby may 
eat, destroy, pee on, or draw on something that you hold dear. When 
that momentous event happens (and yes, it is “when,” not “if”), 
remember not to blame your little one. Until he’s much older, your 
baby isn’t going to understand the concept of material value — so if 
something is really, really precious, make sure you keep it out of reach 
(using a bank vault isn’t a bad idea!).

174      PART 2  The First Year
Taxes and benefits
Kids serve as a hefty tax deduction in the United States, and ­certain 
expenses, like child care, are also available as a credit to help work-
ing parents. Talk to a tax specialist to make sure you’re taking all 
the deductions you can to offset the cost of raising your child.
Wills and guardians
Make sure both you and your partner have updated your wills to 
take into account your new status as parents, and have thought 
about who can look after your baby should something happen to 
you. When thinking about who should be guardian if you and your 
partner die or are unable to look after your baby, make sure you 
ask the person(s) first before naming them in your will, and check 
whether they’re equipped financially and emotionally to add a 
new child to their family.
You may want to make special mention in your will of any senti-
mental belongings that you want to hand down to your child, like 
special clothing, photographs, or family heirlooms.
Immunization records
Keep a record of your baby’s immunizations — they may be required 
when your child starts childcare, kindergarten, or school. While 
your healthcare provider’s office will maintain these records in your 
child’s medical chart, it never hurts to keep a back-up copy at home.
Doing things together:  
You’re still a couple
Your relationship as a couple impacts your little one. Happy par-
ents, happy baby, they say. As a role model to your child, the 
relationship you have with your partner acts as a guide when he 
embarks on his own romantic endeavors.
But all your energy these days seems to go into baby, and with the 
lack of sleep going on right now, just collapsing on the couch at 
the end of a long day may seem like the easiest way to recharge. 
And, with all the attention your new bundle is getting from mom, 
you may not be feeling the love. So both of you have to work hard 
to ensure your relationship isn’t forgotten about.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      175
Make an effort and make time for each other. Schedule some time 
in the evening when baby is asleep and prepare a special dinner, 
or hire a babysitter and head out for the night. It doesn’t have to 
be anything fancy; just do something you both enjoy.
You’re probably wondering when sex returns to your relationship. 
Chances are you’re both pretty exhausted most days or the baby is 
actively preventing you from getting it on. Your partner may also 
not feel like having sex at the moment. The aftermath of the birth 
on her body combined with leaky boobs and that all-consuming 
tiredness may leave her feeling less than “bootilicious” right now. 
Well — basically, you just have to take it easy. Definitely bring up 
the subject and ask her how she feels about sex. Ask her to let you 
know when she’s ready to resume relations again. You may have to 
be a bit patient, but pressuring her is unlikely to speed things up.
Leaving Your Baby with Others
Inevitably the time comes when you and your partner need to 
hand over your precious baby to others. You may just need a break 
from the baby routine, or you may want to get back to working. 
This is a big deal, and many dads feel unsure about leaving baby 
with someone else (even grandparents or close relatives). Don’t 
panic — you can put your mind at ease (or at least you can try) 
with advance planning.
As with most things, the key to making this process work is effec-
tive communication. A key principle is to make sure the person 
who looks after your baby knows how you want things done.
IT’S THE (OTHER) LITTLE THINGS . . .
Sometimes, simply doing things together is what helps you feel good. 
Here’s a list of suggestions:
•	 Foot massages and back rubs
•	 Takeout dinner for two
•	 Taking a shower or bath together

176      PART 2  The First Year
Let your baby’s caregiver know the following:
»
» Your baby’s routine, generally.
»
» Your baby’s bedtime or naptime routine including any songs 
or stories that are part of putting your child down to sleep.
»
» Which foods are allowed and which aren’t.
»
» Any specifics about your little one such as tired signs, and 
signs that junior’s got a full diaper or is overstimulated. 
You’re an expert on this, after all.
»
» What creams or lotions you use (and, of course, any 
medication, if applicable).
»
» How you deal with the baby crying.
»
» Any potential safety issues around the house.
»
» How to get in touch with you; include alternate numbers just 
in case your cellphone dies. Every sitter should also know to 
call 911 in an emergency and to get the baby out of the 
house in case of fire. If your sitter knows CPR for infants, 
even better!
Family and friends
Those closest to you are possibly the easiest choice of caregiver 
if you need to take some time out and/or attend appointments. 
Make sure you feel totally comfortable with this arrangement, 
and be sure to brief them in the same way you would nonrelated 
helpers. Family members are most likely going to be stoked to 
spend some time with junior, and some one-on-one time is a 
great way to build an attachment with relatives.
Just ask the relatives how often they may want to do it, because 
you don’t want babysitting to become too much of a chore for 
them. Not all grandmas today want to spend all their free time 
babysitting — they’ve got their own full schedules!
Create a babysitting club with likeminded parents, especially if 
they’re friends you already know well, where you take turns look-
ing after each other’s babies.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      177
Nannies
A nanny is a professional who is trained to look after children 
in your home, and hiring one can be expensive — you’re paying 
the person’s income. Some nannies look after multiple children 
in one house, so you can team up with friends and split the cost.
Make sure you go with a reputable agency that has done all the 
necessary checks on the nanny and can guarantee your nanny has 
qualifications, knows basic first aid, and has been vetted by the 
police. If in doubt, ask to see your prospective nanny’s paperwork. 
Most importantly, check references.
A written contract is the most professional way to ensure that 
you and your nanny are on the same page about her duties, her 
pay, her use of a car, and other issues that may arise. If you have 
specific requests, for example, that she take your baby to the 
park daily, put it in the contract. You can’t argue with a signed 
document!
A nanny should
»
» Take care of your child’s physical, intellectual, emotional, and 
social needs — that is, feed him, play with him, and be 
someone he feels safe and secure with.
»
» Take care of your child’s laundry (not yours), cloth diaper 
cleaning, cooking, and bottle washing.
Hiring a nanny can be complex, especially if you’re providing a 
room for her to live in and paying her healthcare insurance. You’ll 
need to keep good records so you can properly file paperwork at 
tax time. A nanny can cost between $16 to $20 per hour, plus fees 
to the agency who places her. Live-in nannies are paid slightly 
less, because you’re supplying them with room and board.
Some agencies can also provide nannies from abroad (in some 
cases they’re referred to as au pairs). This may be a good way to 
expose your child to another language. However, au pairs usually 
stay with you for only up to 12 months.

178      PART 2  The First Year
While nannies are experienced caregivers, make sure you leave 
special instructions about your baby and the house. Also, nannies 
aren’t maids, so don’t expect them to do your washing and clean-
ing or to look after your household at the same time.
When choosing a nanny, interview the person with your baby 
there, and see how they interact together. The nanny should 
spend more time chatting and playing with the child than talking 
to you.
Some questions to ask prospective nannies include the following:
»
» What’s your family situation?
»
» What are your qualifications?
»
» How do you feel about me working from home from time to 
time?
»
» Why do you like children?
»
» What do you dislike about looking after children?
»
» What is your philosophy on boundaries and discipline?
»
» What is your philosophy on play and stimulation?
»
» What do you do when a baby is sick and you can’t wake her 
up? (Correct answer: Call 911!)
Babysitters
Babysitters are different from nannies in that they usually look 
after children just for a few hours — that is, a morning, after-
noon, or evening. The majority of sitters are cheaper, too, than 
nannies. Expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $20 an hour. If you 
go through an agency, you have to pay a placement fee and will 
probably face higher hourly charges as well.
In most cases you don’t need to worry about being late getting 
back (but check beforehand) — after all, they’re paid by the hour.
Teenage babysitters may be cheap, but they should still have 
access to adult help and a car with an approved safety car-seat 
restraint, in case of an emergency.

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      179
Interview your prospective babysitter just like you would a nanny 
(refer to the previous section). You’re leaving this person in 
charge of the most important person in your world!
Day care centers
Sending your little one off to day care can be a heart-breaking 
experience for a dad. It can be really hard on mom, too, so be there 
with a supportive shoulder and some reassuring words — and a 
box of tissues — if she’s upset.
You’re essentially entrusting your child to strangers in a strange 
place, so don’t hold back from getting to know your day care 
­center well. The more confident you are about the place, the 
more confident junior is likely to be as well. Make sure to visit 
the ­center more than once to get a good feel for what it’s like at 
­different times of the day.
You can find a range of different types of child care facilities — 
community, not-for-profit, and commercial. Many churches run 
day care centers, but many take only toddlers or preschoolers, not 
infants.
PUTTING IN A NANNY CAM
You trust your nanny or sitter — at least you want to. But this is your 
most precious possession you’re talking about, so how far should 
your trust go? On the other hand, you probably wouldn’t want some-
one filming you without your knowledge, although if you work in a 
hospital, a federal building, or any one of a million other places, you’re 
probably already being filmed, at least part of the time.
It’s legal in all 50 states to film without informing your nanny that 
you’re doing it, with some exceptions. You can’t film private areas like 
her room or, of course, the bathroom. In some states, you also can’t 
record audio, unless you tell your nanny you’re doing it.
If you can, it’s probably better to tell your potential nanny that you 
have cameras set up, so she doesn’t find them by accident.

180      PART 2  The First Year
Centers must have special programs for each age. Some take 
babies from 6 weeks old, and others don’t take children under 
age 2. Some have half-day attendance; others don’t. Some provide 
meals; others don’t. Shop around for what works best for your 
family. In the United States, day care centers charge an average of 
around $1,000 per month for full-time care.
Child care in some areas is in high demand. So register your inter-
est early if you want to make sure of a place for your little one 
when you need it. Waiting lists in bigger cities or popular neigh-
borhoods can be up to two years.
Here are a few things to look out for with a day care center:
»
» Do their opening hours work with your schedule?
»
» Do they charge if you’re late picking up your child?
»
» Do they check a permissions list for whomever is picking 
your child up? Do they ask for identification?
»
» Do they open during holidays, and if so, how much do they 
charge?
»
» What are the teachers like? Are they bubbly and fun to be 
with? Do they have a rapport with the children — remember 
that your child will most likely be continuing in day care for a 
few years — and communicate with them well? Is one 
particular teacher assigned to look after your child more 
than the other teachers?
»
» What qualifications do teachers have, and are they trained in 
first aid? Is there an AED (automated external defibrillator) 
onsite, and have staff been trained in how to use it?
»
» What philosophy does the center have on activities, play, 
discipline, and behavior issues? How do they handle chil-
dren’s behavioral problems such as hitting other children?
»
» What medicines do they have on the premises, and what is 
their policy on giving medicines to children? What happens if 
your child is hurt?
»
» Does the center have fire extinguishers, exits, alarms, and 
smoke detectors? What are their policies in case of emergen-
cies such as earthquakes or fire?

CHAPTER 8  Months Three to Six      181
»
» Do they have a webcam, where you can peek in on your child?
»
» What foods are the older children given? Can you request 
special food, like gluten-free or organic? Is the center 
nut-free?
»
» What happens at sleep time? Does the center have a policy 
on pacifiers, or special blankets and toys? What happens to 
children who don’t have a nap? Most centers usually have a 
dedicated sleep room, with a teacher checking on children 
every few minutes. Some centers provide bedding; others 
encourage you to bring your own.
»
» Is there a service for picking up children after school (looking 
ahead to the future again)?
»
» What activities are available at the center?
»
» Does the center take the children on trips outside the 
center?
»
» Are children separated by age once they become toddlers, or 
do they all play together after a certain age, say 2?
»
» Who should you speak to if you have any concerns?
»
» How do teachers keep track of your child’s progress? Most 
centers have a book with stories and pictures of your child’s 
activities.
Ask if the center is accredited by one of the national accreditation 
programs (see the following sites: www.naeyc.org/academy/, 
www.earlylearningleaders.org/?page=accreditation, 
and www.necpa.net/index.php). If not, ask why. Each state also 
has its own requirements for day care centers; make sure your 
center knows the regulations and complies with them.
After a few weeks, assess how well your child has settled in. 
Does your baby seem clean and well kept, and is she generally 
happy when you pick her up? Does the center have a bad habit of 
losing her extra outfits or blankets? Also, drop in unannounced 
to see what your child is up to. Make a regular appearance at 
lunchtimes — most centers offer days where parents can come 
in to eat with their children.

182      PART 2  The First Year
In-home care
In-home care with a trained caregiver looking after several 
­children at the same time in her own home is a different set-up 
from a day care center, but, in principle, you can still ask the same 
sorts of questions. With in-home care, also known as family day 
care, your child is usually placed with one caregiver, who looks 
after your little one (and other babies/children) in the caregiver’s 
own home.
Because you’re dealing with just the one caregiver, you can often 
get to know the person better than the teachers at a day care 
­center and can sometimes be a little more flexible in drop-off and 
pick-up hours.
To avoid both you and junior feeling anxious about the daily 
­routine and other issues, you’re best to take the time and energy 
to build rapport with the caregiver.
Go with a reputable company when choosing in-home care; they 
will have vetted your caregiver’s house for safety, given them 
training, and done police checks. Get references, talk to other 
parents, and spend time there at different times of the day.
So what’s important when choosing in-home care?
»
» Does your child get one-on-one attention?
»
» What learning program is in place? Is TV time limited?
»
» What foods are provided when your child gets older?
»
» What are the sleeping arrangements? (Single bed, bunk 
beds, floor space: Be sure you’re happy with the safety 
aspects, and make sure all cribs are newer and meet current 
safety standards.)
»
» What are the other children under the caregiver’s wing like?
»
» What happens if my sitter gets sick?
»
» What happens when my child is sick?
»
» What happens if I’m late picking up my child?
»
» Does the main caregiver know CPR?

Y
ou’ve firmly got a handle on this fatherhood business now, 
haven’t you? The next six months are all about your baby 
becoming more aware of her body and using it to get 
around, from rolling on the floor to getting up on her feet and 
doing that amazing thing babies do, walking. Witnessing your 
small, vulnerable child set out on the path to independence is 
amazing.
Of course, she needs you, her dad, to hold her hand as she makes 
her way. So keep up the good work; you’re doing a fantastic job!
But wait — there’s more to discover! In this chapter we show 
you how to cope with your baby’s ravenous appetite and what 
you need to feed her now that milk’s not cutting it anymore. And 
speaking of cutting, we let you in on tips so teething is less of a 
trauma for your baby. We show you the amazing changes your 
baby is going through to become a mover and shaker, and how to 
manage a trip or vacation with baby in tow. And last but not least, 
we conclude with a little party — your child’s first birthday.

184      PART 2  The First Year
Keeping Up with Baby
If you thought your baby changed a lot in the first six months, 
hold onto your burp cloth, because things don’t slow down  
just yet.
Your baby’s evolving diet
Until now, breast milk or formula has been all the food your baby 
needs. But to keep up with her growth, she needs to move on to 
solid food. Most health professionals and breastfeeding organi-
zations recommend waiting until baby’s around six months old 
before trying solids, which aren’t really that solid, more like puree 
and mush. But you may find your little one is ready to start a few 
weeks earlier than the six-month mark.
Signs that your baby is ready for solids
Your baby gives you some signs he’s ready for solids by
»
» Looking a bit famished after a milk feeding — he’s waiting 
around for more.
»
» Paying attention to what you eat, perhaps following your 
fork going into your mouth and making little chewing faces.
»
» Pointing at food on the table or trying to grab food that’s 
within reach.
»
» Being able to hold his head up for long periods at a time and 
take food onto his tongue. If he’s not ready for solids, he’ll 
push the food out again, called the extrusion reflex.
First foods and how to feed  
them to your baby
As your baby’s digestive system is still pretty undeveloped and he 
doesn’t have any teeth with which to break down food, first solid 
foods have to be pureed or mashed thoroughly so they’re almost 
runny. Some good first foods to try include

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      185
»
» Cooked and pureed apple, pear, apricot, peach, carrot, 
pumpkin, potato, peas, sweet potato, or green beans.
»
» Iron-enriched baby cereal or baby rice. You can use breast 
milk or formula to mix these.
»
» Uncooked and mashed banana and avocado.
Here’s how to feed solids to your baby for the first time:
»
» Give your baby a milk feeding first. Solid food comes after 
milk feedings until about eight months of age.
»
» Try one food, such as carrot, for three to five days in a row to 
make sure your baby has no reaction to that food.
»
» Try your first food when baby seems relaxed and happy, not 
when she’s super hungry, tired, or grumpy. Lunchtimes or 
early afternoons are often good times.
»
» If she’s not into her carrots at first, that’s okay. Try again 
tomorrow and if she’s still not into it, give her a few days 
before trying again. It can take ten attempts before your 
princess discovers her passion for a particular food.
»
» Let baby decide how much she needs to eat. Force-feeding 
her is not likely to make eating vegetables something she 
looks forward to. Let her appetite guide you. It may be only a 
few teaspoons at first.
A few things to remember about feeding solids to your baby are
»
» A baby’s sense of taste is very sensitive, and he won’t need 
salt, sugar, or spices to flavor a food.
»
» Some people insist on heating their baby’s food, but this is 
more a matter of adult taste than baby’s. If you do heat your 
child’s food, test it yourself before spooning it to him to 
make sure the food’s not scalding hot.
»
» You’ll need a highchair, a lot of bibs, and some sort of 
protective plastic matting for your floor — unless you like 
orange patterns on your kitchen floor.

186      PART 2  The First Year
»
» You can buy plastic feeding spoons, which are gentler on 
baby’s gums and smaller than teaspoons. They look huge 
compared to your little one’s tiny mouth.
»
» As your baby gets older, food can become more textured 
and less runny.
Adding new foods and routines
Once your baby has the hang of solid food, try mixing different 
foods for a range of flavors. Introduce meat into her diet, because 
at six months old she needs more iron to support the growth of 
her rapidly developing brain.
Cooked liver can be given to boost her iron supply, but only once 
a week as it contains a lot of vitamin A, which your baby can get 
too much of.
Try adding these foods to the menu:
»
» Cooked meat like beef, chicken, liver, and lamb; meat must 
be pureed, minced, or served as a broth so it’s soft and fine 
enough for an infant to eat
»
» Egg yolks (from hard-boiled eggs)
»
» Uncooked melon, plum, and nectarine
»
» Finger foods such as toast, cereals, and crackers
Try each food for three to five days to make sure your champ isn’t 
allergic to it. If he is, he’ll have a bloated tummy, a rash, or a 
hard time breathing. Call 911 right away if he’s having a severe 
reaction.
Honey is potentially lethal for babies up to 12 months of age. 
Honey can contain bacteria that release botulinum toxin, a neu-
rotoxin that can lead to severe food poisoning. Honey is safe to 
eat by toddlers from about 1 year of age because their digestive 
system is fully developed and can neutralize the toxins.
After eight months you can introduce these foods into baby’s diet:
»
» Cooked creamed corn, cabbage, and spinach

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      187
»
» Fish, unless your family has a history of fish allergy, in which 
case wait until your baby is a year old
»
» Pasta and rice
»
» Smooth peanut butter, unless there’s a family history of nut 
allergy, in which case wait until baby is 3 years old
»
» Soy foods like tofu and tempeh
»
» Uncooked kiwifruit, orange, berries, pineapple, and tomatoes
»
» Yogurt, cheese, custard, and ice cream, unless there’s a 
strong family allergy to dairy, in which case wait until your 
baby is a year old
At eight months, your baby can also start exploring finger foods 
such as slices of soft fruit, cooked vegetable pieces, grated cheese, 
and cooked pasta pieces. Avoid anything small and hard that may 
choke your baby, like hard nuts, popcorn, and hard candy.
If you’re not sure about when a particular food is okay to feed to 
your baby, check with your healthcare provider.
After eight months, solid food takes on more importance in baby’s 
diet and can be given before a milk feeding. Move baby onto three 
meals a day, with breast milk or formula snacks mid-morning 
and in the afternoon, if your doctor agrees.
Encourage family meals from the start. Pull the highchair up to 
the dining table so the three of you can enjoy your meals together. 
Your baby learns the mechanics of eating from you by copying, 
and you teach her that eating is about sharing a meal and eating 
healthy food together.
Don’t pass your food preferences to your baby. For example, if 
you don’t like broccoli, you needn’t put it in front of your baby in 
a way that makes it obvious you don’t like it. Why should he like 
broccoli if you present it poorly? Make encouraging noises, like 
“Yummy yummy broccoli,” when you serve food.
Taking care of teeth
In the coming months your baby gets her first teeth (see the sec-
tion on teething later in this chapter for more information), so 

188      PART 2  The First Year
you need a new piece of equipment — a tiny toothbrush. You can 
instill healthy oral hygiene early by making tooth-brushing time 
good fun.
Special low-fluoride toothpaste and soft toothbrushes for babies 
are available. You need only a pea-size dot of paste at the moment, 
if for nothing else than it provides a bit of taste for baby to think 
about while you brush his gnashers.
Brushing teeth with the little one is another perfect dad job. If 
you’re a working dad, you can integrate brushing teeth into your 
baby’s bedtime routine. That way you get even more daddy–baby 
time in your day.
Keeping up with your  
little ­explorer
From rolling over, to crawling, to pulling up, to cruising, to 
­walking — the next six months are characterized by your baby’s 
growing mobility and all the challenges that brings for dads. Of 
course, you followed our baby-proofing instructions in Chapter 7 
to the letter, and your house is a place where your baby can free 
range and explore to his heart’s content once he’s mobile. But 
you can’t just let him loose on your house to do his exploring. 
Instead, help his exploration by exposing him to all sorts of dif-
ferent materials and textures. Use plenty of chatting about what 
he’s experiencing to help develop his language at the same time.
The routines, they’re a-changing
All babies are different, but you may be surprised to wake one 
morning and find the sun’s up and baby hasn’t even made a 
whimper. This can be terrifying — you rush into her room to 
make sure nothing is wrong, only to be met by a sweetly sleeping 
baby who wakes just as you enter and greets you with a smile. 
Yep, your baby has slept through the night — a miracle!
If your baby hasn’t slept through the night after six months, 
don’t worry. Teething, getting enough to eat, and not having a 
developed sense of sleep yet can keep her waking up at night. 
Also bear in mind that sleeping through the night can mean from 

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      189
10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Don’t get stressed about getting your baby to 
sleep for 12 hours at a time — this may or may not happen with 
your little one.
You may also notice that baby is awake more and more during the 
day and is settling into having two naps a day, one in the morning 
and one in the afternoon. At six months, your baby needs about 
14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period. By 1 year of age, she may 
be giving up one of her naps in favor of a nap in the late morning 
or early afternoon. Let her decide when she naps by reading her 
tired signs.
A change in routine can be messy and may result in things being 
unsettled for a while, but if you roll with it and remember that 
everything is just a phase, things settle in no time at all. Some 
health professionals say that pretty much any routine can be 
changed over a period of two weeks (consistency is important), 
so don’t worry that you’re being locked into a schedule you can’t 
change.
With the rate of development your baby is going through right 
now and all the new skills he’s picking up, you may find he’s too 
excited for sleep and tries out his new party tricks at sleep time, 
such as pulling up on the side of his crib or crawling around his 
bed. Some babies pull up on their crib and find they can’t get down 
again, so they cry out for your help. Just ease him back down with 
your well-practiced settling techniques and wait for this phase to 
blow over. One sure thing about parenting and dealing with babies 
and kids is that things change frequently.
Adopting your own parenting style
As your baby becomes an active toddler, the way you manage 
her behavior comes to the fore. The researcher Diana Baumrind 
defines four different styles of parenting: authoritarian, authori-
tative, neglectful, and permissive. These parenting styles influ-
ence the relationship you have with your child, including how you 
manage discipline and behavior.

190      PART 2  The First Year
Each style has its own characteristics, and, although you may find 
yourself changing styles at times, most parents tend to adopt one 
of the following as their basic parenting philosophy:
»
» Authoritarian: A kind of parenting in which children are 
“seen and not heard” and the parent has high expectations 
that the child follow rules. Parents don’t allow for dialogue 
between themselves and their children, and are not respon-
sive to children’s wishes. It’s the parents’ way or the highway.
»
» Authoritative: This style of parenting also has high demands 
on the children to follow rules, but the parents also respond 
to their children, explain boundaries and limits, and encour-
age the child’s independence. Children know where they 
stand and are encouraged to have an open dialogue with 
their parents.
»
» Neglectful: Also known as detached or uninvolved parenting. 
The title says it all — parents don’t engage with children, 
children don’t have limits or boundaries, and parents are not 
responsive to children’s needs. This style of parenting has 
been linked to truancy and delinquency in teenage years.
»
» Permissive: Also known as indulgent parenting, parents have 
low expectations of the children but are highly responsive to 
them. The parents may be loving and nurturing, more like 
friends than parents, with few limits or boundaries for the 
children. This parenting style is likely to lead to some issues 
with authority as your child grows.
Your child needs your love and nurturing, to feel safe with you, 
and to know she has boundaries, which she will keep pushing 
until she’s well into her twenties! Have a chat with your partner 
about the way you would like to parent your child as she grows 
older. If you’re interested in more about parenting styles and dis-
cipline, check out Chapter 10, where we talk about the principles 
of effective discipline.
Hey, you’re getting good at this
Seen the way your baby responds to you these days? With smiles 
and squeals? He knows without doubt you’re his dad, and he 
thinks you’re a bit of a rock star.

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      191
Perhaps you’d like to take the reins for the day and spend a day 
alone with your baby. Send mom out for the day or let her have a 
day lounging in bed while you and your little one get your groove 
on together. You may even surprise yourself with how naturally 
being a dad comes to you now. Isn’t it amazing how far you have 
come on your fatherhood journey? Pat yourself on the shoulder 
and enjoy your new skills.
Playtime with Daddy
The second half of your baby’s first year is characterized by his 
growing mobility, which is great news for dads. Soon you’ll be at 
the park on slides and swings, or kicking a ball around. But you 
have to learn to walk before you can run, and you can help your 
little guy get the strength he needs to be on his feet.
Sitting, crawling, and walking
All babies are different and develop at different rates, but gener-
ally you can expect your baby to be
»
» Rolling over from her back to her front between three and 
six months
»
» Sitting unsupported between six and eight months
»
» Crawling between 8 and 11 months
»
» Walking between 11 and 17 months
Each stage of mobility is pretty exciting. The first time he rolls 
over, you may praise him like he’s just discovered a cure for can-
cer, and taking his first step is a moment to treasure. Activities 
and games you play together at all these different levels of mobil-
ity encourage your baby’s strength and learning.
Your baby is a little parrot and loves to mimic you. You help her 
move and learn just by being there and having time to play. She 
watches you sitting, getting up, and walking, and wants to copy 
what you’re doing.

192      PART 2  The First Year
Some activities to help your baby get the strength to reach these 
milestones include
»
» Sitting: To sit, your baby needs good head control and good 
balance, both of which are encouraged by tummy time. By 
lying on the floor on her tummy, she instinctively lifts her 
head to see you or any interesting toys nearby. You could 
even have a mirror in front of her so she can see another 
baby — and a miracle — two dads! You can encourage her 
balance with some gentle rolling, which helps develop the 
vestibular system in the ear that controls balance.
»
» Crawling: Once your baby is sitting unsupported for a while, 
he’ll start to want to reach out for things around him and 
then work out how to get back onto his tummy. From here 
he’ll work out how to move his body forward and commando 
crawl by almost slithering along the floor! As he builds 
strength in his arms and legs, he’ll get up on all fours and 
work out how to propel himself forward, and voilà — he’s 
crawling.
You can develop your baby’s strength by putting things out 
of his reach that he can move toward, like blocks, or by 
rolling a ball near him. When he is crawling confidently, 
challenge him by giving him tunnels to climb through or 
chairs to crawl under. Get down on your hands and knees 
and chase him along — babies love to be chased! Don’t 
forget to give baby lots of different textures to try out, like 
crawling on grass, carpet, your bed, or at the beach.
»
» Walking: As she gets stronger, your little one will figure out 
that she can pull herself up to standing on solid objects like 
walls, her highchair, or her crib. She may want to hold your 
hands and walk everywhere, using you for balance. After 
some months of practicing, she’ll have the confidence and 
balance to stand by herself and take a few wobbly steps on 
her own.
No doubt she’ll have a lot of falls and there will be tears, but 
falls and tears are all part of the learning process, and she 
will gain confidence, balance, and strength. Be there with a 
kiss and a cuddle for those bumps and scrapes.

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      193
People may say to you that once your baby’s walking she’ll 
be into everything, and you won’t get a moment’s peace. 
That’s a very limited view of parenting, because there’s a 
huge upside to it. Your baby can now explore much more of 
the outdoors, kick balls around in the yard, and explore just 
about everything much more easily, without being depen-
dent on you. This is a huge step toward independence and 
should be celebrated. When your child is walking, she can do 
things like greet you at the door when you get home from 
work or hold your hand as you walk together to the park, 
and express her preferences and personality more. Of 
course this new freedom does come with a need for extra 
vigilance for parents.
When your child is walking, be prepared for her to run away 
(and expect you to chase her). Be vigilant — she can 
disappear in a flash when your back is turned. Take extra 
care around roads, dogs, and water. Double-check your 
baby-proofing now that your toddler is upright. Make sure 
that gates on stairs are secure, cover all sharp edges (such  
as those on brick fireplaces and coffee tables), and put 
childproof coverings over outside door handles.
Not all babies develop in the same order. Some miss crawling and 
shuffle along on their bottoms, like little crabs, or go straight to 
walking. If you’re concerned about your baby’s development, talk 
to your healthcare provider. And don’t compare your kiddo with 
the neighbor’s kid — even if they were born within five minutes 
of each other. Each child has her own developmental timetable.
Talking the talk
Just as the first year is shaped by baby’s growing mobility, the 
second year is shaped by language and emotional development. 
But just because your baby isn’t talking yet doesn’t mean she 
can’t understand you. In fact she’s soaking up what and how 
you’re saying things to her. When she’s figured out how to get 
her lips and tongue and mouth coordinated, language tumbles out 
of her mouth.
Your baby’s babbling and raspberries, shouts and whoops are all 
attempts to communicate, although she hasn’t mastered language 

194      PART 2  The First Year
yet. Observing her attempts at language is often hilarious. She 
may turn to you with a serious face and deliver a speech in what 
sounds like Mongolian or some ancient language, which you can’t 
make heads or tails of. If you respond with “Really?” or “Is that 
so?” she’ll keep going, and eventually words you recognize will 
start emerging.
Babies learn by repetition, so reading the same book over and 
over, or using the same phrases for activities like changing a dia-
per or making her cereal, all sink in. Your little one is learning to 
associate words or phrases with activities, objects, and situations. 
So don’t be surprised if you hear her say things exactly the way 
you do (and that goes for everything, so if you don’t want your 
child to use certain words, hold your tongue when she’s around).
Talk to your child and let him know what is happening today: 
“Today, honey, we are going to see Brian, and then we are going 
to the supermarket and then home for a snack.” He may not say 
anything in response, but he’s soaking up those words.
Children use different speech sounds at different ages. When your 
child will make certain speech sounds depends on how difficult 
they are to make. For example, some sounds such as “m” and “b” 
are easy to say and these will probably be some of the first sounds 
your little one makes.
For more information about when to expect your little one to start 
using certain speech sounds, go to www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/
voice/pages/speechandlanguage.aspx#1.
Along with “duck,” “ball,” and “dog,” your baby will pick up the 
less savory words that he hears around the house. Censor yourself 
early on — you don’t want junior announcing to the world he can 
swear like a sailor when grandparents come to stay. This also goes 
for what you say about other people. Kids have a remarkable way 
of remembering all the things you said about Brian a few days ago 
and telling Brian everything you said the next time he sees him.
Introducing your baby to water
One of the joys of having a baby over six months old is that you 
can go swimming in a pool together! Before then, his immune 

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      195
system is probably not up to it—he’s not able to control his tem-
perature well, and his neck muscles aren’t strong enough to allow 
him to control his head. Public pools often have separate pools for 
babies and toddlers, and it can be worthwhile taking swimming 
lessons with your little one, as much for your own confidence 
handling your baby in the water as for baby’s sake.
Instructors can show you how to glide your baby through the 
water, help him float on his back, and eventually put his head 
underwater. At this age, being in the pool is all about having fun 
and becoming confident in the water.
You can buy special swimmer diapers that hold in any urine or 
stool that junior may do while in the pool. Many pools insist that 
young children wear these.
If your baby has had diarrhea, keep her out of a public pool for at 
least two weeks. If baby has eczema, chlorine and water may irri-
tate it, so put the swimming on hold until the eczema has cleared 
up. Avoid going to the pool altogether if your baby is unwell, 
­particularly if he has an ear infection.
Instilling a sense of confidence around water in your child now is 
a good idea, so start teaching basic water safety. Always super-
vise your child around water. Children ages 1 through 4 have the 
­highest drowning rates. A child can drown in any amount of water. 
See www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Water-Safety/
waterinjuries-factsheet.html for more information.
These tips can help keep your child safe in and around water:
»
» Empty the bath or paddling pool as soon as you’ve finished 
with it.
»
» Fence your pool. Check your town ordinances to see 
whether your fencing meets the requirements.
»
» Stay within arm’s reach of your child in or near the water. If 
the phone rings when junior is in the bath, either ignore it or 
take your baby with you to answer it. If you have a cordless 
phone or cellphone, take it to the bathroom as you’re 
preparing the bath.

196      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Keep your eye on your child every minute while he’s in or 
around water. Many drownings occur even when a parent is 
“right there” because he took his eyes off the child for a 
minute. If more than one person is “watching the baby,” be 
very clear about which of you is actively watching; never 
assume other eyes are on your child.
Connecting with playgroups
No matter how much fun you’re having with your baby at home, 
there will be days when you just have to get out and see adults. 
Going along to a playgroup can be a good way to entertain your 
little one and get some much-needed adult company at the same 
time. One of the great things about playgroups is that there’s 
a whole range of ages and stages, and plenty of other dads and 
moms to talk with about what’s happening in your little one’s 
world and what’s coming up next.
Playgroups are usually a group of parents getting together in a 
community center, church, or other public space where children 
can play safely and parents can meet other parents. Playgroups 
can also meet at homes, with everyone taking a turn in hosting 
the group. You could even start your own playgroup if one isn’t in 
your area. Some playgroups organize musical sessions, have arts 
and crafts available, and provide morning or afternoon snacks for 
a small donation.
Children love being around other children, even if at this age they 
don’t really interact with each other. Playgroups at churches or 
other community centers often have bigger toys, better books, 
and lots more activities than you could fit into your house — all 
good things for challenging your little one.
Before you join a playgroup in your community, ask yourself these 
questions:
»
» Are there activities suitable for my child’s age?
»
» How safe are the facilities?

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      197
»
» Is the playgroup convenient for me? Does it work for baby’s 
sleep time, is it easily accessible for strollers, and does it cost 
much?
»
» What is the policy for dealing with other people’s children? 
Am I allowed to pick up another person’s child? How is 
conflict between children handled?
»
» Who is running the playgroup? Is there a commercial interest 
behind it?
Check out www.parenthood.com/article/how_to_start_and_run_ 
a_successful_playgroup.html#.VreUa1loThU for ideas on how to 
start and run a playgroup.
Who needs toys when you’ve  
got wrapping paper?
If you like gadgets, you’ll love the toys that are on the market 
these days. You may find yourself piling up the shopping cart 
with battery-operated products that do all sorts of funny stuff or 
claim to turn your child into a genius. As well as the toys you buy, 
toys also turn up as gifts, your baby inadvertently steals them at 
­playgroup, or you receive toys free with some other baby-related 
purchase, so you may find gadgetry piling up in your house.
But apart from the few toys we mention in Chapter 4 — cloth 
books, soft toys, teething toys like car keys and rattles — your 
baby doesn’t really need most of the battery-operated toys for his 
development.
You certainly don’t need to buy a lot of toys at this age to stimu-
late development, because you already have lots of really cool toys 
in your house right now. You just may not realize they are toys.
Here are a few examples. Babies love things that they can
»
» Explore, like wrapping paper, pieces of cloth, a set of keys (best 
to use keys you don’t actually need), or old books to gnaw on. 
Watch out for small pieces that present a choking hazard.
»
» Make noise with, like pots and pans. Give baby a wooden 
spoon and let her drum happily away.

198      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Mouth, like wooden pegs, wooden spoons, and those plastic 
spoons you’re feeding him solids with (be vigilant about 
choking hazards).
»
» Shake, like a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid half filled 
with rice, or a plastic milk bottle with pasta shapes inside. 
Glue the lids on with hot glue or Super Glue.
»
» Stack, such as food containers. Small cardboard boxes or 
plastic bottles (which you can fill with confetti, rice, or pasta) 
can also be stacked.
Many babies find everyday objects, such as remote controls and 
cellphones, far more interesting than their toy version. A toy ver-
sion will be thrown aside for the real thing any day. Take the bat-
teries out of an old remote or phone and let your little one push all 
the buttons she likes without risking a call to Brazil.
If the temptation to try lots of different toys takes you, you 
can avoid spending a small fortune by buying costly items like 
an ExerSaucer (an activity station that you sit your baby in) or 
dress-up outfits used. Or organize a clothing and toy exchange 
with other families in the neighborhood or in your church or other 
social groups.
Toys with small parts are still off limits for little ones. Anything 
with parts smaller than a film canister are considered a choking 
risk, so wait until your baby is at least 3 years old before letting 
him play with toys with small parts.
Here Come Some Milestones
As we approach the end of the first year, the stay-at-home parent 
has usually returned to work as obligated under the terms of his 
employment. Time to sit back and reflect on the past year as your 
baby approaches her first birthday and becomes a toddler.
Preparing to return to work
Dads are not necessarily the ones bringing home the bacon 
these days while baby is small. Increasing numbers of fathers 

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      199
are staying home with their babies while mom goes back to paid 
employment. But sooner or later, most dads also find themselves 
joining the rat race and returning to work. Check out Chapter 16 
for more on stay-at-home dads.
Before you head off with your briefcase, though, sit down with 
your partner and think about these things:
»
» How will you manage days when your child is sick and can’t 
go to day care, or days when her nanny is sick? Who will take 
off work?
»
» How will you manage your time? Will you have time to juggle 
work and family? Will you have time to spend with your 
partner?
»
» Who’ll take care of the baby? See Chapter 8 for more about 
other people taking care of your child, such as day care and 
nannies.
»
» Will the costs of child care outweigh the benefits of both of 
you going back to work?
Waiting lists for some day care centers or nursery schools can be 
up to two years long, so call around and get yourself on waiting 
lists as soon as you can.
Keeping work and family time separate is a struggle in this high-
tech age, when employees and business associates expect to reach 
you 24/7. However, you can set a few rules for yourself so that 
you’re not burnt out by work or short-changing your family. Make 
it a rule that if you have to bring work home, you wait until your 
baby is in bed before bringing out the work, or that your phone is 
switched off when you walk through the front door at night.
Likewise, when you’re at work, the more productive you are the 
less likely you may be to have to bring work home. Keeping in mind 
that time spent working is time you can’t be with your child helps 
keep you focused and value the time the two of you have together.
Going on vacation
The idea of taking a demanding, pooping, sometimes crying 
child who is wholly dependent on you for his survival on vacation 

200      PART 2  The First Year
sounds a little like an oxymoron. There’s nothing vacation-
like about looking after a baby! Vacations aren’t the same with 
­children, but at some stage in the first year you may want a break 
from staring at the same old walls.
Going on a short trip isn’t such a big deal, but if you’re going any-
where farther away than a couple of hours’ drive, you need a few 
strategies to stop everyone going mental on the journey.
Driving without going crazy
Imagine if you were strapped into a car seat with a full harness at 
the front. You’d get pretty uncomfortable after a couple of hours, 
and if you couldn’t stretch and move around of your own free will, 
you’d get a bit grumpy too. So will your baby if you don’t stop 
every now and then to let him have a breather, some food, or a 
diaper change.
Here are some more ways to manage a long car trip with your 
baby:
»
» If you’re traveling during summer, keep baby lightly dressed, 
as he can get pretty sticky on his back or anywhere that is 
touching his car seat. Use visors on windows to keep glare 
out of his face and to protect him from the sun. Make sure he 
has a cup or bottle of water on hand to stop him becoming 
dehydrated. Avoid driving in the heat of the day if you can.
»
» Make sure you’ve got some snacks prepared for the trip. You 
wouldn’t want to get caught out miles from anywhere with a 
hungry baby who won’t be satisfied with a breastfeed or 
bottle. It also means you’ve got food for baby should you 
break down, heaven forbid.
»
» Plan your trip around when baby is due to sleep because, 
with any luck at all, the motion of the car will send him off to 
sleepyland.
»
» Take plenty of toys or objects to keep your little one enter-
tained while awake. Books or his favorite teddy bear are also 
great. If you can, bring a new toy or something he hasn’t 
seen before. That way you can keep him interested for 
longer.

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      201
Drive safely at all times. Your most precious person is in the back 
with you, so don’t take any chances. Never take the baby out of 
the car seat, not even for “just a minute” or for a feeding. Pull 
over if you need to take him out.
Up, up, and away
The idea of air travel with a baby can strike fear into the most 
experienced dads, especially today, when children (and their 
parents) are getting kicked off flights, seemingly just for being 
children. The perils of confined space and air pressure issues 
coupled with the idea of sitting within smelling and screeching 
distance of other passengers aren’t to be taken lightly, but they’re 
manageable.
Here are some ways to make flying with your baby easier:
»
» Have plenty of books and toys to keep her entertained. 
Organize new things that your little one hasn’t seen before.  
A great strategy is to wrap toys, books, and other things your 
baby is used to as if they were presents. Unwrapping the 
“present” is fun and adds to the excitement.
»
» If baby’s restless, take him for a walk up and down the aisles. 
Seeing other people cheers him up and gets you out of your 
seat as well.
»
» If other parents with babies are on board, make contact with 
them. They may come in very handy if you need an extra 
pair of hands or for keeping an eye on baby while you eat or 
go to the toilet. Most parents of young children are quite 
helpful as they know what traveling with babies is like. The 
grandma in the next seat may even be more helpful!
»
» Don’t expect much, if any, help from the crew. The days of 
helpful crew members holding your baby or even heating a 
bottle have pretty much gone by the wayside.
»
» If you’re traveling on a long flight, book the bulkhead seat 
that most major airlines offer. You will at least have extra leg 
room for your baby to play on the floor at your feet.

202      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Pack a drink because the swallowing action helps your baby 
equalize her ears. If mom’s on hand, breastfeeding during 
takeoff and landing can help too. If mom’s not available, give 
your baby something to drink or eat during takeoff and 
landing.
»
» Bring your baby’s airline-approved car seat. Your baby will be 
more comfortable and also safer in it.
»
» Stay calm. If you’re calm, baby will most likely be calm too.
»
» Take a fully packed diaper bag with diapers, a changing 
mat, wipes, plastic bags for dirty diapers, diaper cream, 
spare clothes, and snacks or jars of baby food. And lots of 
toys — lots.
»
» When you check in, hold onto your stroller until you board 
and then gate-check it. Navigating through airports and 
departure lounges and carrying all the bags is a lot easier 
when you’ve got a safe place to put baby.
If you’re traveling overseas, your baby needs his own passport.
If you’re staying overnight somewhere, you need
»
» A crib for baby to sleep in, with appropriate bedding. Most 
hotels and motels have portacribs, but check when you 
make your booking. When you get there, make sure the 
model you’re given is safe and in good condition.
»
» A mini first-aid kit of teething remedies, pain reliever, and 
any lotions and potions your baby needs.
»
» A stroller or baby carrier, depending on how much walking 
you plan to do.
»
» Diapers and diaper-changing accessories.
»
» The usual clothes, toys, and books.
Wow, that’s strange: Addressing 
your concerns
By now, you know your baby well enough to know when some-
thing’s not quite right. You may discover something unexpected, 

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      203
such as a rash, or your baby makes a fuss at something specific, 
or something just doesn’t feel right.
Father knows best
Sometimes it may be easy to figure out the problem; other times, if 
you ignore it, it will likely go away on its own. Or you can do some 
research and deal with your concerns. This doesn’t mean ­buying 
every book in the store about childhood illness, but observing 
your baby’s body and moods and acting accordingly.
Nobody expects you to know everything about your baby, but you 
are the best judge if something’s not right. Trust your instincts 
and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Healthcare 
­providers are there to provide help.
Get involved in your child’s healthcare. If something’s wrong, 
don’t leave it to mom to work out or take him to the doctor; get 
in on the act as well. You’ll be prepared for when the problem 
­happens again.
Teething
Teething is the biggest issue for babies aged 6 to 12 months. 
Having a sharp tooth cut through her gum can be very upsetting 
for your child, especially because she won’t understand what’s 
going on.
Signs that baby is teething include the following:
»
» Her cheeks may be bright red.
»
» She drools a lot.
»
» She puts objects in her mouth more than usual.
»
» She may get diaper rash.
»
» She’s more cranky and clingy.
»
» She may run a low-grade fever. Doctors’ opinions differ as to 
whether this is a “normal” part of teething, so ask yours.

204      PART 2  The First Year
Here are some simple ways to help relieve her discomfort:
»
» Teething necklaces can help teething babies. These are 
special necklaces that can sometimes be chilled in the 
refrigerator to make them more soothing for swollen gums.
»
» Chilled apple slices wrapped in a piece of muslin cloth tied 
with a band are soothing and healthy for her too. Baby sucks 
and gums the apple, but bits can’t come free in her mouth. 
Chill fruit in the fridge, not the freezer.
»
» Some parents swear by commercial teething gels, but make 
sure you’re happy with the ingredients in them first.
»
» Toys with some “give” in them and texture can help numb 
pain when baby bites on them by causing counter pressure. 
Some toys can be filled with liquid and chilled in the fridge.
As tempting as it may be, don’t put teething toys with gels in the 
freezer. This may make them too cold, which can cause more pain 
for your little one.
If all else fails and baby is just too upset with all these remedies, 
some infant acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be given. Check with 
your healthcare provider about the correct dosage for your child’s 
age and weight.
When baby is teething, he needs more cuddling and may be a bit 
clingy. He may wake up at night more and be difficult to settle. 
Try to be patient — teething is not much fun. The love you show 
your child when he needs you like this builds trust and security 
in your baby.
How time flies
Now that you’re a dad, time seems to evaporate in front of your 
eyes. Fatherhood is like a whirlwind tour of your favorite places 
in the shortest time possible. If you don’t take photos and keep a 
diary, you soon forget the journey. So much happens in the first 
year. Not only does your baby transform into a toddler, but you 
and your partner are also transformed into completely awesome 
parents.

CHAPTER 9  Months Six to Twelve      205
So how can you capture this first year?
»
» Keep a diary. You could even do it online with a blog.
»
» Take lots of photos of your little one. Pictures paint a 
thousand words.
»
» Start a book for your child where you can record her first 
words and foods, and the dates when she first rolled over, 
crawled, and walked. You can also keep photos and memen-
tos in the book.
None of this makes any difference if you’re not interested in 
recording these memories. Be interested in contributing to a diary 
and your photos and spend loads of time having fun with your 
baby when you take them. When your child becomes interested in 
his past, he’ll really appreciate the effort you put into recording 
him as a baby.
One year old today!
What, already?! Your baby isn’t a baby anymore — she’s a toddler 
now. How did that happen? Didn’t you only just bring her home 
from the hospital brand-new, like, last week?
Congratulations to you and your partner. Marking this milestone 
is just as much for you, the parents, as it is for your child — in 
fact, probably more! One year ago your baby was born and turned 
your lives upside down.
So gather your family and friends and celebrate your baby turn-
ing one. A birthday celebration is an excellent way to thank those 
around you for all the support they’ve given you over the last year 
and to cement your child’s place in your family.
Your baby won’t remember or even understand that today is her 
birthday, but if you want to mark the day with a child’s party, 
here are some tips to make it memorable:
»
» Plan well in advance to allow yourself enough time to get 
everything done.
»
» Plastic cups and plates make cleaning up easier and, with 
little ones around, make breakages less likely.

206      PART 2  The First Year
»
» Provide food for adults as well as safe food for children. 
Avoid nuts and hard foods that may choke little ones. Have  
a balance between healthy and treat foods.
»
» Take lots of photos! Baby won’t turn one again.
»
» Time the party around sleep times. You don’t want the 
superstar of the day to be grumpy because he should be 
sleeping. Other parents will be working around their 
children’s sleep times too, so expect people to be late and 
leave after only an hour or two.
Start the day with quiet family time so you, your partner, and your 
child can look back on the past 12 months and marvel at what you 
have now in front of you.

H
owever challenging toddlers can be, the second year of life 
is also a delightful age. Language, social, and motor skills 
are all developing, and toddlers can surprise you with what 
they understand and repeat back to you as they grow. Your little 
eagle-eye will remember where you hid the cookies, can figure 
out what the remote control does, and will mimic your gestures 
and movements in such a sweet, naïve way that it will make you 
crack up with laughter.
Your child’s first words may be a little predictable — Mom, 
Dad, ball, dog, more. But be prepared for some unexpected 
words — noisy, heater, dinosaur, or even toothbrush. Kids this 
age are often called sponges and that’s what they are, suck-
ing up knowledge like you wouldn’t believe. The kid who just 
celebrated his first birthday is going to be quite a different boy 
when he turns 2.

210      PART 3  The Toddler Years
In this chapter, you find out all about his development, as well as 
how to cope as he deals with frustration, anger, and all ­manner 
of emotions he can’t figure out. We also take you through the 
changes in your child’s eating, sleeping, and health and safety 
needs.
Hey, You Have a Toddler Now
Once your child starts to walk, she magically transforms from a 
baby into a toddler. Just the word toddler can strike fear into a 
dad: Toddlers have a reputation for getting into trouble. Your little 
one is also a ticking tantrum time bomb now. You’ve probably 
heard the saying “terrible twos,” meaning that at the stroke of 
midnight on her second birthday your formerly perfectly pleasant 
baby turns into a monster of unequalled horribleness.
It doesn’t quite work like that, thank goodness. And as your 
­toddler creeps toward being an independent little person, she’ll 
be struggling between needing her dad every step of the way and 
wanting to do things her own way, thank you very much. This 
means she will sometimes have little meltdowns when what you 
want her to do and what she wants to do collide. This can start as 
early as right now.
If your toddler suddenly starts resisting diaper changes, ­getting 
into her car seat, or having to sit in a shopping cart, she hasn’t 
turned into a monster, she’s just continuing her struggle to 
become an individual and have her own free will. We talk later 
on in this chapter about how to deal with taxing toddler behavior.
Sleeping update
Most dads by now are enjoying a good night’s sleep as junior is 
no longer getting up for feedings in the early hours. That said, 
don’t expect your toddler to sleep through every night. Teething, 
colds, being too hot or too cold, having just mastered a new skill, 
or simply needing some cuddle time will still have him calling out 
for you in the night. Often this is just temporary, and you’ll be 
getting 40 winks again in no time.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      211
Some toddlers also start to have nightmares and night terrors, 
where they wake up screaming or lashing out at you. Be there 
with comforting arms and some soothing words. Make bed a really 
happy, attractive place to be with soft toys and special blankets, 
which toddlers can get very attached to. Make sure there’s lots of 
love and good feelings at bedtime.
Most toddlers go through some sort of separation anxiety in the 
first year, and it often comes back in the second. Your toddler 
may cling to you more, need more reassurance, and object to you 
leaving the room. Explain to your toddler that you’re not going far 
or will be back soon, and some other lovely person will look after 
him while you’re gone.
At about the one-year mark, many children go from two naps 
during the day to one nap, which is usually taken in the middle 
of the day. Let your child work out how much sleep he needs by 
watching for his tired signs — yawning, becoming a bit clumsy, 
gazing into the distance, and becoming a cranky bear — and 
­putting him down for a nap then.
At some point he will start missing a nap, needing only one. 
Sometimes he may seem tired in the afternoon but will resist 
going to sleep and by early evening will be exhausted and falling 
asleep in his dinner plate, so try moving his bedtime forward a bit 
until he gets used to his one-nap-a-day routine.
Eating update
The start of this year will see a change in your little one’s diet. 
As she grows more teeth, she’ll be able to handle a bigger ­variety 
of foods and foods with chunkier textures. With her digestive 
and immune systems maturing, your toddler can handle foods 
that were once off the menu, such as cow’s milk, honey, and egg 
whites.
Small, hard foods like popcorn and nuts are still off the menu 
until junior is at least 3 years old, because of the choking risk.
Offer your child a variety of foods. What he doesn’t like one day, 
he may love the next, so keep trying with things he has turned his 
nose up at before.

212      PART 3  The Toddler Years
A typical toddler needs the following:
»
» At least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day. A serving 
is the amount that fits into your child’s hand. Vitamin C helps 
your child absorb iron, so include some vitamin C–rich fruits 
like citrus fruit or kiwifruit.
»
» Iron from red meat, chicken, or fish, or vegetarian options 
like spinach and broccoli.
»
» Dairy, but not low-fat. Young children need fat to grow, but 
keep the French fries and burgers for special treats. Toddlers 
need about 3 cups of dairy a day, which may be given as 
milk, cheese, yogurt, and the like. Don’t allow your toddler to 
fill up on dairy and miss out on other nutrients. This is the 
age to eliminate bottles and switch to sippy cups. 
Breastfeeding toddlers will probably begin to nurse more for 
comfort than for nutrition.
»
» Breads and cereals, but not heavy whole grains or bran until 
he’s at least 2 years old.
Limit the number of sweet snacks such as dried fruit, candy, and 
cookies because of their tooth-damaging sugar content. Addi-
tives and high sugar content in “junk” food have been linked to 
altering children’s moods and making them possibly even more 
energetic than they typically are anyway, although studies have 
never proven this. Unfortunately, juice boxes — a staple of many 
toddler diets — are also very heavy in sugar content and should 
be limited or saved as a special treat.
Toddlers don’t need to eat as much as they did in their first year 
of life and often become picky eaters, besides. One way to get your 
toddler the nutrients he needs is to offer a smorgasbord of foods 
in a muffin tray or other dish with small compartments. Put a 
little fruit in one, a little cereal in another, peanut butter on a 
cracker, a few pieces of cheese, and soft veggies to round out the 
variety, and let him pick what he wants.
Now that your toddler is able to experience more texture and 
variety in her meals, she can have toddler versions of your meals 
and eat with you. This is a good time to teach your child about 
the social aspects of eating, with all of you around the table talk-
ing about your day and about the food in front of you. Make sure 

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      213
the TV is off and just hang out together as a family. Seeing you 
eat good, healthy meals encourages your child to eat healthily 
too. The American Academy of Pediatrics supplies some guide-
lines for healthy eating at www.healthychildren.org/English/ 
healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Childhood-Nutrition.aspx.
The toddler years are often when children start to show signs of 
food allergies. Rashes, hives, and gastrointestinal upsets are the 
most common signs of a food allergy; more serious reactions, 
such as wheezing, shortness of breath, collapsing, or turning 
blue, require immediate medical help. Six foods — milk, eggs, 
peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat — cause around 90 percent 
of all allergic reactions. Introduce these foods one at a time, with 
several days between each introduction.
Lactose intolerance is not an allergy and rarely affects children 
under the age of 2. Lactose intolerance — more common in children 
of Asian, African American, or Hispanic/Latino descent — causes 
gastrointestinal upset. This usually occurs within 30 minutes to 
2 hours after ingesting foods containing lactose, which includes 
most dairy products.
Health update
Try not to forget that your child, even though she’s not a baby any-
more, still needs to keep up-to-date with her immunizations. To 
immunize or not to immunize is a hot debate in the United States 
today, with most pediatricians solidly in favor of ­immunizing. Many 
will adjust the schedule if you don’t want your toddler getting too 
many vaccinations at one time. See the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s recommended immunization schedule at www.cdc.
gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf.
If your child is now at child care, he’s likely to pick up every 
germ on the planet, and will have between 6 and 12 colds a year — 
which is why it seems as if he constantly has a runny nose. Even 
kids who aren’t in child care are vulnerable to the viruses flying 
around, and it may sometimes seem as if junior’s only just getting 
over one cold before another one comes along.
Children have the same symptoms of a cold as adults — runny 
nose, cough, headache, sneezing, and swollen glands. He may 
also run a low-grade fever. He’ll probably wake up more often in 

214      PART 3  The Toddler Years
the night for comforting and be a bit miserable during the day. 
Unfortunately, you can’t give your child any cold medication, but 
you can give extra fluids, the correct dosage of acetaminophen or 
ibuprofen (by age), and lots of cuddling to make him feel a bit less 
miserable. A cool-mist humidifier may also help.
At this age, you can also show your child how to blow her nose, or 
at least wipe it, or blow it while you hold the tissue. Most children 
get a great sense of satisfaction and achievement in then putting 
their dirty tissue in the trash bin. Give your child heaps of praise 
when you show her how to do it, so blowing her nose is not a 
chore but a fun thing to do.
You can use nonmedicated means to lessen your child’s discom-
fort and congestion. See Chapter 7 for some tips.
Mingling with other children in the wider community also brings 
your little star into contact with germs that are nastier than the 
common cold. You may find she’s come down with one of the fol-
lowing infections:
»
» Bronchiolitis: An inflammation of the bronchioles (lungs’ 
airways). Your child will have a nasty cough and may have 
trouble breathing. Take her to your pediatrician.
»
» Chickenpox: Starts with a fever and cold symptoms. After a 
day or two, your child gets red, itchy blisters on her skin. You 
can calm the itch with calamine lotion or other lotions 
available from your pharmacy and give your child lots of 
soothing baths. A vaccination is available to prevent your 
child getting chickenpox. Talk to your pediatrician about 
having her vaccinated. While chickenpox is generally mild 
and mostly annoying, in rare cases it can cause very serious 
and life-threatening complications.
»
» Croup: A cough caused by a viral infection. It starts out as a 
cold but becomes a pretty nasty and wheezy cough, similar 
to a barking seal’s, that comes on suddenly. Call your 
pediatrician. In rare cases, croup can interfere with your 
child’s breathing. Call 911 if he’s turning blue or is unable to 
catch his breath.
»
» Ear infection: If your child has an ear infection, she’ll be 
cranky and tug at her ears or rub them. A trip to your 

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      215
pediatrician to check your child’s ears thoroughly is in order. 
She may need antibiotics to treat the infection.
»
» Gastroenteritis: Most children have a “tummy bug” at some 
stage, which usually involves a lot of vomiting and diarrhea. 
A number of common viruses can be responsible for your 
child’s illness. Gastro bugs can cause dehydration, so make 
sure your child gets plenty to drink. Gastro bugs can take a 
week to disappear, but if you’re concerned, see your 
pediatrician, especially if your child can’t keep anything down 
and is running a fever.
»
» Strep throat: Your child may have a high temperature, tug 
at his throat, or act exhausted. Go to your pediatrician.
If you’re at all worried about how unwell your child is, take her to 
your pediatrician. Checking with a healthcare professional is best, 
especially if she’s running a temperature that doesn’t go down 
after giving her acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
To take care of a child with a fever (a temperature over  
100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), try the following:
»
» Give her a dose of children’s acetaminophen or ibuprofen 
suitable for her age.
»
» Keep her clothing light, and use only a sheet to cover her in bed.
»
» Give her lots of fluids.
»
» Keep her bedroom cool but not cold.
If her temperature stays high, or you’re worried about her illness, 
see your pediatrician. You know your child best, so if she seems 
not to be her usual self — for example, she’s less active, quiet, 
or sleepy — checking with your pediatrician is a good idea. In 
­general, look at the child, not the thermometer. The degree of 
fever isn’t always an indication of how sick a child is.
Safety update
Of course you’ve completely baby-proofed the house by now, as we 
suggest in Chapter 7, but there’s an issue to consider as your baby 
turns into a toddler to make sure he’s safe — the walking issue.

216      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Once toddlers find their feet, they’re off — and fast. Leaving the 
front door open may spell disaster, as your child can be out of the 
house and down to the road in seconds. You may want to invest 
in safety gates for stairs, making sure that back and front yards 
have toddler-proof fencing and that any rooms you don’t want 
junior visiting are closed off and out of bounds — at least until 
he can reach the door handle. Some parents find a playpen handy 
at this age, but be aware that an 18-month-old can learn pretty 
quickly how to get out of a playpen — and could hurt himself in 
the process.
In the first half of his second year, your little one will be canny 
enough to use other objects like chairs, boxes, and large toys 
to climb and get into cupboards, benches, and other places you 
assumed were out of reach.
Pay particular attention to your kitchen. Take knives off the 
­countertop. A curious toddler can work out how to grab pot han-
dles, so keep handles tucked in toward the stove and away from 
inquisitive little hands.
Conscious Fathering
As parents, you have the choice to find out and educate your-
selves about your children, or to not bother and rely on what 
you know from your own parents. While grandparents are a great 
EXPERIENCING FEBRILE SEIZURES
Few things are as frightening as watching your toddler have a febrile 
seizure — a seizure that occurs only when he runs a fever. Between  
2 and 5 percent of children under age 5 experience one or more 
febrile seizures. Most last only a few minutes and do not cause any 
lasting harm. Stay calm, turn your child on his side, and don’t try to 
force anything into his mouth. Call your pediatrician after to let her 
know. If your child turns blue or a seizure lasts 15 minutes without 
stopping, call 911.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      217
source of child-rearing information, things have changed in the 
last 20–30 years, and you will want to change with them.
You may have heard about conscious parenting, which means 
thinking about what sort of parent you want to be and what you 
want for your children. Conscious parenting is also about actively 
taking part in learning about how children are developing. So for 
guys, this means conscious fathering. We believe being active in 
your child’s life is important so you can understand and man-
age the different stages she’s going through, rather than being 
dumbfounded by her behavior.
Parents realize that learning to walk is a huge developmental 
achievement, but so is having a tantrum. Understanding what’s 
behind these developmental milestones makes all the difference. 
Reacting appropriately to your child’s behavior is much easier 
when you know what’s going on.
If you look at your toddler’s new tricks (especially the challeng-
ing behavior) from the point of view that this is a phase of her 
growth and development, managing the way your child behaves is 
much easier and less stressful for both of you. That said, the envi-
ronment and situation plays a big part in your toddler’s behav-
ior as well; for example, toddlers and young children act up and 
are difficult to manage when they’re tired, hungry, or in pain or 
­discomfort — just like most adults.
Children need
»
» Consistency and consequences
»
» Guidance and understanding
»
» Limits and boundaries
»
» Love and warmth
»
» A structured and secure environment
»
» To be talked to and listened to
Taking into account your child’s developmental stage and tem-
perament when you’re interacting with her is also important. 
Read on to find out about developmental stages for toddlers.

218      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Your toddler is learning that she has her own will and can assert 
herself. She’s a curious little creature who doesn’t know yet what 
the rules about living are, and she needs you to show her what her 
boundaries and limits are.
A Busy Year for Your Little One
Remember how much your child changed in the first year of life? 
She may have slowed her rapid rate of physical growth, but not 
her development. She’s speeding toward ever-increasing ­abilities, 
skills, and independence.
Toddler development
This year is characterized by your little one taking her first steps 
and speaking her first words, and by her social and emotional 
development. By the time she’s 2, she’ll be able to say about  
50 words, if not more.
At this time, she’s developing the following physical skills:
»
» Being able to see into the distance and spot things like the 
moon, planes, and birds in the sky
»
» Climbing objects like ladders, steps, and chairs to get higher, 
so watch that safety!
»
» Feeding herself with a spoon, then a fork, and then adding a 
dull knife to the equation, with much more dexterity and skill 
than before
»
» Making attempts to run, albeit with knocked-knees
»
» Performing little tasks such as “find Dad’s slippers”
»
» Stacking objects on top of each other, such as blocks and 
little chairs on tables
»
» Taking her clothes off and putting on some simple clothing, 
such as her hat and jacket
»
» Throwing and kicking a ball (however, catching is pretty 
advanced)

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      219
Her language skills are growing too. During this year, she’s 
­learning to
»
» Listen to and understand conversations
»
» Say approximately 50-plus words, although not clearly and 
perhaps not in coherent sentences, but rather like “Daddy 
gone” or “sock where?”
»
» Understand simple instructions
As for her social and mental development, you’ll find that she’s
»
» Able to feel jealous, and may object if you and your partner 
show affection for each other or if you’re close to other children.
»
» Able to remember things, and may talk about them or find 
things that she’s left somewhere (see Chapter 7 for more 
information about object permanence).
»
» Able to say “no” more often than you’d like and can be 
possessive of favorite toys.
»
» Excited by presents or events, or the anticipation of seeing 
someone special like grandparents.
»
» Incredibly curious and wants to be involved with everything 
that you’re doing.
»
» Involved for longer periods with specific toys. Tell her when 
you want to start a new activity, such as changing her diaper, 
because she may not object so loudly then.
If you announce what you’re going to do next or what you’d 
like your little man to do next, you’ll probably encounter less 
resistance. We all want to feel we’re in control (at least a little 
bit) and know what’s happening, and toddlers are no 
different, so comment on everything you’re doing and tell 
him what’s going to happen next.
»
» More interested in books, and will want you to read them 
over and over again. Repetition is good for children’s 
learning, so even if you’ve read her Goodnight Moon 500 
times already, just keep reading it if she asks. You may find 
she also knows the words by heart and will call you out if you 
skip phrases or pages.

220      PART 3  The Toddler Years
»
» Objecting to changes in her environment or activity. If she’s 
really enjoying playing with blocks, she may object to having 
a bath, even though she loves bathing.
»
» Perhaps afraid of dogs, water, heights, the dark, and all 
manner of things, including things she used to enjoy.
»
» Recognizing herself in a mirror, as well as family and friends 
in photos.
»
» Showing more determination to do things her way or the 
highway. She’s also showing her independence by refusing 
your help with tasks.
»
» Very attached to mom and dad, and gets upset if you leave 
her alone.
Playing with your child at this age is really fun. Unlike a baby, 
your toddler can make full use of playgrounds and go outside and 
explore the landscape, and you can really talk to each other! Here 
are some simple things you two can do together that he’ll really 
love and that will encourage the development of skills:
»
» Play with building blocks. They fascinate toddlers and help 
develop fine motor skills. Try making some towers or castles 
together.
»
» Get outdoors. Climb a tree together, get on your bikes, or 
head to the park or playground.
»
» Let the music play. Some toddlers really love listening to 
music and dancing. He wants to do everything you’re doing, 
so dance along with him. It doesn’t matter if the neighbors 
see you.
»
» Let your toddler explore. If he gets into your closet and tries 
on your shoes, let him go for it! What harm can it do? He may 
just learn the motor skills to put on his own shoes.
»
» Play chase around the house. Stay just a little bit out of his 
reach so he has to catch you.
»
» Play in the sandbox. Sandbox play helps your toddler 
develop fine motor skills and dexterity, as well as experience 
sand running through his fingers.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      221
»
» Play with water. Toddlers love pouring water into objects, so 
if you’re washing the dishes, he can “help” by standing on a 
chair at the sink with you and pouring water from one cup to 
another.
»
» Read stories together, sometimes dozens of times over. You 
can change things a bit by reading the story in a silly voice or 
asking your child questions about what’s on each page as 
you go along.
»
» Roll around on the floor together. This helps with your 
toddler’s sense of balance and prepares him for rough and 
tumble play when he gets a bit older.
Toddlers can get pretty excited when rough-housing or playing 
and forget themselves, so you and mom need to set some rules 
around play. Some suggestions include no throwing balls in the 
house, no hitting, and no snatching toys from other children. 
However, children don’t fully understand the concept of sharing 
and inflicting pain until they are much older, so they will still 
snatch toys and hit other children.
Be patient and consistent. When things get a bit out of hand around 
the playground, remove your child from the scene, ­distract him, 
or give him a cuddle as a simple intervention.
Talk about everything that you and your little one are doing. His 
mind is a sponge, and he’ll soak up every word.
Say “daddy”
Hearing your child talk for the first time is like your cat suddenly 
speaking to you. For the whole of your child’s life he’s done noth-
ing but coo and babble and cry, and then voilà! Words! Some of the 
first words he’ll say won’t sound like much until a light goes on 
in your head and you recognize “ball” or “truck” or “dog” — an 
amazing moment.
Communicating is more than just about words and speech; it’s 
about body language, gestures, and the tone of your voice when 
you speak, which is how you can help your toddler connect ideas 
with spoken words. For example, the way you say “hot!” in a sharp 
tone indicates to your child that hot things are to be avoided, and 

222      PART 3  The Toddler Years
the way you say “good boy!” with applause and a kiss helps to 
connect those words with good feelings.
Toddlers understand pointing, gestures, and tone before they 
understand words, so you can help expand your little one’s lan-
guage by connecting those things with words. Try to describe 
what you’re doing so he connects that action with the words 
you’re saying.
Unlike when you tried to learn a language at school, picking up 
language is really easy for young children. All your child really 
needs is lots of talking from you and help to connect ideas, like 
pictures in books, and actions, like getting dressed, with words in 
order to get those language synapses firing.
Toddlers typically go through a word spurt from 18 months onward, 
where they may learn a word from hearing it only once. Children 
who have been through their word spurts already can deduce or 
fast map what the word for a particular object is by eliminating 
objects they already know. Show your child three animals, such as 
a duck, a lion, and an animal he has never seen before. Ask him 
which is the duck, which is the lion, and which is the aardvark, 
and he’ll be able to pick the aardvark because it’s the animal he 
doesn’t know.
Enthusiasm is infectious. If you’re talking about how gorgeous 
your little petal is or how well she’s put away her toys, your tone 
communicates how you feel about her, and that’s what will hold 
her attention and motivate her to work out what you’re saying.
Repetition of words and phrases is important, so keep pointing at 
the rabbit picture and saying “rabbit.” Any day now you’ll hear 
your toddler mumble “wabbit” when you point at the picture.
As we mention in Chapter 7, keep exposing your child to different 
languages if you can. This exposure helps his pronunciation later 
in life, and he will also enjoy hearing different words that describe 
the same thing. If you don’t know any other language, learn a few 
words for common items — many kids’ shows are great for this — 
and throw them into the conversation now and then.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      223
Dad, I need to pee
Toilet training is a subject close to the heart of many fathers — 
those who are cheering for an end to diaper changing and those 
who can’t bear the thought of having to clean poop out of the 
carpet again.
Toilet training is another of those sticks that people measure their 
children’s success by. Most children are diaper free by 18 months 
to 4 years old. Some parents may brag that little Jimmy was toi-
let trained by 2 years as if that’s some mark of his genius, but 
some perfectly normal, bright children aren’t ready to go potty by 
themselves until they’re 4.
Try not to get too hung up about toilet training by a certain age. 
Like other milestones, such as rolling over and walking, your 
child will toilet train when she’s ready. You can lead her to the 
toilet, but you can’t make her pee.
You know your toddler is ready to give the toilet a go when
»
» She’s interested in watching you go to the toilet yourself.
»
» She has dry diapers for a couple of hours or more. This 
shows she can “save up” urine in her bladder.
»
» She has the language skills to tell you she has soiled or wet 
her diaper, or can tell you she wants to pee or poop.
»
» She starts to dislike wearing a diaper and tries to take it off.
»
» She can pull up and pull down her pants or tights.
»
» She can walk steadily and sit long enough to urinate or have 
a BM.
»
» Her bowel movements are soft, well formed, and fairly 
predictable.
Your child doesn’t need to demonstrate all these signs to show 
he’s ready to toilet train. Like starting solids, starting toilet train-
ing is something you can judge and try out. If it doesn’t work, just 
wait and try again when more signs pop up.

224      PART 3  The Toddler Years
In France, parents believe you shouldn’t start toilet training 
before the child can walk up and down stairs upright and unas-
sisted. Apparently this means the child’s muscles are ready to 
control bowel movements. See if it works for you!
Some tips for starting toilet training are as follows:
»
» Choose a settled time in your child’s life to begin toilet 
training, not the week your parents are coming to stay or 
when he’s due for immunizations.
»
» If your child has a regular routine, find a time to try the potty 
that can become part of that routine.
»
» Be prepared for toilet training to take a few months. Have 
patience if things go backward. There will be setbacks, but 
like everything, setbacks are just a phase. If toilet training 
isn’t working after three months, stop and wait a month or 
so until giving it another shot.
»
» If she’s watching you use the toilet, tell her what you’re doing.
»
» Let her push the button to make the toilet flush to reduce 
the fear that comes when she hears the flush.
»
» Go slowly. Don’t expect her to be dry at night for a while 
after she has gotten the hang of the toilet in the daytime. 
There will be daytime accidents too, so be a patient dad.
»
» Encourage her to eat fruit and drink fluid to avoid constipation.
Forcing your child to toilet train when you want her to is bound to 
fail. Let her guide you to when she’s ready developmentally to go 
to the toilet. And having a potty-trained kid doesn’t always make 
your life simpler. You can be sure he’ll need to visit every rest-
room in every big box store you go into for the next year or two.
Here’s how to start toilet training:
»
» Get a plastic potty or a toilet trainer that sits on the toilet 
seat or on the floor. One that sits on the floor is easier for 
most children to manage.
»
» At a specific time of day when you think junior needs to go, 
put her on the potty with her clothes on so she can get a feel 
for the potty.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      225
»
» When she’s used to being on the potty each day, try it with 
her diaper off.
»
» Change to training pants or a combination of training pants 
and diapers for nighttime. Training pants are designed so 
that junior feels wet. The idea is to help your toddler develop 
a cause–effect link between a wet diaper and the muscles in 
her body that are responsible for urinating or having a BM.
»
» Give a big cheer when she produces anything at all in the 
toilet or potty.
Don’t forget to show your little one how to wash and dry her 
hands after using the toilet — may as well start developing good 
habits now.
Can we play football yet?
Any father knows that the possibilities for playing with your tod-
dler open up dramatically once he’s mobile. As he develops his 
throwing, kicking, and running, you may be tempted to see him 
as the next rising star in soccer or football or whatever you’re into. 
That’s great, as long as you don’t pressure your child to perform.
The idea that toddlers, not known for their teamwork or sharing, 
can play team sports seems a little ridiculous at first glance, but 
not so. Creating structure, rules, and team spirit is a great way to 
introduce your child to sports, not to mention an awesome way to 
burn off excess energy. And sports are yet another way to encour-
age some dad-time with your child by giving him encouragement, 
helping out with practice, or even coaching.
Playing in team sports is important because
»
» Children this age love to be around other kids, and being in a 
group helps them socialize and develop interpersonal skills.
»
» It encourages your child from an early age to participate in 
physical activities and learn a skill with other children his age.
»
» It helps develop gross motor skills such as throwing and 
kicking.

226      PART 3  The Toddler Years
It’s All about Me, Dad!
The newborn who didn’t recognize himself in the mirror and had no 
idea he even had hands has left the building. Your toddler not only 
knows who he is, but thinks he’s the only kid on the block and acts 
like nothing else matters — not the instructions you give him or 
the cat he’s chasing. Now is the time to get serious about discipline.
Understanding discipline
Toddlers don’t know the rules to the game of life yet, so you dads 
and your partners need to teach the rules to your children. Another 
word for this is discipline. Discipline’s not about laying down the 
law and punishing your child when he doesn’t conform, but about 
giving your kids the tools to know what’s right and wrong and 
helping them on the way to becoming independent young people. 
Developing a warm, loving relationship with your child where he 
feels safe and secure with you is the best place to start, because 
he’ll know you’re always there for him and love him, even when 
he’s just painted his room with toothpaste.
Children need boundaries and limits so they know where they 
stand and know the consequences of crossing those lines. Chil-
dren are challenging in the respect that part of their nature is to 
push those boundaries.
Here are some tips for making discipline work:
»
» Be consistent with your boundaries. If snatching a toy from a 
friend is not okay one day, but okay the next, junior will be 
confused. He needs to know from day one that snatching’s 
not okay. At the same time, giving warmth, talking, guidance, 
and encouragement so he doesn’t feel alienated as a result 
of his behavior is also important. Time-outs and more drastic 
consequences are more appropriate with slightly older 
children, such as preschoolers.
»
» Be realistic about what your child can do. Children can’t do 
everything perfectly right away and can’t control their 
emotions or understand their bodies the way adults do. We 
get grumpy when we’re hungry or tired, and so do children, 
but children don’t know how to control those emotions yet.

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      227
»
» Model the behavior you want to see in your children. If your 
son sees you punching the wall when you’re annoyed, in all 
likelihood he’ll repeat that behavior when he’s annoyed. 
Saying you’re sorry to your toddler encourages him to say it 
too when he needs to.
»
» Communicate with your toddler, even if she isn’t really 
speaking well yet. It may take a few explanations to show her 
the rules, but she’ll get there. You don’t need to give 
complicated explanations for why hitting the cat is not okay. 
Simply telling her he may scratch is enough.
»
» Try to be patient with your child. It takes time for toddlers to 
learn their boundaries and to understand consequences.
»
» Kids aren’t naughty for the sake of it, or to wind you up. 
There’s usually a reason. Your toddler is trying out new 
things every second of the day, like throwing bits of banana 
around the car, for the experience of it. She may also be less 
well behaved when she’s tired or hungry, frustrated, or shy. 
Work with your child’s routine: Don’t go shopping at 
lunchtime or to a busy, crowded place at nap time.
»
» Remember that your child just wants you to love her and to 
please you, which may be hard to do on a day when she’s 
thrown bits of banana around the car. Be patient and use 
distraction to divert her attention while removing the banana 
from sight.
»
» Reward good behavior with lots of love and praise, but try 
not to withhold love when she’s behaving badly. Let her 
know you love her (the little person), not the behavior.
»
» Say more positive than negative things to your child. Reword 
phrases; for example, “no running in the house” becomes 
“slow down, please.”
»
» You and your partner need to work out what action to take 
when junior is doing something undesirable. Think about the 
“naughty step.” Distracting your child from a behavior, 
showing her how to clean up if she’s made a mess, or taking 
away a toy that’s being fought over are all techniques to 
discipline a child. Smacking a child, in our opinion, is not 
acceptable. Smacking has been found to be ineffective in 
changing behavior, and it confuses children: How can dad 
love me when he hits me?

228      PART 3  The Toddler Years
We recommend using a framework for effective discipline that 
starts before any issues arise. It goes like this:
»
» Be consistent and explain consequences.
»
» Establish limits and boundaries.
»
» Guide and understand him.
»
» Show love and warmth to your child at every opportunity.
»
» Talk and listen to him frequently.
The result will be a structured and secure environment to grow 
up in.
If your child is really pushing your buttons with his behavior, 
yelling at him won’t make things any easier. In fact, it may just 
make things worse. So try to be calm, take a deep breath, and sing 
a song, like “Itsy Bitsy Spider,” to yourself.
When you feel yourself getting really wound up, check how you’re 
feeling and what your day has been like. It may be that the behav-
ior of your little one isn’t actually that bad; you’ve just had a 
tough day. It may be a good idea to remove yourself from the 
situation to let off some steam, or lift your spirits by listening to 
a good song in the car.
Understand the difference between discipline and punishment. 
Discipline is derived from “disciple” and refers to a particular code 
of conduct given to a person to follow. Punishment is the prac-
tice of imposing something unpleasant or aversive on somebody. 
Punishment doesn’t involve any instruction or code of conduct, 
and as a result, it is typically not effective in changing behavior. 
Use discipline with your children rather than punishment.
Tantrums, biting, and hitting
When you first met your seconds-old baby all those months ago, 
you probably didn’t imagine that she’d be having a full-on hissy 
fit in the middle of the supermarket over not being able to grab a 
bottle of bleach from the shelf. But it happens to even the ­nicest 
babies, with the nicest, most nurturing parents. Not only do 
­children have tantrums, but they hit other children (or you), pull 

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      229
hair, bite, and scratch because they aren’t yet able to control their 
emotions, frustrations, and physicality.
Tantrums
Although 2-year-olds are infamous for being tempestuous, even 
children under 2 have tantrums. Tantrums can go on into the fifth 
year and beyond. You’ve probably seen a child mid-tantrum in the 
street or shop, with an embarrassed, stressed-out parent stand-
ing nearby, trying to reason her little one out of it or ignore the 
whole thing. You probably said that your kid would never do that. 
But tantrums are almost inevitable.
Tantrums happen when your child is overloaded with stress or 
frustration. He has an idea of what he wants to do, such as ­running 
around like a crazy thing in the supermarket. If you want him to 
do otherwise, such as staying by your side as you shop, he’s going 
to get pretty fed up with you holding him back and have a tantrum.
He may also be tired and hungry, or feeling vulnerable or inse-
cure, which makes all people’s tolerance for things they don’t 
want to do much lower, even you big, grown-up fathers.
Here are some pointers on how to stop tantrums happening:
»
» Make sure junior isn’t tired or hungry before setting out on 
an activity.
»
» Talk to your child about what you’re going to be doing or 
who you’ll be seeing so there aren’t surprises for him.
»
» If you’re at the playground and it’s nearly time to leave, let 
him have plenty of time to get used to the idea, so he 
understands when it’s time to go.
»
» Get your child involved in what you’re doing so he’s engaged 
with you rather than wanting to behave in a way that 
requires you telling him off.
If a tantrum is on its way, the best strategy is to ignore it. Keep 
close by to make sure your little one doesn’t feel completely 
abandoned by you, but understand that trying to reason with or 
­distract him is usually pointless. Just let him get it all out, and 
when the tantrum’s over, give him a hug and a kiss and keep on 

230      PART 3  The Toddler Years
with what you were doing. Don’t get upset, as that usually just 
intensifies the tantrum. Keep breathing!
Talk to your partner about how you plan to manage tantrums 
and activities that may involve tantrums, like shopping, long car 
rides, or visiting people. Consistency is important in helping your 
toddler grow up, so the two of you need a consistent approach to 
handle tantrums or discipline in general.
Hurting others
Having your child come home from day care with a bite mark or 
scratches on her face is horrifying. Finding out that your child’s 
the person doing the biting and scratching is also horrifying.
Your toddler hasn’t gotten the hang of empathy (the ability to 
feel how others are feeling) yet, and hitting someone else hasn’t 
­registered on her list of things on the “not okay” list. Hurting 
others is often a sign of some underlying emotion, such as anger, 
fear, insecurity, or frustration. By finding out what is behind this 
behavior, you can address the problem directly and let her know 
plainly that hurting another person is never okay. Your little one 
doesn’t necessarily grasp that her hitting or biting hurts the other 
person. Empathy is a complex concept that most children master 
only when they are around 5 years or older.
Labeling your child as a “biter” or “hitter” leads to more biting 
and hitting. Your child is a person, not a behavior.
Here’s how you can deal with your child hitting or scratching 
another child:
»
» Acknowledge how your child is feeling — “I know you’re 
angry . . .”
»
» Explain that’s not how you deal with problems — “We don’t 
hit people when we’re angry. Hitting hurts people.”
»
» Give her an alternative for dealing with her anger, such as 
stomping her feet.
»
» Show her how to touch people with kindness rather than anger.
Bear in mind that your child is still pretty young. It may be that 
all the behavior management is a bit too overwhelming for her 

CHAPTER 10  Toddling Toward Two: Months 12–24      231
at present, so try again in a few months. Be patient and gentle, 
and keep showing her a better way to handle conflict or frustra-
tion. This is another area where you can be a shining example as 
a dad — show her how it’s done.
Sharing — what a nice idea
Toddlers are territorial creatures whose favorite word after “no!” is 
“mine!” Your sweet little boy doesn’t yet understand the feelings 
of others and thinks only about himself. Sounds awful, but it’s true.
Even kids who are best buddies at day care or cousins who adore 
each other’s company will fight over possession of a favored toy 
and lay claim to what they think is theirs. Play dates, playgroups, 
and child care can be rife with conflict. This conflict is all part 
of your toddler becoming independent and learning he has some 
control over the universe.
But if you want to stop your child from turning out like Veruca 
Salt from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, teach him how to share. 
Hearing your 3-year-old tell you “we’re sharing” and knowing 
your good fathering got him there is amazing.
Here are some ways to help your child become the sharing type:
»
» Make it clear that not sharing, such as snatching a toy away or 
hogging a toy that another child wants, is not okay. Even if your 
child owns the toy, snatching the toy from another is not okay.
»
» Praise your child whenever she gives a toy to another child 
and reinforce the behavior with “good sharing!”
»
» Step in if your child and another child are tussling over a 
favored toy. Explain that when you share, you take turns playing 
with something. Give the toy back to whoever had it first.
»
» Show your child how both she and a playmate can use or 
play with the toy together.
If you’re hosting a play date, don’t make it too long. An hour or 
two is long enough. Make sure you keep both children topped 
up with food and drink. Being hungry or thirsty can make them 
grumpy and less likely to play nicely.

232      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Sharing is also a complex concept that most children don’t fully 
grasp until they’re much older (around 5 or 6 years old). However, 
explaining sharing to your little one from an early stage is still 
important. Patience is required, but eventually she’ll understand 
why sharing is a useful concept.
Setbacks
Dealing with setbacks is a part of fatherhood. All great fathers 
have setbacks. Your little angel has been glorious company for a 
week, but one day you come home from work to find he’s trans-
formed into a monster, ignoring everything you tell him and 
chasing the cat like crazy. Letting fly with a few choice words may 
be easy but won’t help anyone.
You’ll almost certainly have to face a few setbacks on your father-
hood journey. Maybe setbacks are nature’s way of keeping life 
interesting for parents, or perhaps every so often children have to 
take a step back to make two steps forward while they’re devel-
oping. In most cases there don’t seem to be any logical explana-
tions for why setbacks occur, so you have to take them as they 
come. Stick with your parenting approach and don’t be distracted 
by temporary setbacks.
These strategies can help:
»
» Be consistent with your discipline.
»
» Divert the energy of the annoying activity to something else 
that can be more easily managed, such as introducing a 
different toy, game, or rule.
»
» Keep your cool. Take some deep breaths. Think of Monty 
Python’s “Always look on the bright side of life” and see the 
funny side of it. Walk outside if you need to.
You’re always going to have setbacks — they’re part of being a 
father. Your child, even though he’s acting like a demon, really 
only wants to be loved and to make you happy. Try to remember 
that when he’s smearing jam on your suit jacket.

H
aving your child turn 2 is quite a milestone for a lot of 
dads — you’ve put some serious miles between now and 
when you first met your baby. Now that your little one is 
2 years old, he’s no longer an infant, but a fully fledged toddler. 
At  the end of this year when he’s 3, he’ll graduate from tod­
dlerhood and become a preschooler. Your little tyke may have 
been through a whole lot of firsts in these two years — first smile, 
first step, first word — but the experience of being a dad just gets 
­better. Now you can kick a ball around, have real conversations, 
and share your first joke together at mom’s expense.
Two is also a challenging age. Junior’s getting some strong opin­
ions about things and won’t hesitate to tell you about them, 
although the only expression he knows for “I’m not very fond of 
this” may be very similar to a full-on scream. Tantrums can also 
really come to the fore this year.

234      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Luckily for you, in this chapter we’re here with tips for talking to 
your toddler in ways that may bypass the whole tantrum situation, 
encouraging his interests with play indoors and out, and keep­
ing on top of discipline. We also look at the possibility of starting 
nursery school and changing your work to fit your new lifestyle.
Exploring the World with Dad
Your toddler is quickly getting better on her feet and really comes 
alive in terms of her physical ability around 2 years old. She’ll be 
up for more sliding, swinging, bike riding, and more of everything 
physical. This increased physical ability is great, because it’s good 
for her learning and good for dads to do something other than 
shake rattles and stumble through nursery rhymes.
Helping your toddler grow up
You can have all the DVDs in the world to teach your toddler this 
and that, but what really gets a little person’s brain going is con­
tact with other people, most importantly his parents. ­Children 
learn best from direct contact with other human beings. The 
closer the relationship with the person they’re learning from, the 
better they pick up new skills.
Even though junior’s vocabulary is expanding by leaps and 
bounds, he’s still got a long way to go with his development. 
­Children need stimulation to grow and learn, and the first place 
they look for stimulation is with parents. Keep challenging your 
little one to try new things out — even though you may think he’s 
not capable yet, let him try a new skill. Learning is about taking 
risks (within reason) and being challenged.
Everything you do around the house is an opportunity to learn. 
Even washing the dishes can turn into a chance for your toddler to 
practice pouring water and wiping down the counters, two sim­
ple activities he may be interested in and feel really good about 
when he masters them. You may find you have a budding chef in 
the house if you involve him in making his own lunch or getting 
­dinner ready in the evening. Kids this age love having little tasks 

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      235
to do and want to contribute, so let them, even if they make a bit 
of a mess at times.
When your child is struggling with a task or activity, try to hang 
back and see what happens rather than stepping in to do it for her. 
Moms are (generally) guiltier of this than dads, but some dads 
are also just too quick to step in to help. If you’re always step­
ping in, you deprive your child of the chance to figure things out 
for herself and overcome obstacles, and enjoy the confidence and 
self-esteem that working out obstacles brings.
Developing skills and confidence
The third year of your child’s life is another whirlwind of 
­development. If the second year was all about finding her feet, the 
third year is about finding her voice, and she will — usually in a 
shopping mall or other public place, yelling “No no no” at you, 
but that’s another topic. Her language skills are growing daily and 
so are her physical, emotional, social, and cognitive skills. You 
can help develop her skills by
»
» Challenging: Every day, give your child an opportunity to 
dress herself, walk up steps by herself, wash her own face, 
and take other little steps toward being independent. Of 
course you can’t expect her to master all these skills, but 
cheering on the progress she makes each day gives her the 
confidence to keep trying. Not long from now she’ll be telling 
you she can do it all by herself, thank you very much.
»
» Drawing: Your toddler’s fine motor skills are at work when 
she draws pictures, or rather, scribbles. And there’s nothing 
to stop you from joining in. You can have little draw-offs with 
your child, where you challenge her to draw something for 
you and in return you draw something for her. Get your child 
to explain what her pictures are about, rather than giving 
empty praise for her work. Ask lots of questions about what 
she’s drawing and repeat back to her in your own words 
what you’re looking at; for example, “Okay, I can see a house, 
a cat, and a dog” (which will probably look like three circles 
on paper at this stage). Remember — the accuracy of her 
drawing doesn’t matter; the effort and her explanations are 
what count.

236      PART 3  The Toddler Years
»
» Hanging out: If your child doesn’t go to day care, you’ll need 
to arrange some social situations for her to meet other 
children and play with them. This helps your child learn 
about sharing, cooperating, and language. She’ll also see 
other people her age. See Chapter 9 for information about 
playgroups and Chapter 10 for tips on handling toddlers’ 
interaction.
»
» Making stuff: How many cereal boxes did you believe were 
rocket ships when you were a kid? Resurrect your imagina-
tion (that thing you gave up when you became an adult), and 
use it to help your child create all sorts of toys and playthings 
from everyday objects. See the section “Fun and games” later 
in this chapter for some ideas.
»
» Reading: You can’t read too much to a young child. Bringing 
your enthusiasm for reading to each story session encour-
ages a love of words; stimulates your child’s interest in the 
topic being read about; and creates a warm, secure bond 
between the two of you. While your toddler wants you to 
read the same story over and over, mix it up a bit with 
different authors, styles, and topics that challenge her. Buying 
every Thomas the Tank Engine title — and nothing else — isn’t 
giving your child variety.
»
» Talking: Your toddler learns her language from hearing you 
talk to her. Though she hasn’t mastered getting her lips, 
mouth, and tongue to do exactly what adults can do, she’s 
on her way. Table 11-1 provides a guide to your toddler’s 
speech development for her age. See www.children.gov.
on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/earlychildhood/
speechlanguage/brochure_speech.aspx for more on 
developmental milestones for children’s speech.
»
» Waiting: Like time, toddlers wait for no man — or anything 
else. Patience doesn’t come naturally, so provide examples 
of good things that take time, such as cooking food in the 
oven, or planting seeds and keeping tabs on their growth. 
Doing jigsaw puzzles is another excellent way to help her 
develop patience and persistence to complete a task.

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      237
Try not to get too hung up on having little Jimmy recite the 
­alphabet or count to 100. Memorizing isn’t the same as actually 
understanding. You’ll have plenty of time for rote memorization 
when he gets closer to school age.
Lots of genuine praise when your toddler does something 
­awesome, like trying to say a new word when you point at a pic­
ture, or completing an activity like putting her cup on the bench, 
builds her self-confidence.

238      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Fun and games
Here are some more ideas for playing and having fun with your 
little one:
»
» Go camping in your living room. If you’ve got a tent, you 
can set it up in your living room and fill it with pillows, toys, 
and sleeping bags. Snuggle up, sing songs, watch some fun 
movies, and eat some junk food. Skip the campfire, though. 
If you don’t have a tent, organize a large cardboard box 
(a supermarket, retail store, or furniture shop may be able 
to provide you with one) and make a little house out of it.
»
» Make a roll-around bottle together. Cut two big plastic drink 
bottles in half and use the top end of each. Put some interesting 
shapes inside and thread a shoelace through the bottle tops on 
either end. Seal the middle with tape. Knot the shoelaces 
together to make a line that your toddler can drag around.
»
» Make lunch. Toddlers love to help and seem especially 
drawn to helping out in the kitchen. If you get your toddler 
his own stool or box to stand on so he can reach the 
countertop, he can help with simple tasks like peeling boiled 
eggs and stirring ingredients with a spoon.
»
» Create an obstacle course. Make tunnels by placing a 
blanket over the tops of two chairs with their backs facing 
each other. Add other elements with low tables to crawl 
under, stairs to climb, and boxes to climb over. You can buy 
commercial plastic tunnels, but why, when you can make 
your own and change it from day to day?
»
» Get dizzy. Have your toddler hold onto a towel and spin it 
around on a slippery floor slowly so that he doesn’t fall. You 
can also try sitting in a spinning chair like an office chair with 
junior on your lap whizzing around and around. Kids love 
to get dizzy — you, maybe not so much, but this is what 
parental sacrifices are all about. These activities help your 
toddler’s balance.
»
» Play chase. Toddlers love being chased, peeking through 
curtains, and a bit of rough and tumble play when they’re 
caught. Just don’t go overboard on the rough stuff, and stop 
if your kiddo is more scared than having a good time.

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      239
»
» Sing! There are so many great children’s songs and nursery 
rhymes. Little ones really love songs with hand actions like 
“This Old Man” or “Itsy Bitsy Spider.”
Some words for worried moms
If your partner has a seriously worried look on her face while 
watching you tumble around with the little one, talk to her about 
rough and tumble play (she can even look it up on the Internet — 
rough and tumble play is a well-known concept of child play). 
Dad’s natural way to engage with his child is often to challenge 
him physically and “play a little rough” — at least by mom’s 
standards. There’s nothing wrong with this as long as junior 
still has a smile on his face and is squealing with delight. In fact, 
rough and tumble play is good for kids — it develops their social 
and physical skills, uses their imaginations, and introduces the 
ideas of good and bad, justice and courage. Just make sure no one 
gets too squished in a rough-housing session, and explain it to 
mom so she’s comfortable. And by the way . . . why not ask mom 
to join in? This is not the place to work out any relationship frus­
trations you’re having at the moment, however.
You’ve Created a Genius
Your child’s brain is constantly developing, and rapidly. Some 
areas are coming along faster than others. Speaking and motor 
skills are getting up there, while emotional and social skills 
develop fully further down the line and over a long period.
Development update
As your child grows, the things he’s capable of doing change, 
along with his behavior. As great dads, you really need to know 
about your child’s development so you understand his behavior 
and interests and know how to respond to them.

240      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Between the ages of 2 and 3, your child
»
» Can feed himself, remove and put on clothing, and undo 
zippers and large buttons
»
» Can remember people, places, and stories
»
» Enjoys creating things
»
» Has a sense of ownership over his toys and belongings, 
saying things like “mine!”
»
» Is able to use two- to three-word sentences, ask questions, 
and follow an instruction with two steps
»
» Is confident enough on his feet to try running, jumping, and 
hopping
»
» Is developing a sense of humor
»
» Likes to pretend to be someone else
»
» Knows his full name and gender
»
» Matches objects, such as shoes and animal pictures
The way your toddler behaves is part of his growing up. One of the 
fundamental aspects of disciplining your child is to have realistic 
expectations of what he can and can’t do. At 2 years old, he can’t 
manage his emotions well, express how he feels, or remember 
all the rules. Consequently during this stage you need to ­muster 
some extra patience. He’ll get there in his own time!
Giving your toddler choices
Getting tired of saying “no” yet? No, you can’t open that cup­
board! No, you can’t go outside. Saying no all the time gets boring, 
doesn’t it? Imagine what it sounds like to your toddler, hearing 
that all day long.
The answer to avoiding being stuck in the “no” loop is choices. 
Junior wants to go outside but it’s pouring rain? Instead of ­saying 
no, offer him a couple of other activities he can do inside, like 
drawing with crayons or building with some blocks or snap-
together models. Tell him, “We can’t go outside because it’s rain­
ing, but we can draw.” Offering your child a couple of things to 

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      241
choose from means you still have some control over what he does, 
but he also feels like he has some say in his life.
Distracting your child by giving him something else to do instead 
of the thing he can’t do is a great technique for stopping the no’s.
Say your toddler is pulling out clothes from the dresser to put 
on in the morning. Instead of saying no to the nightshirt he 
wants to wear to nursery school that day, give him the option of a 
green shirt or a blue one. He’ll feel like you take his opinions into 
account and will be more receptive to putting on a shirt. Less is 
more when it comes to giving a toddler choices.
Giving your child a choice also works with eating. Instead of ­plying 
your toddler with lots of vegetables, give him a choice: Broccoli 
or carrots? He may even end up eating both. Also, not forcing a 
decision helps. Sometimes you can simply say “I’ll do something 
else while you make up your mind whether you’d like broccoli or 
carrots.” In some cases your little champ might start eating one 
of the choices when you’re not looking — after all, he’s hungry.
At bedtime, letting your child choose a couple of stories before bed 
gets him interested in the idea of stories and what he wants to 
hear, rather than having him focus on resisting bedtime.
Setting boundaries and  
rules to match
Imagine you’ve landed on planet Wafunkle and you have no idea 
about the local etiquette, the way people talk to each other, what 
the customs are, or the way people live. You don’t know whether 
smiling is considered rude or doing underarm farts is a way of 
showing appreciation. You also don’t speak the language well, so 
the best you can do is bumble around, trying things out and being 
shown the rules until you get the hang of things.
This is the situation your toddler finds himself in right now. He 
doesn’t know that wrenching your glasses off your face is wrong 
or that sticking a knife in an electric socket is dangerous. He needs 
a guide to show him through the sometimes confusing maze that 
is modern life and society. And that guide is you. The method 
by which you guide him through that maze is called discipline. 

242      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Discipline’s about showing him the rules and having patience and 
strategies to help the rules stick.
Discipline isn’t about punishment, but about guiding your child to 
learn what the boundaries and rules in life are. You and your part­
ner decide what the rules are depending on your personal beliefs, 
morals, and way of life. Discipline is about finding a ­balance 
between letting your child run wild exploring things that can be 
dangerous for her or inappropriate, like hitting and biting, and 
not letting her try anything out and hindering her ability to learn.
Here are some ideas for rules and boundaries you may want to 
instill in your child:
»
» After two stories, it’s into bed.
»
» No going outside without dad or mom.
»
» Plugs and appliances are off limits.
»
» We’re gentle to animals and other people.
»
» We don’t scream or throw balls in the house.
»
» When we’re upset we use our words rather than our bodies 
to express how we feel.
»
» When we make a mistake or hurt someone, we say sorry.
»
» When we ask for something we say please, and when 
someone is nice to us we say thank you.
You may also like to come up with some rules and boundaries for 
yourself as a dad, including all of the preceding and a few more.
Be consistent with your rules and boundaries. Although you’ve 
told your little princess not to draw on the walls with crayon but 
only on paper and she keeps drawing on the walls, she’ll under­
stand and get the idea one day, so hang in there.
Some parents like to use a strategy called time out when their child 
pushes the rules, such as refusing to say sorry when she’s hurt 
another child or snatched a toy. This means removing her from 
the situation and putting her in a designated time-out area, like 
a corner or her room, for one minute per year of her age. Most 
toddlers won’t stay put, but it breaks the cycle or tantrum that’s 

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      243
about to erupt and lets them know in a nonviolent way that their 
behavior isn’t okay.
Telling your child for the millionth time not to run out onto the 
road can push your buttons, and make you angry and frustrated 
that the message isn’t getting through. However scared and 
angry you are, hitting your child isn’t the way to deal with it. Find 
another way to deal with your frustration — take a couple of deep 
breaths and make a mental note to use your favorite way to let off 
some steam later on. When you raise your voice to say “STOP” (as 
she’s about to run onto the street), give her a hug afterward and 
explain to her why running onto the road isn’t okay. The message 
will get through!
A key aspect of effective discipline is consistency and appropriate­
ness of your behavior management to your child’s developmen­
tal stage and temperament. The older your child gets, the more 
you can use rational arguments, rules, and consequences. So keep 
talking to your child about the same rules, outline consequences, 
stick to your rules, and follow through with consequences.
Stimulating your toddler’s 
­interests
Every child is different, and different things will catch his eye. 
One thing that all children have in common is their interest in 
playing. If you notice your toddler doing something over and over, 
he’s exploring a new concept and he can become almost obsessive 
about it. Child-care professionals usually refer to this behavior as 
a schema. Your child may pour water from one cup to another cup 
over and over, or paint a picture and then cover the whole thing 
in black paint, or cut up everything he can get his hands on. These 
are different types of schemas.
Some kinds of schemas can be destructive or against the bound­
aries you’ve set for your child and household, such as flicking the 
light switches up and down again and again. From your child’s 
perspective, he’s exploring a vertical schema. If your champ tears 
pieces of tissue into little pieces, he’s exploring a separation 
schema.

244      PART 3  The Toddler Years
If you aren’t happy with the way he’s exploring a particular 
schema, try to offer another way he can explore it. For example, 
get together a box of things he’s allowed to rip up or cut (with 
your supervision, of course), or encourage him to explore verti­
cal schema by bouncing on a trampoline or drawing. You could 
also demonstrate your DIY skills in front of your child by making 
a board of old switches (which aren’t connected to an electrical 
source) so your little one can safely flick switches all day.
You may also like to take an interest in the things he seems to 
really enjoy playing with, like a Lego project he’s been plug­
ging away at, or a favorite set of shoes he’s been trying on, and 
have these at the ready for when you need to offer your child a 
­tantrum-distracting choice.
Talking to your child  
so he understands
Sometimes it feels as if you’re beating your head against a wall 
as you try to communicate with your toddler. She won’t listen, 
you get angry, and both of you end up frustrated and in a worse 
spot than you were before. Take heart — here are some techniques 
you can use now that will help build good, open communication 
between the two of you as your little one grows:
»
» Acknowledge how she feels. You can easily walk all over 
your little one’s objections or opinions with your words when 
you’re talking to her. As fathers, with all good intentions, you 
frequently think you know best. When your child falls over 
and cries, you say things like “Oh, it doesn’t hurt.” You may 
offer a hug and some comfort, but your words are denying 
the way your child feels. Kids need to have their feelings 
acknowledged, just like adults do. By denying your child’s 
feelings, you’re kind of setting yourself up against her, rather 
than encouraging her to open up and find solutions. When 
your child is upset about something, rather than offer advice 
or a phrase to downplay her feelings, say something obvious 
like “You’re upset,” or agree with her by saying “Oh really?” 
and let her do the talking.

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      245
»
» Describe the problem. This technique avoids laying blame 
on your child for something she’s done. Blaming can make 
your toddler feel helpless and wrong all the time, and she’ll 
become defiant whenever you open your mouth. Say she’s 
spilled milk on the carpet. Rather than berate her about the 
mess she’s made, tell her there’s milk on the carpet, which 
describes the problem, and that she’d better get a cloth to 
clean it up.
»
» Give information. Junior has just drawn on the wall for the 
thousandth time. Instead of yelling at him for his misplaced 
art, show him that drawing is for paper, not walls.
»
» Offer choices. You want your little one to clear up her toys. 
Rather than order her to clean up, offer her a choice of 
which toys to clean up first.
»
» Use a single word or gesture. You’ve already asked every 
day for a year that toys be cleared up before bedtime, so 
your toddler should be getting the hang of that concept by 
now. Instead of a nightly “clean up your toys, like I’ve asked 
you a million times,” simply say “toys.” Leaving out the 
blaming and ordering should get a better result. Kids dislike 
long explanations for things. Your tyke still has a very short 
attention span.
The underlying principle of most of these techniques is to avoid 
laying blame or criticism on your child. Making her feel wrong 
will make her defiant and scared, rather than open and willing 
to take risks. Ridiculing your child for a mistake is also unlikely 
to get her to take responsibility for her mistakes in the future 
because she’ll be afraid of your ridicule.
When talking to your child, imagine the way that you like to be 
talked to by your boss, for example. You don’t like to be blamed, 
yelled at, made fun of, or ordered around. Neither does your 
toddler.

246      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Exploring Different 
Opportunities
Your role as a dad is simple — be there for your child with love, 
food, and shelter. And until now, that’s been enough. Tradition­
ally this may well have meant that you took care of your child by 
“bringing home the bacon.” But in our modern lives, there are 
other avenues you can explore as well.
The fathering road less traveled
If you’re finding, like many dads do, that keeping all your plates 
in the air — work life, home life, time for yourself — is just too 
much, there are options you can look at to reduce some of the 
stress. These options include the following:
»
» Become a stay-at-home dad (SAHD) while your partner 
works.
»
» Reduce your hours and work a four-day week or go 
part-time.
»
» Start your own business, do what you love doing, and 
organize your work life around your family (for example, by 
having a home office).
»
» Take a break from work, such as three months, especially if 
you feel you’re stuck in a dead-end career or job. Many 
career coaches recommend you change careers if your 
current job is a dead end, so use this time as a transition 
phase to spend some more time with the family.
»
» Talk to your boss about flex schedules, which means you can 
have flexible start and finish times while remaining in work 
full-time.
Money and your financial position dictate which of these options 
is available to you, so before you walk into your boss’s office with 
your resignation letter, do your math and work out what you can 
afford.

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      247
If you work from home, you can already work quite flexibly by 
scheduling your work around nap times or times when your 
­partner or family can take care of your toddler.
TV, videos, computers, and games
We live in a media age, where there are literally hundreds of TV 
channels to choose from; where people communicate via email, 
Twitter, and Facebook rather than with an old-fashioned letter; 
and where elementary school children have cellphones. Unless 
you live in a jungle or a cave, the media’s impossible to avoid.
To deal with the volume of media coming at your child, which at 
this age she’s becoming increasingly aware of, it may be a good 
idea to think in terms of moderation rather than banning your 
toddler from the TV. Watching a little bit of TV for half an hour or 
so isn’t the worst thing in the world and may help keep her out of 
your hair while you prepare a meal or have a shower, but ­letting 
her stare passively at cartoons all morning isn’t doing her a whole 
lot of good. Watching lots of TV isn’t encouraging interaction 
between the two of you or encouraging any of those ­synapses to 
keep connecting through movement or using her body, which is 
what she needs most right now.
Here are some techniques to help prevent your child turning into 
a TV addict:
»
» As your toddler grows up, he may be interested in 
­computers, handheld games, cellphones, and MP3 players. 
Establish a media-free time during the day — perhaps at 
mealtimes — when all devices are off.
»
» Have a specific time your child can watch TV rather than 
putting on a show anytime he wants. This can be an effective 
way of limiting the amount of TV he watches.
»
» Keep an eye on what programs your child watches on TV and 
make sure you’re happy with the content. That goes for the 
advertisements that are played as well. You may want to 
select a few DVDs from the library to screen rather than just 
flicking on the TV and watching whatever is playing. DVDs 
are also a great way to avoid all the advertisements that 
increasingly target young children.

248      PART 3  The Toddler Years
»
» Keep bedrooms TV-free. Computers should be in a central 
part of the house too, if space allows.
»
» Try to provide alternatives to media that force your child to 
be a passive observer. Exposing your child to a variety of 
activities like sports, handicrafts, the natural environment, 
gardening, food preparation, and music can spark an 
interest that may be lifelong.
»
» Watch TV with your child, so you can talk about what you’re 
seeing and hearing, and can encourage participation in any 
of the songs or dances on the screen.
TV is not beneficial for children under 2 years of age, says the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, whose studies show infants who 
watched TV learned fewer words than those who didn’t.
Next stop: Nursery school
As your child gets closer to becoming a preschooler (when he 
turns 3), you may want to start thinking about a more formal 
learning environment for him. Nursery school is traditionally the 
place children go to transition from being at home with a parent 
or caregiver, or a step on from child care before starting school. 
Nursery school is a place where children continue to explore 
learning through play, work on developing social skills, and begin 
academic learning, usually disguised as play.
Nursery school used to be for just those aged 3 and up, but some 
cater to children as young as 2½ years. Unlike school, ­nursery 
school isn’t compulsory, but in some areas of the country, you’ll 
find it’s pretty much the standard.
Some nursery schools are very difficult to get into and have long 
waiting lists — not just the ones in New York City, either. If you 
live in a small town, you may find that the best nursery school is 
impossible to get into unless you know the director. Don’t worry 
too much about this; any accredited nursery school can provide 
your toddler with the experiences he needs to learn and grow.
Of course, you should check out any school before you send your 
child there; word of mouth, parent recommendations, and online 

CHAPTER 11  Charging Toward Three: Months 24–36      249
reviews are good, but no substitute exists for seeing a place your­
self and assessing whether you think your child will be comfort­
able there.
If you’re thinking about sending your child off to nursery school, 
consider the following:
»
» Is she potty trained? This is essential in many nursery 
schools, and sending your child off in new superhero 
underwear and pretending he’s trained when he isn’t is not 
kosher.
»
» Do your hours match the nursery school’s? If you absolutely 
can’t get there to pick her up before 12:30 and school ends 
at 12, don’t think the teachers will be happy to watch her 
(unpaid) for another half hour. Some nursery schools do 
offer after-school day care.
»
» Is your child developmentally ready for nursery school? 
Some little ones just aren’t ready for nursery school the 
minute they turn 3. Waiting a few months can mean the 
difference between a fun experience and a nightmare for all 
of you (nursery school staff included).
»
» Is the school convenient to your house or work? The best 
school may be 20 minutes away, which may not seem like 
much until you consider winter storms, packing up a sick baby 
to take her along to pick up your toddler, or the fact that 
nursery school is often just 2½ hours long. You may just about 
get home before you have to turn around and go get him.
»
» Do you like the teachers? The physical layout? The cleanliness 
standards? The playground equipment? Does the school 
separate children by age? Do they have snacks? What kind?
If everything looks positive, it’s go time for a major event in your 
child’s life: the start of his life away from you. Shedding a few 
tears — on your part, as well as his — is to be expected.

Deciding whether to have another baby
Managing a household with more than 
one child
Getting the hang of sibling discipline
Adding to Your 
Family
O
ne of the questions fathers of one child are asked the most 
is, “So when are you having number two?” Some dads 
may be ready with an answer — “I’ve been planning on 
having seven children since I was little, so any time now.” For 
others, it may be a question of asking themselves whether ­number 
two will ever happen — one child is quite enough at the moment, 
but thanks for asking.
Adding another baby to your family changes the dynamic 
­completely and can be a tricky adjustment period as everyone — 
including your number one — finds their feet. In this chapter, 
we take you through making the financial adjustment; juggling 
the needs of two children at demanding times in their develop-
ment; and working out how to stop World War III from happen-
ing as toys, clothes, and, most importantly, your love are shared 
between the two of them.

252      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Having Another Child
Making the decision to have another child is, in some ways, as 
big a decision as having the first. In addition to all your con-
cerns about being a father again — the sleepless nights, support-
ing your partner, the trials and tribulations of daily life with a 
helpless baby or rambunctious toddler — you also must take into 
account your first child’s needs, such as his need to feel loved and 
cared for. You also now know how much time and work a baby 
takes, so the “ignorance is bliss” attitude you may have had the 
first time around is probably gone.
Here’s what you need to think about if you want to take the ratio-
nal approach to making a decision about baby #2:
»
» Are you expecting life to get easier for you because the 
children can play with one another? This may be true, but 
not until your youngest child is 2 years or older. And some 
siblings never hit it off until adulthood, due to completely 
different temperaments or interests.
»
» Can you afford for you or your partner to not earn a living 
while caring for a new baby, as well as buying any new 
equipment you may need?
»
» Do you have enough room in your house for four? Will you 
need to move? What about your transport and travel 
arrangements — will you need a larger vehicle?
»
» How mentally prepared are you to cope with a new arrival? 
Would you be excited to have another baby, or is having 
another baby something you feel you have to do to com-
plete your family?
»
» How will the practical aspects, such as sleeping arrange-
ments, routines, and child care, work?
Some parents think that only children are often spoiled, anti-
social, and lonely. While having only one child creates a situa-
tion that can bring out these tendencies in children, parents can 
easily counterbalance by involving only children in lots of social 
­settings, such as day care, playgroups, sleepovers, and team 

CHAPTER 12  Adding to Your Family      253
sports. You needn’t worry your child will turn into a spoiled brat 
just because he doesn’t have any siblings.
Is having another child worth it?
In the end, this is the question you and your partner have to 
resolve for yourselves. Having two children may not feel worth-
while when both kids are sick and up all night, and terrorizing 
each other by day. But it may be worth it when they are adults, 
have children of their own, and support each other in a way only 
family can.
Having a second child also gives you the opportunity to do things 
with your new baby differently if you feel you haven’t done things 
the way you wanted the first time around, such as sticking to a 
routine from early on or trying a different approach to settling 
baby at night.
If your partner had a traumatic birth experience or difficulties 
breastfeeding early on last time, she’ll really need your support 
this time. You have the opportunity to help your partner see your 
second child as an opportunity to have a very different experience 
this time around.
What to expect
So you’ve decided you’re ready for baby #2. With baby #2 you’ll 
almost feel like a professional — after all, you’ve been there, done 
that. Many fathers of two say they don’t feel as wound up and 
anxious about their baby the second time around, and that moth-
ers are often more relaxed and confident. That said, here are some 
things you need to know:
»
» Depending on the age gap between #1 and #2, you may 
need twice as many strollers and car seats, which may mean 
you need a bigger car.
»
» Your life will be twice as busy, with both children having 
different activities and sleep times, and possibly twice as 
many diapers to change and clothes to wash.

254      PART 3  The Toddler Years
»
» Depending on his age, your older child will not necessarily be 
particularly helpful with the younger child until he is a bit 
older, but may relish the responsibility of being in charge of 
the baby when the time comes, even if it’s just in name only.
»
» You’ll need to be a lot more organized and may find yourself 
spending more time lying in bed at night thinking about the 
laundry, getting lunch prepared for child care, and pulling 
your weight with the housework.
Budgeting and finance
Raising a child is an expensive business. Raising a child to 18 years is 
thought to cost an average of around $250,000 in the United States. 
While some things can be passed down from one child to another, 
you can assume that raising two children will nearly double your 
expenses for the next 18 years. The good news is that after having 
raised child #1, you now know what is really useful and essential, 
and what is just fluff. So our suggestion for #2 is to cut out the 
fluff and focus on essentials. You may also take heart from an old 
Spanish saying: “Every baby is born with a loaf of bread under their 
arm.” In other words, you’ll find a way to make ends meet.
You can have another baby and not have to get a third job. Here 
are some ways to do so:
»
» Stick to the essentials. You don’t need another flashy Moses 
basket or $20-a-tub diaper cream. And you didn’t need half 
of all those clothes you had first time around, did you?
»
» If you don’t still have your first child’s stuff sitting in his 
wardrobe, ask for hand-me-downs, go to swapping events 
(where you can swap clothes and toys), or check with friends 
who have kids. Check Craigslist, eBay, and other online sites 
for pricy items like cribs.
»
» Don’t buy anything until after the baby shower, or register 
for baby shower gifts at a store. That way you won’t double 
up on anything you already have.
»
» Keep an eye on specials at supermarkets and baby stores to 
start stocking up on consumables. When there’s a good sale 
on diapers, stock up — you know you’ll use them eventually.

CHAPTER 12  Adding to Your Family      255
In the coming years, child-care costs could be a major expense 
in your household. Think about how you and your partner could 
work flexibly, reduce your hours, enlist friends and family in a 
kind of group babysitting scheme, or work from home to reduce 
this cost.
Looking After Another  
Family Member
So there’s another mouth to feed, another body to clothe, and 
another bottom to wipe. If you were stretched by one baby, two 
may seem impossible right now, but it’s not.
FRUGAL DAD
So you’re having another baby and you’re strapped for cash? Try 
these cheap homemade versions of baby stuff that will save you 
money. Hey, if they were good enough for our grandparents, they’re 
good enough for us.
•	 Wipes: Cut into quarters some cheap, soft facecloths. If you’re 
really crafty, you can sew up the edges with a sewing machine to 
stop fraying. Fill a clean container with water and add a little 
almond oil. Use it to clean junior’s backside. Pat dry with a clean 
cloth afterward. Wash wipes with the diapers (if you’re using cloth 
diapers) and hang them out to dry in the sun to kill any bacteria.
•	 Breastfeeding: Talk to your partner about breastfeeding, 
which will save you a fortune in formula, bottles, and all the 
accoutrements.
•	 Coupons: Yes, it takes a little time, but saving a few bucks a week 
adds up over time, and baby items are frequent coupon items. 
Check online sites such as www.retailmenot.com to pick up 
online discounts.

256      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Taking a practical approach
All babies really need is love, warmth, food, sleep, and a clean 
bum. Though having color-coordinated outfits is mom’s thing, 
when you’ve got two kids, this may no longer be top priority.
Read Part 2 about baby’s first year to remind yourself of what’s 
coming up, such as how to avoid diaper rash, how warm your 
newborn should be kept, and which clothes you’ll need.
Get into a routine with your new baby as soon as you can, but 
don’t freak out if it all goes a little awry some days. With two 
children, you certainly won’t get everything right every day, but 
don’t beat yourself up about it.
Remember to be as hands-on with this new baby as you were with 
the last. Remember how time flew by with the first one? Well, 
here’s another chance to savor the unforgettable time when she’s 
tiny.
Keeping two or more  
healthy and safe
Having a second child is easier — and harder. It’s easier in the 
sense that you have previous experience at handling a newborn, 
but harder in the sense that you now have to wrestle your tod-
dler into his car seat with a baby demanding your attention at 
the same time. If you thought one child was enough to keep you 
occupied, two will show you that you’re capable of a lot more!
Here are some ways you can avoid your life becoming a crazy 
house:
»
» Get organized. Think about where the new baby will sleep. 
Do you need to get another crib, or is your older child ready 
to move into a bed? Organize chests of drawers and car 
seats, and work out where you’re going to change the baby. 
Most importantly, look into changing your stroller. Some 
strollers can accommodate two children, either side by side 
or by having one behind the other. If your first child is a little 
older, a stroller where he can stand on the back may be 
more to his liking.

CHAPTER 12  Adding to Your Family      257
»
» Get your family and friends involved. It takes a village to 
raise a child, so organize someone to take your older child 
on outings when you need a break, or to cook when you’re 
too exhausted.
»
» Keep healthy. The last thing you need with two little ones is 
to get ill. Inevitably your whole family will get sick, and you’ll 
be so busy looking after children all night long that you won’t 
be able to get better yourself. Keep eating well and take 
every opportunity you can to get some exercise. A fantastic 
way to find time to exercise is to combine exercise with an 
activity with child #1.
»
» Prepare yourself to give child #1 some extra love. It can 
be a rough transition for him — suddenly he has to share 
your attention with another person in the house. You need 
to compensate for that. Read more about sibling rivalry later 
in this chapter.
»
» Try not to change your older child’s routines too much. If 
you’re currently reading him five stories before bed every 
night, keep doing that. With a new person in the house, he’s 
going through enough upheaval without losing his time with 
you too.
»
» Work as a team and make a schedule. Divvy up chores 
around the house, talk about when you and your partner 
can have some time off, and don’t forget to exercise! Did we 
say that already?
Juggling activities
With two children now, both at challenging stages in their devel-
opment, you’ll need to fine-tune some of the activities you have 
in your life. It may be time to look at flexible work (see Chapter 6), 
reducing your hours, or prioritizing some of the things you do 
outside work and family.
You may find life is a bit like a game of Tetris — trying to fit 
all tasks and people you need to spend time with into a limited 
amount of space. Scheduling your tasks and making time with 
your family one of your top jobs helps ensure you don’t lose touch 
with what is really important — your partner and children.

258      PART 3  The Toddler Years
It may pay to get a calendar or keep a list on the fridge of your 
tasks, so you don’t get swamped by them.
Talk to your children all the time. Let them share in what you do 
at work and be prepared to spend time reading stories, playing, 
and doing all the dad stuff you’ve been doing so well anyway.
If you’re one of those guys who puts things off all the time, now’s 
the time to break the habit. Leaving things undone will only stress 
you out and cause you grief when you could be doing something 
you enjoy.
Sibling Discipline
All children react differently to the news that another baby is 
coming along to usurp their throne as king or queen. Some rebel 
and get extremely upset when the new baby is even mentioned. 
Others relish the chance to meet their new sibling. Some children 
change overnight from angels into demons, and others develop 
a new-found sense of responsibility and grown-upness that 
you never would have imagined. Your child may feel threatened, 
unloved, or ignored.
Understanding sibling rivalry
So far, your child has been the only apple of your eye, the center of 
your world and the center of her own world. Suddenly, a new baby 
is on the scene, taking away time and attention from her. You’re 
busy with the new baby, which means her demands come second 
and she has to wait when she doesn’t want to, share her stuff, and 
have the limelight shine somewhere else. No wonder she’s a little 
grumpy and jealous right now.
She’s caught in a place where she’s trying to find her own 
­individuality, but she still very much needs you to boost her con-
fidence and show her the way. If you’re giving too much of your 
time and attention to your new little one, she’s going to let you 
know about it by being angry and jealous, and rebelling against 
you and her new sibling.

CHAPTER 12  Adding to Your Family      259
To prepare your child for the fact that another baby is coming into 
your family, try these ideas:
»
» Break the news to your child when the three of you are 
together. A good time to do this is when mom’s belly is 
starting to stick out, or during the final trimester. Toddlers 
don’t have a good grasp of time, so you’ll be bombarded with 
cries of “Is the baby coming yet?”
»
» Keep involving your first child in lots of things you do to 
prepare for the new arrival. For example, you can take her 
along to the scans and keep explaining things to her about 
how the baby develops. She may not understand everything, 
but making her feel involved is important.
»
» Offer some choices to your child when it comes to buying for 
the new baby, such as asking her to help pick clothes and 
gear for the new baby.
»
» Let her know that the baby is not just for mom and dad; the 
baby is her brother or sister.
»
» If you’re moving your older child to a new room, do it well 
before the new baby arrives, so he won’t feel displaced. If 
he’s moving to a big bed, make a really big deal about it. Buy 
a very cool bed if you can swing it — like a race car bed or a 
fairy princess bed.
»
» Prepare her for the demands a new baby will place on the 
family: the baby will cry, will need to be fed (explain how that 
feeding will happen — your child may get upset at mom and 
baby’s new closeness if she’s breastfeeding), and will not be 
able to play with her for a little while until he grows bigger.
Coping with jealousy and fighting
No matter how well your older child copes with the news that 
another baby is on the way or how brilliantly she accepts the new 
baby’s arrival, she’s still that same volatile mix of burgeoning 
independence and emotional immaturity, so inevitably she’ll feel 
resentful and jealous from time to time.

260      PART 3  The Toddler Years
Here are some techniques you can try to minimize bad feelings:
»
» Balance the time that you spend with your newborn and 
toddler.
»
» Encourage your toddler’s pride in her new little sibling by 
showing her how to hold the baby and taking lots of photos. 
Talk to your older child about when she was a baby and get 
some pictures out to look at.
»
» Make special time to devote to your toddler that doesn’t 
include the new baby.
»
» Toddlers love to have “tasks” to do, so you can enlist her help 
in getting baby’s blanket and putting clothes away. Give her 
lots of praise for doing a good job.
»
» Try to keep your toddler’s routine as much as possible, so she 
doesn’t feel lost in all the upheaval and resent her new sibling.
»
» When your older child meets her new sibling, have the baby 
in a crib or bassinet or basket rather than in your arms.
If your older child is uninterested in the baby, don’t worry. She’ll 
take an interest in her own time.
Fighting and setting boundaries
If you’ve got your toddler feeling pretty excited about his new 
sister, fetching diapers for changes, and helping to settle her at 
night, you’re doing really well. But we’re dealing with a toddler 
who hasn’t quite worked out how to handle his emotions just yet. 
Anger, resentment, and fighting are bound to break out at some 
stage, so here are some suggestions to help manage that:
»
» Should conflict break out, act fast. Hitting, snatching, and acting 
roughly are unacceptable. Use your disciplinary action of 
choice — a stern talking-to or taking away the object of dispute 
(the toy). Distraction may also work well in these situations.
»
» Teach your older child how to touch the baby without hurting 
her, just like you do with a pet or with other children his own 
age. Use the words “gentle” and “nice,” and praise him for his 
efforts.

CHAPTER 12  Adding to Your Family      261
»
» Until you feel that your toddler can safely be around the 
baby without incident, keep a close eye on them. Toddlers 
are notorious for snatching. If baby has a toy he wants, your 
toddler may snatch it straight out of your baby’s mouth, 
which could result in some distress from baby.
»
» Your behavior is your child’s greatest teacher, and he’ll copy 
what he sees you doing. If you’re quick to anger and treat 
others with disrespect, he’ll learn to do that too.
Behavior management strategies need to relate to the develop-
mental stage and temperament of your child. Try out a few things 
(and keep trying them as your child gets older), and use what 
works best for your child. In general, distraction techniques tend 
to work better with younger children, whereas time-outs tend to 
work better with older children.
Discovering different personalities
Take a look at your own siblings, if you have them. Are you into 
the same stuff? Do you have the same temperament or ideas? 
Chances are, although you were brought up by the same parents 
and share a heck of a lot of DNA, you’ve got your own interests 
and personality. After all, we’re all individuals.
And so it is with your children. Chances are both your kids are 
quite different kettles of fish and require different things from 
you as a father. Both your children are going to require different 
ways of stimulation, encouragement, and confidence building. 
A bit of trial and error may be required.
Rather than seeing different personalities as extra work for you, 
think of them as a good thing. You get to explore different inter-
ests with your children, and they can learn from each other as they 
grow up, drawing on each other’s strengths to get them through 
challenging times. Different personalities also keeps things inter-
esting for you — never a dull day!

development

grow
Fun and Games
Y
our walking, talking child is quite a different bundle from 
the newborn you first met three years ago. He’s a dynamo 
of questions, words, stories, and kooky ideas. And he needs 
you to keep up with him. Hang out with your child (a lot) and 
hang on for the ride!
In this chapter we explore what your preschooler will be doing 
for the next couple of years as he nears school age. We share our 
ideas for keeping that inquisitive little person busy and show you 
some ways to help your child get ready for learning at school and 
beyond.
Your Active Preschooler
With his third birthday, your child graduates from being a tod-
dler to a preschooler. Preschooler isn’t a great term because it 
describes what your child isn’t, rather than what he is, but that’s 
the most well-worn term to describe ages 3 and 4 years old. Note: 
Some people use “young children,” but that applies to a wide age 
range, so we decided to stick with preschooler.

266      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Mapping the next two years
As well as getting more of a grip on his language skills, being able 
to come up with more complex sentence structures, and increas-
ing his vocabulary, your child is developing in the following ways. 
Your preschooler
»
» Has more control over his emotions, is able to empathize 
more, and shows concern for others
»
» Is able to express more complex emotions like embarrass-
ment, pride, and guilt
»
» Likes to take part in imaginative games, like playing doctor or 
school, or pretending boxes are boats and rockets
»
» Can sort shapes, like pegs and shells or buttons
»
» Can use alternate feet to climb stairs or steps and, as he gets 
closer to 5, to skip
»
» Starts understanding abstract concepts like “being a hero,” 
confidence, or what it means to be the “good guy/bad guy” in 
a play
»
» Can perform simple tasks and use scissors
»
» Can serve himself food, and eat and drink by himself
»
» Becomes more invested in friendships as he nears school age
Your child is also learning to really count; recognizes the letters 
of the alphabet rather than just reciting them by rote; knows the 
names of lots of animals, plants, objects, and people; and much 
more, provided you keep stimulating him with books, pictures, 
outings, and opportunities.
Building self-sufficiency  
and self-esteem
Like an athlete training for a big race, or a gymnast for a com-
petition, practice makes perfect. The more you do something, the 
better you get at it. For a child to master a skill, she must do it 
again and again with lots of mistakes along the way so that she 
can improve and feel a sense of accomplishment.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      267
As a father, your role is to provide plenty of opportunities for your 
child to practice, make mistakes, improve, and master a skill in 
order to build self-esteem and feel pride in her achievements. Let-
ting your child fall, fail, and pick herself up again can be ­difficult 
at times, especially because you can often see in advance what’s 
going to happen and may not want to deal with the consequences 
of her fall. But giving her the space to mess up is important, and 
your attitude that you believe she can get better with practice rubs 
off too.
Between the ages of 3 and 4, let your child take on more tasks 
that she may not get right at first but will accomplish, with a 
little time, practice, and patience from you. A great example is 
giving your child little jobs around the house, or getting her to do 
personal hygiene jobs herself, like washing her hands or brushing 
her teeth. (You may have to follow up with a little extra help to 
make sure these tasks are done effectively.)
Giving healthy doses of praise when your child tries really hard or 
achieves a goal boosts her confidence and makes her feel pretty 
pleased with herself.
Praise
Using praise is tricky. Tired fathers coming home from work at 
night or after a long day minding the children can easily give a 
glib “that’s great, darling” without really looking at the picture 
their preschooler has drawn. She’ll know your heart isn’t really in 
it and feel doubtful about her achievements.
Praise should also be nonjudgmental; that is, rather than say-
ing about a painting, “Wow, that’s fantastic, darling,” be specific 
about what it is you like or which skills you see developing. “I like 
the way you used purple” or “You are really good at coloring her 
hair” gives your child a sense of her accomplishment, and she will 
use that praise to tell herself “I’m good at using color” when she 
approaches a drawing next time. Also, point out specifics in the 
painting, such as “I can see you’ve painted a house.”
Making out what your child has actually drawn can be hard, but 
guessing correctly isn’t important. Your budding artist will tell 
you that the “house” is actually a “dog,” and you can then discuss 
with her aspects of how she has drawn her dog.

268      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Active movement
Active movement — that is, getting out there with your child and 
encouraging physical activities — is an important tool for build-
ing self-esteem and confidence.
Children (and adults) learn through repetition. When we do 
something over and over, it seems to become locked in our brains. 
Learning things like climbing a ladder takes time and practice for 
little children to master, and there will probably be some falls and 
spills along the way. But without that practice, how will she ever 
get the chance to learn to climb a ladder? Some child-care profes-
sionals also believe that physical movement is key to helping the 
brain develop fully.
Genuine praise for your child’s accomplishments as she gains 
more confidence in her body also encourages her to get physi-
cal more often, which can only be good for her and help keep her 
healthy and confident of her abilities.
Embrace your inner child and get active with your children. Play 
on swings, go down the slide, and play on the monkey bars (if you 
can actually do this). As a dad, you’re not only a role model for 
your children, showing them how to master a skill, but if you also 
become part of the activity and want to give it a try too, they’ll 
love the activity all the more.
Even if you don’t have a playground close to your home where 
you can let your child practice swinging, jumping, climbing, and 
balancing, you can encourage active movement at your own place. 
Here are some ideas:
»
» Create an obstacle course in your living room from chairs 
with sheets draped over them, and boxes and tables to crawl 
through and under.
»
» Dance in your living room — often the emptiest room in the 
house. Take note of music your child enjoys; it will come in 
handy when she’s fussy or bored.
»
» Go on a walk in your area (not too far — you don’t want a 
cranky, tired child you have to carry home) and check out 
mailboxes, flowers in gardens, birds on telephone wires, and 
cracks in the pavement.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      269
»
» Play chase. You probably know by now that little kids love to 
be chased and will take off, wanting you to follow. Put a scarf 
in your child’s pants so it sticks out like a tail and chase her 
while trying to get the scarf.
»
» Play hide and seek. If your child can’t count, use an egg  
timer to measure the time passed before she comes looking 
for you.
»
» Roll down a gentle slope, or play helicopters where you spin 
around and around until you’re dizzy. This helps your child’s 
developing sense of balance and is really great fun!
»
» Show your child how to jump off low walls, and on and off 
surfaces you put on the floor for her, like a towel or piece of 
carpet. Be prepared for a few tumbles at first! (Try to make 
sure they aren’t yours.)
»
» Walk like a bear around the house on all fours, play wheel-
barrow walk, and make a rope swing on a tree in your yard 
to encourage upper body development. Don’t hurt yourself.
Classes
You can also consider enrolling your child in classes like junior 
soccer, swimming and water confidence, singing, or music and 
movement. Follow your child’s lead by paying attention to the 
things she enjoys doing.
Keeping a check on  
fatherly ­concerns
Dads have been known to be somewhat competitive and to com-
pare and measure children against one another. Raising children, 
however, is not a competitive sport, and there’s no medal for hav-
ing a child who is first to spell “encyclopedia” or count to 1,000. 
Every child moves and develops at his own pace.
Patience with your child’s pace is one of the most important 
things you can give him right now. He’s got to have space and 
time to develop and learn, and expecting him to do what others 
can do will leave you frustrated, and him less likely to figure it 

270      PART 4  The Preschool Years
out for himself. It certainly doesn’t boost his confidence to say, 
“Johnny can already count to 100 — why can’t you do that?”
Take a deep breath when he spills milk on the carpet for the hun-
dredth time as he learns to master drinking from a glass, or drops 
his knife and fork as he tries to put his plate on the kitchen coun-
ter. He’ll get there. By helping, encouraging, and gently challeng-
ing him, rather than getting frustrated and doing it for him, he’ll 
learn he can do it by himself and have more confidence in his 
abilities.
So you want junior to be a world-class golfer and already have 
him swinging clubs in the backyard. But he’s just not getting golf 
and wants to water the garden or help with the cooking instead. 
Follow his lead and ditch the clubs. Remember that old saying, 
“You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink”? It’s 
the same with children. You can buy your child golf clubs, but you 
can’t make him like playing golf. You may have to get used to the 
idea that you’ve got a potential Top Chef on your hands, not a golf 
champion.
During the preschool years, many children often switch from 
being very close to mom if she’s been the primary caregiver to 
wanting to be with dad all the time. This is great news for dads! 
It means you have more opportunities to hang out with your kid 
and deepen that already awesome relationship you have with him. 
Make more of your time available to your little champ and enjoy 
the attention you’re getting!
Keeping Your Preschooler Busy
Some preschoolers are always on the move; they’re always asking 
questions and exploring the world. That’s a great thing, but it can 
be a little tiring, and on a rainy day, a high-energy preschooler 
may be a tantrum waiting to happen. In the following sections, we 
show you some ways to make the most of the time you and your 
preschooler have together that are fun and a little educational.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      271
“Dad, I’m bored”
For years to come, you’ll occasionally hear the refrain all fathers 
fear — “Dad, I’m bored.” Not only is she bored, but she wants you 
to fix the problem. Brushing off your child with a computer game 
or putting on a movie is easy, but the best activities for your pre-
schooler are the ones that involve the two of you being together. 
These are opportunities to read, play, explore, and learn together 
or to introduce junior to a hobby or passion of yours that she may 
be interested in.
Here are some ideas for banishing the “I’m bored” blues:
»
» Ask a question about a concept your child wouldn’t have 
come across, like “Do you know how bats can fly in the dark 
without bumping into things?” Then offer to find out with 
her. Do some research together and make it into a “solving 
the mystery” quest.
»
» Build something together, such as a swing, a bird feeder, 
or a wooden seat, but be clear about safety around tools. 
Three-year-olds and saws — along with many other tools —  
are not a good mix. For that matter, some dads and tools 
aren’t such a good mix either; know your limits! And keep a 
close eye on both your tools and your child when you’re in 
building mode.
»
» Encourage a love of gardening and growing her own food by 
starting a little garden in the backyard. Pumpkins and peas 
are pretty easy to grow, and your child will be encouraged to 
eat them at dinnertime knowing she’s grown the food herself!
»
» Hide something in the house or garden that she has to find 
by asking you for clues.
»
» Involve your child in a chore you have to do, like vacuuming 
or washing the car. Let her be in charge of washing the tires 
or lifting rugs for you to clean under. Helping with tasks like 
hanging out the washing develops fine motor skills and 
makes a dull job more enjoyable.

272      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Rather than just flicking on the TV, make a point of selecting 
what your child is going to watch and involve her in the 
decision making. For example, go to the library to select a 
DVD, and then watch it together.
»
» Read some books. If you’re sick of reading the same books 
over and over, head to the library for some new ones.
»
» Remember all the games you used to play as a child like 
“I spy with my little eye”? Play them with your child.
»
» Take a trip to the beach to play in the sand; go for a bike ride; 
visit the local playground; take a child-friendly trail walk; or 
wander around the botanic gardens, museum, or zoo. Keep 
talking with your child all the time about what you see and 
hear, and ask her questions about what she thinks about 
things you come across.
»
» Visit a local farm. Many farmers are more than happy to 
open the gates and show you around (provided you arrange 
a suitable time with them beforehand).
»
» Visit some pals. Arrange a play date with other kids your 
child’s age from nursery school, your prenatal group, or 
other friends with children.
Sometimes saying she’s bored is your child’s code for “I want to 
watch TV or play on the computer.” It can be easy just to let her, 
especially if you have chores you need to do or you’re tired. But 
try to resist. Perhaps just a quick trip to the local park will give her 
enough lift to come home and be entertained with doing her own 
thing for the rest of the afternoon.
Encourage your child to come up with activities she would like to 
try to keep on hand when the “I’m bored” blues hit.
Surviving snow (and rain) days
Adults find it difficult not to go stir-crazy with cabin fever when 
it’s raining and cold outside. For children, who have energy to 
burn, not going mad is even harder.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      273
So what can you do about it? Here are some ideas:
»
» Board games are always good fun for an emergency. 
Perhaps invite some friends over to play.
HOW TO MAKE YOUR  
OWN PLAY DOUGH
Here’s everything you need to make play dough:
2 cups plain flour
2 cups warm water
1 cup salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon cream of tartar
Food coloring
1.	 Mix all the ingredients together in a pot over low heat. Stir.
2.	 When the mixture thickens, clumps in the middle, and feels dry 
rather than sticky, remove from the heat and allow to cool.
3.	 Turn out onto a counter or tray and knead until the dough’s silky 
smooth.
4.	 Divide into as many balls as you want to make colors.
5.	 Poke a finger into each ball and add a drop of your desired color 
into the hole. This protects your hands from coming into contact 
with the concentrated food coloring, which can stain your skin. 
Knead the color through the ball.
This dough keeps for a few days and is best kept in the fridge. Wrap 
the dough in cling film to stop it from drying out. If the dough does 
dry out, it can be dampened with a little water.
Voilà! Now you can get really creative. Watch out, Michelangelo!

274      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Find out about open days at your local fire station, your local 
police station, the city council, or a large factory nearby, such 
as a processing plant. (If you live near a chocolate factory or 
other kid-friendly and kid-interesting plant, this is a good 
place to start!) You can also ask about public tours of places 
that your child shows interest in.
»
» Get hands-on by getting out the craft supplies or playing with

creativity and fine motor skills. See the nearby sidebar “How 
to make your own play dough” for a recipe.

» Get out some old photos from when you were a child, teen, 
or student. Organize a family photo session, which can be 
even better if you have some old slides and a projector. 
Create a fabulous home cinema experience for your child.

» Organize a trip to a nearby airport, train station, harbor, or 
dock. Young children are typically fascinated by the hustle 
and bustle that can be observed at these places.
»
» Pretend you’re outdoors by making a tent out of chairs or a 
table and some sheets. You could camp out all day in your 
tent, with snacks, toys, books, and pillows for lounging on.

» Visit the local museum or indoor play center. Bring lots of 
cash for the gift shop at the museum or for all the “extras” at 
the play center.
Bringing out your child’s talents 
without going OTT
Expecting your child to be super-skilled at something at this age 
is unreasonable, although you may think the way she kicks a ball 
means she’s the next female David Beckham. Rather, this is a 
time for giving your child lots of opportunities for her to discover 
what she’s good at and what she enjoys doing. How will your 

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      275
child discover if she loves gardening if she never sees a garden, or 
enjoys fishing if you never show her what fishing is all about? We 
don’t mean spending thousands on fishing gear, but by exposing 
your child to ideas, telling her what others are doing, and showing 
her in books, you’ll see what your child takes a fancy to.
Sometimes you can use this opportunity to try out something new 
yourself and share that experience with your little one. Remem-
ber the saying, “Do something that scares you every day.” Doing 
something new with your children is a great way to step outside 
your own comfort zone.
Being a dad is also about showing your children that you, too, 
have to learn new things and that you’re ready to try something 
new. Take a keen interest in what your children like doing, even if 
they’re not interested in your favorite sport or activity.
Follow your child’s interests. Let her choose which books she’s 
interested in, what games she likes, and which activities she’s 
into. Forcing your values on her or making her decisions for 
her isn’t going to help build her relationship with you or let her 
become her own person.
Being a good sport
Preschoolers are more interested in other people than toddlers 
are, but they still struggle to control their emotions and impulses. 
While your child may love playing with others, it can be hard for 
her to accept not having her own way all the time, and playing 
sports or games where there are winners and losers can be really 
tricky for a preschooler to deal with. Learning to lose without los-
ing your cool is a skill, like learning to ride a bike. Being able to 
cope with losing is a step toward being able to admit making mis-
takes or accepting not getting your way, which are emotions that 
even adults struggle with. Being a good winner and not gloating 
is also an important skill to learn.
Here are some ideas you can instill in your child to help her 
become a good sport:
»
» Be a good sport as a father. You’re a role model, and 
accepting defeat gracefully encourages the same behavior in 
your child.

276      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Congratulate the winner. It takes grace to admit someone 
else played better on the day. If you’re the winner, be gracious 
about winning by not rubbing it in the other team’s face.
»
» Focus on the fact that the performance, not the person, 
lost. Your child is not a “loser” because she lost. She’s the 
same person and may beat her opponent next time. She lost 
because of the way she played, not because of who she is.
»
» Don’t make excuses for why your child lost. Blaming 
others like referees or cheating from the other side only 
makes you look desperate, and it means your child has no 
chance to analyze why she lost and improve her perfor-
mance for next time.
Social skills and an understanding of teamwork take a long time 
to develop. Younger children can generally focus on only one 
thing at a time (that’s why 3-year-olds playing football all chase 
the ball and don’t keep their positions). So be realistic about your 
expectations when it comes to team sports.
Experiencing nature
Preschoolers are naturally curious, active, and imaginative. And 
what better place to hook into all those parts of themselves than 
out in nature?
For a fun day out that will charge his batteries and get those brain 
connections whirring, try taking your child to
»
» The beach: There’s a reason why parks and nursery schools 
have sandpits — sand is a blank canvas for a child to play on. 
Your child can create castles, words, faces, and shapes. Or he 
can just feel the sand and scoop it up for hours. Most little 
kids also love the water, so keep a look out to make sure he’s 
safe — and remember the sunblock.
»
» The great outdoors: Try taking a walk through a park, in 
the woods, or on local trails for a few hours to get your 
child’s body and mind fit and healthy. Take along a book 
about native plants or birds and animals, and see what you 
can find.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      277
Another great thing about using the outdoors and nature is that 
they’re usually free of charge.
Encouraging an appreciation of the great outdoors also encour-
ages an appreciation of the environment. Remember to take only 
pictures and leave only footprints when you’re out and about.
Lifelong Learning Starts Here
The first years of a child’s life are critical to his development as 
a thinking, feeling human being. Forming an attachment to you 
and your partner, and forming connections between different 
parts of his brain, is your child’s main function at this age.
School is on your child’s horizon, and with it comes a more formal 
way of learning than you’ve been practicing at home with books, 
toys, and talk.
Fathers as first teachers
As a father, you are your child’s role model and teacher. He’ll 
learn more from you than how to tie his shoelaces or use a knife 
and fork. Giving your child the opportunity to spend time with 
you — doing puzzles, climbing trees, and reading together — 
makes you his first teacher.
The teaching and example you set now shape how your child 
respects other people, manages his emotions, takes winning and 
losing with dignity, treats the environment, and manages rela-
tionships with those around him.
Your values, attitudes, and beliefs filter down to him, and if 
you’ve had a rough upbringing or your experience with schools 
and authority was not a happy one, you may want to think about 
ways you can change that for your child, so he has a fresh start.

278      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Starting school on the right foot
If your child hasn’t gone to day care, the first time he leaves home for 
periods of time away from you may be to go to nursery school, also 
known as preschool. In Chapter  11, we discuss how nursery schools 
prepare your child for school and teach children skills through play.
If your child is already in day care, talk with the teachers there 
about whether they have sessions that prepare children for 
school as they turn 3 and 4. Some day care centers offer pre-
school ­programs starting at 2½ or 3 years. If you don’t have a 
day-care option and have to pick a place from many available, see 
­Chapter 11 for more guidance on picking the right school.
If your child is used to a specific routine, you need to work pre-
school into it. Some kids adapt better to this change than others. 
Most centers have morning and afternoon sessions, so consider 
which will work better with your schedule as well as your child’s. 
If your child is a late riser, getting him up, fed, dressed, and into 
the car before 9 a.m. may seem like more trouble than it’s worth. 
But if he still takes a solid two-hour nap, he may be falling asleep 
in his snack if he attends an afternoon session.
If your child hasn’t been to day care, the stimulation at preschool 
may tire him, so be flexible about bedtimes and naps, perhaps 
putting him to bed a little earlier at night.
Leaving your child at preschool can be tough at first as she settles 
in, but don’t feel guilty. Feel confident that the staff have seen it 
all before and know how to handle it. If your child is upset about 
you leaving, give her to a teacher, give her a kiss, and tell her that 
you love her and you’ll see her later. Give her a wave and let the 
staff get on with their job. If you come back two minutes later, 
you may find your child happily absorbed in an activity, having 
completely forgotten you were ever there.
Learning objectives
Finding out what your child is capable of learning at this age is 
a bit tricky, as all children develop at their own speed. But you 
can encourage her learning by stimulating her with books and 
images, and with one-on-one time with you.

CHAPTER 13  Fun and Games      279
Here are some objectives you can aim for:
»
» Learning the alphabet: Use jigsaw puzzles and point out 
letters when you’re reading — for example, “That’s A for 
apple.” Use a chalkboard or drawing paper to practice the 
shapes of letters.
»
» Learning to count: Lots of books with numbers are 
available, and when you’re at the store or out and about, you 
can count together the number of things you see. Take it 
slowly at first. Getting to ten is a major achievement!
»
» Learning about time and the seasons: Use pictures on 
your child’s bedroom wall, books, and your own backyard to 
show how time passes and seasons change.
As your child approaches school age, talk to your local school 
about things they may expect a new entrant to know and what 
skills will make going off to school easier. You may also want 
to talk to your day-care or preschool teacher about your child’s 
progress and which areas he may need help with.
Learning for the whole family
Even though you’re the father and you’re the one role-modeling 
and passing on your knowledge to your kids, learning is a two-
way street. You can learn a lot from your child too. Your child can 
teach you the following:
»
» How to be totally in the moment: Watch your son’s delight 
at running sand through his fingers.
»
» How to see the world for the first time again: Enjoy the 
moment with your son when he sees an animal at the zoo 
he’s never seen before.
»
» How to translate the world, later in life: Just like you did 
for your parents, your child will be able to explain why what’s 
in fashion looks good and why music on the radio is popular.
»
» How to make the best out of every situation: For example, 
you’ll learn how unimportant your son rubbing his snotty nose 
on your suit pants just before work is.

280      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Patience: When your normally brave little soldier thinks 
there’s a dragon under his bed at 3 a.m., you can muster the 
patience to convince him he’s going to be okay.
»
» What really matters in life: Is it impressing the boss with 
long hours, or being home in time to read Green Eggs and 
Ham with your son?
Another fun activity is to switch roles with your children: Ask 
them to play “dad” while you play “child.” The outcome can be 
hilarious — or maybe disconcerting — as they play back your own 
behavior to you. It can give you interesting clues about what you 
might want to change in how you treat your child. You can, of 
course, also get your own back by throwing yourself on the floor, 
screaming, and shouting to explain what your son looks like when 
he’s in tantrum mode.

our health is the most important thing you have. Surely the 
health of your child is equally important or even more 
important to you. She doesn’t yet know how to maintain 
her health, so you need to ensure that she stays in tiptop shape. 
The health she enjoys now, and the healthy eating and exercise 
she does, are good habits to instill in the early years and will stay 
with her for life.
In this chapter we show you how to encourage and maintain 
those good habits, not just for her but for you too. We guide you 
through the difficulties of picky eaters, allergies, and introducing 
new foods. We also bring you up to speed on the multiple bugs and 
illnesses your child will inevitably pick up from her environment, 
which is a rather challenging part of fatherhood.

282      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Food, Nutritious Food
Like you, young children need three meals a day plus snacks and 
plenty to drink every day to keep healthy and active.
Your child needs a variety of foods from each of these groups:
»
» Breads and cereals: At least four servings a day, of which 
half or more should be whole grains.
»
» Dairy products and milk: Two to three servings a day. 
Children under age 2 should drink whole milk.
»
» Fats and oils: Children need fat for brain development. At 
ages 2–3, 30 to 35 percent of a child’s calories should come 
from fats, preferably unsaturated fats.
»
» Meats, legumes, and other sources of protein like eggs 
or soy: One to two servings a day.
»
» Vegetables and fruit: At least five servings a day (two fruit, 
three vegetable).
A serving is usually the size of your child’s palm, or a piece of 
bread, glass of milk, or one-serving-size container of yogurt.
Cooking and baking for busy dads
Getting all these “servings” into your child may seem daunting, 
but it’s not. Don’t panic if junior hasn’t had exactly what’s in 
the guidelines; his appetite will guide you for the most part. It’s 
important to not force-feed your child because he may develop an 
aversion to the food you’re trying to get into him. He may also get 
very upset and throw up, which means you’ll have achieved the 
opposite of what you were trying to do.
If you’re stuck for ideas, try these:
»
» Breads, cereals and other starches: Avoid cereals colored 
to appeal to children; they’re often filled with sugar. Instead, 
offer whole-grain cereals, breads, oatmeal, muffins, rice, 
risotto, pasta, couscous, or quinoa.

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      283
»
» Fruit and vegetables: Try dried fruit (only occasionally, as 
the sugars in them can harm teeth); frozen or canned fruit 
and vegetables, which are just as nutritious as fresh, as long 
as they’re not packaged in syrup; and fruit and vegetables in 
muffins or sandwiches.
»
» Meat, legumes, and protein: Offer sliced lunchmeats, 
baked beans, kidney or pinto beans, peanut butter or other 
nut spreads, tuna in a sandwich or salad, tofu, or chickpeas.
»
» Milk and dairy products: Serve cheese slices in a sandwich, 
yogurt, or a fruit smoothie or milkshake.
A simple strategy to inspire kids to eat a variety of fruit and veg-
etables is to point out the colors to them — for example, “You’ve 
eaten lots of orange food; how about some green (peas), red 
(tomatoes), and yellow (sweet corn) food?”
Kids need fluid just like adults do, so keep your tyke topped up 
with cartons of milk or soy milk, or water in a bottle.
Drinking juice is not recommended because the sugar content is 
very high. If you do want to give your child juice, dilute it, and 
avoid giving it after he has brushed his teeth at night.
You’ll find more recipes, dietary guidelines, and nutrition infor-
mation at www.nutrition.gov/life-stages/children.
Avoiding the wrong foods
The U.S. Department of Agriculture decided to replace the Food 
Pyramid for healthy eating with MyPlate a few years ago. Foods 
high in salt, sugar, and saturated or trans fat should still be lim-
ited, which means you should have them only as occasional treats. 
Just as certain foods are “sometimes” foods for dads, so they are 
“sometimes” foods for your children and should be eaten a few 
times a week at the most.
Occasional treat foods include foods that are
»
» Heavy in sugars, like hard candy, cookies, chocolate, and 
dried fruit.

284      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Heavily processed, such as microwavable or frozen meals 
such as pizza or pies, fruit roll-ups, and sweet cereals.
»
» Laden with saturated fats, like fish and chips, or burgers.
»
» High in salt and flavorings, such as crackers and chips. Even 
commercial soups can have a very high sodium count.
We’ve also become increasingly aware of how food additives, 
­flavorings, and colorings can affect our children; how process-
ing can take away nutritional value; and how cruel some farming 
practices can be to animals. There’s a movement toward eating 
more organic, less processed foods in order to avoid pesticide res-
idues and get more nutritional value from what we eat. You may 
want to consider doing the same.
If your child is under 3, avoid foods that may choke him, such as 
nuts, olives, or popcorn. Even after 3, discourage eating while on 
the move, watching TV, or doing anything that may ­distract him. 
Keep cutting food into small pieces to avoid an ­airway blockage.
Telling your child “no” for the hundredth time to the candy or 
cookies you have stashed in the pantry is easier said than done, 
and even if you don’t have a private supply that junior knows 
about, he’s going to discover treat foods at school or at friends’ 
houses. So you probably won’t be able to keep your child as pure 
as the day he was born. That’s okay. A few animal crackers every 
now and then isn’t going to turn him into Fat Albert. Just keep 
remembering to fill him full of good stuff whenever you can and 
encourage him to get active.
Completely banning “bad” foods makes them objects of desire, so 
let your child have a few treats now and then, just like you would 
treat yourself. Children need fat in their diet, but things like chips 
should be limited to once a week.
Introducing different foods
Putting a plate of never-seen-before food in front of your child 
can be a little disconcerting for her. She may turn her nose up 
at something you think she’ll love just because it looks funny. 

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      285
So take some time to introduce new tastes and textures thought-
fully. Here are some ideas:
»
» Do it yourself. You are your child’s role model, and if you dig 
into your food with gusto, chances are she will too.
»
» Get creative with your presentation. Make a face, shapes, 
or patterns with food.
»
» Give her something to dip into. Low-fat dressing, tomato 
sauce, mild salsa, hummus, and yogurt dips all provide a fun 
way of testing out new foods.
»
» Get sneaky. Put finely chopped pieces of new foods into 
stews, omelets, mashed potatoes, smoothies, or rice.
»
» Grow your own. One way to get children into fruits and 
vegetables is to let them take part in growing it themselves. 
She’ll be enormously proud to dig into those beans she’s 
seen grow from seed and watered every night.
»
» Keep portions small. Not only will this keep new foods from 
seeming so overwhelming, but it will also get you in the habit 
of not overloading your child’s plate. And never, ever enroll 
your child in the “clean plate club”; forcing kids to eat more 
than they want or need can start bad habits that lead to 
obesity down the road.
Forcing children to eat something they don’t like is counterpro-
ductive. If your child tries a new meal and doesn’t like it, that’s 
okay. She’ll make up for it by eating others. Punishing your child 
for not eating makes her more defiant. Remember also that chil-
dren take time to develop a taste for something. The fact that 
she turned down broccoli the first time she tried it doesn’t mean 
she’ll never like it.
Leading by example
You are your child’s role model, and what you eat and how you 
live sets the scene for how your child will eat and live.
Children who have one obese parent have a 40 percent chance of 
becoming obese themselves, and children with two obese parents 
have an 80 percent chance of facing obesity. That’s a poor legacy 

286      PART 4  The Preschool Years
to leave a child. If you’ve already fallen into the trap of giving your 
child whatever sugary and fatty processed foods she wants, now is 
an opportunity to consider a change of course and swap unhealthy 
food options with healthy ones. Here are some simple ways to 
make meals healthier:
»
» Avoid processed and pre-prepared foods. Generally, the 
less time food has spent going through a factory, the better 
it is for you. This also goes for basic ingredients like sugar, 
flour, or rice. Use raw or brown sugar, whole grain flour, and 
brown rice.
»
» Eat meals as a family when you can. Turn off the TV and 
use dinnertime to catch up on your day and enjoy each other’s 
company. Sharing food is an important social interaction for 
humans, and enjoying food together should be special.
»
» Exercise restraint. If you habitually have dessert, keep the 
portions small.
»
» Find out about healthy substitutes to sugar and fat-
laden foods. Try natural yogurt with fruit added rather than 
tubs of sweetened yogurt, for example. Honey is an excellent 
replacement for refined, white sugar, after your child is over 
age 1. Honey is a natural product and complex food that is 
easier to digest and produces less of a “sugar high” than 
white sugar.
»
» Prepare meals together. Let your child have some respon-
sibility over what goes into her food. Get her involved in 
where your food comes from and how easy it is to prepare. 
As we get older, making food for each other is another social 
interaction that shows our family and friends how much we 
love and care for each other, and this can be a positive 
activity for your child to enjoy right now.
Handling fussy eaters
Children may go through a fussy eating period. This stage is 
annoying and frustrating, and all you want your child to do is eat! 
It’s enough to make a grown man cry. There can sometimes be a 
reason behind it, such as meal times falling at a time when she’s 
tired, too much distraction when she should be eating, or snacking 

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      287
before mealtimes. In all circumstances patience with fussy eating 
results in better eating than getting angry and annoyed.
Here are some ways to deal with fussy eaters:
»
» Avoid arguing about food. Forcing your child to eat mush-
rooms is unlikely to encourage a love of them in the future, 
so you’re no further ahead next time you serve them up.
»
» Avoid giving snacks in the hour before a meal, as she won’t 
be hungry when mealtime arrives.
»
» Offer a variety of small servings of food in a meal, with lots of 
vegetables and other goodies to choose from, so if she 
doesn’t like one food she has others to choose from.
»
» Praise your child when she eats, especially when she tries 
something new and different.
»
» Try some of the suggestions from the section “Leading by 
example” earlier in this chapter, such as getting your child 
involved in food preparation, making meal times a family time, 
and growing your own food. Take small amounts and don’t 
feel like you need to polish off your plate whenever you eat.
Try to avoid the following:
»
» Cooking another meal to feed her if she turns up her nose at 
the first
»
» Giving your child a treat to make her stop whining
»
» Having meals in front of TV or while doing something else, 
such as reading, playing games, or walking around the house
If you’re concerned that your fussy eater isn’t getting enough to 
eat to grow, play, and be active, talk to your pediatrician.
Coping with special dietary 
­requirements
More and more children seem to be developing allergies to certain 
foods, such as wheat, gluten, eggs, nuts, milk, shellfish, and even 

288      PART 4  The Preschool Years
some types of fruits and vegetables. Some children may grow out 
of them; others won’t. Managing an allergy can be a matter of life 
or death.
The recommended practice of introducing new foods one at a 
time helps with detecting reactions to certain foods. If your child 
shows symptoms of an allergic reaction, take him to your health-
care provider to have him tested.
What is an allergy?
An allergy is a reaction by the immune system when it thinks the 
food you’re eating is harmful. It produces histamines, which can 
cause hives or other rashes, breathing difficulties, a tight throat, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The most dangerous reaction the 
body can have is called anaphylaxis, in which the tongue swells, 
air passages narrow, and blood pressure drops. Anaphylaxis can 
cause death.
Recognizing the most common 
food allergens
Just six common foods cause 90 percent of allergic reactions in 
children: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat. Between 
2 and 3 percent of children under age 3 have a cow’s milk allergy, 
although some outgrow it over time.
Children with cow’s milk allergy may also experience allergic 
reactions to soy.
How do you manage an allergy?
Avoiding the foods that cause the body to overreact is the best way 
to avoid an allergic reaction. The jury is still out on what causes 
allergies — the tendency toward allergies, but not specific aller-
gies, is most likely inherited — but some physicians feel that the 
later potentially harmful foods are introduced, the less likely your 
child is to develop a reaction to them.
Luckily, more people are learning about food allergies and food 
producers are hopping on the bandwagon too. You can now find 
many substitutes for common food allergens, those foods that 
cause an allergy. Wheat-free breads, pastas, and baking products 
are available; you can buy egg substitute for baking; and cow’s 

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      289
milk can be easily replaced by soy or rice milk. Many day care cen-
ters, kindergartens, and schools have banned nuts and nut prod-
ucts from the premises in a move to ensure the safety of children 
with nut allergies.
It can be hard to work out whether your child is in fact allergic to 
certain foods. Talk to your pediatrician — you may be able to have 
your child tested for the most common allergies, if he has com-
mon symptoms.
If your child is allergic to certain foods, you’ll have to be more 
vigilant about reading labels on food packaging, and to make 
other parents and caregivers aware of your child’s allergy so that 
at day care, on play dates, or at birthday parties, your child isn’t 
given food that may cause a reaction.
Some people think that just having a small amount of an aller-
gen is okay, but this has been shown to be very dangerous. Small 
amounts or even being in the same room as an allergen is enough 
to make some children seriously ill. For severe cases of aller-
gies, children may have to carry an EpiPen, which administers 
medicine in the event of an allergic reaction. Talk to your doctor 
about allergies and discuss ways of managing your child’s allergy, 
including EpiPens. It may also be helpful to speak with a dietitian 
who can help manage the allergy and teach you and your child 
what you need to do to avoid allergic reactions.
Smooth peanut butter can be given to children from eight to nine 
months of age, but watch them closely for any signs of a ­reaction. 
If your family has a strong history of nut allergies, wait until 
your child is 3 before trying nuts. If your child has any breathing 
­difficulties, call 911 immediately.
Being informed about what you’re dealing with when your 
child has a food allergy helps you stay on top of it. See this 
site for tips on managing your child’s allergy and contacting 
­support networks: acaai.org/allergies/who-has-allergies/
children-allergies.
Vegetarian children
A vegetarian diet is becoming a lifestyle choice for more and more 
parents, be it to save the planet or on moral grounds. If you want 

290      PART 4  The Preschool Years
to bring up your child on a vegetarian diet, you have to pay a 
bit more attention to where he gets his iron and protein, espe-
cially because children have higher iron needs than adults. Good 
sources of iron include the following:
»
» Most dark green (leafy) vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, 
Swiss chard, and kale
»
» Dried fruit such as prunes and raisins
»
» Lentils, chickpeas, and dried peas
»
» Whole-grain cereal and bread
»
» Egg yolks (if you follow an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet)
Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron, so make having fruit such 
as citrus or kiwifruit with a meal part of your routine.
You can help your child get plenty of protein by feeding him
»
» Dairy products
»
» Eggs
»
» Grains like brown rice, oatmeal, buckwheat, and millet
»
» Hummus, chickpeas, and most legumes, such as soy beans 
and lentils
»
» Peanut butter and nuts (for children age 3 and older)
»
» Tofu and tempeh
»
» Vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, beets, and cabbage
A great way of getting protein into your child is adding puffed-up 
grains to muesli or cereal. Puffed-up grains include millet, rye, or 
quinoa (they’re all healthy alternatives to wheat).
A vegetarian diet can be bulkier and more filling than a nonveg-
etarian diet, so your child may feel fuller with less food. Offer 
smaller meals more frequently throughout the day to ensure he 
gets enough energy and nutrients to get through his day.

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      291
Excellent Exercise
We’ve talked a lot about how being active from birth helps to 
develop your child’s brain. And, this may not be earth-shattering 
news — exercise is quite good for her body too!
Getting your child (and yourself) 
into exercise
An amazing fact of human biology is that, just by being active 
with our bodies, we grow our brains. So keeping active and exer-
cising can help your child develop her mental powers!
But the balancing act of life at work, home, and getting time for 
yourself may mean exercise falls to the bottom of the priority list, 
never to be seen again. When it comes to your body, you either 
use it or lose it.
Yes, you’ve grown a gut and your partner may be teasing you 
about potential man boobs. Retaliating by pointing out her saggy 
boobs and stretch marks may boost your ego (temporarily) but 
won’t do anything to help you get fit now — and may have you 
sleeping on the couch. So time once more to man up to a big task 
and get on with it.
Try the following:
»
» Check out gyms that offer child care and take the whole 
family.
»
» Get off the bus a few stops early and walk the rest of the way 
home. Park your car farther away from work, or walk or cycle 
to work. Skip the elevator and walk up and down the stairs.
»
» Involve your child in your exercise program. Stroller jogs; 
swimming lessons at the local pool; or exercising at home 
using your child as a weight, sitting on you while you do 
sit-ups or push-ups, are all great ways to incorporate her into 
your exercise program.

292      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Schedule some time into your week for exercise. Make 
exercise a priority, a promise to yourself that you can’t break. 
Take turns with your partner; one day she goes for a run, the 
next day you do.
»
» Team up with a few friends and get a personal trainer. 
There’s nothing like peer pressure and professional advice 
from a coach to get you in shape.
You are your child’s role model, so by making exercise and activ-
ity normal and a high priority in your own life, you’re making 
exercise normal and a high priority in her life.
Exercise with your child by
»
» Clambering over the monkey bars and climbing walls at 
your local playground with her — if you’re physically up to 
the task.
»
» Doing chores around the house. Vacuuming, mowing the 
lawn, and washing the car can help you work up a sweat. Get 
your child to help — a good foundation for the day he can 
mow the yard himself.
»
» Getting a trampoline for the backyard. Jumping around for 
15 minutes gets your pulse up. Don’t get too tricky with your 
jumps; a trip to the ER won’t add to your overall fitness.
»
» Going for walks (short ones at the beginning). Encourage 
your child to walk by himself rather than be carried.
»
» Having a pillow fight or a bit of rough-housing to get all the 
muscles working!
»
» Showing her how to climb trees; again, know your limitations.
»
» Signing up to coach a sport at your local school and having 
your child come along to play too.
Workout routines
Can you imagine your toddler or preschooler doing aerobics, or 
being able to follow what a weightlifting class instructor is say-
ing? Not likely. Working out with your child should be fun, not 

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      293
a stream of complicated instructions to follow. You can use the 
activities listed earlier as your workout routines, or try more 
traditional exercises with weights (for you, teddy bears for your 
child) and set moves. Here are some tips to make working out 
work out smoothly:
»
» Don’t eat just before exercise and especially not before 
swimming.
»
» Explain how important it is to warm up, stretch, and drink 
water.
»
» Give lots of praise and encouragement. If he can’t master an 
exercise yet, show him how and encourage him to do it 
himself. Helping his body through an exercise shows him he 
can do it.
»
» Make doing exercise together a regular activity — say, after 
day care or before dinner — so that your child looks forward 
to exercise and it becomes part of his routine.
»
» Start off slowly. A quarter of an hour of exercise is a good 
way to start.
Practicing yoga and meditation
Yoga is an ancient method of not only strengthening the body 
and maintaining physical well-being but also maintaining mental 
well-being. The practice consists of moving into poses by using 
breath and movement. Yoga encourages flexibility, stamina, and 
relaxation for general good health, including stress relief.
And what better time to start practicing yoga than when you 
have a frisky toddler or preschooler to entertain? Though a young 
child’s attention span may not cater to long sessions of yoga or 
deep meditation, there are a lot of poses you and your tyke can do 
at home, or you may want to enroll her in a class specializing in 
children’s yoga.
Many yoga poses are named after animals or things found  
in nature. Children often enjoy imagining they really are a  
dolphin when doing the dolphin pose or have the roots of a 
­thousand-year-old oak when practicing the tree pose.

294      PART 4  The Preschool Years
The best way to get started is by enrolling in a yoga-for-children 
course. And don’t think for a minute that yoga for children is too 
easy for you. You can do lots of poses along with your child, and 
they are just as challenging for you to do. In fact your child will 
probably do many poses better than you, which is a great source 
of motivation. Keep up with your toddler so he doesn’t call you 
“old man” (just yet).
Coping with Common  
Health Problems
There’s no more scary time than when your little one comes down 
with something and you’re not sure what’s happening. Before 
your child can speak and tell you what the matter is, you have only 
your innate dad-sense to tell you what the trouble is. So we’ve 
made it a little easier by laying out for you some basic health 
issues you’ll probably have to delve into sometime or another.
Childhood illnesses
At times it may seem that every couple of weeks your child is 
struck down with a cold — or worse, an ear or chest infection. 
As your child’s immunity is still developing and he spends more 
time in the company of other children, he’s going to pick up a 
lot of nasty illnesses. The list in this chapter covers the “usual 
suspects” of childhood illnesses. Chapter  17 examines what to do 
when you find out your child may have a serious or rare illness.
Following are some of the most common childhood illnesses to 
watch out for and what you can do about them.
Bronchiolitis
An acute (usually viral) chest infection, bronchiolitis usually 
comes after a cold, ear infection, or tonsillitis. It affects the small 
airways in the lungs called bronchioles.

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      295
»
» Symptoms: A hacking cough, difficulty breathing, and 
wheezing. Sometimes a child’s lips or tongue turn blue, a 
dangerous sign that he’s not getting enough oxygen. Some 
children vomit. Children can be ill for seven to ten days.
»
» Treatment: Keep your child well hydrated. Because bronchi-
olitis is viral, in mild cases there is no drug treatment. Severe 
cases may require hospitalization. See your doctor if you’re 
concerned.
»
» Precautions: Watch for secondary bacterial infections, 
which can be treated with antibiotics. If the bronchiolitis 
symptoms don’t go away as quickly as predicted by your 
pediatrician, or new symptoms, such as flu symptoms, 
appear, go back to your doctor or hospital. They may 
diagnose a secondary infection. If your child turns blue or is 
struggling to breathe, call 911 immediately!
Chickenpox
Chickenpox usually affects children and is a viral illness that can 
be transmitted through coughing and sneezing, or from touch-
ing one of the fluid blisters that appear on the skin of a patient. 
Having chickenpox usually provides long-lasting immunity to 
the disease, and only rarely have people had chickenpox twice. In 
adults, chickenpox can result in complications such as shingles.
»
» Symptoms: Cold and flu-like symptoms — runny nose, 
cough, tiredness and fever. A rash of small round lumps 
appears, which a few days later are replaced by itchy, 
fluid-filled blisters. The blisters tend to appear more on 
the torso, stomach, and back, but they can also form on the 
extremities, the inside of the mouth, the scalp, and the face.
»
» Treatment: Applying topical lotions to the blisters can help 
with the itch, but bed rest, acetaminophen for pain and 
fever, and not scratching are recommended.
»
» Precautions: Let your day care or preschool, friends, and 
family know that your child has chickenpox, because it’s 
contagious for about five days before the first symptoms 
appear.

296      PART 4  The Preschool Years
You can now get your child immunized against chickenpox. Look-
ing after a child with chickenpox is horrendous and quite a nasty 
experience for her too, so consider having her immunized, even if 
you have to pay for it.
You may have heard of the concepts of a “chickenpox party.” The 
idea behind chickenpox parties is to purposefully expose children 
to another child who has chickenpox to get the inevitable infection 
out of the way. We don’t believe this is a fantastic idea as chicken-
pox can be very severe — and in a few cases, life-threatening —  
so it should not be treated lightheartedly. Immunization may be 
a better alternative.
Common cold
A cold is a viral infection, mainly affecting the nose and throat 
and lasting from two to three days to a week.
»
» Symptoms: Runny nose, nasal congestion, weepy eyes, sore 
throat, tiredness, cough, sneezing, and fever.
»
» Treatment: Bed rest and fluids, along with a cool-mist 
vaporizer. Acetaminophen can be used for pain and fever. 
Ask your doctor before using chest rubs or any other 
over-the-counter medications to alleviate coughing.
»
» Precautions: If your child doesn’t get better over three to 
four days, see your pediatrician. There may be a secondary 
infection like an ear infection or worse on the way. If your 
child has a fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a 
strange cry, or a very sore throat, call the pediatrician.
Conjunctivitis
Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the 
tissue that lines the eyes. A range of things cause conjunctivitis — 
allergens in the air, a bacterial or viral infection, food allergies, or 
a blocked tear duct. If your child’s case of conjunctivitis is caused 
by an infection, it can be very contagious, so wash your hands after 
touching your child so you don’t come down with it as well! Keep 
your child away from day care and tell staff about the infection.

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      297
»
» Symptoms: Red, sore eyes and possibly green or yellow 
mucus at the corners.
»
» Treatment: Wash your child’s eyes with a disposable cotton 
ball dipped in clean water. Wash and dry your hands after 
doing this to curb infection spreading to you. A doctor can 
prescribe eye drops or ointment.
»
» Precautions: Wash bedding, clothing, towels, and wash-
cloths in hot water with some disinfectant to curb further 
infection or reinfection.
Ear infection
Children under 7 years old are particularly prone to ear infections, 
which occur when germs get into the middle ear. Pus and fluid can 
build up in the eardrum, making your little one pretty miserable.
Deal with ear infections promptly because fluid can remain in the 
ear, which can make it hard for your child to hear, and therefore 
listen and learn.
»
» Symptoms: Ear infections are pretty distressing for young 
ones. Your child will be cranky, rub his ears, and not want to 
lie down for sleep or diaper changes. Ear infections can 
coincide with colds, the flu, and chest infections. Older 
children will tell you the ear feels full, and in severe cases the 
eardrum can burst. Don’t waste time — see your pediatrician 
because you need to get confirmation of an ear infection 
from a healthcare professional.
»
» Treatment: Pain relief like ibuprofen and acetaminophen 
can help. Antibiotics can help when the infection is caused by 
bacteria, but not with viral ear infections, so see your 
pediatrician. Raising the head of the bed slightly can help 
too. Your child won’t be able to hear well, so keep back-
ground noise down so he can hear you.
»
» Precautions: Recurring ear infections may mean more drastic 
action needs to be taken. Doctors can put ear tubes — small 
tubes inserted in the eardrum to allow airflow and drainage 
between the inner and outer ear — in children’s ears to 
prevent fluid build-up.

298      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Gastroenteritis
Bacteria and viruses can attack the gut, causing a tummy bug. 
Gastroenteritis can happen because of a range of causes, from not 
washing hands properly after using the toilet or changing a diaper 
to food poisoning.
»
» Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, body 
pains, fever, nausea, and in extreme cases, diarrhea with 
blood or mucus.
»
» Treatment: Losing fluids through vomiting and diarrhea 
means you have to be careful that dehydration doesn’t 
occur, so make sure your child is drinking plenty of fluids.
»
» Precautions: Refusing to eat is less of a worry (in medical 
terms) than dehydration. However, refusing to eat is an 
indicator that something may not be right. Monitoring your 
child’s temperature and ensuring she has plenty of fluid 
intake when she’s ill is always the priority. If you see blood in 
your child’s stool, call your pediatrician immediately.
See your doctor right away if your child becomes very weak, is 
overly sleepy, has difficulty breathing, vomits, develops a high 
fever, has very dry skin or sunken eyes, doesn’t want to eat her 
favorite food, or stops passing urine.
Meningitis
Meningitis is a very serious disease in which the meninges, or 
­protective membranes of the brain and spinal cord, become 
infected and inflamed (swollen). Meningitis often comes on very 
fast and can be fatal or cause severe disability if not treated. 
There are different kinds of meningitis, but the most well-known 
is caused by the meningococcal bacteria. Meningitis is passed 
through coughing, sharing eating utensils or cups and glasses, 
or being in close contact with a carrier. Many people carry the 
meningococcal bacteria but don’t develop symptoms. Familiarize 
yourself with the symptoms of meningitis. You need to constantly 
be on the watch for these symptoms because the disease develops 
so quickly and is potentially fatal.

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      299
»
» Symptoms: Severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to 
light and loud noises, frequent crying with a high-pitched cry, 
refusing food or feedings, vomiting, fever, or a rash with 
blotchy skin or red and purple spots. The onset of symptoms 
can be very fast. Your child may have an unusual cry or be 
very sleepy.
»
» Treatment: See your doctor immediately if you suspect 
meningitis. Call an ambulance if you can’t see your doctor 
immediately. Your child can become seriously ill very quickly, 
so don’t second-guess yourself — get to the doctor or 
hospital!
»
» Precautions: Vaccines can help prevent some types of 
bacterial meningitis. Check out www.cdc.gov/meningitis/
index.html.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is a disease in which the air sacs of the lungs become 
infected.
»
» Symptoms: A wheezy or rattling cough, rapid breathing, 
making a noise when breathing, or having a hard time 
breathing. Your child may be very tired and look really 
unwell. Viral pneumonia starts out like a cold, while bacterial 
pneumonia can cause a fever as well.
»
» Treatment: Go to your pediatrician. Keep your child 
hydrated with fluids.
»
» Precautions: Pneumonia makes it hard for people suffering 
from the disease to get oxygen, so your child may look very 
pale, even a little blue, and be very sleepy. If this happens, 
see your doctor immediately, because your child needs more 
oxygen urgently.
Tonsillitis
Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils, which are two lit-
tle slits at the back of the throat, one on each side. Tonsils can 
become extremely sore and covered in pus. Symptoms can go on 

300      PART 4  The Preschool Years
for four to six days. Tonsillitis can be caused by the streptococcus 
bacteria and can be highly contagious.
»
» Symptoms: Tonsils become red, sore, and swollen, and 
sometimes secrete pus. Your child may also have flu 
symptoms like tiredness, fever, muscle aches, and swollen 
glands in the neck.
»
» Treatment: Visit your pediatrician. Antibiotics can sort out a 
case of strep-caused tonsillitis. However, if the disease is 
viral, bed rest, fluids, and ibuprofen or acetaminophen for 
pain relief are your best bet. Because your child’s throat will 
be very sore, eating cold, soft foods like gelatin is best. 
Gargling with warm salt water can clear any pus build-up.
»
» Precautions: Some children have recurring bouts of 
tonsillitis, which may result in having their tonsils removed 
surgically.
Whooping cough
Also known as pertussis, whooping cough is easily preventable 
because vaccines have been available in most communities for 
years. Whooping cough has three stages and can last many weeks, 
even up to three months. The defining characteristic of whooping 
cough is the cough with a “whoop” at the end, but it’s no whoop-
ing matter — the cough is nasty and will make your child pretty 
miserable for the duration of the illness.
»
» Symptoms: The first stage, which lasts about a week, 
includes a hacking cough at night, loss of appetite, sneezing, 
and possibly a slight fever. The second stage lasts about 
another week and is characterized by the horrendous 
coughing spells ending with the loud “whoop.” Your child 
may cough up lots of mucus, which may make her vomit. 
Sometimes children can stop breathing during these spells, 
so keep them close to you for monitoring. The third stage is 
usually when things are on the mend, though watch for 
secondary infections like ear and chest infections.
»
» Treatment: Go to the pediatrician. Some children need to 
be hospitalized. Small meals and lots of fluids are important, 
as is lots of love for your little one while she gets through the 

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      301
illness. Antibiotics may be prescribed. Steam and humidifiers 
can be used, but talk to your doctor.
»
» Precautions: Keep your child at home for three weeks from 
the start of the illness, or for five days after starting antibiot-
ics to prevent infecting other children.
Infants too young to have been vaccinated against whooping 
cough may become very ill, so if your child or someone else in 
your family has whooping cough, stay away from infants.
If your child is treated at home, take turns with family and friends 
to stay up at night to monitor your child because the cough is 
often worse at night.
Recurring health problems:  
Where to go from here?
Children under 5 have an average of six to eight respiratory tract 
infections (or colds) a year. The range in the number of infections 
children have is huge, though; while some children can get away 
with no infections at all, other children can have many.
Kids get sick so often because they
»
» Catch bugs from other children, and their immune system is 
still developing and getting up to speed trying to fight all the 
bugs around
»
» Could have an overactive or an underactive immune system
»
» May have problems with the way they are put together 
anatomically, such as circulation problems, broken skin, and 
obstructions in the ears and lungs
You can’t influence some of the factors cited previously, but you 
can do your bit to help your little one stay healthy. For example:
»
» Check that your child is adequately dressed for the weather 
when playing outside. For example, in windy weather make 
sure she wears a hat. Take an extra set of clothes so you can 

302      PART 4  The Preschool Years
change them quickly if they get wet or put on an extra layer 
if the temperature drops suddenly.
»
» Ensure room temperatures at home (and in her bedroom) 
are close to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
­recommendation — 66 degrees Fahrenheit. Go easy on air 
conditioning near children and avoid drafts.
»
» Keep up general hygiene standards such as washing hands 
after going to the toilet or petting animals, especially before 
touching food or eating. Teach your child not to pick up 
things from the floor and put them in her mouth.
If you think the number of times your child is ill, or the severity of 
your child’s recurring illness, is unusual or excessive, talk to your 
pediatrician. There may be an anatomical or immune issue here 
that you can treat.
Alternative medicines  
and ­remedies
Some dads seeking help with their children’s illnesses sometimes 
turn to the less beaten track by checking out alternative medicine. 
Many of these treatments look at preventing or curing illness 
through examining the whole person rather than just the disease. 
Types of alternative care include
»
» Acupuncture: An ancient Chinese technique where special 
needles are inserted at pressure points in the body
»
» Essential oils: Using plant oils to promote general well-being 
and help with illnesses
»
» Homeopathy: Using plant extracts to treat illness and 
promote well-being
»
» Massage: Using touch to relax muscles and stimulate blood 
flow around the body
»
» Naturopathy: An alternative medical system that uses the 
body’s ability to heal itself
»
» Osteopathy or chiropractic: Treating the body with 
manipulation of the musculoskeletal system

CHAPTER 14  Health and Nutrition      303
Many of these techniques may be beneficial for your child. How-
ever, they’re generally not designed to replace primary care, so a 
trip to your pediatrician is still a good idea even if you swear by 
the benefits of the various alternative approaches. There are also 
some things to be aware of when turning to alternative medicine 
to treat your child:
»
» Check the use of alternative medicine beforehand with your 
pediatrician or hospital. Many alternative therapies are 
unproven and unregulated, and some could cause harm.
»
» Some herbal remedies may contain allergens. Read labels 
carefully. Some can cause high blood pressure and liver 
damage. Check with your pediatrician if in doubt.
We have listed the preceding techniques and remedies for the sake 
of completeness and because some of them are very common. 
The effectiveness of alternative medicines and remedies in many 
cases has not been scientifically proven.
Child obesity
Obesity is a serious problem in the United States, affecting 17 percent 
of children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 19. Around 
one in three children is either overweight or obese. Obese children 
are prone to many of the same health problems as obese adults, 
including type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol levels, high blood pres-
sure, sleep apnea, liver abnormalities, and joint problems. Obese 
children are also more likely to have low self-esteem, to be teased 
at school, and to suffer from depression — things that no parent 
wants his child to have to deal with.
Obese parents are more likely to have obese children. Both genetic 
and environmental factors play a part in this. Although you can’t 
control your child’s genetic background, you can control his 
­environment — and your own weight. Limiting non-nutritious 
snacks and encouraging exercise will help your whole family 
maintain a normal weight and better health.

304      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Your child’s pediatrician can tell you whether your child’s weight 
is rising above a healthy limit. Take weight issues seriously, 
ignore your great-grandma when she tells you that a fat child is 
a healthy child, and start building a healthy lifestyle when your 
child is young. He’ll thank you for it later.
A word on health insurance
Healthcare insurance generally covers well visits for young 
­children as well as immunizations. Government programs can 
help with child health expenses if your income falls below a 
­certain level. If you have medical insurance for yourself already, 
talk to your insurer about adding your child to your policy as soon 
as he’s born.
If your child is seriously ill and you need to take time off work to 
look after him, find information about the Family and ­Medical 
Leave Act, commonly known as FMLA. Check out www.dol.gov/
whd/fmla/ for more information on what is and isn’t covered 
under FMLA.

Understanding different schooling 
philosophies
Getting your child ready for school
Finding out about complementary 
education
Getting an 
Education
S
chool is a major part of your child’s life for the next 
12 years — or more. Into adulthood, her school days shape 
her ­decisions, her values, and her way of thinking, not just 
the qualifications she earns or the things she knows. As a dad, you 
obviously want to get the best schooling for your children. This 
may mean a focus on academic achievement, on a holistic view of 
the child as a well-rounded individual, or on spiritual and reli-
gious elements important to your culture or ethnic background.
Your child’s school should also be somewhere you feel comfort-
able so that you can stay connected to your child and involved 
in her school life as much as possible. Research shows that the 
­better the student’s family support and involvement, the better 
she performs at school.
In this chapter we lay out all the options you have in navigating 
the education landscape, from private and pricy prep schools to 
public or religious schools, and give you some tools to help decide 
which is best for your child.

306      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Exploring Education Philosophies
When you were a kid, wasn’t school just a place that you went to 
down the road? These days we know a lot more about how a good 
education determines the path your life will take, and therefore 
there’s a lot more pressure on parents, and in some cases on dads, 
to get it right.
Understanding education choices
Lots of choices in schools are available, and trying to pick the best 
school for your child can be baffling. Here’s a look at what there 
is to choose from.
In the United States, you have a choice of
»
» Alternative schools: Schools such as Montessori or 
Waldorf, which stress creativity and more independent 
learning than most public schools.
»
» Public schools: Publicly funded schools in your local area. In 
most cases, your child will go to an assigned school, usually 
but not always the school nearest you.
»
» Private schools: Schools where you pay fees for your child’s 
tuition. The majority are Catholic schools or other religiously 
based schools.
»
» Preparatory schools: Schools where you pay fees for your 
child’s tuition and where your child has to make the cut to go 
there. Many have a religious affiliation, usually Protestant.
»
» Single-sex schools: Some schools admit only boys or girls. 
These schools aren’t common in the United States, but they 
do exist, more often in private than public schools.
To help you make your decision about which school your child 
should go to, it may help to ask yourself these questions:
»
» Besides getting good grades, what else is important at this 
school? Are there sports teams, language classes, or music 

CHAPTER 15  Getting an Education      307
facilities that you would like to encourage your child to get 
involved with?
»
» Can you afford to send your child to a private school? Private 
schools cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars a year to 
more than $10,000 per year.
»
» Do you feel happy and confident about coming in to talk to 
teachers and the principal? Do you like the vibe when you 
walk into the school?
»
» How practical is it to get your child to the school and back? 
Are long journeys by car, bus, or train involved? Is the school 
en route to work or a long way out of your work travel route?
»
» What are the school’s values and teaching philosophies? Do 
they match your values and philosophies?
Spend some time at the school if you can. Ask yourself if you like 
the atmosphere, the way the teachers and children respond to each 
other, and the children there. Are the children precocious, spoiled, 
respectful, or meek? Ask teachers why they became a teacher. Is 
teaching their “calling,” or is it simply a job they ended up in 
because other career options didn’t work out?
Alternative education 
­philosophies
If public school philosophies, with their emphasis on reading, 
writing, and ’rithmetic, aren’t your thing, you do have alter-
natives. Both Montessori and Waldorf methods aim to educate 
­children in a holistic way, shaping the child to be a good person 
with strong values and a sense of self.
Montessori
Developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in 1907, this approach involves 
observing and following the child’s interests and encouraging 
him to explore and learn at his own pace. Here are the basics:
»
» Children are separated into age groups 0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 
and 12–14 years.

308      PART 4  The Preschool Years
»
» Learning environments are designed so children can explore 
and have lots of specially designed materials to encourage 
skills and development that are easily manipulated by children. 
Classrooms are very calm, ordered places, where children 
learn to respect the space and needs of their classmates. 
Children are taught to put things back where they belong 
so others can use them.
»
» Montessori believed that with the right environment and 
freedom to explore, children develop a love of work, order, 
and silence, and grow to become independent, self-disciplined 
adults who are true to their natures.
»
» Older children are encouraged to be role models and 
support younger children.
Check the website www.montessori-namta.org/School-Directory 
for a list of Montessori schools to see if there’s one near you.
Waldorf/Rudolf Steiner
Rudolf Steiner was an Austrian philosopher who founded the 
school of thought called anthroposophy. Without getting too tech-
nical here, Steiner’s schools (sometimes called Waldorf because 
that was the name of the first school) use the concept of imagina-
tion and creative thinking to develop children into free-thinking 
adults. Steiner schools regard the child’s inner life as important 
as learning to read, write, and do math. Here are the basics:
»
» Childhood is divided into three parts: early childhood, where 
emphasis is put on learning through experience; elementary 
age, where emphasis is put on the child’s spirit; and adoles-
cence, where emphasis is on developing analytical and 
abstract thinking skills.

Private versus public
For some fathers, whether you send your child to private or public 
school comes down to finances — you can either afford the fees, 
or you can’t.
Many factors affect a child’s performance at school. The most 
important factor is the child’s background — the place he comes 
from and the support he receives from family and the community. 
More children from well-off backgrounds go to private schools, 
and those schools may perform better than some public schools. 
Private schools may send more children to college, although this 
doesn’t always hold true. When considering which school to send 
your child to, ask yourself these questions:
»
» Do I want my child to be educated in a religious setting? If 
yes, private schools of your denomination are for you.
»
» Do I want my child to have access to a large range of 
extracurricular activities? If yes, check out the programs 
offered at the public and private schools around you. Private 
schools have scholarships for young people who excel in 
sports.
»
» What value do I place on cultural diversity? Private schools 
may have fewer children of minority backgrounds.
Talk to other parents and students at the school you’re looking at. 
They are the best gauge of a school.

Same-sex versus co-ed
Girls and boys learn in different ways. Boys learn better when 
they stand up and are active; girls learn well in a structured/ 
formal setting. So the idea of separating boys and girls to have a 
more effective learning experience seems pretty straightforward.
That said, experts are divided on the effectiveness of single-sex 
schools. Principals at single-sex schools claim that without the 
distraction of the opposite sex around, students get on with learn-
ing and girls are more likely to come out of their shells a bit. Those 
who champion co-educational schools say that there are social 
advantages in having the opposite sex around on a daily basis.
But that doesn’t help you dads, does it? Perhaps this is something 
you’d like to talk about with your child. She may have a pref-
erence, and you can always check with parents whose children 
attend single-sex or co-ed schools. Ask yourself the same ques-
tions we suggest for checking out schools in general: Does this 
school reflect your family values? How comfortable are you about 
this school?
Starting School
Welcome to a whole new world — the world of school! Going to 
school is a big milestone in any child’s life. Be sure to take lots of 
pictures and enjoy seeing your child in his new environment. As 
his role model, if you enjoy school and being there with him, he’ll 
love it too.
In the United States, the school year runs from late August or early 
September to May or June, and the academic year is ­generally 
divided into two semesters, although this may vary, depending on 
where you live. There are short breaks between semesters, with a 
longer break of roughly 10 weeks over the summer.
Preparing for school
If your child has been to day care or preschool, he has some experi-
ence with being around lots of other children and teachers without 

CHAPTER 15  Getting an Education      311
you, and the transition to school may be quite straightforward. On 
the other hand, going to school is also a new environment. Big-
ger kids will be there, he may be riding the school bus for the first 
time, and he may be quite scared about all the changes in his life 
right now. There’s also the fact that this is school, which is such a 
big milestone in his life that you’ll undoubtedly be feeling all sorts 
of emotions — your little person is growing up!
Day care centers and preschools take part in getting your child 
prepared for school, emotionally and educationally. Just like when 
you were settling your child into day care or preschool, taking 
your child to school and staying with him for visits will help him 
adjust and become familiar with his new surroundings. Talking 
together about what happens at school, what playtime is, what 
happens during the day, and where his bag goes will also help him 
be less overwhelmed by the change in his life.
Tell your little one what it was like for you when you were in 
school (hopefully you still remember some details!). Show him 
photos if you have some and get him excited about school by 
­telling a few tall tales of your own school days.
Most schools have an orientation day for new students before your 
child starts school. As well as helping your child, the ­orientation 
day also helps you be more at home in his new school, which 
is important. Studies show that fathers who are comfortable at 
a school are more likely to be actively involved in their child’s 
education.
School vacations come around quickly, and you need a plan for 
when your child doesn’t have to go to school for a while. Plan 
well ahead by arranging with your partner or family who will look 
after junior during the holidays or on the inevitable sick days.
Things kids need to know  
about school
Imagine you’re starting a new job. You turn up at your new office 
and are shown your desk and a stack of work to do. And that’s it. You 
don’t know where the bathrooms are, where to make a cup of coffee, 
what time lunch is, where meetings are held, or what time you call 
it a day. You’d be feeling pretty out to sea if this happened to you, 

312      PART 4  The Preschool Years
and your child will feel the same. She may find going to school and 
settling into a new environment overwhelming if she doesn’t get a 
heads-up from you about what’s going to happen, so here are a few 
things you may have overlooked that your child needs to know:
»
» Let her know that asking questions if she’s not sure of 
anything is okay. There are always teachers and teacher 
aides around who can help.
»
» Explain the school rules — no hitting, no running with 
scissors, no stealing, and other good rules.
»
» Give your child a rough guide to the day’s structure: There’ll 
be a playtime and lunchtime, if your school has all-day 
kindergarten.
»
» Explain that only the people she knows well, such as Dad, 
Mom, and special relatives and friends, should take her 
home from school. Most schools today have very strict rules 
about who can pick up children.
»
» Tell her that school is on every day except weekends.
»
» Make sure she knows that looking after her bag, clothing, 
and lunch box is her responsibility. Dad won’t be able to run 
around finding stuff for her at going-home time, especially if 
she takes a bus home.
»
» Show her how to go to the toilet and wash her hands by 
herself.
»
» Be sure she understands that the teacher is in charge of the 
class. If she needs something, she should ask the teacher.
You can help the transition to school by saying hello to the teacher 
every morning and stopping to talk to any children or parents that 
you know. Goodbyes should be short, however. Say “goodbye” 
and “I love you,” give a quick kiss, and let the teacher — a trained 
professional in these matters — take over.
Your child will be really tired from school in the first few weeks, so 
let her have some time to herself and a snack after school before 
making her do any chores. Show lots of interest, though, and be 
prepared to listen when your growing little one is ready to tell you 
about her exciting day at school.

CHAPTER 15  Getting an Education      313
Just as when you leave your child with a babysitter or when you’ve 
taken her to day care or kindergarten, your child may be a bit 
clingy when you leave her at school on the first day. To get around 
this “return of separation anxiety,” make sure your child is with 
an adult, such as a teacher or teacher aide, or an older child like 
a cousin or friend when you leave. Give her a big kiss and a hug, 
and tell her you love her. Say something like “I’ll be back after 
school” or “see you later” and walk away. Don’t draw out the 
goodbye. Your child is in good hands in school, and she’ll be just 
fine starting her journey to becoming an independent adult. Be 
there for your child when she needs you — walk her into class and 
be there to pick her up.
Homework with dad
Along with schoolwork comes homework, where the day’s learn-
ing is reinforced. You may be surprised that homework starts as 
early as kindergarten. Just like when your child was a baby and 
you repeated things over and over for him to learn, your child 
needs a second try at what he learned that day to make it stick in 
his head. But finding a child who likes doing his homework is as 
rare as hens’ teeth, so here are some ways to make homework less 
of a battle and more conducive to learning:
»
» If he’s using the Internet to do research for a project, monitor 
where he’s getting his information. There are a lot of 
unreliable sites out there.
»
» Let your child do his homework independently, but let him 
know you’re there to help should he need it. If reading books 
is part of the homework, read them with him to help him 
with new words.
»
» Let your child have some down time after school and before 
homework starts. Go outside and kick a ball around or water 
the garden together. Then get into the homework.
»
» Make a set time for homework. Homework isn’t finished until 
he has it in his bag, ready to go to school tomorrow.
»
» Set aside a quiet space where your child can do his home-
work. Turn off the TV or music — they are distractions.

314      PART 4  The Preschool Years
You remember what doing homework was like, so don’t be too hard 
on your child. If you see him struggling with something, spend 
some extra time with him. You don’t need to do the ­homework 
for him (and in fact that would be detrimental to the learning 
objectives), but inspire him by looking at different approaches to 
overcoming an obstacle he may be facing. Doing homework with 
your child is really no different than coaching — help him do a 
good job himself without doing the job for him.
Special dads for special needs
The term “special needs” covers a wide range of issues that some 
children face, from physical difficulties such as disease or dis-
ability, to mental, behavioral, and emotional issues that affect the 
way they learn. Just as all children are unique, so are the problems 
they may face, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it 
comes to children with special needs.
Some examples of disorders and disabilities that may require 
­special education include:
»
» Children who are hearing or visually impaired, who are 
wheelchair bound, or who have chronic illnesses like cystic 
fibrosis
»
» Children with autism, attention deficit disorder, fetal alcohol 
syndrome, developmental delay, Down Syndrome, or 
Tourette Syndrome
For some fathers, it’s obvious that their children need special 
help with their education. For others, it may just be a feeling that 
something isn’t quite right. As always, talk to your child’s health-
care provider or teachers.
Recognizing that your child needs special help with her education 
doesn’t mean she’ll be packed off to a Dickensian school where 
she’ll be left to languish. In some instances, children can attend 
mainstream school with the help of a teacher aide, while others 
may flourish at a special needs school.
Fathers must be strong advocates for their children — be informed 
and willing to go the extra distance to get your child the educa-
tional opportunities she deserves.

CHAPTER 15  Getting an Education      315
If you’re concerned about your child’s education and feel she may 
need access to special education services, here are some places to 
start. The U.S. Department of Education’s website at www2.ed.gov/
about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html can provide infor-
mation on different types of programs. Your state government 
education website can provide more detailed information on what 
programs are mandated by your state.
When schools don’t meet  
your expectations
If you have any concerns about the education your child is receiv-
ing, there are issues with how your child is settling in, or you have 
any concerns at all with your child’s school, make an appointment 
to see his teacher or principal. Talking it through may bring to 
light some issues you weren’t aware of that you can address, or 
vice versa for the school.
If issues such as bullying or questionable standards of teaching 
continue and you still aren’t happy with the school, it may be time 
to look at what other schooling options are out there that may be 
a better fit for your child.
Wherever your child goes to school, your attitude and role 
­modeling are most important as a father. Keep reading to your 
child and encouraging him to do his homework, talk about his 
day, and become a part of your child’s education. You’re still the 
most important part of his learning.
Choosing Extracurricular 
Activities
Many people had a whole lot of extracurricular activities going 
on when they were growing up. Today there are more and more 
classes and courses that your child can do to complement the 
learning she does at school.

316      PART 4  The Preschool Years
The best time to start on subjects like language and music is now. 
As they get older and don’t have the absorbent brains they used 
to have, many adults have regretted not learning an extra skill, 
such as music, in their youth. But before you enroll junior in every 
class under the sun, ask her what she would like to do and follow 
whatever her interests are, rather than your own.
Learning languages
Languages other than English form part of the school curriculum 
depending on where you live. But the languages taught at your 
school may not be what your child wants to learn, or you may 
have a passion for a particular place and will be visiting there a 
lot, making learning that language important.
Depending on where you live, private tutors are available to 
teach your child a language other than English. Word-of-mouth 
is often the best source for finding a language teacher, although 
putting the language you want your child to learn into your 
search engine can also help you find someone who works with 
children. Many schools also teach foreign language, starting 
in the lower grades, but your child will have to learn the same  
language as everyone else.
Making music
Starting-school age is a great time to start learning to play an 
instrument. Your local paper or community noticeboard may have 
listings for local teachers.
Your local music store may offer certain types of music lessons 
or may maintain a list of local teachers. Word-of-mouth can be 
a good way to find music teachers who work well with young 
children.
Start small. Don’t expect your child to be able to handle a full 
drum kit or stand-up double bass just yet. Piano, guitar, violin, or 
wind instruments may be up your child’s alley. See what he would 
like to play. A great way to inspire junior is to go into a music 

CHAPTER 15  Getting an Education      317
store and show him the various instruments. Get the sales assis-
tant to put on a show so he gets to see them in action.
Many schools provide music education, usually starting with 
singing in the lower grades and moving up to simple instruments, 
such as recorders, played as a group, before starting individual 
instruments.
Playing sports
Getting your child involved in the sport of his choice is a great 
way to keep him active, give him goals, and show him how to 
play with others. Your child should decide which sport he wants 
to get involved with, because the main thing at this age is to enjoy 
the sport. If he’s not sure or can’t decide, watch some games, 
research the sport on the Internet, or if you happen to know how, 
show him how the sport’s played.
Sports can be organized through schools or clubs in your town. 
Traveling teams made up of kids from several districts are avail-
able for many sports, but your child will have to try out and make 
the cut.
Getting your child involved means more than just dropping him 
off at practices and games. Be ready to stay and watch — or even 
help coach. It’s a good way to get involved with other parents in 
your community.
Remember, though, that games are for the kids — not for adults 
who criticize the other team, yell at their own child every time he 
misses a play, or display generally bad sportsmanship. Bad sports 
run the risk of being tossed out of the viewing area, so practice 
holding your tongue during games and work on yelling only when 
you’re praising your team members — or even the other team, 
when they make a good play.
Many schools send home information on available local sports 
programs. If yours doesn’t, check with your township or city’s 
recreation department, which should be able to provide you with 
a list.

318      PART 4  The Preschool Years
Religious education
If your child’s not going to a school associated with a particu-
lar religious denomination, you may want him to have religious 
education outside the school environment. These classes are gen-
erally organized by local churches or places of worship, so they 
should be your first port of call.

Y
ou and your partner have made a decision — and it’s pretty 
radical. You’re going to stay home with the baby while your 
partner heads back to work or school. You’ll be the 
­number-one caregiver, taking care of your baby’s needs for the 
majority of the time. You’re about to board a new, scary roller 
coaster and, as any stay-at-home mom will tell you, a really 
rewarding one.
Stay-at-home dads (SAHDs) have yet to get much respect. 
­Millions of years of moms being primary caregivers means some 
people may still find it a little weird for dads to stay home and 
look after a baby. But the times, they are a-changin’, and just 
as women pursue careers and take on formerly male-dominated 
roles, men can make a change to what was once firmly female 
territory.
In this chapter we give you a list of the reasons why dads make 
great primary caregivers — you may want to carry it around with 
you to shoot down any naysayers — and give you some food for 

322      PART 5  What Happens When
thought on balancing your new full-time job with a little paid 
work on the side. We also give you the low-down on making the 
transition into your new role as smooth a ride as possible.
Daddy’s in Da House
According to the Pew Research Center, in 1989, 10 percent of 
males said that their main activity was “child-care/home duties.” 
By 2012, this proportion had risen to 16 percent. Of these dads, 
23 percent were at home because they couldn’t find work, while 
21 percent of SAHDs were staying at home specifically to take over 
child-rearing duties. Another 35 percent were home because they 
were ill or disabled, and 17 percent were students or retired. Those 
numbers are still relatively low, but they show that the phenom-
enon of the SAHD is on the increase.
Debunking some myths about 
guys as primary caregivers
Stay-at-home dads are a recent phenomenon, and lots of people 
don’t really understand what “stay-at-home dad” means. They’ll 
make judgments about you and your family, which can be hard to 
swallow sometimes. Here are some of the myths you may encounter:
»
» Fathers can’t parent as well as mothers until their child is 
older.
»
» Fathers can’t breastfeed babies, so the baby will miss out on 
breast milk.
»
» Fathers can’t handle looking after a baby without causing 
chaos in the house and leaving a mess wherever they go.
»
» Fathers won’t be able to handle being a SAHD at all.
»
» Fathers will forget practical things like food, diaper changes, 
and appropriate clothing.
»
» Fathers don’t have a “mother’s intuition” and won’t be able to 
tell if their child is unwell.

CHAPTER 16  Being a Stay-at-Home Dad      323
We say this is rubbish. Although fathers parent differently from 
mothers, it doesn’t mean dad’s way is wrong. To the skeptics, we 
say this:
»
» Showing love and wanting the best for their kids makes 
fathers just as qualified to look after their little ones as their 
mothers.
»
» Mothers can express breast milk for dads to give to their 
babies, or dads can feed formula if appropriate.
»
» Fathers can do everything moms can do, such as looking 
after the household in addition to looking after baby, even if 
they haven’t been doing it for as long as moms.
»
» Dads make fantastic parents. Active father involvement has 
been linked to improved performance at school and fewer 
problems during teen years such as teen pregnancy or binge 
drinking.
»
» Fathers aren’t dense. We can remember diaper changes and 
to do the washing. Figuring out our own way of doing things 
may take some work, but we get there.
»
» Fathers who spend time with their babies learn everything 
there is to know about their little ones, and are able to use 
their common sense and the tips they discover in this book 
to tell when baby is ill.
»
» Guys are very practical and often good at things that moms 
struggle with (and vice versa, of course). So dads have lots of 
useful skills they can transfer to raising their offspring from 
an early age.
Coping with your new career
As dads in the 21st century, chances are you were brought up to be 
the breadwinner and to provide financially for your children. This 
gender role goes right back to the days of the caveman — men 
went out to bring home the mammoth. Going from a full-time 
career to staying home with a baby is a big change — ask any 
first-time mom how she coped with it! And guys don’t have the 

324      PART 5  What Happens When
physical changes of pregnancy to prepare for how weird the whole 
parenthood thing is. But that could also be a blessing, of course!
Having a support system in place helps when it comes to your new 
career. Family, friends who have children, and other men who can 
remind you it’s not all about diapers, bottles, and crying can all 
provide support.
Being out of the politics of your office, without a demanding 
boss or several people to report to, can be nice. You don’t have 
any deadlines for reports or projects to manage. But on the other 
hand, the small new boss is a pretty demanding one, and if you 
don’t get the work done right — if you don’t burp that gas out, if 
you let her get overtired, or if you don’t have enough formula on 
hand — you’re going to be rapped on the knuckles pretty quickly. 
There is no clocking out at five o’clock, no one to take over the late 
shift, and hardest of all, no sick leave. When you’re the primary 
caregiver, the buck stops with you.
So how do you go from being a career man to being the main 
man at home? Remember that what you’re doing is a privilege and 
doing so will bring you much closer to your little person than you 
could ever have imagined. Why would you ever want to go back to 
work? The time that your child is small is so short, and he’ll never 
be this age again. Looking after a baby or toddler is tough work, 
and your career may have been important to you; however, there 
aren’t many men out there who have the same opportunity to be 
this close to their children. Enjoy it!
You’re never alone. Set up your own group of fathers and create a 
network of people you can call on. See our tips later in this chapter 
for networking as a SAHD.
Getting organized
Being organized when you have a child is essential. Having sys-
tems and routines in place that save you time and effort make life 
a lot easier, giving you time for the things you like to do rather 
than have to do.

CHAPTER 16  Being a Stay-at-Home Dad      325
Use your cellphone to keep track of baby supplies, to-do lists, 
appointments, and other jobs around the house. Most phones 
come with all the tools you need, or you can download specific 
applications to keep track. Nothing like a gadget to keep you 
focused!
Checking every night at bedtime to be sure you have the essentials 
for the next day will prevent you from finding you’ve run out of 
something really important.
Here’s a quick run-down on the essentials that you may want to 
have on hand:
»
» Clean diapers
»
» Food, whether it be expressed breast milk or formula for 
babies under six months, or solids and finger food for older 
babies
»
» Wipes or cloths for diaper changing
»
» Diaper cream
»
» Any medicine or ointments your child needs
»
» At least two changes of clothes
If you get out and about a lot, which we recommend, keep the 
diaper bag stocked at all times so loading up the stroller and going 
out isn’t a big deal.
Always take your diaper bag with you everywhere. Even a short 
trip to do the grocery shopping may require a diaper change, or 
circumstances may mean you’re away longer than you planned.
In the first few weeks of life, your baby may have a very busy 
appointment book — checkups with your midwife or doctor, 
vaccinations, or trips to a specialist. Keep a list or calendar of 
appointments in the early weeks so you don’t forget. You’ll be too 
tired to remember your own name, let alone when an appoint-
ment is coming up.
Some SAHDs plan out their weeks well in advance with activities 
such as swimming, playgroup, and story time at the local library. 
Use technology, such as your computer, laptop, or phone, to plan 

326      PART 5  What Happens When
your activities. Mom will be very impressed when you show her 
the schedule on your cellphone!
All that organization may sound boring right now, but children 
keep things interesting and generally respond well to a change 
of plans. Even if you’re adhering to a strict routine or schedule, 
children like to mix things up a bit. So what if you miss a swim-
ming lesson or don’t make it to music class? If something else 
turns up, that means you’ll have to change plans. It’s not worth 
panicking over.
My Daddy Just Cares for Me
If you’re the primary caregiver, the buck stops with you. Being the 
primary caregiver is like being the head of a major corporation, 
only you have one very demanding, unforgiving, but utterly cute 
client who pays you in smiles and love.
Figuring out what your  
baby wants
Trying to figure out what your baby is saying to you when he 
arches his back or screws up his face in a certain way is daunt-
ing. It can be baffling when he’s grumpy and cranky and nothing 
seems to settle him. You’re not a bad father; you just don’t have 
the skills to deal with each stage of your child’s life yet. By the 
way, stay-at-home moms face the same challenges.
Figuring out what your baby is trying to communicate is a matter 
of finding out what you don’t yet know. Fortunately, this is rela-
tively easy these days! Parenting classes are available to help you 
decipher your baby’s many cues and help you act on them. Par-
enting classes can also be an invaluable support network. You’ll 
meet other dads, hear what they’ve been experiencing, and get 
tips on how to deal with any issues you have with your fatherhood 
experience.

CHAPTER 16  Being a Stay-at-Home Dad      327
Healthy bodies and active minds
Just as your child needs food to grow her body, active movement 
and experiences feed her mind. When she was first born, her brain 
was about 15 percent developed, but by 3 years of age, her brain 
is well on its way to being fully developed. The first three years in 
particular shape your child’s life like no other period. By making a 
great connection with your child, giving her lots of opportunities 
to explore and learn, and lots of physical encouragement, you’re 
doing the best job a dad can do.
All those little things children do when they play — feeling tex-
tures, judging distances, figuring out what’s hot and cold, pour-
ing water from one cup to another, and making those raucous 
noises and squeals — is all about practicing skills that we adults 
have (almost) perfected. By offering lots of things to touch and 
play with, you’re giving your child lots of opportunities to get 
some practice in for the real deal — growing up and adulthood. 
See our other chapters on specific age groups for ways to get 
active with kids.
To ensure your child’s body stays as healthy as it can be, give 
your child lots of healthy and nutritious foods. You may also need 
to improve your cooking and baking skills in case you’re not a 
­natural-born chef. Remember the basics — avoid fatty, sugary 
foods; establish a feeding and eating routine; avoid distractions 
during eating; and ensure your child gets lots of rest and good 
sleep. For more on nutrition, see Chapter 14.
Keeping mom in the loop
In a busy household, where you’re at home with your child and 
your partner is out at work, it’s easy to fall into a trap where you’re 
so absorbed by the hectic lives you lead that you have no time for 
each other. You’re tired from chasing your little one all day and 
can’t wait to hand her over to your partner, who’s exhausted from 
meetings and deadlines. You may fall into a trap of thinking that 
spending time with your child is a chore.
Remembering that the three of you need to spend time together 
as a family and enjoy each other’s company is really important. 

328      PART 5  What Happens When
If your partner is away at the office and your child does some-
thing that would be of interest to her, let her know — send a 
text message or an image of your child to her. Have the video 
camera around to capture any new words or milestones your 
child reaches when your partner isn’t there. And when she comes 
home, rather than plopping your child on her lap the instant she 
walks through the door, have a family meal or a general catch-up 
on what the three of you have been doing all day.
As your child gets older, encourage him to do something special 
for his mom when she gets home, such as bringing her slippers or 
showing her a drawing he has made.
Working from home
You may decide to be a SAHD who works from home. If you’re 
used to working with a lot of people or in a busy environment, 
suddenly finding yourself at home with a child and a laptop to 
work with can be strange, lonely, and a little boring. You may be 
tempted to make yourself a cup of coffee every ten minutes, or feel 
unmotivated because you don’t have a work environment around 
you to keep that energy going. If you’re not self-­disciplined or 
motivated, chances are working from home is not going to be easy 
for you.
You can do things to stop yourself from going crazy or being so 
lonely that you invite the meter reader in for coffee:
»
» Have a routine for you and your child, so you can slot work in 
around when she sleeps. Having a structured routine allows 
you to more easily make appointments, schedule phone 
calls, or take part in online meetings. If possible, be flexible 
to allow for those days when your child’s unsettled.
»
» Don’t be too ambitious with what you can achieve. You’ll 
have days when you can’t get any work done and other days 
when your princess is a dream who sleeps for hours at a 
time. Overcommitting yourself to your boss will just stress 
you out and make your fathering life more difficult.
»
» Give yourself a few hours each day to get out and about — go 
for a walk or attend a planned activity like playgroup or 

CHAPTER 16  Being a Stay-at-Home Dad      329
swimming lessons. Most of all, use that time to see other 
people!
»
» If you have face-to-face meetings to attend, check ahead of 
time to see whether you can take your child, or arrange for a 
sitter, friend, or relative to cover for you.
»
» Be enthusiastic about the work you’re doing. Otherwise, you 
have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the stress of trying to 
do your job and be a SAHD (which is also a full-time job).
»
» Make a work space in your house that’s just for your work. 
By having your own work space, you don’t have to set up 
your gear every time you want to work. You’re more likely to 
settle into productive work if you don’t have to clear the 
breakfast dishes away from the dining table to work at it 
while baby is sleeping. When your child gets older, explain to 
him that this is daddy’s office and not an indoor playground.
The Brotherhood of Dads
There’s a reason why men in the armed services tend to call 
themselves bands of brothers — they look after one another as 
if they were blood relatives. The same can be kind of said about 
SAHDs — we’re on the front line of parenting, taking the hits 
(dirty diapers), outwitting the enemy (playing chase), fighting 
the good fight (rough-housing), and going the extra mile (in the 
stroller, when junior won’t go to sleep). The Brotherhood of Dads 
is all about camaraderie between fathers and ensuring that dads 
gather together and get through any good and bad times they may 
be experiencing.
Being at home means that you may become slightly isolated, but 
you can call on your brothers. See the following sections for the 
various ways you can get in touch with the brotherhood.
Networking as a SAHD
So how do you find these mythical brothers who are going to be 
your rocks when you need them? SAHDs are more common than 

330      PART 5  What Happens When
they used to be, but they’re still a rare beast, so keep your eyes 
peeled at the local library, music sessions, playgroups, and coffee 
groups, or just stroll up to other guys pushing strollers — you 
don’t need an excuse to start a conversation. You can also ask your 
healthcare provider if she has other SAHDs on her books or knows 
of any dad groups in the area.
Basically, just do what the moms do (but in a man kind of way). 
Get together with other SAHDs at a local coffee shop, go to child-
friendly movie sessions, or take turns meeting at each other’s 
homes. Moms do this all the time, and they are pretty good at it — 
no reason why dads can’t network too.
Being the only guy in the room
Because most primary caregivers are women, most of the activi-
ties that you take your child to, especially in his first year of life, 
are bound to be full of moms and babies. Being the only guy in 
the room can be a bit weird. Then again . . . it can be really cool 
because you’ll get lots of attention, and in our experience, most 
moms love the fact that there is a SAHD in the group to add some 
variety and dad-perspective. You may even be overrun with moms 
keen to find out about the male approach to parenting. Single 
moms may be especially grateful for exposure to male parenting. 
So enjoy the attention and show you can keep up with the best of 
the moms!

Dealing with serious illness and injury
Shedding light on terminal illness
Getting through — how to cope when a 
child dies
Serious Illness 
and Losing 
Your Baby
I
n an ideal world, we wouldn’t be writing this chapter and you 
wouldn’t be reading it. Your child should always be well, happy, 
and carefree. But unfortunately, life’s not that simple. Children 
do get ill, they get hurt, and sometimes they die.
When a person close to you dies, it’s heartbreaking. But it just 
doesn’t seem right that children should die before their ­parents — 
it’s not the natural order of things. In our culture, we tend to 
measure the impact of a tragedy against others — thinking, for 
example, that a sudden death is worse than a gradual one or that 
a miscarriage is less painful than losing a child at birth. In reality, 
that child’s loss will be felt greatly by his parents, no matter what 
the age or how it happens.

332      PART 5  What Happens When
Sometimes illness is unavoidable; sometimes it isn’t. In this 
chapter, we show you ways to minimize the risk of illness, start-
ing with pregnancy, and how to cope should serious illness 
strike. Lastly, we discuss terminal illness and getting through the 
unthinkable — when a child dies.
It may be hard to find the right words if someone close to you 
experiences the loss of a child. Take a look at americanpregnancy.
org/pregnancy-loss/supporting-others/.
Avoiding Health Problems
What you put in your body plays a big part in your health. ­Making 
your home a smoke-free environment and eating nutritious 
meals go a long way toward staying healthy (see Chapter 3 for 
more about healthy eating during pregnancy).
Protecting against diseases
Having your child immunized against diseases like whoop-
ing cough, meningitis, and diphtheria protects her from these 
­illnesses that can cause death or serious, long-term harm to a 
child. Talk to your child’s pediatrician about the right ages to have 
her vaccinated.
Providing a violence-free home
Shaking your baby or hitting your young child may cause seri-
ous physical harm or death in extreme cases. The message is 
­simple  — never, ever shake your baby, and consider discipline 
that doesn’t include hitting your child.
Beyond the physical harm shaking and hitting can cause, in the 
first years of your child’s life he’s learning to form a safe and 
secure attachment to you, his father, and this attachment plays a 
big part in how well he’ll act and form relationships as an adult. 

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      333
If you’re violent toward him, chances are he’ll be a violent person 
himself.
If you’re at the end of your rope and just feel like making your 
baby or child shut up, take a deep breath and count to ten, or leave 
him in a safe place and get some air for a minute. Stress is the 
distance between the situation in front of you and how well you 
think you can deal with that situation. Tell yourself you can do it 
and see how much better you’ll feel.
If you’re often angry at your child, your partner, or the situations 
you’re in, it may be time to get help dealing with your emotions.
Many therapists specialize in helping people with anger manage-
ment issues control their temper and express feelings without 
violence. Check the Internet for resources by typing in “Anger 
Management Therapists” for someone near you.
Keeping accidents at bay
Keeping your child physically safe around your home, in the 
street, and in your car is also really important. See Chapter 7 on 
childproofing your home and Chapter 4 for car seat safety.
Keep your child safe around roads by teaching her to hold your 
hand crossing the road at designated crosswalks and when you’re 
near driveways, and to never go in the road without an adult.
Giving your baby a healthy  
start to life
Doesn’t every child deserve the best start in life you can possibly 
give him? Keeping mom tanked up with healthy food, lots of fresh 
air, and gentle exercise from when you first know you’re going 
to be a dad goes a long way toward keeping your baby healthy in 
the long run.
Risks during pregnancy
Creating a whole new person is an enormous task, and pregnancy 
can make a woman’s body vulnerable to infection and conditions 

334      PART 5  What Happens When
such as high blood pressure. It’s also important to consider the 
effects of what your partner eats and is exposed to on the devel-
oping baby.
If your partner has any chronic health issues, such as diabetes 
or asthma, make sure both of you are happy with the way that 
your health provider is monitoring the progress of the pregnancy. 
If not, find a health provider you are happy with.
These are some of the things your partner should be aware of 
­during her pregnancy:
»
» Smoking: Pregnancy is a great time to take the plunge and 
quit smoking. Poisons from the smoke are passed to the 
baby through the placenta. Babies born to mothers who 
smoke are at risk of developing breathing problems and 
having a lower birth weight, and are twice as likely to die 
from SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). However, 
quitting smoking is tough and not made much easier by 
having a preachy dad-to-be around or one who continues to 
smoke himself. Instead, give your partner your wholehearted 
support and contact a helpline in your area, not just for your 
partner, but for both of you to quit smoking.
If you want to give up smoking, check out these sites for help 
and advice:
•	 American Cancer Society: www.cancer.org/healthy/
stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/
•	 American Lung Association: www.lung.org/
stop-smoking
»
» Alcohol: Experts are unsure of what a “safe” level of alcohol 
is for pregnant women, so it’s best to avoid all alcohol. Fetal 
alcohol syndrome is caused by alcohol crossing the placenta 
and affecting the baby’s developing brain. Children with fetal 
alcohol syndrome can have problems with learning, 
concentration, hyperactivity, and speech.
»
» Chickenpox: When we’re kids, chickenpox (also called 
varicella) is much like any other illness, and the only long-
lasting effect of the disease may be a few pock scars. But in 

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      335
adults, chickenpox is a serious illness. If your partner gets 
chickenpox when she’s pregnant, it can be transmitted to 
your growing baby. Though rare, the baby’s development 
can be affected, causing limb deformities, mental retarda-
tion, or even miscarriage or stillbirth. If you haven’t had 
chickenpox, consider being vaccinated now.
»
» Listeriosis: Pregnant women are much more vulnerable to 
an infection from bacteria living in certain foods, called 
listeria. The infection, listeriosis, can be caused by eating deli 
meats, soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk, unwashed fruit 
and vegetables, raw meat, pâté, ready-made salads, smoked 
seafood, and smoked shellfish. It’s best to avoid these 
foods while pregnant. Listeriosis can cause miscarriage and 
stillbirth.
»
» Rubella (German measles): If a pregnant woman contracts 
rubella, it can seriously harm the developing baby, including 
severe mental retardation and blindness. Most women 
are vaccinated against rubella as teenagers, but if your 
partner hasn’t been vaccinated and you’re planning to get 
pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about being 
vaccinated now.
Being vaccinated against rubella doesn’t always guarantee a 
lifetime immunity against the virus. Women planning 
pregnancy should have their immunity status checked.
»
» Toxoplasmosis: This is an infection that can be caused by a 
bacteria living in the guts of animals. It can be carried in raw 
meat and in cat poop, so pregnant women should avoid 
dealing with kitty litter boxes and take care when gardening, 
as cats may have used the soil for a toilet. Cook all meat 
thoroughly.
Breastfeeding
Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding in the first months 
of life boosts your baby’s immunity and gives her the very best 
nutrition she needs to grow and thrive. Breastfeeding’s difficult 
in the beginning, and your partner may be pretty exhausted and 
frustrated at times, so give her all the help you can.

336      PART 5  What Happens When
Safely getting through  
pregnancy and delivery
Approximately one percent of babies die between 20 weeks gesta-
tion and up to 28 days after birth. This is referred to as a perinatal 
death. Most of these babies die because they’re born too early and 
their bodies aren’t developed enough for life outside the womb. 
Others die from congenital abnormalities, and in some cases, 
MISCARRIAGE
A miscarriage is the death of a baby before 20 weeks gestation. Many 
women don’t even know they’re pregnant when they miscarry, but 
many others lose much-wanted and cherished babies. In the past, 
people have had the attitude that miscarriages are something to be 
gotten over, that everything will be fixed by trying for another baby. 
Fathers in particular, who can often seem withdrawn or uncaring 
about the loss because men can be more private about the way they 
deal with grief, are encouraged to “just get over it.” But for parents 
who lose babies, it can often be devastating. You also feel you have to 
be strong for your partner, and in a sense you do — you need to 
advocate for your partner at a time when she’s confused, angry, 
­vulnerable, and grieving. But you also need to be empathetic and 
caring, and one way to do that is to talk openly about your feelings 
with your partner. You also need to acknowledge your feelings of loss 
and sadness, rather than pretend to keep a stiff upper lip.
Having a ceremony or funeral for your lost baby may be comforting 
and give you a chance to express your grief and let others support 
you. The ceremony can be anything from a few people lighting a 
candle to a funeral with a minister. Just do what comes naturally to 
you and your partner. Naming your baby can also help you heal — 
acknowledging your baby as a real person, not a “loss” or an “it,” can 
really help.
If you need to talk to someone outside your family and friends, 
­support is available. You just have to ask for it. One site that can offer 
advice and additional support sources is http://miscarriage 
support.com/.

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      337
there is no known reason. Completely normal, healthy pregnan-
cies can end in stillbirths.
Women in the United States are at very low risk of dying during 
pregnancy or childbirth, with approximately 2 in 5,000 pregnant 
women affected. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 
600 women die each year during pregnancy or childbirth. Access 
to good healthcare facilities, skilled maternity healthcare provid-
ers, and plenty of nutritious food for pregnant women and their 
growing babies help keep the numbers low.
To reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy and child-
birth, find a healthcare provider you trust, whether it be an 
obstetrician, general practitioner, or midwife, and attend regular 
checkups with them. Your healthcare provider will monitor for 
conditions such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and other 
factors that may cause complications during pregnancy and child-
birth. If you’re not familiar with these terms, check ­Appendix B 
and read up on them.
Home birth
You may be wondering whether having your baby at home is risk-
ier than having your baby in a hospital. While being nearer to 
medical facilities should something go wrong during your child’s 
birth may help, babies can still die in hospitals with experienced 
healthcare providers, even after mom-to-be took great care of 
her health during pregnancy and excellent healthcare was pro-
vided to her during her pregnancy. We don’t mean to put you off 
or frighten you, but there’s no absolutely certain way to eliminate 
all risks.
Home birth is a contentious issue in the United States. Fewer than 
1 percent of American women deliver at home, according to the 
American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). 
Home birth may pose an increased risk for your newborn, ACOG 
cautions. Talk with your healthcare provider about your birthing 
options.
Women with high-risk pregnancies — who are at risk of pre-
term labor or have preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or any 
other medical complication during pregnancy — are not advised 
to have a planned home birth.

338      PART 5  What Happens When
Cesarean birth
You may think that avoiding a vaginal birth and the stress on 
baby and the mother’s body may be the way to go, but there are 
risks associated with elective caesareans too. After all, a cesarean 
is major surgery, and the mother may experience hemorrhaging 
and infection.
Babies born by cesarean can have breathing difficulties because 
fluid in the lungs is not squeezed out as it is in a vaginal birth. 
Emergency cesareans are performed when the condition of the 
baby or mother is deteriorating, such as cord prolapse, when the 
umbilical cord comes out of the uterus before the baby, blocking 
off his lifeline. In those cases you often don’t have a choice about 
having an emergency cesarean, because the life of the mother or 
child is at risk.
If your partner has had a textbook pregnancy, we suggest not 
worrying about the risks of fatality. Concentrate instead on cre-
ating a peaceful and calm environment for your baby to be born 
into, with lots of support for your partner. Relax and enjoy this 
momentous time in your life.
Reducing the risk of SUDI and SIDS
SUDI stands for Sudden Unexplained Death of Infants. In some 
cases, death is caused by smothering or some other known cause. 
SIDS is a type of SUDI and stands for Sudden Infant Death Syn-
drome, where the baby, for reasons unknown, stops breathing. 
It’s thought that babies who have been around cigarette smoke 
are more at risk. SIDS used to be commonly known as crib death.
There are some simple ways you can reduce your baby’s risk of 
SUDI/SIDS:
»
» Keep your baby’s environment smoke-free. If you both gave 
up smoking when your partner was pregnant, your home 
will be smoke-free.
»
» Put your baby to sleep on her back, not on her side or front. 
The number of SIDS death decreased by 50 percent after the 
American Academy of Pediatrics initiated the Back to Sleep 
campaign.

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      339
»
» Keep your baby’s crib or bassinet free from bumpers, 
blankets, covers, cuddly toys, and sheepskins that could 
smother her.
»
» If you share your bed with your baby (known as co-sleeping), 
do so only when neither you nor your partner has been 
drinking or is excessively tired, to avoid the risk of rolling 
onto your baby. Use a firm mattress and keep all bedding, 
including covers and pillows, far away from your baby. 
Co-sleeping is also safe only if you haven’t been smoking, 
because exposure to smoke puts your baby at risk. A 
bassinet that attaches to the side of your bed is a much safer 
option.
If you’re worried about your baby’s risk of SUDI or SIDS, con-
sider buying an advanced baby monitor that constantly checks 
the baby’s heartbeat and breathing. Check your local baby supply 
store for these monitors.

Calling all dads: Creating a  
healthy and safe home
Keeping up to date with household chores while looking after a 
small child can sometimes seem like taking one step forward, two 
steps back. You wash and clean all the diapers, only to have junior 
need changing twice as often. Or he’s suddenly power-spewing 
all over the place. You may have your hands full just tending to 
baby. But washing your hands after diaper changes, cleaning up 
spit-up, or dealing with laundry is absolutely essential and will 
help cut down the risk of bacterial infection from diapers and 
stomach bugs. You can also

340      PART 5  What Happens When
»
» Have a bottle of hand sterilizer in your diaper bag.
»
» Empty garbage cans with disposable diapers and wipes in 
them regularly — at least once a day.
»
» Wash toys regularly. Most plastic toys can be scrubbed in a 
basin, while soft toys can go in the washing machine.
»
» Air your rooms regularly to reduce the risk of respiratory 
infections caused by damp, dusty houses.
»
» Keep baby’s room at a temperature between 65 and 
70 degrees Fahrenheit, and avoid any drafts.
»
» Avoid tummy bugs by not reheating food for your child that 
has been in the fridge more than 24 hours. Cook fresh food or 
food that has been safely frozen and thawed. If you need to 
keep food in the fridge, make sure it’s covered (for example, 
with cling wrap).
»
» Check the childproofing you’ve made in your house (see 
Chapter 7 for more).
Coping with Illness and Injury
Having a sick or injured baby or child is no fun. As well as feeling 
pretty darn terrible, your child may have trouble understanding 
what’s wrong with him, not be able to communicate well with 
you about what’s wrong, and be scared of the treatments he’s 
receiving.
Spotting injury
When your child is constantly getting bumps and bruises, it can 
be hard to tell when something is going on that can’t just be fixed 
with a bandage and a hug. So how do you figure it out? And what 
do you do if it’s more serious than you first thought?
First of all, stay calm. Reach for the first-aid kit and let us show 
you the way:

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      341
»
» Broken bones: Your child will let you know he’s broken 
something because he’ll be in a lot of pain — much more 
than usual. You may even be able to see how the limb is 
broken. The area may swell or bruise immediately. Keep 
your child as still as possible and support the broken limb. 
Weight on the limb will make it more painful. Get to the 
emergency department of your local hospital as soon as you 
can. If your child can’t move, or you think he shouldn’t be 
moved, such as in the case of a spine or neck fracture, call an 
ambulance.
»
» Burns and scalds: Run cold water on a simple, small burn for 
20 minutes. If your child has scalded himself with hot liquid, 
take his wet clothes off as the heat in the liquid will continue 
to burn his skin. If material is sticking to the skin, don’t try to 
take it off. If the burn is serious and you see redness and 
blistering, get someone to call an ambulance while you take 
care of your child. After you’ve finished pouring cold water 
over the area, cover it with a clean cloth or tea towel and see 
your doctor. Your child will probably be very cold from the 
cold water, so make sure he’s dressed warmly.
»
» Concussion: A bump to the head can result in more than just 
a lump and bruise. Concussion is a temporary loss of brain 
function, from the brain banging against the skull. Your child 
may have hit his head so hard he lost consciousness, or he 
may have a headache, seem disoriented, and vomit repeat-
edly. Being irritable and sensitive to light can also be a sign of 
concussion. Take your child to the hospital immediately.
If you’re in doubt about anything to do with your child’s health, 
it’s better to be safe than sorry, so visit your pediatrician. For any 
of the following injuries, get yourself to the hospital quickly:
»
» Anaphylactic shock from food or a bee sting, where the face 
or mouth swells and your child has trouble breathing.
»
» Bite from a snake, spider, or another animal.
»
» Car accident.
»
» Convulsions, also called seizures, especially those that last 
five minutes or more. Some children under age 5 have 

342      PART 5  What Happens When
febrile seizures whenever they run a fever; if this happens 
regularly, follow your pediatrician’s instructions on whether 
or not your child needs hospital care every time.
»
» Eye injuries.
»
» Electric shocks.
»
» Swallowing of poisons, toxic material, or prescription 
medicines that were not prescribed for your child.
Having emergency phone  
numbers on hand
In the United States, 911 is the emergency number in every state.
The number for Poison Control is 1-800-222-1222.
Putting together a first-aid kit
Keep a well-stocked first-aid kit to deal with injuries. If you don’t 
have a first-aid kit, see Chapter 4, where we give you a run-down 
on first-aid essentials.
If you haven’t done so, consider taking an infant and child first-
aid and CPR course. It can literally save the life of your child or 
the lives of others. If you haven’t done a general CPR course for 
a while, getting a refresher by attending an infant and baby CPR 
course may also be a good idea.
Diagnosing a serious illness
All some children have to deal with healthwise are colds, the odd 
ear infection, or a tummy bug. But some unfortunate children 
have to cope with much worse. As an involved dad you’ll probably 
spot the first signs of a serious illness, because you know your 
child inside out and can tell when something’s not right.
It takes a doctor’s diagnosis to confirm when your child has a 
chronic illness, such as asthma, diabetes, a genetic disorder, or a 
disease such as cancer. Seeing your little child being admitted to 
a hospital is stressful and heartbreaking, but fortunately lots of 
support is available.

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      343
Your child may be very frightened or blame herself for the chaos 
her illness is causing in your lives. Try to be as open and honest 
with her as you can about her health and how you feel, and be 
available to answer any questions she puts to you.
The following organizations can help you in the event of your 
child being diagnosed with a serious illness. Don’t be afraid to ask 
for help if you need it — think of the good it might do your child:

Preparing for the End
To find out that your precious child has a life-limiting illness is 
possibly the toughest thing you may have to go through in your 
life. Anger, confusion, denial, helplessness, despair — you may 
experience every negative emotion you can imagine. Staying 
strong for your child when you feel like falling apart will be hard, 
but with little steps you can do it. Take things one day at a time.
Taking care until the end
Some may think it’s a good idea not to frighten a child with a 
terminal illness with the knowledge that he’s going to die. But 
palliative care professionals — those who care for people at the 
end of their lives — say communicating with your child honestly 
and openly helps allay some of his fears rather than cause them.

344      PART 5  What Happens When
Your child may be very confused about what’s going on, and talk-
ing honestly and planning for the future can help put his mind at 
rest. He may be concerned about why you and your partner are so 
sad, may blame himself for your sadness, or may be worried about 
his pets or schoolwork. Reassure him that it’s not his fault that 
you’re upset and be open to answering any questions he may have.
Talk to your healthcare team about palliative care options for your 
child. Care can be provided at home, with or without the help of 
hospice, or in the hospital. These health professionals can help 
you talk to your child about what he’s facing in an age-appropriate 
manner.
These ideas may also help you get through this seemingly impos-
sible time:
»
» Enlist the support of family and friends to help with tasks like 
laundry, food preparation, feeding pets, and so on. They can 
also babysit your other children, if you have them, when you 
need to be at the hospital or hospice.
»
» Look after yourself, rest, and eat well when you can.
»
» Talk to counselors or chaplains at your hospital. Your care 
team can put you in touch with them. Involve your partner 
and other children if you like.
»
» Find out if there are any special activities your child would 
like to do. Perhaps you can take a trip to the beach together 
as a family, or visit a special place together.
»
» Write in a journal, take photographs, and revisit old photo-
graphs with your child. Make memories.
»
» Cry, shout, stamp your feet. It’s okay to be angry, to need 
time to yourself, and to grieve.
»
» Don’t let anyone hurry you into making any decisions about 
anything. Take your time and do things at your own pace.
Where to care for your little one
Palliative care is specialized care for people who have a termi-
nal or life-limiting illness. Palliative care professionals take into 

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      345
account not only the stages that the body goes through as it shuts 
down, but also how the patient and her family are coping and 
dealing with this most traumatic event. For adults, most palliative 
care takes place in a hospital or hospice, which is a special facility 
for palliative care.
Of course, you can also consider caring for your child at home, 
with assistance from palliative care workers, depending on the 
type of illness or injury your child has and which services are 
available to you.
You may be overwhelmed by having to make a decision about 
where your child will spend her last days. Take your time. Talk it 
through with your partner. Don’t hurry into a decision.
Letting family and friends know
Dealing with the devastating news that your child has a life-
limiting illness is hard enough without having to tell friends and 
family. Ultimately this is something only you’ll know how to do 
and when the time is right to tell others.
After you have told them, people will usually be only too happy to 
help out with any errands that need to be done, cooking, laundry, 
and the like, which may be in the too-hard basket for you right now.
If it’s just too hard to tell people, perhaps you could tell someone 
in your immediate family who can do this for you. Don’t force 
yourself to do anything you don’t want to do right now. Just 
­getting through each moment is challenging enough.
You may have to break the news to your other children or nieces 
and nephews, and here we give you some pointers:
»
» Be honest. Tell your children only what you believe to be true.
»
» Be somewhere safe, with the cellphone off and the phone 
off the hook, and with the children’s full attention.
»
» Anticipate that there will be tough questions to answer, but 
answer them as honestly as you can. Trying to soften the 
blow may mean your children are upset even more when 
things get messy.

346      PART 5  What Happens When
»
» Give small pieces of information that the children can chew 
on. They don’t need to know all the ins and outs of cancer 
treatment or anything too detailed.
»
» It may take a while for the information to get through. Give 
the children time to digest what they’ve heard, and be 
available to answer any other questions they may have in 
the coming days and weeks.
»
» Give lots of hugs, and let your children know it’s okay to be 
upset.
»
» Reassure your children that it’s not their fault that this is 
happening to their sibling or cousin.
Seeking help
You’ll have a lot of questions and be feeling all over the place. 
Knowing there’s someone there who can guide you and your part-
ner through your grief helps. While everyone grieves in a different 
way, it can help to talk it through with people who can share their 
knowledge and help you on your journey.

CHAPTER 17  Serious Illness and Losing Your Baby      347
Dealing with the Unthinkable
When a child dies, we lose more than a person we loved — we lose 
the promise that person brought with him. It can threaten our 
identity as fathers. We blame ourselves, because as fathers we’re 
supposed to protect our children and look after them, ensuring 
they’re well. The death of a child cannot be approached rationally. 
You can only acknowledge your feelings and thoughts, many of 
which may not make any sense.
What to do, what not to do
Men grieve differently from women, so while our partners may 
find it easy to go to friends or family for support, it may not be 
so easy for you (or vice versa). It may take a little longer for some 
dads to really process feelings. Some may not know how life is 
supposed to carry on without their child. Here are some sugges-
tions for getting through this difficult time:
»
» Talk to your partner — even if it’s just to say you don’t want 
to talk. Let her know you need some space, or a hug, or to 
just sit together.
»
» Being physical can help. Go for a long walk, ride a bike, or 
play some sport. Being outdoors close to nature can be 
restorative and help you process your feelings too.
»
» Try not to let yourself become isolated. Sure, you want 
space, but shutting everyone out is not going to help you in 
the long run. Let people know you need space for a bit.
»
» Keeping busy really works for some guys who are grieving. 
Creating a memorial or starting a project can distract you 
from the all-encompassing nature of grief.
»
» Try to look after yourself. Eat, sleep, and shower. Though 
they may make you feel good in the short term, avoid drugs 
and alcohol.

348      PART 5  What Happens When
Saying goodbye
Take time with your baby to say goodbye, to hold him, and to let 
other members of your family see and hold him too. You can ask 
your funeral director to arrange to have photographs of your baby 
taken by a tasteful, sensitive photographer. You’ll probably feel a 
bit hesitant about this, but it can be a healing experience for you 
to look back and remember holding your child.
There’s a good reason most cultures have a funeral tradition — 
the ritual of saying goodbye to a loved one who has died is a very 
powerful and healing process. Funerals encourage us to confront 
our grief and to express how we feel about our loved one. A funeral 
also marks that child’s place among her family.
When a baby is stillborn (dies in utero after 20 weeks gestation) or 
dies shortly after birth, states require that the baby be buried in 
a cemetery or cremated. For your baby’s funeral, consider music 
to be played, songs, readings, and poems to be read. You can have 
your baby’s funeral at home and can transport your baby from the 
hospital or home to the cemetery.
There’s no hurry to do anything. Don’t feel forced into doing any-
thing you don’t want to do. Take your time and decide when you 
feel you’re ready.
Is there such a thing 
as “moving on”?
Each parent and person grieves differently for the child they’ve 
lost. The term “moving on” implies that the intensity of feeling 
you had for the child you’ve lost fades and the significance of that 
child also fades. Organizations helping parents grieve report that 
no parent ever forgets the loss of a child.
Some parents report that they haven’t moved on, but the way 
they feel is different. The child they’ve lost, whether he was at 
12 weeks of gestation, stillborn, or a teenager when he died, is still 
a big part of his parents’ lives and a part of their family, and they 
celebrate the impact he had on their hearts.

E
very father wants his child to be happy and healthy. Fathers 
want their children to experience everything, to have every 
opportunity, and to be able to do anything they want to do. 
But for some children, that world of possibilities is limited by 
­illness, injury, or an inherited disorder or condition.
Although medical science and technology can help improve the 
mobility, hearing, and sight of a disabled child and our more 
enlightened society can give children with disabilities the same 
rights and advantages that nondisabled children have, it’s still a 
hard road for many dads.

350      PART 5  What Happens When
But where to start? How do you discover your child has a dis-
ability? Once you have a diagnosis, what do you do then? In this 
chapter, we offer some suggestions along the way — with tips 
for finding help and knowing your speech pathologist from your 
occupational therapist — and give you a heads-up on how having 
a child with a disability may change your lifestyle.
What Is a Disability, Anyway?
A disability is a condition, disorder, or disease that disables the 
person from taking part in one or more life activities. The dis-
ability stops the person from doing what other people can do, 
whether it be walking, listening, grasping ideas, or talking. Dis-
abilities can be physical or mental. Children with disabilities are 
sometimes called special needs children.
Knowing when something 
is wrong with your baby
Some children are born with a noticeable disability. Congenital 
abnormalities (also known as birth defects) or genetic disorders 
that manifest themselves physically, such as Down Syndrome, are 
pretty obvious when the child is born. These problems may have 
been discovered during the pregnancy.
But other disabilities aren’t so obvious, and it may be a while 
before they make themselves known. Disabilities such as visual 
and hearing impairment, learning disabilities, and autism aren’t 
apparent for months, sometimes years.
Sometimes you can just tell when something’s not right. Perhaps 
your baby doesn’t recognize toys or shapes, or perhaps he doesn’t 
seem to hear or respond to your voice the way other babies respond 
to their dads. Perhaps he doesn’t try to crawl or move when other 
kids his age are already running. Or perhaps it’s just a feeling you 
get, your intuition telling you things aren’t quite right.
Your first port of call should be your pediatrician. If necessary, 
get a referral to a specialist or psychologist to pinpoint what the 

CHAPTER 18  Disabilities, Disorders, and Special Conditions      351
problem may be. If your doctor tries to placate you with an “I 
think he looks fine” and you’re sure he’s not, stand your ground. 
Your child isn’t able to stick up for himself the way you are. Your 
job is to advocate for your child and get him the help you feel he 
needs. If you don’t trust and have confidence in your pediatrician 
to take your concerns seriously, try another doctor until you find 
one you feel comfortable with.
It may pay to track your child’s progress before going to see your 
healthcare provider, so you have something concrete to show him 
when you have your appointment. Keep doing this until you’ve 
spoken to a specialist and have decided on a course of action or 
had a diagnosis made.
Waiting for a diagnosis can be a long and incredibly stressful pro-
cess, but try to stay positive for your little one. Don’t blame your-
self or your partner for any perceived problems — neither of you 
is at fault.
After a diagnosis is made, you and your specialist can decide on a 
course of action and get your child started on medication or treat-
ment if required.
Physical disabilities
A physical disability is a permanent disability that restricts body 
movement or mobility in some way. Some physical disabilities 
are caused by genetic disorders, a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect that has developed while growing in the womb, an ill-
ness such as meningitis, or as the result of an injury to the spine, 
brain, or limbs.
The main forms of physical disability include
»
» Brain and spinal injuries: These injuries are mainly caused 
by an accident that breaks or damages the spinal cord or 
causes damage to the brain. Brain and spinal injuries can 
cause paralysis or mental impairment.
»
» Cerebral palsy: This is a condition where parts of the brain 
are damaged either during pregnancy, during birth, or as the 
result of a lack of oxygen.

352      PART 5  What Happens When
»
» Disabilities of the senses: Children can be born with visual 
or hearing impairments because of a congenital abnormality 
or a genetic disorder. These senses can also be affected by 
disease after birth.
»
» Muscular dystrophy: This is a genetic disorder in which 
muscle strength and function deteriorate over time. Most 
commonly seen in babies and young boys, some forms 
aren’t diagnosed until early adulthood. Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy is the most common form, and it affects mainly 
boys (Duchenne muscular dystrophy is rare in girls). About 
one-third of those affected also have some sort of learning 
difficulty. Not only are muscles in the limbs affected, but also 
heart muscles, which eventually affects life expectancy.
»
» Spina bifida: A congenital abnormality, which means it 
happens while the baby is growing in the womb, spina bifida 
literally means “split spine” and happens in the early weeks 
of pregnancy. As the spine develops, vertebrae grow and 
close around the spinal cord, protecting it. In the case of 
spina bifida, the vertebrae don’t close completely, and in 
some types of spina bifida, the spinal cord and meninges (a 
system of membranes that envelop the central nervous 
system) protrude from the back. As a result, the spinal cord 
can be damaged and messages sent to and from the brain 
get confused. Paralysis, incontinence, loss of sensation, and 
a build-up of fluid on the brain called hydrocephalus can 
occur.

CHAPTER 18  Disabilities, Disorders, and Special Conditions      353
Intellectual disabilities
Just as congenital abnormalities and genetic disorders can affect a 
child’s body, so they can also affect a child’s intellectual abilities — 
the ability to think, reason, communicate, control emotions, and 
grasp ideas. Increasingly, people with intellectual disabilities are 
being integrated into mainstream society, where they’re appre-
ciated for their individual attributes rather than judged by their 
disability.
Some intellectual disabilities can be diagnosed at birth or even 
before. Others aren’t obvious until your child is a few years old 
or at school.
Some of the most common syndromes and disorders that can 
cause intellectual disability include the following:
»
» Autism: Autism is also known as autism spectrum disorder 
because the range of severity differs from person to person. 
A person with autism may have trouble making sense of the 
world and find it difficult to communicate, cope in social 
situations, or control his emotions. Autism affects as many 
as one in 45 children in the United States, with boys affected 
over four times more frequently than girls. The causes of 
autism are unknown.
»
» Down Syndrome: Down Syndrome is caused by an extra bit 
of chromosome being replicated in cell division very early on 
after the mother’s ovum has been fertilized, meaning that a 
child with Down Syndrome has an extra chromosome in his 
body. Children with Down Syndrome have varying degrees 
of mental and sometimes physical disability.
Intellectual disability can also be caused by drinking, drug abuse, 
or illness during pregnancy; an infection like meningitis; head 
injuries; or a lack of oxygen during birth or during an accident, 
like a near-drowning. There are also other rare genetic conditions, 
such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, that cause intellectual disability.
With a very small child, doctors and health professionals often 
use the term developmental delay rather than labeling the child as 
intellectually disabled.

» National Down Syndrome Society: www.ndss.org/
Multiple disabilities
Most disorders, illnesses, or injuries are rarely limited to only one 
part of the body, so in most cases a child with a particular prob-
lem has more than one disability. For example, Down Syndrome 
affects cognitive abilities as well as physical growth. Children 
with Down Syndrome also have a higher risk of having congenital 
heart defects, recurrent ear infections, and thyroid dysfunctions 
as well as other conditions.
Getting formal confirmation
In some cases, the specialist you’ve been referred to will be able 
to tell you whether your child has a specific disability or a range 
of disabilities and may be able to tell you how the disabilities were 
caused.
In other cases, a diagnosis isn’t clear, and your child may con-
tinue to undergo tests, which can be a fairly traumatic time.
After you have confirmation about a disability, it’s time to put a 
plan in place to manage the condition through medication, physi-
cal treatment, or getting any equipment you may need, such as 
a wheelchair. In some situations you’ll be given a caseworker to 
help you.
Support groups and organizations for almost every condition, ill-
ness, and disability that exists are available. Contact the organiza-
tions listed in this chapter or consult your specialist or healthcare 
provider. Having support from people who’ve been through what 
you’re going through now, who may be able to share information 

CHAPTER 18  Disabilities, Disorders, and Special Conditions      355
and strategies or help you get access to specialist services, is 
invaluable. Sometimes even just knowing that you are not alone 
with a condition and discussing what it was like for other parents 
can be a huge help.
What comes next?
You’re in for yet another journey as part of your fatherhood expe-
rience. Treatment, therapy, and learning about the fathering your 
special needs child will probably require takes some extra effort. 
This is also a huge opportunity for your own personal growth and 
development to become an amazing father.
We’ve come across a number of inspiring stories from fathers 
with disabled children. They generally all say that looking after a 
disabled baby and child in many ways is no different from look-
ing after a nondisabled child. Babies and children with disabili-
ties all cry, laugh, eat, soil their diapers, and want to be loved. 
When dealing with the limiting factors of their child’s condition, 
these dads have often challenged doctors or therapists about their 
expectations of what children with a particular disability may or 
may not be able to do. Often parents have managed to achieve 
amazing results with their children by finding alternative ways 
around barriers, allowing their children to participate in what life 
has to offer just like any other child would.
Here are some general tips on living with a child with a disability 
for both you and your family:
»
» Work with your child’s strengths and likes. What does your 
child like doing? You can incorporate dancing, art, and foot 
and water play into your child’s therapy or treatment plan. 
Does she like to be hands-on? Or does your child need a 
strict routine to give her security? Being aware of the way 
your child learns best and the routines she needs is a key 
dad-skill to develop.
»
» Involve your child whenever you can with simple tasks like 
food preparation, vacuuming, or making the bed. Break 
instructions down into simple, bite-sized pieces and give 
heaps of praise for her efforts.

356      PART 5  What Happens When
»
» Get support. There are a lot of support organizations out 
there that can put you in touch with other fathers and guide 
you to find funding, treatments, and even respite care.
»
» Give lots of praise for your child when she accomplishes a 
new skill or takes on a new challenge.
»
» Focus on the things your child can do rather than what she 
can’t.
»
» Learn as much as you can about your child’s disability. 
Knowledge is power.
»
» Have realistic expectations about your child’s development, 
but challenge any preconceived limitations people place on 
your child about what she can and can’t do. Perhaps there’s 
a way she can accomplish a task — after all, you know your 
child best.
Being on a New Journey When 
Your Child Is Disabled
You’ve had confirmation that your child is disabled. This can bring 
out all sorts of frustrations and disappointments, and you may 
keep these emotions pretty tightly under wraps for the moment. 
That’s fine, but it may also feel good to let it all out with someone 
who has been in a similar situation.
Imagining the hard road ahead of you can be devastating, and you 
may even blame yourself for whatever the problem is. But another 
way to look at your child’s disability is as a way to motivate your-
self to help your child develop to her full potential.
Adjusting your expectations
When you first find out you’re going to be a father, thinking of 
your child as a way to fix all the things that went wrong in your 
own life, or wanting your child to have more opportunities or 
career options than you did, is tempting. Perhaps you imagined 

CHAPTER 18  Disabilities, Disorders, and Special Conditions      357
your child becoming an astronaut, a concert pianist, or anything 
that she may dream of being.
So it takes a bit of getting used to the idea that your blind child will 
never see the world, your face, or his own children (unless there 
are amazing leaps forward in technology). But then again, would 
Stevie Wonder have become the amazing artist he is if he weren’t 
blind? You never know what’s in store for your offspring, which 
is really no different from the experience all other parents have.
DISABLED IN ONE WAY —  
VERY ABLE IN OTHERS
Disabled is a misleading term. For one thing, it defines a person by 
what he’s not able to do.
What do we most remember about Beethoven, Louis Braille, or 
Stephen Hawking? They’ve all achieved incredible things, far beyond 
what many able-bodied folk have done!
•	 The great composer Beethoven gradually went deaf, but was still 
able to create incredible music without any sense of hearing.
•	 Louis Braille was blinded by an accident as a young child and went 
on to create a way for the blind to read with their fingers.
•	 Stephen Hawking has a form of motor neuron disease called 
­amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and was given only a few years to  
live when his condition was diagnosed in his early twenties (he’s 
now in his seventies). Hawking is wheelchair bound and needs  
a ­computer to communicate. Despite these limitations, he has 
­produced groundbreaking work in the field of theoretical physics. 
Hawking writes about his experience of disability on his website at 
www.hawking.org.uk.
Other famous people who have shown disability is no barrier to suc-
cess include actress Marlee Matlin, who went deaf from a childhood 
illness; Helen Keller, who proved being deaf, blind, and mute couldn’t 
stop her from getting a university degree; and Franklin Roosevelt, who 
became president of the United States despite the fact that his legs 
were paralyzed from polio.

358      PART 5  What Happens When
Going into fatherhood, we also expect that our children will grow 
up and one day leave home. It may not be possible for children 
with a severe intellectual disability who need one-on-one care 
24 hours a day to live an independent life. This can take quite a 
while to sink in, so cut yourself some slack and allow emotions 
and frustration to come and go.
But there are incredible things to be said for accomplishing things 
that are relevant to your child’s world. The triumph of an autistic 
child — who, with time, patience, and the right support, is able 
to communicate her needs and ideas to a range of people — feels 
like a huge achievement, on par with any other milestone parents 
see their children accomplish.
And who’s to say that your child won’t be able to do what most 
experts think he can’t do? You may find that your little one com-
pletely shatters your ideas of what it means to have a disability 
and achieves much more than you ever imagined.
Finding help, assistance,  
and ­resources
Knowing where to go to find assistance — both monetary and 
emotional — is a minefield. Start with your caseworker, your 
healthcare provider, and the support organizations listed ear-
lier in this chapter, and check out the following resources for 
­information about funding, schooling, and your child’s rights. 
Local and state organizations can also point you in the right 
direction. Most parents of special needs kids become very savvy 
about getting the help their child requires:

Access for People  
with Disabilities
After you know what you’re dealing with, it’s time to get into 
solution mode — something dads are great at! You can shine as 
your disabled child’s dad in numerous ways, such as by making 
a little ramp for the wheelchair or coming up with a computer 
program that assists your child’s communication. No doubt you 
have many skills you can readily use to create a better experience 
for your child.
Your special baby
You’re bringing your baby home from the hospital for the first 
time. It should be a time of great excitement, but you’re probably 
overwhelmed with the challenges of not only looking after a new, 
small human being, but a new, small human being with special 
needs. These tips may help you get through this time:
»
» While you may still experience an emotional roller coaster, 
try not to forget that you have a small child who needs all the 
love and nurturing you can give him as he becomes aware of 
his world. As for any newborn child, this time is fleeting, so 
take some time to admire those little fingers and those 
chubby little legs, and enjoy the new addition to your lives.
»
» Get family or close friends to support you by perhaps 
fending off unwanted visitors, organizing appointments with 
health workers, or just doing your laundry. Let someone look 
after you for a while, just as you need to look after your baby.
»
» Ask for help if you need it. There’s no point in struggling on 
bravely because you can’t ask for a hand. Plenty of people 
are around to help you.
»
» Keep records of health visits and your baby’s daily progress, 
or any notes you need, in one central place so you can grab 
them the next time you need to talk to your healthcare 
workers. Because so much paperwork is associated with the 
care of a disabled child, staying organized is essential.

360      PART 5  What Happens When
Working with health professionals
Some of the health professionals you may meet when caring for 
your special needs child include
»
» An audiologist, who assesses your child’s hearing and can 
recommend treatment or hearing aids.
»
» A dietitian, who can be very helpful if your child’s illness 
involves following a certain diet or certain dietary restrictions 
are tried.
»
» An occupational therapist, or OT, who assesses how well your 
child is able to perform day-to-day tasks, like dressing or 
brushing his teeth. She may also assess how you’ll manage 
getting from place to place if transport is a bit more compli-
cated with your little one. The aim of an OT is to help your 
child become involved in all aspects of day-to-day life, and 
increase his independence and well-being.
»
» A physical therapist, who will work on your child’s physical 
delays.
»
» A psychologist, who assesses your child’s mental health and 
cognitive skills. Psychologists may help with strategies for 
managing emotional and behavioral problems.
»
» Speech therapists and speech pathologists, who assess how 
well your child can communicate with others and either 
figure out ways to improve his speech or find alternative 
ways of communicating, such as electronic devices or sign 
language.
Living with a disability
It doesn’t matter what condition, illness, injury, or syndrome 
your child has; finding out that your child is not the child you had 
hoped he would be can be devastating. On top of managing your 
own feelings and frustration, you may also be sensitive to other 
people’s reactions when they see your child. As with all feelings, 
give yourself time to work through them (rather than ignore or 
suppress them) and seek help if you need to. Most importantly, 

CHAPTER 18  Disabilities, Disorders, and Special Conditions      361
keep communicating with your partner, who’s likely to be feeling 
the same thing.
Be aware of what triggers negative feelings, such as going to doc-
tors’ appointments or seeing friends’ children. Then you can pre-
pare yourself and work out strategies for coping with any negative 
emotions.
Living with a disabled child is often a bit more involved than liv-
ing with an able-bodied child, but there are things you can do to 
make it easier:
»
» Do your own research. Knowledge is power. These days, 
practically everyone has access to an amazing information 
resource — the Internet. Find out whether there are any 
devices, techniques, or therapies that could help your child 
(or you) become more independent or make life easier.
»
» Set small, achievable goals for your child, as you would for 
any child. Pushing him too hard will only leave both of you 
frustrated.
»
» If your child is going to day care or school, talk to teachers 
and administrative staff well in advance so they can build 
ramps, obtain resources, and apply for any special teacher 
aide staff that may be required. Find out what rights your 
child has in regards to education in your state.
»
» Keep in touch with teaching staff about your child’s progress. 
This helps you, your child, and the teachers, who can 
personalize a program for your child.
Changing your lifestyle
Having a child with a disability will probably mean you have to 
adjust your lifestyle to suit his needs:
»
» Depending on the level of care your child needs, you or your 
partner may have to give up working outside the home.
»
» If your child uses a wheelchair, you’ll need to renovate your 
home to make doors wide enough to get the wheelchair 

362      PART 5  What Happens When
through, install ramps rather than steps, and fit equipment 
for lifting the chair in and out of vehicles.
»
» With one less income and more expenses, your family may 
be under extra financial pressure, so seek out any subsidies 
or allowances you can from government agencies. See the 
section “Finding help, assistance, and resources” earlier in 
this chapter for links.
»
» You may need to go to more doctors’ appointments and 
make more trips to the hospital. If you live far from a 
hospital, it may mean you need to move to be closer to 
medical facilities.
»
» Some children need 24-hour, seven-days-a-week care, which 
is hard work. You may need a dedicated healthcare provider 
or full-time nursing assistance to organize care in your 
home. In many cases, insurance covers this cost.
If your child is disabled and needs a lot of care, you must take 
some time to take care of yourself and your partner. Talk to your 
health workers about respite care or get support from family and 
friends so you have a little time off every now and then.
Sharing the love
If there’s one word we’ve used over and over again in this book, 
it’s support. Nothing beats having people to help share not only 
your problems, but also the love. When your child is disabled, 
small victories are to be had along the way. With other parents 
in similar situations, you have a whole lot more people to share 
those successes with.

Separation 
and Divorce
H
aving a relationship these days is hard. You’re expected to 
be all things to all people — your partners, families, 
friends, employers, and children. This puts a lot of strain 
on you and your relationships. As a result some marriages and 
relationships don’t survive the stresses of parenting, financial 
worry, the frenetic pace of life, and the need for your own space.
A relationship failure is devastating, even more so when children 
are involved. As a father in this situation, life can feel pretty rough 
and frustrating. But being a great father doesn’t end with your 
relationship.
You’re the adult here, the dad, and where you have control and 
the power to make decisions for your family, your children don’t. 
They may be confused, blaming themselves and frightened about 
what the future brings for them. They may be hoping you and 

364      PART 5  What Happens When
their mother can patch things up. It’s important to tread care-
fully, for their sakes.
In this chapter, we offer some ways to help save an ailing mar-
riage or relationship and avoid the devastation a breakup causes. 
But if your relationship’s beyond help and it’s time to call it a 
day, we guide you through the separation and divorce process in 
terms of how it impacts you as a dad. And we give you some advice 
on surviving your new life as a single dad, whether you’re the 
­primary caregiver or not.
Taking Action if Your Marriage 
Is on the Rocks
Every relationship goes through difficult times, but knowing what 
you can do about it can mean the difference between calling it 
quits or building a better relationship than you and your partner 
had before.
What you can do
If your marriage or relationship is going through a rough patch, 
you need to take a close look at yourself and your part in the dif-
ficulties the two of you are experiencing. It’s true that it takes two 
to tango and two to make a relationship work, but here we need 
to focus on the part you as an individual play in it. You need to be 
able to take full responsibility for your actions in the relationship. 
Ultimately you have full control only over your own actions. You 
can’t make someone else do what you want. So to avoid further 
frustration, start looking at the man in the mirror to see what he 
can change before pointing the finger at your partner.
To be able to look at your role in the relationship objectively, let 
go of negative emotions like anger and blame. Being righteously 
indignant or holding on to the feeling that you’ve been wronged 
doesn’t help you fix whatever the problem is. If you’re feeling guilty 
or ashamed, try to let it go. Clear your head, and sit down and make 
a list of what you really want from your relationship. It can help to 

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      365
put some thought into what your partner wants from the relation-
ship and whether you’re able to provide that for her. ­Ideally, ask 
your partner if she wants to do the same exercise as well.
Look at what you’ve written and keep it in mind as an inspira-
tional goal for your relationship. When you’re clear about what 
you want, discuss your list (and her list) with your partner. 
Remember that you and your partner are on the same side of the 
mediation table and the “problem” in your relationship is on the 
other side. The process of getting your relationship back on track 
is much more productive if you work together rather than get 
wound up in a blame game.
Asking others for some feedback may also help. This can be pretty 
tough, but a close friend will tell you straight up how he sees things. 
Keeping a clear head and seeing things objectively when your rela-
tionship is in a tailspin can be tricky. A third-party perspective may 
give you a more unbiased view of yourself and your relationship.
Repairing a marriage takes time. Try to be patient and realize things 
aren’t going to magically happen overnight. Be conscious of, and 
patient about, how things are changing as a result of your efforts.
You’re an adult and a dad who is in the process of bringing up a 
child or children to be responsible, able to deal with their emo-
tions, and have self-control. It therefore makes sense to demon-
strate those qualities in yourself and not fight or bad-mouth your 
partner in front of your children. It places a lot of stress on a child 
and forces her to take sides, which clearly isn’t fair. If you need 
to let off some steam, find a place where you can be alone and do 
whatever helps you release some tension (in a safe way). Ideally, 
do something that’s physically exhausting.
What you can both do
You can only change yourself — but if you get your partner work-
ing with you, the two of you can agree on ways to rebuild your 
relationship. Both of you have to be willing and able to make 
changes. Here are some ideas:
»
» Talk openly about what is and isn’t working in your relation-
ship. Rather than blaming the other person for what’s wrong, 

366      PART 5  What Happens When
try to explain things in terms of how you feel or think. If talking 
between yourselves about the relationship gets you nowhere, 
consider involving a relationship coach or counselor.
»
» As a couple, come up with a strategy for making things 
better. Write down your strategy. Assess how well you’re 
sticking to it and figure out whether you need to make some 
adjustments.
»
» Make it a rule to say three to five positive things for each 
negative thing you say about each other.
»
» Eat together at night, so you have a chance to talk about 
your day and catch up a little bit. Maybe go out for lunch or 
dinner every now and then.
»
» Listen without interrupting your partner, even if you strongly 
disagree with what she’s saying. Ask your partner to do the 
same when you’ve got something you want to express.
»
» If financial stress is an issue, sit down with a calculator and 
work on remedying your financial problems once and for all. 
Money is one of the biggest stresses a relationship faces. If 
you feel lost, get a money coach or financial adviser.
»
» Don’t get complacent. Your relationship isn’t going to fix itself 
without a little work from both of you. You both need to 
work on your relationship and keep at it.
You can find relationship counselors through these sources:
»
» Licensed therapists in private practice (some may be 
certified through the American Association for Marriage and 
Family Therapy)
»
» Therapists who work through state or county mental health 
organizations
»
» A pastor or other spiritual adviser
Where to go if all fails
Sometimes, despite all the efforts you’ve made to hold onto your 
relationship, it still fails.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      367
The best-case scenario when a relationship comes to an end is 
that your relationship is amicable and you’re both a daily feature 
of your children’s lives, with that same loving bond with them.
However, if the relationship has ended badly, or you’ve been 
kicked out or had to leave the family home, it can be very easy to 
slide into despair. Sure, you’re not going to be the life of the party 
right now, and feeling rotten is normal, but if you have trouble 
getting out of that dark place and feel hopeless, you need to get 
help climbing back out. Feeling depressed and frustrated only 
holds you back from moving on and being a great dad. Your kids 
will be feeling confused and anxious, and if they’re still young, 
they may be blaming themselves for what has happened. They 
need you right now, and your job is to be there for them.
Your role as a lover and partner is over, and it may hurt and be 
embarrassing, but you’re still the father of your children, and this 
will always be the case. Your fatherhood journey doesn’t end here, 
although you may have to take a different route.
These are some places you can look to for support and advice 
when your relationship has gone south:
»
» Counselor: Get help dealing with the grief and emotions you 
have about the end of your relationship or marriage.
»
» Lawyer or legal aid: Find out where you stand legally with 
regard to seeing your children, and what rights and obliga-
tions you have.
»
» Mediator: Talk to someone who can assist with family group 
counseling sessions.
Splitting Up
Your relationship, sad as it is, is beyond help. You and your part-
ner can’t see a way to stay together and have decided to split up. 
Whether it’s amicable or not, the end of a relationship means the 
start of a whole new world for you, your former partner, and your 
children.

368      PART 5  What Happens When
Waiting for the dust to settle
You may find your relationship has taken a turn for the worse and 
you’re out the door with next to nothing. Or, as many men expe-
rience, you end up haggling over shared assets, personal posses-
sions, and of course, the tricky question of how best to manage 
your children’s care.
Sorting out child-care arrangements and the distribution of 
assets is best done when the dust has settled a bit — not in the 
heat of the moment — and you and your estranged partner are 
able to talk without antagonizing each other or ending the discus-
sion in tears.
Understanding the  
divorce process
When you are separated, you may be thinking about getting 
divorced or dissolving your civil union, which puts a permanent 
end to your legal relationship. Every state sets its own rules for 
how divorce is handled. There are residency requirements, and 
different courts handle divorce in each state. To make things even 
more complicated, child custody may be handled in a different 
court than divorce. Finding a lawyer well versed in divorce pro-
ceedings in your state should be your first step.
If you have friends or family members who have gone through 
a divorce, ask them whether they found their lawyer helpful, 
but keep in mind that the lawyer your friend loved may not be 
right for you. Personality is important, because you’ll be working 
closely together. Cost and the lawyer’s proximity can also play a 
part in finding the right person. Some lawyers offer one free con-
sultation, which can help you find the right person.
If you have friends who are lawyers, they can give you the low-
down on other lawyers who practice in your area.
The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers maintains a list 
of lawyers who specialize in this area; check its website at www.
aaml.org. Some states offer certification in family law, which 
requires additional continuing education in this field.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      369
Making separation easier  
on your children
A separation can be quite tough as you struggle with all your feel-
ings about the relationship ending, but your kids also need you. 
Try to offer them support and continue to nurture that loving 
relationship you’ve worked so hard at all this time.
Children react to separation and divorce in different ways. Some 
act out and go “off the rails.” Others are clingy and need reas-
surance that you’re not abandoning them. Some children blame 
themselves for what’s happening. Others hide how they really feel 
and appear to be coping well.
However your child reacts to the news that you and your partner 
aren’t together any more, these tips will help get them through 
this traumatic time:
»
» Fighting in front of your children is not okay. Fighting in 
front of your kids is stressful for them, puts them in the 
middle of your fight, and can dent their trust in you. Leave 
your kids out of any conflict you have with their mom — 
don’t ask them which parent they’d like to live with, don’t ask 
them to lock her out, and don’t ask them for information 
about what she’s doing.
»
» Don’t lie to your children. When you tell your children 
about what’s going on, use neutral language rather than 
blaming their mom or getting angry. Take the emotion out 
of what you’re saying. Be honest and genuine with your 
children.
»
» Let your children know that you’re there for them. You 
may be living away from home right now, but make it clear 
you’re always able to talk to them. Be open and honest with 
any questions they may have and remember to take the 
emotion — anger, frustration, animosity — out of what 
you’re saying, so you leave your children out of the conflict 
you’re experiencing.

370      PART 5  What Happens When
Counseling and therapy aren’t just for adults going through a 
difficult time. Children may also benefit from talking to a child 
therapist, who can help them work through the process. Look for 
therapists who specialize in treating children and whose treat-
ment will involve play therapy and other ways to express feelings 
they may not be able to verbalize.
While the Internet is a good place to start your search for a child 
therapist, ask friends, family, and your child’s healthcare pro-
vider for recommendations as well. Psychiatrists, psychologists, 
social workers, and family counselors can all specialize as child 
therapists, and one isn’t necessarily better than the other. As with 
divorce lawyers, personality, proximity, and cost will play a part 
in your choice, but the therapist you choose should be certified or 
licensed in this area.
You’re not just another statistic
Marriage breakdown is, sadly, extremely common. Around 
50 percent of all marriages in the United States end in divorce.
With these high rates of divorce, you’re clearly on a well-trodden 
path, but that doesn’t mean it hurts any less or that your kids 
aren’t going to be hurt by it too. It may even help you to know 
that many people are going about their ordinary day having got-
ten over a divorce and having found great solutions to what was 
once a very messy situation for them.
On the other hand, even though separation and divorce aren’t 
uncommon, every relationship breakdown, just like every rela-
tionship itself, is unique. The way you cope with, and help your 
kids cope with, this tricky time in your lives is unique to your 
family.
You may be able to find a support group near you. However, it’s 
important that the group is a positive influence and not just a 
group of bitter, angry people interested only in bashing their ex. 
As tempting as it may be to rant and see yourself as a victim, it 
generally does nothing toward being a successful role model for 
your children. Separation and divorce are yet another opportunity 
for you to be the bigger man and for your own personal growth.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      371
Finding good support
It’s essential that you find someone to support you through this 
time — a kind of “breakup buddy.” You’re probably getting all 
sorts of advice from all sorts of people, but they don’t necessarily 
know what’s best for you or your kids. You need someone who
»
» Can be honest with you, perhaps even a bit blunt at times
»
» Is 100 percent there for you when you need it
»
» Isn’t vindictive toward your ex
»
» Knows how important it is for you to remain a strong role 
model and loving father to your children
You can also turn to a counselor, a men’s group, or a group for 
divorced and separated men and women for advice and support. 
If you can’t find a group in your area, try joining an online group. 
(Some groups, such as Divorce Care [www.divorcecare.org], may 
have a religious bent.)
Avoid any group or professional who makes you feel like you’re 
not being heard. Try to avoid groups that foster negative action 
toward any or particular organization, such as the family court.
When you find great support, hang onto it. The process of sepa-
ration and divorce can take several years or more to get through, 
and you’ll need ongoing support to keep you focused and moving 
forward.
Online forums can give you a place to vent and a sense that you’re 
not the only one going through this. Some sites that include single 
dad forums include

372      PART 5  What Happens When
Separating being a husband  
from being a father
Though the relationship with your partner is over, your relation-
ship with your kids continues and will last for as long as you live. 
For many years to come, there may be frustrations and difficulties 
when dealing with your ex, but it helps no one if you voice these 
feelings to your kids, who still have a loving relationship and bond 
with their mom, even if you don’t.
At the same time, it’s not helpful to lie to your children. They 
deserve to know what’s going on between the two most important 
people in their lives, but try not to couch the conflict in terms of 
who’s at fault or what one person did to another.
Instead, try to explain the situation to your kids by taking out the 
emotion. It’s easier said than done and takes some practice. The 
trick is in choosing your words carefully. You may find it helpful to 
think about or even write down what you want to say before you talk 
to your children. Try hard to describe the situation in neutral terms.
This leaves your children to make up their own minds about what 
is happening, and it fosters a safe and stress-free environment 
for them to share their own concerns. They’ll be more likely to 
feel comfortable asking questions and voicing how they feel about 
the situation.
Are You Still Dad?
With your family split in half, you may be asking yourself how 
you can continue to be the stellar father you’ve been so far. Now 
you’re either living away from your kids, which is the most com-
mon post-breakup situation, or their mother is away from the 
family home. What new responsibilities and roles do you have?
Who’ll look after the kids?
When you and your partner are no longer living together,  
you’ll need to work out who the children will live with as their 

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      373
primary caregiver and how the day-to-day care of your children 
will be managed.
You need to think about these issues:
»
» Who will your children live with most of the time?
»
» How will your children get to and from school and other 
activities? Who will pick up a younger child from day care or 
school?
»
» How often will the other parent be able to see the children?
»
» Who will look after the children on weekends, school 
vacations, and holidays?
Custody can be shared between the two of you, with time spent at 
both houses equally, or mainly at one parent’s house with visits 
to the other’s house. (We discuss custody arrangements in more 
detail later in this chapter.)
If you can agree with your former partner amicably about custody 
and time spent with the other parent, then you don’t need to go 
to court; you can work it out between you. You can write a non-
binding parenting plan or parenting agreement, so both of you are 
singing from the same song sheet and your children know what’s 
going on too. The court will also be satisfied as you go through 
the legal process of divorce that your children are in good hands.
But if you can’t agree about day-to-day care and the contact that 
the other parent has with the children, you’ll need to get legal advice 
and take the matter to court to get a parenting order or court order. 
This is an order made by the court deciding who will take care of 
the children on a day-to-day basis, and when other ­people, which 
may include you, can see your kids. Even if you and your former 
partner have agreed amicably about the care of your children with 
a parenting agreement or parenting plan, you can take it one step 
further and have it formalized by the court with a parenting order.
Being a remote or part-time father
An unfortunate consequence of separation and divorce is that 
a large number of fathers are separated from their children. 

374      PART 5  What Happens When
Separation should be no barrier to continuing to be a great dad 
and role model for your child or children.
There’s very little difference between the responsibilities of a 
nonresident father and a living-at-home father.
You don’t have to be going through separation to be regarded as a 
remote father. Fathers who are away overseas on military service, 
fathers who are in prison, and dads who are very busy or travel 
often can also be considered remote fathers.
Here are some tips for continuing to be a great dad, even though 
you can’t be there for every bedtime:
»
» Be punctual. If you’re expected at noon, be there at 12 p.m. 
sharp. Waiting around for you can be very hard on a young 
child, especially one who doesn’t understand why you don’t 
live at home anymore.
»
» Don’t slack off on all those fatherly duties you may have had 
when you were still living with your kids, such as discipline 
and encouraging their development. Be consistent with your 
rules and boundaries. As difficult as it may be, you also need 
to work hard to agree to some basic principles for disciplin-
ing your children with your ex. And of course, keep going 
with the principles of parenting — provide your child with 
love and warmth, a secure and safe environment, and lots of 
time spent listening to and talking with him.
»
» Foster a good working relationship with your child’s mother. 
Your child will pick up on when things aren’t going well 
between you two, so work hard at putting the anger, 
bitterness, or frustrations behind you.
»
» Keep your promises. If you told your child that you’d be 
there on Thursday to pick him up after school, then do it.
»
» Take care of yourself, mentally and physically. Being positive 
and happy is rough after separation and divorce, but it 
makes you a positive role model for your kids. Neglecting 
your basic needs (eating decent food, showering every day, 
getting some exercise, and keeping your place tidy) or 
turning your place into a new bachelor pad is not a great 
situation for your children to spend time with you.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      375
»
» Try to avoid falling into the trap of buying your kids special 
presents or taking them on special outings all the time in an 
attempt to be the favorite parent or to ensure they love you. 
They love you unconditionally, and the best things you can 
give them are your time, respect, and unconditional love.
»
» When you drop off your child at his mother’s house, try not 
to draw out the goodbyes like you’re about to go to the moon 
for a month. Normalize the situation by telling him good 
night, that you love him, and that you’ll see him very soon.
Your child may be feeling abandoned, resentful that you’ve left, or 
just plain confused about when he’ll see you again. Being on time 
and a man of your word means your little one can trust in you and 
believe in what you say. Remind him that even though you don’t 
live at his home anymore, you’ll always be there for him.
Understanding custody  
arrangements
When you’re not granted day-to-day care of your child or ­children, 
or it just works out better for your family situation that your chil-
dren live with their mother, you’ll still have time with your kids.
Custody arrangements range from shared 50/50 (though you’re 
not listed as the primary caregiver) to strict supervised access with 
time restraints in an enclosed area if the children are believed to 
be at risk.
At first it can be tough to accept that you need to put special time 
aside to see your kids when you used to be around them all the 
time. Work hard to make the most of the time you have with your 
little ones.
Here are some tips to make custody arrangements work smoothly 
for both parents and children:
»
» Communicate with anyone you need to about how the 
contact arrangements are working out. If they’re not 
working, talk to your ex or lawyer about changing them.

376      PART 5  What Happens When
»
» Don’t complain to your children about the time or circum-
stances around your custody arrangements. They can’t do 
anything about the arrangements, and your complaining will 
just make them feel bad.
»
» If the time you have together is limited, plan what you’re 
going to do well in advance by asking your children what 
they would like to do a few days beforehand.
»
» If you’re going to be late or there’s a change of plans, let 
people affected know as soon as you can.
»
» Keep a good working relationship with their mom. Your kids 
will pick up on any tensions between you and your ex, and 
those feelings will dampen their excitement.
»
» Keep your word. Don’t let your kids down by not showing up 
or by promising something you can’t commit to, like a 
weekend at the beach or a special gift.
»
» Try not to ask your kids to spy on their mother for you. She’s 
getting on with her life, and so are you! Asking them to spy 
puts your kids in the middle of your conflict, which isn’t fair 
for such little people to cope with. Your children love both of 
you — don’t ask them to choose.
»
» Try not to bad-mouth your former partner, even if you find 
out your partner does this about you — again, be the bigger 
man. Your children still love their mom. Blaming your ex may 
eventually make your children defend your ex’s actions.
»
» When making special arrangements for yourself or your 
child, remember to notify your ex-partner and any persons 
or organization involved in the access arrangements of your 
intentions. Give them plenty of notice.
The most important thing, whether you’re in charge of day-to-day 
care or have limited contact with your children, is that you enjoy 
the time you have together.
For the nitty gritty about parenting orders, parenting plans, and 
guardianship of a child or children, the website family.findlaw.
com/child-custody/the-various-types-of-child-custody.
html defines different types of custody arrangements and how 
they work.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      377
Paying child support
Though you and your former partner have split up, both of you still 
have to pay for your children’s food, clothes, housing, school fees, 
and all those other expenses like pocket money and sports fees. 
It usually falls on the shoulders of the guardian or ­custodian — 
that’s whoever manages the children’s day-to-day care — but 
between the two of you, you can work out a mechanism so both of 
you pay your way.
If you’re the guardian or custodian of your child or children, ask 
yourself these things when making a child support agreement 
with your former partner:
»
» What costs are involved in bringing up children? What special 
expenses do your children incur, like extracurricular 
activities, medical expenses, or special dietary requirements?
»
» Have you captured all costs accurately and fairly, such as by 
keeping receipts, so you can explain how you got to a total 
figure?
»
» Are you on any benefits that may affect the amount of child 
support you are entitled to? How will child support payments 
affect your eligibility for benefits?
In some cases, where there’s been a nasty split or reaching an 
agreement without resorting to other means isn’t possible, the 
guardian parent can get child support from the ex-partner with 
the help of government agencies.
Seeking guardianship  
of your children
The care of your child used to be called custody, but it is now 
called day-to-day care of your child or children. If you and your 
former partner can’t agree who’ll be the main caregiver for your 
child and you’re determined that it should be you, you’ll have 
to seek custody through whichever court in your state handles 
child custody cases. Your lawyer can help guide you through this 
­process. If you’re successful, you’ll be named the guardian or 
custodian of your child.

378      PART 5  What Happens When
Applying for a parenting order can be a very challenging, 
­emotional, and stressful endeavor, as well as being very time-
consuming and expensive. The process of applying for a parenting 
order depends on your expectations and your former partner’s 
expectations, and the ability to make an agreement that serves 
the best interests of the children involved. You’ll need to get a 
lawyer who specializes in family law.
When you set out to gain guardianship of your children, ask your-
self whether what you’re doing is in the best interests of the kids 
or yourself. Be honest about your motivation. As tempting as it 
may seem, try hard not to use guardianship of your child as a 
way of getting back at your ex. Guardianship and contact arrange-
ments are always done for the maximum benefits of the children, 
not either of the parents.
Before you start the process to claim guardianship, check the fol-
lowing. Are you
»
» Able to commit to being in charge of your children by yourself? 
Bear in mind that at times you’ll be sick, have a stressful period 
at work, or start seeing another person. Are you sure you’re 
up for having the day-to-day care of your children?
»
» Concerned about your children’s safety if they stay in your 
former partner’s care? Then you’re totally justified in 
attempting to get a parenting order.
»
» Trying to have the children with you because you don’t want 
your ex to have them? This is not a good reason for trying to 
get a parenting order.
Gaining guardianship of children should only be about what is 
best for the children and never about personal gain and pride. Be 
honest and real about your expectations and try never to lose your 
cool and get angry during the process.
Also ask yourself these questions:
»
» Have you worked out what child support you may be eligible 
for? Are you financially able to take care of your children by 
yourself if child support isn’t forthcoming?

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      379
»
» How practical is it for you to be guardian? What help do you 
need from your former partner to pick up your kids from 
school or day care?
»
» Would your children be happy living with you? Are you living 
near their friends, other relations, and familiar haunts?
The following may help you on your path to guardianship:
»
» Ensure you’re well set-up to look after your child or children, 
with a clean and child-friendly home close to their school.
»
» Dress well when going to any appointments or hearings with 
family court judges.
»
» Always keep in mind that you’re seeking day-to-day care of 
your children because it’s in the best interests of your kids. 
That will help you stay motivated when things get rough.
»
» Keep a record of the time you spend with your kids at the 
moment, with receipts and notes on interactions with your 
former partner.
If you really think about it and decide that being your children’s 
guardian isn’t in their best interests after all, don’t be afraid to 
stand up and say so. Be upfront with your lawyer and your former 
partner. It’s better to find out now than when your children come 
to live with you. Perhaps after admitting it, you’ll be able to reach 
an amicable voluntary agreement with your former partner about 
shared arrangements or contact time.
At all times act with dignity and integrity. Think of how your chil-
dren will remember you during these trying times when they’ve 
grown up and have families of their own.
Getting advice
You probably know from when your child was a newborn baby 
that every man and his dog like to give you advice. Sometimes the 
advice is helpful; sometimes it’s not. Ultimately you have to make 
the decisions. Do what you can to avoid poor choices because you 
got carried away.

380      PART 5  What Happens When
The advice that will be truly useful and beneficial to you is any-
thing that gets you through this time and on to happier, greener 
pastures, even if the advice is hard to hear, such as being told to 
get off the couch, stop wallowing in misery, and shave. Sometimes 
that’s just what you need to hear to move you forward. Anyone 
who allows (or encourages) you to keep resenting and blaming 
your former partner for everything is not doing you any favors.
Counseling and support
If you’re struggling to deal with day-to-day tasks or feel ­hopeless 
about your future, get some professional help quickly! It’s easy — 
look on the Internet and then pick up the phone to call a coun-
selor, therapist, your doctor, or your pastor (or other spiritual 
adviser) for help. Don’t try to bulldoze your way through without 
help; you can find yourself in a much deeper mental hole very 
quickly.
Hiring a lawyer
Navigating the legal system is tricky, but a good lawyer can help 
you negotiate your way through parenting orders, contact agree-
ments, and your divorce. They know the legal system and have 
experience in dealing with these matters. Many specialize in fam-
ily matters like parenting orders and divorce.
When looking for a lawyer, ask yourself these things:
»
» Does he explain proceedings and your part in them 
adequately?
»
» Does he advise you what to do rather than tell you?
»
» Are you bamboozled by what he says, or do you feel fully 
informed?
This is about the future of your family, and you should feel com-
fortable that your lawyer is representing you skillfully in a way 
you’re comfortable with.
Finding a private lawyer who specializes in divorce and/or cus-
tody issues is simple. Finding the right lawyer may not be. Many 
offer one free consultation, which is a good way to find some-
one you’re comfortable working with. If you can’t afford legal 

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      381
fees (which can reach stratospheric heights), your local Legal Aid 
office can help.
Becoming the Primary  
Caregiver
You have either been granted a parenting order by the courts or 
negotiated with your former partner to be the primary caregiver. 
It’s more unusual for dads to be primary caregivers than it is for 
moms, so take pride that you’re blazing a trail for dads every-
where! As the primary caregiver, you’re in charge of your kids. 
Whenever you have to make a decision about your family, keep in 
mind that the kids come first.
Coming to terms with being  
a primary caregiver
Having day-to-day care of your children on your own can be both 
exciting and terrifying. Being primary caregiver is a huge respon-
sibility, and you need to take a lot into consideration:
»
» How do you look after yourself in all this?
»
» How will you handle contact arrangements with your former 
partner? How often will your children see your former 
partner’s family?
»
» Where will you find the money for mortgage payments or 
rent, food, clothes and school uniforms, school fees, doctor’s 
visits, transport, school supplies, extracurricular activities, 
and sports fees? Will you work, or receive welfare or child 
support payments?
»
» How much time will you have for paid employment? How will 
you juggle your children’s school and sports schedules?
»
» How are you going to sort out life with your children if you 
have a new partner?

382      PART 5  What Happens When
At times it may seem daunting to be a single dad, but plenty of 
single moms are out there looking after children and doing a 
bang-up job. As we’ve always maintained, a dad can do just as 
good a job as a mom! It helps to have a routine and make sure your 
kids know what’s happening. Enlisting family (both yours and, if 
practical, your former partner’s) to give you some space or help 
with pick-ups or babysitting from time to time also helps.
See Chapter  16 about stay-at-home dads, a good place to start 
for more information about all the things you need to know/do/
remember when being the primary caregiver.
Being the primary caregiver for your children is a great thing, as 
well as a big responsibility. But just think — your daughter will 
learn what sort of man she may want in her life, and your son 
will learn what sort of man he wants to be from the examples you 
provide as you bring them up. How cool is that?
Supporting your children’s mother
Even though you’re not partners in a romantic sense, you and 
your children’s mother are still partners in a parenting sense. 
Whatever happened during the marriage or partnership that 
caused the breakdown and separation, it’s time to let go of the 
negative ­feelings — the hurt, the resentment, the anger — and 
get on with raising your children as best as you can.
Your children need their mother around. Although she doesn’t 
live with your children anymore, she can see them all the time 
and have a close, loving bond with them.
What can you do to support the relationship between your kids 
and their mom? Here are some ideas:
»
» Just like bedtime and dinnertime, you might like to make 
mom time a daily ritual. Mom could call at the same time 
each night to say good night or read a bedtime story on 
the phone. If she lives nearby, she could come over for half 
an hour at the same time each night to tuck the children in.
»
» Keep your children’s mother up to date with your children’s 
progress at school, any special events that are coming up, or 
parent–teacher evenings she should attend.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      383
»
» Keep your negative comments about your kids’ mom to 
yourself — bad-mouthing her to your children is not okay. 
They love their mother and have trust in her, and eroding 
those feelings helps no one.
»
» Realize your former partner may be feeling inadequate or 
irresponsible as a mother. Appreciate that this arrangement 
is probably quite tough for her.
»
» Share pictures, stories, artwork, and school successes with 
your former partner so she still feels a part of what the 
children are up to when she’s not there.
»
» Try not to be too rigid with contact arrangements. Go easy 
on your ex-partner if she’s a little late. At the beginning she 
may be a bit nervous or unsure of how her relationship with 
her kids is going to work out. Make sure the kids are ready to 
go when she arrives and pack their bags so she’s not caught 
out without diapers or sippy cups.
Seeking help and assistance
As the primary caregiver of the children, you may require some 
(or loads) of help and assistance. You shouldn’t hold back from 
making use of what is available. This book, for example, is written 
with the idea that dads are just as good parents as moms and can 
do everything moms can do (except breastfeed and be pregnant, 
of course). No part of this book relies on mom to do anything — 
you can do it all!
Parenting courses
In some cases, courts can require you to complete online par-
enting courses during the divorce process. Websites such as 
positiveparenting.com can provide you with a list of acceptable 
courses. The government website at www.fatherhood.gov/for- 
dads/connect-with-programs can help you find local programs 
in your state as well as provide other sources of information that 
can help you be the best parent possible.

384      PART 5  What Happens When
Financial help
Contact the appropriate government department to see whether 
you’re eligible for any benefits or tax credits. The website at 
www.irs.gov/uac/Ten-Facts-about-the-Child-Tax-Credit 
can give you information on whether or not you qualify, based on 
your income and other factors.
Getting out and about
Just knowing you’re part of a wider network of dads raising their 
kids alone and well is invaluable. It’s also really healthy for your 
kids to know they’re not the only ones dealing with mom and dad 
being apart. If parents’ groups or dads’ groups are close to where 
you are, join in so you can network with other parents.
Personal help
The end of a relationship can bring up some personal issues. You 
may realize you need help with anger management, self-esteem, 
or managing stress. Don’t procrastinate — if you feel you could 
benefit from a coach, therapist, or other specialist, pick up the 
phone or search the Internet. Your kids need you to be the best 
dad you can be, so if that means getting a bit of help, just do it. 
See “Finding good support” and “Getting advice” earlier in this 
chapter.
Having fun
Despite everything that has happened, spending time with your 
children is still generally great fun. But you may encounter some 
times when it isn’t so much fun. When you’ve had a rough day in 
the office and come home to bills in the mail and children who 
turn up their noses at their dinner, just stop for a moment and 
clear your head. Take a look at your children’s faces. Remember 
how much you love them and how they make you smile and laugh. 
Your children are worth every bit of extra effort in the end.
Your children will bring you more joy than frustration if you’re 
open to it.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      385
Play and interact with your children as much as you can. Read 
books together, give them lots of hugs, and let yourself be a bit 
silly with them. Children can learn so much from an involved and 
caring father.
If you’re an older dad, constant playing can take a toll on you, so 
get other family members involved, set up play dates, and share 
the fun, while you spend time with adults watching the children 
have fun. Actually, you don’t need to be an older parent to do 
this — it’s highly recommended for parents of all ages!
Introducing a Stepmom
Wanting to find another partner, or at least have a romantic rela-
tionship with someone new, is natural. Your life doesn’t have to 
be all about being a father and working to support your family. 
But beware — you’re not the carefree single man you used to be. 
You now come with extras.
When you go on dates or meet someone you’d like to be more than 
friends with, be honest from the outset that you have ­children. 
With the high rate of relationship breakups, it’s no longer unusual 
to be single with kids, so you needn’t feel self-conscious about 
it. By letting this person know you have kids from the outset, 
you’re letting her know how important your children are to you. 
Some women may not want to get involved with a man who has 
­children — that’s okay, their loss.
Talking about a new partner  
to your children
The idea of a new special person in your life after all the mess 
and trauma of their parents’ breakup may be tough for your chil-
dren to deal with at first. Initially your children may be confused 
when they think of how you used to be with their mom and now 
they’re seeing you with another woman. When you start dating 
or have met someone special, talk to your children about why 
you want to date and what it means for your family. Take things 

386      PART 5  What Happens When
slowly and don’t rush your children into anything they’re not 
­comfortable with.
Thinking this new person is going to replace their mother may 
be very painful for your children. The reality is that children are 
likely to think of their birth mom as “mom,” but over time they 
can get used to the idea of having two moms.
Give your children lots of time and let them know they can ask 
you lots of questions about your new partner. Be aware that your 
children may be resistant to the idea of your new partner. If pos-
sible, get their ideas for the first meeting and involve them some-
how. It may be easier for your children to deal with the situation if 
they feel they have some sort of say over what happens.
Your children may be secretly hoping that you and their mom are 
going to get back together. The idea of a new romance in your life 
will mean that’s not going to happen and can be tough for your 
kids to deal with.
Surviving the meet and greet
When you have found the right person, she’ll one day need to 
meet your children, and your children will want to meet her. The 
meeting doesn’t have to be stressful; it can be as simple as hav-
ing any of your friends over to visit. You may want to choose this 
first meeting to happen in a neutral area, like a park, playground, 
or café. Keep it short, sweet, and casual, and don’t push your kids 
into liking this new person.
After a few visits, chances are your children will get used to hav-
ing your new girlfriend around. Again, never push them into lik-
ing her. It can take years for children to accept that a new person 
is around and that she’s going to become part of the family.
Make it clear to your kids that your new partner or girlfriend isn’t 
replacing their mother, but is an addition to the family. Continue 
to support the relationship between your kids and former partner, 
and make her a priority in your kids’ lives. Ask her to do the same 
if she gets involved with another partner as well.

CHAPTER 19  Separation and Divorce      387
This situation is probably pretty intense for your new partner too. 
Listen to the concerns she may have. Just as in any good rela-
tionship, you should foster an environment of open communica-
tion, where all of you can talk openly about anything, including 
feelings.
Getting remarried
If the time comes that you and your new partner decide to get 
married, get your kids involved with the whole shebang. Ask them 
what they would like to do. Tell them that this is a very special 
day for you, and it would be even more special if they helped. 
Cut them some slack if they’re not hugely enthusiastic about you 
getting remarried. After all, they may still be clinging to the way 
things used to be with you and their mom being married.
Make sure you don’t get so wrapped up in the event on the day 
that you don’t notice your children looking lost and feeling side-
lined. It can be helpful to have family dedicated to looking out for 
them and to give them loads of hugs and kisses, because the wed-
ding’s a big day for them too. They now have a stepmom!

Ten Ways to 
Improve Your

Pregnancy 
Experience
P
regnancy looks easy when it’s happening to someone else. 
As a man, you don’t have to endure what’s going on in a 
pregnant woman’s body 24/7 — and there’s a lot going on. 
Media depictions of pregnancy have led us to believe that a woman 
demurely throws up a few times, and then swells elegantly into a 
glowing, radiant, Venus figure, à la Angelina Jolie. Finally, birth is 
quick with a few screams, and voilà, a beautiful baby is here.

392      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Not so. Turn to Chapter 3 for what really happens when your part-
ner is pregnant, and then help her get through it by trying a few 
of these tips.
Take Care of Your Partner
Growing a baby is hard work and takes quite a physical toll on a 
woman’s body. Sure, some women climb mountains and run mar-
athons up to the day they give birth, but those are exceptions rather 
than your average woman’s pregnancy experience. For starters, 
morning sickness can be debilitating, and for some women the 
morning sickness never eases until the pregnancy is over.
The tiredness and carrying around all that blood, fluid, and an 
extra person puts all sorts of strains on the female body. Look 
after your partner 24/7 if need be, especially if she’s having a dif-
ficult pregnancy, and do all you can to make life easier for her. 
It may mean looking after the household for nine months all by 
yourself, and for sure you’ll get sick of it. But let’s face it — would 
you prefer to squeeze a baby out of your body? So, man up and do 
whatever needs doing in the house. You can take it one step fur-
ther and really pamper your mom-to-be by painting her toenails, 
giving her a foot rub, or helping her rub oil onto her belly.
Get on the Wagon
Your partner has to stay off alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, blue cheese, 
seafood, and a whole lot of other stuff to keep that baby in there 
safe and sound. Seeing you downing a pint of beer and enough 
salami to sink a small ship could be enough to send her over the 
edge. Staying off alcohol and cigarettes, not to mention anything 
heavier you may be into, and eating what she can eat is not only 
better for you, but it sets up a precedent for how you intend to live 
as a father.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Ways to Improve Your Partner’s Pregnancy Experience      393
Give Your Partner Some “Me” 
Time Every Now and Then
The prospect of becoming a mother, while really exciting for your 
partner, is also a daunting one, both mentally and physically. For 
most mothers, the first few months after birth end up being a 
24-hour, seven-days-a-week job. Even though they traded in 
their old life of meetings, schedules, work commitments, and 
deadlines that they may have no sentimental attachment to, for 
the care of a tiny, helpless baby whom they love, the role can be 
overwhelming.
During pregnancy, your partner is bound to have some trepida-
tion about her new responsibility and how she’ll cope. Over the 
next few years — perhaps until your child has left home — your 
partner’s always going to have one eye on what she’s doing and 
one eye on your child. So in the months before this all kicks off, 
let her have some time that’s just for her.
Be There for the Medical Stuff
Go along to all the medical appointments, scans, and meetings 
with your midwife or obstetrician. Your partner will want you to 
be there to share in it. The first time you hear your baby’s heart-
beat through the Doppler or see the faint shadows of your baby 
moving and bouncing around in your partner’s belly during an 
ultrasound scan, you’ll be glad you came along.
Although you’re not carrying the baby right now, that tiny grow-
ing thing in there is your child too. Your place is to know about 
how well he’s developing, any potential health issues, and what 
options you as a couple have for welcoming your child into the 
world.
Going to appointments also supports your partner because, in the 
event of any unwelcome news, you’ll be there to help her.

394      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Get with the Program
Start getting some hands-on practice with essential baby knowl-
edge and skills. Moms-to-be love to see their partners getting 
excited about their new life as parents, and what better way to 
show it than to throw yourself into the preparations? There’s so 
much to learn about looking after a newborn baby and the months 
after that, so why not find out all you can about it?
Ask your midwife or obstetrician about prenatal classes in your 
area and discuss which one you think would suit you and your 
partner best. Make it a priority to never miss a class, even if there’s 
work to be done at the office or you’ve been invited to drinks after 
work. Let’s face it; the office and your work will be there for a long 
time. Preparing for your first child happens only once in your life.
Go on a Babymoon
As a couple, now is the perfect time to take a relaxing and indul-
gent holiday somewhere. We’re not talking about backpacking 
through India or somewhere hot, with wild animals and tons of 
people, but somewhere low-key. Someplace where lounge chairs 
and swimming pools are more common than office buildings, 
with great restaurants and shops to browse. Somewhere the two 
of you can just hang out, sleep late, read books, and do whatever 
you want when you want.
Check with your healthcare provider before heading off to parts 
unknown. She may suggest not traveling for a certain number of 
weeks before your partner’s due date or to certain parts of the world.
Be Excited about  
Becoming a Dad
Finding out you’re going to be a dad is a little scary. You may have 
some reservations because of your own childhood, your financial 

CHAPTER 20  Ten Ways to Improve Your Partner’s Pregnancy Experience      395
situation, or the responsibility you’re going to have. Your partner 
may also share some of those worries and concerns, but bury-
ing your head in the sand and pretending the baby’s not going to 
arrive won’t help.
Even if the impending change of lifestyle takes a while to sink in, 
you can definitely make the pregnancy experience more enjoyable 
for your partner if you show a bit of excitement about becoming a 
dad. Showing your partner that you’re excited will get her excited 
and happy about becoming a mom. You want her to be happy and 
excited.
A lot of parenting is about attitude. The anecdote about dealing 
with picky eaters really sums this up. One father complains that 
his daughter is a terrible eater and won’t eat anything unless it 
has cheese on it. He’s really stressed out about it and is pulling 
his hair out thinking of a solution. On the other hand, another 
father happily tells the first guy that his son is a terrific eater 
because as long as it has cheese on it, he’ll eat anything. It’s all 
about attitude.
Celebrate!
In a few months when the baby is born, you’ll be celebrating a 
new person’s presence in your life. Not just any new person, but 
the person who is on this Earth because of you. That’s pretty spe-
cial! But it does come with a price — temporary sleep deprivation 
and a restricted social life.
So make the most of your quiet nights and unlimited access to 
the outside world now! Take your partner out for a posh dinner 
somewhere fancy, visit a special place together — do whatever 
spins your wheels as a couple.
One dad-to-be surprised his partner with a picnic lunch at the 
local zoo in the weeks before their baby was born. He’d even 
packed sparkling grape juice to toast their health and a pillow for 
his partner to sit on. She spent most of her time waddling back and 
forth from the restroom, but the gesture was most appreciated.

396      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Record That Beautiful Belly
In our great-grandmothers’ and grandmothers’ days, having a 
whole litter of children was common, and the pregnant belly was 
hidden away as if it were some kind of obscenity. These days, 
though, it’s rare to have more than five or six children, and more 
usual for a woman to have one to three children in her lifetime.
Celebrating the physical changes that take place during preg-
nancy (not the heartburn and hemorrhoids, mind you), such as 
the voluptuous new shape of a pregnant belly and those plus-
sized breasts that you gotta love, is now more usual. Most preg-
nant women, while despising the weight they put on, love their 
bellies, so get out your camera from week one and get snapping. 
You’ll laugh when you look back and see how your baby grew 
even before you got to meet your little one. Even better, hire a 
professional photographer to take some shots of your partner’s 
gorgeous shape. Professional photos will help her feel sexy and 
beautiful and boost her confidence.
Keep Telling Your Partner  
How Beautiful She Is
For many women, the hardest part of pregnancy is near the due 
date. Your partner may be having a difficult time getting com-
fortable at night and suffering from heartburn, hemorrhoids, and 
various aches and pains. She may have stretch marks, and her legs 
and feet may be sausage-shaped. Your partner’s tired all the time 
but can’t sleep. She wants her body back but is frightened about 
how she’s going to handle giving birth.
You, as your partner’s great ally, her support, and her rock, will 
earn mega brownie points and endear yourself to her always if 
you keep telling her how beautiful she is. She wants to know that 
you still find her attractive and that she’s still, despite everything 
going on in her body, the hot woman you fell in love with — not 
just because of the way she looks, but because of who she is and 
the fact that she’s going to make a wonderful mother.

B
onding and forming an attachment to his caregivers allows 
your child to feel secure so he can focus on growth and 
development to become independent and self-confident in 
the world at large. He’s half your DNA, so shouldn’t bonding 
­happen by default? Yes and no. Bonding is a process that needs to 
be worked at, but it’s not hard, and because you’re the adult, 
you’ll have to lead the way at the beginning. In this chapter, we 
give you our favorite ways to get to know your baby and let him 
get to know you.

398      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Be 100 Percent Committed
Make a point of totally committing yourself mentally to looking 
after your little one, not just on a day-to-day basis, but for life. 
Becoming a father is like getting married — you’re in this thing 
for better or worse, in sickness and in health. But there’s one big 
difference — if things don’t work out, there’s no divorce. Your 
child will be your child forever. And because this is your child’s 
one shot at life, give your little one the best shot you can.
It’s a little bit like the Dr. Seuss book Horton Hatches the Egg, which 
you’ll probably come across in the course of your fathering duties. 
The story tells of a lazy bird that sits on her egg but gets bored 
and wants a vacation. So she asks Horton, an elephant, to sit on 
the egg for her. Horton sits on the nest and endures snowstorms, 
being hunted, and the ridicule of his friends because he said he’d 
be 100 percent dedicated to sitting on the egg. When the egg 
hatches, it’s Horton the baby bird feels connected to and wants to 
be with, not the lazy bird who wasn’t there for her.
Be at the Birth
The first time you lay eyes on your long-awaited baby is inde-
scribable. Some fathers say the world changed in an instant, and 
the instinct to protect their vulnerable new child was overwhelm-
ing. Others say it took them a few weeks to truly feel special about 
their child. Either way, seeing your baby for the first time is a 
once-in-a-lifetime event that’s not to be missed. It’s an exclusive 
gig that’s happening for three people, and you’ve got a backstage 
pass, so use it!
If you’re at the birth, you not only get to see the amazing process 
of birth itself, but you also get to take part! You get to hold your 
baby (often even before your partner), you get to mop up your 
partner’s blood (just kidding), and you can cut the umbilical cord 
(if you can muster the courage).
And while mom is getting a bit of a rest and some attention from 
the medical staff, you’ll have a chance to check out your precious 
new little parcel in detail. Don’t forget to take lots of photos!

CHAPTER 21  Ten Ways to Bond with Your Newborn Baby      399
Get Up Close and Personal
Newborn babies have spent their entire lives inside a person, so it 
makes sense that your little one will still want to be close to the peo-
ple who love him — that’s first and foremost, you and your partner. 
And what better way to be close than skin-to-skin? Your newborn 
will love snuggling into your chest, be it thick with hair or not, so 
whip off that shirt and cuddle. Kangaroo care, as skin-to-skin con-
tact is sometimes known, is a technique used in the care of prema-
ture babies to facilitate better breastfeeding, temperature control, 
bonding, and attachment. But your baby doesn’t have to be pre-
mature to benefit. He’ll learn your smell and your sound, and love 
listening to the gentle thud of your heartbeat putting him to sleep.
Another way to get some close contact with your baby is to take 
a bath or shower with him. Wait until the belly button is fully 
healed. You may feel a bit clumsy with a wobbly, tiny baby, but 
after a few attempts you’ll feel more confident. Let your baby rest 
on your chest in the tub. Have mom nearby to hand you the baby 
when you’re settled in the bath, and give her a call to take the 
baby out when you’re finished. Be careful that the water isn’t too 
hot, or the room too chilly, as your baby doesn’t have good con-
trol over his temperature yet. Some newborns will object loudly 
to having to take a bath, but by taking your baby in the bath with 
you, you can make it much easier for him. After your little one 
gets the hang of bathing with you, he’ll love bath time even more 
because it means he gets to hang out with dad.
Ready, Set . . . Read!
Your newborn baby loves lots of things. She especially loves 
spending time with you and everything she can find out about 
you, such as your smell, the sound of your voice, the shape of 
your face, and the color of your eyes. Reading to your baby from 
day one not only encourages closeness, but it also gives her a 
chance to see colors and shapes and listen to your voice. Your 
little tyke can’t tell whether you’re speaking Spanish or Swahili, 
but she adores the sound of your voice, your smell, and being 
close to you. As your baby grows up and becomes more aware  

400      PART 6  The Part of Tens
of her surroundings, she’ll learn that books are just a normal, 
everyday part of life that have always been there.
Being read to also helps with language development, which starts 
happening on day one. Before she can speak, she’ll be learning 
through you about the colors, shapes, animals, and emotions that 
she sees on the pages in front of her.
Engage in Tummy Time
Tummy time is an important technique in kick-starting your 
child’s development. Simply lay your baby on his tummy (he’ll have 
his knees curled under him to start with) and encourage him to lift 
his head. This is important because it gets him to use his neck and 
upper body muscles, and encourages him to look ahead and focus 
on objects. As he gets older, tummy time helps him develop cross-
line movement, which is the action a baby does when he crawls.
Start with just a few minutes a day and build up from there. Most 
newborns aren’t that fond of tummy time. Tummy time is hard 
work for them, so expect a bit of resistance at first. But keep at 
it because tummy time helps your baby develop on many levels.
Be Hands-On — Literally
Baby massage is a technique that every dad should have in his 
repertoire. Baby massage is easy to learn, and both you and your 
newborn will love it. Start by bathing your baby; then dry her on 
her change table or a similar flat surface. Make sure the room 
you’re in is warm, just like when you go for a massage. Get some 
natural oil, like calendula, or a commercial product made espe-
cially for babies and start massaging. Use gentle strokes up and 
down your baby’s limbs, and gently roll her over to rub her back. 
Use your thumbs to gently knead her legs and feet.
If you want to get more technical about baby massage, a variety of 
instructional videos and booklets are available.

CHAPTER 21  Ten Ways to Bond with Your Newborn Baby      401
Be the Paparazzi
In the first year of his life, your baby will change so much that you 
may not recognize pictures taken on the day he was born when 
you look at them on his first birthday! He’ll grow out of his new-
born face into a smiley, chubby-cheeked cutie pie, his hair will 
fall out and grow back again, and his eyes will begin to change 
into their true color.
The first year is also populated by so many firsts that your head 
will spin: first smile, first bath, first outing, first swimming 
­lesson, first bump or bruise, and (possibly) first steps. So take 
lots of photos in lots of different settings. Before too long, you’ll 
be looking at the photos and getting all nostalgic.
Put the photos on your phone, on your work computer, on your 
desk, and in your wallet. Immerse yourself in the world of your 
little one. If you work outside the home, photos can be a great way 
to remember during the day that you’re a dad now, and it means 
you’ll look forward to going home to check on your little one. If 
you’re a stay-at-home dad, taking photos can help you remember 
the good days when you’re having some bad ones and will help 
keep mom in the loop about what you’ve been up to with your 
baby during the day.
Get Creative
Remember that beloved toy truck your granddad carved for you, 
the one that’s gathering dust in your spare room? Or the quilt 
that an aunt made for you when you were a baby? Things that are 
handmade by people who love you not only show you how much 
they care for you, but they can also become precious heirlooms 
passed down from generation to generation.
Make a future heirloom now by making a mobile, some wooden 
toys, or decorations like murals for your baby’s room. You’ll get 
untold pleasure from seeing your child use and enjoy whatever 
you make or fall in love with a painting you’ve made for her.

402      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Take a Walk
You never would have seen a man pushing a stroller when we 
were kids, but now pushing the stroller — or running with the 
jogger — is totally the “in” thing. And who doesn’t want to show 
off their stroller with all the adjustable this, that, and the other 
things strollers come with these days? As you take junior for a 
stroll, you can check out what models other dads have.
In the early weeks, have your child facing toward you, so that she 
can make out your familiar face and feel comforted by your pres-
ence. The more your newborn sees you, the more she’ll realize 
that you’re her dad. Some experts believe that all strollers should 
face toward the parent to encourage the two of you to talk and 
interact more.
Get Your Hands Dirty
Yep. You’re gonna have to change some diapers. Most dads don’t 
exactly relish the idea of dealing with urine and poop several 
times a day. Neither do moms. Changing diapers is a dirty job, but 
someone’s gotta do it. We strongly believe that real men change 
diapers. If you can’t handle a simple diaper change, you may have 
to hand in your man card for real!
But there are also fringe benefits to being a diaper changer. The 
distance between you and your little tyke when you change a 
­diaper is just perfect for singing and talking together. Many a new 
dad has seen his baby’s first smile while changing a diaper.
Your baby’s tiny little feet and gorgeous little tummy are at just 
the right distance for a little raspberry kiss too (after you’ve 
cleaned him and put a fresh diaper on!).
It’s the day-to-day care of your baby that tells him you care and 
can look after him when he needs it. That builds trust, a connec-
tion and an attachment your child needs to grow up feeling loved 
and secure.

Ten Ways to 
Engage with 
a Toddler
T
oddlers are funny little creatures. They’re curious and cute, 
interested yet impulsive, and are like little learning sponges 
soaking up everything they see, hear, and do. Playing with 
toddlers is really fun, and interacting is great for both of you. One 
of nature’s best tricks is that playing with you is a way of learning 
and developing for your child. In this chapter we give you lots of 
great ideas for having fun with your little one.
Building an Obstacle Course
Our top pick for busting boredom on a rainy day, or just for fun 
and everything in between, is to set up an obstacle course. Use 
chairs with a sheet draped over the top, coffee tables to crawl 

404      PART 6  The Part of Tens
under, big cardboard boxes to crawl through, toys or suitcases 
to maneuver around, and bean bags to shimmy over. Of course 
getting through the obstacle course is all the more fun for having 
to avoid the dad’o’saurus who threatens to tickle the hide off any 
toddler who doesn’t avoid him in time!
Getting Handy
Hand games like “Itsy Bitsy Spider” and “Twinkle Twinkle Little 
Star” are more than just a good time; they encourage the devel-
opment of hand–eye coordination, gross motor skills, language, 
and memory.
Playing Chase and Tag
Have you noticed that your little one loves it when you run after 
him and will encourage you to do so by taking off in the middle 
of a crowded street or near a busy road? Near a highway isn’t 
the best place to play tag or chase, but your backyard or home is. 
Chasing your toddler into another room and then having him hide 
when you come looking for him is an advanced form of peek-a- 
boo — it never fails to delight toddlers.
And what’s wrong with a little running around the house anyway? 
Running’s good for the heart and lungs and ensures your toddler 
sleeps well that night. And hey — it may even help you burn a few 
extra calories!
Putting Together Puzzles
Fitting shapes into a jigsaw puzzle is pretty easy for dads, but 
it wasn’t always. A lot is going on in your brain when you do a 
jigsaw. You need to identify colors and patterns and visualize the 
piece in a bigger picture, as well as have the motor skills necessary 

CHAPTER 22  Ten Ways to Engage with a Toddler      405
to make that piece fit. Doing a jigsaw puzzle is almost like rocket 
science for toddlers.
Best of all, jigsaws help your toddler develop his patience. What 
many parents don’t realize is that patience is a skill that needs to 
be learned, just like riding a bike or learning to swim. Patience is 
not something that some people have and others don’t — it needs 
to be learned and practiced regularly. Doing puzzles with your 
little one is the perfect way to practice patience.
Blowing Up Balloons
When was the last time you bought a bag of balloons and blew 
them up? Back in the 1980s at the “99 Red Balloons” party? Well, 
that’s about to change. Though your toddler may not understand 
how to blow up balloons, there’s nothing to stop you from doing 
it and letting them go so they whiz around the room in a crazy 
freefall. Toddlers love to look at balloons, play with balloons, have 
air come out of balloons in their faces, and watch balloons float 
into the sky. Balloons should be part of every great dad’s kit. Same 
goes for bubbles.
Balloons can present a choking hazard, so cleaning up all the 
deflated and/or broken balloons when you’re finished playing 
with them is also part of being a great dad.
Tossing Around a Ball
Like balloons, balls are an endless source of fascination for tod-
dlers. The unpredictability of where a ball is going to bounce, roll, 
or fall can keep a toddler engaged for whole . . . well, minutes 
anyway. Show your toddler how to throw a ball and watch how 
excited she becomes. Then try throwing the ball gently to her. She 
probably won’t catch it but will try again and again. And that’s 
how skills are learned — by repetition. At the beginning you can 
start engaging with your child by rolling a ball to her and get-
ting her to roll it back to you. As your child gets older you can do 

406      PART 6  The Part of Tens
trickier stuff with balls, until finally you can teach her (or learn 
with her) the art of juggling.
Don’t let your child play with balls small enough to fit into her 
mouth; she could choke on them.
Playing Water Games
Who would have thought that an old bucket, some empty drink 
bottles, and a little watering can could be a great investment 
for engaging with your child? Most children are fascinated by 
water play — the simple acts of pouring, splashing, and swish-
ing develop their motor skills and their spatial awareness. Have a 
water “play set” ready to go on warm days, and show your child 
how to water the garden or the balcony plants.
You may want to take this a step further and enroll your toddler in 
swimming lessons. Swimming lessons for toddlers usually entail 
just playing in the water and building up confidence in the pool.
A small child can drown in a puddle of water. Stay vigilant and 
never leave your child alone — not even for a minute — when 
playing with or around water.
Creating Art
Every culture in the world has a concept of art as a way of express-
ing itself. Children do too. Get messy with finger paints, crayons, 
pencils, and felt pens. This lets your children explore schema —  
repetitive patterns and shapes that develop a child’s brain. He’ll 
also get the hang of the idea of writing and holding a pen in a 
certain way, and you’ll begin to see more recognizable shapes and 
themes as he grows up.

CHAPTER 22  Ten Ways to Engage with a Toddler      407
Encouraging a Love of Reading
You can’t read enough to your child. As time passes, you’ll find 
story time before bed, whether you’re perched in bed together or 
sitting in a favorite armchair, one of the highlights of your day. 
Many a father knows Goodnight Moon, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, 
or The Cat in the Hat by heart from his many story times with his 
children.
Reading together isn’t just about the words on the page, just as 
eating together isn’t just about food. Reading together is about 
spending time together, exploring a new world together, and pro-
viding a safe, secure place for your child to be.
Children learn by repetition and often want you to read to them 
the same story over and over again. So go with it, and soon your 
little one will be reciting Goodnight Moon back to you. Don’t forget 
to stop at each page and see which things your child can point out 
or name as you go.
Stacking Blocks and Building
Most toddlers are fascinated by textures, colors, and stacking 
things. Sit down with your child on a rainy day with a bucket 
of blocks, and you may not get up again for an hour or so. Not 
only will you get a kick out of making the perfect Lego spaceship, 
but you may also discover that your child has just built the Eiffel 
Tower.
You can build all sorts of things from basic wooden blocks — 
garages for toy cars to be parked in, tunnels for trains to rumble 
through, houses for cuddly toys to sleep in. You’re limited only by 
your imagination.

APPENDIX A  Resources for Dads      415


Appendix B
Glossary
To help you understand the medical mumbo jumbo you may be 
exposed to during pregnancy or when visiting a pediatrician, 
we’ve compiled a list of the most commonly used terms.
APPENDIX B  Glossary      417
active movement: Developing your child’s fine and gross motor skills, 
cognitive skills, and senses by doing things like rolling on the floor, 
crawling, playing finger games, and climbing.
active phase: A phase of the first stage of labor, in which contractions 
are increasingly painful as the cervix is nearly completely dilated and 
getting ready to start pushing your baby out.
acute illness: A short-term illness.
allergens: Substances or materials that cause an allergic reaction or 
allergy. Examples include certain foods, grass, and animals. See also 
anaphylaxis.
allergy: When the body has an overactive immune system and reacts to 
particular substances, such as certain foods, grass, and animals, which 
are called allergens.
amniocentesis: A test to check for genetic birth defects like Down 
Syndrome. The test involves inserting a long, thin needle into the 
amniotic sac and drawing some amniotic fluid for testing. Amniocentesis 
is usually done around 16–20 weeks into the pregnancy. See also Down 
Syndrome.
amniotic fluid: Also called liquor amnii, this is the fluid that your baby 
floats around in, in the amniotic sac in the womb. When your partner’s 
“water breaks,” amniotic fluid is what comes out.
amniotic sac: The thin membrane that holds the amniotic fluid. When 
your partner’s “water breaks,” it’s the amniotic sac that leaks fluid.

418      PART 7  Appendixes
anaphylaxis: A life-threatening reaction to an allergen, in which parts of 
the face and body swell up and block airways. See also allergens.
Apgar score: A score from one to ten given to a newborn baby at one 
and five minutes after birth to determine his health and well-being.
assisted reproductive technologies: Using technologies such as IVF 
and IUI to get pregnant.
attachment parenting: A style of parenting in which close contact 
with the child is maintained at all times. Attachment parents co-sleep 
with their baby, breastfeed, and carry their baby in a sling or carrier 
rather than a stroller.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): A condition in 
which children have trouble concentrating and are easily distracted, 
hyperactive, and impulsive.
authoritarian parenting: A style of parenting in which children are told 
what to do, parents are to be obeyed, and rules must be observed.
authoritative parenting: A style of parenting in which children and 
parents have a give-and-take relationship. Parents have high expecta-
tions of children, and children have an open and honest relationship 
with parents.
autism: Also known as autism spectrum disorder because the range of 
severity differs from person to person. A person with autism may have 
trouble making sense of the world and find it difficult to communicate, 
cope in social situations, or control his emotions.
baby carrier: A back or front pack in which you carry a baby or small 
child on the body. Slings are another form of baby carrier.
bassinet: A basket on wheels for newborns to sleep in.
birth canal: A term used to describe your partner’s vagina during 
childbirth and labor.
birth plan: A document in which you and your partner make clear how 
you intend the birth of your child to go in the best-case scenario. A birth 
plan should also include which forms of pain relief your partner is open 
to or would like available, whether or not you want to cut the umbilical 
cord, who you want to have in the room with you, and which kinds of 
intervention you’re open to, if any.
birthing center: A specialized birthing unit run by midwives. Some 
birthing centers are attached to a hospital; others aren’t. Birthing cen-
ters aren’t available in all areas.

APPENDIX B  Glossary      419
bodysuit: A T-shirt that snaps at the crotch, making changing babies 
and young children simpler. This item is often called a onesie.
Braxton-Hicks contractions: The false contractions that many women 
experience in the weeks, days, or hours leading up to real labor starting.
breech: When your baby is “upside down,” meaning his feet rather than 
his head are pointing down, ready for birth.
bronchiolitis: An inflammation of the lungs’ airways. Your child will 
develop a nasty cough and may have trouble breathing. Go to your 
pediatrician.

patting her back.
cerebral palsy: A condition where parts of the brain are damaged 
during pregnancy or birth, or as the result of a lack of oxygen.
cervix: The opening between the uterus and vagina. The cervix is sealed 
shut during pregnancy and must widen far enough to let the baby 
through during labor.
cesarean section: A baby born by cesarean section is removed from 
the uterus through an incision in your partner’s belly. Cesareans are 
performed when labor has been going on too long, when there is some 
condition in which the baby must be born immediately, or when vaginal 
birth is too dangerous.
chickenpox: An infection that starts with a fever and cold symptoms. 
After a day or two, your child starts getting red, itchy blisters on her skin. 
You can calm the itch with calamine lotion from your pharmacy and give 
your child lots of soothing baths.
chloasma: Darkish patches that appear on a pregnant woman’s face, 
also known as the mask of pregnancy.
chronic illness: A long-term illness, such as asthma or diabetes.
cognitive skills: Thinking skills and the ability to grasp concepts.
colic: Persistent crying at certain times of the day, usually the early 
evening, for babies under three months. The cause of colic is unknown.

the eye are inflamed.
conscious fathering: Actively developing parenting skills and research-
ing information to understand why babies and children behave the way 

420      PART 7  Appendixes
they do. Respond to your children by using these skills and knowledge, 
rather than with a reaction picked up from your parents or others.
controlled crying: A technique in which a crying baby is comforted at 
regular intervals in an effort to help her learn to fall asleep on her own.
cord prolapse: A rare event in which the umbilical cord blocks the baby 
from being born.
cradle cap: A type of dermatitis that causes flakes on the scalp in young

digestive system.
day care: A facility where children under 5 years old are cared for, with 
programs to assist their learning and development. Day care centers are 
staffed by qualified early childhood teachers and aides.
demand feeding: Feeding a baby when she shows hunger cues such as 
turning her head to search for a nipple, crying, or sucking her fists.
developmental delay: Professionals say that a child has a developmen-
tal delay, rather than labeling the child intellectually disabled, when a 
child’s development lags behind average statistics on developmental 
milestones.
diaper cream: A cream you apply to a child’s bottom and genitals to 
prevent diaper rash.
diaper rash: A skin condition caused by the ammonia in urine and stool 
on your baby’s bottom and genitals. Diaper rash is usually red, flat, and 
quite sore.
dilation: A term used to describe the widening of the cervix ready for 
the baby to leave the uterus and enter the birth canal.
discipline: A term used to describe the way you show your children 
clear boundaries, rules, and consequences. It doesn’t mean punishing 
your child.

APPENDIX B  Glossary      421
dizygotic twins: Twins from two different eggs, also known as fraternal 
twins. These twins do not share identical genetic material as identical 
twins do. See also monozygotic twins.
Doppler: An instrument that allows you to hear the baby’s heart beating 
in the womb.
doula: A paid attendant, usually a woman, who helps support and coach 
a woman through labor and childbirth. Doulas are also called childbirth 
assistants. They’re not common in the United States yet, but more 
women are interested in having a doula, as moms and other female 
relatives who would provide support often live far away.
Down Syndrome: A genetic disorder caused by an extra bit of chromo-
some being replicated in cell division very early on after conception. 
Children with Down Syndrome have varying degrees of mental and 
sometimes physical disability.
due date: The date your baby should arrive, though this is not for 
certain, as only 5 percent of babies arrive on their due date (get used to 
the idea that you can’t plan everything by a watch or calendar when 
you’re a dad). The due date is technically called an EDC, or expected date 
of confinement.
ear infection: An infection of the ear, in which your child will be fussy 
and tug at or rub his ears. A trip to your pediatrician to check your 
child’s ears thoroughly and prescribe antibiotics is in order.
eczema: Also known as dermatitis. The skin is sensitive to certain 
materials and can become itchy and blotchy.
elimination communication: Rather than using diapers to catch urine 
and stool, parents watch their baby for signs they need to go to the 
toilet. The baby is then held over a potty.
embryo: What your unborn baby is called from the time it implants into 
the uterine wall to about 8–12 weeks into the pregnancy.
engaging: When an unborn baby is getting in position for birth.
epidural: A pain-relief method that involves a needle going into the 
spinal column with local anaesthetic. Epidurals are used in cesareans so 
that mom can stay awake and reasonably pain free while the baby is 
being born. See also cesarean section.
episiotomy: Cutting the perineum to make the vaginal opening bigger 
during labor.

422      PART 7  Appendixes
estrogen: Though estrogen courses through the bodies of both men 
and women, it’s found in much higher levels in women. Estrogen is 
known as the female sex hormone in the same way that testosterone is 
the male sex hormone. It’s responsible for the growth of breasts and 
contributes to the menstrual cycle in women.
extrusion reflex: A reflex in which a young baby pushes an object out 
of his mouth with his tongue. One of the signs that your baby’s ready to 
eat solids is when he stops automatically pushing things like spoons out 
of his mouth.
fallopian tubes: The tubes that connect the ovary with the uterus. An 
egg is often fertilized in one of the fallopian tubes and travels down the 
uterus to become an embryo.

are formed.
fetal alcohol syndrome: Condition caused by a woman drinking alcohol 
heavily in pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome manifests itself as a 
number of intellectual and behavioral problems in the child.

and contractions of the uterus to determine the unborn baby’s well-
being. Fetal monitors are used in prenatal checkups and in the early 
stages of labor.
fetus: What your unborn baby is called from the time it stops being an 
embryo, about 8–12 weeks into the pregnancy, until birth.
finger food: When your baby is about eight to nine months old, she 
becomes interested in small snacks like pieces of toast and crackers that 
she can eat with her fingers.
folic acid/folate: A vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects such 
as spina bifida.

rubbing or patting his back.

APPENDIX B  Glossary      423
gas (drug): A mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen that can be inhaled 
during labor for pain relief. Gas is making a comeback in the United 
States for pain relief.
gastroenteritis: Infection of the gastrointestinal tract that can be 
caused by bacteria from infected water, poor hygiene, or bad food.
gestation: Another word for the time your baby spends in the womb. 
You’ll hear your healthcare provider say things like “30 weeks gestation,” 
which means 30 weeks in the womb.
gestational diabetes: A form of diabetes that can be contracted during 
pregnancy. Your midwife, obstetrician, or family doctor will be on the 
lookout for it with tests throughout the pregnancy.

Depending on the brand, it often has fennel, dill, and sodium bicarbon-
ate in it.
group B strep: A life-threatening bacterial infection in newborn babies.
HCG: Also known as human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone made by 
the embryo to ensure its survival. Most pregnancy tests look for the 
presence of HCG.
home birth: Your partner labors and gives birth at home rather than in 
a delivery suite at a hospital.
hospice: A palliative care facility, where people who are in the final

before getting pregnant is the date that the length of the pregnancy is 
calculated by. So even though you may have conceived your baby on the 
15th day after your partner’s period, your baby is already considered 
two weeks along or at two weeks gestation.
latent phase: The first phase of the first stage of labor, when the cervix 
is starting to dilate. Contractions shouldn’t be too painful and can be 
managed with natural techniques such as heat packs and moving

About the Authors
Sharon Perkins, RN, has been a registered nurse, mostly in 
maternal-child health, for 30 years, a mother to five children for 
much longer, and a grandmother of three for the 14 best years 
of her life. Sharon has been proud to be a For Dummies writer for 
almost the same length of time, writing many For Dummies books, 
including Dad’s Guide to Pregnancy For Dummies, Breastfeeding For 
Dummies, and Infertility For Dummies.
Stefan Korn is a New Zealand–based Internet entrepreneur. He is 
passionate about e-commerce and the web, and in general loves 
getting involved in new businesses. His wife, Raquel, gave birth 
to their son, Noah, in May 2007, and the experience of ­becoming 
a father, as well as the challenges of looking after Noah, prompted 
him to join DIYFather.com. Stefan has a PhD in artificial intel-
ligence and an MBA in international business. Before becom-
ing an entrepreneur, Stefan held senior management roles for 
large international corporations in the IT, telecommunication, 
and hospitality sectors. In addition to DIYFather, Stefan runs an 
investment company for online startups, WebFund. Stefan is also 
actively engaged in community projects and enjoys tutoring for 
Wellington Community Education.
Scott Lancaster is the founder of DIYFather.com. He is married 
to Renee, who gave birth to their daughter, Pyper, in July 2007. 
After discovering what little parenting information was available 
for fathers, Scott approached the other two directors, who helped 
him build DIYFather. Scott looked after Pyper full-time for the 
first two years of her life and experienced being a stay-at-home 
dad (SAHD). Scott has an applied science degree with a major in 
agriculture and comes from a farming background.
Eric Mooij is married to Andrea, who welcomed baby Ava into the 
world in April 2008. Eric is also father to Nastassja, ­Christian, 
and Amber. Although he is not living with his three older chil-
dren, Eric has regular contact with them and supports them in 
every way possible. Eric is keen to make a stand for separated 
families. Coming from a broken family himself and having relived 
this experience with his first three children, he works hard to be 
a positive role model. Outside of DIYFather.com, Eric works in IT 
and project management.

Dedication
Sharon: This book is dedicated to all dads, everywhere, including 
my son Matt and son-in law Matt, two of the best dads I know. 
And of course, my own dad, who was a product of his times and 
wouldn’t have changed a diaper if his life depended on it.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Sharon: Lots of people help create a book, whether they know 
it or not. Obviously, editors like senior acquisitions editor Tracy 
Boggier, project manager Michelle Hacker, development edi-
tor Georgette Beatty, copy editor Christy Pingleton, technical 
reviewer Anne McCartney, art coordinator Alicia South, and other 
behind-the-scenes people at Wiley know the part they played.
But every dad I know has contributed by planting ideas in my head 
about what a dad can and should be. Just watching dads at the 
grocery store, in church, or at the park has allowed me to observe 
great dads in action and steal their ideas for ways dads can spend 
time with their kids.
Last but not least, I thank Jackie Thompson, who got me into this 
whole Dummies thing to begin with.
