Preface
In keeping with the objectives of the previous editions, the third edi-
tion is intended to provide broad coverage of satellite communications
systems, while maintaining sufficient depth to lay the foundations for
more advanced studies. Mathematics is used as a tool to illustrate
physical situations and obtain quantitative results, but lengthy math-
ematical derivations are avoided. Numerical problems and examples
can be worked out using a good calculator or any of the excellent math-
ematical computer packages readily available. Mathcad™ is an excel-
lent tool for this purpose and is used in many of the text examples. The
basic Mathcad notation and operations are explained in Appendix H.
In calculating satellite link performance, extensive use is made of
decibels and related units. The reader who is not familiar with some of
the more specialized of these units will find them explained in
Appendix G.
The main additions to the third edition relate to digital satellite ser-
vices. These have expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of Direct
Broadcast Satellite Services (mainly television), and the Internet; new
chapters have been introduced on these topics. Error detection and cor-
rection is an essential feature of digital transmission, and a separate
chapter is given to this topic as well. The section on code-division mul-
tiple access, another digital transmission method, has been expanded.
As in the previous editions, the basic ideas of orbital mechanics are
covered in Chap. 2. However, because of the unique position and
requirements of the geostationary orbit, this subject has been present-
ed in a chapter of its own. Use of non-geostationary satellites has
increased significantly, and some of the newer systems utilizing low
earth orbits (LEOs) and medium earth orbits (MEOs), as proposed for
Internet use, are described. Iridium, a 66 LEO system that had been
designed to provide mobile communications services on a global scale,
declared bankruptcy in 2000 and the service was discontinued. For

this reason, the description of Iridium was not carried through into the
new edition. In December 2000 a new company, Iridium Satellite LLC.,
was formed. Details of the company and the services offered or pro-
posed will be found at http://www.iridium.com/. Considerable use has
been made of the World Wide Web in updating the previous edition,
and the web sites are referenced in the text. Listings of artificial satel-
lites, previously appended in tabular form, can now be found at the
web sites referenced in Appendix D; these listings have the advantage
of being kept current.
Much of the information in a book of this nature has to be obtained
from companies, professional organizations, and government depart-
ments. These sources are acknowledged in the text, and the author
would like to thank the personnel who responded to his requests for
information. Thanks go to the students at Lakehead University who
suggested improvements and provided corrections to the drafts used
in classroom teaching; to Dr. Henry Driver of Computer Sciences
Corporation who sent in comprehensive corrections and references 
for the calculation of geodetic position. The author welcomes 
readers’ comments and suggestions and he can be reached by email at
dennis.roddy@lakeheadu.ca. Thanks also go to Carol Levine for the
friendly way in which she kept the editorial process on schedule, and
to Steve Chapman, the sponsoring editor, for providing the impetus to
work on the third edition.

Overview of Satellite Systems
1.1
Introduction
The use of satellites in communications systems is very much a fact of
everyday life, as is evidenced by the many homes which are equipped
with antennas, or “dishes,” used for reception of satellite television.
What may not be so well known is that satellites form an essential
part of telecommunications systems worldwide, carrying large
amounts of data and telephone traffic in addition to television signals.
Satellites offer a number of features not readily available with other
means of communications. Because very large areas of the earth are
visible from a satellite, the satellite can form the star point of a com-
munications net linking together many users simultaneously, users
who may be widely separated geographically. The same feature enables
satellites to provide communications links to remote communities in
sparsely populated areas which are difficult to access by other means.
Of course, satellite signals ignore political boundaries as well as geo-
graphic ones, which may or may not be a desirable feature.
To give some idea of cost, the construction and launch costs of the
Canadian Anik-E1 satellite (in 1994 Canadian dollars) were $281.2
million, and the Anik-E2, $290.5 million. The combined launch insur-
ance for both satellites was $95.5 million. A feature of any satellite sys-
tem is that the cost is distance insensitive, meaning that it costs about
the same to provide a satellite communications link over a short dis-
tance as it does over a large distance. Thus a satellite communications
system is economical only where the system is in continuous use and
the costs can be reasonably spread over a large number of users.
Satellites are also used for remote sensing, examples being the
detection of water pollution and the monitoring and reporting of
weather conditions. Some of these remote sensing satellites also form

a vital link in search and rescue operations for downed aircraft and
the like.
A good overview of the role of satellites is given by Pritchard (1984)
and Brown (1981). To provide a general overview of satellite systems
here, three different types of applications are briefly described in this
chapter: (1) the largest international system, Intelsat, (2) the domestic
satellite system in the United States, Domsat, and (3) U.S. National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of
polar orbiting satellites used for environmental monitoring and search
and rescue.
1.2
Frequency Allocations for Satellite
Services
Allocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process
which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried
out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union.
To facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions:
Region 1: Europe, Africa, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and
Mongolia
Region 2: North and South America and Greenland
Region 3: Asia (excluding region 1 areas), Australia, and the south-
west Pacific
Within these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satel-
lite services, although a given service may be allocated different fre-
quency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by
satellites are
Fixed satellite service (FSS)
Broadcasting satellite service (BSS)
Mobile satellite services
Navigational satellite services
Meteorological satellite services
There are many subdivisions within these broad classifications; for
example, the fixed satellite service provides links for existing tele-
phone networks as well as for transmitting television signals to cable
companies for distribution over cable systems. Broadcasting satellite
services are intended mainly for direct broadcast to the home, some-

vices would include land mobile, maritime mobile, and aeronautical
mobile. Navigational satellite services include global positioning sys-
tems, and satellites intended for the meterorological services often
provide a search and rescue service.
Table 1.1 lists the frequency band designations in common use for
satellite services. The Ku band signifies the band under the K band,
and the Ka band is the band above the K band. The Ku band is the one
used at present for direct broadcast satellites, and it is also used for
certain fixed satellite services. The C band is used for fixed satellite
services, and no direct broadcast services are allowed in this band. The
VHF band is used for certain mobile and navigational services and for
data transfer from weather satellites. The L band is used for mobile
satellite services and navigation systems. For the fixed satellite ser-
vice in the C band, the most widely used subrange is approximately 
4 to 6 GHz. The higher frequency is nearly always used for the uplink
to the satellite, for reasons which will be explained later, and common
practice is to denote the C band by 6/4 GHz, giving the uplink fre-
quency first. For the direct broadcast service in the Ku band, the most
widely used range is approximately 12 to 14 GHz, which is denoted by
14/12 GHz. Although frequency assignments are made much more pre-
cisely, and they may lie somewhat outside the values quoted here (an
example of assigned frequencies in the Ku band is 14,030 and 11,
730 MHz), the approximate values stated above are quite satisfactory
for use in calculations involving frequency, as will be shown later in
the text.
Care must be exercised when using published references to fre-
quency bands because the designations have developed somewhat dif-
ferently for radar and communications applications; in addition, not
all countries use the same designations. The official ITU frequency

INTELSAT
INTELSAT stands for International Telecommunications Satellite.
The organization was created in 1964 and currently has over 140
member countries and more than 40 investing entities (see
http://www.intelsat.com/ for more details). Starting with the Early
Bird satellite in 1965, a succession of satellites has been launched at
intervals of a few years. Figure 1.1 illustrates the evolution of some of
the INTELSAT satellites. As the figure shows, the capacity, in terms 
of number of voice channels, increased dramatically with each suc-
ceeding launch, as well as the design lifetime. These satellites are in
geostationary orbit, meaning that they appear to be stationary in rela-
tion to the earth. The geostationary orbit is the topic of Chap. 3. At this
point it may be noted that geostationary satellites orbit in the earth’s
equatorial plane and that their position is specified by their longitude.
For international traffic, INTELSAT covers three main regions, the
Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR), the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and 
the Pacific Ocean Region (POR). For each region, the satellites are
positioned in geostationary orbit above the particular ocean, where
they provide a transoceanic telecommunications route. The coverage
areas for INTELSAT VI are shown in Fig. 1.2. Traffic in the AOR is
about three times that in the IOR and about twice that in the IOR and
POR combined. Thus the system design is tailored mainly around AOR
requirements (Thompson and Johnston, 1983). As of May 1999, there
were three INTELSAT VI satellites in service in the AOR and two in
service in the IOR.

The INTELSAT VII-VII/A series was launched over a period from
October 1993 to June 1996. The construction is similar to that for the
V and VA/VB series shown in Fig. 1.1 in that the VII series has solar
sails rather than a cylindrical body. This type of construction is
described more fully in Chap. 7. The VII series was planned for service
in the POR and also for some of the less demanding services in the
AOR. The antenna beam coverage is appropriate for that of the POR.
Figure 1.3 shows the antenna beam footprints for the C-band hemi-
spheric coverage and zone coverage, as well as the spot beam coverage
possible with the Ku-band antennas (Lilly, 1990; Sachdev et al., 1990).
When used in the AOR, the VII series satellite is inverted north for
south (Lilly, 1990), minor adjustments then being needed only to opti-
mize the antenna patterns for this region. The lifetime of these satel-

lites ranges from 10 to 15 years depending on the launch vehicle.
Recent figures from the INTELSAT Web site give the capacity for the
INTELSAT VII as 18,000 two-way telephone circuits and 3 TV chan-
nels; up to 90,000 two-way telephone circuits can be achieved with the
use of “digital circuit multiplication.” The INTELSAT VII/A has a
capacity of 22,500 two-way telephone circuits and 3 TV channels; up to
112,500 two-way telephone circuits can be achieved with the use of
digital circuit multiplication. As of May 1999, four satellites were in
service over the AOR, one in the IOR, and two in the POR.
The INTELSAT VIII-VII/A series of satellites was launched over a
period February 1997 to June 1998. Satellites in this series have sim-
ilar capacity as the VII/A series, and the lifetime is 14 to 17 years.
It is standard practice to have a spare satellite in orbit on high-relia-
bility routes (which can carry preemptible traffic) and to have a ground

spare in case of launch failure. Thus the cost for large international
schemes can be high; for example, series IX, described below, represents
a total investment of approximately $1 billion.
The INTELSAT IX satellites are the latest in the series (Table 1.3).
They will provide a much wider range of services than previously and
promise such services as Internet, direct-to-home (DTH) TV, tele-
medicine, tele-education, and interactive video and multimedia.
In addition to providing transoceanic routes, the INTELSAT satel-
lites are also used for domestic services within any given country and
regional services between countries. Two such services are Vista for
telephone and Intelnet for data exchange. Figure 1.4 shows typical
Vista applications.
1.4
U.S. Domsats
Domsat is an abbreviation for domestic satellite. Domestic satellites
are used to provide various telecommunications services, such as
voice, data, and video transmissions, within a country. In the United
States, all domsats are situated in geostationary orbit. As is well
known, they make available a wide selection of TV channels for the
home entertainment market, in addition to carrying a large amount of
commercial telecommunications traffic.
U.S. Domsats which provide a direct-to-home television service can
be classified broadly as high power, medium power, and low power
(Reinhart, 1990). The defining characteristics of these categories are
shown in Table 1.4.
The main distinguishing feature of these categories is the equivalent
isotropic radiated power (EIRP). This is explained in more detail in
Chap. 12, but for present purposes it should be noted that the upper 
limit of EIRP is 60 dBW for the high-power category and 37 dBW for the
low-power category, a difference of 23 dB. This represents an increase in
received power of 102.3 or about 200:1 in the high-power category, which
allows much smaller antennas to be used with the receiver. As noted in

the table, the primary purpose of satellites in the high-power category
is to provide a DBS service. In the medium-power category, the primary
purpose is point-to-point services, but space may be leased on these
satellites for the provision of DBS services. In the low-power category,
no official DBS services are provided. However, it was quickly discov-
ered by home experimenters that a wide range of radio and TV pro-
gramming could be received on this band, and it is now considered to
provide a de facto DBS service, witness to which is the large number of
TV receive-only (TVRO) dishes which have appeared in the yards and
on the rooftops of homes in North America. TVRO reception of C-band
signals in the home is prohibited in many other parts of the world, part-
ly for aesthetic reasons because of the comparatively large dishes used,
and partly for commercial reasons. Many North American C-band TV
broadcasts are now encrypted, or scrambled, to prevent unauthorized
access, although this also seems to be spawning a new underground
industry in descramblers.
As shown in Table 1.4, true DBS service takes place in the Ku band.
Figure 1.5 shows the components of a direct broadcasting satellite sys-
tem (Government of Canada, 1983). The television signal may be
relayed over a terrestrial link to the uplink station. This transmits a
very narrowbeam signal to the satellite in the 14-GHz band. The satel-
lite retransmits the television signal in a wide beam in the 12-GHz
frequency band. Individual receivers within the beam coverage area
will receive the satellite signal.
Table 1.5 shows the orbital assignments for domestic fixed satellites
for the United States (FCC, 1996). These satellites are in geostation-
ary orbit, which is discussed further in Chap. 3. Table 1.6 shows the

U.S. Ka-band assignments. Broadband services such as Internet (see
Chap. 15) can operate at Ka-band frequencies. In 1983, the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a policy objec-
tive setting 2° as the minimum obital spacing for satellites operating
in the 6/4-GHz band and 1.5° for those operating in the 14/12-GHz
band (FCC, 1983). It is clear that interference between satellite cir-
cuits is likely to increase as satellites are positioned closer together.
These spacings represent the minimum presently achievable in each
band at acceptable interference levels. In fact, it seems likely that in
some cases home satellite receivers in the 6/4-GHz band may be sub-
ject to excessive interference where 2° spacing is employed.

Polar Orbiting Satellites
Polar orbiting satellites orbit the earth in such a way as to cover the
north and south polar regions. (Note that the term polar orbiting does
not mean that the satellite orbits around one or the other of the poles).
Figure 1.6 shows a polar orbit in relation to the geostationary orbit.
Whereas there is only one geostationary orbit, there are, in theory, an

infinite number of polar orbits. The U.S. experience with weather
satellites has led to the use of relatively low orbits, ranging in altitude
between 800 and 900 km, compared with 36,000 km for the geosta-
tionary orbit.
In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) operates a weather satellite system. Their Web
page can be found at http://www.noaa.gov/. The system uses both geo-
stationary satellites, referred to as geostationary operational environ-
mental satellites (GOES), and polar operational environmental satellites
(POES). There are two of these polar satellites in orbit at any one time.
The orbits are circular, passing close to the poles, and they are sun syn-
chronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time
each day. The morning orbit, at an altitude of 830 km, crosses the equa-
tor going from south to north at 7:30 A.M. each day, and the afternoon
orbit, at an altitude of 870 km, at 1:40 P.M. The polar orbiters are able to
track weather conditions over the entire earth and provide a wide range
of data, including visible and infrared radiometer data for imaging pur-
poses, radiation measurements, and temperature profiles. They carry
ultraviolet sensors that measure ozone levels, and they can monitor the
ozone hole over Antarctica.
The polar orbiters carry a NOAA letter designation before launch,
which is changed to a numeric designation once the satellite achieves
orbit. NOAA-J, launched in December 1994, became NOAA-14 in oper-
ation. The new series, referred to as the KLM satellites, carries much
improved instrumentation. Some details are shown in Table 1.7. The

Argos data collection system (DCS) collects environmental data
radioed up from automatic data collection platforms on land, on ocean
buoys, and aboard free-floating balloons. The satellites process these
data and retransmit them to ground stations.
The NOAA satellites also participate in satellite search and rescue
(SAR) operations, known generally as Cospas-Sarsat, where Cospas
refers to the payload carried by participating Russian satellites and
Sarsat to the payloads carried by the NOAA satellites. Sarsat-6 is car-
ried by NOAA-14, and Sarsat-7 is carried by NOAA-15. The projected
payloads Sarsat-8 to Sarsat-10 will be carried by NOAA-L to NOAA-N.
The Cospas-Sarsat Web page is at http://www.cospas-sarsat.org/. As of
January 2000, there were 32 countries formally associated with Cospas-
Sarsat. Originally, the system was designed to operate only with satel-
lites in low earth orbits (LEOs), this part of the search and rescue
system being known as LEOSAR. Later, the system was complemented
with geostationary satellites, this component being known as GEOSAR.
Figure 1.7 shows the combined LEOSAR-GEOSAR system.
The nominal space segment of LEOSAR consists of four satellites,
although as of January 2000 there were seven in total, three Cospas and
four Sarsat. In operation, the satellite receives a signal from an emer-
gency beacon set off automatically at the distress site. The beacon trans-
mits in the VHF/UHF range, at a precisely controlled frequency. The
satellite moves at some velocity relative to the beacon, and this results
in a Doppler shift in frequency received at the satellite. As the satellite
approaches the beacon, the received frequency appears to be higher

received frequency appears to be lower than the transmitted value.

varies for different passes. In all cases, the received frequency goes from

being higher to being lower than the transmitted value as the satellite
approaches and then recedes from the beacon. The longest record and 
the greatest change in frequency are obtained if the satellite passes 
over the site, as shown for pass no. 2. This is so because the satellite is
visible for the longest period during this pass. Knowing the orbital para-
meters for the satellite, the beacon frequency, and the Doppler shift for
any one pass, the distance of the beacon relative to the projection of the
orbit on the earth can be determined. However, whether the beacon is
east or west of the orbit cannot be determined easily from a single pass.
For two successive passes, the effect of the earth’s rotation on the
Doppler shift can be estimated more accurately, and from this it can be
determined whether the beacon is approaching or receding from the
orbital path. In this way, the ambiguity in east-west positioning is
resolved. Figure 1.9 illustrates the Doppler shifts for successive passes.
The satellite must of course get the information back to an earth 
station so that the search and rescue operation can be completed, 
successfully one hopes. The Sarsat communicates on a downlink fre-
quency of 1544.5 MHz to one of several local user terminals (LUTs)
established at various locations throughout the world.

TLFeBOOK

In the original Cospas-Sarsat system, the signal from the emer-
gency locator transmitters (ELTs) was at a frequency of 121.5 MHz. It
was found that over 98 percent of the alerts at this frequency were
false, often being caused by interfering signals from other services
and by inappropriate handling of the equipment. The 121.5-MHz sys-
tem relies entirely on the Doppler shift, and the carrier does not 
carry any identification information. The power is low, typically a few
tenths of a watt, which limits locational accuracy to about 10 to 20
km. There are no signal storage facilities aboard the satellites for the
121.5-MHz signals, which therefore requires that the distress site
(the ELT) and the local user terminal (LUT) must be visible simulta-
neously from the satellite. Because of these limitations, the 121.5-
MHz beacons are being phased out. Cospas-13, planned for launch in
2006, and Sarsat-14, planned for launch from 2009, will not carry
121.5-MHz beacons. However, all Cospas-Sarsat satellites launched
prior to these will carry the 121.5-MHz processors. (Recall that
Sarsat-7 is NOAA-15, Sarsat-8 is NOAA-L, Sarsat-9 is NOAA-M, 
and Sarsat-10 is NOAA-N).
The status of the 121.5-MHz LEOSAR system as of January 2000
consisted of repeaters on seven polar orbiters, 35 ground receiving sta-
tions (referred to as LEOSAR local user terminals, or LEOLUTs), and
20 mission control centers (MCCs). The MCC alerts the rescue coordi-
nation center (RCC) nearest the location where the distress signal orig-
inated, and the RCC takes the appropriate action to effect a rescue.
There are about 600,000 distress beacons, carried mostly on aircraft
and small vessels.
Newer beacons operating at a frequency of 406 MHz are being intro-
duced. The power has been increased to 5 Watts, which should permit
locational accuracy to 3 to 5 km (Scales and Swanson, 1984). These are
known as emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs).
Units for personnel use are also available, known as personal locator
beacons (PLBs). The 406-MHz carrier is modulated with information
such as an identifying code, the last known position, and the nature of
the emergency. The satellite has the equipment for storing and for-
warding the information from a continuous memory dump, providing
complete worldwide coverage with 100 percent availability. The polar
orbiters, however, do not provide continuous coverage. The mean time
between a distress alert being sent and the appropriate search and
rescue coordination center being notified is estimated at 27 min satel-
lite storage time plus 44 min waiting time for a total delay of 71 min
(Cospas-Sarsat, 1994b).
The nominal frequency is 406 MHz, and originally, a frequency of
406.025 MHz was used. Because of potential conflict with the
18
Chapter One
TLFeBOOK

GEOSTAR system, the frequency is being moved to 406.028 MHz.
Beacons submitted for type approval after January 1, 2000 may oper-
ate at the new frequency, and after January 1, 2001, all beacons sub-
mitted for type approval must operate at a frequency of 406.028 MHz.
However, beacon types approved before the January 2001 date and still
in production may continue to operate at 406.025 MHz. The power of
the 406 MHz beacons is 5 watts.
As shown in Figure 1.7, the overall system incorporates GEOSAR
satellites. Because these are stationary, there is no Doppler shift.
However, the 406-MHz beacons for the GEOSTAR component carry posi-
tional information obtained from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS)
system. The GPS system is described in Chap. 17. It should be noted that
the GEOSAR system does not provide coverage of the polar regions.
As mentioned previously, the NOAA satellites are placed in a low
earth orbit typified by the NOAA-J satellite. The NOAA-J satellite
will orbit the earth in approximately 102.12 min. The orbit is
arranged to rotate eastward at a rate of 0.9856°/day, to make it sun-
synchronous. Sun-synchronous orbits are discussed more fully in
Chap. 2, but very briefly, in a sun-synchronous orbit the satellite
crosses the same spot on the earth at the same local time each day.
One advantage of a sun-synchronous orbit is that the same area of the
earth can be viewed under approximately the same lighting condi-
tions each day. By definition, an orbital pass from south to north is
referred to as an ascending pass, and from north to south, as a
descending pass. The NOAA-J orbit crosses the equator at about 1:40
P.M. local solar time on its ascending pass and at about 1:40 A.M. local
solar time on its descending pass.
Because of the eastward rotation of the satellite orbit, the earth
rotates approximately 359° relative to it in 24 h of mean solar time
(ordinary clock time), and therefore, in 102.12 min the earth will have
rotated about 25.59° relative to the orbit. The satellite “footprint” is dis-
placed each time by this amount, as shown in Fig. 1.7. At the equator,
25.59° corresponds to a distance of about 2848 km. The width of ground
seen by the satellite sensors is about 5000 km, which means that some
overlap occurs between passes. The overlap is greatest at the poles.

Introduction
Satellites (spacecraft) which orbit the earth follow the same laws that
govern the motion of the planets around the sun. From early times
much has been learned about planetary motion through careful obser-
vations. From these observations Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was
able to derive empirically three laws describing planetary motion.
Later, in 1665, Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was able to derive
Kepler’s laws from his own laws of mechanics and develop the theory
of gravitation [for very readable accounts of much of the work of these
two great men, see Arons (1965) and Bate et al. (1971)].
Kepler’s laws apply quite generally to any two bodies in space which
interact through gravitation. The more massive of the two bodies is
referred to as the primary, the other, the secondary, or satellite.
2.2
Kepler’s First Law
Kepler’s first law states that the path followed by a satellite around
the primary will be an ellipse. An ellipse has two focal points shown as
F1 and F2 in Fig. 2.1. The center of mass of the two-body system,
termed the barycenter, is always centered on one of the foci. In our spe-
cific case, because of the enormous difference between the masses of
the earth and the satellite, the center of mass coincides with the cen-
ter of the earth, which is therefore always at one of the foci.
The semimajor axis of the ellipse is denoted by a, and the semimi-
nor axis, by b. The eccentricity e is given by

The eccentricity and the semimajor axis are two of the orbital para-
meters specified for satellites (spacecraft) orbiting the earth. For an
elliptical orbit, 0  e  1. When e  0, the orbit becomes circular. The
geometrical significance of eccentricity, along with some of the other
geometrical properties of the ellipse, is developed in App. B.
2.3
Kepler’s Second Law
Kepler’s second law states that, for equal time intervals, a satellite
will sweep out equal areas in its orbital plane, focused at the
barycenter. Referring to Fig. 2.2, assuming the satellite travels dis-
tances S1 and S2 meters in 1 s, then the areas A1 and A2 will be
equal. The average velocity in each case is S1 and S2 meters per sec-
ond, and because of the equal area law, it follows that the velocity at
S2 is less than that at S1. An important consequence of this is that
the satellite takes longer to travel a given distance when it is farther

away from earth. Use is made of this property to increase the length
of time a satellite can be seen from particular geographic regions of
the earth.
2.4
Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s third law states that the square of the periodic time of orbit
is proportional to the cube of the mean distance between the two bod-
ies. The mean distance is equal to the semimajor axis a. For the arti-
ficial satellites orbiting the earth, Kepler’s third law can be written in
the form
a3 
(2.2)
where n is the mean motion of the satellite in radians per second and
 is the earth’s geocentric gravitational constant. With a in meters, its
value is (see Wertz, 1984, Table L3).
  3.986005  1014 m3/sec2
(2.3)
Equation (2.2) applies only to the ideal situation of a satellite orbit-
ing a perfectly spherical earth of uniform mass, with no perturbing
forces acting, such as atmospheric drag. Later, in Sec. 2.8, the effects
of the earth’s oblateness and atmospheric drag will be taken into
account.
With n in radians per second, the orbital period in seconds is giv-
en by
P 
(2.4)
The importance of Kepler’s third law is that it shows there is a fixed
relationship between period and size. One very important orbit in par-
ticular, known as the geostationary orbit, is determined by the rota-
tional period of the earth and is described in Chap. 3. In anticipation
of this, the approximate radius of the geostationary orbit is deter-
mined in the following example.

Definitions of Terms for Earth-Orbiting
Satellites
As mentioned previously, Kepler’s laws apply in general to satellite
motion around a primary body. For the particular case of earth-orbit-
ing satellites, certain terms are used to describe the position of the
orbit with respect to the earth.
Apogee
The point farthest from earth. Apogee height is shown as ha in Fig. 2.3.
Perigee
The point of closest approach to earth. The perigee height is shown
as hp in Fig. 2.3.
Line of apsides
The line joining the perigee and apogee through the center
of the earth.
Ascending node
The point where the orbit crosses the equatorial plane
going from south to north.
Descending node
The point where the orbit crosses the equatorial plane
going from north to south.
Line of nodes
The line joining the ascending and descending nodes through
the center of the earth.
Inclination
The angle between the orbital plane and the earth’s equatori-
al plane. It is measured at the ascending node from the equator to the
orbit, going from east to north. The inclination is shown as i in Fig. 2.3. It
will be seen that the greatest latitude, north or south, is equal to the incli-
nation.

Prograde orbit
An orbit in which the satellite moves in the same direction as the
earth’s rotation, as shown in Fig. 2.4. The prograde orbit is also known as a direct
orbit. The inclination of a prograde orbit always lies between 0 and 90°. Most
satellites are launched in a prograde orbit because the earth’s rotational velocity
provides part of the orbital velocity with a consequent saving in launch energy.
Retrograde orbit
An orbit in which the satellite moves in a direction counter
to the earth’s rotation, as shown in Fig. 2.4. The inclination of a retrograde
orbit always lies between 90 and 180°.
Argument of perigee
The angle from ascending node to perigee, measured in
the orbital plane at the earth’s center, in the direction of satellite motion. The
argument of perigee is shown as 
 in Fig. 2.5.
Right ascension of the ascending node
To define completely the position
of the orbit in space, the position of the ascending node is specified.
However, because the earth spins, while the orbital plane remains station-
ary (slow drifts which do occur are discussed later), the longitude of the
ascending node is not fixed, and it cannot be used as an absolute reference.
For the practical determination of an orbit, the longitude and time of cross-
ing of the ascending node are frequently used. However, for an absolute
measurement, a fixed reference in space is required. The reference chosen
is the first point of Aries, otherwise known as the vernal, or spring, equinox.

The vernal equinox occurs when the sun crosses the equator going from
south to north, and an imaginary line drawn from this equatorial crossing
through the center of the sun points to the first point of Aries (symbol ).
This is the line of Aries. The right ascension of the ascending node is then
the angle measured eastward, in the equatorial plane, from the  line to the
ascending node, shown as  in Fig. 2.5.

Mean anomaly
Mean anomaly M gives an average value of the angular posi-
tion of the satellite with reference to the perigee. For a circular orbit, M gives
the angular position of the satellite in the orbit. For elliptical orbit, the posi-
tion is much more difficult to calculate, and M is used as an intermediate step
in the calculation as described in Sec. 2.9.5.
True anomaly
The true anomaly is the angle from perigee to the satellite
position, measured at the earth’s center. This gives the true angular position
of the satellite in the orbit as a function of time. A method of determining the
true anomaly is described in Sec. 2.9.5.
2.6
Orbital Elements
Earth-orbiting artificial satellites are defined by six orbital elements
referred to as the keplerian element set. Two of these, the semimajor
axis a and the eccentricity e described in Sec. 2.2, give the shape of the
ellipse. A third, the mean anomaly M0, gives the position of the satel-
lite in its orbit at a reference time known as the epoch. A fourth, the
argument of perigee 
, gives the rotation of the orbit’s perigee point
relative to the orbit’s line of nodes in the earth’s equatorial plane. The
remaining two elements, the inclination i and the right ascension of
the ascending node , relate the orbital plane’s position to the earth.
These four elements are described in Sec. 2.5.
Because the equatorial bulge causes slow variations in 
 and , and
because other perturbing forces may alter the orbital elements slight-
ly, the values are specified for the reference time or epoch, and thus the
epoch also must be specified.
Appendix C lists the two-line elements provided to users by the U.S.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The two-line
elements may be downloaded from the Web site shown in Fig. 2.6.

Orbit Perturbations
The type of orbit described so far, referred to as a keplerian orbit, is
elliptical for the special case of an artificial satellite orbiting the
earth. However, the keplerian orbit is ideal in the sense that it
assumes that the earth is a uniform spherical mass and that the
only force acting is the centrifugal force resulting from satellite
motion balancing the gravitational pull of the earth. In practice, oth-
er forces which can be significant are the gravitational forces of the
sun and the moon and atmospheric drag. The gravitational pulls of
sun and moon have negligible effect on low-orbiting satellites, but
they do affect satellites in the geostationary orbit as described in
Sec. 3.5. Atmospheric drag, on the other hand, has negligible effect
on geostationary satellites but does affect low-orbiting earth satel-
lites below about 1000 km.
2.8.1
Effects of a nonspherical earth
For a spherical earth of uniform mass, Kepler’s third law (Eq. 2.2)
gives the nominal mean motion n0 as

(2.7)
The 0 subscript is included as a reminder that this result applies
for a perfectly spherical earth of uniform mass. However, it is known
that the earth is not perfectly spherical, there being an equatorial
bulge and a flattening at the poles, a shape described as an oblate
spheroid. When the earth’s oblateness is taken into account, the

ness has negligible effect on the semimajor axis a, and if a is known, the
mean motion is readily calculated. The orbital period taking into account
the earth’s oblateness is termed the anomalistic period (e.g., from perigee
to perigee). The mean motion specified in the NASA bulletins is the reci-
procal of the anomalistic period. The anomalistic period is

where n is in radians per second.
If the known quantity is n (as is given in the NASA bulletins, for
example), one can solve Eq. (2.8) for a, keeping in mind that n0 is also
a function of a. Equation (2.8) may be solved for a by finding the root
of the following equation:

The oblateness of the earth also produces two rotations of the
orbital plane. The first of these, known as regression of the nodes, is
where the nodes appear to slide along the equator. In effect, the line
of nodes, which is in the equatorial plane, rotates about the center of
the earth. Thus , the right ascension of the ascending node, shifts its
position.
If the orbit is prograde (see Fig. 2.4), the nodes slide westward, and
if retrograde, they slide eastward. As seen from the ascending node, a
satellite in prograde orbit moves eastward, and in a retrograde orbit,
westward. The nodes therefore move in a direction opposite to the
direction of satellite motion, hence the term regression of the nodes.
For a polar orbit (i  90°), the regression is zero.
The second effect is rotation of apsides in the orbital plane,
described below. Both effects depend on the mean motion n, the semi-
major axis a, and the eccentricity e. These factors can be grouped into
one factor K given by
K 
(2.11)
K will have the same units as n. Thus, with n in rad / day, K will be
in rad / day, and with n in °/day, K will be in °/day. An approximate
expression for the rate of change of  with respect to time is (Wertz,
1984)
 K cos i
(2.12)
where i is the inclination.
The rate of regression of the nodes will have the same units as n.
When the rate of change given by Eq. (2.12) is negative, the regres-
sion is westward, and when the rate is positive, the regression is east-
ward. It will be seen, therefore, that for eastward regression, i must be

greater than 90°, or the orbit must be retrograde. It is possible to
choose values of a, e, and i such that the rate of rotation is 0.9856°/day
eastward. Such an orbit is said to be sun-synchronous and is described
further in Sec. 2.10.
In the other major effect produced by the equatorial bulge, rota-
tion of the line of apsides in the orbital plane, the argument of
perigee changes with time, in effect, the rate of change being given
by (Wertz, 1984)
 K (2  2.5 sin2 i)
(2.13)
Again, the units for the rate of rotation of the line of apsides will be the
same as those for n.
When the inclination i is equal to 63.435°, the term within the
parentheses is equal to zero, and hence no rotation takes place. Use is
made of this fact in the orbit chosen for the Russian Molniya satellites
(see Probs. 2.23 and 2.24).
Denoting the epoch time by t0, the right ascension of the ascending
node by 0, and the argument of perigee by 
0 at epoch gives the new
values for  and 
 at time t as

Keep in mind that the orbit is not a physical entity, and it is the
forces resulting from an oblate earth which act on the satellite to pro-
duce the changes in the orbital parameters. Thus, rather than follow a
closed elliptical path in a fixed plane, the satellite drifts as a result of
the regression of the nodes, and the latitude of the point of closest
approach (the perigee) changes as a result of the rotation of the line of
apsides. With this in mind, it is permissible to visualize the satellite as
following a closed elliptical orbit but with the orbit itself moving rela-
tive to the earth as a result of the changes in  and 
. Thus, as stat-
ed above, the period PA is the time required to go around the orbital
path from perigee to perigee, even though the perigee has moved rela-
tive to the earth.
Suppose, for example, that the inclination is 90° so that the regres-
sion of the nodes is zero (from Eq. 2.12), and the rate of rotation of
the line of apsides is K/2 (from Eq. 2.13), and further, imagine the

situation where the perigee at the start of observations is exactly
over the ascending node. One period later the perigee would be at an
angle KPA/2 relative to the ascending node or, in other words, would
be south of the equator. The time between crossings at the ascending
node would be PA (1  K/2n), which would be the period observed from
the earth. Recall that K will have the same units as n, e.g., radians
per second.

In addition to the equatorial bulge, the earth is not perfectly circu-
lar in the equatorial plane; it has a small eccentricity of the order of
105. This is referred to as the equatorial ellipticity. The effect of the
equatorial ellipticity is to set up a gravity gradient which has a pro-
nounced effect on satellites in geostationary orbit (Sec. 7.4). Very
briefly, a satellite in geostationary orbit ideally should remain fixed
relative to the earth. The gravity gradient resulting from the equator-
ial ellipticity causes the satellites in geostationary orbit to drift to one
of two stable points, which coincide with the minor axis of the equato-
rial ellipse. These two points are separated by 180° on the equator and
are at approximately 75° E longitude and 105° W longitude. Satellites
in service are prevented from drifting to these points through station-
keeping maneuvers, described in Sec. 7.4. Because old, out-of-service
satellites eventually do drift to these points, they are referred to as
“satellite graveyards.”
It may be noted that the effect of equatorial ellipticity is negligible
on most other satellite orbits.
2.8.2
Atmospheric Drag
For near-earth satellites, below about 1000 km, the effects of atmos-
pheric drag are significant. Because the drag is greatest at the perigee,
the drag acts to reduce the velocity at this point, with the result that
the satellite does not reach the same apogee height on successive rev-
olutions. The result is that the semimajor axis and the eccentricity are
both reduced. Drag does not noticeably change the other orbital para-
meters, including perigee height. In the program used for generating
the orbital elements given in the NASA bulletins, a “pseudo-drag”
term is generated which is equal to one-half the rate of change of mean
motion (ADC USAF, 1980). An approximate expression for the change
of major axis is

The mean anomaly is also changed. An approximate expression for
the amount by which it changes is
M 
(t  t0)2
(2.17)
From Table 2.1 it is seen that the first time derivative of the mean
motion is listed in columns 34–43 of line 1 of the NASA bulletin. For
the example shown in Fig. 2.6, this is 0.00000307 rev/day2. Thus the
changes resulting from the drag term will be significant only for long
time intervals and for present purposes will be ignored. For a more
accurate analysis, suitable for long-term predictions, the reader is
referred to ADC USAF (1980).
2.9
Inclined Orbits
A study of the general situation of a satellite in an inclined elliptical
orbit is complicated by the fact that different parameters are referred
to different reference frames. The orbital elements are known with ref-
erence to the plane of the orbit, the position of which is fixed (or slow-
ly varying) in space, while the location of the earth station is usually
given in terms of the local geographic coordinates which rotate with
the earth. Rectangular coordinate systems are generally used in cal-
culations of satellite position and velocity in space, while the earth sta-
tion quantities of interest may be the azimuth and elevation angles
and range. Transformations between coordinate systems are therefore
required.
Here, in order to illustrate the method of calculation for elliptical
inclined orbits, the problem of finding the earth station look angles and
range will be considered. It should be kept in mind that with inclined
orbits the satellites are not geostationary, and therefore, the required
look angles and range will change with time. Detailed and very read-
able treatments of orbital properties in general will be found, for exam-
ple, in Bate et al. (1971) and Wertz (1984). Much of the explanation and
the notation in this section is based on these two references.
Determination of the look angles and range involves the following
quantities and concepts:
1. The orbital elements, as published in the NASA bulletins and
described in Sec. 2.6
2. Various measures of time
3. The perifocal coordinate system, which is based on the orbital plane
4. The geocentric-equatorial coordinate system, which is based on the
earth’s equatorial plane
n0′

Chapter Two
TLFeBOOK

5. The topocentric-horizon coordinate system, which is based on the
observer’s horizon plane
The two major coordinate transformations which are needed are as
follows:
I The satellite position measured in the perifocal system is trans-
formed to the geocentric-horizon system in which the earth’s rota-
tion is measured, thus enabling the satellite position and the earth
station location to be coordinated.
I The satellite-to-earth station position vector is transformed to the
topocentric-horizon system, which enables the look angles and range
to be calculated.
2.9.1
Calendars
A calendar is a timekeeping device in which the year is divided into
months, weeks, and days. Calendar days are units of time based on the
earth’s motion relative to the sun. Of course, it is more convenient to
think of the sun moving relative to the earth. This motion is not uni-
form, and so a fictitious sun, termed the mean sun, is introduced.
The mean sun does move at a uniform speed but otherwise requires
the same time as the real sun to complete one orbit of the earth, this
time being the tropical year. A day measured relative to this mean sun
is termed a mean solar day. Calendar days are mean solar days, and
generally they are just referred to as days.
A tropical year contains 365.2422 days. In order to make the calen-
dar year, also referred to as the civil year, more easily usable, it is nor-
mally divided into 365 days. The extra 0.2422 of a day is significant,
and for example, after 100 years, there would be a discrepancy of 24
days between the calendar year and the tropical year. Julius Caesar
made the first attempt to correct for the discrepancy by introducing
the leap year, in which an extra day is added to February whenever the
year number is divisible by four. This gave the Julian calendar, in
which the civil year was 365.25 days on average, a reasonable approx-
imation to the tropical year.
By the year 1582, an appreciable discrepancy once again existed
between the civil and tropical years. Pope Gregory XIII took matters
in hand by abolishing the days October 5 through October 14, 1582, to
bring the civil and tropical years into line and by placing an addition-
al constraint on the leap year in that years ending in two zeros must
be divisible by 400 to be reckoned as leap years. This dodge was used
to miss out 3 days every 400 years. The resulting calendar is the
Gregorian calendar, which is the one in use today.

Example 2.7
Calculate the average length of the civil year in the
Gregorian calendar.
solution
The nominal number of days in 400 years is 400  365  146,000.
The nominal number of leap years is 400/4  100, but this must be reduced
by 3, and therefore, the number of days in 400 years of the Gregorian cal-
endar is 146,000  100  3  146,097. This gives a yearly average of
146,097/400  365.2425.
In calculations requiring satellite predictions, it is necessary to
determine whether a year is a leap year or not, and the simple rule is:
If the year number ends in two zeros and is divisible by 400, it is a leap
year. Otherwise, if the year number is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
Example 2.8
Determine which of the following years are leap years: (a)
1987, (b) 1988, (c) 2000, (d) 2100.
solution
a) 1987/4  496.75 (therefore, 1987 is not a leap year)
b) 1988/4  497 (therefore, 1988 is a leap year)
(c) 2000/400  5 (therefore, 2000 is a leap year)
(d) 2100/400  5.25 (therefore, 2100 is not a leap year)
2.9.2
Universal time
Universal time coordinated (UTC) is the time used for all civil timekeep-
ing purposes, and it is the time reference which is broadcast by the
National Bureau of Standards as a standard for setting clocks. It is based
on an atomic time-frequency standard. The fundamental unit for UTC is
the mean solar day [see App. J in Wertz (1984)]. In terms of “clock time,”
the mean solar day is divided into 24 hours, an hour into 60 minutes, and
a minute into 60 seconds. Thus there are 86,400 “clock seconds” in a
mean solar day. Satellite-orbit epoch time is given in terms of UTC.
Example 2.9
Calculate the time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds for
the epoch day 324.95616765.
solution
This represents the 324th day of the year plus 0.95616765 mean
solar day. The decimal fraction in hours is 24  0.95616765  22.948022;
the decimal fraction of this, 0.948022, in minutes is 60  0.948022 
56.881344; the decimal fraction of this in seconds is 60  0.881344 
52.88064. The epoch is at 22 h, 56 min, 52.88 s on the 324th day of the year.
Universal time coordinated is equivalent to Greenwich mean time
(GMT), as well as Zulu (Z) time. There are a number of other “univer-
38
Chapter Two
TLFeBOOK

sal time” systems, all interrelated (see Wertz, 1984) and all with the
mean solar day as the fundamental unit. For present purposes, the
distinction between these systems is not critical, and the term univer-
sal time, abbreviation UT, will be used from now on.
For computations, UT will be required in two forms: as a fraction of
a day and in degrees. Given UT in the normal form of hours, minutes,
and seconds, it is converted to fractional days as
UTday 
(hours 

)
(2.18)
In turn, this may be converted to degrees as
UT°  360  UTday
(2.19)
2.9.3
Julian dates1
Calendar times are expressed in UT, and although the time interval
between any two events may be measured as the difference in their
calendar times, the calendar time notation is not suited to computa-
tions where the timing of many events has to be computed. What is
required is a reference time to which all events can be related in deci-
mal days. Such a reference time is provided by the Julian zero time
reference, which is 12 noon (12:00 UT) on January 1 in the year 4713
B.C.! Of course, this date would not have existed as such at the time; it
is a hypothetical starting point which can be established by counting
backward according to a certain formula. For details of this intriguing
time reference, see Wertz (1984). The important point is that ordinary
calendar times are easily converted to Julian dates, measured on a
continuous time scale of Julian days. To do this, first determine the
day of the year, keeping in mind that day zero, denoted as Jan 0, is
December 31. For example, noon on December 31 is denoted as Jan
0.5, and noon on January 1 is denoted as Jan 1.5. It may seem strange
that the last day of December should be denoted as “day zero in
January,” but it will be seen that this makes the day count correspond
to the actual calendar day.
A general method for calculating the Julian day for any date and
time is given in Duffett-Smith (1986, p. 9). The Mathcad routine based
on this is illustrated in the following example.

In Sec. 2.9.7, certain calculations require a time interval measured
in Julian centuries, where a Julian century consists of 36,525 mean

January 0.5, 1900, which corresponds to 2,415,020 Julian days.

stars is not a complete rotation relative to the sun. This is because the
earth moves in its orbit around the sun.
The sidereal day is defined as one complete rotation of the earth
relative to the fixed stars. One sidereal day has 24 sidereal hours,
one sidereal hour has 60 sidereal minutes, and one sidereal minute
has 60 sidereal seconds. Care must be taken to distinguish between
sidereal times and mean solar times which use the same basic sub-
divisions. The relationships between the two systems, given in Bate
et al. (1971), are
1 mean solar day  1.0027379093 mean sidereal days
 24h 3m 56s .55536 sidereal time
(2.21)
 86,636.55536 mean sidereal seconds

 23h 56m 04s .09054 mean solar time
(2.22)
 86,164.09054 mean solar seconds
Measurements of longitude on the earth’s surface require the use of
sidereal time (discussed further in Sec. 2.9.7). The use of 23 h, 56 min
as an approximation for the mean sidereal day will be used later in
determining the height of the geostationary orbit.
2.9.5
The orbital plane
In the orbital plane, the position vector r and the velocity vector v
specify the motion of the satellite, as shown in Fig. 2.8. For present
purposes, only the magnitude of the position vector is required. From
the geometry of the ellipse (see App. B), this is found to be
r 
(2.23)
The true anomaly  is a function of time, and determining it is one of
the more difficult steps in the calculations.
The usual approach to determining  proceeds in two stages.
First, the mean anomaly M at time t is found. This is a simple cal-
culation:
M  n (t  T)
(2.24)
Here, n is the mean motion, as previously defined in Eq. (2.8), and T
is the time of perigee passage.
a (1  e2)

Chapter Two
TLFeBOOK

The time of perigee passage T can be eliminated from Eq. (2.24) if one
is working from the elements specified by NASA. For the NASA elements,
M0  n (t0  T)
Therefore,
T  t0 
(2.25)
Hence, substituting this in Eq. (2.24) gives
M  M0  n (t  t0)
(2.26)
Consistent units must be used throughout. For example, with n in
degrees/day, time (t  t0) must be in days and M0 in degrees, and M
will then be in degrees.

instance it is only necessary to convert the mean motion to degrees/day,
which is 360n. Applying Eq. (2.25) gives

Once the mean anomaly M is known, the next step is to solve an
equation known as Kepler’s equation. Kepler’s equation is formulated
in terms of an intermediate variable E, known as the eccentric anom-
aly, and is usually stated as
M  E  e sin E
(2.27)
This rather innocent looking equation requires an iterative solution,

to solve for E as the root of the equation

The magnitude r of the position vector r may be calculated by either
Eq. (2.23) or Eq. (2.30). It may be expressed in vector form in the perifo-
cal coordinate system. Here, the orbital plane is the fundamental plane,
and the origin is at the center of the earth (only earth-orbiting satellites
are being considered). The positive x axis lies in the orbital plane and
passes through the perigee. Unit vector P points along the positive x axis
as shown in Fig. 2.8. The positive y axis is rotated 90° from the x axis in
the orbital plane, in the direction of satellite motion, and the unit vector
is shown as Q. The positive z axis is normal to the orbital plane such that
coordinates xyz form a right-hand set, and the unit vector is shown as W.
The subscript

as shown in Fig. 2.8. The position vector in this coordinate system, which
will be referred to as the PQW frame, is given by

The perifocal system is very convenient for describing the motion of
the satellite. If the earth were uniformly spherical, the perifocal coor-
dinates would be fixed in space, i.e., inertial. However, the equatorial
bulge causes rotations of the perifocal coordinate system, as described
in Sec. 2.8.1. These rotations are taken into account when the satellite
position is transferred from perifocal coordinates to geocentric-equato-
rial coordinates, described in the next section.
Example 2.15
Using the values r  7257 km and   204.81° obtained in
the previous example, express r in vector form in the perifocal coordinate
system.

Hence

2.9.6
The geocentric-equatorial coordinate
system
The geocentric-equatorial coordinate system is an inertial system of
axes, the reference line being fixed by the fixed stars. The reference
line is the line of Aries described in Sec. 2.5. (The phenomenon known
as the precession of the equinoxes is ignored here. This is a very slow
rotation of this reference frame, amounting to approximately
1.396971° per Julian century, where a Julian century consists of
36,525 mean solar days.) The fundamental plane is the earth’s equa-
torial plane. Figure 2.9 shows the part of the ellipse above the equato-
rial plane and the orbital angles , 
, and i. It should be kept in mind
that  and 
 may be slowly varying with time, as shown by Eqs. (2.12)
and (2.13).
The unit vectors in this system are labeled I, J, and K, and the coor-
dinate system is referred to as the IJK frame, with positive I pointing
along the line of Aries. The transformation of vector r from the PQW
frame to the IJK frame is most easily expressed in matrix form, the
components being indicated by the appropriate subscripts:
rIrJ	  R˜ rP

bulge, as described in Sec. 2.8.1. Because matrix multiplication is most
easily carried out by computer, the following example is completed in
Mathcad.

Earth station referred to the IJK
frame
The earth station’s position is given by the geographic coordinates of
latitude E and longitude E. (Unfortunately, there does not seem to be
any standardization of the symbols used for latitude and longitude. In
some texts, as here, the Greek lambda is used for latitude and the
Greek phi for longitude. In other texts, the reverse of this happens. One
minor advantage of the former is that latitude and lambda both begin
with the same la which makes the relationship easy to remember.)
Care also must be taken regarding the sign conventions used for lat-
itude and longitude because different systems are sometimes used,
depending on the application. In this book, north latitudes will be tak-
en as positive numbers and south latitudes as negative numbers, zero
latitude, of course, being the equator. Longitudes east of the
Greenwich meridian will be taken as positive numbers, and longitudes
west, as negative numbers.

Chapter Two
TLFeBOOK

The position vector of the earth station relative to the IJK frame is
R as shown in Fig. 2.10. The angle between R and the equatorial
plane, denoted by E in Fig. 2.10, is closely related, but not quite equal
to, the earth station latitude. More will be said about this angle short-
ly. R is obviously a function of the rotation of the earth, and so first it
is necessary to find the position of the Greenwich meridian relative to
the I axis as a function of time. The angular distance from the I axis
to the Greenwich meridian is measured directly as Greenwich sidereal
time (GST), also known as the Greenwich hour angle, or GHA. Sidereal
time is described in Sec. 2.9.4.
GST may be found using values tabulated in some almanacs (see
Bate et al., 1971), or it may be calculated using formulas given in
Wertz (1984). In general, sidereal time may be measured in time
units of sidereal days, hours, and so on, or it may be measured in
degrees, minutes, and seconds. The formula for GST in degrees is
GST  99.6910  36,000.7689  T  0.0004  T 2  UT°
(2.34)
Here, UT° is universal time expressed in degrees, as given by Eq.
(2.19). T is the time in Julian centuries, given by Eq. (2.20).
Once GST is known, the local sidereal time (LST) is found by adding
the east longitude of the station in degrees. East longitude for the

earth station will be denoted as EL. Recall that previously longitude
was expressed in positive degrees east and negative degrees west. For
east longitudes, EL  E, while for west longitudes, EL  360°  E.
For example, for an earth station at east longitude 40°, EL  40°. For
an earth station at west longitude 40°, EL  360  (40)  320°. Thus
the local sidereal time in degrees is given by
LST  GST  EL
(2.35)
The procedure is illustrated in the following examples
Example 2.17

From Example 2.11:

Note that Mathcad stores this result in radians even though the terms are
in degrees:

The universal time is

Converting this to a fraction of earth rotation:

LST :  mod (LST, 2  	) 
LST  193.189  deg

Knowing the LST enables the position vector R of the earth station
to be located with reference to the IJK frame as shown in Fig. 2.10.
However, when R is resolved into its rectangular components, account
must be taken of the oblateness of the earth. The earth may be mod-
eled as an oblate spheroid, in which the equatorial plane is circular,
and any meridional plane (i.e., any plane containing the earth’s polar
axis) is elliptical, as illustrated in Fig. 2.11. For one particular model,
known as a reference ellipsoid, the semimajor axis of the ellipse is
equal to the equatorial radius, the semiminor axis is equal to the polar
radius, and the surface of the ellipsoid represents the mean sea level.
Denoting the semimajor axis by aE and the semiminor axis by bE and
using the known values for the earth’s radii gives
aE  6378.1414 km
(2.36)
bE  6356.755 km
(2.37)
From these values, the eccentricity of the earth is seen to be
eE 
 0.08182
(2.38)
In Figs. 2.10 and 2.11, what is known as the geocentric latitude is
shown as E. This differs from what is normally referred to as latitude.
An imaginary plumb line dropped from the earth station makes an
angle E with the equatorial plane, as shown in Fig. 2.11. This is
known as the geodetic latitude, and for all practical purposes here, this
can be taken as the geographic latitude of the earth station.

At this point, both the satellite radius vector r and the earth station
radius vector R are known in the IJK frame for any position of satel-
lite and earth. From the vector diagram shown in Fig. 2.12a, the range
vector  is obtained as
  r  R
(2.43)
This gives  in the IJK frame. It then remains to transform  to the
observer’s frame, known as the topocentric-horizon frame, shown in
Fig. 2.12b.
2.9.8
The topocentric-horizon coordinate
system
The position of the satellite, as measured from the earth station, is usu-
ally given in terms of the azimuth and elevation angles and the range .
These are measured in the topocentric-horizon coordinate system illus-
trated in Fig. 2.12b. In this coordinate system, the fundamental plane is
the observer’s horizon plane. In the notation given in Bate et al. (1971),
the positive x axis is taken as south, the unit vector being denoted by S.
The positive y axis points east, the unit vector being E. The positive z
axis is “up,” pointing to the observer’s zenith, the unit vector being Z.
(Note: This is not the same z as that used in Sec. 2.9.7.) The frame is
referred to as the SEZ frame, which of course rotates with the earth.
As shown in the previous section, the range vector  is known in the
IJK frame, and it is now necessary to transform this to the SEZ frame.

The coordinates l and z given in Eqs. (2.40) and (2.42) are known in
terms of the earth station height and latitude, and hence the range
vector is known in terms of these quantities and the LST. As a point of
interest, for zero height, the angle E is known as the geocentric lati-
tude and is given by
tan E (H  0)  (1  eE

(2.46)
Here, eE is the earth’s eccentricity, equal to 0.08182. The difference
between the geodetic and geocentric latitudes reaches a maximum at
a geocentric latitude of 45°, when the geodetic latitude is 45.192°.

The subsatellite point
The point on the earth vertically under the satellite is referred to as
the subsatellite point. The latitude and longitude of the subsatellite
point and the height of the satellite above the subsatellite point can be
determined from a knowledge of the radius vector r. Figure 2.13 shows
the meridian plane which cuts the subsatellite point. The height of the
terrain above the reference ellipsoid at the subsatellite point is denot-
ed by HSS, and the height of the satellite above this, by hSS. Thus the
total height of the satellite above the reference ellipsoid is
h  HSS  hSS
(2.50)
Now the components of the radius vector r in the IJK frame are giv-
en by Eq. (2.33). Figure 2.13 is seen to be similar to Fig. 2.11, with the
difference that r replaces R, the height to the point of interest is h
rather than H, and the subsatellite latitude SS is used. Thus Eqs.

Sun-Synchronous Orbit
Some details of the Tiros-N/NOAA satellites used for search and res-
cue (Sarsat) operations are given in Sec. 1.5. These satellites operate
in sun-synchronous orbits. The orientation of a sun-synchronous orbit
remains fixed relative to the sun, as illustrated in Fig. 2.14, the angle
 remaining constant.
Figure 2.15 shows an alternative view, from above the earth’s
north pole. The angle  is equal to    and to the local solar time
expressed in degrees, as will be explained shortly. From this view,
the earth rotates daily around a fixed axis in space, and the sun
appears to move in space, relative to the fixed stars, because of the
earth’s yearly orbit around the sun. The mean yearly orbit of 360°
takes 365.24 mean solar days, and hence the daily shift is
360/365.24  0.9856°. The angle , shown in Fig. 2.15 and known as
the right ascension of the mean sun, moves eastward by this amount
each day.

Chapter Two
Figure 2.14
Sun-synchronous orbit.
TLFeBOOK

For the satellite orbit to be sun-synchronous, the right ascension of
the ascending node  also must increase eastward by this amount.
Use is made of the regression of the nodes to achieve sun synchronici-
ty. As shown in Sec. 2.8.1 by Eqs. (2.12) and (2.14), the rate of regres-
sion of the nodes and the direction are determined by the orbital
elements a, e, and i. These can be selected to give the required regres-
sion of 0.9856° east per day.
The orbital parameters for the Tiros-N satellites are listed in Table
2.3. These satellites follow near-circular, near-polar orbits.
From Fig. 2.15 it will be seen that with sun synchronicity the
angle    remains constant. This is the angle  shown in Fig.
2.14. Solar time is measured by the angle between the sun line and

The condition for sun synchronicity is that the local solar time
should be constant. Local solar time    , which is also equal to the angle

the meridian line, as shown in Fig. 2.15, known as the hour angle.
For example, universal time discussed in Sec. 2.9.2 is the hour
angle between the sun and the Greenwich meridian, as shown in
Fig. 2.15. Likewise, local solar time is the hour angle between the
sun and the local meridian. The local solar time for the line of nodes
is seen to be   , and as shown, for a sun-synchronous orbit this
is constant. In this case the latitude is zero (equator), but a similar
argument can be applied for the local solar time at any latitude.
What this means in practical terms is that a satellite in sun-syn-
chronous orbit crosses a given latitude at the same local solar time
and hence under approximately the same solar lighting conditions
each day. This is a desirable feature for weather and surveillance
satellites.
Local solar time is not the same as standard time. Letting  repre-
sent the longitude of the ascending node in Fig. 2.15 gives
Local solar time  UT  
(2.56)
As before,  is negative if west and positive if east. UT is related to
standard time by a fixed amount. For example, universal time is equal
to eastern standard time plus 5 hours. If the correction between stan-
dard time and UT is S hours, then
UT  standard time  S
(2.57)
This can be substituted in Eq. (2.56) to find the relationship between
local standard time and local solar time.
If a satellite in sun-synchronous orbit completes an integral num-
ber of orbits per day, it also will be earth-synchronous. This means
that equatorial crossings separated in time by a 1-day period will
occur at the same longitude and hence at the same standard time. As
it is, the Tiros-N satellites do not have an integral number of orbits
per day, and although the local solar time of crossings remains
unchanged, the standard time will vary, as will the longitude. The
same arguments as used here for equatorial crossings can be applied
to any latitude.
The nodal regression given in Table 2.3 is the number of degrees
rotated by the earth during one orbit of the satellite, and is approxi-
mately equal to 360° divided by the number of orbits per day. It clear-
ly is different from the rate of nodal precession.

The Geostationary Orbit
3.1.
Introduction
A satellite in a geostationary orbit appears to be stationary with
respect to the earth, hence the name geostationary. Three conditions
are required for an orbit to be geostationary:
1. The satellite must travel eastward at the same rotational speed as
the earth.
2. The orbit must be circular.
3. The inclination of the orbit must be zero.
The first condition is obvious. If the satellite is to appear stationary,
it must rotate at the same speed as the earth, which is constant. The
second condition follows from this and from Kepler’s second law (Sec.
2.3). Constant speed means that equal areas must be swept out in
equal times, and this can only occur with a circular orbit (see Fig. 2.2).
The third condition, that the inclination must be zero, follows from the
fact that any inclination would have the satellite moving north and
south, (see Sec. 2.5 and Fig. 2.3), and hence it would not be geosta-
tionary. Movement north and south can be avoided only with zero incli-
nation, which means that the orbit lies in the earth’s equatorial plane.
Kepler’s third law may be used to find the radius of the orbit (for a
circular orbit, the semimajor axis is equal to the radius). Denoting the
radius by aGSO, then from Eqs. (2.2) and (2.4),
aGSO  

The period P for the geostationary is 23 h, 56 min, 4 s mean solar
time (ordinary clock time). This is the time taken for the earth to com-
plete one revolution about its N-S axis, measured relative to the fixed
stars (see sidereal time, Sec. 2.9.4). Substituting this value along with
the value for  given by Eq. (2.3) results in
aGSO  42164 km
(3.2)
The equatorial radius of the earth, to the nearest kilometer, is
aE  6378 km
(3.3)
and hence the geostationary height is
hGSO  aGSO  aE
 42,164  6378
(3.4)
 35,786 km
This value is often rounded up to 36,000 km for approximate calcu-
lations. In practice, a precise geostationary orbit cannot be attained
because of disturbance forces in space and the effects of the earth’s
equatorial bulge. The gravitational fields of the sun and the moon pro-
duce a shift of about 0.85°/year in inclination. Also, the earth’s equato-
rial ellipticity causes the satellite to drift eastward along the orbit. In
practice, station-keeping maneuvers have to be performed periodically
to correct for these shifts, as described in Sec. 7.4.
An important point to grasp is that there is only one geostationary
orbit because there is only one value of a that satisfies Eq. (2.3) for a
periodic time of 23 h, 56 min, 4 s. Communications authorities
throughout the world regard the geostationary orbit as a natural
resource, and its use is carefully regulated through national and inter-
national agreements.
3.2
Antenna Look Angles
The look angles for the ground station antenna are the azimuth and
elevation angles required at the antenna so that it points directly at
the satellite. In Sec. 2.9.8 the look angles were determined in the gen-
eral case of an elliptical orbit, and there the angles had to change in
order to track the satellite. With the geostationary orbit, the situation
is much simpler because the satellite is stationary with respect to the
earth. Although in general no tracking should be necessary, with the
large earth stations used for commercial communications, the anten-
na beamwidth is very narrow (see Chap. 6), and a tracking mechanism
68
Chapter Three
TLFeBOOK

is required to compensate for the movement of the satellite about the
nominal geostationary position. With the types of antennas used for
home reception, the antenna beamwidth is quite broad, and no track-
ing is necessary. This allows the antenna to be fixed in position, as evi-
denced by the small antennas used for reception of satellite TV that
can be seen fixed to the sides of homes.
The three pieces of information that are needed to determine the
look angles for the geostationary orbit are
1. The earth station latitude, denoted here by E
2. The earth station longitude, denoted here by E
3. The longitude of the subsatellite point, denoted here by SS (often
this is just referred to as the satellite longitude)
As in Chap. 2, latitudes north will be taken as positive angles, and
latitudes south, as negative angles. Longitudes east of the Greenwich
meridian will be taken as positive angles, and longitudes west, as
negative angles. For example, if a latitude of 40°S is specified, this
will be taken as 40°, and if a longitude of 35°W is specified, this will
be taken as 35°.
In Chap. 2, when calculating the look angles for lower-earth-orbit
(LEO) satellites, it was necessary to take into account the variation in
earth’s radius. With the geostationary orbit, this variation has negli-
gible effect on the look angles, and the average radius of the earth will
be used. Denoting this by R:
R  6371 km
(3.5)
The geometry involving these quantities is shown in Fig. 3.1. Here,
ES denotes the position of the earth station, SS the subsatellite point,
S the satellite, and d is the range from the earth station to the satel-
lite. The angle  is an angle to be determined.
There are two types of triangles involved in the geometry of Fig. 3.1,
the spherical triangle shown in heavy outline in Fig. 3.2a and the
plane triangle of Fig. 3.2b. Considering first the spherical triangle,
the sides are all arcs of great circles, and these sides are defined by
the angles subtended by them at the center of the earth. Side a is the
angle between the radius to the north pole and the radius to the sub-
satellite point, and it is seen that a  90°. A spherical triangle in
which one side is 90° is called a quadrantal triangle. Angle b is the
angle between the radius to the earth station and the radius to 
the subsatellite point. Angle c is the angle between the radius to the
earth station and the radius to the north pole. From Fig. 3.2a it is
seen that c  90°  E.

TLFeBOOK

There are six angles in all defining the spherical triangle. The three
angles A, B, and C are the angles between the planes. Angle A is the
angle between the plane containing c and the plane containing b.
Angle B is the angle between the plane containing c and the plane con-
taining a. From Fig. 3.2a, B  E  SS. It will be shown shortly that
the maximum value of B is 81.3°. Angle C is the angle between the
plane containing b and the plane containing a.
To summarize to this point, the information known about the spher-
ical triangle is
a  90°
(3.6)
c  90°  E
(3.7)

Note that when the earth station is west of the subsatellite point, B
is negative, and when east, B is positive. When the earth station lati-
tude is north, c is less than 90°, and when south, c is greater than 90°.
Special rules, known as Napier’s rules, are used to solve the spherical
triangle (see, for example, Wertz, 1984), and these have been modified
here to take into account the signed angles B and E. Only the result
will be stated here. Napier’s rules gives angle b as

Two values will satisfy Eq. (3.10), A and 180°  A, and these must be

The preceding results do not take into account the case when the
earth station is on the equator. Obviously, when the earth station is
directly under the satellite, the elevation is 90°, and the azimuth is
irrelevant. When the subsatellite point is east of the equatorial earth
station (B  0), the azimuth is 90°, and when west (B  0), the
azimuth is 270°. Also, the range as determined by Eq. (3.11) is approx-
imate, and where more accurate values are required, as, for example,
where propagation times need to be known accurately, the range is
determined by measurement.
For a typical home installation, practical adjustments will be made
to align the antenna to a known satellite for maximum signal. Thus

the look angles need not be determined with great precision but are
calculated to give the expected values for a satellite whose longitude is
close to the earth station longitude. In some cases, especially with
direct broadcast satellites (DBS), the home antenna is aligned to one
particular cluster of satellites, as described in Chap. 16, and no further
adjustments are necessary.
3.3
The Polar Mount Antenna
Where the home antenna has to be steerable, expense usually pre-
cludes the use of separate azimuth and elevation actuators. Instead,
a single actuator is used which moves the antenna in a circular arc.
This is known as a polar mount antenna. The antenna pointing can
only be accurate for one satellite, and some pointing error must be
accepted for satellites on either side of this. With the polar mount
antenna, the dish is mounted on an axis termed the polar axis such
that the antenna boresight is normal to this axis, as shown in Fig.
3.5a. The polar mount is aligned along a true north line, as shown in
Fig. 3.5, with the boresight pointing due south. The angle between the
polar mount and the local horizontal plane is set equal to the earth
station latitude E; simple geometry shows that this makes the bore-
sight lie parallel to the equatorial plane. Next, the dish is tilted at an
angle  relative to the polar mount until the boresight is pointing at
a satellite position due south of the earth station. Note that there does
not need to be an actual satellite at this position. (The angle of tilt is
often referred to as the declination, which must not be confused with
the magnetic declination used in correcting compass readings. The
term angle of tilt will be used for  in this text.)
The required angle of tilt is found as follows: From the geometry of
Fig. 3.5b,

where El0 is the angle of elevation required for the satellite position

In the calculations leading to d, a spherical earth of mean radius
6371 km may be assumed and earth station elevation may be ignored,
as was done in the previous section. The value obtained for  will be
sufficiently accurate for initial alignment and fine adjustments can be
made if necessary. Calculation of the angle of tilt is illustrated in
Example 3.3.

Limits of Visibility
There will be east and west limits on the geostationary arc visible from
any given earth station. The limits will be set by the geographic coor-
dinates of the earth station and the antenna elevation. The lowest ele-
vation in theory is zero, when the antenna is pointing along the
horizontal. A quick estimate of the longitudinal limits can be made by
considering an earth station at the equator, with the antenna pointing
either west or east along the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 3.6. The lim-
iting angle is given by
  arccos 
 arccos 
(3.16)
 81.3°
Thus, for this situation, an earth station could see satellites over a geo-
stationary arc bounded by ±81.3° about the earth station longitude.
In practice, to avoid reception of excessive noise from the earth,
some finite minimum value of elevation is used, which will be denoted

Near Geostationary Orbits
As mentioned in Sec. 2.8, there are a number of perturbing forces that
cause an orbit to depart from the ideal keplerian orbit. For the geo-
stationary case, the most important of these are the gravitational
fields of the moon and the sun and the nonspherical shape of the earth.
Other significant forces are solar radiation pressure and reaction of
the satellite itself to motor movement within the satellite. As a result,
station keeping maneuvers must be carried out to maintain the satel-
lite within set limits of its nominal geostationary position. Station
keeping is discussed in Sec. 7.4.
An exact geostationary orbit therefore is not attainable in practice,
and the orbital parameters vary with time. The two-line orbital ele-
ments are published at regular intervals, Fig. 3.7 showing typical val-
ues. The period for a geostationary satellite is 23 h, 56 min, 4 s, or
86,164 s. The reciprocal of this is 1.00273896 rev/day, which is about
the value tabulated for most of the satellites in Fig. 3.7. Thus these
satellites are geosynchronous, in that they rotate in synchronism with
the rotation of the earth. However, they are not geostationary. The
term geosynchronous satellite is used in many cases instead of geosta-
tionary to describe these near-geostationary satellites. It should be

noted, however, that in general a geosynchronous satellite does not
have to be near-geostationary, and there are a number of geosynchro-
nous satellites that are in highly elliptical orbits with comparatively
large inclinations (e.g., the Tundra satellites).
Although in principle the two-line elements could be used as
described in Chap. 2 to determine orbital motion, the small inclination
makes it difficult to locate the position of the ascending node, and the
small eccentricity makes it difficult to locate the position of the
perigee. However, because of the small inclination, the angles 
 and 
are almost in the same plane, and this approximation is used. Thus

3.6
Earth Eclipse of Satellite
If the earth’s equatorial plane coincided with the plane of the earth’s
orbit around the sun (the ecliptic plane), geostationary satellites would
be eclipsed by the earth once each day. As it is, the equatorial plane is
tilted at an angle of 23.4° to the ecliptic plane, and this keeps the satel-
lite in full view of the sun for most days of the year, as illustrated by
position A in Fig. 3.8. Around the spring and autumnal equinoxes,
when the sun is crossing the equator, the satellite does pass into the
earth’s shadow at certain periods, these being periods of eclipse as
illustrated in Fig. 3.8. The spring equinox is the first day of spring, and
the autumnal equinox is the first day of autumn.
Eclipses begin 23 days before equinox and end 23 days after
equinox. The eclipse lasts about 10 min at the beginning and end of the
eclipse period and increases to a maximum duration of about 72 min
at full eclipse (Spilker, 1977). During an eclipse, the solar cells do not
function, and operating power must be supplied from batteries. This is
discussed further in Sec. 7.2, and Fig. 7.3 shows eclipse time as a func-
tion of days of the year.
Where the satellite longitude is east of the earth station, the satel-
lite enters eclipse during daylight (and early evening) hours for the

earth station, as illustrated in Fig. 3.9. This can be undesirable if the
satellite has to operate on reduced battery power. Where the satellite
longitude is west of the earth station, eclipse does not occur until the
earth station is in darkness, when usage is likely to be low. Thus satel-
lite longitudes which are west, rather than east, of the earth station
are more desirable.
3.7
Sun Transit Outage
Another event which must be allowed for during the equinoxes is the
transit of the satellite between earth and sun (see Fig. 3.8), such that
the sun comes within the beamwidth of the earth station antenna.
When this happens, the sun appears as an extremely noisy source
which completely blanks out the signal from the satellite. This effect
is termed sun transit outage, and it lasts for short periods each day for
about 6 days around the equinoxes. The occurrence and duration of the
sun transit outage depends on the latitude of the earth station, a max-
imum outage time of 10 min being typical.
3.8
Launching Orbits
Satellites may be directly injected into low-altitude orbits, up to about
200 km altitude, from a launch vehicle. Launch vehicles may be clas-
sified as expendable or reusable. Typical of the expendable launchers
are the U.S. Atlas-Centaur and Delta rockets and the European Space
Agency Ariane rocket. Japan, China, and Russia all have their own
expendable launch vehicles, and one may expect to see competition for
commercial launches among the countries which have these facilities.
The Geostationary Orbit

TLFeBOOK

Until the tragic mishap with the Space Shuttle in 1986, this was to be
the primary transportation system for the United States. As a reusable
launch vehicle, the shuttle, also referred to as the Space Transportation
System (STS), was planned to eventually replace expendable launch
vehicles for the United States (Mahon and Wild, 1984).
Where an orbital altitude greater than about 200 km is required, it
is not economical in terms of launch vehicle power to perform direct
injection, and the satellite must be placed into transfer orbit between
the initial low earth orbit and the final high-altitude orbit. In most
cases, the transfer orbit is selected to minimize the energy required for
transfer, and such an orbit is known as a Hohmann transfer orbit. The
time required for transfer is longer for this orbit than all other possi-
ble transfer obits.
Assume for the moment that all orbits are in the same plane and
that transfer is required between two circular orbits, as illustrated in
Fig. 3.10. The Hohmann elliptical orbit is seen to be tangent to the
low-altitude orbit at perigee and to the high-altitude orbit at apogee.
At the perigee, in the case of rocket launch, the rocket injects the satel-
lite with the required thrust into the transfer orbit. With the STS, the
satellite must carry a perigee kick motor which imparts the required
thrust at perigee. Details of the expendable vehicle launch are shown in
Fig. 3.11 and of the STS launch, in Fig. 3.12. At apogee, the apogee kick
motor (AKM) changes the velocity of the satellite to place it into a circu-
lar orbit in the same plane. As shown in Fig. 3.11, it takes 1 to 2 months
for the satellite to be fully operational (although not shown in Fig. 3.12,
the same conditions apply). Throughout the launch and acquisition phas-
es, a network of ground stations, spread across the earth, is required to
perform the tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) functions.

TLFeBOOK

Velocity changes in the same plane change the geometry of the orbit
but not its inclination. In order to change the inclination, a velocity
change is required normal to the orbital plane. Changes in inclination
can be made at either one of the nodes, without affecting the other
orbital parameters. Since energy must be expended to make any
orbital changes, a geostationary satellite should be launched initially
with as low an orbital inclination as possible. It will be shown shortly
that the smallest inclination obtainable at initial launch is equal to the
latitude of the launch site. Thus the farther away from the equator a
launch site is, the less useful it is, since the satellite has to carry extra
fuel to effect a change in inclination. Russia does not have launch sites
south of 45°N, which makes the launching of geostationary satellites
a much more expensive operation for Russia than for other countries
which have launch sites closer to the equator.
Prograde (direct) orbits (Fig. 2.4) have an easterly component of
velocity, and these launches gain from the earth’s rotational velocity.
For a given launcher size, a significantly larger payload can be
launched in an easterly direction than is possible with a retrograde
(westerly) launch. In particular, easterly launches are used for the ini-
tial launch into the geostationary orbit.
The relationship between inclination, latitude, and azimuth may be
seen as follows [this analysis is based on that given in Bate et al.
(1971)]. Figure 3.13a shows the geometry at the launch site A at lati-
tude  (the slight difference between geodetic and geocentric latitudes
may be ignored here). The dotted line shows the satellite earth track,
the satellite having been launched at some azimuth angle Az. Angle i
is the resulting inclination.

The spherical triangle of interest is shown in more detail in Fig.

positive. It follows therefore from Eq. (3.23) that 0  Az  180°, or the
launch azimuth must be easterly in order to obtain a prograde orbit,
confirming what was already known.
For a fixed , Eq. (3.23) also shows that to minimize the inclination
i, cos i should be a maximum, which requires sin Az to be maximum,
or Az  90°. Equation (3.23) shows that under these conditions

Thus the lowest inclination possible on initial launch is equal to the
latitude of the launch site. This result confirms the converse statement
made in Sec. 2.5 under inclination that the greatest latitude north or
south is equal to the inclination. From Cape Kennedy the smallest ini-
tial inclination which can be achieved for easterly launches is approx-
imately 28°.

Radio Wave Propagation
4.1
Introduction
A signal traveling between an earth station and a satellite must pass
through the earth’s atmosphere, including the ionosphere, as shown in
Fig. 4.1, and this can introduce certain impairments, which are sum-
marized in Table 4.1.
Some of the more important of these impairments will be described
in this chapter.
4.2
Atmospheric Losses
Losses occur in the earth’s atmosphere as a result of energy absorp-
tion by the atmospheric gases. These losses are treated quite sepa-
rately from those which result from adverse weather conditions,
which of course are also atmospheric losses. To distinguish between
these, the weather-related losses are referred to as atmospheric
attenuation and the absorption losses simply as atmospheric
absorption.
The atmospheric absorption loss varies with frequency, as shown in
Fig. 4.2. The figure is based on statistical data (CCIR Report 719-1,
1982). Two absorption peaks will be observed, the first one at a fre-
quency of 22.3 GHz, resulting from resonance absorption in water
vapor (H2O), and the second one at 60 GHz, resulting from resonance
absorption in oxygen (O2). However, at frequencies well clear of these
peaks, the absorption is quite low. The graph in Fig. 4.2 is for vertical
incidence, that is, for an elevation angle of 90° at the earth station
antenna. Denoting this value of absorption loss as [AA]90 decibels, then
for elevation angles down to 10°, an approximate formula for the
absorption loss in decibels is (CCIR Report 719-1, 1982)

where  is the angle of elevation. An effect known as atmospheric scin-
tillation also can occur. This is a fading phenomenon, the fading peri-
od being several tens of seconds (Miya, 1981). It is caused by
differences in the atmospheric refractive index, which in turn results
in focusing and defocusing of the radio waves, which follow different
ray paths through the atmosphere. It may be necessary to make an
allowance for atmospheric scintillation, through the introduction of a
fade margin in the link power-budget calculations.
4.3
Ionospheric Effects
Radio waves traveling between satellites and earth stations must pass
through the ionosphere. The ionosphere is the upper region of the
earth’s atmosphere, which has been ionized, mainly by solar radiation.

The free electrons in the ionosphere are not uniformly distributed but
form in layers. Furthermore, clouds of electrons (known as traveling
ionospheric disturbances) may travel through the ionosphere and give
rise to fluctuations in the signal that can only be determined on a sta-
tistical basis. The effects include scintillation, absorption, variation in
the direction of arrival, propagation delay, dispersion, frequency
change, and polarization rotation (CCIR Report 263-5, 1982). All these
effects decrease as frequency increases, most in inverse proportion to
the frequency squared, and only the polarization rotation and scintil-
lation effects are of major concern for satellite communications.
Polarization rotation is described in Sec. 5.5.
Ionospheric scintillations are variations in the amplitude, phase,
polarization, or angle of arrival of radio waves. They are caused by irreg-
ularities in the ionosphere which change with time. The main effect of
scintillations is fading of the signal. The fades can be quite severe, and
they may last up to several minutes. As with fading caused by atmos-
pheric scintillations, it may be necessary to include a fade margin in the
link power-budget calculations to allow for ionospheric scintillation.

Rain Attenuation
Rain attenuation is a function of rain rate. By rain rate is meant the
rate at which rainwater would accumulate in a rain gauge situated at
the ground in the region of interest (e.g., at an earth station). In cal-
culations relating to radio wave attenuation, the rain rate is measured
in millimeters per hour. Of interest is the percentage of time that spec-
ified values are exceeded. The time percentage is usually that of a
year; for example, a rain rate of 0.001 percent means that the rain rate
would be exceeded for 0.001 percent of a year, or about 5.3 min during
any one year. In this case the rain rate would be denoted by R0.001. In
general, the percentage time is denoted by p and the rain rate by Rp.
The specific attenuation  is

The subscripts h and v refer to horizontal and vertical polarizations

Once the specific attenuation is found, the total attenuation is deter-
mined as
A  L dB
(4.3)
where L is the effective path length of the signal through the rain.
Because the rain density is unlikely to be uniform over the actual path
length, an effective path length must be used rather than the actual (geo-
metric) length. Figure 4.3 shows the geometry of the situation. The geo-
metric, or slant, path length is shown as LS. This depends on the antenna
angle of elevation  and the rain height hR, which is the height at which
freezing occurs. Figure 4.4 shows curves for hR for different climatic
zones. In this figure, three methods are labeled: Method 1—maritime cli-
mates; Method 2—tropical climates; Method 3—continental climates. For
the last, curves are shown for p values of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 percent.
For small angles of elevation (El  10°), the determination of LS is
complicated by earth curvature (see CCIR Report 564-2). However, for
El  10°, a flat earth approximation may be used, and from Fig. 4.3 it

tion altitude is 600 m, and the antenna elevation angle is 50 degrees. The
rain height is 3 km.

The given data are shown below. Because the CCIR formula con-
tains hidden conversion factors, units will not be attached to the data, and
it is understood that all lengths and heights are in kilometers, and rain rate
is in millimeters per hour. The elevation angle, however, must be stated in

tions.

Hail, ice, and snow have little effect on attenuation because of the low
water content. Ice can cause depolarization, described briefly in Chap.
5. The attenuation resulting from clouds can be calculated like that for
rain (Ippolito, 1986, p. 56), although the attenuation is generally much
less. For example, at a frequency of 10 GHz and a water content of 0.25
g/m3, the specific attenuation is about 0.05 dB/km and about 0.2
dB/km for a water content of 2.5 g/m3.

Introduction
In the far field zone of a transmitting antenna, the radiated wave
takes on the characteristics of a transverse electromagnetic (TEM)
wave. By far field zone is meant at distances greater than 2D2/ from
the antenna, where D is the largest linear dimension of the antenna
and  is the wavelength. For a parabolic antenna of 3 m diameter
transmitting a 6-GHz wave (  5 cm), the far field zone begins at
approximately 360 m. The TEM designation is illustrated in Fig. 5.1,
where it can be seen that both the magnetic field H and the electric
field E are transverse to the direction of propagation, denoted by the
propagation vector k.
E, H, and k represent vector quantities, and it is important to note
their relative directions. When one looks along the direction of propa-
gation, the rotation from E to H is in the direction of rotation of a
right-hand-threaded screw, and the vectors are said to form a right-
hand set. The wave always retains the directional properties of the
right-hand set, even when reflected, for example. One way of remem-
bering how the right-hand set appears is to note that the letter E
comes before H in the alphabet, and rotation is from E to H when look-
ing along the direction of propagation.
At great distances from the transmitting antenna, such as are nor-
mally encountered in radio systems, the TEM wave can be considered
to be plane. This means that the E and H vectors lie in a plane which
is at right angles to the vector k. The vector k is said to be normal to
the plane. The magnitudes are related by E  HZ0, where Z0  120	
ohms.

The direction of the line traced out by the tip of the electric field vec-
tor determines the polarization of the wave. Keep in mind that the
electric and magnetic fields are varying as functions of time. The mag-
netic field varies exactly in phase with the electric field, and its ampli-
tude is proportional to the electric field amplitude, so it is only
necessary to consider the electric field in this discussion. The tip of the
E vector may trace out a straight line, in which case the polarization
is referred to as linear. Other forms of polarization, specifically ellipti-
cal and circular, will be introduced later.
In the early days of radio, there was little chance of ambiguity in
specifying the direction of polarization in relation to the surface of the
earth. Most transmissions utilized linear polarization and were along
terrestrial paths. Thus vertical polarization meant that the electric
field was perpendicular to the earth’s surface, and horizontal polar-
ization meant that it was parallel to the earth’s surface. Although the
terms vertical and horizontal are used with satellite transmissions,
the situation is not quite so clear. A linear polarized wave transmitted
by a geostationary satellite may be designated vertical if its electric
field is parallel to the earth’s polar axis, but even so the electric field
will be parallel to the earth at the equator. This situation will be clar-
ified shortly.
Suppose for the moment that horizontal and vertical are taken as
the x and y axes of a right-hand set, as shown in Fig. 5.2a. A vertical-
ly polarized electric field can be described as

where ây is the unit vector in the vertical direction and Ey is the peak
value or magnitude of the electric field. Likewise, a horizontally polar-
ized wave could be described by
Ex  âx Ex sin

(5.2)
These two fields would trace out the straight lines shown in Fig.
5.2b. Now consider the situation where both fields are present simul-
taneously. These would add vectorially, and the resultant would be a
vector E (Fig. 5.2c) at an angle to the horizontal given by
  arctan 
(5.3)
Note that E is still linearly polarized but cannot be classified as sim-
ply horizontal or vertical. Arguing back from this, it is evident that E
can be resolved into vertical and horizontal components, a fact which
is of great importance in practical transmission systems.
More formally, Ey and Ex are said to be orthogonal. The dictionary
definition of orthogonal is at right angles, but a wider meaning will be
attached to the word later.
Consider now the situation where the two fields are equal in magni-
tude (denoted by E), but one leads the other by 90° in phase. The equa-
tions describing these are

The tip of the resultant electric field vector traces out a circle, as
shown in Fig. 5.3a, and the resultant wave is said to be circularly
polarized. The direction of circular polarization is defined by the sense
of rotation of the electric vector, but this also requires that the way the
vector is viewed must be specified. The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines right-hand circular (RHC) polar-
ization as a rotation in the clockwise direction when the wave is
viewed along the direction of propagation, that is, when viewed from
“behind,” as shown in Fig. 5.3b. Left-hand circular (LHC) polarization
is when the rotation is in the counterclockwise direction when viewed
along the direction of propagation, as shown in Fig. 5.3c. LHC and
RHC polarizations are orthogonal. The direction of propagation is
along the z axis.
As a caution it should be noted that the classical optics definition of
circular polarization is just the opposite of the IEEE definition. The
IEEE definition will be used throughout this text.

The axial ratio of an elliptical polarized wave is the ratio of major axis
to minor axis of the ellipse. Orthogonal elliptical polarization occurs when
a wave has the same value of axial ratio but opposite sense of rotation.
Satellite communications links use linear polarization and circular
polarization, but transmission impairments can change the polarization
to elliptical in each case. Some of these impairments, relating to the
transmission medium, are described in Secs. 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7, and the
influence of the antenna structure on polarization is described in Chap.
6. Antennas are covered in detail in Chap. 6, but at this stage the rela-
tionship of the antenna to the polarization type will be defined.
5.2
Antenna Polarization
The polarization of a transmitting antenna is defined by the polariza-
tion of the wave it transmits. Thus a horizontal dipole would produce

a horizontally polarized wave. Two dipoles mounted close together
symmetrically and at right angles to each other would produce a cir-
cularly polarized wave if fed with currents equal in magnitude but dif-
fering in phase by 90°. This is shown by Eqs. (5.4) and (5.5). Note that
because of the symmetry of the circular polarization, the dipoles need
not lie along the horizontal and vertical axes; they just need to be spa-
tially at right angles to each other. The terms horizontal and vertical
are used for convenience.
The polarization of a receiving antenna has to be aligned to that of
the wave for maximum power transfer. Taking again the simple dipole
as an example, a vertical dipole will receive maximum signal from a
vertically polarized wave. Figure 5.5 illustrates this. In Fig. 5.5a the
dipole is parallel to the electric field E, and hence the induced voltage
V will be a maximum, denoted by Vmax. In Fig. 5.5b the dipole is at
right angles to the electric field, and the induced voltage is zero. In
Fig. 5.5c the dipole lies in the plane of polarization (the wavefront)
but is at some angle  to the electric field. The induced voltage will be
given by
V  Vmax cos 
(5.7)
Note that for Eq. (5.7) to apply, the dipole has to lie in the same
plane as E (the wavefront). If the dipole is inclined at some angle  to
the wavefront, the received signal is reduced further by the radiation
pattern of the antenna. This is described more fully in Sec. 6.6. The
reciprocity theorem for antennas (see Sec. 6.2) ensures that an anten-
na designed to transmit in a given polarization will receive maximum
power from a wave with that polarization. An antenna designed for a
given sense of polarization will receive no energy from a wave with the
orthogonal polarization. Figure 5.5a and b illustrates the specific case

where the desired signal is vertically polarized and the orthogonal sig-
nal is horizontally polarized. However, as mentioned above, certain
impairments can result in a loss of polarization discrimination, dis-
cussed in later sections.
The combined power received by the two crossed dipoles will be a
maximum when the incoming wave is circularly polarized. The aver-
age power received from a sinusoidal wave is proportional to the
square of the amplitude. Thus, for a circularly polarized wave given by
either of Eq. (5.4) or Eq. (5.5), the power received from each component
is proportional to E2, and the total power is twice that of one compo-
nent alone. The crossed dipoles would receive this total. A single dipole
will always receive a signal from a circularly polarized wave, but at a
loss of 3 dB. This is so because the single dipole will respond only to
one of the linear components, and hence the received power will be half
that of the crossed dipoles. Again, because of the symmetry of the cir-
cularly polarized wave, the dipole need only lie in the plane of polar-
ization; its orientation with respect to the xy axes is not a factor.
A grid of parallel wires will reflect a linear polarized wave when the
electric field is parallel to the wires, and it will transmit the orthogo-
nal wave. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.6. This is used in one type of dual
polarized antenna, illustrated in Fig. 5.7. Here, the grid allows the
wave whose electric field is transverse to the wires to pass through,
whereas it reflects the parallel (Ev) wave. The reflector behind the grid
reflects the wave that passes through. Thus two orthogonal, linearly
polarized waves, having high polarization isolation (see 5.4) are trans-
mitted from the antenna system. Some details of the construction of
this type of antenna will be found in Maral and Bousquet (1998).

Polarization of Satellite Signals
As mentioned above, the directions “horizontal” and “vertical” are eas-
ily visualized with reference to the earth. Consider, however, the situa-
tion where a geostationary satellite is transmitting a linear polarized
wave. In this situation, the usual definition of horizontal polarization is
where the electric field vector is parallel to the equatorial plane, and
vertical polarization is where the electric field vector is parallel to the
earth’s polar axis. It will be seen that at the subsatellite point on the
equator, both polarizations will result in electric fields that are parallel
to the local horizontal plane, and care must be taken therefore not to
use “horizontal” as defined for terrestrial systems. For other points on
the earth’s surface within the footprint of the satellite beam, the polar-
ization vector (the unit vector in the direction of the electric field) will
be at some angle relative to a reference plane. Following the work of
Hogg and Chu (1975), the reference plane will be taken to be that which
contains the direction of propagation and the local gravity direction (a
“plumb line”). This is shown in Fig. 5.8.

Cross-Polarization Discrimination
The propagation path between a satellite and earth station passes
through the ionosphere, and possibly through layers of ice crystals in
the upper atmosphere and rain, all of which are capable of altering the
polarization of the wave being transmitted. An orthogonal component
may be generated from the transmitted polarization, an effect referred
to as depolarization. This can cause interference where orthogonal
polarization is used to provide isolation between signals, as in the case
of frequency reuse.
Two measures are in use to quantify the effects of polarization inter-
ference. The most widely used measure is called cross-polarization dis-
crimination (XPD). Figure 5.11a shows how this is defined. The
transmitted electric field is shown having a magnitude E1 before it
enters the medium which causes depolarization. At the receiving
antenna the electric field may have two components, a copolar compo-
nent, having magnitude E11, and a cross-polar component, having
magnitude E12. The cross-polarization discrimination in decibels is
defined as

The second situation is shown in Fig. 5.11b. Here, two orthogonally
polarized signals, with magnitudes E1 and E2, are transmitted. After
traversing the depolarizing medium, copolar and cross-polar compo-
nents exist for both waves. The polarization isolation is defined by the
ratio of received copolar power to received cross-polar power and thus
takes into account any additional depolarization introduced by the
receiving system (Ippolito, 1986). Since received power is proportional

Maximum values quoted by Miya (1981) for Faraday rotation are 9°
at 4 GHz and 4° at 6 GHz. In order to counter the depolarizing effects
of Faraday rotation, circular polarization may be used. With circular
polarization, a Faraday shift simply adds to the overall rotation and
does not affect the copolar or cross-polar components of electric field.
Alternatively, if linear polarization is to be used, polarization tracking
equipment may be installed at the antenna.
5.6
Rain Depolarization
The ideal shape of a raindrop is spherical, since this minimizes the
energy (the surface tension) required to hold the raindrop together.
The shape of small raindrops is close to spherical, but larger drops are
better modeled as oblate spheroids with some flattening underneath,
as a result of the air resistance. These are sketched in Fig. 5.12a and
b. For vertically falling rain, the axis of symmetry of the raindrops
will be parallel to the local vertical as shown in Fig. 5.12b, but more
realistically, aerodynamic forces will cause some canting, or tilting, of
the drops. Thus there will be a certain randomness in the angle of tilt
as sketched in Fig. 5.12c.
As shown earlier, a linearly polarized wave can be resolved into two
component waves, one vertically polarized and the other horizontally
polarized. Consider a wave with its electric vector at some angle ! rel-
ative to the major axis of a raindrop, which for clarity is shown hori-
zontal in Fig. 5.13. The vertical component of the electric field lies

parallel to the minor axis of the raindrop and therefore encounters less
water than the horizontal component. There will be a difference there-
fore in the attenuation and phase shift experienced by each of the elec-
tric field components. These differences are termed the differential
attenuation and differential phase shift, and they result in depolariza-
tion of the wave. For the situation shown in Fig. 5.13, the angle of
polarization of the wave emerging from the rain is altered relative to
that of the wave entering the rain. Experience has shown that the
depolarization resulting from the differential phase shift is more sig-
nificant than that resulting from differential attenuation.
The cross-polarization discrimination in decibels associated with
rain is given to a good approximation by the empirical relationship
(CCIR Report 564-2)
XPD  U  V log A
(5.21)
where U and V are empirically determined coefficents and A is the rain
attenuation. U, V, and A must be in decibels in this equation. The atten-
uation A is as determined in Sec. 4.4. The following formulas are given
in the CCIR reference for U and V for the frequency range 8 to 35 GHz:

polarization relative to the horizontal. For circular polarization ! 

as with circular polarization the contribution is only about 0.13 dB.

5.7
Ice Depolarization
As shown in Fig. 4.3 an ice layer is present at the top of a rain region,
and as noted in Table 4.1, the ice crystals can result in depolarization.
The experimental evidence suggests that the chief mechanism produc-
ing depolarization in ice is differential phase shift, with little differen-
tial attenuation present. This is so because ice is a good dielectric,
unlike water, which has considerable losses. Ice crystals tend to be nee-
dle-shaped or platelike and, if randomly oriented, have little effect, but
depolarization occurs when they become aligned. Sudden increases in
XPD that coincide with lightning flashes are thought to be a result of
the lightning producing alignment. An International Radio Consultative
Committee (CCIR) recommendation for taking ice depolarization into
account is to add a fixed decibel value to the XPD value calculated for
rain. Values of 2 dB are suggested for North America and 4 to 5 dB for
maritime regions, and it is further suggested that the effects of ice can
be ignored for time percentages less than 0.1 percent (Ippolito, 1986).

Antennas
6.1
Introduction
Antennas can be broadly classified according to function as transmit-
ting antennas and as receiving antennas. Although the requirements
for each function, or mode of operation, are markedly different, a sin-
gle antenna may be, and frequently is, used for transmitting and
receiving signals simultaneously. Many of the properties of an anten-
na, such as its directional characteristics, apply equally to both modes
of operation, this being a result of the reciprocity theorem described in
the next section.
Certain forms of interference (see Chap. 13) can present particular
problems for satellite systems which are not encountered in other
radio systems, and minimizing these requires special attention to
those features of the antenna design which control interference.
Another way in which antennas for use in satellite communications
can be classified is into earth station antennas and satellite or space-
craft antennas. Although the general principles of antennas may apply
to each type, the constraints set by the physical environment lead to
quite different designs in each case.
Before looking at antennas specifically for use in satellite systems,
some of the general properties and definitions for antennas will be giv-
en in this and the next few sections. As already mentioned, antennas
form the link between transmitting and receiving equipment and the
space propagation path. Figure 6.1a shows the antenna as a radiator.
The power amplifier in the transmitter is shown as generating PT
watts. A feeder connects this to the antenna, and the net power reach-
ing the antenna will be PT minus the losses in the feeder. These losses

include ohmic losses and mismatch losses. The power will be further
reduced by losses in the antenna so that the power radiated, shown as
Prad, is less than that generated at the transmitter.
The antenna as a receiver is shown in Fig. 6.1b. Power Prec is trans-
ferred to the antenna from a passing radio wave. Again, losses in the
antenna will reduce the power available for the feeder. Receiver feed-
er losses will further reduce the power so that the amount PR reaching
the receiver is less than that received by the antenna.
6.2
Reciprocity Theorem for Antennas
The reciprocity theorem for antennas states that if a current I is
induced in an antenna B, operated in the receive mode, by an emf
applied at the terminals of antenna A operated in the transmit mode,
then the same emf applied to the terminals of B will induce the same
current at the terminals of A. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.2. For a
122

proof of the reciprocity theorem, see, for example, Glazier and
Lamont (1958).
A number of important consequences result from the reciprocity the-
orem. All practical antennas have directional patterns; that is, they
transmit more energy in some directions than others, and they receive
more energy when pointing in some directions than others. The reci-
procity theorem requires that the directional pattern for an antenna
operating in the transmit mode is the same as that when operating in
the receive mode.
Another important consequence of the reciprocity theorem is that
the antenna impedance is the same for both modes of operation.
6.3
Coordinate System
In order to discuss the directional patterns of an antenna, it is neces-
sary to set up a coordinate system to which these can be referred. The
system in common use is the spherical (or polar) coordinate system
illustrated in Fig. 6.3. The antenna is imagined to be at the origin of
the coordinates, and a distant point P in space is related to the origin

by the coordinates r, , and . Thus r is the radius vector, the magni-
tude of which gives the distance between point P and the antenna; 
is the angle measured from the x axis to the projection of r in the xy
plane; and  is the angle measured from the z axis to r.
It is important to note that the x, y, and z axes form a right-hand set.
What this means is that when one looks along the positive z direction,
a clockwise rotation is required to move from the positive x axis to the
positive y axis. This becomes particularly significant when the polar-
ization of the radio waves associated with antennas is described.
6.4
The Radiated Fields
There are three main components to the radiated electromagnetic
fields surrounding an antenna: two near-field regions and a far-field
region. The field strengths of the near-field components decrease
rapidly with increasing distance from the antenna, one component
being inversely related to distance squared, and the other to the dis-
tance cubed. At comparatively short distances these components are
negligible compared with the radiated component used for radio com-
munications, the field strength of which decreases in proportion to dis-
tance. Estimates for the distances at which the fields are significant
are shown in Fig. 6.4a. Here, D is the largest dimension of the anten-

na (e.g., the diameter of a parabolic dish reflector), and  is the wave-
length. Only the far-field region is of interest here, which applies for
distances greater than about 2D2/.
In the far-field region, the radiated fields form a transverse electro-
magnetic (TEM) wave in which the electric field is at right angles to
the magnetic field, and both are at right angles (transverse) to the

direction of propagation. The vector relationship is shown in Fig. 6.4b,
where E represents the electric field, H the magnetic field, and k the
direction of propagation. These vectors form a right-hand set in the
sense that when one looks along the direction of propagation, a clock-
wise rotation is required to go from E to H. An important practical
point is that the wavefront can be assumed to be plane; that is, E and
H lie in a plane to which k is a normal.
In the far field, the electric field vector can be resolved into two com-
ponents, which are shown in relation to the coordinate system in Fig.
6.5a. The component labeled E is tangent at point P to the circular arc
of radius r. The component labeled E is tangent at point P to the cir-
cle of radius r sin  centered on the z axis (this is similar to a circle of
latitude on the earth’s surface). Both these components are functions
of  and  and in functional notation would be written as E (, ) and
E (, ). The resultant magnitude of the electric field is given by
E  E
2 
E


(6.1)
Peak or rms values may be used in this equation.
The vector Eo shown at the origin of the coordinate system repre-
sents the principal electric vector of the antenna itself. For example,
for a horn antenna, this would be the electric field vector across the
aperture as shown in Fig. 6.5b. For definiteness, the Eo vector is shown
aligned with the y axis, since this allows two important planes to be
defined:
The H plane is the xz plane, for which   0
The E plane is the yz plane, for which   90°
Magnetic field vectors are associated with these electric field com-
ponents. Thus, following the right-hand rule, the magnetic vector asso-
ciated with the E component will lie parallel with E and is normally
denoted by H, while that associated with E will lie parallel (but
pointing in the opposite direction) to E and is denoted by H. For clar-
ity, the H fields are not shown in Fig. 6.5, but the magnitudes of the
fields are related through the wave impedance ZW. For radio waves in
free space, the value of the wave impedance is (in terms of field mag-
nitudes)

Power Flux Density
The power flux density of a radio wave is a quantity used in calculat-
ing the performance of satellite communications links. The concept
can be understood by imagining the transmitting antenna to be at the
center of a sphere. The power from the antenna radiates outward, nor-
mal to the surface of the sphere, and the power flux density is the pow-
er flow per unit surface area. Power flux density is a vector quantity,
and its magnitude is given by

 
(6.3)
Here, E is the rms value of the field given by Eq. (6.1). The units for

 are watts per square meter with E in volts per meter and ZW in
ohms. Because the E field is inversely proportional to distance (in this
case the radius of the sphere), the power density is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance.
6.6
The Isotropic Radiator and Antenna
Gain
The word isotropic means, rather loosely, equally in all directions.
Thus an isotropic radiator is one which radiates equally in all direc-
tions. No real antenna can radiate equally in all directions, and the
isotropic radiator is therefore hypothetical. It does, however, provide a
very useful theoretical standard against which real antennas can be
compared. Being hypothetical, it can be made 100 percent efficient,
meaning that it radiates all the power fed into it. Thus, referring back
to Fig. 6.1a, Prad  PS. By imagining the isotropic radiator to be at the
center of a sphere of radius r, the power flux density, which is the pow-
er flow through unit area, is

i 
(6.4)
Now the flux density from a real antenna will vary with direction,
but with most antennas a well-defined maximum occurs. The gain of
the antenna is the ratio of this maximum to that for the isotropic radi-
ator at the same radius r:
G 
(6.5)
A very closely related gain figure is the directivity. This differs from
the power gain only in that in determining the isotropic flux density,

the actual power Prad radiated by the real antenna is used, rather than
the power PS supplied to the antenna. These two values are related as
Prad  APS, where A is the antenna efficiency. Denoting the directivi-
ty by [SD] gives
G  A [SD]
Often, the directive gain is the parameter which can be calculated,
and the efficiency is assumed to be equal to unity so that the power
gain is also known. Note that A does not include feeder mismatch or
polarization losses, which are accounted for separately.
The gain as described is called the isotropic power gain, sometimes
denoted by Gi. The power gain of an antenna also may be referred to
some standard other than isotropic. For example, the gain of a reflec-
tor-type antenna may be made relative to the antenna illuminating
the reflector. Care must be taken therefore to know what reference
antenna is being used when gain is stated. The isotropic gain is the
most commonly used figure and will be assumed throughout this text
(without use of a subscript) unless otherwise noted.
6.7
Radiation Pattern
The radiation pattern shows how the gain of an antenna varies with
direction. Referring to Fig. 6.3, at a fixed distance r, the gain will vary
with  and  and may be written generally as G(, ). The radiation
pattern is the gain normalized to its maximum value. Denoting the
maximum value simply by G as before, the radiation pattern is
g (, ) 
(6.6)
The radiation pattern gives the directional properties of the
antenna normalized to the maximum value, in this case the maxi-
mum gain. The same function gives the power density normalized
to the maximum power density. For most satellite antennas, the
three-dimensional plot of the radiation pattern shows a well-
defined main lobe, as sketched in Fig. 6.6a. In this diagram, the
length of a radius line to any point on the surface of the lobe gives
the value of the radiation function at that point. It will be seen that
the maximum value is normalized to unity, and for convenience,
this is shown pointing along the positive z axis. Be very careful to
observe that axes shown in Fig. 6.6 do not represent distance. The
distance r is assumed to be fixed at some value in the far field.
What is shown is a plot of normalized gain as a function of angles 
and .

The main lobe represents a beam of radiation, and the beamwidth is
specified as the angle subtended by the 3-dB lines. Because in gener-
al the beam may not be symmetrical, it is usual practice to give the
beamwidth in the H plane (  0°), as shown in Fig. 6.6b, and in the E
plane (  90°), as shown in Fig. 6.6c.
Because the radiation pattern is defined in terms of radiated power,
the normalized electric field strength pattern will be given by g(, .

Beam Solid Angle and Directivity
Plane angles are measured in radians, and by definition, an arc of
length R equal to the radius subtends an angle of one radian at the cen-
ter of a circle. An angle of  radians defines an arc length of R on the
circle. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.7a. The circumference of a circle is
given by 2	R, and hence the total angle subtended at the center of a
circle is 2	 radians. All this should be familiar to the student. What
may not be so familiar is the concept of solid angle. A surface area of R2
on the surface of a sphere of radius R subtends unit solid angle at the
center of the sphere. This is shown in Fig. 6.7b. The unit for the solid
angle is the steradian. A solid angle of  steradians defines a surface
area on the sphere (a spherical cap) of R2. Looking at this another
way, a surface area A subtends a solid angle A/R2 at the center of the
sphere. Since the total surface area of a sphere of radius R is 4	R2, the
total solid angle subtended at the center of the sphere is 4	 steradians.

The radiation intensity is the power radiated per unit solid angle.
For a power Prad radiated, the average radiation intensity (which is
also the isotropic value) taken over a sphere is

From the definition of directivity , the maximum radiation intensity
is

The beam solid angle A for an actual antenna is defined as the solid
angle through which all the power would flow to produce a constant
radiation intensity equal to the maximum value. Thus
Umax 

Combining Eqs. (6.7), (6.8), and (6.9) yields the important result

This is important because for narrow-beam antennas such as used in
many satellite communications systems, a good approximation to the
solid angle is

(6.11)
where HPBWE is the half-power beamwidth in the E plane and HPB-
WH is the half-power beamwidth in the H plane, as shown in Fig. 6.6.
This equation requires the half-power beamwidths to be expressed in
radians, and the resulting solid angle is in steradians.
The usefulness of this relationship is that the half-power
beamwidths can be measured, and hence the directive gain can be
found. When the half-power beamwidths are expressed in degrees, the
equation for the directive gain becomes

radiation characteristics. A receiving antenna has directional proper-
ties also described by the radiation pattern, but in this case it refers to

the ratio of received power normalized to the maximum value.
An important concept used to describe the reception properties of an
antenna is that of effective aperture. Consider a TEM wave of a given
power density 
 at the receiving antenna. Let the load at the antenna
terminals be a complex conjugate match so that maximum power
transfer occurs and power Prec is delivered to the load. Note that the
power delivered to the actual receiver may be less than this as a result
of feeder losses. With the receiving antenna aligned for maximum
reception (including polarization alignment, which is described in
detail later), the received power will be proportional to the power den-
sity of the incoming wave. The constant of proportionality is the effec-
tive aperture Aeff which is defined by the equation
Prec  Aeff 
(6.13)
For antennas which have easily identified physical apertures, such
as horns and parabolic reflector types, the effective aperture is related
in a direct way to the physical aperture. If the wave could uniformly
illuminate the physical aperture, then this would be equal to the effec-
tive aperture. However, the presence of the antenna in the field of the
incoming wave alters the field distribution, thereby preventing uni-
form illumination. The effective aperture is smaller than the physical
aperture by a factor known as the illumination efficiency. Denoting the
illumination efficiency by I gives
Aeff  IAphysical
(6.14)
The illumination efficiency is usually a specified number, and it can
range between about 0.5 and 0.8. Of course, it cannot exceed unity, and
a conservative value often used in calculations is 0.55.
A fundamental relationship exists between the power gain of an
antenna and its effective aperture. This is

(6.15)
where  is the wavelength of the TEM wave, assumed sinusoidal (for
practical purposes, this will be the wavelength of the radio wave car-
rier). The importance of this equation is that the gain is normally the
known (measurable) quantity, but once this is known, the effective
aperture is also known.
6.10
The Half-Wave Dipole
The half-wave dipole is a basic antenna type which finds limited but
essential use in satellite communications. Some radiation occurs in all

directions except along the dipole axis itself, and it is this near-omni-
directional property which finds use for telemetry and command sig-
nals to and from the satellite, essential during the launch phase when
highly directional antennas cannot be deployed.
The half-wave dipole is shown in Fig. 6.8a, and its radiation pattern
in the xy plane and in any one meridian plane in Fig. 6.8b and c.
Because the phase velocity of the radio wave along the wire is some-
what less than the free-space velocity, the wavelength is also slightly
less, and the antenna is cut to about 95 percent of the free-space half-
wavelength. This tunes the antenna correctly to resonance. The main
properties of the half-wave dipole are
Impedance: 73 
Directivity: 1.64 (or 2.15 dB)
Effective aperture: 0.132
3-dB beamwidth: 78°
Assuming the antenna efficiency is unit (A  1), the power gain is also
1.64, or 2.15 dB, referred to an isotropic radiator.
As shown in Fig. 6.8b, the radiation is a maximum in the xy plane,
the normalized value being unity. The symmetry of the dipole means
that the radiation pattern in this plane is a circle of unit radius.
Symmetry also means that the pattern is the same for any plane con-
taining the dipole axis (the z axis). Thus the radiation pattern is a
function of  only and is given by
g () 
(6.16)
A plot of this function is shown in Fig. 6.8c. It is left as an exercise for
the student to show that the 3-dB beamwidth obtained from this pat-
tern is 78°.
When a satellite is launched, command and control signals must be
sent and received. In the launch phase, highly directional antennas
are not deployed, and a half-wave dipole, or one of its variants, is used
to maintain communications.
6.11
Aperture Antennas
The open end of a waveguide is an example of a simple aperture anten-
na. It is capable of radiating energy being carried by the guide, and it can
receive energy from a wave impinging on it. In satellite communications,
the most commonly encountered aperture antennas are horn antennas

and reflector antennas. Before describing some of the practical aspects of
these, the radiation pattern of an idealized aperture will be used to illus-
trate certain features which are important in satellite communications.
The idealized aperture is shown in Fig. 6.9. It consists of a rectan-
gular aperture of sides a and b cut in an infinite ground plane. A uni-
form electric field exists across the aperture parallel to the sides b, and
the aperture is centered on the coordinate system shown in Fig. 6.3,
with the electric field parallel to the y axis. Radiation from different
parts of the aperture adds constructively in some directions and
destructively in others, with the result that the radiation pattern
exhibits a main lobe and a number of sidelobes. Mathematically, this
is shown as follows: At some fixed distance r in the far-field region, the
electric field components described in Sec. 6.4 are given by
E (, )  C sin 
(6.17)
E (, )  C cos  cos 

Here, C is a constant which depends on the distance r, the length a and
b, the wavelength , and the electric field strength Eo. For present pur-
poses, it can be set equal to unity. X and Y are variables given by

The results of Example 6.1 show the main lobe and the sidelobes.
These are a general feature of aperture antennas, and as mentioned
above, the pattern is the result of interference phenomena.
Mathematically, the lobes result from the (sin X)/X and (sin Y)/Y
terms. One of the main concerns in satellite communications is the
reduction of interference caused by sidelobes.
The uniform field distribution assumed above cannot be realized in
practice, the actual distribution depending on the manner in which the
aperture is energized. In practice, therefore, the radiation pattern will
depend on the way the aperture is energized. It is also influenced by
the physical construction of the antenna. With reflector-type antennas,
for example, the position of the primary feed can change the pattern in
important ways.
Another important practical consideration with real antennas is the
cross-polarization which can occur. This refers to the antenna in the
transmit mode radiating, and in the receive mode responding to, an
unwanted signal with polarization orthogonal to the desired polariza-
tion (see Sec. 5.2). As mentioned in Chap. 5, frequency reuse makes use
of orthogonal polarization, and any unwanted cross-polarized compo-
nent will result in interference. The cross-polarization characteristics
of some practical antennas will be looked at in the following sections.
The aperture shown in Fig. 6.9 is linearly polarized, the E vector
being directed along the y axis. At some arbitrary point in the far-field
region, the wave will remain linearly polarized, the magnitude E being
given by Eq. (6.1). It is only necessary for the receiving antenna to be
oriented so that E induces maximum signal, with no component
orthogonal to E so that cross-polarization is absent. Care must be tak-
en, however, in how cross-polarization is defined. The linearly polar-
ized field E can be resolved into two vectors, one parallel to the plane
containing the aperture vector Eo, referred to as the copolar compo-
nent, and a second component orthogonal to this, referred to as the
cross-polarized component. The way in which these components are
used in antenna measurements is detailed in Chang (1989) and Rudge
et al. (1982).
6.12
Horn Antennas
The horn antenna is an example of an aperture antenna which pro-
vides a smooth transition from a waveguide to a larger aperture that
couples more effectively into space. Horn antennas are used directly as
radiators aboard satellites to illuminate comparatively large areas of
the earth, and they are also widely used as primary feeds for reflector-
type antennas both in transmitting and receiving modes. The three
most commonly used types of horns are illustrated in Fig. 6.10.

139
TLFeBOOK

Conical horn antennas. The smooth-walled conical antenna shown in
Fig. 6.10 is the simplest horn structure. The term smooth-walled
refers to the inside wall. The horn may be fed from a rectangular wave-
guide, but this requires a rectangular-to-circular transition at the
junction. Feeding from a circular guide is direct and is the preferred
method, with the guide operating in the TE11 mode. The conical horn
antenna may be used with linear or circular polarization, but in order
to illustrate some of the important features, linear polarization will be
assumed.
The electric field distribution at the horn mouth is sketched in Fig.
6.11 for vertical polarization. The curved field lines can be resolved into
vertical and horizontal components as shown. The TEM wave in the far
field is linearly polarized, but the horizontal components of the aper-
ture field give rise to cross-polarized waves in the far-field region.
Because of the symmetry, the cross-polarized waves cancel in the prin-
cipal planes (the E and H planes); however, they produce four peaks,
one in each quadrant around the main lobe. Referring to Fig. 6.5, the
cross-polarized fields peak in the   ±45° planes. The peaks are about
19 dB relative to the peak of the main (copolar) lobe (Olver, 1992).
The smooth-walled horn does not produce a symmetrical main
beam, even though the horn itself is symmetrical. The radiation pat-
terns are complicated functions of the horn dimensions. Details will be

found in Chang (1989), where it is shown that the beamwidths in the
principal planes can differ widely. This lack of symmetry is a disad-
vantage where global coverage is required.
By operating a conical horn is what is termed a hybrid mode, which
is a nonlinear combination of transverse electric (TE) and transverse
magnetic (TM) modes, the pattern symmetry is improved, the cross-
polarization is reduced, and a more efficient main beam is produced
with low sidelobes. It is especially important to reduce the cross-polar-
ization where frequency reuse is employed, as described in Sec. 5.2.
One method of achieving a hybrid mode is to corrugate the inside
wall of the horn, thus giving rise to the corrugated horn antenna. The
cross section of a corrugated horn is shown in Fig. 6.12a. The aperture
electric field is shown in Fig. 6.12b, where it is seen to have a much
lower cross-polarized component. This field distribution is sometimes

referred to as a scalar field and the horn as a scalar horn. A develop-
ment of the scalar horn is the scalar feed, Fig. 6.13, which can be seen
on most domestic receiving systems. Here, the flare angle of the horn
is 90°, and the corrugations are in the form of a flange surrounding the
circular waveguide. The corrugated horn is obviously more difficult to
make than the smooth-walled version, and close manufacturing toler-
ances must be maintained, especially in machining the slots or corru-
gations, all of which contribute to increased costs. A comprehensive
description of the corrugated horn will be found in Olver (1992), and
design details will be found in Chang (1989).
A hybrid mode also can be created by including a dielectric rod along
the axis of the smooth-walled horn, this being referred to as a dielec-
tric-rod-loaded antenna (see Miya, 1981).
A multimode horn is one which is excited by a linear combination of
transverse electric and transverse magnetic fields, the most common
type being the dual-mode horn, which combines the TE11 and TM11
modes. The advantages of the dual-mode horn are similar to those of the
hybrid-mode horn, that is, better main lobe symmetry, lower cross-polar-
ization, and a more efficient main beam with low widelobes. Dual-mode
horns have been installed aboard various satellites (see Miya, 1981).

Horns which are required to provide earth coverage from geosta-
tionary satellites must maintain low cross-polarization and high gain
over a cone angle of ±9°. This is achieved more simply and economi-
cally with dual-mode horns (Hwang, 1992).
Pyramidal horn antennas. The pyramidal horn antenna, illustrated in
Fig. 6.14, is primarily designed for linear polarization. In general, it
has a rectangular cross section a  b and operates in the TE10 wave-
guide mode, which has the electric field distribution shown in Fig. 6.14.
In general, the beamwidths for the pyramidal horn differ in the E and
H planes, but it is possible to choose the aperture dimensions to make
these equal. The pyramidal horn can be operated in horizontally and

vertically polarized modes simultaneously, giving rise to dual-linear
polarization. According to Chang (1989), the cross-polarization charac-
teristics of the pyramidal horn have not been studied to any great
extent, and if required, they should be measured.
For any of the aperture antennas discussed, the isotropic gain can
be found in terms of the area of the physical aperture by using the
relationships given in Eqs. (6.14) and (6.15). For accurate gain deter-
minations, the difficulties lie in determining the illumination efficien-
cy I, which can range from 35 to 80 percent for horns and from 50 to
80 percent for circular reflectors (Balanis, 1982, p. 475). Circular
reflectors are discussed in the next section.
6.13
The Parabolic Reflector
Parabolic reflectors are widely used in satellite communications sys-
tems to enhance the gain of antennas. The reflector provides a focus-
ing mechanism which concentrates the energy in a given direction.
The most commonly used form of parabolic reflector has a circular
aperture, as shown in Fig. 6.15. This is the type seen in many home
installations for the reception of TV signals. The circular aperture con-
figuration is referred to as a paraboloidal reflector.
The main property of the paraboloidal reflector is its focusing prop-
erty, normally associated with light, where parallel rays striking the
reflector converge on a single point known as the focus and, conversely,
rays originating at the focus are reflected as a parallel beam of light.

This is illustrated in Fig. 6.16. Light, of course, is a particular example
of an electromagnetic wave, and the same properties apply to electro-
magnetic waves in general, including the radio waves used in satellite
communications. The ray paths from the focus to the aperture plane
(the plane containing the circular aperture) are all equal in length.
The geometric properties of the paraboloidal reflector of interest
here are most easily demonstrated by means of the parabola, which is
the curve traced by the reflector on any plane normal to the aperture
plane and containing the focus. This is shown in Fig. 6.17a. The focal
point or focus is shown as S, the vertex as A, and the axis is the line
passing through S and A. SP is the focal distance for any point P and
SA the focal length, usually denoted by f. (The parabola is examined in
more detail in App. B). A ray path is shown as SPQ, where P is a point
on the curve and Q is a point in the aperture plane. Length PQ lies
parallel to the axis. For any point P, all path lengths SPQ are equal;
that is, the distance SP  PQ is a constant which applies for all such
paths. The path equality means that a wave originating from an
isotropic point source has a uniform phase distribution over the aper-
ture plane. This property, along with the parallel-beam property,
means that the wavefront is plane. Radiation from the paraboloidal
reflector appears to originate as a plane wave from the plane normal
to the axis and containing the directrix (see App. B). Although the
characteristics of the reflector antenna are more readily described in
terms of radiation, it should be kept in mind that the reciprocity theo-
rem makes these applicable to the receiving mode as well.
Now although there are near- and far-field components present in
the reflector region, the radio link is made through the far-field com-
ponent, and only this need be considered. For this, the reflected wave
is a plane wave, while the wave originating from the isotropic source
and striking the reflector has a spherical wavefront. The power densi-
ty in the plane wave is independent of distance. For the spherical
wave, the power density of the far-field component decreases in
inverse proportion to the distance squared, and therefore, the illumi-
nation at the edge of the reflector will be less than that at the vertex.

This gives rise to a nonuniform amplitude distribution across the aper-
ture plane, which in effect means that the illumination efficiency is
reduced. Denoting the focal distance by  and the focal length by f as

For satellite applications, a high illumination efficiency is desirable.
This requires that the radiation pattern of the primary antenna, which
is situated at the focus and which illuminates the reflector, should
approximate as closely as practical the inverse of the space attenua-
tion factor.
An important ratio is that of aperture diameter to focal length.
Denoting the diameter by D (do not confuse with the  used for direc-
tivity), then, as shown in App. B,
 0.25 cot 
(6.29)
The position of the focus in relation to the reflector for various values
of f/D is shown in Fig. 6.18. For f/D  0.25, the primary antenna lies in
the space between the reflector and the aperture plane, and the illumi-
nation tapers away toward the edge of the reflector. For f/D  0.25, the
primary antenna lies outside the aperture plane, which results in more
nearly uniform illumination, but spillover increases. In the transmit-
ting mode, spillover is the radiation from the primary antenna which is
directed toward the reflector but which lies outside the angle 2
0. In satellite applications, the primary antenna is usually a horn (or
an array of horns, as will be shown later) pointed toward the reflector.
In order to compensate for the space attenuation described above,
higher-order modes can be added to the horn feed so that the horn
radiation pattern approximates the inverse of the space attenuation
function (Chang, 1989).
The radiation from the horn will be a spherical wave, and the phase
center will be the center of curvature of the wavefront. When used as
the primary antenna for a parabolic reflector, the horn is positioned so
that the phase center lies on the focus.
The focal length can be given in terms of the depth of the reflector
and its diameter. It is sometimes useful to know the focal length for

The radiation pattern for the paraboloidal reflector is similar to that
developed in Example 6.1 for the rectangular aperture, in that there is
a main lobe and a number of sidelobes, although there will be differ-
ences in detail. In practice, the sidelobes are accounted for by an enve-
lope function as described in Chap. 13. Useful approximate formulas
for the half-power beamwidth and the beamwidth between the first
nulls (BWFN) are
HPBW70 
(6.33)
BWFN2HPBW
(6.34)
In these relationships, the beamwidths are given in degrees. The
paraboloidal antenna described so far is center-fed in that the primary
horn is pointed toward the center of the reflector. With this arrange-
ment the primary horn and its supports present a partial blockage to
the reflected wave. The energy scattered by the blockage is lost from
the main lobe, and it can create additional sidelobes. One solution is to
use an offset feed as described in the next section.
The wave from the primary radiator induces surface currents in the
reflector. The curvature of the reflector causes the currents to follow
curved paths so that both horizontal and vertical components are pre-
sent, even where the incident wave is linearly polarized in one or oth-
er of these directions. The situation is sketched for the case of vertical

polarization in Fig. 6.19. The resulting radiation consists of copolar-
ized and cross-polarized fields. The symmetry of the arrangement
means that the cross-polarized component is zero in the principal
planes (the E and H planes). Cross-polarization peaks in the   ± 45°

it illuminates only the upper portion of the reflector. The feed horn and
its support can be placed well clear of the main beam so that no block-
age occurs. With the center-fed arrangement described in the previous
section, the blockage results typically in a 10 percent reduction in effi-
ciency (Brain and Rudge, 1984) and increased radiation in the side-
lobes. The offset arrangement avoids this. Figure 6.21b shows a
development model of an offset antenna intended for use in the
European Olympus satellite.
The main disadvantages of the offset feed are that a stronger
mechanical support is required to maintain the reflector shape, and
because of the asymmetry, the cross-polarization with a linear polar-
ized feed is worse compared with the center-fed antenna. Polarization
compensation can be introduced into the primary feed to correct for the
cross-polarization, or a polarization-purifying grid can be incorporated
into the antenna structure (Brain and Rudge, 1984). The advantages
of the offset feed are sufficiently attractive for it to be standard on
many satellites (see, for example, Figs. 7.6 and 7.22). It is also used
with double-reflector earth station antennas, as shown in Fig. 6.24,
and is being used increasingly with small receive-only earth station
antennas.
6.15
Double-Reflector Antennas
With reflector-type antennas, the feeder connecting the feed horn to
the transmit/receive equipment must be kept as short as possible to
minimize losses. This is particularly important with large earth sta-
tions where the transmit power is large and where very low receiv-
er noise is required. The single-reflector system described in the
previous section does not lend itself very well to achieving this, and
more satisfactory, but more costly, arrangements are possible with a
double-reflector system. The feed horn is mounted at the rear of the
main reflector through an opening at the vertex, as illustrated in
Fig. 6.22. The rear mount makes for a compact feed, which is an
advantage where steerable antennas must be used, and access for
servicing is easier. The subreflector, which is mounted at the front of
the main reflector, is generally smaller than the feed horn and caus-
es less blockage. Two main types are in use, the Cassegrain antenna
and the Gregorian antenna, named after the astronomers who first
developed them.
Cassegrain antenna. The basic Cassegrain form consists of a main
paraboloid and a subreflector, which is a hyperboloid (see App. B). The
subreflector has two focal points, one of which is made to coincide with
that of the main reflector and the other with the phase center of the

feed horn, as shown in Fig. 6.23a. The Cassegrain system is equivalent
to a single paraboloidal reflector of focal length
fe 
(6.35)
where eh is the eccentricity of the hyperboloid (see App. B) and f is the
focal length of the main reflector. The eccentricity of the hyperboloid is
always greater than unity and typically ranges from about 1.4 to 3.
The equivalent focal length, therefore, is greater than the focal length
of the main reflector. The diameter of the equivalent paraboloid is the
same as that of the main reflector, and hence the f/D ratio is increased.
As shown in Fig. 6.18, a large f/D ratio leads to more uniform illumi-
nation, and in the case of the Cassegrain, this is achieved without the
spillover associated with the single-reflector system. The larger f/D
ratio also results in lower cross-polarization (Miya, 1981). The
Cassegrain system is widely used in large earth station installations.
Gregorian antenna.
The basic Gregorian form consists of a main
paraboloid and a subreflector, which is an ellipsoid (see App. B). As

with the hyperboloid, the subreflector has two focal points, one of
which is made to coincide with that of the main reflector and the
other with the phase center of the feed horn, as shown in Fig. 6.23b.
The performance of the Gregorian system is similar in many
respects to the Cassegrain. An offset Gregorian antenna is illustrat-
ed in Fig. 6.24.

Shaped Reflector Systems
With the double-reflector systems described, the illumination effi-
ciency of the main reflector can be increased while avoiding the prob-
lem of increased spillover by shaping the surfaces of the subreflector
and main reflector. With the Cassegrain system, for example, alter-
ing the curvature of the center section of the subreflector to be
greater than that of the hyperboloid allows it to reflect more energy
toward the edge of the main reflector, which makes the amplitude

distribution more uniform. At the same time, the curvature of the
center section of the main reflector is made smaller than that
required for the paraboloid. This compensates for the reduced path
length so that the constant phase condition across the aperture is
maintained. The edge of the subreflector surface is shaped in a man-
ner to reduce spillover, and of course, the overall design must take
into account the radiation pattern of the primary feed. The process,
referred to as reflector shaping, employs computer-aided design
methods. Further details will be found in Miya (1981) and Rusch
(1992).
With the Hughes shaped reflector (Fig. 6.25), dimples and/or rip-
ples are created on the surface. The depth of these is no more than
a wavelength, which makes them rather difficult to see, especially
at the Ka band. Reflections from the uneven surface reinforce radi-
ation in some directions and reduce it in others. The design steps
start with a map of the ground coverage area desired. A grid is over-
laid on the map, and at each grid intersection a weighting factor is
assigned which corresponds to the antenna gain desired in that
direction. The intersection points on the coverage area also can be
defined by the azimuth and elevation angles required at the ground
stations, which enables the beam contour to be determined. The
beam-shaping stage starts by selecting a smooth parabolic reflector
that forms an elliptical beam encompassing the coverage area. The
reflector surface is computer modeled as a series of mathematical
functions which are changed or perturbed until the model produces
the desired coverage. On a first pass the computer analyzes the per-
turbations and translates these into surface ripples. The beam foot-
print computed for the rippled surface is compared with the
coverage area. The perturbation analysis is refined and the passes
are repeated until a satisfactory match is obtained. As an example
of the improvements obtained, the conventional approach to pro-
ducing a CONUS beam requires 56 feed horns, and the feed weighs
84 pounds and has a 1-dB loss. With a shaped reflector, a single feed
horn is used, and it weighs 14 pounds and has 0.3-dB loss (see
Vectors, 1993).
Shaped reflectors also have been used to compensate for rainfall
attenuation, and this has particular application in direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) systems (see Chap. 16). In this case, the reflector
design is based on a map similar to that shown in Fig. 16.8, which
gives the rainfall intensity as a function of latitude and longitude. The
attenuation resulting from the rainfall is calculated as shown in Sec.
4.4, and the reflector is shaped to redistribute the radiated power to
match, within practical limits, the attenuation.

Arrays
Beam shaping can be achieved by using an array of basic elements.
The elements are arranged so that their radiation patterns provide
mutual reinforcement in certain directions and cancellation in others.
Although most arrays used in satellite communications are two-
dimensional horn arrays, the principle is most easily explained with
reference to an in-line array of dipoles (Fig. 6.26a and b). As shown
previously (Fig. 6.8), the radiation pattern for a single dipole in the xy
plane is circular, and it is this aspect of the radiation pattern that is
altered by the array configuration. Two factors contribute to this: the
difference in distance from each element to some point in the far field
and the difference in the current feed to each element. For the coordi-
nate system shown in Fig. 6.26b, the xy plane, the difference in dis-
tance is given by s cos . Although this distance is small compared with
the range between the array and point P, it plays a crucial role in
determining the phase relationships between the radiation from each
element. It should be kept in mind that at any point in the far field the
array appears as a point source, the situation being as sketched in Fig.
6.26c. For this analysis, the point P is taken to lie in the xy plane.
Since a distance of one wavelength corresponds to a phase difference
of 2	, the phase lead of element n relative to n  1 resulting from the
difference in distance is (2	/)s cos . To illustrate the array princi-
ples, it will be assumed that each element is fed by currents of equal
magnitude but differing in phase progressively by some angle .
Positive values of  mean a phase lead and negative values a phase
lag. The total phase lead of element n relative to n  1 is therefore
  

(6.36)
The Argand diagram for the phasors is shown in Fig. 6.27. The mag-
nitude of the resultant phasor can be found by first resolving the indi-
vidual phasors into horizontal (real axis) and vertical (imaginary axis)
components, adding these, and finding the resultant. Mathematically,

Here, N is the total number of elements in the array. A single element

As these examples show, the current phasing controls the position of
the main lobe, and a continuous variation of current can be used to
produce a scanning array. With the simple dipole array, the shape of
the beam changes drastically with changes in the current phasing, and
in practical scanning arrays, steps are taken to avoid this. A detailed
discussion of arrays will be found in Kummer (1992).
Arrays may be used directly as antennas, and details of a nine-horn
array used to provide an earth coverage beam are given in Hwang
(1992). Arrays are also used as feeders for reflector antennas, and such
a horn array is shown in Fig. 6.28.

The Space Segment
7.1
Introduction
A satellite communications system can be broadly divided into two seg-
ments, a ground segment and a space segment. The space segment will
obviously include the satellites, but it also includes the ground facili-
ties needed to keep the satellites operational, these being referred to
as the tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) facilities. In many
networks it is common practice to employ a ground station solely for
the purpose of TT&C.
The equipment carried aboard the satellite also can be classified
according to function. The payload refers to the equipment used to pro-
vide the service for which the satellite has been launched. The bus
refers not only to the vehicle which carries the payload but also to the
various subsystems which provide the power, attitude control, orbital
control, thermal control, and command and telemetry functions
required to service the payload.
In a communications satellite, the equipment which provides the
connecting link between the satellite’s transmit and receive antennas
is referred to as the transponder. The transponder forms one of the
main sections of the payload, the other being the antenna subsystems.
In this chapter the main characteristics of certain bus systems and
payloads are described.
7.2
The Power Supply
The primary electrical power for operating the electronic equipment is
obtained from solar cells. Individual cells can generate only small
amounts of power, and therefore, arrays of cells in series-parallel con-
nection are required. Figure 7.1 shows the solar cell panels for the HS

376 satellite manufactured by Hughes Space and Communications
Company. The spacecraft is 216 cm in diameter and 660 cm long when
fully deployed in orbit. During the launch sequence, the outer cylinder
is telescoped over the inner one, to reduce the overall length. Only the
outer panel generates electrical power during this phase. In geostation-
ary orbit the telescoped panel is fully extended so that both are exposed
to sunlight. At the beginning of life, the panels produce 940 W dc pow-
er, which may drop to 760 W at the end of 10 years. During eclipse, pow-
er is provided by two nickel-cadmium long-life batteries, which will
deliver 830 W. At the end of life, battery recharge time is less than 16 h.
The HS 376 spacecraft is a spin-stabilized spacecraft (the gyroscopic
effect of the spin is used for mechanical orientational stability, as

described in Sec. 7.3). Thus the arrays are only partially in sunshine
at any given time, which places a limitation on power.
Higher powers can be achieved with solar panels arranged in the
form of rectangular solar sails. Solar sails must be folded during 
the launch phase and extended when in geostationary orbit. Figure 7.2
shows the HS 601 satellite manufactured by Hughes Space and
Communications Company. As shown, the solar sails are folded up on
each side, and when fully extended, they stretch to 67 ft (316.5 cm)
from tip to tip. The full complement of solar cells is exposed to the sun-
light, and the sails are arranged to rotate to track the sun, so they are
capable of greater power output than cylindrical arrays having a com-
parable number of cells. The HS 601 can be designed to provide dc

power from 2 to 6 kW. In comparing the power capacity of cylindrical
and solar-sail satellites, the crossover point is estimated to be about 2
kW, where the solar-sail type is more economical than the cylindrical
type (Hyndman, 1991).
As discussed in Sec. 3.6, the earth will eclipse a geostationary satel-
lite twice a year, during the spring and autumnal equinoxes. Daily
eclipses start approximately 23 days before and end approximately 23
days after the equinox for both the spring and autumnal equinoxes
and can last up to 72 min at the actual equinox days. Figure 7.3 shows
the graph relating eclipse period to the day of year. In order to main-
tain service during an eclipse, storage batteries must be provided.
Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries continue to be used, as shown in the
Hughes HS 376 satellite, but developments in nickel-hydrogen (Ni-H2)
batteries offer significant improvement in power-weight ratio. Nickel-
hydrogen batteries are used in the Hughes HS 601 and in the Intelsat
VI (Pilcher, 1982) and Intelsat VII (Lilly, 1990) satellites.
7.3
Attitude Control
The attitude of a satellite refers to its orientation in space. Much of the
equipment carried aboard a satellite is there for the purpose of con-
trolling its attitude. Attitude control is necessary, for example, to

TLFeBOOK

ensure that directional antennas point in the proper directions. In the
case of earth environmental satellites, the earth-sensing instruments
must cover the required regions of the earth, which also requires atti-
tude control. A number of forces, referred to as disturbance torques,
can alter the attitude, some examples being the gravitational fields of
the earth and the moon, solar radiation, and meteorite impacts.
Attitude control must not be confused with station keeping, which is
the term used for maintaining a satellite in its correct orbital position,
although the two are closely related.
To exercise attitude control, there must be available some measure of
a satellite’s orientation in space and of any tendency for this to shift. In
one method, infrared sensors, referred to as horizon detectors, are used
to detect the rim of the earth against the background of space. With the
use of four such sensors, one for each quadrant, the center of the earth
can be readily established as a reference point. Any shift in orientation
is detected by one or other of the sensors, and a corresponding control
signal is generated which activates a restoring torque.
Usually, the attitude-control process takes place aboard the satel-
lite, but it is also possible for control signals to be transmitted from
earth, based on attitude data obtained from the satellite. Also, where
a shift in attitude is desired, an attitude maneuver is executed. The
control signals needed to achieve this maneuver may be transmitted
from an earth station.
Controlling torques may be generated in a number of ways. Passive
attitude control refers to the use of mechanisms which stabilize the
satellite without putting a drain on the satellite’s energy supplies; at
most, infrequent use is made of these supplies, for example, when
thruster jets are impulsed to provide corrective torque. Examples of
passive attitude control are spin stabilization and gravity gradient sta-
bilization. The latter depends on the interaction of the satellite with
the gravitational field of the central body and has been used, for exam-
ple, with the Radio Astronomy Explorer-2 satellite which was placed
in orbit around the moon (Wertz, 1984). For communications satellites,
spin stabilization is often used, and this is described in more detail in
Sec. 7.3.1.
The other form of attitude control is active control. With active atti-
tude control, there is no overall stabilizing torque present to resist the
disturbance torques. Instead, corrective torques are applied as
required in response to disturbance torques. Methods used to generate
active control torques include momentum wheels, electromagnetic
coils, and mass expulsion devices such as gas jets and ion thrusters.
The electromagnetic coil works on the principle that the earth’s mag-
netic field exerts a torque on a current-carrying coil and that this
torque can be controlled through control of the current. However, the
The Space Segment
171
TLFeBOOK

method is of use only for satellites relatively close to the earth. The use
of momentum wheels is described in more detail in Sec. 7.3.2.
The three axes which define a satellite’s attitude are its roll, pitch,
and yaw (RPY) axes. These are shown relative to the earth in Fig. 7.4.
All three axes pass through the center of gravity of the satellite. For
an equatorial orbit, movement of the satellite about the roll axis moves
the antenna footprint north and south; movement about the pitch axis
moves the footprint east and west; and movement about the yaw axis
rotates the antenna footprint.
7.3.1
Spinning satellite stabilization
Spin stabilization may be achieved with cylindrical satellites. The
satellite is constructed so that it is mechanically balanced about one
particular axis and is then set spinning around this axis. For geosta-
tionary satellites, the spin axis is adjusted to be parallel to the N-S
axis of the earth, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5. Spin rate is typically in the
range of 50 to 100 rev/min. Spin is initiated during the launch phase
by means of small gas jets.
In the absence of disturbance torques, the spinning satellite would
maintain its correct attitude relative to the earth. Disturbance
torques are generated in a number of ways, both external and inter-
nal to the satellite. Solar radiation, gravitational gradients, and mete-
orite impacts are all examples of external forces which can give rise
to disturbance torques. Motor-bearing friction and the movement of

ter, the pitch axis is normal to the orbital plane, and the roll axis is perpendicular to the
other two. (b) RPY axes for the geostationary orbit. Here, the roll axis is tangential to
the orbit and lies along the satellite velocity vector.
TLFeBOOK

satellite elements such as the antennas also can give rise to distur-
bance torques. The overall effect is that the spin rate will decrease,
and the direction of the angular spin axis will change. Impulse-type
thrusters, or jets, can be used to increase the spin rate again and to
shift the axis back to its correct N-S orientation. Nutation, which is a
form of wobbling, can occur as a result of the disturbance torques
and/or from misalignment or unbalance of the control jets. This nuta-
tion must be damped out by means of energy absorbers known as
nutation dampers.
Where an omnidirectional antenna is used (e.g., as shown for the
INTELSAT I and II satellites in Fig. 1.1), the antenna, which points
along the pitch axis, also rotates with the satellite. Where a directional
antenna is used, which is more common for communications satellites,
the antenna must be despun, giving rise to a dual-spin construction. An
electric motor drive is used for despinning the antenna subsystem.
Figure 7.6 shows the Hughes HS 376 satellite in more detail. The
antenna subsystem consists of a parabolic reflector and feed horns
mounted on the despun shelf, which also carries the communications
repeaters (transponders). The antenna feeds can therefore be connect-
ed directly to the transponders without the need for radiofrequency (rf)
rotary joints, while the complete platform is despun. Of course, control
signals and power must be transferred to the despun section, and a
mechanical bearing must be provided. The complete assembly for this
is known as the bearing and power transfer assembly (BAPTA). Figure
7.7 shows a photograph of the internal structure of the HS 376.
Certain dual-spin spacecraft obtain spin stabilization from a spin-
ning flywheel rather than by spinning the satellite itself. These fly-
wheels are termed momentum wheels, and their average momentum is
referred to as momentum bias. Reaction wheels, described in the next
section, operate at zero momentum bias.

7.3.2
Momentum wheel stabilization
In the previous section the gyroscopic effect of a spinning satellite was
shown to provide stability for the satellite attitude. Stability also can
be achieved by utilizing the gyroscopic effect of a spinning flywheel,
and this approach is used in noncylindrical satellites such as the
INTELSAT V type satellites shown in Fig. 1.1 and the Anik-E satel-
lites (Sec. 7.10). The complete unit, termed a momentum wheel, con-
sists of a flywheel, the bearing assembly, the casing, and an electric
drive motor with associated electronic control circuitry. The flywheel is
attached to the rotor, which consists of a permanent magnet providing
the magnetic field for motor action. The stator of the motor is attached

to the body of the satellite. Thus the motor provides the coupling
between the flywheel and the satellite structure. Speed and torque
control of the motor is exercised through the currents fed to the stator.
The housing for the momentum wheel is evacuated to protect the
wheel from adverse environmental effects, and the bearings have con-
trolled lubrication that lasts over the lifetime of the satellite. TELDIX
manufactures momentum wheels ranging in size from 20, 26, 35, 50,
to 60 cm in diameter that are used in a wide variety of satellites.
Details of these will be found in Chetty (1991).

The term momentum wheel is usually reserved for wheels that oper-
ate at nonzero momentum. This is termed a momentum bias. Such a
wheel provides passive stabilization for the yaw and roll axes when the
axis of rotation of the wheel lies along the pitch axis, as shown in Fig.
7.8a. Control about the pitch axis is achieved by changing the speed of
the wheel.
When a momentum wheel is operated with zero momentum bias, it
is generally referred to as a reaction wheel. Reaction wheels are used
in three-axis stabilized systems. Here, as the name suggests, each axis
is stabilized by a reaction wheel, as shown in Fig. 7.8c. Reaction

TLFeBOOK

wheels also can be combined with a momentum wheel to provide the
control needed (Chetty, 1991). Random and cyclic disturbance torques
tend to produce zero momentum on average. However, there will
always be some disturbance torques which cause a cumulative
increase in wheel momentum, and eventually at some point the wheel
saturates. In effect, it reaches its maximum allowable angular velocity
and can no longer take in any more momentum. Mass expulsion
devices are then used to unload the wheel, that is, remove momentum
from it (in the same way a brake removes energy from a moving vehi-
cle). Of course, operation of the mass expulsion devices consumes part
of the satellite’s fuel supply.
7.4
Station Keeping
In addition to having its attitude controlled, it is important that a geo-
stationary satellite be kept in its correct orbital slot. As described in
Sec. 2.8.1, the equatorial ellipticity of the earth causes geostationary
satellites to drift slowly along the orbit, to one of two stable points, at
75°E and 105°W. To counter this drift, an oppositely directed velocity
component is imparted to the satellite by means of jets, which are
pulsed once every 2 or 3 weeks. This results in the satellite drifting
back through its nominal station position, coming to a stop, and recom-
mencing the drift along the orbit until the jets are pulsed once again.
These maneuvers are termed east-west station-keeping maneuvers.
Satellites in the 6/4-GHz band must be kept within ±0.1° of the desig-
nated longitude, and in the 14/12-GHz band, within ±0.05°.
A satellite which is nominally geostationary also will drift in latitude,
the main perturbing forces being the gravitational pull of the sun and
the moon. These forces cause the inclination to change at a rate of
about 0.85°/year. If left uncorrected, the drift would result in a cyclic
change in the inclination, going from 0 to 14.67° in 26.6 years (Spilker,
1977) and back to zero, at which the cycle is repeated. To prevent the
shift in inclination from exceeding specified limits, jets may be pulsed
at the appropriate time to return the inclination to zero. Counteracting
jets must be pulsed when the inclination is at zero to halt the change
in inclination. These maneuvers are termed north-south station-keep-
ing maneuvers, and they are much more expensive in fuel than are
east-west station-keeping maneuvers. The north-south station-keeping
tolerances are the same as those for east-west station keeping, ±0.1° in
the C band and ±0.05° in the Ku band.
Orbital correction is carried out by command from the TT&C earth
station, which monitors the satellite position. East-west and north-
south station-keeping maneuvers are usually carried out using the
same thrusters as are used for attitude control. Figure 7.9 shows
The Space Segment
177

typical latitude and longitude variations for the Canadian Anik-C3
satellite which remain after station-keeping corrections are applied.
Satellite altitude also will show variations of about ±0.1 percent of
the nominal geostationary height. If, for sake of argument, this is
taken as 36,000 km, the total variation in the height is 72 km. A C-
band satellite therefore can be anywhere within a box bound by this
height and the ±0.1°
tolerances on latitude and longitude.
Approximating the geostationary radius as 42,164 km (see Sec. 3.1),
an angle of 0.2° subtends an arc of approximately 147 km. Thus both
the latitude and longitude sides of the box are 147 km. The situation
is sketched in Fig. 7.10, which also shows the relative beamwidths of
a 30-m and a 5-m antenna. As shown by Eq. (6.33), the 3-dB
beamwidth of a 30-m antenna is about 0.12°, and of a 5-m antenna,
about 0.7° at 6 GHz. Assuming 38,000 km (typical) for the slant
range, the diameter of the 30-m beam at the satellite will be about 80
km. This beam does not encompass the whole of the box and there-
fore could miss the satellite. Such narrow-beam antennas therefore
must track the satellite.
178

TLFeBOOK

The diameter of the 5-m antenna beam at the satellite will be about
464 km, and this does encompass the box, so tracking is not required.
The positional uncertainty of the satellite also introduces an uncer-
tainty in propagation time, which can be a significant factor in certain
types of communications networks.
By placing the satellite in an inclined orbit, the north-south station-
keeping maneuvers may be dispensed with. The savings in weight
achieved by not having to carry fuel for these maneuvers allows the
communications payload to be increased. The satellite is placed in an
inclined orbit of about 2.5 to 3°, in the opposite sense to that produced
by drift. Over a period of about half the predicted lifetime of the mis-
sion, the orbit will change to equatorial and then continue to increase
in inclination. However, this arrangement requires the use of tracking
antennas at the ground stations.
7.5
Thermal Control
Satellites are subject to large thermal gradients, receiving the sun’s
radiation on one side while the other side faces into space. In addi-
tion, thermal radiation from the earth and the earth’s albedo, which
is the fraction of the radiation falling on earth which is reflected,

limits for a satellite in geostationary orbit in relation to

TLFeBOOK

can be significant for low-altitude earth-orbiting satellites,
although it is negligible for geostationary satellites. Equipment in
the satellite also generates heat which has to be removed. The most
important consideration is that the satellite’s equipment should
operate as nearly as possible in a stable temperature environment.
Various steps are taken to achieve this. Thermal blankets and
shields may be used to provide insulation. Radiation mirrors are
often used to remove heat from the communications payload. The
mirrored thermal radiator for the Hughes HS 376 satellite can be
seen in Fig. 7.1 and in Fig. 7.6. These mirrored drums surround the
communications equipment shelves in each case and provide good
radiation paths for the generated heat to escape into the surround-
ing space. One advantage of spinning satellites compared with
body-stabilized is that the spinning body provides an averaging of
the temperature extremes experienced from solar flux and the cold
background of deep space.
In order to maintain constant temperature conditions, heaters may
be switched on (usually on command from ground) to make up for the
heat reduction which occurs when transponders are switched off. In
INTELSAT VI, heaters are used to maintain propulsion thrusters and
line temperatures (Pilcher, 1982).
7.6
TT&C Subsystem
The telemetry, tracking, and command subsystem performs several
routine functions aboard the spacecraft. The telemetry, or telemeter-
ing, function could be interpreted as measurement at a distance.
Specifically, it refers to the overall operation of generating an elec-
trical signal proportional to the quantity being measured and encod-
ing and transmitting this to a distant station, which for the satellite
is one of the earth stations. Data which are transmitted as telemetry
signals include attitude information such as that obtained from sun
and earth sensors; environmental information such as the magnetic
field intensity and direction, the frequency of meteorite impact, and
so on; and spacecraft information such as temperatures, power sup-
ply voltages, and stored-fuel pressure. Certain frequencies have been
designated by international agreement for satellite telemetry trans-
missions. During the transfer and drift orbital phases of the satellite
launch, a special channel is used along with an omnidirectional
antenna. Once the satellite is on station, one of the normal commu-
nications transponders may be used along with its directional anten-
na, unless some emergency arises which makes it necessary to switch
back to the special channel used during the transfer orbit.
180
Chapter Seven 
TLFeBOOK

Telemetry and command may be thought of as complementary
functions. The telemetry subsystem transmits information about the
satellite to the earth station, while the command subsystem receives
command signals from the earth station, often in response to teleme-
tered information. The command subsystem demodulates and, if nec-
essary, decodes the command signals and routes these to the
appropriate equipment needed to execute the necessary action. Thus
attitude changes may be made, communication transponders
switched in and out of circuits, antennas redirected, and station-
keeping maneuvers carried out on command. It is clearly important
to prevent unauthorized commands from being received and decoded,
and for this reason, the command signals are often encrypted.
Encrypt is derived from a Greek word kryptein, meaning to hide, and
represents the process of concealing the command signals in a secure
code. This differs from the normal process of encoding, which is one
of converting characters in the command signal into a code suitable
for transmission.
Tracking of the satellite is accomplished by having the satellite
transmit beacon signals which are received at the TT&C earth sta-
tions. Tracking is obviously important during the transfer and drift
orbital phases of the satellite launch. Once it is on station, the posi-
tion of a geostationary satellite will tend to be shifted as a result of
the various disturbing forces, as described previously. Therefore, it is
necessary to be able to track the satellite’s movement and send cor-
rection signals as required. Tracking beacons may be transmitted in
the telemetry channel, or by pilot carriers at frequencies in one of the
main communications channels, or by special tracking antennas.
Satellite range from the ground station is also required from time to
time. This can be determined by measurement of the propagation
delay of signals especially transmitted for ranging purposes.
It is clear that the telemetry, tracking, and command functions are
complex operations which require special ground facilities in addition
to the TT&C subsystems aboard the satellite. Figure 7.11 shows in
block diagram form the TT&C facilities used by Canadian Telesat for
its satellites.
7.7
Transponders
A transponder is the series of interconnected units which forms a sin-
gle communications channel between the receive and transmit anten-
nas in a communications satellite. Some of the units utilized by a
transponder in a given channel may be common to a number of
transponders. Thus, although reference may be made to a specific
The Space Segment
181
TLFeBOOK

transponder, this must be thought of as an equipment channel rather
than a single item of equipment.
Before describing in detail the various units of a transponder, the
overall frequency arrangement of a typical C-band communications
satellite will be examined briefly. The bandwidth allocated for C-
band service is 500 MHz, and this is divided into subbands, one for
each transponder. A typical transponder bandwidth is 36 MHz, and
allowing for a 4-MHz guardband between transponders, 12 such
transponders can be accommodated in the 500-MHz bandwidth. By
making use of polarization isolation, this number can be doubled.
Polarization isolation refers to the fact that carriers, which may be
on the same frequency but with opposite senses of polarization, can
be isolated from one another by receiving antennas matched to the
incoming polarization. With linear polarization, vertically and hori-
zontally polarized carriers can be separated in this way, and with cir-
cular polarization, left-hand circular and right-hand circular
182

polarizations can be separated. Because the carriers with opposite
senses of polarization may overlap in frequency, this technique is
referred to as frequency reuse. Figure 7.12 shows part of the frequency
and polarization plan for a C-band communications satellite.
Frequency reuse also may be achieved with spot-beam antennas,
and these may be combined with polarization reuse to provide an effec-
tive bandwidth of 2000 MHz from the actual bandwidth of 500 MHz.
For one of the polarization groups, Fig. 7.13 shows the channeling
scheme for the 12 transponders in more detail. The incoming, or uplink,
frequency range is 5.925 to 6.425 GHz. The carriers may be received on
one or more antennas, all having the same polarization. The input fil-
ter passes the full 500-MHz band to the common receiver while reject-
ing out-of-band noise and interference such as might be caused by
image signals. There will be many modulated carriers within this 500-
MHz passband, and all of these are amplified and frequency-converted
in the common receiver. The frequency conversion shifts the carriers to
the downlink frequency band, which is also 500 MHz wide, extending
from 3.7 to 4.2 GHz. At this point the signals are channelized into fre-
quency bands which represent the individual transponder bandwidths.
A commonly used value is 36 MHz for each transponder, which along
with 4-MHz guard bands between channels allows the 500 MHz avail-
able bandwidth to accommodate 12 transponder channels. A transpon-
der may handle one modulated carrier such as a TV signal, or it may
handle a number of separate carriers simultaneously, each modulated
by its own telephony or other baseband channel.

switched in. The combination is referred to as a redundant receiver,
meaning that although two are provided, only one is in use at a given
time.
The first stage in the receiver is a low-noise amplifier (LNA). This
amplifier adds little noise to the carrier being amplified, and at the
same time it provides sufficient amplification for the carrier to over-
ride the higher noise level present in the following mixer stage. In cal-
culations involving noise, it is usually more convenient to refer all
noise levels to the LNA input, where the total receiver noise may be
expressed in terms of an equivalent noise temperature. In a well-
designed receiver, the equivalent noise temperature referred to the
LNA input is basically that of the LNA alone. The overall noise tem-
perature must take into account the noise added from the antenna,
and these calculations are presented in detail in Chap. 12. The equiv-
alent noise temperature of a satellite receiver may be on the order of a
few hundred kelvins.
The LNA feeds into a mixer stage, which also requires a local oscil-
lator signal for the frequency-conversion process. The power drive from
the local oscillator to the mixer input is about 10 dBm. The oscillator

frequency must be highly stable and have low phase noise. A second
amplifier follows the mixer stage to provide an overall receiver gain of
about 60 dB. The signal levels in decibels referred to the input are
shown in Fig. 7.14 (CCIR, 1984). Splitting the gain between the pre-
amplifier at 6 GHz and the second amplifier at 4 GHz prevents oscil-
lation which might occur if all the gain were to be provided at the same
frequency.
The wideband receiver utilizes only solid-state active devices. In
some designs, tunnel-diode amplifiers have been used for the pream-
plifier at 6 GHz in 6/4-GHz transponders and for the parametric
amplifiers at 14 GHz in 14/12-GHz transponders. With advances in
field-effect transistor (FET) technology, FET amplifiers which offer
equal or better performance are now available for both bands. Diode
mixer stages are used. The amplifier following the mixer may utilize
bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) at 4 GHz and FETs at 12 GHz, or
FETs may in fact be used in both bands.
7.7.2
The input demultiplexer
The input demultiplexer separates the broadband input, covering the
frequency range 3.7 to 4.2 GHz, into the transponder frequency chan-
nels. Referring to Fig. 7.13, for example, the separate channels labeled
1 through 12 are shown in more detail in Fig. 7.15. The channels are
usually arranged in even-numbered and odd-numbered groups. This
provides greater frequency separation between adjacent channels in a
group, which reduces adjacent channel interference. The output from
the receiver is fed to a power splitter, which in turn feeds the two sep-
arate chains of circulators. The full broadband signal is transmitted
along each chain, and the channelizing is achieved by means of chan-
nel filters connected to each circulator, as shown in Fig. 7.15. The
channel numbers correspond to those shown in Fig. 7.13. Each filter
has a bandwidth of 36 MHz and is tuned to the appropriate center fre-
quency, as shown in Fig. 7.13. Although there are considerable losses
in the demultiplexer, these are easily made up in the overall gain for
the transponder channels.
7.7.3
The power amplifier
A separate power amplifier provides the output power for each transpon-
der channel. As shown in Fig. 7.16, each power amplifier is preceded by
an input attenuator. This is necessary to permit the input drive to each
power amplifier to be adjusted to the desired level. The attenuator has a
fixed section and a variable section. The fixed attenuation is needed to
balance out variations in the input attenuation so that each transponder
channel has the same nominal attenuation, the necessary adjustments

being made during assembly. The variable attenuation is needed to set
the level as required for different types of service (an example being the
requirement for input power backoff discussed below). Because this vari-
able attenuator adjustment is an operational requirement, it must be
under the control of the ground TT&C station.
Traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) are widely used in
transponders to provide the final output power required to the trans-
mit antenna. Figure 7.17 shows the schematic of a traveling wave tube
(TWT) and its power supplies. In the TWT, an electron-beam gun
assembly consisting of a heater, a cathode, and focusing electrodes is
used to form an electron beam. A magnetic field is required to confine
the beam to travel along the inside of a wire helix. For high-power
tubes such as might be used in ground stations, the magnetic field can
be provided by means of a solenoid and dc power supply. The compar-
atively large size and high power consumption of solenoids make them
unsuitable for use aboard satellites, and lower-power TWTs are used
which employ permanent-magnet focusing.
The rf signal to be amplified is coupled into the helix at the end
nearest the cathode and sets up a traveling wave along the helix. The
electric field of the wave will have a component along the axis of 
the helix. In some regions, this field will decelerate the electrons in the
beam, and in others it will accelerate them so that electron bunching
occurs along the beam. The average beam velocity, which is deter-
mined by the dc potential on the tube collector, is kept slightly greater
than the phase velocity of the wave along the helix. Under these con-
ditions, an energy transfer takes place, kinetic energy in the beam
being converted to potential energy in the wave. The wave actually
will travel around the helical path at close to the speed of light, but it
is the axial component of wave velocity which interacts with the elec-
tron beam. This component is less than the velocity of light approxi-
mately in the ratio of helix pitch to circumference. Because of this
effective reduction in phase velocity, the helix is referred to as a slow-
wave structure.
The advantage of the TWT over other types of tube amplifiers is that
it can provide amplification over a very wide bandwidth. Input levels
to the TWT must be carefully controlled, however, to minimize the
effects of certain forms of distortion. The worst of these results from
the nonlinear transfer characteristic of the TWT, illustrated in Fig.
7.18. At low input powers, the output-input power relationship is lin-
ear; that is, a given decibel change in input power will produce the
same decibel change in output power. At higher power inputs, the out-
put power saturates, the point of maximum power output being known
as the saturation point. The saturation point is a very convenient ref-
erence point, and input and output quantities are usually referred to

it. The linear region of the TWT is defined as the region bound by the
thermal noise limit at the low end and by what is termed the 1-dB
compression point at the upper end. This is the point where the actu-
al transfer curve drops 1 dB below the extrapolated straight line, as
shown in Fig. 7.18. The selection of the operating point on the trans-
fer characteristic will be considered in more detail shortly, but first the
phase characteristics will be described.
The absolute time delay between input and output signals at a fixed
input level is generally not significant. However, at higher input lev-
els, where more of the beam energy is converted to output power, the
average beam velocity is reduced, and therefore, the delay time is
increased. Since phase delay is directly proportional to time delay, this
results in a phase shift which varies with input level. Denoting the
phase shift at saturation by S and in general by , the phase differ-
ence relative to saturation is   S. This is plotted in Fig. 7.19 as a
function of input power. Thus, if the input signal power level changes,
phase modulation will result, this being termed AM/PM conversion.
The slope of the phase shift characteristic gives the phase modulation
coefficient, in degrees per decibel. The curve of the slope as a function
of input power is also sketched in Fig. 7.19.
Frequency modulation (FM) is usually employed in analog satellite
communications circuits. However, unwanted amplitude modulation
(AM) can occur from the filtering which takes place prior to the TWT
input. The AM process converts the unwanted amplitude modulation
to phase modulation (PM), which appears as noise on the FM carrier.
Where only a single carrier is present, it may be passed through a

TLFeBOOK

hard limiter before being amplified in the TWT. The hard limiter is a
circuit which clips the carrier amplitude close to the zero baseline to
remove any amplitude modulation. The frequency modulation is pre-
served in the zero crossover points and is not affected by the limiting.
A TWT also may be called on to amplify two or more carriers simul-
taneously, this being referred to as multicarrier operation. The AM/PM
conversion is then a complicated function of carrier amplitudes, but in
addition, the nonlinear transfer characteristic introduces a more seri-
ous form of distortion known as intermodulation distortion. The non-
linear transfer characteristic may be expressed as a Taylor series
expansion which relates input and output voltages:
eo  aei  bei
2  cei
3  . . .
(7.1)
Here, a, b, c, etc. are coefficients which depend on the transfer char-
acteristic, eo is the output voltage, and ei is the input voltage, which
consists of the sum of the individual carriers. The third-order term is
cei3. This and higher-order odd-power terms give rise to intermodula-
tion products, but usually only the third-order contribution is signifi-
cant. Suppose multiple carriers are present, separated from one
another by "f, as shown in Fig. 7.20. Considering specifically the car-
riers at frequencies f1 and f2, these will give rise to frequencies 2f2 
f1 and 2f1  f2 as a result of the third-order term. (This is demon-
strated in App. E.)
Because f2  f1  "f, these two intermodulation products can be
written as f2  "f and f1  "f, respectively. Thus the intermodulation
products fall on the neighboring carrier frequencies as shown in Fig.
7.20. Similar intermodulation products will arise from other carrier
pairs, and when the carriers are modulated the intermodulation dis-
tortion appears as noise across the transponder frequency band. This
intermodulation noise is considered further in Sec. 12.10.

phase shift, and S is the value at saturation. The AM/PM curve is

TLFeBOOK

In order to reduce the intermodulation distortion, the operating
point of the TWT must be shifted closer to the linear portion of the
curve, the reduction in input power being referred to as input backoff.
When multiple carriers are present, the power output around satura-
tion, for any one carrier, is less than that achieved with single-carrier
operation. This is illustrated by the transfer curves of Fig. 7.21. The
input backoff is the difference in decibels between the carrier input at
the operating point and the saturation input which would be required
for single-carrier operation. The output backoff is the corresponding
drop in output power. Backoff values are always stated in decibels rel-
ative to the saturation point. As a rule of thumb, output backoff is
about 5 dB less than input backoff. The need to incorporate backoff
significantly reduces the channel capacity of a satellite link because of
the reduced carrier-to-noise ratio received at the ground station.
Allowance for backoff in the link budget calculations is dealt with in
Secs. 12.7.2 and 12.8.1.
7.8
The Antenna Subsystem
The antennas carried aboard a satellite provide the dual functions of
receiving the uplink and transmitting the downlink signals. They
range from dipole-type antennas where omnidirectional characteris-
tics are required to the highly directional antennas required for
telecommunications purposes and TV relay and broadcast. Parts of the
antenna structures for the HS 376 and HS 601 satellites can be seen
in Figs. 7.1, 7.2, and 7.7.
Directional beams are usually produced by means of reflector-type
antennas, the paraboloidal reflector being the most common. As shown
in Chap. 6, the gain of the paraboloidal reflector, relative to an isotrop-
ic radiator, is given by Eq. (6.32)

where  is the wavelength of the signal, D is the reflector diameter,
and I is the aperture efficiency. A typical value for I is 0.55. The 3-
dB beamwidth is given approximately by Eq. (6.33) as
3 dB
70 
degrees
The ratio D/ is seen to be the key factor in these equations, the gain
being directly proportional to (D/)2 and the beamwidth inversely pro-
portional to D/. Hence the gain can be increased and the beamwidth
made narrower by increasing the reflector size or decreasing the wave-
length. The largest reflectors are those for the 6/4-GHz band.
Comparable performance can be obtained with considerably smaller
reflectors in the 14/12-GHz band.
Figure 7.22 shows the antenna subsystem of the INTELSAT VI
satellite (Johnston and Thompson, 1982). This provides a good illus-
tration of the level of complexity which has been reached in large com-
munications satellites. The largest reflectors are for the 6/4-GHz
hemisphere and zone coverages, as illustrated in Fig. 7.23. These are
fed from horn arrays, and various groups of horns can be excited to
produce the beam shape required. As can be seen, separate arrays are
used for transmit and receive. Each array has 146 dual-polarization
horns. In the 14/11-GHz band, circular reflectors are used to provide
spot beams, one for east and one for west, also shown in Fig. 7.23.
These beams are fully steerable. Each spot is fed by a single horn
which is used for both transmit and receive.
Wide beams for global coverage are produced by simple horn anten-
nas at 6/4 GHz. These horns beam the signal directly to the earth
without the use of reflectors. Also as shown in Fig. 7.22, a simple
biconical dipole antenna is used for the tracking and control signals.

The complete antenna platform and the communications payload are
despun as described in Sec. 7.3 to keep the antennas pointing to their
correct locations on earth.
The same feed horn may be used to transmit and receive carriers with
the same polarization. The transmit and receive signals are separated in
a device known as a diplexer, and the separation is further aided by means
of frequency filtering. Polarization discrimination also may be used to sep-
arate the transmit and receive signals using the same feed horn. For
example, the horn may be used to transmit horizontally polarized waves
in the downlink frequency band, while simultaneously receiving vertically

takes place in a device known as an orthocoupler, or orthogonal mode
transducer (OMT). Separate horns also may be used for the transmit and
receive functions, with both horns using the same reflector.

Figure 7.24 shows the communications subsystem of the Mexican
satellite Morelos. Two such satellites were launched, Morelos A in
June and Morelos B in November 1985. The satellites are from the
Hughes 376 spacecraft series. Although these satellites had a predict-
ed mission life of 9 years, the second Morelos was scheduled to remain
in operation until 1998. The payload carried on Morelos is referred to
as a hybrid, or dual-band, payload because it carries C-band and K-
band transponders. In the C band it provides 12 narrowband channels,

each 36-MHz wide, and 6 wideband channels, each 72-MHz wide. In
the K band it provides four channels, each 108 MHz wide. The 36-MHz
channels use 7-W TWTAs with 14-for-12 redundancy. This method of
stating redundancy simply means that 12 redundant units are avail-
able for 14 in-service units. The 72-MHz channels use 10.5-W TWTAs
with 8-for-6 redundancy.
The four K-band repeaters use six 20-W TWTAs with 6-for-4 redun-
dancy. The receivers are solid-state designs, and there is a 4-for-2

band receivers.
As mentioned, the satellites are part of the Hughes 376 series, illus-
trated in Figs. 7.1 and 7.6. A 180-cm-diameter circular reflector is used

separate C-band feeds for horizontal and vertical polarizations. The C-
band footprints are shown in Fig. 7.25a.
The K-band reflector is elliptical in shape, with axes measuring 150
by 91 cm. It has its own feed array, producing a footprint which close-
ly matches the contours of the Mexican land mass, as shown in Fig.
7.25b. The K-band reflector is tied to the C-band reflector, and onboard
tracking of a C-band beacon transmitted from the Tulancingo TT&C
station ensures precise pointing of the antennas.
7.10
Anik-E
The Anik-E satellites are part of the Canadian Anik series of satellites
designed to provide communications services in Canada as well as
cross-border services with the United States. The Anik-E is also a
dual-band satellite which has an equivalent capacity of 56 television
channels, or more than 50,000 telephone circuits. Attitude control is of
the momentum-bias, three-axes-stabilized type, and solar sails are
used to provide power, the capacity being 3450 W at summer solstice
and 3700 W at vernal equinox. Four NiH2 batteries are provided for
operation during eclipse. An exploded view of the Anik-E spacecraft
configuration is shown in Fig. 7.26.
The C-band transponder functional block diagram is shown in Fig.
7.27. This is seen to use solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) which
offer significant improvement in reliability and weight saving over
traveling-wave tube amplifiers. The antennas are fed through a broad-
band feeder network (BFN) to illuminate the large reflectors shown in
Fig. 7.26. National, as distinct from regional, coverage is provided at C
band, and some typical predicted satellite transmit footprints are
shown in Fig. 7.28. The frequency and polarization plan for the Anik-
E is similar to that for the Anik-D, which is shown in Fig. 7.29.
The Ku-band transponder functional block diagram is shown in
Fig. 7.30. It will be noted that at these higher frequencies, traveling-
wave tube amplifiers are used. The Anik-E1 frequency and polariza-
tion plan is shown in Fig. 7.31. National and regional beams are
provided for operation within Canada, as well as what is termed
enhanced cross-border capability (ECBC), which provides services to
customers with sites in the United States as well as Canada. The
satellite transmit footprint for the ECBC is shown in Fig. 7.32, and
the receive saturation flux density (SFD) contours are shown in Fig.
7.33. The meaning and significance of the equivalent isotropic radi-
ated power (EIRP) contours and the SFD contours will be explained
in Chap. 12. The Anik-E system characteristics are summarized in
Table 7.1.

The TWTAs aboard a satellite also may be switched to provide
redundancy, as illustrated in Fig. 7.34. The scheme shown is termed a
4-for-2 redundancy, meaning that four channels are provided with two
redundant amplifiers. For example, examination of the table in Fig.
7.34 shows that channel 1A has amplifier 2 as its primary amplifier,
and amplifiers 1 and 3 can be switched in as backup amplifiers by
ground command. In this system, 12 channels are designated as pri-
mary, and the remainder are either used with preemptible traffic or
kept in reserve as backups.

Advanced Tiros-N Spacecraft

ry mission is to gather and transmit earth environmental data down to
its earth stations. Although its payload differs fundamentally from the

communications-relay-type payload, much of the bus equipment is simi-
lar. Table 1.7 lists the NOAA spacecraft used in the Advanced TIROS-N
(ATN) program. The general features of these spacecraft are described in
Schwalb (1982a, 1982b), and current information can be obtained at the
NOAA Web site http://www.noaa.gov/. The main features of the NOAA-
KLM spacecraft are shown in Fig. 7.35, and the physical and orbital
characteristics are given in Table 7.2.
Three nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries supply power while the space-
craft is in darkness. The relatively short lifetime of these spacecraft
results largely from the effects of atmospheric drag present at the low
orbital altitudes. Attitude control of the NOAA spacecraft is achieved
through the use of three reaction wheels similar to the arrangement
shown in Fig. 7.8. A fourth, spare, wheel is carried, angled at 54.7° to
each of the three orthogonal axes. The spare reaction wheel is normally
idle but is activated in the event of failure of any of the other wheels. The
54.7° angle permits its torque to be resolved into components along each
of the three main axes. As can be seen from Fig. 7.35, the antennas are
omnidirectional, but attitude control is needed to maintain directivity for
the earth sensors. These must be maintained within ±0.2° of the local
geographic reference (Schwalb, 1982a).

The Earth Segment
8.1
Introduction
The earth segment of a satellite communications system consists of the
transmit and receive earth stations. The simplest of these are the home
TV receive-only (TVRO) systems, and the most complex are the termi-
nal stations used for international communications networks. Also
included in the earth segment are those stations which are on ships at
sea, and commercial and military land and aeronautical mobile stations.
As mentioned in Chap. 7, earth stations functions used for logistic
support of satellites, such as those providing the telemetry, tracking,
and command (TT&C) functions, are considered as part of the space
segment.
8.2
Receive-Only Home TV Systems
Planned broadcasting directly to home TV receivers takes place in the
Ku (12-GHz) band. This service is known as direct broadcast satellite
(DBS) service. There is some variation in the frequency bands assigned
to different geographic regions. In the Americas, for example, the
downlink band is 12.2 to 12.7 GHz, as described in Sec. 1.4.
The comparatively large satellite receiving dishes (about 3-m diame-
ter) which are a familiar sight around many homes are used to receive
downlink TV signals at C band (4 GHz). Such downlink signals were
never intended for home reception but for network relay to commercial
TV outlets (VHF and UHF TV broadcast stations and cable TV “head-
end” studios). Although the practice of intercepting these signals seems
to be well established at present, various technical and commercial and
legal factors are combining to deter their direct reception. The major
Chapter8

TLFeBOOK

differences between the Ku-band and the C-band receive-only systems
lies in the frequency of operation of the outdoor unit and the fact that
satellites intended for DBS have much higher EIRP, as shown in Table
1.4. For clarity, only the Ku-band system is described here.
Figure 8.1 shows the main units in a home terminal DBS TV receiv-
ing system. Although there will be variations from system to system, the
210

TLFeBOOK

diagram covers the basic concept for analog (FM) TV. Direct-to-home
digital TV, which is well on the way to replacing analog systems, is cov-
ered in Chap. 16. However, the outdoor unit is similar for both systems.
8.2.1
The outdoor unit
This consists of a receiving antenna feeding directly into a low-noise
amplifier/converter combination. A parabolic reflector is generally
used, with the receiving horn mounted at the focus. A common design
is to have the focus directly in front of the reflector, but for better inter-
ference rejection, an offset feed may be used as shown.
Huck and Day (1979) have shown that satisfactory reception can be
achieved with reflector diameters in the range 0.6 to 1.6 m (1.97–5.25
ft), and the two nominal sizes often quoted are 0.9 m (2.95 ft) and 1.2
m (3.94 ft). By contrast, the reflector diameter for 4-GHz reception is
typically about 3 m (9.84 ft). As noted in Sec. 6.13, the gain of a para-
bolic dish is proportional to (D/)2. Comparing the gain of a 3-m dish
at 4 GHz with a 1-m dish at 12 GHz, the ratio D/  40 in each case,
so the gains will be about equal. Although the free-space losses are
much higher at 12 GHz compared with 4 GHz, as described in Chap.
12, a higher-gain receiving antenna is not needed because the direct
broadcast satellites operate at a much higher equivalent isotropic
radiated power (EIRP), as shown in Table 1.4.
The downlink frequency band of 12.2 to 12.7 GHz spans a range of
500 MHz, which accommodates 32 TV/FM channels, each of which is
24 MHz wide. Obviously, some overlap occurs between channels, but
these are alternately polarized left-hand circular (LHC) and right-
hand circular (RHC) or vertical/horizontal, to reduce interference to
acceptable levels. This is referred to as polarization interleaving. A
polarizer that may be switched to the desired polarization from the
indoor control unit is required at the receiving horn.
The receiving horn feeds into a low-noise converter (LNC) or possi-
bly a combination unit consisting of a low-noise amplifier (LNA) fol-
lowed by a converter. The combination is referred to as an LNB, for
low-noise block. The LNB provides gain for the broadband 12-GHz sig-
nal and then converts the signal to a lower frequency range so that a
low-cost coaxial cable can be used as feeder to the indoor unit. The
standard frequency range of this downconverted signal is 950 to 1450
MHz, as shown in Fig. 8.1. The coaxial cable, or an auxiliary wire pair,
is used to carry dc power to the outdoor unit. Polarization-switching
control wires are also required.
The low-noise amplification must be provided at the cable input in
order to maintain a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. A low-noise
amplifier at the indoor end of the cable would be of little use, because
The Earth Segment
211
TLFeBOOK

it would also amplify the cable thermal noise. Single-to-noise ratio is
considered in more detail in Sec. 12.5. Of course, having to mount the
LNB outside means that it must be able to operate over a wide range
of climatic conditions, and homeowners may have to contend with the
added problems of vandalism and theft.
8.2.2
The indoor unit for analog (FM) TV
The signal fed to the indoor unit is normally a wideband signal cover-
ing the range 950 to 1450 MHz. This is amplified and passed to a track-
ing filter which selects the desired channel, as shown in Fig. 8.1. As
previously mentioned, polarization interleaving is used, and only half
the 32 channels will be present at the input of the indoor unit for any
one setting of the antenna polarizer. This eases the job of the tracking
filter, since alternate channels are well separated in frequency.
The selected channel is again downconverted, this time from the
950- to 1450-MHz range to a fixed intermediate frequency, usually 70
MHz although other values in the VHF range are also used. The 70-
MHz amplifier amplifies the signal up to the levels required for
demodulation. A major difference between DBS TV and conventional
TV is that with DBS, frequency modulation is used, whereas with con-
ventional TV, amplitude modulation in the form of vestigial single
sideband (VSSB) is used. The 70-MHz, frequency-modulated IF carri-
er therefore must be demodulated, and the baseband information used
to generate a VSSB signal which is fed into one of the VHF/UHF chan-
nels of a standard TV set.
A DBS receiver provides a number of functions not shown on the
simplified block diagram of Fig. 8.1. The demodulated video and audio
signals are usually made available at output jacks. Also, as described
in Sec. 13.3, an energy-dispersal waveform is applied to the satellite
carrier to reduce interference, and this waveform has to be removed in
the DBS receiver. Terminals also may be provided for the insertion of
IF filters to reduce interference from terrestrial TV networks, and a
descrambler also may be necessary for the reception of some programs.
The indoor unit for digital TV is described in Chap. 16.
8.3
Master Antenna TV System
A master antenna TV (MATV) system is used to provide reception of
DBS TV/FM channels to a small group of users, for example, to the ten-
ants in an apartment building. It consists of a single outdoor unit
(antenna and LNA/C) feeding a number of indoor units, as shown in Fig.
8.2. It is basically similar to the home system already described, but
with each user having access to all the channels independently of the
other users. The advantage is that only one outdoor unit is required, but
212
Chapter Eight
TLFeBOOK

as shown, separate LNA/Cs and feeder cables are required for each
sense of polarization. Compared with the single-user system, a larger
antenna is also required (2- to 3-m diameter) in order to maintain a good
signal-to-noise ratio at all the indoor units.
Where more than a few subscribers are involved, the distribution sys-
tem used is similar to the CATV system described in the next section.
8.4
Community Antenna TV System
The community antenna TV system employs a single outdoor unit, with
separate feeds available for each sense of polarization, like the MATV
system, so that all channels are made available simultaneously at the
indoor receiver. Instead of having a separate receiver for each user, all
the carriers are demodulated in a common receiver-filter system, as
The Earth Segment
213
Figure 8.2
One possible arrangement for a master antenna TV (MATV) system.
TLFeBOOK

shown in Fig. 8.3. The channels are then combined into a standard mul-
tiplexed signal for transmission over cable to the subscribers.
In remote areas where a cable distribution system may not be
installed, the signal can be rebroadcast from a low-power VHF TV
transmitter. Figure 8.4 shows a remote TV station which employs an
8-m (26.2-ft), antenna for reception of the satellite TV signal in the C
band.
With the CATV system, local programming material also may be dis-
tributed to subscribers, an option which is not permitted in the MATV
system.
8.5
Transmit-Receive Earth Stations
In the previous sections, receive-only TV stations are described.
Obviously, somewhere a transmit station must complete the uplink to
the satellite. In some situations, a transmit-only station is required,
for example, in relaying TV signals to the remote TV receive-only sta-
tions already described. Transmit-receive stations provide both func-
tions and are required for telecommunications traffic generally,
including network TV. The uplink facilities for digital TV are highly
specialized and are covered in Chap. 16.
The basic elements for a redundant earth station are shown in Fig.
8.5. As mentioned in connection with transponders in Sec. 7.7.1,
214

TLFeBOOK

redundancy means that certain units are duplicated. A duplicate, or
redundant, unit is automatically switched into a circuit to replace a
corresponding unit that has failed. Redundant units are shown by
dashed lines in Fig. 8.5.
The block diagram is shown in more detail in Fig. 8.6, where, for
clarity, redundant units are not shown. Starting at the bottom of the
diagram, the first block shows the interconnection equipment required
between satellite station and the terrestrial network. For the purpose
of explanation, telephone traffic will be assumed. This may consist of
a number of telephone channels in a multiplexed format. Multiplexing
is a method of grouping telephone channels together, usually in basic
groups of 12, without mutual interference. It is described in detail in
Chaps. 9 and 10.
It may be that groupings different from those used in the terrestri-
al network are required for satellite transmission, and the next block
shows the multiplexing equipment in which the reformatting is car-
ried out. Following along the transmit chain, the multiplexed signal
is modulated onto a carrier wave at an intermediate frequency, usu-
ally 70 MHz. Parallel IF stages are required, one for each microwave
carrier to be transmitted. After amplification at the 70-MHz IF, the
modulated signal is then upconverted to the required microwave car-
rier frequency. A number of carriers may be transmitted simultane-
ously, and although these are at different frequencies they are
generally specified by their nominal frequency, for example, as 6-GHz
or 14-GHz carriers.
It should be noted that the individual carriers may be multidestina-
tion carriers. This means that they carry traffic destined for different
stations. For example, as part of its load, a microwave carrier may
have telephone traffic for Boston and New York. The same carrier is
received at both places, and the designated traffic sorted out by filters
at the receiving earth station.
Referring again to the block diagram of Fig. 8.6, after passing
through the upconverters, the carriers are combined, and the resulting
wideband signal is amplified. The wideband power signal is fed to the
antenna through a diplexer, which allows the antenna to handle trans-
mit and receive signals simultaneously.
The station’s antenna functions in both the transmit and receive
modes, but at different frequencies. In the C band, the nominal uplink,
or transmit, frequency is 6 GHz and the downlink, or receive, frequency
is nominally 4 GHz. In the Ku band, the uplink frequency is nominally
14 GHz, and the downlink, 12 GHz. High-gain antennas are employed
in both bands, which also means narrow antenna beams. A narrow
beam is necessary to prevent interference between neighboring satellite
links. In the case of C band, interference to and from terrestrial
The Earth Segment
215
TLFeBOOK

microwave links also must be avoided. Terrestrial microwave links do
not operate at Ku-band frequencies.
In the receive branch (the right side of Fig. 8.6), the incoming wide-
band signal is amplified in a low-noise amplifier and passed to a
divider network, which separates out the individual microwave carri-
ers. These are each downconverted to an IF band and passed on to the
multiplex block, where the multiplexed signals are reformatted as
required by the terrestrial network.
It should be noted that, in general, the signal traffic flow on the
receive side will differ from that on the transmit side. The incoming
microwave carriers will be different in number and in the amount of
traffic carried, and the multiplexed output will carry telephone circuits
not necessarily carried on the transmit side.
A number of different classes of earth stations are available, depend-
ing on the service requirements. Traffic can be broadly classified as
heavy route, medium route, and thin route. In a thin-route circuit, a
transponder channel (36 MHz) may be occupied by a number of single
carriers, each associated with its own voice circuit. This mode of opera-
tion is known as single carrier per channel (SCPC), a multiple-access
mode which is discussed further in Chap. 14. Antenna sizes range from
3.6 m (11.8 ft) for transportable stations up to 30 m (98.4 ft) for a main
terminal.
A medium-route circuit also provides multiple access, either on the
basis of frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) or time-division
multiple access (TDMA), multiplexed baseband signals being carried
in either case. These access modes are also described in detail in Chap.
14. Antenna sizes range from 30 m (89.4 ft) for a main station to 10 m
(32.8 ft) for a remote station.

In a 6/4-GHz heavy-route system, each satellite channel (bandwidth
36 MHz) is capable of carrying over 960 one-way voice circuits simulta-
neously or a single-color analog TV signal with associated audio (in
some systems two analog TV signals can be accommodated). Thus the
transponder channel for a heavy-route circuit carries one large-band-
width signal which may be TV or multiplexed telephony. The antenna
diameter for a heavy-route circuit is at least 30 m (98.4 ft). For interna-
tional operation such antennas are designed to the INTELSAT specifi-
cations for a Standard A earth station (Intelsat, 1982). Figure 8.7 shows
a photograph of a 32-m (105-ft) Standard A earth station antenna.

It will be appreciated that for these large antennas, which may weigh
in the order of 250 tons, the foundations must be very strong and sta-
ble. Such large diameters automatically mean very narrow beams, and
therefore, any movement which would deflect the beam unduly must be
avoided. Where snow and ice conditions are likely to be encountered,
built-in heaters are required. For the antenna shown in Fig. 8.7, deic-
ing heaters provide reflector surface heat of 40W/ft2 for the main reflec-
tors and subreflectors, and 3000 W for the azimuth wheels.
Although these antennas are used with geostationary satellites,
some drift in the satellite position does occur, as shown in Chap. 3.
This, combined with the very narrow beams of the larger earth station
antennas, means that some provision must be made for a limited
degree of tracking. Step adjustments in azimuth and elevation may be
made under computer control, to maximize the received signal.
The continuity of the primary power supply is another important
consideration in the design of transmit-receive earth stations. Apart
from the smallest stations, power backup in the form of multiple feeds
from the commercial power source and/or batteries and generators is
provided. If the commercial power fails, batteries immediately take
over with no interruption. At the same time, the standby generators

Analog Signals
9.1
Introduction
Analog signals are electrical replicas of the original signals such as
audio and video. Baseband signals are those signals which occupy the
lowest, or base, band of frequencies, in the frequency spectrum used by
the telecommunications network. A baseband signal may consist of one
or more information signals. For example, a number of analog tele-
phony signals may be combined into one baseband signal by the
process known as frequency-division multiplexing. Other common
types of baseband signals are the multiplexed video and audio signals
which originate in the TV studio. In forming the multiplexed baseband
signals, the information signals are modulated onto subcarriers. This
modulation step must be distinguished from the modulation process
which places the multiplexed signal onto the microwave carrier for
transmission to the satellite.
In this chapter, the characteristics of the more common types of ana-
log baseband signals are described, along with representative methods
of analog modulation.
9.2
The Telephone Channel
Natural speech, including that of female and male voices, covers a fre-
quency range of about 80 to 8000 Hz. The somewhat unnatural quali-
ty associated with telephone speech results from the fact that a
considerably smaller band of frequencies is used for normal telephone
transmission. The range of 300 to 3400 Hz is accepted internationally
as the standard for “telephone quality” speech, and this is termed the
Chapter9

TLFeBOOK

speech baseband. In practice, some variations occur in the basebands
used by different telephone companies. The telephone channel is often
referred to as a voice frequency (VF) channel, and in this book this will
be taken to mean the frequency range of 300 to 3400 Hz.
There are good reasons for limiting the frequency range. Noise,
which covers a very wide frequency spectrum, is reduced by reducing
the bandwidth. Also, reducing the bandwidth allows more telephone
channels to be carried over a given type of circuit, as will be described
in Sec. 9.4.
The signal levels encountered within telephone networks vary con-
siderably. Audio signal levels are often measured in volume units (VU).
For a sinusoidal signal within the voice frequency range, 0 VU corre-
sponds to 1 mW of power, or 0 dBm. No simple relationship exists
between volume units and power for speech signals, but as a rough
guide, the power level in dBm of normal speech is given by 1.4 VU.
As a rule of thumb, the average voice level on a telephone circuit (or
mean talker level) is defined as 13 VU (see Freeman, 1981).
9.3
Single-Sideband Telephony
Figure 9.1a shows how the VF baseband may be represented in the
frequency domain. In some cases, the triangular representation has
the small end of the triangle at 0 Hz, even though frequency compo-
nents below 300 Hz actually may not be present. Also, in some cases,
the upper end is set at 4 kHz to indicate allowance for a guard band,
the need for which will be described later.
When the telephone signal is multiplied in the time domain with a
sinusoidal carrier of frequency fc, a new spectrum results, in which the
original baseband appears on either side of the carrier frequency. This
is illustrated in Fig. 9.1b for a carrier of 20 kHz, where the band of fre-
quencies below the carrier is referred to as the lower sideband and the
band above the carrier as the upper sideband. To avoid distortion
which would occur with sideband overlap, the carrier frequency must
be greater than the highest frequency in the baseband.
The result of this multiplication process is referred to as double-side-
band suppressed-carrier (DSBSC) modulation, since only the side-
bands, and not the carrier, appear in the spectrum. Now, all the
information in the original telephone signal is contained in either of
the two sidebands, and therefore, it is necessary to transmit only one
of these. A filter may be used to select either one and reject the other.
The resulting output is termed a single-sideband (SSB) signal.
The SSB process utilizing the lower sideband is illustrated in Fig.
9.2, where a 20-kHz carrier is used as an example. It will be seen that
for the lower sideband, the frequencies have been inverted, the 
222
Chapter Nine
TLFeBOOK

highest baseband frequency being translated to the lowest transmis-
sion frequency at 16.6 kHz and the lowest baseband frequency to the
highest transmission frequency at 19.7 kHz. This inversion does not
affect the final baseband output, since the demodulation process rein-
verts the spectrum. At the receiver, the SSB signal is demodulated
(i.e., the baseband signal is recovered) by being passed through an
identical multiplying process. In this case the multiplying sinusoid,
termed the local oscillator signal, must have the same frequency as
the original carrier. A low-pass filter is required at the output to select
the baseband signal and reject other, unwanted frequency components
generated in the demodulation process. This single-sideband modula-
tion/demodulation process is illustrated in Fig. 9.2.
The way in which SSB signals are used for the simultaneous trans-
mission of a number of telephone signals is described in the next sec-
tion. It should be noted at this point that a number of different carriers
are likely to be used in a satellite link. The radiofrequency (rf) carrier
used in transmission to and from the satellite will be much higher in
Analog Signals

frequency than those used for the generation of the set of SSB signals.
These latter carriers are sometimes referred to as a voice-frequency
carriers. The term subcarrier is also used, and this practice will be fol-
lowed here. Thus the 20-kHz carrier shown in Fig. 9.2 is a subcarrier.
Companded single sideband (CSSB) refers to a technique in which
the speech signal levels are compressed before transmission as a sin-
gle sideband, and at the receiver they are expanded again back to their
original levels. (The term compander is derived from compressor-
expander). In one companded system described by Campanella (1983),
a 2:1 compression in decibels is used, followed by a 1:2 expansion at
the receiver. It is shown in the reference that the expander decreases
its attenuation when a speech signal is present and increases its atten-
uation when it is absent. In this way the “idle” noise on the channel is
reduced, which allows the channel to operate at a reduced carrier-to-
noise ratio. This in turn permits more channels to occupy a given satel-
lite link, a topic which comes under the heading of multiple access and
which is described more fully in Chap. 14.
9.4
FDM Telephony
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) provides a way of keeping a
number of individual telephone signals separate while transmitting
them simultaneously over a common transmission link circuit. Each
telephone baseband signal is modulated onto a separate subcarrier,
and all the upper or all the lower sidebands are combined to form the
frequency-multiplexed signal. Figure 9.3a shows how three voice chan-
nels may be frequency-division multiplexed. Each voice channel occu-
pies the range 300 to 3400 Hz, and each is modulated onto its own
subcarrier. The subcarrier frequency separation is 4 kHz, this allowing
for the basic voice bandwidth of 3.1 kHz plus an adequate guard band
for filtering. The upper sidebands are selected by means of filters and
then combined to form the final three-channel multiplexed signal. The
three-channel FDM pregroup signal can be represented by a single tri-
angle, as shown in Fig. 9.3b.
To facilitate interconnection among the different telecommunica-
tions systems in use worldwide, the Comité Consultatif Internationale
de Télégraphique et Téléphonique (CCITT)1 has recommended a stan-
dard modulation plan for FDM (CCITT G322 and G423, 1976). The
standard group in the plan consists of 12 voice channels. One way to
create such groups is to use an arrangement similar to that shown in

are required. In the standard plan, the lower sidebands are selected by
the filters, and the group bandwidth extends from 60 to 108 kHz.
As an alternative to forming a 12-channel group directly, the VF
channels may be frequency-division multiplexed in threes by using the
arrangement shown in Fig. 9.3a. The four 3-channel-multiplexed sig-
nals, termed pregroups, are then combined to form the 12-channel
group. This approach eases the filtering requirements but does require
an additional mixer stage, which adds noise to the process.
The main group designations in the CCITT modulation plan are
Group. As already described, this consists of 12 voice-frequency
channels, each occupying a 4-kHz bandwidth in the multiplexed out-
put. The overall bandwidth of a group extends from 60 to 108 kHz.
Supergroup. A supergroup is formed by frequency-division multi-
plexing five groups together. The lower sidebands are combined to
form a 60-VF-channel supergroup extending from 312 to 552 kHz.

Basic mastergroup. A basic mastergroup is formed by frequency-
division multiplexing five supergroups together. The lower side-
bands are combined to form a 300-VF-channel basic mastergroup.
Allowing for 8-kHz guard bands between sidebands, the basic mas-
tergroup extends from 812 to 2044 kHz.
Super mastergroup. A super mastergroup is formed by frequency-
division multiplexing three basic mastergroups together. The lower
sidebands are combined to form the 900-VF-channel super master-
group. Allowing for 88-kHz guard bands between sidebands, the
super mastergroup extends from 8516 to 12,388 kHz.
In satellite communications, such multiplexed signals often form the
baseband signal which is used to frequency modulate a microwave car-
rier (see Sec. 9.6). The smallest baseband unit is usually the 12-chan-
nel voice-frequency group, and larger groupings are multiples of this
unit. Figure 9.4 shows how 24-, 60-, and 252-VF-channel baseband sig-
nals may be formed. These examples are taken from CCITT
Recommendations G322 and G423. It will be observed that in each
case a group occupies the range 12 to 60 kHz. Because of this, the 60-
VF-channel baseband which modulates the carrier to the satellite dif-
fers somewhat from the standard 60-VF-channel supergroup signal
used for terrestrial cable or microwave FDM links.

Color Television
The baseband signal for television is a composite of the visual infor-
mation signals and synchronization signals. The visual information is
transmitted as three signal components, denoted as the Y, I, and Q sig-
nals. The Y signal is a luminance, or intensity, component and is also
the only visual information signal required by monochrome receivers.
The I and Q signals are termed chrominance components, and togeth-
er they convey information on the hue or tint and on the amount of sat-
uration of the coloring which is present.
The synchronization signal consists of narrow pulses at the end of
each line scan for horizontal synchronization and a sequence of nar-
rower and wider pulses at the end of each field scan for vertical syn-
chronization. Additional synchronization for the color information
demodulation in the receiver is superimposed on the horizontal 
pulses, as described below.
The luminance signal and the synchronization pulses require a base
bandwidth of 4.2 MHz for North American standards. The baseband
extends down to and includes a dc component. The composite signal
containing the luminance and synchronization information is designed
to be fully compatible with the requirements of monochrome (black-
and-white) receivers.

TLFeBOOK

In transmitting the chrominance information, use is made of the fact
that the eye cannot resolve colors to the extent that it can intensity
detail; this allows the chrominance signal bandwidth to be less than
that of the luminance signal. The I and Q chrominance signals are
transmitted within the luminance bandwidth by quadrature DSBSC
(see below), modulating them onto a subcarrier which places them at
the upper end of the luminance signal spectrum. Use is made of the
fact that the eye cannot readily perceive the interference which results
when the chrominance signals are transmitted within the luminance-
signal bandwidth. The baseband response is shown in Fig. 9.5.
Different methods of chrominance subcarrier modulation are
employed in different countries. In France, a system known as sequen-
tial couleur a mémoire (SECAM) is used. In most other European
countries, a system known as phase alternation line (PAL) is used. In
North America, the NTSC system is used, where NTSC stands for
National Television System Committee.
In the NTSC system, each chrominance signal is modulated onto its
subcarrier using DSBSC modulation, as described in Sec. 9.3. A single
oscillator source is used so that the I and Q signal subcarriers have the
same frequency, but one of the subcarriers is shifted 90° in phase to
preserve the separate chrominance information in the I and Q base-
band signals. This method is known as quadrature modulation (QM).
The I signal is the chrominance signal which modulates the in-phase
carrier. Its bandwidth in the NTSC system is restricted to 1.5 MHz,
and after modulation onto the subcarrier, a single-sideband filter
removes the upper sideband components more than 0.5 MHz above the
carrier. This is referred to as a vestigial sideband (VSB). The modu-
lated I signal therefore consists of the 1.5-MHz lower sideband plus
the 0.5 MHz upper VSB.
The Q signal is the chrominance signal which modulates the quad-
rature carrier. Its bandwidth is restricted to 0.5 MHz, and after mod-
ulation, a DSBSC signal results. The spectrum magnitude of the
combined I and Q signals is shown in Fig. 9.5.

Chapter Nine
Figure 9.5

nance signals.
TLFeBOOK

The magnitude of the QM envelope contains the color saturation
information, and the phase angle of the QM envelope contains the hue,
or tint, information. The chrominance signal subcarrier frequency has
to be precisely controlled, and in the NTSC system it is held at
3.579545 MHz ± 10 Hz, which places the subcarrier frequency midway
between the 227th and the 228th harmonics of the horizontal scanning
rate (frequency). The luminance and chrominance signals are both
characterized by spectra wherein the power spectral density occurs in
groups which are centered about the harmonics of the horizontal scan
frequency. Placing the chrominance subcarrier midway between the
227th and 228th horizontal-scan harmonics of the luminance-plus-
synchronization signals causes the luminance and the chrominance
signals to be interleaved in the spectrum of the composite NTSC sig-
nal. This interleaving is most apparent in the range from about 3.0 to
4.1 MHz. The presence of the chrominance signal causes high-fre-
quency modulation of the luminance signal and produces a very fine
stationary dot-matrix pattern in the picture areas of high color satu-
ration. To prevent this, most of the cheaper TV receivers limit the
luminance channel video bandwidth to about 2.8 to 3.1 MHz. More
expensive “high resolution” receivers employ a comb filter to remove
most of the chrominance signal from the luminance-channel signal
while still maintaining about a 4-MHz luminance-channel video band-
width.
Because the subcarrier is suppressed in the modulation process, a
subcarrier frequency and phase reference carrier must be transmitted
to allow the I and Q baseband chrominance signals to be demodulated
at the receiver. This reference signal is transmitted in the form of
bursts of eight to eleven cycles of the phase-shifted subcarrier, trans-
mitted on the “backporch” of the horizontal blanking pulse. These
bursts are transmitted toward the end of each line sync period, part of
the line sync pulse being suppressed to accommodate them. One line
waveform including the synchronization signals is shown in Fig. 9.6.
Figure 9.7 shows in block schematic form the NTSC system. The TV
camera contains three separate camera tubes, one for each of the col-
ors red, blue, and green. It is known that colored light can be synthe-
sized by additive mixing of red, blue, and green light beams, these
being the three primary light beam colors. For example, yellow is
obtained by adding red and green light. (This process must be distin-
guished from the subtractive process of paint pigments, in which the
primary pigment colors are red, blue, and yellow.)
Color filters are used in front of each tube to sharpen its response.
In principle, it would be possible to transmit the three color signals
and at the receiver reconstruct the color scene from them. However,
this is not the best technical approach because such signals would not
Analog Signals
229
TLFeBOOK

be compatible with monochrome television and would require extra
bandwidth. Instead, three new signals are generated which do provide
compatibility and do not require extra bandwidth. These are the lumi-
nance signal and the two chrominance signals which have been
described already. The process of generating the new signals from the
color signals is mathematically equivalent to having three equations
in three variables and rearranging these in terms of three new vari-
ables which are linear combinations of the original three. The details
are shown in the matrix M block of Fig. 9.7, and derivation of the equa-
tions from this is left as Prob. 9.9.
At the receiver, the three color signals can be synthesized from the
luminance and chrominance components. Again, this is mathematical-
ly equivalent to rearranging the three equations into their original
form. The three color signals then modulate the electron beams which
excite the corresponding color phosphors in the TV tube. The complete
video signal is therefore a multiplexed baseband signal which extends
from dc up to 4.2 MHz and which contains all the visual information
plus synchronization signals.
In conventional TV broadcasting, the aural signal is transmitted by
a separate transmitter, as shown in Fig. 9.8a. The aural information is
received by stereo microphones, split into (L  R) and (L  R) signals,
where L stands for left and R for right. The (L  R) signal is used to
DSBSC modulate a subcarrier at 2fh (31.468 kHz). This DSBSC signal
is then added to the (L  R) signal and used to frequency modulate a
separate transmitter whose rf carrier frequency is 4.5 MHz above the
rf carrier frequency of the video transmitter. The outputs of these two
transmitters may go to separate antennas or may be combined and fed
into a single antenna, as is shown in Fig. 9.8a.
The signal format for satellite analog TV differs from that of con-
ventional TV, as shown in Fig. 9.8. To generate the uplink microwave

TV signal to a communications satellite transponder channel, the com-
posite video signal (going from 0 Hz to about 4.2 MHz for the North
American NTSC standard) is added to two or three FM carriers at fre-
quencies of 6.2, 6.8, and/or 7.4 MHz, which carry audio information.
This composite FDM signal is then, in turn, used to frequency modu-
late the uplink microwave carrier signal, producing a signal with an rf
bandwidth of about 36 MHz. The availability of three possible audio

signal carriers permits the transmission of stereo and/or multilingual
audio over the satellite link. Figure 9.8b shows a block diagram of this
system.
As mentioned previously, three color TV systems, NTSC, PAL, and
SECAM, are in widespread use. In addition, different countries use dif-
ferent line frequencies (determined by the frequency of the domestic
power supply) and different numbers of lines per scan. Broadcasting
between countries utilizing different standards requires the use of a
converter. Transmission takes place using the standards of the country
originating the broadcast, and conversion to the standards of the receiv-
ing country takes place at the receiving station. The conversion may

take place through optical image processing or by conversion of the elec-
tronic signal format. The latter can be further subdivided into analog
and digital techniques. The digital converter, referred to as digital inter-
continental conversion equipment (DICE), is favored because of its good
performance and lower cost (see Miya, 1981).
9.6
Frequency Modulation
The analog signals discussed in the previous sections are transferred
to the microwave carrier by means of frequency modulation (FM).
Instead of being done in one step, as shown in Fig. 9.8b, this modula-
tion usually takes place at an intermediate frequency, as shown in Fig.
8.6. This signal is then frequency multiplied up to the required uplink
microwave frequency. In the receive branch of Fig. 8.6, the incoming
(downlink) FM microwave signal is downconverted to an intermediate
frequency, and the “baseband” signal is recovered from the IF carrier
in the demodulator. The actual baseband video signal is now available
directly via a low-pass filter, but the audio channels must each under-
go an additional step of FM demodulation to recover the baseband
audio signals.
A major advantage associated with frequency modulation is the
improvement in the postdetection signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver
output compared with other analog modulation methods. This
improvement can be attributed to three factors: (1) amplitude limiting,
(2) a property of FM which allows an exchange between signal-to-noise
ratio and bandwidth, and (3) a noise reduction inherent in the way
noise phase modulates a carrier. These factors are discussed in more
detail in the following sections.
Figure 9.9 shows the basic circuit blocks of an FM receiver. The
receiver noise, including that from the antenna, can be lumped into
one equivalent noise source at the receiver input, as described in Sec.
12.5. It is emphasized at this point that thermal-like noise only is
being considered, the main characteristic of which is that the spectral
density of the noise power is constant, as given by Eq. (12.15). This is
referred to as a flat spectrum. (This type of noise is also referred to as
white noise in analogy to white light, which contains a uniform spec-
trum of colors.) Both the signal spectrum and the noise spectrum are

converted to the intermediate frequency bands, with the bandwidth of
the IF stage determining the total noise power at the input to the
demodulator. The IF bandwidth has to be wide enough to accommo-
date the FM signal, as described in Sec. 9.6.2, but should be no wider.
9.6.1
Limiters
The total thermal noise referred to the receiver input modulates the
incoming carrier in amplitude and in phase. The rf limiter circuit
(often referred to as an instantaneous or “hard” limiter) following the
IF amplifier removes the amplitude modulation, leaving only the
phase-modulation component of the noise. The limiter is an amplifier
designed to operate as a class A amplifier for small signals. With large
signals, positive excursions are limited by the saturation characteris-
tics of the transistor (which is operated at a low collector voltage), and
negative excursions generate a self-bias which drives the transistor
into cutoff. Although the signal is severely distorted by this action, a
tuned circuit in the output selects the FM carrier and its sidebands
from the distorted signal spectrum, and thus the constant amplitude
characteristic of the FM signal is restored. This is the amplitude-lim-
iting improvement referred to previously. Only the noise phase modu-
lation contributes to the noise at the output of the demodulator.
Amplitude limiting is also effective in reducing the interference pro-
duced by impulse-type noise, such as that generated by certain types
of electrical machinery. Noise of this nature may be picked up by the
antenna and superimposed as large amplitude excursions on the car-
rier, which the limiter removes. Limiting also can greatly alleviate the
interference caused by other, weaker signals which occur within the IF
bandwidth. When the limiter is either saturated or cut off by the larg-
er signal, the weaker signal has no effect. This is known as limiter cap-
ture (see, for example, Young, 1990).
9.6.2
Bandwidth
When considering bandwidth, it should be kept in mind that the word
is used in a number of contexts. Signal bandwidth is a measure of the
frequency spectrum occupied by the signal. Filter bandwidth is the fre-
quency range passed by circuit filters. Channel bandwidth refers to
the overall bandwidth of the transmission channel, which in general
will include a number of filters at different stages. In a well-designed
system, the channel bandwidth will match the signal bandwidth.
Bandwidth requirements will be different at different points in the
system. For example, at the receiver inputs for C-band and Ku-band
satellite systems, the bandwidth typically is 500 MHz, this accommo-

dating 12 transponders as described in Sec. 7.7. The individual
transponder bandwidth is typically 36 MHz. In contrast, the baseband
bandwidth for a telephony channel is typically 3.1 kHz.
In theory, the spectrum of a frequency-modulated carrier extends to
infinity. In a practical satellite system, the bandwidth of the transmit-
ted FM signal is limited by the intermediate-frequency amplifiers. The
IF bandwidth, denoted by BIF, must be wide enough to pass all the sig-
nificant components in the FM signal spectrum that is generated. The
required bandwidth is usually estimated by Carson’s rule as
BIF  2 (F  FM)
(9.1)
where F is the peak carrier deviation produced by the modulating
baseband signal, and FM is the highest frequency component in the
baseband signal. These maximum values, F and FM, are specified in
the regulations governing the type of service. For example, for com-
mercial FM sound broadcasting in North America, F  75 kHz and
FM  15 kHz.
The deviation ratio D is defined as the ratio
D 

BIF  2 (10.752  4.2)  29.9 MHz
A similar ratio, known as the modulation index, is defined for sinu-
soidal modulation. This is usually denoted by ß in the literature.
Letting f represent the peak deviation for sinusoidal modulation and
fm the sinusoidal modulating frequency gives
ß 
(9.3)
The difference between ß and D is that D applies for an arbitrary
modulating signal and is the ratio of the maximum permitted values
of deviation and baseband frequency, whereas ß applies only for sinu-
soidal modulation (or what is often termed tone modulation). Very
often the analysis of an FM system will be carried out for tone

matics are easier and the results usually give a good indication of what
to expect with an arbitrary signal.

Carson’s rule is widely used in practice, even though it tends to give
an underestimate of the bandwidth required for deviation ratios in the
range 2  D  10, which is the range most often encountered in prac-
tice. For this range, a better estimate of bandwidth is given by

For the 800 Hz tone: BIF  2 (200  1.6)  403.2 kHz
In Examples 9.1 through 9.3 it will be seen that when the deviation
ratio (or modulation index) is large, the bandwidth is determined
mainly by the peak deviation and is given by either Eq. (9.1) or Eq.
(9.4). However, for the video signal, for which the deviation ratio is rel-
atively low, the two estimates of bandwidth are 29.9 and 38.3 MHz. In
practice, the standard bandwidth of a satellite transponder required to
handle this signal is 36 MHz.
The peak frequency deviation of an FM signal is proportional to the
peak amplitude of the baseband signal. Increasing the peak amplitude
results in increased signal power and hence a larger signal-to-noise
ratio. At the same time, "F, and hence the FM signal bandwidth, will
increase as shown previously. Although the noise power at the demod-
ulator input is proportional to the IF filter bandwidth, the noise pow-
er output after the demodulator is determined by the bandwidth of the
baseband filters, and therefore, an increase in IF filter band-width
does not increase output noise. Thus an improvement in signal-
to-noise ratio is possible but at the expense of an increase in the IF

bandwidth. This is the large-amplitude signal improvement referred
to in Sec. 9.6 and considered further in the next section.
9.6.3
FM detector noise and processing
gain
At the input to the FM detector, the thermal noise is spread over the
IF bandwidth, as shown in Fig. 9.10a. The noise is represented by the
system noise temperature Ts, as will be described in Sec. 12.5. At the
input to the detector, the quantity of interest is the carrier-to-noise
ratio. Since both the carrier and the noise are amplified equally by the
receiver gain following the antenna input, this gain may be ignored in
the carrier-to-noise ratio calculation, and the input to the detector rep-
resented by the voltage source shown in Fig. 9.10b. The carrier root-
mean-square (rms) voltage is shown as Ec.
The available carrier power at the input to the FM detector is Ec/4R,
and the available noise power at the FM detector input is kTsBN (as

C/N, is

(9.5)
The receiver noise voltage phase modulates the incoming carrier. (It
cannot directly frequency modulate the carrier, whose frequency is deter-
mined at the transmitter, which is at a great distance from the receiver
and which may be crystal controlled.) A characteristic of phase modula-
tion is that for the condition that the noise voltage is much less than the
carrier voltage, the voltage spectral density of the noise at the detector
output increases in direct proportion to the noise frequency, where the
noise frequency is fn, as shown in Fig. 9.10a. The noise voltage spectral
density (measured in volts per hertz) is as shown in Fig. 9.11.
The noise occurs on both sides of the carrier, but because the post-
detector filters limit the frequency to some upper value W, in calcula-
tions of the output noise it is necessary only to consider the spectrum
between the limits fc  W and fc  W, as shown in Fig. 9.10a. The aver-

Here, ß  f/W is the modulation index for a sinusoidal modulation

the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased even though the carrier-to-
noise ratio is constant.
9.6.4
Signal-to-noise ratio
The term signal-to-noise ratio introduced in the preceding section is
used to refer to the ratio of signal power to noise power at the receiv-
er output. This ratio is sometimes referred to as the postdetector or
destination signal-to-noise ratio. In general, it differs from the carrier-
to-noise ratio at the detector input (the words detector and demodula-
tor may be used interchangeably), the two ratios being related through
the receiver processing gain as shown by Eq. (9.9). Equation (9.9) may
be written in decibel form as

This shows that the signal-to-noise in decibels is proportional to the
carrier-to-noise in decibels. However, these equations were developed
for the condition that the noise voltage should be much less than the
carrier voltage. At low carrier-to-noise ratios this assumption no
longer holds, and the detector exhibits a threshold effect. This is a
threshold level in the carrier-to-noise ratio below which the signal-to-
noise ratio degrades very rapidly. The threshold level is shown in Fig.
9.12 and is defined as the carrier-to-noise ratio at which the signal-to-
noise ratio is 1 dB below the straight-line plot of Eq. (9.12). For con-
ventional FM detectors (such as the Foster Seeley detector), the
threshold level may be taken as 10 dB. Threshold extension detector
circuits are available which can provide a reduction in the threshold
level of between 3 and 7 dB (Fthenakis, 1984).

In normal operation, the operating point will always be above

Preemphasis and deemphasis
As shown in Fig. 9.11, the noise voltage spectral density increases in
direct proportion to the demodulated noise frequency. As a result, the
signal-to-noise ratio is worse at the high-frequency end of the base-
band, a fact which is not apparent from the equation for signal-to-
noise ratio, which uses average values of signal and noise power. For
example, if a test tone is used to measure the signal-to-noise ratio in a
TV baseband channel, the result will depend on the position of the test
tone within the baseband, a better result being obtained at lower test
tone frequencies. For FDM/FM telephony, the telephone channels at
the low end of the FDM baseband would have better signal-to-noise
ratios than those at the high end.
To equalize the performance over the baseband, a deemphasis net-
work is introduced after the demodulator to attenuate the high-fre-
quency components of noise. Over most of the baseband, the
attenuation-frequency curve of the deemphasis network is the inverse
of the rising noise-frequency characteristic shown in Fig. 9.11 (for
practical reasons it is not feasible to have exact compensation over the
complete frequency range). Thus, after deemphasis, the noise-frequen-
cy characteristic is flat, as shown in Fig. 9.13d. Of course, the deem-
phasis network also will attenuate the signal, and to correct for this, a
complementary preemphasis characteristic is introduced prior to the
modulator at the transmitter. The overall effect is to leave the postde-
tection signal levels unchanged while the high-frequency noise is
attenuated. The preemphasis, deemphasis sequence is illustrated in
Fig. 9.13.

The resulting improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is referred to
variously as preemphasis improvement, deemphasis improvement, or
simply as emphasis improvement. It is usually denoted by P, or [P]
decibels, and gives the reduction in the total postdetection noise pow-
er. Preemphasis curves for FDM/FM telephony are given in CCIR

channel in multichannel telephony, 13.1 dB for 525-line TV, and 13.0
dB for 625-line TV. Taking into account the emphasis improvement,

Noise weighting
Another factor that generally improves the postdetection signal-to-
noise ratio is referred to as noise weighting. This is the way in which
the flat noise spectrum has to be modified to take into account the fre-
quency response of the output device and the subjective effect of noise
as perceived by the observer. For example, human hearing is less sen-
sitive to a given noise power density at low and high audio frequencies
than at the middle frequency range.
Weighting curves have been established for various telephone hand-
sets in use by different telephone administrations. One of these, the
CCIR curve, is referred to as the psophometric weighting curve. When
this is applied to the flat noise density spectrum, the noise power is
reduced by 2.5 dB for a 3.1-kHz bandwidth (300–3400 Hz) compared
with flat noise over the same bandwidth. The weighting improvement
factor is denoted by [W], and hence for the CCIR curve [W]  2.5 dB.
(Do not confuse the symbol W here with that used for bandwidth ear-
lier.) For a bandwidth of b kHz, a simple adjustment gives
[W]  2.5  10 log 
 2.41  [b]
(9.14)
Here, b is in kilohertz. A noise weighting factor also can be applied
to TV viewing. The CCIR weighting factors are 11.7 dB for 525-line TV
and 11.2 dB for 625-line TV. Taking weighting into account, Eq. (9.13)

deviation is determined under specified test tone conditions, details of
which will be found in CCIR Recommendation 404-2 (1982). Some val-
ues are shown in Table 9.1.
Because "Frms is determined for a test tone modulation, the peak
deviation for the FDM waveform has to take into account the wave-
form shape through a factor g. This is a voltage ratio that is usually
expressed in decibels. For a small number of channels, g may be as
high as 18.6 dB (Ffthenakis, 1984), and typical values range from 10
to 13 dB. For the number of channels n greater than 24, the value of
10 dB is often used. Denoting the decibel value as gdB, then the volt-
age ratio is obtained from
g  10
(9.17)
The peak deviation also will depend on the number of channels, and
this is taken into account through use of a loading factor L. The rele-
vant CCITT formulas are

Digital Signals
10.1
Introduction
As already mentioned in connection with analog signals, baseband sig-
nals are those signals which occupy the lowest, or base, frequency
band in the frequency spectrum used by the telecommunications net-
work. A baseband signal may consist of one or more information sig-
nals. For example, a number of telephony signals in digital form may
be combined into one baseband signal by the process known as time-
division multiplexing.
Analog signals may be converted into digital signals for transmis-
sion. Digital signals also originate in the form of computer and other
data. In general, a digital signal is a coded version of the original data
or analog signal. In this chapter, the characteristics of the more com-
mon types of digital baseband signals are described, along with repre-
sentative methods of digital modulation.
10.2
Digital Baseband Signals
Digital signals are coded representations of information. Keyboard
characters, for example, are usually encoded in binary digital code. A
binary code has two symbols, usually denoted as 0 and 1, and these are
combined to form binary words to represent the characters. For exam-
ple, a teleprinter code may use the combination 11000 to represent the
letter A.
Analog signals such as speech and video may be converted to a dig-
ital form through an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. A particular
form of A/D conversion is employed, known as pulse-code modulation,

which will be described in detail later. Some of these sources are illus-
trated diagrammatically in Fig. 10.1.
In digital terminology, a binary symbol is known as a binit from
binary digit. The information carried by a binit is, in most practical sit-
uations, equal to a unit of information known as a bit. Thus it has
become common practice to refer to binary symbols as bits rather than
binits, and this practice will be followed here.
The digital information is transmitted as a waveform, some of the
more common waveforms used for binary encoding being shown in
Fig. 10.2. These will be referred to as digital waveforms, although
strictly speaking they are analog representations of the digital infor-
mation being transmitted. The binary sequence shown in Fig. 10.2 is
1010111. Detailed reasons for the use of different waveforms will be
found in most books on digital communications (see, for example,
Bellamy, 1982).
The duration of a bit is referred to as the bit period and is shown as
Tb. The bit rate is given by
Rb 
(10.1)
With Tb in seconds, the bit rate will be in bits per second, usually
denoted by b/s.
Figure 10.2a shows a unipolar waveform, meaning that the wave-
form excursions from zero are always in the same direction, either pos-
itive or negative. They are shown as positive A in Fig. 10.2a. Because

it has a dc component, the unipolar waveform is unsuitable for use on
telephone lines and radio networks, including satellite links.
Figure 10.2b shows a polar waveform, which utilizes positive and
negative polarities. (In Europe this is referred to as a bipolar wave-
form, but the term bipolar in North American usage is reserved for a
specific waveform, described later). For a long, random sequence of 1s
and 0s, the dc component would average out to zero. However, long
sequences of like symbols result in a gradual drift in the dc level,
which creates problems at the receiver decoder. Also, the decoding
process requires knowledge of the bit timing, which is derived from the
zero crossovers in the waveform, and these are obviously absent in
long strings of like symbols. Both the unipolar and polar waveforms
shown in Fig. 10.2a and b are known as nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) wave-

TLFeBOOK

forms. This is so because the waveform does not return to the zero
baseline at any point during the bit period.
Figure 10.2c shows an example of a polar return-to-zero (RZ) wave-
form. Here, the waveform does return to the zero baseline in the mid-
dle of the bit period, so transitions will always occur even within a long
string of like symbols, and bit timing can be extracted. However, dc
drift still occurs with long strings of like symbols.
In the split-phase or Manchester encoding shown in Fig. 10.2d, a
transition between positive and negative levels occurs in the middle of
each bit. This ensures that transitions will always be present so that
bit timing can be extracted, and because each bit is divided equally
between positive and negative levels, there is no dc component.
A comparison of the frequency bandwidths required for digital wave-
forms can be obtained by considering the waveforms which alternate at
the highest rate between the two extreme levels. These will appear as
squarewaves. For the basic polar NRZ waveform of Fig. 10.2b, this hap-
pens when the sequence is…101010.…The periodic time of such a
squarewave is 2Tb, and the fundamental frequency component is f 
1/2Tb. For the split-phase encoding, the squarewave with the highest
repetition frequency occurs with a long sequence of like symbols such
as…1111111…, as shown in Fig. 10.2d. The periodic time of this square-
wave is Tb, and hence the fundamental frequency component is twice
that of the basic polar NRZ. Thus the split-phase encoding requires twice
the bandwidth compared with that for the basic polar NRZ, while the bit
rate remains unchanged. The utilization of bandwidth, measured in bits
per second per hertz, is therefore less efficient.
An alternate mark inversion (AMI) code is shown in Fig. 10.2e. Here,
the binary 0s are at the zero baseline level, and the binary 1s alternate
in polarity. In this way, the dc level is removed, while bit timing can be
extracted easily, except when a long string of zeros occurs. Special tech-
niques are available to counter this last problem. The highest pulse-rep-
etition frequency occurs with a long string of…111111…, the periodic
time of which is 2Tb, the same as the waveform of Fig. 10.2b. The AMI
waveform is also referred to as a bipolar waveform in North America.
Bandwidth requirements may be reduced by utilizing multilevel dig-
ital waveforms. Figure 10.3a shows a polar NRZ signal for the
sequence 11010010. By arranging the bits in groups of two, four levels
can be used. For example, these may be

This is referred to as quarternary encoding, and the waveform is
shown in Fig. 10.3b. The encoding is symmetrical about the zero axis,
the spacing between adjacent levels being 2A. Each level represents a
symbol, the duration of which is the symbol period. For the quar-
ternary waveform the symbol period is seen to be equal to twice the bit
period, and the symbol rate is
Rsym 
(10.2)
The symbol rate is measured in units of bauds, where one baud is one
symbol per second.
The periodic time of the squarewave having the greatest symbol repe-
tition frequency is 2Tsym, which is equal to 4Tb, and hence the bandwidth,
compared with the basic binary waveform, is halved. The bit rate (as dis-
tinct from the symbol rate) remains unchanged, and hence the band-
width utilization in terms of bits per second per hertz is doubled.
In general, a waveform may have M levels (sometimes referred to as
an M-ary waveform), where each symbol represents m bits and

For satellite transmission, the encoded message must be modulated
onto the microwave carrier. Before examining the modulation process,
we describe the way in which speech signals are converted to a digital
format through pulse code modulation.
10.3
Pulse Code Modulation
In the previous section describing baseband digital signals, the infor-
mation was assumed to be encoded in one of the digital waveforms
shown in Figs. 10.2 and 10.3. Speech and video appear naturally as
analog signals, and these must be converted to digital form for trans-
mission over a digital link. In Fig. 10.1 the speech and video analog
signals are shown converted to digital form through the use of analog-
to-digital converters. The particular form of A/D conversion used is
known as pulse-code modulation (PCM). Commercially available inte-
grated circuits known as PCM codecs (for coder-decoder) are used to
implement PCM. Figure 10.4a shows a block schematic for the
Motorola MC145500 series of codecs suitable for speech signals. The
analog signal enters at the Tx terminals and passes through a low-
pass filter, followed by a high-pass filter to remove any 50/60-Hz inter-
ference which may appear on the line. The low-pass filter has a cutoff
frequency of about 4 kHz, which allows for the filter rolloff above the
audio limit of 3400 Hz. As shown in connection with single-sideband
systems, a voice channel bandwidth extending from 300 to 3400 Hz is
considered satisfactory for speech. Band limiting the audio signal in
this way reduces noise. It has another important consequence associ-
ated with the analog-to-digital conversion process. The analog signal
is digitized by taking samples at periodic intervals. A theorem, known
as the sampling theorem, states in part that the sampling frequency
must be at least twice the highest frequency in the spectrum of the sig-
nal being sampled. With the upper cutoff frequency of the audio filter
at 4 kHz, the sampling frequency can be standardized at 8 kHz.
The sampled voltage levels are encoded as binary digital numbers in
the A/D converter following the high-pass filter. The binary number
which is transmitted actually represents a range of voltages, and all
samples which fall within this range are encoded as the same number.

This process, referred to as quantization, obviously will introduce
some distortion (termed quantization noise) into the signal. In a prop-
erly designed system, the quantization noise is kept well within
acceptable limits. The quantization steps follow a nonlinear law, with
large signals being quantized into coarser steps than small signals.
This is termed compression, and it is introduced to keep the signal-to-
quantization noise ratio reasonably constant over the full dynamic
range of the input signal while maintaining the same number of bits
per codeword. At the receiver (the D/A block in Fig. 10.4), the binary
codewords are automatically decoded into the larger quantized steps
for the larger signals, this being termed expansion. The expansion law
is the inverse of the compression law, and the combined processing is
termed companding.
Figure 10.4b shows how the MC145500 codec achieves compression
by using a chorded approximation. The leading bit of the digital code-
word is a sign bit, being 1 for positive and 0 for negative samples of the
analog signal. The next three bits are used to encode the chord in which
the analog signal falls, the three bits giving a total of eight chords. Each
chord is made to cover the same number of input steps, but the step size
increases from chord to chord. The chord bits are followed by four bits
indicating the step in which the analog value lies. The normalized deci-
sion levels shown in Fig. 10.4b are the analog levels at which the com-
parator circuits change from one chord to the next and from one step to
the next. These are normalized to a value 8159 for convenience in pre-
sentation. For example, the maximum value may be considered to be
8159 mV, and then the smallest step would be 1 mV. The first step is
shown as 1 (mV), but it should be kept in mind that the first quantized
level spans the analog zero so that 0 must be distinguished from 0.
Thus the level representing zero has in fact a step size of ±1 mV.
As an example, suppose the sampled analog signal has a value 500
mV. This falls within the normalized range 479 to 511 mV, and there-
fore, the binary code is 10111111. It should be mentioned that normal-
ly the first step in a chord would be encoded 0000, but the bits are
inverted, as noted in Fig. 10.4b. This is so because low values are more
likely than high values, and inversion increases the 1-bit density,
which helps in maintaining synchronization.
The table in Fig. 10.4b shows mu-law encode-decode characteristics.
The term mu law, usually written as  law, originated with older ana-
log compressors, where  was a parameter in the equation describing
the compression characteristic. The -law characteristic is standard in
North America and Japan, while in Europe and many other parts of the
world a similar law known as the A law is in use. Figure 10.5 shows the
curves for   255 and A  87.6, which are the standard values in use.
These are shown as smooth curves, which could be approached with the

older analog compression circuits. The chorded approximation
approaches these in straight-line segments, or chords, for each step.
Because of the similarity of the A-law and -law curves, the speech
quality, as affected by companding, will be similar in both systems, but
otherwise the systems are incompatible, and conversion circuitry is
required for interconnections such as might occur with international
traffic. The MC145500 can be configured for use with either law
through appropriate pin selections, but of course the transmitting and
receiving functions must be configured for the same law.
In the receiver, the output from the D/A converter is passed through
a low-pass filter which selects the original analog spectrum from the
quantized signal. Its characteristics are similar to those of the low-
pass filter used in the transmitter. Apart from the quantization noise
(which should be negligible), the final output is a replica of the filtered
analog signal at the transmitter.
With a sampling rate of 8 kHz or 8000 samples per second and 8 bits
for each sample codeword, the bit rate for a single-channel PCM signal is
Rb  8000  8  64 kb/s

The frequency spectrum occupied by a digital signal is proportion-
al to the bit rate, and in order to conserve bandwidth, it may be nec-
essary to reduce the bit rate. For example, if 7-bit codewords were to
be used, the bit rate would be 56 kb/s. Various data reduction
schemes are in use which give much greater reductions, and some of
these can achieve bit rates as low as 2400 b/s (Hassanein et al., 1989
and 1992).
10.4
Time-Division Multiplexing
A number of signals in binary digital form can be transmitted through
a common channel by interleaving the pulses in time, this being
referred to as time-division multiplexing (TDM). For speech signals, a
separate codec may be used for each voice channel, the outputs from
these being combined to form a TDM baseband signal, as shown in Fig.
10.6. At the baseband level in the receiver, the TDM signal is demulti-
plexed, the PCM signals being routed to separate codecs for decoding.
In satellite systems, the TDM waveform is used to modulate the carri-
er wave, as described later.
The time-division multiplexed signal format is best described with
reference to the widely used Bell T1 system. The signal format is illus-
trated in Fig. 10.7a. Each PCM word contains 8 bits, and a frame con-
tains 24 PCM channels. In addition, a periodic frame synchronizing
signal must be transmitted, and this is achieved by inserting a bit from
the frame synchronizing codeword at the beginning of every frame. At
the receiver, a special detector termed a correlator is used to detect the
frame synchronizing codeword in the bit stream, which enables the

frame timing to be established. The total number of bits in a frame is
therefore 24  8  1  193. Now, as established earlier, the sampling
frequency for voice is 8 kHz, and so the interval between PCM words
for a given channel is 1/8000  125 s. For example, the leading bit in
the PCM codewords for a given channel must be separated in time by
no more than 125 s. As can be seen from Fig. 10.7a, this is also the
frame period, and therefore, the bit rate for the T1 system is
Rb 
 1.544 Mb/s
(10.7)
Signaling information is also carried as part of the digital stream.
By signaling is meant such data as number dialed, busy signals, and
billing information. Signaling can take place at a lower bit rate, and in
the T1 system, the eighth bit for every channel, in every sixth frame,
is replaced by a signaling bit. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.7b. The time
separation between signaling bits is 6  125 s  750 s, and the sig-
naling bit rate is therefore 1/750 s  1.333 kb/s.
10.5
Bandwidth Requirements
In a satellite transmission system, the baseband signal is modulated
onto a carrier for transmission. Filtering of the signals takes place at
a number of stages. The baseband signal itself is band-limited by fil-

tering to prevent the generation of excessive sidebands in the modula-
tion process. The modulated signal undergoes bandpass filtering as
part of the amplification process in the transmitter.
Where transmission lines form the channel, the frequency response
of the lines also must be taken into account. With a satellite link, the
main channel is the radiofrequency path, which has little effect on the
frequency spectrum but does introduce a propagation delay which
must be taken into account.
At the receive end, bandpass filtering of the incoming signal is nec-
essary to limit the noise which is introduced at this stage. Thus the
signal passes through a number of filtering stages, and the effect of
these on the digital waveform must be taken into account.
The spectrum of the output pulse at the receiver is determined by
the spectrum of the input pulse Vi(f), the transmit filter response HT(f),
the channel frequency response HCH(f), and the receiver filter response
HR(f). These are shown in Fig. 10.8. Thus
V (f)  Vi (f) HT (f) HCH (f) HR (f)
(10.8)
Inductive and capacitive elements are an inherent part of the filter-
ing process. These do not dissipate power, but energy is periodically
cycled between the magnetic and electric fields and the signal. The
time required for this energy exchange results in part of the signal
being delayed so that a square pulse entering at the transmitting end
may exhibit “ringing” as it exits at the receiving end. This is illustrat-
ed in Fig. 10.9a.
Because the information is digitally encoded in the waveform, the
distortion apparent in the pulse shape is not important as long as the
receiver can distinguish the binary 1 pulse from the binary 0 pulse.
This requires the waveform to be sampled at the correct instants in
order to determine its polarity. With a continuous waveform, the “tails”
which result from the “ringing” of all the preceding pulses can combine
to interfere with the particular pulse being sampled. This is known as
intersymbol interference (ISI), and it can be severe enough to produce
an error in the detected signal polarity.
The ringing cannot be removed, but the pulses can be shaped such
that the sampling of a given pulse occurs when the tails are at zero
crossover points. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.9b, where two tails are
shown overlapping the pulse being sampled. In practice, perfect pulse

shaping cannot be achieved, so some ISI occurs, but it can be reduced
to negligible proportions.
The pulse shaping is carried out by controlling the spectrum of
the received pulse as given by Eq. (10.8). One theoretical model for
the spectrum is known as the raised cosine response, which is
shown in Fig. 10.10. Although a theoretical model, it can be
approached closely with practical designs. The raised cosine spec-
trum is described by

(10.13)
For a rolloff factor of unity, the bandwidth for the T1 system becomes
1.544 MHz.
Although a satellite link requires the use of a modulated carrier
wave, the same overall baseband response is needed for the avoidance
of ISI. Fortunately, the channel for a satellite link does not introduce
frequency distortion, so the pulse shaping can take place in the trans-
mit and receive filters. The modulation of the baseband signal onto a
carrier is discussed in the next section.
10.6
Digital Carrier Systems
For transmission to and from a satellite, the baseband digital signal
must be modulated onto a microwave carrier. In general, the digital
baseband signals may be multilevel (M-ary), requiring multilevel
modulation methods. The main binary modulation methods are illus-
trated in Fig. 10.11. They are defined as follows:

On-off keying (OOK), also known as amplitude-shift keying (ASK).
The
binary signal in this case is unipolar and is used to switch the carrier
on and off.
Frequency-shift keying (FSK).
The binary signal is used to frequency
modulate the carrier, one frequency being used for a binary 1 and
another for a binary 0. These are also referred to as the mark-space
frequencies.
Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK).
Polarity changes in the binary signal
are used to produce 180° changes in the carrier phase. This may be
achieved through the use of double-sideband, suppressed-carrier mod-
ulation (DSBSC), with the binary signal as a polar NRZ waveform. In
effect, the carrier amplitude is multiplied by a ±1 pulsed waveform.

TLFeBOOK

When the binary signal is 1, the carrier sinusoid is unchanged, and
when it is 1, the carrier sinusoid is changed in phase by 180°. Binary
phase-shift keying is also known as phase-reversal keying (PRK). The
binary signal may be filtered at baseband before modulation, to limit
the sidebands produced, and as part of the filtering needed for the
reduction of ISI, as described in Sec. 10.5. The resulting modulated
waveform is sketched in Fig. 10.11.
Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK).
This is phase-shift keying in
which the phase of the carrier is changed only if the current bit differs
from the previous one. A reference bit must be sent at the start of mes-
sage, but otherwise the method has the advantage of not requiring a
reference carrier at the receiver for demodulation.
Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK).
This is phase-shift keying for a
4-symbol waveform, adjacent phase shifts being equispaced by 90°.
The concept can be extended to more than four levels, when it is denot-
ed as MPSK for M-ary phase-shift keying.
Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
This is also a multilevel
(meaning higher than binary) modulation method in which the ampli-
tude and the phase of the carrier are modulated.
Although all the methods mentioned find specific applications in
practice, only BPSK and QPSK will be described here, since many of
the general properties can be illustrated through these methods, and
they are widely used.
10.6.1
Binary phase-shift keying
Binary phase-shift keying may be achieved by using the binary polar
NRZ signal to multiply the carrier, as shown in Fig. 10.12a. For a bina-
ry signal p(t), the modulated wave may be written as
e (t)  p (t) cos 
0t
(10.14)
When p(t)   1, e(t)  cos 
0t, and when p(t)  1, e(t)  cos 
0t,
which is equivalent to cos (
0t ± 180°). Bandpass filtering (BPF) of the
modulated wave may be used instead of baseband filtering to limit the
radiated spectrum. The bandpass filter also may incorporate the
square root of the raised-cosine rolloff, described in Sec. 10.5, required
to reduce ISI (see, for example, Pratt and Bostian, 1986).
At the receiver (Fig. 10.12b), the received modulated carrier will
undergo further bandpass filtering to complete the raised-cosine
response and to limit input noise. The filtered modulated wave, e′(t) 
266
Chapter Ten
TLFeBOOK

p′(t) cos 
0t, is passed into another multiplier circuit, where it is multi-
plied by a replica of the carrier wave cos 
0t. The output from the mul-
tiplier is therefore equal to p′(t) cos2
0t. This can be expanded as p′(t)(0.5
 0.5 cos 2
0t). The low-pass filter is used to remove the second har-
monic component of the carrier, leaving the low-frequency output, which
is 0.5p′(t), where p′(t) is the filtered version of the input binary wave p(t).
It will be seen that the modulator is basically the same as that used to
produce the DSBSC signal described in Sec. 9.3. In the present instance,
the bandpass filter following the modulator is used to select the com-
plete DSBSC signal rather than a single sideband.
The receiver is shown in more detail in Fig. 10.13. As shown, a local-
ly generated version of the unmodulated carrier wave is required as
one of the inputs to the multiplier. The locally generated carrier has to
be exactly in phase with the incoming carrier, and hence this type of
detection is termed coherent detection. Coherent detection necessitates
recovering the unmodulated carrier phase information from the incom-
ing modulated wave, and this is achieved in the carrier recovery (CR)
section shown in Fig. 10.13.
As discussed in Sec. 10.5, to avoid ISI, sampling must be carried out at
the bit rate and at the peaks of the output pulses. This requires the sam-
ple-and-hold circuit to be accurately synchronized to the bit rate, which
necessitates a bit timing recovery (BTR) section, as shown in Fig. 10.13.
Thermal noise at the receiver will result in noise phase modulation
of the carrier, and so the demodulated waveform p′(t) will be accompa-
nied by noise. The noisy p′(t) signal is passed into the threshold detec-
tor which regenerates a noise-free output but one containing some bit
errors as a result of the noise already present on the waveform.

The QPSK signal has many features in common with BPSK and will
be examined before describing in detail the carrier and bit timing
recovery circuits and the effects of noise.
10.6.2
Quadrature phase-shift keying
With quadrature phase-shift keying, the binary data are converted
into 2-bit symbols which are then used to phase modulate the carrier.
Since four combinations containing 2 bits are possible from a binary
alphabet (logical 1s and 0s), the carrier phase can be shifted to one of
four states.
Figure 10.14a shows one way in which QPSK modulation can be
achieved. The incoming bit stream p(t) is converted in the serial-to-
parallel converter into two binary streams. The conversion is illus-
trated by the waveforms of Fig. 10.14b. For illustration purposes, the
bits in the p(t) waveform are labeled a, b, c, d, e, and f. The serial-to-
parallel converter switches bit a to the I port and at the same time
switches bit b to the Q port. In the process, each bit duration is dou-
bled, so the bit rates at the I and Q outputs are half that of the input
bit rate.
The pi(t) bit stream is combined with a carrier cos 
0t in a BPSK
modulator, while the pq(t) bit stream is combined with a carrier sin 
0t,
also in a BPSK modulator. These two BPSK waveforms are added to
give the QPSK wave, the various combinations being shown in Table
10.1.
The phase-modulation angles are shown in the phasor diagram of
Fig. 10.15. Because the output from the I port modulates the carrier
directly, it is termed the in-phase component, and hence the designa-
tion I. The output from the Q port modulates a quadrature carrier, one

which is shifted by 90° from the reference carrier, and hence the des-
ignation Q.
Because the modulation is carried out at half the bit rate of the incom-
ing data, the bandwidth required by the QPSK signal is exactly half
that required by a BPSK signal carrying the same input data. This is
the advantage of QPSK compared with BPSK modulation. The disad-
vantage is that the modulator and demodulator circuits are more com-
plicated, being equivalent essentially to two BPSK systems in parallel.
Demodulation of the QPSK signal may be carried out by the circuit
shown in the block schematic of Fig. 10.16. With the incoming carrier
represented as pi(t) cos 
0t  pq(t) sin 
0t, it is easily shown that after
low-pass filtering, the output of the upper BPSK demodulator is
0.5pi(t) and the output of the lower BPSK demodulator is 0.5pq(t).
These two signals are combined in the parallel-to-serial converter to
yield the desired output p(t). As with the BPSK signal, noise will cre-
ate errors in the demodulated output of the QPSK signal.

10.6.3
Transmission rate and bandwidth
for PSK modulation
Equation (10.14), which shows the baseband signal p(t) multiplied onto
the carrier cos 
0t, is equivalent to double-sideband, suppressed-carri-
er modulation. The digital modulator circuit of Fig. 10.12a is similar to
the single-sideband modulator circuit shown in Fig. 9.2, the difference
being that after the multiplier, the digital modulator requires a band-
pass filter, while the analog modulator requires a single-sideband filter.
As shown in Fig. 9.1, the DSBSC spectrum extends to twice the high-
est frequency in the baseband spectrum. For BPSK modulation the lat-
ter is given by Eq. (10.11) with Rsym replaced with Rb:
BIF  2B  (1  ) Rb
(10.15)
Thus, for BPSK with a rolloff factor of unity, the IF bandwidth in hertz
is equal to twice the bit rate in bits per second.
As shown in the previous section, QPSK is equivalent to the sum of
two orthogonal BPSK carriers, each modulated at a rate Rb/2, and
therefore, the symbol rate is Rsym  Rb/2. The spectra of the two BPSK
modulated waves overlap exactly, but interference is avoided at the
receiver because of the coherent detection using quadrature carriers.
Equation (10.15) is modified for QPSK to
BIF  (1  ) Rsym
(10.16)

Rb
An important characteristic of any digital modulation scheme is
the ratio of data bit rate to transmission bandwidth. The units for
this ratio are usually quoted as bits per second per hertz (a dimen-
sionless ratio in fact because it is equivalent to bits per cycle). Note
that it is the data bit rate Rb and not the symbol rate Rsym which is
used.
For BPSK, Eq. (10.15) gives an Rb/BIF ratio of 1/(1  ), and for
QPSK, Eq. (10.16) gives an Rb/BIF ratio of 2/(1  ). Thus QPSK is twice
as efficient as BPSK in this respect. However, more complex equipment
is required to generate and detect the QSPK modulated signal.
10.6.4
Bit error rate for PSK modulation
Referring back to Fig. 10.13, the noise at the input to the receiver can
cause errors in the detected signal. The noise voltage, which adds to
the signal, fluctuates randomly between positive and negative values,
and thus the sampled value of signal plus noise may have the opposite
polarity to that of the signal alone. This would constitute an error in

the received pulse. The noise can be represented by a source at the
front of the receiver, shown in Fig. 10.13 (this is considered in more
detail in Chap. 12). It is seen that the noise is filtered by the receiver
input filter. Thus the receive filter, in addition to contributing to min-
imizing the ISI, must minimize noise while maximizing the received
signal. In short, it must maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio. In
practice for satellite links (or radio links), this usually can be achieved
by making the transmit and receive filters identical, each having a fre-
quency response which is the square root of the raised-cosine response.
Having identical filters is an advantage from the point of view of man-
ufacturing.
The most commonly encountered type of noise has a flat frequency
spectrum, meaning that the noise power spectrum density, measured
in joules (or watts per hertz), is constant. The noise spectrum density
will be denoted by No. When the filtering is designed to maximize the
received signal-to-noise ratio, the maximum signal-to-noise voltage
ratio is found to be equal to 2Eb/N
o, where Eb is the average bit ener-
gy. The average bit energy can be calculated knowing the average
received power PR and the bit period Tb:

is given by

where erfc stands for complementary error function, whose value is

Equation (10.18) applies for polar NRZ baseband signals and for
BPSK and QPSK modulation systems. The probability of bit error is
also referred to as the bit error rate (BER). A Pe  106 signifies a BER
of 1 bit in a million, on average. The graph of Pe versus Eb/No in deci-
bels is shown in Fig. 10.17. Note carefully that the energy ratio, not
the decibel value, of Eb/No must be used in Eq. (10.18). This is illus-
trated in the following Mathcad example.

An important parameter for carrier systems is the ratio of the
average carrier power to the noise power density, usually denoted
by [C/No]. The [Eb/No] and [C/No] ratios can be related as follows.
The average carrier power at the receiver is PR watts. The energy
per symbol is therefore PR/Rsym joules, with Rsym in symbols per sec-
ond. Since each symbol contains m bits, the energy per bit is

The equations giving the probability of bit error are derived on the
basis that the filtering provides maximum signal-to-noise ratio. In
practice, there are a number of reasons why the optimal filtering may
not be achieved. The raised-cosine response is a theoretical model that
can only be approximated in practice. Also, for economic reasons, it is
desirable to use production filters manufactured to the same specifi-
cations for the transmit and receive filter functions, and this may
result in some deviation from the desired theoretical response. The
usual approach in practice is that one knows the BER that is accept-
able for a given application. The corresponding ratio of bit energy to
noise density can then be found from Eq. (10.18) or from a graph such
as that shown in Fig. 10.17. Once the theoretical value of Eb/No is
found, an implementation margin, amounting to a few decibels at
most, is added to allow for imperfections in the filtering. This is illus-
trated in the following example.

A BPSK satellite digital link is required to operate with a
bit error rate of no more than 105, the implementation margin being 2 dB.

The graph of Fig. 10.17 shows that Eb/No is around 9 dB for a
BER of 105. By plotting this region to an expanded scale, a more accurate
value of Eb/No can be obtained. For ease of presentation, the Eb/No ratio will
be denoted by x. A suitable range for x is
x:  8, 8.2.. 10
In decibels, this is
xdB (x) :  10  log (x)
Equation (10.18) gives

This is plotted in Fig. 10.18, from which Eb/No is seen to be close to 9.6 dB.
This is without an implementation margin. The required value, including
an implementation margin, is 9.6  2  11.6 dB.
To summarize, BER is a specified requirement, which enables Eb/No
to be determined by using Eq. (10.18) or Fig. 10.17. The rate Rb also
will be specified, and hence the [C/No] ratio can be found by using Eq.
(10.24). The [C/No] ratio is then used in the link budget calculations,
as described in Chap. 12.

With purely digital systems, the BER will be directly reflected in
errors in the data being transmitted. With analog signals which have
been converted to digital form through PCM, the BER contributes to
the output signal-to-noise ratio, along with the quantization noise, as
described in Sec. 10.3. Curves showing the contributions of thermal
noise and quantization noise to the signal-to-noise output for analog
systems are in Fig. 10.19. The signal-to-noise power ratio is given by

where Q  2n is the number of quantized steps, and n is the number
of bits per sample.
The BER can be improved through the use of error control coding.
This is the topic of Chap. 11.

Carrier Recovery Circuits
To implement coherent detection, a local oscillator that is exactly syn-
chronized to the carrier must be provided at the receiver. As shown in
Sec. 10.6.1, a BPSK signal is a double sideband suppressed carrier
(DSBSC) type of signal, and therefore, the carrier is not directly avail-
able in the BPSK signal. The carrier can be recovered using a squar-
ing loop, as shown in Fig.10.20. Consider first the situation where the
input is a BPSK signal. The frequency multiplier is a nonlinear circuit,
which squares the signal. Squaring Eq. (10.14) results in

Note that with p(t) equal to ±1, the square is just 1. The bandpass
filter following the frequency multiplier is tuned to the carrier second
harmonic, which provides one of the inputs to the phase detector of the
phase-locked loop. The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the
phase-locked loop (PLL) operates at the carrier frequency. The second
frequency multiplier provides the second harmonic of this as the other
input to the phase detector. The phase difference between these two
inputs generates a bias voltage that brings the frequency of the VCO
into synchronism with the carrier frequency as derived from the BPSK
signal.
With QPSK, the signal can be represented by the formulas given in
Table 10.1, which may be written generally as
e (t)  2 cos (

(10.27)

(10.29)
This is seen to consist of the fourth harmonic of the carrier, including
a constant-phase term that can be ignored. The fourth harmonic is
selected by the bandpass filter, and the operation of the circuit pro-
ceeds in a similar manner to that for the BPSK signal.
Frequency multiplication can be avoided by use of a method known
as the Costas loop. Details of this, along with an analysis of the effects
of noise on the squaring loop and the Costas loop methods, will be
found in Gagliardi (1991). Other methods are also described in detail
in Franks (1980).
10.8
Bit Timing Recovery
Accurate bit timing is needed at the receiver in order to be able to
sample the received waveform at the optimal points. In the most com-
mon arrangements, the clocking signal is recovered from the demod-
ulated waveform, these being known as self-clocking or self-
synchronizing systems. Where the waveform has a high density of

zero crossings, a zero-crossing detector can be used to recover the
clocking signal. In practice, the received waveform is often badly dis-
torted by the frequency response of the transmission link and by
noise, and the design of the bit timing recovery circuit is quite com-
plicated. In most instances, the spectrum of the received waveform
will not contain a discrete component at the clock frequency. However,
it can be shown that a periodic component at the clocking frequency
is present in the squared waveform for digital signals (unless the
received pulses are exactly rectangular, in which case squaring sim-
ply produces a dc level for a binary waveform). A commonly used base-
band scheme is shown in block schematic form in Fig. 10.21 (Franks,
1980). The filters A and B form part of the normal signal filtering
(e.g., raised-cosine filtering). The signal for the bit timing recovery is
tapped from the junction between A and B and passed along a sepa-
rate branch which consists of a filter, a squaring circuit, and a band-
pass filter which is sharply tuned to the clock frequency component
present in the spectrum of the squared signal. This is then used to
synchronize the clocking circuit, the output of which clocks the sam-
pler in the detector branch.
The early-late gate circuit provides a method of recovering bit timing
which does not rely on a clocking component in the spectrum of the
received waveform. The circuit utilizes a feedback loop in which the
magnitude changes in the outputs from matched filters control the fre-
quency of a local clocking circuit (for an elementary description see, for
example, Roddy and Coolen, 1995). Detailed analyses of these and oth-
er methods will be found in Franks (1980) and Gagliardi (1991).

Error Control Coding
11.1
Introduction
As shown by Fig. 10.17, the probability of bit error (Pe) in a digital trans-
mission can be reduced by increasing [Eb/No], but there are practical
limits to this approach. Equation (10.24) shows that for a given bit rate
Rb, [Eb/No] is directly proportional to [C/No]. An increase in [C/No] can
be achieved by increasing transmitted power and/or reducing the sys-
tem noise temperature (to reduce No). Both these measures are limited
by cost and, in the case of the onboard satellite equipment, size. In
practical terms, a probability of bit error (Pe of Eq. 10.18) of about 104,
which is satisfactory for voice transmissions, can be achieved with off-
the-shelf equipment. For lower Pe values such as required for some
data, error control coding must be used. Error control performs two
functions, error detection and error correction. Most codes can perform
both functions, but not necessarily together. In general, a code is capa-
ble of detecting more errors than it can correct. Where error detection
only is employed, the receiver can request a repeat transmission (a
technique referred to as automatic repeat request, or ARQ). This is only
of limited use in satellite communications because of the long trans-
mission delay time associated with geostationary satellites. What is
termed forward error correction (FEC) allows errors to be corrected
without the need for retransmission, but this is more difficult and
costly to implement than ARQ.
A Pe value of 104 represents an average error rate of 1 bit in 104, and
the error performance is sometimes specified as the bit error rate (BER).
It should be recognized, however, that the probability of bit error Pe
occurs as a result of noise at the input to the receiver, while the BER is
the actual error rate at the output of the detector. When error control
Chapter11

TLFeBOOK

coding is employed, the distinction between Pe and BER becomes impor-
tant. Pe is still determined by conditions at the input, but the error con-
trol will, if properly implemented, make the probability of bit error at the
output (the BER) less than that at the input. Error control coding applies
only to digital signals, and in most cases the signal is in binary form,
where the message symbols are bits, or logic 1s and 0s.
Encoding refers to the process of adding coding bits to the uncoded
bit stream, and decoding refers to the process of recovering the original
(uncoded) bit stream from the coded bit stream. Both processes are usu-
ally combined in one unit termed a codec.
11.2
Linear Block Codes
A block code requires that the message stream be partitioned into
blocks of bits (considering only binary messages at this stage). Let each
block contain k bits, and let these k bits define a dataword. The num-
ber of datawords is 2k. There is no redundancy in the system, meaning
that even a single bit error in transmission would convert one dataword
into another, which of course would constitute an error.
The datawords can be encoded into codewords which consist of n bits,
where n  k  r. The additional r bits are derived from the message bits
but are not part of the message. The number of possible codewords is
2n, but only 2k of these will contain datawords, and these are the ones
that are transmitted. It follows that the rest of the codewords are
redundant, but only in the sense that they do not contribute to the mes-
sage. (The r additional bits are referred to as redundant bits and are
also known as parity check bits.) If now errors occur in transmission,
there is high probability that they will convert the permissible code-
words into one or another of the redundant words that the decoder at
the receiver is designed to recognize as an error. It will be noted that
the term high probability is used. There is always the possibility, how-
ever remote, that enough errors occur to transform a transmitted code-
word into another legitimate codeword in error.
As a matter of definition, a code is termed linear when any linear
combination of two codewords is also a codeword. For binary codewords
in particular, the linear operation encountered is modulo-2 addition.
All codes encountered in practice are linear, which has a bearing on the
theoretical development (see, for example Proakis and Salehi, 1994).
The definition is given here for completeness. The theoretical work is
not required because only the practical properties of interest in satel-
lite communications are described.
A repetition code illustrates some of the general properties of block
codes. In a repetition code, each bit is considered to be a dataword, in
effect, k  1. For n-redundancy encoding, the output of the encoder is n
284
Chapter Eleven
TLFeBOOK

bits, identical to the input bit. As an example, consider the situation
when n  3. A binary 1 at the input to the encoder results in a 111 code-
word at the output, and a binary 0 at the input results in a 000 code-
word at the output. At the receiver, the logic circuits in the decoder
produce a 1 when 111 is present at the input and a 0 when 000 is pre-
sent. It is assumed that synchronization is maintained between
encoder and decoder. If a codeword other than 111 or 000 is received,
the decoder detects an error and can request a retransmission (ARQ).
Forward error correction (FEC) can take place on the basis of a
“majority vote.” In this case, the logic circuits in the decoder are
designed to produce a 1 at the output whenever two or three 1s occur
in the received codeword (codewords 111, 101, 011, and 110) and a 0
whenever two or three 0s appear in the codeword (codewords 000, 001,
010, and 100). An odd number of “repeats” is used to avoid a tied vote.
Errors can still get through if the noise results in two or three suc-
cessive errors in a codeword. For example, if the noise changes a 111
into a 000 or a 000 into a 111, the output will be in error whether error
detection or forward error correction (FEC) is used. If two errors occur
in a codeword, then the “majority vote” method for FEC will result in
an error. However, the probability of two or three consecutive errors
occurring is very much less than the probability of a single error. This
assumes that the bit energy stays the same, an aspect that is discussed
in Sec. 11.7.
The code rate rc is defined as the ratio of dataword bits to codeword bits
(note that although it is called a rate, it is not a rate in bits per second):
rc 
(11.1)
For a given level of performance (i.e., number of errors detected or cor-
rected), the greater the code rate, the more efficient is the code. Codes
that are more efficient than repetitive encoding are used in practice.
11.3
Cyclic Codes
Cyclic codes are a subclass of linear block codes. They possess the prop-
erty that a cyclic shift of a codeword is also a codeword. For example, if
a codeword consists of the elements {c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7}, then {c2 c3 c4 c5 c6
c7 c1} is also a codeword. The advantage of cyclic codes is that they are
easily implemented in practice through the use of shift registers and
modulo-2 adders. Cyclic codes are widely used in satellite transmis-
sion, and the properties of the most important of these are summarized
in the following sections. Only certain combinations of k and n are per-
mitted in these codes. As pointed out in Taub and Schilling (1986), a
code is an invention, and these codes are named after their inventors.

It will be seen that the code rate rc  k/n approaches unity as m
increases, which leads to more efficient coding. However, only a single
error can be corrected with Hamming codes.
11.3.2
BCH codes
BCH stands for the names of the inventors, Bose, Chaudhuri, and
Hocquenghen. These codes can correct up to t errors, and where m is
any positive integer, the permissible values are n  2m  1 and k  n
 mt. The integers m and t are arbitrary, which gives the code designer
considerable flexibility in choice. Proakis and Salehi (1994) give an
extensive listing of the parameters for BCH codes, from which the fol-
lowing values have been obtained:

11.3.3
Reed-Solomon codes
The codes described so far work well with errors that occur randomly
rather than in bursts. However, there are situations where errors do
occur in bursts; that is, a number of bits that are close together may
experience errors as a result of impulse-type noise or impulse-type
interference. Reed-Solomon (R-S) codes are designed to correct errors
under these conditions. Instead of encoding directly in bits, the bits are
grouped into symbols, and the datawords and codewords are encoded
286
Chapter Eleven
TLFeBOOK

in these symbols. Errors affecting a group of bits are most likely to
affect only one symbol that can be corrected by the R-S code.
Let the number of bits per symbol be k; then the number of possible
symbols is q  2k (referred to as a q-ary alphabet). Let K be the number
of symbols in a dataword and N be the number of symbols in a code-
word. Just as in the block code where k-bit datawords were mapped
into n-bit codewords, with the R-S code, datawords of K symbols are
mapped into codewords of N symbols. The additional N  K redundant
symbols are derived from the message symbols but are not part of the
message. The number of possible codewords is 2N, but only 2K of these
will contain datawords, and these are the ones that are transmitted. It
follows that the rest of the codewords are redundant, but only in the
sense that they do not contribute to the message. If now errors occur in
transmission, there is high probability that they will convert the per-
missible codewords into one or another of the redundant words that the
decoder at the receiver is designed to recognize as an error. It will be
noted that the term high probability is used. There is always the pos-
sibility, however remote, that enough errors occur to transform a trans-
mitted codeword into another legitimate codeword even though this
was not the one transmitted.
It will be observed that the wording of the preceding paragraph par-
allels that given in Sec. 11.2 on block codes, except that here the coding
is carried out on symbols. Some of the design rules for the R-S codes are
q  2k
N  q  1
2t  N  K
Here, t is the number of symbol errors that can be corrected. A simple
example will be given to illustrate these. Let k  2; then q  4, and
these four symbols may be labeled A, B, C, and D. In terms of the binary
symbols (bits) for this simple case, we could have A  00, B  01, C 
10, and D  11. One could imagine the binary numbers 00, 01, 10, and
11 being stored in memory locations labeled A, B, C, and D.
The number of symbols per codeword is N  q  1  3. Suppose that
t  1; then the rule 2t  N  K gives K  1; that is, there will be one
symbol per dataword. Hence the number of datawords is qK  4 (i.e., A,
B, C, or D), and the number of codewords is qN  43  64. These will
include permissible words of the form AP1P2, BP3P4, CP5P6, and DP7P8,
where P1P2, etc. are the parity symbols selected by the encoding rules
from the symbol alphabet A, B, C, and D. This process is illustrated in
Fig. 11.1.
At the decoder, these are the only words that are recognized as being
legitimate and can be decoded. The other possible codewords not

formed by the rules but which may be formed by transmission errors
will be detected as errors and corrected. It will be observed that a code-
word consists of 6 bits, and one or more of these in error will result in
a symbol error. The R-S code is capable of correcting this symbol error,
which in this simple illustration means that a burst of up to 6 bit errors
can be corrected.
R-S codes do not provide efficient error correction where the errors
are randomly distributed as distinct from occurring in bursts (Taub
and Schilling, 1986). To deal with this situation, codes may be joined
together or concatenated, one providing for random error correction
and one for burst error correction. Concatenated codes are described in
Sec. 11.6.
It should be noted that although the encoder and decoder in R-S codes
operate at the symbol level, the signal may be transmitted as a bit
stream, but it is also suitable for transmission with multilevel modula-
tion, the levels being determined by the symbols. The code rate is rc 
K/N, and the code is denoted by (N, K). In practice, it is often the case
that the symbols are bytes consisting of 8 bits; then q  28  256, and N
 q  1  255. With t  8, a NASA-standard (255, 239) R-S code results.
Shortened R-S codes employ values N′  N  l and K′  K  l and
are denoted as (N′, K′). For example, DirecTV (see Chap. 16) utilizes a
shortened R-S code for which l  109, and digital video broadcast
(DVB) utilizes one for which l  51 (Mead, 2000). These codes are
designed to correct up to t  8 symbol errors.
11.4
Convolution Codes
Convolution codes are also linear codes. A convolution encoder consists
of a shift register which provides temporary storage and a shifting
operation for the input bits and exclusive-OR logic circuits which gen-
erate the coded output from the bits currently held in the shift register.
In general, k data bits may be shifted into the register at once, and n
code bits generated. In practice, it is often the case that k  1 and n 
2, giving rise to a rate 12 code. A rate 12 encoder is illustrated in Fig.
11.2, and this will be used to explain the encoding operation.
Initially, the shift register holds all binary 0s. The input data bits are
fed in continuously at a bit rate Rb, and the shift register is clocked at
this rate. As the input moves through the register, the rightmost bit is
shifted out so that there are always 3 bits held in the register. At the
end of the message, three binary 0s are attached, to return the shift
register to its initial condition. The commutator at the output is
switched at twice the input bit rate so that two output bits are gener-
ated for each input bit shifted in. At any one time the register holds 3
bits which form the inputs to the exclusive-OR circuits.

Figure 11.3 is a tree diagram showing the changes in the shift regis-
ter as input is moved in, with the corresponding output shown in
parentheses. At the initial condition, the register stores 000, and the
output is 00. If the first message bit in is a 1, the lower branch is fol-
lowed, and the output is seen to be 11. Continuing with this example,
suppose that the next three input bits are 001; then the corresponding
output is 01 11 11. In other words, for an input 1001 (shown shaded in
Fig. 11.3), the output, including the initial condition (enclosed here in
brackets), is [00] 11 01 11 11. From this example it will be seen that any
given input bit contributes, for as long as it remains in the shift regis-
ter, to the encoded word. The number of stages in the register gives the
constraint length of the encoder. Denoting the constraint length by m,
the encoder is specified by (n, k, m). The example shows a (2, 1, 3)
encoder. Encoders are optimized through computer simulation.
At the receiver, the tree diagram for the encoder is known. Decoding
proceeds in the reverse manner. If, for example, [00] 11 01 11 11 is
received, the tree is searched for the matching branches, from which
the input can be deduced. Suppose, however, that an error occurs in
transmission, changing the received word to [00] 01 01 11 11; i.e., the
error is in the first bit following the initial condition. The receiver
decoder expects either a 00 or a 11 to follow the initial 00; therefore, it
has to make the assumption that an error has occurred. If it assumes
that 00 was intended, it will follow the upper branch, but now a further
difficulty arises. The next possible pair is 00 or 11, neither of which
matches the received code word. On the other hand, if it assumes that
11 was intended, it takes the lower branch, and then it can match all
the following pairs with the branches in the decoding tree. On the basis
of maximum likelihood, this would be the preferred path, and the cor-
rect input 1001 would be deduced.

Decoding is a more difficult problem than encoding, and as the exam-
ple suggests, the search process could quickly become impracticable for
long messages. The Viterbi algorithm is used widely in practice for
decoding. An example of a commercially available codec is the CDV-
10MIC single-chip codec made by Signal Processors Limited (Signal
Processors, Ltd., 1990). The data sheet for this codec is shown in Fig.
11.4. The CDV-10MIC utilizes Viterbi decoding. It has a constraint
length of 7 and can be adjusted for code rates of 12, 23, and 34 by means
of what is termed punctured coding. With punctured coding, the basic
code is generated at code rate 12, but by selectively discarding some of
the output bits, other rates can be achieved (Mead, 2000). The advan-
tage is that a single encoder can be used for different rates.
11.5
Interleaving
The idea behind interleaving is to change the order in which the bits are
encoded so that a burst of errors gets dispersed across a number of code-
words rather than being concentrated in one codeword. Interleaving as
applied in block codes will be used here to illustrate the technique, but
it also can be used with convolutional coding (Taub and Schilling, 1986).

the bits are labeled from b1 to b24. These are fed into shift registers as
shown in Fig. 11.5b, where, again, for definiteness seven rows and six
columns are shown. Rather than encoding the rows, the columns are
encoded so that the parity bits fill up the last three rows. It will be seen,
therefore, that the bits are not encoded in the order in which they
appear in the data bit stream. The encoded bits are read out row by row
as shown in Fig. 11.5c. Row 4 is shown in detail. If now an error burst
occurs which changes bits b5, b4, and b3, these will appear as separate
errors in the encoded words formed by columns 2, 3, and 4. The words
formed by the column bits are encoded to correct single errors (in this
example), and therefore, the burst of errors has been corrected.

tion. Figure 11.6 shows the general form for concatenated codes. The
input data are fed into the encoder designed for burst error correction.
This is the outer encoder. The output from the outer encoder is fed into
the encoder designed for random error correction. This is the inner
encoder. The signal is then modulated and passed on for transmission.
At the receiver, the signal is demodulated. The inner decoder matches
the inner encoder and follows the demodulator. The output from the
inner decoder is fed into the outer decoder, which matches the outer
encoder. The term outer refers to the outermost encoding/decoding
units in the equipment chain, and the term inner refers to the inner-
most encoding/decoding unit. In digital satellite television, the outer
code is a Reed-Solomon code, and the inner code is a convolutional code.
The inner decoder utilizes Viterbi decoding.

sage. Where error control coding is employed, the message will be
referred to as a coded message, and its parameters will be denoted by
the subscript C. Figure 11.7b shows the arrangement for a coded mes-
sage. For comparison purposes, the [C/No] value is assumed to be the
same for both situations. The input bit rate to the modulator for the
uncoded message is Rb and for the coded message is Rc. Since n code bits
must be transmitted for every k data bits, the bit rates are related as
 rc
(11.2)
Since rc is always less than unity, then Rc  Rb always. For constant
carrier power, the bit energy is inversely proportional to bit rate (see
Eq. 10.22), and therefore,

where Eb is the average bit energy in the uncoded bit stream (as intro-
duced in Chap. 10), and Ec is the bit energy in the coded bit stream.
Equation (10.18) gives the probability of bit error for BPSK and
QPSK modulation. With no coding applied, Eb is just the Eb of Eq.
(10.18), and the probability of bit error in the uncoded bit stream is
PeU 

(11.4)
For the coded bit stream, the bit energy is Ec  rcEb, and therefore, Eq.
(10.18) becomes
PeC 
erfc
(11.5)
This means that PeC  PeU, or the probability of bit error with coding is
worse than that without coding. It is important to note, however, that
the probability of bit error applies at the input to the decoder. For the
error control coding to be effective, the output bit error rate (BER)
should be better than that obtained without coding. More will be said
about this later.
The limitation imposed by bandwidth also must be considered. If the
time for transmission is to be the same for the coded message as for the
uncoded message, the bandwidth has to be increased to accommodate
the higher bit rate. The required bandwidth is directly proportional to
bit rate (see, for example, Eq. 10.16), and hence it has to be increased
by a factor 1/rc. If, however, the bandwidth is fixed (the system is band
limited), then the only recourse is to increase the transmission time by
the factor 1/rc. For a fixed number of bits in the original message, the
bit rate Rb entering into the encoder is reduced by a factor rc compared
with what it could have been without coding.
As an example, it is shown in Sec. 10.4 that the TI message rate is
1.544 Mb/s. When 7/8 FEC is applied, the transmission rate becomes
1.544  8/7  1.765 Mb/s. From Eq. (10.16), the required bandwidth is
BIF  1.765  (1.2)/2  1.06 MHz.
11.8
Coding Gain
As shown by Eqs. (11.4) and (11.5), the probability of bit error for a
coded message is higher (therefore, worse) than that for an uncoded
message, and therefore, to be of advantage, the coding itself must more
than offset this reduction in performance. In order to illustrate this, the
messages will be assumed to be BPSK (or QPSK) so that the expres-

sions for error probabilities as given by Eqs. (11.4) and (11.5) can be
used. Denoting by BERU the bit error rate after demodulation for the
uncoded message and by BERC the bit error rate for the coded message
after demodulation and decoding, then for the uncoded message
BERU  PeU

that can correct one error. For this class of codes and with t  1, Eq.
(11.7) simplifies to

(11.8)
A plot of BERC and BERU against [Eb/No] is shown in Fig. 11.8 for the
Hamming (7, 4) code. The crossover point occurs at about 4 dB, so for
the coding to be effective, [Eb/No] must be higher than this. Also, from
the graph, for a BER of 105, the [Eb/No] is 9 dB for the uncoded mes-
sage and 9.6 dB for the coded message. Therefore, at this BER value
the Hamming code is said to provide a coding gain of 0.6 dB.
Some values for coding gains given in Taub and Schilling (1986) are
block codes, 3 to 5 dB; convolutional coding with Viterbi decoding, 4 to
5.5 dB; concatenated codes using R-S block codes and convolutional
decoding with Viterbi decoding, 6.5 to 7.5 dB. These values are for a Pe
value of 105 and using hard decision decoding as described in the next
section.
11.9
Hard Decision and Soft Decision
Decoding
With hard decision decoding, the output from the optimum demodula-
tor is passed to a threshold detector that generates a “clean” signal, as
shown in Fig. 11.9a. Using triple redundancy again as an example, the
two codewords would be 111 and 000. For binary polar signals, these
might be represented by voltage levels 1 V 1 V 1 V and 1 V 1 V 1
V. The threshold level for the threshold detector would be set at 0 V. If
now the sampled signal from the optimum demodulator is 0.5 V 0.7 V
2 V, the output from the threshold detector would be 1 V 1 V 1 V,
and the decoder would decide that this was a binary 1 1 0 codeword and

produce a binary 1 as output. In other words, a firm or hard decision is
made on each bit at the threshold detector.
With soft decision decoding (Fig. 11.9b), the received codeword is
compared in total with the known codewords in the set, 111 and 000 in
this example. The comparison is made on the basis of minimum dis-
tance. To illustrate this, consider first two points in an x, y, z coordinate
system. Let point P1 have coordinates x1, y1, z1 and point P2 have coor-
dinates x2, y2, z2. From the geometry of the situation, the distance d
between the points is obtained from

Treating the codewords as vectors and comparing the received code-
word on this basis with the stored version of 111 results in

The distance determined in this manner is often referred to as the
Euclidean distance in acknowledgment of its geometric origins, and the
distance squared is known as the Euclidean distance metric. On this
basis, the received codeword is closest to the 000 codeword, and the
decoder would produce a binary 0 output.
Soft decision decoding results in about a 2-dB reduction in the
[Eb/No] required for a given BER (Taub and Schilling, 1986). This ref-
erence also gives a table of comparative values for soft and hard deci-
sion coding for various block and convolutional codes. Clearly, soft

decision decoding is more complex to implement than hard decision
decoding and is only used where the improvement it provides must
be had.
11.10
Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)
Error detection without correction is more efficient than forward error
correction in terms of code utilization. It is less complicated to imple-
ment, and more errors can be detected than corrected. Of course, it
then becomes necessary for the receiver to request a retransmission
when an error has been detected. This is an automatic procedure,
termed automatic repeat request (ARQ). The request for retransmission
must be made over a low-bit-rate channel where the probability of bit
error can be kept negligibly small. Because of the long round-trip delay
time, on the order of half a second or more, encountered with geosta-
tionary satellites, ARQ is only suitable for transmission that is not sen-
sitive to long delays. ARQ is normally used with block encoding.
An estimate of the probability of an error remaining undetected can
be made. With an (n, k) block code, the number of datawords is 2k, and
the total number of codewords is 2n. When a given dataword is trans-
mitted, an undetected error results when the transmission errors con-
vert the received codeword into one that contains a permissible
dataword but not the one that was transmitted. The number of such
datawords is 2k  1. An upper bound on the probability of an error get-
ting through can be made by assuming that all codewords are
equiprobable. The ratio of number of possible error words to total num-
ber of codewords then gives the average probability of error. In practice,
of course, all the codewords will not be equiprobable, those containing
datawords being more probable than those which do not. The ratio,
therefore, gives an upper bound on the probability of error:
BER 
 2 (n  k)
(11.9)
 2r
where r is the number of redundant bits in a codeword. For example, a
(15, 11) code has an upper bound of approximately 0.06, while a (64, 32)
code has an upper bound of approximately 2.3 	 1010.
It will be assumed, therefore, that the data are sent in coded blocks
(referred to simply as blocks in the following). The receiver acknowledges
receipt of each block by sending back a positive acknowledgment or ACK
signal if no errors are detected in the block and a negative acknowledg-
ment or NAK signal if errors are detected. In what is termed stop and

wait ARQ, the transmitter stores a copy of the block just transmitted and
waits for the acknowledgment signal. If a NAK signal is received, it
retransmits the block, and if an ACK signals is received, it transmits the
next block. In either case, the delay between transmissions is about half
a second, the round-trip time to and from a geostationary satellite. This
would be unacceptable in many applications.
What is required is continuous transmission of blocks incorporating
the retransmission of corrupted blocks when these are detected. Go
back N ARQ achieves this by having the blocks and the acknowledg-
ment signals numbered. The transmitter must now be capable of stor-
ing the number of blocks N transmitted over the round-trip time and
updating the storage as each ACK signal is received. If the receiver
detects an error in block i, say, it transmits an NAKi signal and refuses
to accept any further blocks until it has received the correct version of
block i. The transmitter goes back to block i and restarts the transmis-
sion from there. This means that block i and all subsequent blocks are
retransmitted. It is clear that a delay will only be encountered when an
NAK signal is received, but there is the additional time loss resulting
from the retransmission of the good blocks following the corrupted
block. The method can be further improved by using what is termed
selective repeat ARQ, where only a correct version of the corrupted
block is retransmitted, and not the subsequent blocks. This creates a
storage requirement at the receiver because it must be able to store the
subsequent blocks while waiting for the corrected version of the cor-
rupted block.
It should be noted that in addition to the ACK and NAK signals, the
transmitter operates a timeout clock. If the acknowledgment signal
(ACK or NAK) for a given block is not received within the timeout
period, the transmitter puts the ARQ mechanism into operation. This
requires the receiver to be able to identify the blocks so that it recog-
nizes which ones are repeats.
The throughput of an ARQ system is defined at the ratio of the aver-
age number of data bits accepted at the receiver in a given time to the
number of data bits that could have been accepted if ARQ had not been
used. Let PA be the probability that a block is accepted; then, as shown
in Taub and Schilling (1986), the throughputs are

Introduction
This chapter describes how the link-power budget calculations are
made. These calculations basically relate two quantities, the transmit
power and the receive power, and show in detail how the difference
between these two powers is accounted for.
Link budget calculations are usually made using decibel or decilog
quantities. These are explained in App. G. In this text brackets are
used to denote decibel quantities using the basic power definition.
Where no ambiguity arises regarding the units, the abbreviation dB is
used. For example, Boltzmann’s constant is given as 228.6 dB,
although, strictly speaking, this should be given as 228.6 decilogs
relative to one joule per kelvin. Where it is desirable to show the ref-
erence unit, this is indicated in the abbreviation, for example, dBHz
means decibels relative to one hertz.
12.2
Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power
A key parameter in link budget calculations is the equivalent isotrop-
ic radiated power, conventionally denoted as EIRP. From Eqs. (6.4)
and (6.5), the maximum power flux density at some distance r from a
transmitting antenna of gain G is
M 
(12.1)
An isotropic radiator with an input power equal to GPS would produce
the same flux density. Hence this product is referred to as the equiva-
lent isotropic radiated power, or

EIRP is often expressed in decibels relative to one watt, or dBW. Let
PS be in watts; then
[EIRP]  [PS]  [G]

(12.3)
where [PS] is also in dBW and [G] is in dB.
Example 12.1

power of 6 W and an antenna gain of 48.2 dB. Calculate the EIRP in dBW.
solution
[EIRP]  10 log 6  48.2
 56 dBW
For a paraboloidal antenna, the isotropic power gain is given by Eq.
(6.32). This equation may be rewritten in terms of frequency, since this
is the quantity which is usually known:
G   (10.472fD)2
(12.4)
where f is the carrier frequency in gigahertz, D is the reflector diame-
ter in meters, and  is the aperture efficiency. A typical value for aper-
ture efficiency is 0.55, although values as high as 0.73 have been
specified (Andrew Antenna, 1985).
With the diameter D in feet and all other quantities as before, the
equation for power gain becomes
G   (3.192fD)2
(12.5)
Example 12.2
Calculate the gain of a 3-m paraboloidal antenna operating
at a frequency of 12 GHz. Assume an aperture efficiency of 0.55.

Hence
[G]  10 log 78,168  48.9 dB
12.3
Transmission Losses
The [EIRP] may be thought of as the power input to one end of the
transmission link, and the problem is to find the power received at the
other end. Losses will occur along the way, some of which are constant.

Chapter Twelve
TLFeBOOK

Other losses can only be estimated from statistical data, and some of
these are dependent on weather conditions, especially on rainfall.
The first step in the calculations is to determine the losses for clear-
weather, or clear-sky, conditions. These calculations take into account
the losses, including those calculated on a statistical basis, which do
not vary significantly with time. Losses which are weather-related,
and other losses which fluctuate with time, are then allowed for by
introducing appropriate fade margins into the transmission equation.
12.3.1
Free-space transmission
As a first step in the loss calculations, the power loss resulting from the
spreading of the signal in space must be determined. This calculation is
similar for the uplink and the downlink of a satellite circuit. Using Eqs.
(12.1) and (12.2) gives the power flux density at the receiving antenna as
M 
(12.6)
The power delivered to a matched receiver is this power flux densi-
ty multiplied by the effective aperture of the receiving antenna, given
by Eq. (6.15). The received power is therefore
PR  MAeff

(12.7)
 (EIRP) (GR) 

Recall that r is the distance, or range, between the transmit and
receive antennas and GR is the isotropic power gain of the receiving
antenna. The subscript R is used to identify the receiving antenna.
The right-hand side of Eq. (12.7) is separated into three terms asso-
ciated with the transmitter, receiver, and free space, respectively. In
decibel notation, the equation becomes
[PR]  [EIRP]  [GR]  10 log 

(12.8)
The received power in dBW is therefore given as the sum of the
transmitted EIRP in dBW plus the receiver antenna gain in dB minus
a third term which represents the free-space loss in decibels. The free-
space loss component in decibels is given by

Normally, the frequency rather than wavelength will be known, and
the substitution   c/f can be made, where c  108 m/s. With fre-
quency in megahertz and distance in kilometers, it is left as an exer-
cise for the student to show that the free-space loss is given by
[FSL]  32.4  20 log r  20 log f
(12.10)
Equation (12.8) can then be written as
[PR]  [EIRP]  [GR]  [FSL]
(12.11)
The received power [PR] will be in dBW when the [EIRP] is in dBW
and [FSL] in dB. Equation (12.9) is applicable to both the uplink and
the downlink of a satellite circuit, as will be shown in more detail
shortly.
Example 12.3
The range between a ground station and a satellite is 42,000
km. Calculate the free-space loss at a frequency of 6 GHz.
solution
[FSL]  (32.4  20 log 42,000  20 log 6000)  200.4 dB
This is a very large loss. Suppose that the [EIRP] is 56 dBW (as cal-
culated in Example 12.1 for a radiated power of 6 W) and the receive
antenna gain is 50 dB. The receive power would be 56  50  200.4 
94.4 dBW. This is 355 pW. It also may be expressed as 64.4 dBm,
which is 64.4 dB below the 1-mW reference level.
Equation (12.11) shows that the received power is increased by
increasing antenna gain as expected, and Eq. (6.32) shows that anten-
na gain is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength.
Hence it might be thought that increasing the frequency of operation
(and therefore decreasing wavelength) would increase the received
power. However, Eq. (12.9) shows that the free-space loss is also
inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength, so these two
effects cancel. It follows, therefore, that for a constant EIRP, the
received power is independent of frequency of operation.
If the transmit power is a specified constant, rather than the EIRP,
then the received power will increase with increasing frequency for
given antenna dish sizes at the transmitter and receiver. It is left 
as an exercise for the student to show that under these conditions 
the received power is directly proportional to the square of the 
frequency.

12.3.2
Feeder losses
Losses will occur in the connection between the receive antenna and
the receiver proper. Such losses will occur in the connecting wave-
guides, filters, and couplers. These will be denoted by RFL, or [RFL]
dB, for receiver feeder losses. The [RFL] values are added to [FSL] in
Eq. (12.11). Similar losses will occur in the filters, couplers, and wave-
guides connecting the transmit antenna to the high-power amplifier
(HPA) output. However, provided that the EIRP is stated, Eq. (12.11)
can be used without knowing the transmitter feeder losses. These are
needed only when it is desired to relate EIRP to the HPA output, as
described in Secs. 12.7.4 and 12.8.2.
12.3.3
Antenna misalignment losses
When a satellite link is established, the ideal situation is to have the
earth station and satellite antennas aligned for maximum gain, as
shown in Fig. 12.1a. There are two possible sources of off-axis loss, one
at the satellite and one at the earth station, as shown in Fig. 12.1b.
The off-axis loss at the satellite is taken into account by designing the
link for operation on the actual satellite antenna contour; this is
described in more detail in later sections. The off-axis loss at the earth
station is referred to as the antenna pointing loss. Antenna pointing
losses are usually only a few tenths of a decibel; typical values are giv-
en in Table 12.1.

TLFeBOOK

In addition to pointing losses, losses may result at the antenna from
misalignment of the polarization direction (these are in addition to the
polarization losses described in Chap. 5). The polarization misalign-
ment losses are usually small, and it will be assumed that the anten-
na misalignment losses, denoted by [AML], include both pointing and
polarization losses resulting from antenna misalignment. It should be
noted that the antenna misalignment losses have to be estimated from
statistical data, based on the errors actually observed for a large num-
ber of earth stations, and of course, the separate antenna misalign-
ment losses for the uplink and the downlink must be taken into
account.
12.3.4
Fixed atmospheric and ionospheric
losses
Atmospheric gases result in losses by absorption, as described in Sec.
4.2 and by Eq. (4.1). These losses usually amount to a fraction of a
decibel, and in subsequent calculations, the decibel value will be
denoted by [AA]. Values obtained for some locations in the Province of
Ontario in Canada are shown in Table 12.1. Also, as discussed in Sec.
5.5, the ionosphere introduces a depolarization loss given by Eq. (5.19),
and in subsequent calculations, the decibel value for this will be denot-
ed by [PL].

The Link-Power Budget Equation
As mentioned at the beginning of Sec. 12.3, the [EIRP] can be consid-
ered as the input power to a transmission link. Now that the losses for
the link have been identified, the power at the receiver, which is the
power output of the link, may be calculated simply as [EIRP]  [LOSS-
ES]  [GR], where the last quantity is the receiver antenna gain. Note
carefully that decibel addition must be used.
The major source of loss in any ground-satellite link is the free-space
spreading loss [FSL], as shown in Sec. 12.3.1, where Eq. (12.13) is the
basic link-power budget equation taking into account this loss only.
However, the other losses also must be taken into account, and these
are simply added to [FSL]. The losses for clear-sky conditions are

be neglected. Calculate the total link loss for clear-sky conditions.

System Noise
It is shown in Sec. 12.3 that the receiver power in a satellite link is
very small, on the order of picowatts. This by itself would be no prob-
lem because amplification could be used to bring the signal strength
up to an acceptable level. However, electrical noise is always present

at the input, and unless the signal is significantly greater than the
noise, amplification will be of no help because it will amplify signal
and noise to the same extent. In fact, the situation will be worsened by
the noise added by the amplifier.
The major source of electrical noise in equipment is that which aris-
es from the random thermal motion of electrons in various resistive
and active devices in the receiver. Thermal noise is also generated in
the lossy components of antennas, and thermal-like noise is picked up
by the antennas as radiation.
The available noise power from a thermal noise source is given by
PN  kTNBN
(12.14)
Here, TN is known as the equivalent noise temperature, BN is the
equivalent noise bandwidth, and k  1.38  1023 J/K is Boltzmann’s
constant. With the temperature in kelvins and bandwidth in hertz, the
noise power will be in watts. The noise power bandwidth is always
wider than the 3-dB bandwidth determined from the amplitude-fre-
quency response curve, and a useful rule of thumb is that the noise
bandwidth is equal to 1.12 times the 3-dB bandwidth, or BN 
 1.12
 B3 dB.
The main characteristic of thermal noise is that it has a flat fre-
quency spectrum; that is, the noise power per unit bandwidth is a con-
stant. The noise power per unit bandwidth is termed the noise power
spectral density. Denoting this by N0, then from Eq. (12.14),
N0 
 kTN joules

The noise temperature is directly related to the physical tempera-
ture of the noise source but is not always equal to it. This is discussed
more fully in the following sections. The noise temperatures of various
sources which are connected together can be added directly to give the
total noise.
Example 12.5
An antenna has a noise temperature of 35 K and is matched
into a receiver which has a noise temperature of 100 K. Calculate (a) the
noise power density and (b) the noise power for a bandwidth of 36 MHz.

in signal products which appear as noise and in fact is referred to as
intermodulation noise. This is discussed in Sec. 12.10.
12.5.1
Antenna noise
Antennas operating in the receiving mode introduce noise into the
satellite circuit. Noise therefore will be introduced by the satellite
antenna and the ground station receive antenna. Although the physi-
cal origins of the noise in either case are similar, the magnitudes of the
effects differ significantly.
The antenna noise can be broadly classified into two groups: noise
originating from antenna losses and sky noise. Sky noise is a term used
to describe the microwave radiation which is present throughout the
universe and which appears to originate from matter in any form at
finite temperatures. Such radiation in fact covers a wider spectrum
than just the microwave spectrum. The equivalent noise temperature
of the sky, as seen by an earth station antenna, is shown in Fig. 12.2.
The lower graph is for the antenna pointing directly overhead, while
the upper graph is for the antenna pointing just above the horizon.
The increased noise in the latter case results from the thermal radia-
tion of the earth, and this in fact sets a lower limit of about 5° at C
band and 10° at Ku band on the elevation angle which may be used
with ground-based antennas.
The graphs show that at the low-frequency end of the spectrum, the
noise decreases with increasing frequency. Where the antenna is
zenith-pointing, the noise temperature falls to about 3 K at frequen-
cies between about 1 and 10 GHz. This represents the residual back-
ground radiation in the universe. Above about 10 GHz, two peaks in
temperature are observed, resulting from resonant losses in the
earth’s atmosphere. These are seen to coincide with the peaks in
atmospheric absorption loss shown in Fig. 4.2.
Any absorptive loss mechanism generates thermal noise, there
being a direct connection between the loss and the effective noise tem-
perature, as shown in Sec. 12.5.5. Rainfall introduces attenuation, and
therefore, it degrades transmissions in two ways: It attenuates the sig-
nal, and it introduces noise. The detrimental effects of rain are much
worse at Ku-band frequencies than at C-band, and the downlink rain-
fade margin discussed in Sec. 12.9.2 also must allow for the increased
noise which is generated.
Figure 12.2 applies to ground-based antennas. Satellite antennas
are generally pointed toward the earth, and therefore, they receive the
full thermal radiation from it. In this case the equivalent noise tem-
perature of the antenna, excluding antenna losses, is approximately
290 K.
The Space Link
313
TLFeBOOK

Antenna losses add to the noise received as radiation, and the total
antenna noise temperature is the sum of the equivalent noise temper-
atures of all these sources. For large ground-based C-band antennas,
the total antenna noise temperature is typically about 60 K, and for
the Ku band, about 80 K under clear-sky conditions. These values do
not apply to any specific situation and are quoted merely to give some
idea of the magnitudes involved. Figure 12.3 shows the noise temper-
ature as a function of angle of elevation for a 1.8-m antenna operating
in the Ku band.
12.5.2
Amplifier noise temperature
Consider first the noise representation of the antenna and the low-
noise amplifier (LNA) shown in Fig. 12.4a. The available power gain of
the amplifier is denoted as G, and the noise power output, as Pno. For
the moment we will work with the noise power per unit bandwidth,

antenna is assumed to have a very narrow beam without sidelobes or electrical
losses. Below 1 GHz, the maximum values are for the beam pointed at the galac-
tic poles. At higher frequencies, the maximum values are for the beam just above
the horizon and the minimum values for zenith pointing. The low-noise region
between 1 and 10 GHz is most amenable to application of special, low-noise anten-
nas. (From Philip F. Panter, “Communications Systems Design,” McGraw-Hill

which is simply noise energy in joules as shown by Eq. (12.15). The
input noise energy coming from the antenna is
No,ant  kTant
(12.16)
The output noise energy No,out will be GNo,ant plus the contribution
made by the amplifier. Now all the amplifier noise, wherever it occurs
in the amplifier, may be referred to the input in terms of an equivalent
input noise temperature for the amplifier Te. This allows the output
noise to be written as
No,out  Gk (Tant  Te)
(12.17)
The total noise referred to the input is simply No,out/G, or
No,in  k (Tant  Te)
(12.18)
Te can be obtained by measurement, a typical value being in the range
35 to 100 K. Typical values for Tant are given in Sec. 12.5.1.

The noise energy of amplifier 2 referred to its own input is simply
kTe2. The noise input to amplifier 2 from the preceding stages is
G1k(Tant  Te1), and thus the total noise energy referred to amplifier 2
input is

This is a very important result. It shows that the noise temperature
of the second stage is divided by the power gain of the first stage when
referred to the input. Therefore, in order to keep the overall system
noise as low as possible, the first stage (usually an LNA) should have
high power gain as well as low noise temperature.
This result may be generalized to any number of stages in cascade,

12.5.4
Noise factor
An alternative way of representing amplifier noise is by means of its
noise factor F. In defining the noise factor of an amplifier, the source is
taken to be at room temperature, denoted by T0, usually taken as 290
K. The input noise from such a source is kT0, and the output noise from
the amplifier is
N0,out  FGkT0
(12.25)
Here, G is the available power gain of the amplifier as before, and F is
its noise factor.
A simple relationship between noise temperature and noise factor
can be derived. Let Te be the noise temperature of the amplifier, and
let the source be at room temperature as required by the definition of
F. This means that Tant  T0. Since the same noise output must be
available whatever the representation, it follows that
Gk (T0  Te)  FGkT0
or
Te  (F  1) T0
(12.26)
This shows the direct equivalence between noise factor and noise
temperature. As a matter of convenience, in a practical satellite receiv-
ing system, noise temperature is specified for low-noise amplifiers and
converters, while noise factor is specified for the main receiver unit.
The noise figure is simply F expressed in decibels:
Noise figure  [F]  10 log F

Example 12.6

of 12 dB. The gain of the LNA is 40 dB, and its noise temperature is 120 K.
Calculate the overall noise temperature referred to the LNA input.

In Example 12.6 it will be seen that the decibel quantities must be
converted to power ratios. Also, even though the main receiver has a
very high noise temperature, its effect is made negligible by the high
gain of the LNA.
12.5.5
Noise temperature of absorptive
networks
An absorptive network is one which contains resistive elements. These
introduce losses by absorbing energy from the signal and converting it
to heat. Resistive attenuators, transmission lines, and waveguides are
all examples of absorptive networks, and even rainfall, which absorbs
energy from radio signals passing through it, can be considered a form
of absorptive network. Because an absorptive network contains resis-
tance it generates thermal noise.
Consider an absorptive network which has a power loss L. The pow-
er loss is simply the ratio of input power to output power and will
always be greater than unity. Let the network be matched at both
ends, to a terminating resistor RT at one end and an antenna at the
other, as shown in Fig. 12.5, and let the system be at some ambient
temperature Tx. The noise energy transferred from RT into the net-
work is kTx. Let the network noise be represented at the output ter-
minals (the terminals connected to the antenna in this instance) by an
equivalent noise temperature TNW,o. Then the noise energy radiated by
the antenna is
Nrad 
 kTNW,o
(12.28)
Because the antenna is matched to a resistive source at temperature
Tx, the available noise energy which is fed into the antenna and radi-
ated is Nrad  kTx. Keep in mind that the antenna resistance to which
the network is matched is fictitious in the sense that it represents
radiated power, but it does not generate noise power. This expression
for Nrad can be substituted into Eq. (12.28) to give

This is the equivalent noise temperature of the network referred to the
output terminals of the network. The equivalent noise at the output
can be transferred to the input on dividing by the network power gain,
which by definition is 1/L. Thus the equivalent noise temperature of
the network referred to the network input is
TNW,i  Tx (L  1)

Since the network is bilateral, Eqs. (12.29) and (12.30) apply for sig-
nal flow in either direction. Thus Eq. (12.30) gives the equivalent noise
temperature of a lossy network referred to the input at the antenna
when the antenna is used in receiving mode.
If the lossy network should happen to be at room temperature, that
is, Tx  T0, then a comparison of Eqs. (12.26) and (12.30) shows that
F  L
(12.31)
This shows that at room temperature the noise factor of a lossy net-
work is equal to its power loss.

the previous sections yields, for the system noise temperature referred

The significance of the individual terms is illustrated in the following
examples.
Example 12.7
For the system shown in Fig. 12.6a, the receiver noise fig-
ure is 12 dB, the cable loss is 5 dB, the LNA gain is 50 dB, and its noise tem-
perature 150 K. The antenna noise temperature is 35 K. Calculate the noise

In this case the cable precedes the LNA, and therefore, the equiva-
lent noise temperature referred to the cable input is

Examples 12.7 and 12.8 illustrate the important point that the LNA
must be placed ahead of the cable, which is why one sees amplifiers
mounted right at the dish in satellite receive systems.
12.6
Carrier-to-Noise Ratio
A measure of the performance of a satellite link is the ratio of carrier
power to noise power at the receiver input, and link budget calcula-
tions are often concerned with determining this ratio. Conventionally,
the ratio is denoted by C/N (or CNR), which is equivalent to PR/PN. In
terms of decibels,

The G/T ratio is a key parameter in specifying the receiving system
performance. The antenna gain GR and the system noise temperature
TS can be combined in Eq. (12.34) as
[G/T]  [GR]  [TS]

Therefore, the link equation [Eq. (12.34)] becomes

[C/N] is a true power ratio in units of decibels, and [BN] is in decibels
relative to one hertz, or dBHz. Thus the units for [C/No] are dBHz.

Example 12.9
In a link budget calculation at 12 GHz, the free-space loss is
206 dB, the antenna pointing loss is 1 dB, and the atmospheric absorption is
2 dB. The receiver G/T ratio is 19.5 dB/K, and receiver feeder losses are 1 dB.
The EIRP is 48 dBW. Calculate the carrier-to-noise spectral density ratio.
solution
The data are best presented in tabular form and in fact lend them-
selves readily to spreadsheet-type computations. For brevity, the units are
shown as decilogs, and losses are entered as negative numbers to take
account of the minus sign in Eq. (12.38). Recall that Boltzmann’s constant
equates to 228.6 decilogs, so [k]  228.6 decilogs, as shown in the table.
Entering data in this way allows the final result to be entered in a table cell
as the sum of the terms in the rows above the cell, a feature usually incor-
porated in spreadsheets and word processors. This is illustrated in the fol-
lowing table.

12.7
The Uplink
The uplink of a satellite circuit is the one in which the earth station is
transmitting the signal and the satellite is receiving it. Equation
(12.38) can be applied to the uplink, but subscript U will be used to
denote specifically that the uplink is being considered. Thus Eq.
(12.38) becomes

	
U
 [EIRP]U   	 U
 [LOSSES] U  [k]
(12.39)
In Eq. (12.39) the values to be used are the earth station EIRP, the
satellite receiver feeder losses, and satellite receiver G/T. The free-
space loss and other losses which are frequency-dependent are cal-
culated for the uplink frequency. The resulting carrier-to-noise
density ratio given by Eq. (12.39) is that which appears at the satel-
lite receiver.
In some situations, the flux density appearing at the satellite receive
antenna is specified rather than the earth station EIRP, and Eq.
(12.39) is modified as explained next.
12.7.1
Saturation flux density
As explained in Sec. 7.7.3, the traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA)
in a satellite transponder exhibits power output saturation, as shown
in Fig. 7.21. The flux density required at the receiving antenna to pro-
duce saturation of the TWTA is termed the saturation flux density. The
saturation flux density is a specified quantity in link budget calcula-
tions, and knowing it, one can calculate the required EIRP at the earth
station. To show this, consider again Eq. (12.6) which gives the flux
density in terms of EIRP, repeated here for convenience:

it is the effective area of an isotropic antenna. Denoting this by A0
gives
[A 0]  10 log 
(12.43)
Since frequency rather than wavelength is normally known, it is left
as an exercise for the student to show that with frequency f in giga-
hertz, Eq. (12.43) can be rewritten as
[A0]   (21.45  20 log f)
(12.44)
Combining this with Eq. (12.42) and rearranging slightly gives the
EIRP as
[EIRP]  [M]  [A0]  [FSL]
(12.45)
Equation (12.45) was derived on the basis that the only loss present
was the spreading loss, denoted by [FSL]. But, as shown in the previ-
ous sections, the other propagation losses are the atmospheric absorp-
tion loss, the polarization mismatch loss, and the antenna
misalignment loss. When allowance is made for these, Eq. (12.45)
becomes
[EIRP]  [M]  [A0]  [FSL]  [AA]  [PL]  [AML] (12.46)
In terms of the total losses given by Eq. (12.12), Eq. (12.46) becomes

This is for clear-sky conditions and gives the minimum value of
[EIRP] which the earth station must provide to produce a given flux
density at the satellite. Normally, the saturation flux density will be
specified. With saturation values denoted by the subscript S, Eq.
(12.47) is rewritten as
[EIRPS]U  [S]  [A0]  [LOSSES]U  [RFL]
(12.48)
Example 12.10
An uplink operates at 14 GHz, and the flux density
required to saturate the transponder is 120 dB(W/m2). The free-space loss
is 207 dB, and the other propagation losses amount to 2 dB. Calculate the
earth-station [EIRP] required for saturation, assuming clear-sky conditions.
Assume [RFL] is negligible.
solution
At 14 GHz,
[A0]   (21.45  20 log 14)  44.37 dB
The losses in the propagation path amount to 207  2  209 dB. Hence,
from Eq. (12.48),
[EIRPS]U  120  44.37  209
 44.63 dBW
12.7.2
Input backoff
As described in Sec. 12.7.3, where a number of carriers are present
simultaneously in a TWTA, the operating point must be backed off to
a linear portion of the transfer characteristic to reduce the effects of
intermodulation distortion. Such multiple carrier operation occurs
with frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and is described in
Chap. 14. The point to be made here is that backoff must be allowed
for in the link budget calculations.
Suppose that the saturation flux density for single-carrier operation
is known. Input backoff will be specified for multiple-carrier operation,
referred to the single-carrier saturation level. The earth station EIRP
will have to be reduced by the specified backoff (BO), resulting in an
uplink value of
[EIRP]U  [EIRPS]U  [BO]i
(12.49)
Although some control of the input to the transponder power ampli-
fier is possible through the ground TT&C station, as described in Sec.
12.7.3, input backoff is normally achieved through reduction of the
[EIRP] of the earth stations actually accessing the transponder.

and receiver feeder losses amount to 0.6 dB. Calculate the carrier-to-noise

solution
As in Example 12.9, the calculations are the best carried out in tab-
ular form. [A0]  44.37 dBm2 for a frequency of 14 GHz is calculated by
using Eq. (12.44) as in Example 12.10.

[RFL] and [BO]i are entered as negative numbers to take account of the
minus signs attached to them in Eq. (12.50). The total gives the carrier-to-
noise density ratio at the satellite receiver as 74.5 dBHz.
Since fade margins have not been included at this stage, Eq. (12.50)
applies for clear-sky conditions. Usually, the most serious fading is
caused by rainfall, as described in Sec. 12.9.
12.7.3
The earth station HPA
The earth station high-power amplifier has to supply the radiated
power plus the transmit feeder losses, denoted here by TFL, or [TFL]
dB. These include waveguide, filter, and coupler losses between the
HPA output and the transmit antenna. Referring back to Eq. (12.3),
the power output of the HPA is given by
[PHPA]  [EIRP]  [GT]  [TFL]
(12.51)
The [EIRP] is that given by Eq. (12.49) and thus includes any input
backoff that is required at the satellite.
The earth station itself may have to transmit multiple carriers, and
its output also will require back off, denoted by [BO]HPA. The earth sta-
tion HPA must be rated for a saturation power output given by

[PHPA,sat]  [PHPA]  [BO]HPA
(12.52)
Of course, the HPA will be operated at the backed-off power level so
that it provides the required power output [PHPA]. To ensure operation
well into the linear region, an HPA with a comparatively high satura-
tion level can be used and a high degree of backoff introduced. The
large physical size and high power consumption associated with larg-
er tubes do not carry the same penalties they would if used aboard the
satellite. Again, it is emphasized that backoff at the earth station may
be required quite independently of any backoff requirements at the
satellite transponder. The power rating of the earth station HPA also
should be sufficient to provide a fade margin, as discussed in Sec.
12.9.1.
12.8
Downlink
The downlink of a satellite circuit is the one in which the satellite is
transmitting the signal and the earth station is receiving it. Equation
(12.38) can be applied to the downlink, but subscript D will be used to
denote specifically that the downlink is being considered. Thus Eq.
(12.38) becomes

	D
 [EIRP]D   	D
 [LOSSES]D  [k]
(12.53)
In Eq. (12.53) the values to be used are the satellite EIRP, the earth
station receiver feeder losses, and the earth station receiver G/T. The
free-space and other losses are calculated for the downlink frequency.
The resulting carrier-to-noise density ratio given by Eq. (12.53) is that
which appears at the detector of the earth station receiver.
Where the carrier-to-noise ratio is the specified quantity rather than
carrier-to-noise density ratio, Eq. (12.38) is used. This becomes, on
assuming that the signal bandwidth B is equal to the noise bandwidth

width of 36 MHz, and it must provide a C/N ratio at the destination earth
station of 22 dB. Given that the total transmission losses are 200 dB and the
destination earth station G/T ratio is 31 dB/K, calculate the satellite EIRP
required.

Output back-off
Where input back-off is employed as described in Sec. 12.7.2, a corre-
sponding output back-off must be allowed for in the satellite EIRP. As
the curve of Fig. 7.21 shows, output back-off is not linearly related to
input backoff. A rule of thumb frequently used is to take the output
backoff as the point on the curve which is 5 dB below the extrapolated
linear portion, as shown in Fig. 12.7. Since the linear portion gives a
1:1 change in decibels, the relationship between input and output
backoff is [BO]o  [BO]i  5 dB. For example, with an input back-off
of [BO]i  11 dB, the corresponding output back-off is [BO]o  11  5

For the uplink, the saturation flux density at the satellite receiver is

saturation flux density at the earth station receiver, since this is a ter-
minal point, and the signal is not used to saturate a power amplifier.
12.8.2
Satellite TWTA output
The satellite power amplifier, which usually is a traveling-wave tube
amplifier, has to supply the radiated power plus the transmit feeder
losses. These losses include the waveguide, filter, and coupler losses
between the TWTA output and the satellite’s transmit antenna.
Referring back to Eq. (12.3), the power output of the TWTA is given by

Effects of Rain
Up to this point, calculations have been made for clear-sky conditions,
meaning the absence of weather-related phenomena which might
affect the signal strength. In the C band and, more especially, the Ku
band, rainfall is the most significant cause of signal fading. Rainfall
results in attenuation of radio waves by scattering and by absorption
of energy from the wave, as described in Sec. 4.4. Rain attenuation
increases with increasing frequency and is worse in the Ku band com-
pared with the C band. Studies have shown (CCIR Report 338-3, 1978)
that the rain attenuation for horizontal polarization is considerably
greater than for vertical polarization.
Rain attenuation data are usually available in the form of curves or
tables showing the fraction of time that a given attenuation is exceed-
ed or, equivalently, the probability that a given attenuation will be
exceeded (see Hogg et al., 1975; Lin et al., 1980; Webber et al., 1986).
Some yearly average Ku-band values are shown in Table 12.2.
The percentage figures at the head of the first three columns give
the percentage of time, averaged over any year, that the attenuation

exceeds the dB values given in each column. For example, at Thunder
Bay, the rain attenuation exceeds, on average throughout the year, 0.2
dB for 1 percent of the time, 0.3 dB for 0.5 percent of the time, and 1.3
dB for 0.1 percent of the time. Alternatively, one could say that for 99
percent of the time, the attenuation will be equal to or less than 0.2
dB; for 99.5 percent of the time, it will be equal to or less than 0.3 dB;
and for 99.9 percent of the time, it will be equal to or less than 1.3 dB.
Rain attenuation is accompanied by noise generation, and both the
attenuation and the noise adversely affect satellite circuit perfor-
mance, as described in Secs. 12.9.1 and 12.9.2.
As a result of falling through the atmosphere, raindrops are some-
what flattened in shape, becoming elliptical rather than spherical.
When a radio wave with some arbitrary polarization passes through
raindrops, the component of electric field in the direction of the major
axes of the raindrops will be affected differently from the component
along the minor axes. This produces a depolarization of the wave; in
effect, the wave becomes elliptically polarized (see Sec. 5.6). This is
true for both linear and circular polarizations, and the effect seems to
be much worse for circular polarization (Freeman, 1981). Where only
a single polarization is involved, the effect is not serious, but where
frequency reuse is achieved through the use of orthogonal polarization
(as described in Chap. 5), depolarizing devices, which compensate for
the rain depolarization, may have to be installed.
Where the earth station antenna is operated under cover of a
radome, the effect of the rain on the radome must be taken into
account. Rain falling on a hemispherical radome forms a water layer
of constant thickness. Such a layer introduces losses both by absorp-
tion and by reflection. Results presented by Hogg and Chu (1975) show
an attenuation of about 14 dB for a 1-mm-thick water layer. It is desir-
able therefore that earth station antennas be operated without
radomes where possible. Without a radome, water will gather on the
antenna reflector, but the attenuation produced by this is much less
serious than that produced by the wet radome (Hogg and Chu, 1975).
12.9.1
Uplink rain-fade margin
Rainfall results in attenuation of the signal and an increase in noise
temperature, degrading the [C/No] at the satellite in two ways. The
increase in noise, however, is not usually a major factor for the uplink.
This is so because the satellite antenna is pointed toward a “hot”
earth, and this added to the satellite receiver noise temperature tends
to mask any additional noise induced by rain attenuation. What is
important is that the uplink carrier power at the satellite must be held
within close limits for certain modes of operation, and some form of
uplink power control is necessary to compensate for rain fades. The

power output from the satellite may be monitored by a central control
station or in some cases by each earth station, and the power output
from any given earth station may be increased if required to compen-
sate for fading. Thus the earth-station HPA must have sufficient
reserve power to meet the fade margin requirement.
Some typical rain-fade margins are shown in Table 12.2. As an
example, for Ottawa, the rain attenuation exceeds 1.9 dB for 0.1 per-
cent of the time. This means that to meet the specified power require-
ments at the input to the satellite for 99.9 percent of the time, the
earth station must be capable of providing a 1.9-dB margin over the
clear-sky conditions.
12.9.2
Downlink rain-fade margin
The results given by Eqs. (12.53) and (12.54) are for clear-sky condi-
tions. Rainfall introduces attenuation by absorption and scattering of
signal energy, and the absorptive attenuation introduces noise as dis-
cussed in Sec. 12.5.5. Let [A] dB represent the rain attenuation caused
by absorption. The corresponding power loss ratio is A  10[A]/10, and
substituting this for L in Eq. (12.29) gives the effective noise tempera-
ture of the rain as
Train  Ta 1  
(12.58)
Here, Ta, which takes the place of Tx in Eq. (12.29), is known as the
apparent absorber temperature. It is a measured parameter which is a
function of many factors including the physical temperature of the
rain and the scattering effect of the rain cell on the thermal noise inci-
dent upon it (Hogg and Chu, 1975). The value of the apparent absorber
temperature lies between 270 and 290 K, with measured values for
North America lying close to or just below freezing (273 K). For exam-
ple, the measured value given by Webber et al. (1986) is 272 K.
The total sky-noise temperature is the clear-sky temperature TCS
plus the rain temperature:
Tsky  TCS  Train
(12.59)
Rainfall therefore degrades the received [C/No] in two ways: by atten-
uating the carrier wave and by increasing the sky-noise temperature.
Example 12.16
Under clear-sky conditions, the downlink [C/N] is 20 dB,
the effective noise temperature of the receiving system being 400 K. If rain
attenuation exceeds 1.9 dB for 0.1 percent of the time, calculate the value
below which [C/N] falls for 0.1 percent of the time. Assume Ta  280 K.

solution
1.9 dB attenuation is equivalent to a 1.55:1 power loss. The equiv-
alent noise temperature of the rain is therefore
Train  280 (1  1/1.55)  99.2 K
The new system noise temperature is 400  99.2  499.2 K. The decibel
increase in noise power is therefore [499.2]  [400]  0.96 dB. At the same
time, the carrier is reduced by 1.9 dB, and therefore, the [C/N] with 1.9-dB
rain attenuation drops to 20  1.9  0.96  17.14 dB. This is the value
below which [C/N] drops for 0.1 percent of the time.
It is left as an exercise for the student to show that where the rain
power attenuation A (not dB) is entirely absorptive, the downlink C/N
power ratios (not dBs) are related to the clear-sky value by
 rain  CSA  (A  1)

(12.60)
where the subscript CS is used to indicate clear-sky conditions and
TS,CS is the system noise temperature under clear-sky conditions.
For low frequencies (6/4 GHz) and low rainfall rates (below about 1
mm/h), the rain attenuation is almost entirely absorptive. At higher
rainfall rates, scattering becomes significant, especially at the higher
frequencies. When scattering and absorption are both significant, the
total attenuation must be used to calculate the reduction in carrier
power and the absorptive attenuation to calculate the increase in noise
temperature.
As discussed in Chap. 9, a minimum value of [C/N] is required for
satisfactory reception. In the case of frequency modulation, the mini-
mum value is set by the threshold level of the FM detector, and a
threshold margin is normally allowed, as shown in Fig. 9.12. Sufficient
margin must be allowed so that rain-induced fades do not take the
[C/N] below threshold more than a specified percentage of the time, as
shown in Example 12.17.
Example 12.17
In an FM satellite system, the clear-sky downlink [C/N]
ratio is 17.4 dB and the FM detector threshold is 10 dB, as shown in Fig.
9.12. (a) Calculate the threshold margin at the FM detector, assuming the
threshold [C/N] is determined solely by the downlink value. (b) Given that
Ta  272 K and that TS,CS  544 K, calculate the percentage of time the sys-
tem stays above threshold. The curve of Fig. 12.8 may be used for the down-
link, and it may be assumed that the rain attenuation is entirely absorptive.
solution
(a) Since it is assumed that the overall [C/N] ratio is equal to the
downlink value, the clear-sky input [C/N] to the FM detector is 17.4 dB. The
threshold level for the detector is 10 dB, and therefore, the rain-fade mar-
gin is 17.4  10  7.4 dB.

(b) The rain attenuation can reduce the [C/N] to the threshold level of 10
dB (i.e., it reduces the margin to zero), which is a (C/N) power ratio of 10:1
or a downlink N/C power ratio of 1/10.
For clear-sky conditions, [C/N]CS  17.4 dB, which gives an N/C ratio of
0.0182. Substituting these values in Eq. (12.60) gives

Solving this equation for A gives A  4, or approximately 6 dB. From the

and therefore, the availability is 1  2.5  104  0.99975, or 99.975 per-
cent.
For digital signals, the required [C/N0] ratio is determined by the
acceptable bit error rate (BER), which must not be exceeded for more
than a specified percentage of the time. Figure 10.17 relates the BER
to the [Eb/No] ratio, and this in turn is related to the [C/No] by Eq.
(10.24), as discussed in Sec. 10.6.4.

For the downlink, the user does not have control of the satellite
[EIRP], and thus the downlink equivalent of uplink power control,
described in Sec. 12.9.1, cannot be used. In order to provide the rain-
fade margin needed, the gain of the receiving antenna may be
increased by using a larger dish and/or a receiver front end having a
lower noise temperature. Both measures increase the receiver [G/T]
ratio and thus increase [C/No] as shown by Eq. (12.53).
12.10
Combined Uplink and Downlink C/N
Ratio
The complete satellite circuit consists of an uplink and a downlink, as
sketched in Fig. 12.9a. Noise will be introduced on the uplink at the
satellite receiver input. Denoting the noise power per unit bandwidth
by PNU and the average carrier at the same point by PRU, the carrier-
to-noise ratio on the uplink is (C/No)U  (PRU/PNU). It is important to
note that power levels, and not decibels, are being used here.
The carrier power at the end of the space link is shown as PR, which
of course is also the received carrier power for the downlink. This is
equal to # times the carrier power input at the satellite, where # is the
system power gain from satellite input to earth station input, as

shown in Fig. 12.9a. It includes the satellite transponder and transmit
antenna gains, the downlink losses, and the earth station receive
antenna gain and feeder losses.
The noise at the satellite input also appears at the earth station
input multiplied by #, and in addition, the earth station introduces
its own noise, denoted by PND. Thus the end-of-link noise is #PNU 
PND.
The C/No ratio for the downlink alone, not counting the #PNU contri-
bution, is PR/PND, and the combined C/No ratio at the ground receiver is
PR/(#PNU  PND). The power flow diagram is shown in Fig. 12.9b. The
combined carrier-to-noise ratio can be determined in terms of the indi-
vidual link values. To show this, it is more convenient to work with the
noise-to-carrier ratios rather than the carrier-to-noise ratios, and
again, these must be expressed as power ratios, not decibels. Denoting
the combined noise-to-carrier ratio value by No/C, the uplink value by
(No/C)U, and the downlink value by (No/C)D then,

Equation (12.61) shows that to obtain the combined value of C/No, the
reciprocals of the individual values must be added to obtain the No/C
ratio and then the reciprocal of this taken to get C/No. Looked at in
another way, the reason for this reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals
method is that a single signal power is being transferred through the
system, while the various noise powers which are present are additive.
Similar reasoning applies to the carrier-to-noise ratio, C/N.
Example 12.18
For a satellite circuit the individual link carrier-to-noise
spectral density ratios are: uplink 100 dBHz; downlink 87 dBHz. Calculate

Example 12.18 illustrates the point that when one of the link C/No
ratios is much less than the other, the combined C/N ratio is approxi-
mately equal to the lower (worst) one. The downlink C/N is usually
(but not always) less than the uplink C/N, and in many cases it is
much less. This is true primarily because of the limited EIRP available
from the satellite.
Example 12.19 illustrates how backoff is taken into account in the
link budget calculations and how it affects the C/No ratio.
Example 12.19
A multiple carrier satellite circuit operates in the 6/4-GHz
band with the following characteristics. Uplink: Saturation flux density

may be ignored. Calculate the carrier-to-noise density ratios for both links
and the combined value.

Again, it is seen from Example 12.19 that the combined C/No value
is close to the lowest value, which is the downlink value.
So far, only thermal and antenna noise has been taken into account
in calculating the combined value of C/N ratio. Another source of noise
which must be considered is intermodulation noise, discussed in the
next section.
12.11
Intermodulation Noise
Intermodulation occurs where multiple carriers pass through any device
with nonlinear characteristics. In satellite communications systems,
this most commonly occurs in the traveling-wave tube high-power
amplifier aboard the satellite, as described in Sec. 7.7.3. Both amplitude
and phase nonlinearities give rise to intermodulation products.
As shown in Fig. 7.20, third-order intermodulation products fall on
neighboring carrier frequencies, where they result in interference.
Where a large number of modulated carriers are present, the inter-
modulation products are not distinguishable separately but instead
appear as a type of noise which is termed intermodulation noise.
The carrier-to-intermodulation-noise ratio is usually found experi-
mentally, or in some cases it may be determined by computer 
methods. Once this ratio is known, it can be combined with the 
carrier-to-thermal-noise ratio by the addition of the reciprocals in the
manner described in Sec. 12.10. Denoting the intermodulation term
by (C/N)IM and bearing in mind that the reciprocals of the C/N power
ratios (and not the corresponding dB values) must be added, Eq.
(12.61) is extended to

In order to reduce intermodulation noise, the TWT must be operat-
ed in a backoff condition as described previously. Figure 12.10 shows
how the [C/No]IM ratio improves as the input backoff is increased for a
typical TWT. At the same time, increasing the backoff decreases both
[C/No]U and [C/No]D, as shown by Eqs. (12.50) and (12.55). The result is
that there is an optimal point where the overall carrier-to-noise ratio
is a maximum. The component [C/N] ratios as functions of the TWT
input are sketched in Fig. 12.11. The TWT input in dB is []S  [BO]i,
and therefore, Eq. (12.50) plots as a straight line. Equation (12.55)
reflects the curvature in the TWT characteristic through the output
backoff, [BO]o, which is not linearly related to the input backoff, as
shown in Fig. 12.7. The intermodulation curve is not easily pre-
dictable, and only the general trend is shown. The overall [C/No],
which is calculated from Eq. (12.62), is also sketched. The optimal
operating point is defined by the peak of this curve.

system performance is determined by the ratio of wanted to interfer-
ing powers, in this case the wanted carrier to the interfering carrier
power or C/I ratio. The single most important factor controlling inter-
ference is the radiation pattern of the earth station antenna.
Comparatively large-diameter reflectors can be used with earth sta-
tion antennas, and hence narrow beamwidths can be achieved. For
example, a 10-m antenna at 14 GHz has a 3-dB beamwidth of about
0.15°. This is very much narrower than the 2° to 4° orbital spacing
allocated to satellites. To relate the C/I ratio to the antenna radiation
pattern, it is necessary first to define the geometry involved.
Figure 13.2 shows the angles subtended by two satellites in geosta-
tionary orbit. The orbital separation is defined as the angle  subtend-
ed at the center of the earth, known as the geocentric angle. However,
from an earth station at point P the satellites would appear to subtend
an angle ß. Angle ß is referred to as the topocentric angle. In all practi-
cal situations relating to satellite interference, the topocentric and geo-
centric angles may be assumed equal, and in fact, making this
assumption leads to an overestimate of the interference (Sharp, 1983).
Consider now S1 as the wanted satellite and S2 as the interfering
satellite. An antenna at P will have its main beam directed at S1 and
an off-axis component at angle  directed at S2. Angle  is the same as
the topocentric angle, which as already shown may be assumed equal
to the geocentric or orbital spacing angle. Therefore, when calculating
the antenna sidelobe pattern, the orbital spacing angle may be used,
as described in Sec. 13.2.4. Orbital spacing angles range from 2° to 4°
in 0.5° intervals in the C band.
In Fig. 13.3 the satellite circuit being interfered with is that from
earth station A via satellite S1 to receiving station B. The B1 mode of
interference can occur from satellite S2 into earth station B, and the B2

mode of interference can occur from earth station C into satellite S1. The
total single-entry interference is the combined effect of these two modes.
Because the satellites cannot carry very large antenna reflectors, the
beamwidth is relatively wide, even for the so-called spot beams. For
example, a 3.5-m antenna at 12 GHz has a beamwidth of about 0.5°, and
the equatorial arc subtended by this angle is about 314 km. In interfer-
ence calculations, therefore, the earth stations will be assumed to be sit-
uated on the 3-dB contours of the satellite footprints, in which case the
satellite antennas do not provide any gain discrimination between the
wanted and the interfering carriers on either transmit or receive.
13.2.1
Downlink
Equation (12.13) may be used to calculate the wanted and interfering
downlink carrier powers received by an earth station. The carrier pow-
er [C] in dBW received at station B is
[C]  [EIRP]13  [GB]  [FSL]
(13.1)
Here, [EIRP]1 is the equivalent isotropic radiated power in dBW from
satellite 1, the 3 dB accounts for the 3-dB contour of the satellite
transmit antenna, GB is the boresight (on-axis) receiving antenna gain
at B, and [FSL] is the free-space loss in decibels. A similar equation
may be used for the interfering carrier [I], except an additional term
[Y]D dB, allowing for polarization discrimination, must be included.
Also, the receiving antenna gain at B is determined by the off-axis
angle , giving

The subscript D is used to denote downlink, and "[E] is the difference
in dB between the [EIRP]s of the two satellites.
Example 13.1
The desired carrier [EIRP] from a satellite is 34 dBW, and
the ground station receiving antenna gain is 44 dB in the desired direc-
tion and 24.47 dB toward the interfering satellite. The interfering satel-
lite also radiates an [EIRP] of 34 dBW. The polarization discrimination is
4 dB. Determine the carrier-to-interference ratio at the ground receiving
antenna.

Uplink
A result similar to Eq. (13.3) can be derived for the uplink. In this sit-
uation, however, it is desirable to work with the radiated powers and
the antenna transmit gains rather than the EIRPs of the two earth
stations. Equation (12.3) may be used to substitute power and gain for
EIRP. Also, for the uplink, GB and GB() are replaced by the satellite
receive antenna gains, both of which are assumed to be given by the
3-dB contour. Denoting by "[P] the difference in dB between wanted
and interfering transmit powers, [GA] the boresight transmit antenna
gain at A, and [GC()] the off-axis transmit gain at C, it is left as an
exercise for the reader to show that Eq. (13.3) is modified to

Interference may be considered as a form of noise, and assuming that
the interference sources are statistically independent, the interference
powers may be added directly to give the total interference at receiver

same manner described in Sec. 12.10 for noise, resulting in

the two. For interference calculations, the fine detail of the antenna
pattern is not required, and an envelope curve is used instead.
Figure 13.4 shows a sketch of the envelope pattern used by the FCC.
The width of the mainlobe and transition region depend on the ratio of
the antenna diameter to the operating wavelength, and Fig. 13.4 is
intended to show only the general shape. The sidelope gain function in
decibels is defined for different ranges of . Specifying  in degrees, the
sidelobe gain function can be written as follows:

For the range of satellite orbital spacings presently in use, it is this
sidelobe gain function that determines the interference levels.

solution
The decibel increase in interference will be

The [C/I]D will be degraded directly by this amount. Alternatively, from Fig.
13.4,
[G (2°) ]  [G (4°) ]  21.4  13.9  7.5 dB
It should be noted that no simple relationship can be given for cal-
culating the effect of reduced orbital spacing on the overall [C/I]. The
separate uplink and downlink values must be calculated and combined
as described in Sec. 13.2.3. Other telecommunications authorities
specify antenna characteristics that differ from the FCC specifications
(see, e.g., CCIR Rep. 391–3, 1978).
13.2.5
Passband interference
In the preceding section, the carrier-to-interference ratio at the receiv-
er input is determined. However, the amount of interference reaching
the detector will depend on the amount of frequency overlap between
the interfering spectrum and the wanted channel passband.
Two situations can arise, as shown in Fig. 13.5. In Fig. 13.5a, partial
overlap of the interfering signal spectra with the wanted passband is
shown. The fractional interference is given as the ratio of the shaded
area to the total area under the interference spectrum curve. This is
denoted by Q (Sharp, 1983) or in decibels as [Q]. Where partial over-
lap occurs, Q is less than unity or [Q]  0 dB. Where the interfering
spectrum coincides with the wanted passband, [Q]  0 dB. Evaluation
of Q usually has to be carried out by computer.
Interference

sity curves for (a) wideband
interfering signal and (b) multi-
ple interfering carriers.
TLFeBOOK

The second situation, illustrated in Fig. 13.5b, is where multiple
interfering carriers are present within the wanted passband, such as
with single carrier per channel (SCPC) operation discussed in Sec.
14.5. Here, Q represents the sum of the interfering carrier powers
within the passband, and [Q]  0 dB.
In the FCC report FCC/OST R83–2 (Sharp, 1983), Q values are com-
puted for a wide range of interfering and wanted carrier combinations.
Typical [Q] values obtained from the FCC report are as follows: with
the wanted carrier a TV/FM signal and the interfering carrier a simi-
lar TV/FM signal, [Q]  0 dB; with SCPC/PSK interfering carriers, [Q]
 27.92 dB; and with the interfering carrier a wideband digital-type
signal, [Q]  3.36 dB.
The passband [C/I] ratio is calculated using
 	pb   	ant  [Q]
(13.7)
The positions of these ratios in the receiver chain are illustrated in
Fig. 13.6, where it will be seen that both [C/I]ant and [C/I]pb are prede-
tection ratios, measured at rf or IF. Interference also can be measured
in terms of the postdetector output, shown as [S/I] in Fig. 13.6, and
this is discussed in the next section.
13.2.6
Receiver transfer characteristic
In some situations a measure of the interference in the postdetection
baseband, rather than in the IF or rf passband, is required. Baseband
interference is measured in terms of baseband signal-to-interference
ratio [S/I]. To relate [S/I] to [C/I]ant, a receiver transfer characteristic is
introduced which takes into account the modulation characteristics of
the wanted and interfering signals and the carrier frequency separa-
tion. Denoting the receiver transfer characteristic in decibels by
[RTC], the relationship can be written as
 	   	ant  [RTC]
(13.8)
It will be seen that [RTC] is analogous to the receiver processing gain
[GP] introduced in Sec. 9.6.3. Note that it is the [C/I] at the antenna

which is used, not the passband value, the [RTC] taking into account
any frequency offset. The [RTC] will always be a positive number of
decibels so that the baseband signal-to-interference ratio will be
greater than the carrier-to-interference ratio at the antenna.
Calculation of [RTC] for various combinations of wanted and
interfering carriers is very complicated and has to be done by com-
puter. As an example, taken from Sharp (1983), when the wanted
carrier is TV/FM with a modulation index of 2.571 and the interfer-
ing carrier is TV/FM with a modulating index of 2.560, the carrier
frequency separation being zero, the [RTC] is computed to be 31.70
dB. These computations are limited to low levels of interference (see
Sec. 13.2.8).
13.2.7
Specified interference objectives
Although [C/I]pb or [S/I] gives a measure of interference, ultimately,
the effects of interference must be assessed in terms of what is tolera-
ble to the end user. Such assessment usually relies on some form of
subjective measurement. For TV, viewing tests are conducted in which
a mixed audience of experienced and inexperienced viewers (experi-
enced from the point of view of assessing the effects of interference)
assess the effects of interference on picture quality. By gradually
increasing the interference level, a quality impairment factor can be
established which ranges from 1 to 5. The five grades are defined as
(Chouinard, 1984)
5. Imperceptible
4. Perceptible, but not annoying
3. Slightly annoying
2. Annoying
1. Very annoying
Acceptable picture quality requires a quality impairment factor of at
least 4.2. Typical values of interference levels which result in accept-
able picture quality are for broadcast TV, [S/I]  67 dB; and for cable
TV, [C/I]pb  20 dB.
For digital circuits, the [C/I]pb is related to the bit error rate (BER)
(see, e.g., CCIR Rec. 523, 1978). Values of the required [C/I]pb used by
Sharp (1983) for different types of digital circuits range from 20 to
32.2 dB.
To give some idea of the numerical values involved, a summary of
the objectives stated in the FCC single-entry interference program is
presented in Table 13.1. In some cases the objective used differed from

the reference objective, and the values used are shown in parentheses.
In some entries in the table, noise is shown measured in units of
pW0p. Here, the pW stands for picowatts. The 0 means that the noise
is measured at a “zero-level test point,” which is a point in the circuit
where a test-tone signal produces a level of 0 dBm. The final p stands
for psophometrically weighted noise, discussed in Sec. 9.6.6.
13.2.8
Protection ratio
In CCIR Report 634–2 (1982), the International Radio Consultative
Committee (CCIR) specifies the permissible interference level for TV
carriers in terms of a parameter known as the protection ratio. The
protection ratio is defined as the minimum carrier-to-interference
ratio at the input to the receiver which results in “just perceptible”
degradation of picture quality. The protection ratio applies only for
wanted and interfering TV carriers at the same frequency, and it is
equivalent to [C/I]pb evaluated for this situation. Denoting the quality
impairment factor by QIF and the protection ratio in decibels by [PR0],
the equation given in CCIR (1982) is

13.3
Energy Dispersal
The power in a frequency-modulated signal remains constant, inde-
pendent of the modulation index. When unmodulated, all the power
is at the carrier frequency, and when modulated, the same total pow-
er is distributed among the carrier and the sidebands. At low modu-
lation indices the sidebands are grouped close to the carrier, and the
power spectral density, or wattage per unit bandwidth, is relatively
high in that spectral region. At high modulation indices, the spec-
trum becomes widely spread, and the power spectral density rela-
tively low.
Use is made of this property in certain situations to keep radiation
within CCIR recommended limits. For example, to limit the A2 mode
of interference in the 1- to 15-GHz range for the fixed satellite ser-
vice, CCIR Radio Regulations state in part that the earth station
EIRP should not exceed 40 dBW in any 4-kHz band for $  0° and
should not exceed (40  3$) dBW in any 4-kHz band for 0°  $ 
5°. The angle $ is the angle of elevation of the horizon viewed from
the center of radiation of the earth station antenna. It is positive for
angles above the horizontal plane, as illustrated in Fig. 13.7a, and
negative for angles below the horizontal plane, as illustrated in Fig.
13.7b.
For space stations transmitting in the frequency range 3400 to 7750
MHz, the limits are specified in terms of power flux density for any 4-
kHz bandwidth. Denoting the angle of arrival as  degrees, measured
above the horizontal plane as shown in Fig. 13.7c, these limits are
152 dBW/m2 in any 4-kHz band for 0°    5°
152  0.5 (  5) dBW/m2 in any 4-kHz band for 5°    25°

Because the specification is in terms of power or flux density in any
4-kHz band, not the total power or the total flux density, a carrier may
be within the limits when heavily frequency-modulated, but the same
carrier with light frequency modulation may exceed the limits. An
energy-dispersal waveform is a low-frequency modulating wave which
is inserted below the lowest baseband frequency for the purpose of dis-
persing the spectral energy when the current value of the modulating
index is low. In the INTELSAT system for FDM carriers, a symmetri-
cal triangular wave is used, a different fundamental frequency for this
triangular wave in the range 20 to 150 Hz being assigned to each FDM
carrier. The rms level of the baseband is monitored, and the amplitude
of the dispersal waveform is automatically adjusted to keep the over-
all frequency deviation within defined limits. At the receive end, the
dispersal waveform is removed from the demodulated signal by low-
pass filtering.
With television signals the situation is more complicated. The dis-
persal waveform, usually a sawtooth waveform, must be synchronized
with the field frequency of the video signal to prevent video interfer-
ence, so for the 525/60 standard, a 30-Hz wave is used, and for the
625/50 standard, a 25-Hz wave is used. If the TV signal occupies the

TLFeBOOK

full bandwidth of the transponder, known as full-transponder televi-
sion, the dispersal level is kept constant at a peak-to-peak deviation of
1 MHz irrespective of the video level. In what is termed half-transpon-
der television, where the TV carrier occupies only one-half of the avail-
able transponder bandwidth, the dispersal deviation is maintained at
1 MHz peak to peak when video modulation is present and is auto-
matically increased to 2 MHz when video modulation is absent. At the
receiver, video clamping is the most commonly used method of remov-
ing the dispersal waveform.
Energy dispersal is effective in reducing all modes of interference
but particularly that occurring between earth and terrestrial stations
(A2 mode) and between space and terrestrial stations (C1). It is also
effective in reducing intermodulation noise.
13.4
Coordination
When a new satellite network is in the planning stage, certain calcu-
lations have to be made to ensure that the interference levels will
remain within acceptable limits. These calculations include determin-
ing the interference that will be caused by the new system and inter-
ference it will receive from other satellite networks.
In Sec. 13.2, procedures were outlined showing how interference
may be calculated by taking into account modulation parameters and
carrier frequencies of wanted and interfering systems. These calcula-
tions are very complex, and the CCIR uses a simplified method to
determine whether coordination is necessary. As mentioned previous-
ly, where the potential for interference exists, the telecommunication
administrations are required to coordinate the steps to be taken to
reduce interference, a process referred to as coordination.
To determine whether or not coordination is necessary, the interfer-
ence level is calculated assuming maximum spectrum density levels of
the interfering signals and converted to an equivalent increase in
noise temperature. The method is specified in detail in CCIR Report
454–3 (1982) for a number of possible situations. To illustrate the
method, one specific situation will be explained here: that where the
existing and proposed systems operate on the same uplink and down-
link frequencies.
Figure 13.8a shows the two networks, R and R′. The method will be
described for network R′ interfering with the operation of R. Satellite
S′ can interfere with the earth station E, this being a B1 mode of inter-
ference, and earth station E′ can interfere with the satellite S, this
being a B2 mode. Note that the networks need not be physically adja-
cent to one another.

Consider first the interference B1. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.8b.
Let US represent the maximum power density transmitted from

Here, UE is the maximum power spectral density transmitted by earth

receive gain of S in the direction of E′, and LU is the uplink propaga-
tion loss.
13.4.2
Transmission gain
The effect of the equivalent temperature rise "TS must be trans-
ferred to the earth station E, and this is done using the transmis-
sion gain for system R, which is calculated for the situation shown
in Fig. 13.9. Figure 13.9a shows the satellite circuit in block
schematic form. UE represents the maximum power spectral densi-
ty transmitted by earth station E, and GTE represents the transmit
gain of E in direction S. GRS represents the receive gain of S in
direction E. The received power spectral density at satellite S is

where US is the maximum power spectral density transmitted by S,

for the interference signals.

Coordination criterion
CCIR Report 454–3 (1982) specifies that the equivalent noise-temper-
ature rise should be no more than 4 percent of the equivalent thermal
noise temperature of the satellite link. The equivalent thermal noise
temperature is defined in the CCIR Radio Regulations, App. 29.
As an example, the CCIR Recommendations for FM Telephony
allows up to 10,000 pW0p total noise in a telephone channel. The
abbreviation pW0p stands for picowatts at a zero-level test point,
psophometrically weighted, as already defined in connection with
Table 13.1. The 10,000-pW0p total includes a 1000-pW0p allowance for
terrestrial station interference and 1000 pW0p for interference from
other satellite links. Thus the thermal noise allowance is 10,000 
2000  8000 pW0p. Four percent of this is 320 pW0p. Assuming that
this is over a 3.1-kHz bandwidth, the spectrum density is 320/3100 or
approximately 0.1 pJ0p (pW0p/Hz). In decibels, this is 130 dBJ. This
is output noise, and to relate it back to the noise temperature at the
antenna, the overall gain of the receiver from antenna to output,
including the processing gain discussed in Sec. 9.6.3, must be known.
For illustration purposes, assume that the gain is 90 dB, so the anten-
na noise is 130  90  220 dBJ. The noise-temperature rise corre-
sponding to this is 220  228.6  8.6 dBK. Converting this to kelvins
gives 7.25 K.
13.4.5
Noise power spectral density
The concept of noise power spectral density was introduced in Sec.
12.5 for a flat frequency spectrum. Where the spectrum is not flat,
an average value for the spectral density can be calculated. To illus-
trate this, the very much simplified spectrum curve of Fig. 13.10 will
be used. The maximum spectrum density is flat at 3 W/Hz from 0 to
2 kHz and then slopes linearly down to zero over the range from 2 to
8 kHz.
The noise power in any given bandwidth is calculated as the area
under the curve, whose width is the value of the bandwidth. Thus, for
the first 2 kHz, the noise power is 3 W/Hz  2000  6000 W. From 2
to 8 kHz, the noise power is 3  (8  2)  1000/2  9000 W. The total
power is therefore 15,000 W, and the average spectral density is
15,000/8000  1.875 W/Hz.
The noise power spectral density over the worst 4-kHz bandwidth
must include the highest part of the curve and is therefore calculated
for the 0- to 4-kHz band. The power over this band is seen to be the
364
Chapter Thirteen
TLFeBOOK

area of the rectangle 3 W/Hz  4 kHz minus the area of the triangle
shown dashed in Fig. 13.10. The power over the 0- to 4-kHz band is
therefore (3  4000)  (3  2)  (4  2)  1000/2  11,000 W, and the
spectral density is 11,000/4000  2.75 W/Hz.
The units for spectral power density are often stated as watts per
hertz (W/Hz). Expressed in this manner the units are descriptive of
the way in which the power spectral density is arrived at. In terms of
fundamental units, watts are equivalent to joules per second and hertz
to cycles per second or simply seconds1 since cycles are a dimension-
less quantity. Thus 1 W/Hz is equivalent to 1 joule/second ÷ second1,
which is simply joules. The units for power spectral density therefore
can be stated as joules. This is verified by Eq. (12.15) for noise power
spectral density.

Satellite Access
14.1
Introduction
A transponder channel aboard a satellite may be fully loaded by a sin-
gle transmission from an earth station. This is referred to as a single-
access mode of operation. It is also possible, and more common, for a
transponder to be loaded by a number of carriers. These may originate
from a number of earth stations geographically separate, and each
earth station may transmit one or more of the carriers. This mode of
operation is termed multiple access. The need for multiple access aris-
es because more than two earth stations, in general, will be within the
service area of a satellite. Even so-called spot beams from satellite
antennas cover areas several hundred miles across.
The two most commonly used methods of multiple access are fre-
quency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple
access (TDMA). These are analogous to frequency-division multiplex-
ing (FDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) described in Chaps.
9 and 10. However, multiple access and multiplexing are different con-
cepts, and as pointed out in CCIR Report 708 (1982), modulation (and
hence multiplexing) is essentially a transmission feature, whereas
multiple access is essentially a traffic feature.
A third category of multiple access is code-division multiple access
(CDMA). In this method each signal is associated with a particular code
that is used to spread the signal in frequency and/or time. All such sig-
nals will be received simultaneously at an earth station, but by using
the key to the code, the station can recover the desired signal by means
of correlation. The other signals occupying the transponder channel
appear very much like random noise to the correlation decoder.

Multiple access also may be classified by the way in which circuits
are assigned to users (circuits in this context implies one communica-
tion channel through the multiple-access transponder). Circuits may
be preassigned, which means they are allocated on a fixed or partially
fixed basis to certain users. These circuits are therefore not available
for general use. Preassignment is simple to implement but is efficient
only for circuits with continuous heavy traffic.
An alternative to preassignment is demand-assigned multiple access
(DAMA). In this method, all circuits are available to all users and are
assigned according to the demand. DAMA results in more efficient over-
all use of the circuits but is more costly and complicated to implement.
Both FDMA and TDMA can be operated as preassigned or demand-
assigned systems. CDMA is a random-access system, there being no
control over the timing of the access or of the frequency slots accessed.
These multiple-access methods refer to the way in which a single
transponder channel is utilized. A satellite carries a number of
transponders, and normally each covers a different frequency channel,
as shown in Fig. 7.13. This provides a form of frequency-division mul-
tiple access to the whole satellite. It is also possible for transponders
to operate at the same frequency but to be connected to different spot-
beam antennas. These allow the satellite as a whole to be accessed by
earth stations widely separated geographically but transmitting on
the same frequency. This is termed frequency reuse. This method of
access is referred to as space-division multiple access (SDMA). It
should be kept in mind that each spot beam may itself be carrying sig-
nals in one of the other multiple-access formats.
14.2
Single Access
With single access, a single modulated carrier occupies the whole of
the available bandwidth of a transponder. Single-access operation is
used on heavy-traffic routes and requires large earth station antennas
such as the class A antenna shown in Fig. 8.7. As an example, Telesat
Canada provides heavy route message facilities, with each transpon-
der channel being capable of carrying 960 one-way voice circuits on an
FDM/FM carrier, as illustrated in Fig. 14.1. The earth station employs
a 30-m-diameter antenna and a parametric amplifier, which together
provide a minimum [G/T] of 37.5 dB/K.
14.3
Preassigned FDMA
Frequency slots may be preassigned to analog and digital signals, and
to illustrate the method, analog signals in the FDM/FM/FDMA format
will be considered first. As the acronyms indicate, the signals are fre-

quency-division multiplexed, frequency modulated (FM), with fre-
quency-division multiple access to the satellite. In Chap. 9, FDM/FM
signals are discussed. It will be recalled that the voice-frequency (tele-
phone) signals are first SSBSC amplitude modulated onto voice carri-
ers in order to generate the single sidebands needed for the
frequency-division multiplexing. For the purpose of illustration, each
earth station will be assumed to transmit a 60-channel supergroup.
Each 60-channel supergroup is then frequency modulated onto a car-
rier which is then upconverted to a frequency in the satellite uplink
band.
Figure 14.2 shows the situation for three earth stations: one in
Ottawa, one in New York, and one in London. All three earth stations
access a single satellite transponder channel simultaneously, and each
communicates with both of the others. Thus it is assumed that the
satellite receive and transmit antenna beams are global, encompass-
ing all three earth stations. Each earth station transmits one uplink
carrier modulated with a 60-channel supergroup and receives two sim-
ilar downlink carriers.
The earth station at New York is shown in more detail. One trans-
mit chain is used, and this carries telephone traffic for both Ottawa
and London. On the receive side, two receive chains must be provided,
one for the Ottawa-originated carrier and one for the London-originat-
ed carrier. Each of these carriers will have a mixture of traffic, and in
the demultiplexing unit, only those telephone channels intended for
New York are passed through. These are remultiplexed into an
FDM/FM format which is transmitted out along the terrestrial line to
the New York switching office. This earth station arrangement should
be compared with that shown in Fig. 8.6.
Figure 14.3 shows a hypothetical frequency assignment scheme for
the hypothetical network of Fig. 14.2. Uplink carrier frequencies of
6253, 6273, and 6278 MHz are shown for illustration purposes. For the
satellite transponder arrangement of Fig. 7.13, these carriers would be
translated down to frequencies of 4028, 4048, and 4053 MHz (i.e., the

corresponding 4-GHz-band downlink frequencies) and sent to
transponder 9 of the satellite. Typically, a 60-channel FDM/FM carri-
er occupies 5 MHz of transponder bandwidth, including guardbands. A
total frequency allowance of 15 MHz is therefore required for the three
stations, and each station receives all the traffic. The remainder of the
transponder bandwidth may be unused, or it may be occupied by oth-
er carriers, which are not shown.
As an example of preassignment, suppose that each station can
transmit up to 60 voice circuits and that 40 of these are preassigned to
the New York–London route. If these 40 circuits are fully loaded, addi-
tional calls on the New York–London route will be blocked even though
there may be idle circuits on the other preassigned routes.
Telesat Canada operates medium-route message facilities utilizing
FDM/FM/FDMA. Figure 14.4 shows how five carriers may be used to
support 168 voice channels. The earth station that carries the full load
has a [G/T] of 37.5 dB/K, and the other four have [G/T]’s of 28 dB/K.

Preassignment also may be made on the basis of a single channel
per carrier (SCPC). This refers to a single voice (or data) channel per
carrier, not a transponder channel, which may in fact carry some hun-
dreds of voice channels by this method. The carriers may be frequen-
cy modulated or phase-shift modulated, and an earth station may be
capable of transmitting one or more SCPC signals simultaneously.

TLFeBOOK

Figure 14.5 shows the INTELSAT SCPC channeling scheme for a
36-MHz transponder. The transponder bandwidth is subdivided into
800 channels each 45 kHz wide. The 45 kHz, which includes a guard-
band, is required for each digitized voice channel, which utilizes QPSK
modulation. The channel information signal may be digital data or
PCM voice signals (see Chap. 10). A pilot frequency is transmitted for
the purpose of frequency control, and the adjacent channel slots on
either side of the pilot are left vacant to avoid interference. The
scheme therefore provides a total of 798 one-way channels or up to 399
full-duplex voice circuits. In duplex operation, the frequency pairs are
separated by 18.045 MHz, as shown in Fig. 14.5.
The frequency tolerance relative to the assigned values is within 
±1 kHz for the received SCPC carrier and must be within ±250 Hz for
the transmitted SCPC carrier (Miya, 1981). The pilot frequency is trans-
mitted by one of the earth stations designated as a primary station. This
provides a reference for automatic frequency control (AFC) (usually
through the use of phase-locked loops) of the transmitter frequency syn-
thesizers and receiver local oscillators. In the event of failure of the pri-
mary station, the pilot frequency is transmitted from a designated
backup station.
An important feature of the INTELSAT SCPC system is that each
channel is voice-activated. This means that on a two-way telephone
conversation, only one carrier is operative at any one time. Also, in
long pauses between speech, the carriers are switched off. It has been
estimated that for telephone calls, the one-way utilization time is 40
percent of the call duration. Using voice activation, the average num-
ber of carriers being amplified at any one time by the transponder
traveling-wave tube (TWT) is reduced. For a given level of intermodu-
lation distortion (see Secs. 7.7.3 and 12.10), the TWT power output per
FDMA carrier therefore can be increased.

SCPC systems are widely used on lightly loaded routes, this type of
service being referred to as a thin route service. It enables remote earth
stations in sparsely populated areas to connect into the national tele-
phone network in a reasonably economical way. A main earth station
is used to make the connection to the telephone network, as illustrat-
ed in Fig. 14.6. The Telesat Canada Thin Route Message Facilities pro-
vide up to 360 two-way circuits using PSK/SCPC (PSK  phase-shift
keying). The remote terminals operate with 4.6-m-diameter antennas
with [G/T] values of 19.5 or 21 dB/K. Transportable terminals are also
available, one of these being shown in Fig. 14.7. This is a single-chan-
nel station that uses a 3.6-m antenna and comes complete with a desk-
top electronics package which can be installed on the customers’
premises.
14.4
Demand-Assigned FDMA
In the demand-assigned mode of operation, the transponder frequency
bandwidth is subdivided into a number of channels. A channel is
assigned to each carrier in use, giving rise to the single-channel-per-
carrier mode of operation discussed in the preceding section. As in the
preassigned access mode, carriers may be frequency modulated with
analog information signals, these being designated FM/SCPC, or they
may be phase modulated with digital information signals, these being
designated as PSK/SCPC.

TLFeBOOK

Demand assignment may be carried out in a number of ways. In the
polling method, a master earth station continuously polls all the earth
stations in sequence, and if a call request is encountered, frequency
slots are assigned from the pool of available frequencies. The polling
delay with such a system tends to become excessive as the number of
participating earth stations increases.
Instead of using a polling sequence, earth stations may request calls
through the master earth station as the need arises. This is referred to
as centrally controlled random access. The requests go over a digital
orderwire, which is a narrowband digital radio link or a circuit
through a satellite transponder reserved for this purpose. Frequencies
are assigned, if available, by the master station, and when the call is
completed, the frequencies are returned to the pool. If no frequencies
are available, the blocked call requests may be placed in a queue, or a
second call attempt may be initiated by the requesting station.
As an alternative to centrally controlled random access, control may
be exercised at each earth station, this being known as distributed-
control random access. A good illustration of such a system is provided
by the Spade system operated by INTELSAT on some of its satellites.
This is described in the next section.
14.5
Spade System
The word Spade is a loose acronym for single-channel-per-carrier pulse-
code-modulated multiple-access demand-assignment equipment. Spade
was developed by Comsat for use on the INTELSAT satellites (see, e.g.,
Martin, 1978) and is compatible with the INTELSAT SCPC preassigned

system described in Sec. 14.3. However, the distributed-demand assign-
ment facility requires a common signaling channel (CSC). This is shown
in Fig. 14.8. The CSC bandwidth is 160 kHz, and its center frequency is
18.045 MHz below the pilot frequency, as shown in Fig. 14.8. To avoid
interference with the CSC, voice channels 1 and 2 are left vacant, and
to maintain duplex matching, the corresponding channels 1′ and 2′ are
also left vacant. Recalling from Fig. 14.5 that channel 400 also must be
left vacant, this requires that channel 800 be left vacant for duplex
matching. Thus six channels are removed from the total of 800, leaving
a total of 794 one-way or 397 full-duplex voice circuits, the frequencies
in any pair being separated by 18.045 MHz, as shown in Fig. 14.8. (An
alternative arrangement is shown in Freeman, 1981.)
All the earth stations are permanently connected through the com-
mon signaling channel (CSC). This is shown diagrammatically in Fig.
14.9 for six earth stations A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each earth station has
the facility for generating any one of the 794 carrier frequencies using
frequency synthesizers. Furthermore, each earth station has a memo-
ry containing a list of the frequencies currently available, and this list
is continuously updated through the CSC. To illustrate the procedure,
suppose that a call to station F is initiated from station C in Fig. 14.9.
Station C will first select a frequency pair at random from those cur-
rently available on the list and signal this information to station F
through the CSC. Station F must acknowledge, through the CSC, that
it can complete the circuit. Once the circuit is established, the other
earth stations are instructed, through the CSC, to remove this fre-

The round-trip time between station C initiating the call and station
F acknowledging it is about 600 ms. During this time, the two frequen-
cies chosen at station C may be assigned to another circuit. In this

event, station C will receive the information on the CSC update and will
immediately choose another pair at random, even before hearing back
from station F.
Once a call has been completed and the circuit disconnected, the two
frequencies are returned to the pool, the information again being
transmitted through the CSC to all the earth stations.
As well as establishing the connection through the satellite, the CSC
passes signaling information from the calling station to the destina-
tion station, in the example above from station C to station F.
Signaling information in the Spade system is routed through the CSC
rather than being sent over a voice channel. Each earth station has
equipment called the demand assignment signaling and switching
(DASS) unit which performs the functions required by the CSC.
Some type of multiple access to the CSC must be provided for all
the earth stations using the Spade system. This is quite separate
from the SCPC multiple access of the network’s voice circuits. Time-
division multiple access, described in Sec. 14.7.8, is used for this pur-
pose, allowing up to 49 earth stations to access the common signaling
channel.

Bandwidth-Limited and Power-Limited
TWT Amplifier Operation
A transponder will have a total bandwidth BTR, and it is apparent that
this can impose a limitation on the number of carriers which can
access the transponder in an FDMA mode. For example, if there are K
carriers each of bandwidth B, then the best that can be achieved is 
K  BTR/B. Any increase in the transponder EIRP will not improve on
this, and the system is said to be bandwidth-limited. Likewise, for dig-
ital systems, the bit rate is determined by the bandwidth, which again
will be limited to some maximum value by BTR.
Power limitation occurs where the EIRP is insufficient to meet the
[C/N] requirements, as shown by Eq. (12.34). The signal bandwidth
will be approximately equal to the noise bandwidth, and if the EIRP is
below a certain level, the bandwidth will have to be correspondingly
reduced to maintain the [C/N] at the required value. These limitations
are discussed in more detail in the next two sections.
14.6.1
FDMA downlink analysis
To see the effects of intermodulation noise which results with FDMA
operation, consider the overall carrier-to-noise ratio as given by Eq.
(12.62). In terms of noise power rather than noise power density, 
Eq. (12.62) states

(14.1)
A certain value of carrier-to-noise ratio will be needed, as specified
in the system design, and this will be denoted by the subscript REQ.
The overall C/N must be at least as great as the required value, a con-
dition which can therefore be stated as
 
REQ

(14.2)
Note that because the noise-to-carrier ratio rather than the carrier-
to-noise ratio is involved, the actual value is equal to or less than the
required value. Using Eq. (14.1), the condition can be rewritten as

The right-hand side of Eq. (14.3) is usually dominated by the down-

tion noise to an acceptable level, and as shown in Sec. 12.10, the

To set up a reference level, consider first single-carrier operation.
The satellite will have a saturation value of EIRP and a transponder
bandwidth BTR, both of which are assumed fixed. With single-carrier
access, no backoff is needed, and Eq. (14.6) becomes

alently,  is fractional. The following example illustrates the limitation
imposed by backoff.
Example 14.1
A satellite transponder has a bandwidth of 36 MHz and
a saturation EIRP of 27 dBW. The earth station receiver has a G/T ratio
of 30 dB/K, and the total link losses are 196 dB. The transponder is
accessed by FDMA carriers each of 3-MHz bandwidth, and 6-dB output
backoff is employed. Calculate the downlink carrier-to-noise ratio for sin-
gle-carrier operation and the number of carriers which can be accommo-
dated in the FDMA system. Compare this with the number which could
be accommodated if no backoff were needed. The carrier-to-noise ratio
determined for single-carrier operation may be taken as the reference
value, and it may be assumed that the uplink noise and intermodulation
noise are negligible.

TDMA
With time-division multiple access, only one carrier uses the transpon-
der at any one time, and therefore, intermodulation products, which
result from the nonlinear amplification of multiple carriers, are
absent. This leads to one of the most significant advantages of TDMA,
which is that the transponder traveling-wave tube (TWT) can be oper-
ated at maximum power output or saturation level.
Because the signal information is transmitted in bursts, TDMA is
only suited to digital signals. Digital data can be assembled into burst
format for transmission and reassembled from the received bursts
through the use of digital buffer memories.
Figure 14.10 illustrates the basic TDMA concept, in which the sta-
tions transmit bursts in sequence. Burst synchronization is required,
and in the system illustrated in Fig. 14.10, one station is assigned sole-

ly for the purpose of transmitting reference bursts to which the others
can be synchronized. The time interval from the start of one reference
burst to the next is termed a frame. A frame contains the reference
burst R and the bursts from the other earth stations, these being
shown as A, B, and C in Fig. 14.10.
Figure 14.11 illustrates the basic principles of burst transmission for
a single channel. Overall, the transmission appears continuous
because the input and output bit rates are continuous and equal.
However, within the transmission channel, input bits are temporarily
stored and transmitted in bursts. Since the time interval between
bursts is the frame time TF, the required buffer capacity is
M  RbTF
(14.15)
The buffer memory fills up at the input bit rate Rb during the frame
time interval. These M bits are transmitted as a burst in the next
frame without any break in continuity of the input. The M bits are
transmitted in the burst time TB, and the transmission rate, which is
equal to the burst bit rate, is
R TDMA 
 Rb
(14.16)
This is also referred to as the burst rate, but note that this means
the instantaneous bit rate within a burst (not the number of bursts per
second, which is simply equal to the frame rate). It will be seen that
the average bit rate for the burst mode is simply M/TF, which is equal
to the input and output rates.
The frame time TF will be seen to add to the overall propagation
delay. For example, in the simple system illustrated in Fig. 14.11, even
if the actual propagation delay between transmit and receive buffers
is assumed to be zero, the receiving side would still have to wait a time

TF before receiving the first transmitted burst. In a geostationary
satellite system, the actual propagation delay is a significant fraction
of a second, and excessive delays from other causes must be avoided.
This sets an upper limit to the frame time, although with current tech-
nology other factors restrict the frame time to well below this limit.
The frame period is usually chosen to be a multiple of 125 s, which is
the standard sampling period used in pulse-code modulation (PCM)
telephony systems, since this ensures that the PCM samples can be
distributed across successive frames at the PCM sampling rate.
Figure 14.12 shows some of the basic units in a TDMA ground station,
which for discussion purposes is labeled earth station A. Terrestrial
links coming into earth station A carry digital traffic addressed to des-
tination stations, labeled B, C, X. It is assumed that the bit rate is the
same for the digital traffic on each terrestrial link. In the units labeled
terrestrial interface modules (TIMs), the incoming continuous-bit-rate
signals are converted into the intermittent-burst-rate mode. These indi-
vidual burst-mode signals are time-division multiplexed in the time-
division multiplexer (MUX) so that the traffic for each destination
station appears in its assigned time slot within a burst.
Certain time slots at the beginning of each burst are used to carry
timing and synchronizing information. These time slots collectively
are referred to as the preamble. The complete burst containing the pre-
amble and the traffic data is used to phase modulate the radiofre-
quency (rf) carrier. Thus the composite burst which is transmitted at
rf consists of a number of time slots, as shown in Fig. 14.13. These will
be described in more detail shortly.
The received signal at an earth station consists of bursts from all
transmitting stations arranged in the frame format shown in Fig.
14.13. The rf carrier is converted to intermediate frequency (IF), which
is then demodulated. A separate preamble detector provides timing
information for transmitter and receiver along with a carrier synchro-
nizing signal for the phase demodulator, as described in the next sec-
tion. In many systems, a station receives its own transmission along
with the others in the frame, which can then be used for burst-timing
purposes.
A reference burst is required at the beginning of each frame to provide
timing information for the acquisition and synchronization of bursts
(these functions are described further in Sec. 14.7.4). In the INTELSAT
international network, at least two reference stations are used, one in
the East and one in the West. These are designated primary reference
stations, one of which is further selected as the master primary. Each
primary station is duplicated by a secondary reference station, making
four reference stations in all. The fact that all the reference stations are
identical means that any one can become the master primary. All the
Satellite Access
385
TLFeBOOK

system timing is derived from the high-stability clock in the master pri-
mary, which is accurate to 1 part in 1011 (Lewis, 1982). A clock on the
satellite is locked to the master primary, and this acts as the clock for
the other participating earth stations. The satellite clock will provide a
constant frame time, but the participating earth stations must make
386

corrections for variations in the satellite range, since the transmitted
bursts from all the participating earth stations must reach the satellite
in synchronism. Details of the timing requirements will be found in
Spilker (1977).
In the INTELSAT system, two reference bursts are transmitted in
each frame. The first reference burst, which marks the beginning of a
frame, is transmitted by a master primary (or a primary) reference
station and contains the timing information needed for the acquisition
and synchronization of bursts. The second reference burst, which is
transmitted by a secondary reference station, provides synchroniza-
tion but not acquisition information. The secondary reference burst is
ignored by the receiving earth stations unless the primary or master
primary station fails.
14.7.1
Reference burst
The reference burst that marks the beginning of a frame is subdivid-
ed into time slots or channels used for various functions. These will
differ in detail for different networks, but Fig. 14.13 shows some of
the basic channels that are usually provided. These can be summa-
rized as follows:
Guard time (G). A guard time is necessary between bursts to prevent
the bursts from overlapping. The guard time will vary from burst to
burst depending on the accuracy with which the various bursts can
be positioned within each frame.

Carrier and bit-timing recovery (CBR). To perform coherent demod-
ulation of the phase-modulated carrier as described in Secs. 10.7 and
10.8, a coherent carrier signal must first be recovered from the
burst. An unmodulated carrier wave is provided during the first part
of the CBR time slot. This is used as a synchronizing signal for a
local oscillator at the detector, which then produces an output coher-
ent with the carrier wave. The carrier in the subsequent part of the
CBR time slot is modulated by a known phase-change sequence
which enables the bit timing to be recovered. Accurate bit timing is
needed for the operation of the sample-and-hold function in the
detector circuit (see Figs. 10.13 and 10.23). Carrier recovery is
described in more detail in Sec. 14.7.3.
Burst code word (BCW). (Also known as a unique word.) This is a
binary word, a copy of which is stored at each earth station. By com-
paring the incoming bits in a burst with the stored version of the
BCW, the receiver can detect when a group of received bits matches
the BCW, and this in turn provides an accurate time reference for
the burst position in the frame. A known bit sequence is also carried
in the BCW, which enables the phase ambiguity associated with
coherent detection to be resolved.
Station identification code (SIC). This identifies the transmitting
station.
Figure 14.14 shows the makeup of the reference bursts used in cer-
tain of the INTELSAT networks. The numbers of symbols and the cor-
responding time intervals allocated to the various functions are
shown. In addition to the channels already described, a coordination
and delay channel (sometimes referred to as the control and delay
channel) is provided. This channel carries the identification number of
the earth station being addressed and various codes used in connection
with the acquisition and synchronization of bursts at the addressed
earth station. It is also necessary for an earth station to know the
propagation time delay to the satellite to implement burst acquisition
and synchronization. In the INTELSAT system, the propagation delay
is computed from measurements made at the reference station and
transmitted to the earth station in question through the coordination
and delay channel.
The other channels in the INTELSAT reference burst are the fol-
lowing:
TTY: telegraph order-wire channel, used to provide telegraph com-
munications between earth stations.
SC: service channel which carries various network protocol and
alarm messages.

14.7.2
Preamble and postamble
The preamble is the initial portion of a traffic burst which carries
information similar to that carried in the reference burst. In some sys-
tems the channel allocations in the reference bursts and the preambles
are identical. No traffic is carried in the preamble. In Fig. 14.13, the
only difference between the preamble and the reference burst is that
the preamble provides an orderwire (OW) channel.
For the INTELSAT format shown in Fig. 14.14, the preamble differs
from the reference burst in that it does not provide a coordination and
delay channel (CDC). Otherwise, the two are identical.
As with the reference bursts, the preamble provides a carrier and
bit-timing recovery channel and also a burst-code-word channel for
burst-timing purposes. The burst code word in the preamble of a traf-
fic burst is different from the burst code word in the reference bursts,
which enables the two types of bursts to be identified.

TLFeBOOK

In certain phase detection systems, the phase detector must be
allowed time to recover from one burst before the next burst is received
by it. This is termed decoder quenching, and a time slot, referred to as a
postamble, is allowed for this function. The postamble is shown as Q in
Fig. 14.13. Many systems are designed to operate without a postamble.
14.7.3
Carrier recovery
A factor which must be taken into account with TDMA is that the var-
ious bursts in a frame lack coherence so that carrier recovery must be
repeated for each burst. This applies to the traffic as well as the refer-
ence bursts. Where the carrier recovery circuit employs a phase-locked
loop such as shown in Fig. 10.20, a problem known as hangup can
occur. This arises when the loop moves to an unstable region of its
operating characteristic. The loop operation is such that it eventually
returns to a stable operating point, but the time required to do this
may be unacceptably long for burst-type signals.
One alternative method utilizes a narrowband tuned circuit filter to
recover the carrier. An example of such a circuit for quadrature phase-
shift keying (QPSK), taken from Miya (1981), is shown in Fig. 14.15. The
QPSK signal, which has been downconverted to a standard IF of 140
MHz, is quadrupled in frequency to remove the modulation, as described
in Sec. 10.7. The input frequency must be maintained at the resonant
frequency of the tuned circuit, which requires some form of automatic
frequency control. Because of the difficulties inherent in working with
high frequencies, the output frequency of the quadrupler is downcon-
verted from 560 to 40 MHz, and the AFC is applied to the voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) used to make the frequency conversion. The
AFC circuit is a form of phase-locked loop (PLL) in which the phase dif-
ference between input and output of the single-tuned circuit is held at
zero, which ensures that the 40-MHz input remains at the center of the
tuned circuit response curve. Any deviation of the phase difference from
zero generates a control voltage which is applied to the VCO in such a
way as to bring the frequency back to the required value.
Interburst interference may be a problem with the tuned-circuit
method because of the energy stored in the tuned circuit for any given
burst. Avoidance of interburst interference requires careful design of
the tuned circuit (Miya, 1981) and possibly the use of a postamble, as
mentioned in the previous section.
Other methods of carrier recovery are discussed in Gagliardi (1991).
14.7.4
Network synchronization
Network synchronization is required to ensure that all bursts arrive at
the satellite in their correct time slots. As mentioned previously, tim-
390
Chapter Fourteen
TLFeBOOK

ing markers are provided by the reference bursts, which are tied to a
highly stable clock at the reference station and transmitted through
the satellite link to the traffic stations. At any given traffic station,
detection of the unique word (or burst code word) in the reference
burst signals the start of receiving frame (SORF), the marker coincid-
ing with the last bit in the unique word.
It would be desirable to have the highly stable clock located aboard
the satellite because this would eliminate the variations in propagation
delay arising from the uplink for the reference station, but this is not
practical because of weight and space limitations. However, the refer-
ence bursts retransmitted from the satellite can be treated, for timing
purposes, as if they originated from the satellite (Spilker, 1977).
The network operates what is termed a burst time plan, a copy of
which is stored at each earth station. The burst time plan shows each
earth station where the receive bursts intended for it are relative to the
SORF marker. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.16. At earth station A the
SORF marker is received after some propagation delay tA, and the
burst time plan tells station A that a burst intended for it follows at
time TA after the SORF marker received by it. Likewise, for station B,
the propagation delay is tB, and the received bursts start at TB after the
SORF markers received at station B. The propagation delays for each
station will differ, but typically they are in the region of 120 ms each.
The burst time plan also shows a station when it must transmit its
bursts in order to reach the satellite in the correct time slots. A major
advantage of the TDMA mode of operation is that the burst time plan
is essentially under software control so that changes in traffic pat-
terns can be accommodated much more readily than is the case with
FDMA, where modifications to hardware are required. Against this,

TLFeBOOK

implementation of the synchronization is a complicated process.
Corrections must be included for changes in propagation delay which
result from the slowly varying position of the satellite (see Sec. 7.4).
In general, the procedure for transmit timing control has two stages.
First, there is the need for a station just entering, or reentering after
a long delay, to acquire its correct slot position, this being referred to
as burst position acquisition. Once the time slot has been acquired,
the traffic station must maintain the correct position, this being
known as burst position synchronization.
Open-loop timing control.
This is the simplest method of transmit tim-
ing. A station transmits at a fixed interval following reception of the
timing markers, according to the burst time plan, and sufficient
guard time is allowed to absorb the variations in propagation delay.
The burst position error can be large with this method, and longer
guard times are necessary, which reduces frame efficiency (see Sec.
14.7.7). However, for frame times longer than about 45 ms, the loss of
efficiency is less than 10 percent. In a modified version of the open-
loop method known as adaptive open-loop timing, the range is com-
puted at the traffic station from orbital data or from measurements,
and the traffic earth station makes its own corrections in timing to
allow for the variations in the range. It should be noted that with
open-loop timing, no special acquisition procedure is required.
Loopback timing control.
Loopback refers to the fact that an earth
station receives its own transmission, from which it can determine
range. It follows that the loopback method can only be used where
the satellite transmits a global or regional beam encompassing all

the earth stations in the network. A number of methods are available
for the acquisition process (see, for example, Gagliardi, 1991), but
basically, these all require some form of ranging to be carried out so
that a close estimate of the slot position can be acquired. In one
method, the traffic station transmits a low-level burst consisting of
the preamble only. The power level is 20 to 25 dB below the normal
operating level (Ha, 1990) to prevent interference with other bursts,
and the short burst is swept through the frame until it is observed to
fall within the assigned time slot for the station. The short burst is
then increased to full power, and fine adjustments in timing are
made to bring it to the beginning of the time slot. Acquisition can
take up to about 3 s in some cases. Following acquisition, the traffic
data can be added, and synchronization can be maintained by con-
tinuously monitoring the position of the loopback transmission with
reference to the SORF marker. The timing positions are reckoned
from the last bit of the unique word in the preamble (as is also the
case for the reference burst). The loopback method is also known as
direct closed-loop feedback.
Feedback timing control.
Where a traffic station lies outside the satel-
lite beam containing its own transmission, loopback of the transmis-
sion does not of course occur, and some other method must be used for
the station to receive ranging information. Where the synchronization
information is transmitted back to an earth station from a distant sta-
tion, this is termed feedback closed-loop control. The distant station
may be a reference station, as in the INTELSAT network, or it may be
another traffic station which is a designated partner. During the acqui-
sition stage, the distant station can feed back information to guide the
positioning of the short burst, and once the correct time slot is
acquired, the necessary synchronizing information can be fed back on
a continuous basis.
Figure 14.17 illustrates the feedback closed-loop control method for
two earth stations A and B. The SORF marker is used as a reference
point for the burst transmissions. However, the reference point which
denotes the start of transmit frame (SOTF) has to be delayed by a cer-
tain amount, shown as DA for earth station A and DB for earth station
B. This is necessary so that the SOTF reference points for each earth
station coincide at the satellite transponder, and the traffic bursts,
which are transmitted at their designated times after the SOTF, arrive
in their correct relative positions at the transponder, as shown in Fig.
14.17. The total time delay between any given satellite clock pulse and
the corresponding SOTF is a constant, shown as C in Fig. 14.17. C is
equal to 2tA  DA for station A and 2tB  DB for station B. In general,

In the INTELSAT network, C  288 ms.
For a truly geostationary satellite, the propagation delay ti would
be constant. However, as shown in Sec. 7.4, station-keeping maneu-
vers are required to keep a geostationary satellite at its assigned
orbital position, and hence this position can be held only within cer-
tain tolerances. For example, in the INTELSAT network, the varia-
tion in satellite position can lead to a variation of up to ±0.55 ms in
the propagation delay (INTELSAT, 1980). In order to minimize the
guard time needed between bursts, this variation in propagation
delay must be taken into account in determining the delay Di required
at each traffic station. In the INTELSAT network, the Di numbers are
updated every 512 frames, which is a period of 1.024 s, based on mea-
surements and calculations of the propagation delay times made at
the reference station. The Di numbers are transmitted to the earth
stations through the CDC channel in the reference bursts. (It should
be noted that the open-loop synchronization described previously
amounts to using a constant Di value.)
The use of traffic burst preambles along with reference bursts to
achieve synchronization is the most common method, but at least one
other method, not requiring preambles, has been proposed by Nuspl
and de Buda (1974). It also should be noted that there are certain

types of “packet satellite networks,” for example, the basic Aloha sys-
tem (Rosner, 1982), which are closely related to TDMA, in which syn-
chronization is not used.
14.7.5
Unique word detection
The unique word (UW) or burst code word (BCW) is used to establish
burst timing in TDMA. Figure 14.18 shows the basic arrangement for
detecting the UW. The received bit stream is passed through a shift
register which forms part of a correlator. As the bit stream moves
through the register, the sequence is continuously compared with a
stored version of the UW. When correlation is achieved, indicated by a
high output from the threshold detector, the last bit of the UW pro-
vides the reference point for timing purposes. It is important therefore
to know the probability of error in detecting the UW. Two possibilities
have to be considered. One, termed the miss probability, is the proba-
bility of the correlation detector failing to detect the UW even though
it is present in the bit stream. The other, termed the probability of
false alarm, is the probability that the correlation detector misreads a
sequence as the UW. Both of these will be examined in turn.
Miss probability.
Let E represent the maximum number of errors
allowed in the UW of length N bits, and let I represent the actual
number of errors in the UW as received. The following conditions
apply:
When I  E, the detected sequence is declared to be the UW.
When I  E, the detected sequence N is declared not to be the UW;
that is, the unique word is missed.
Let p represent the average probability of error in transmission (the
BER). The probability of receiving a sequence N containing I errors in
any one particular arrangement is
pI  pI (1  p)N  I
(14.18)
The number of combinations of N things taken I at a time, usually
written as NCI, is given by

Now since the UW is just such a sequence, Eq. (14.20) gives the
probability of a UW containing I errors. The condition for a miss occur-
ring is that I  E, and therefore, the miss probability is

Equation (14.22) gives the average probability of missing the UW even
though it is present in the shift register of the correlator. Note that
because this is an average probability, it is not necessary to know any
specific value of I. Example 14.2 shows this worked in Mathcad.

False detection probability.
Consider now a sequence of N which is not
the UW but which would be interpreted as the UW even if it differs
from it in some number of bit positions E, and let I represent the num-
ber of bit positions by which the random sequence actually does differ
from the UW. Thus E represents the number of acceptable “bit errors”
considered from the point of view of the UW, although they may not
be errors in the message they represent. Likewise, I represents the
actual number of “bit errors” considered from the point of view of the
UW, although they may not be errors in the message they represent.
As before, the number of combinations of N things taken I at a time
is given by Eq. (14.19), and hence the number of words acceptable as
the UW is
W  
E
I  0
NCI
(14.23)
The number of words which can be formed from a random sequence
of N bits is 2N, and on the assumption that all such words are
equiprobable, the probability of receiving any one particular word is
2N. Hence the probability of a false detection is
PF  2NW
(14.24)
Written out in full, this is
PF  2N 
E
I  0
(14.25)
Again it will be noticed that because this is an average probability,
it is not necessary to know a specific value of I. Also, in this case, the
BER does not enter into the calculation. A Mathcad calculation is giv-
en in Example 14.3.

is true in general. In practice, once frame synchronization has been
established, a time window can be formed around the expected time
of arrival for the UW such that the correlation detector is only in oper-
ation for the window period. This greatly reduces the probability of
false detection.
14.7.6
Traffic data
The traffic data immediately follow the preamble in a burst. As shown
in Fig. 14.13, the traffic data subburst is further subdivided into time
slots addressed to the individual destination stations. Any given desti-
nation station selects only the data in the time slots intended for that
station. As with FDMA networks, TDMA networks can be operated
with both preassigned and demand assigned channels, and examples
of both types will be given shortly.
The greater the fraction of frame time that is given over to traffic,
the higher is the efficiency. The concept of frame efficiency is discussed
in the next section.
14.7.7
Frame efficiency and channel
capacity
The frame efficiency is a measure of the fraction of frame time used for
the transmission of traffic. Frame efficiency may be defined as
Frame efficiency  F 
(14.26)
Alternatively, this can be written as
F  1  
(14.27)
In these equations, bits per frame are implied. The overhead bits
consist of the sum of the preamble, the postamble, the guard intervals,
and the reference-burst bits per frame. The equations may be stated in
terms of symbols rather than bits, or the actual times may be used.
For a fixed overhead, Eq. (14.27) shows that a longer frame, or
greater number of total bits, results in higher efficiency. However,
longer frames require larger buffer memories and also add to the prop-
agation delay. Synchronization also may be made more difficult, keep-
ing in mind that the satellite position is varying with time. It is clear
that a lower overhead also leads to higher efficiency, but again, reduc-
ing synchronizing and guard times may result in more complex equip-
ment being required.

The voice-channel capacity of a frame, which is also the voice-chan-
nel capacity of the transponder being accessed by the frame, can be
found from a knowledge of the frame efficiency and the bit rates. Let
Rb be the bit rate of a voice channel, and let there be a total of n voice
channels shared between all the earth stations accessing the transpon-
der. The total incoming traffic bit rate to a frame is nRb. The traffic bit

Preassigned TDMA
An example of a preassigned TDMA network is the common signaling
channel (CSC) for the Spade network described in Sec. 14.5. The frame
and burst formats are shown in Fig. 14.19. The CSC can accommodate
up to 49 earth stations in the network plus one reference station, mak-
ing a maximum of 50 bursts in a frame.

All the bursts are of equal length. Each burst contains 128 bits and
occupies a 1-ms time slot. Thus the bit rate is 128 kb/s. As discussed in
Sec. 14.5, the frequency bandwidth required for the CSC is 160 kHz.
The signaling unit (SU) shown in Fig. 14.19 is that section of the
data burst which is used to update the other stations on the status of
the frequencies available for the SCPC calls. It also carries the signal-
ing information, as described in Sec. 14.5.
Another example of a preassigned TDMA frame format is the
INTELSAT frame shown in simplified form in Fig. 14.20. In the
INTELSAT system, preassigned and demand-assigned voice channels
are carried together, but for clarity, only a preassigned traffic burst is
shown. The traffic burst is subdivided into time slots, termed satellite

channels in the INTELSAT terminology, and there can be up to 128 of
these in a traffic burst. Each satellite channel is further subdivided
into 16 time slots termed terrestrial channels, each terrestrial channel
carrying one PCM sample of an analog telephone signal. QPSK modu-
lation is used, and therefore, there are 2 bits per symbol as shown.
Thus each terrestrial channel carries 4 symbols (or 8 bits). Each satel-
lite channel carries 4  16  64 symbols, and at its maximum of 128
satellite channels, the traffic burst carries 8192 symbols.
As discussed in Sec. 10.3, the PCM sampling rate is 8 kHz, and with
8 bits per sample, the PCM bit rate is 64 kb/s. Each satellite channel can
accommodate this bit rate. Where input data at a higher rate must be
transmitted, multiple satellite channels are used. The maximum input
data rate which can be handled is 128(SC)  64 kb/s  8.192 Mb/s.
The INTELSAT frame is 120,832 symbols or 241,664 bits long. The
frame period is 2 ms, and therefore, the burst bit rate is 120.832 Mb/s.
As mentioned previously, preassigned and demand-assigned voice
channels can be accommodated together in the INTELSAT frame for-
mat. The demand-assigned channels utilize a technique known as dig-
ital speech interpolation (DSI), which is described in the next section.
The preassigned channels are referred to as digital noninterpolated
(DNI) channels.
14.7.9
Demand-assigned TDMA
With TDMA, the burst and subburst assignments are under software
control, compared with hardware control of the carrier frequency
assignments in FDMA. Consequently, compared with FDMA net-
works, TDMA networks have more flexibility in reassigning channels,
and the changes can be made more quickly and easily.
A number of methods are available for providing traffic flexibility
with TDMA. The burst length assigned to a station may be varied as
the traffic demand varies. A central control station may be employed
by the network to control the assignment of burst lengths to each par-
ticipating station. Alternatively, each station may determine its own
burst-length requirements and assign these in accordance with a pre-
arranged network discipline.
As an alternative to burst-length variation, the burst length may be
kept constant and the number of bursts per frame used by a given sta-
tion varied as demand requires. In one proposed system (CCIR Report
708, 1982), the frame length is fixed at 13.5 ms. The basic burst time
slot is 62.5 s, and stations in the network transmit information
bursts varying in discrete steps over the range 0.5 ms (8 basic bursts)
to 4.5 ms (72 basic bursts) per frame. Demand assignment for speech
channels takes advantage of the intermittent nature of speech, as
described in the next section.
402
Chapter Fourteen
TLFeBOOK

14.7.10
Speech interpolation and predic-
tion
Because of the intermittent nature of speech, a speech transmission
channel lies inactive for a considerable fraction of the time it is in use.
A number of factors contribute to this. The talk-listen nature of a nor-
mal two-way telephone conversation means that transmission in any
one direction occurs only about 50 percent of the time. In addition, the
pauses between words and phrases may further decrease this to about
33 percent. If further allowance is made for “end party” delays such as
the time required for a party to answer a call, the average fraction of
the total connect time may drop to as low as 25 percent. The fraction
of time a transmission channel is active is known as the telephone load
activity factor, and for system design studies, the value of 0.25 is rec-
ommended by Comité Consutatif Internationale Télégraphique et
Téléphonique (CCITT), although higher values are also used (Pratt
and Bostian, 1986). The point is that for a significant fraction of the
time the channel is available for other transmissions, and advantage
is taken of this in a form of demand assignment known as digital
speech interpolation.
Digital speech interpolation may be implemented in one of two
ways, these being digital time assignment speech interpolation (digital
TASI) and speech predictive encoded communications (SPEC).
Digital TASI.
The traffic-burst format for an INTELSAT burst carrying
demand-assigned channels and preassigned channels is shown in Fig.
14.21. As mentioned previously, the demand-assigned channels utilize
digital TASI, or what is referred to in the INTELSAT nomenclature as

DSI, for digital speech interpolation. These are shown by the block
labeled “interpolated” in Fig. 14.21. The first satellite channel (chan-
nel 0) in this block is an assignment channel, labeled DSI-AC. No traf-
fic is carried in the assignment channel; it is used to transmit channel
assignment information as will be described shortly.
Figure 14.22 shows in outline the DSI system. Basically, the system
allows N terrestrial channels to be carried by M satellite channels,
where N  M. For example, in the INTELSAT arrangement, N  240
and M  127.
On each incoming terrestrial channel, a speech detector senses
when speech is present, the intermittent speech signals being referred
to as speech spurts. A speech spurt lasts on average about 1.5 seconds
(Miya, 1981). A control signal from the speech detector is sent to the
channel assignment unit, which searches for an empty TDMA buffer.
Assuming that one is found, the terrestrial channel is assigned to this
satellite channel, and the speech spurt is stored in the buffer, ready for
transmission in the DSI subburst. A delay is inserted in the speech cir-
cuit, as shown in Fig. 14.22, to allow some time for the assignment
process to be completed. However, this delay cannot exactly compen-
sate for the assignment delay, and the initial part of the speech spurt
may be lost. This is termed a connect clip.
In the INTELSAT system an intermediate step occurs where the ter-
restrial channels are renamed international channels before being
assigned to a satellite channel (Pratt and Bostian, 1986). For clarity,
this step is not shown in Fig. 14.22.
At the same time as an assignment is made, an assignment message
is stored in the assignment channel buffer, which informs the receive
stations which terrestrial channel is assigned to which satellite chan-
nel. Once an assignment is made, it is not interrupted, even during
pauses between spurts, unless the pause times are required for anoth-
er DSI channel. This reduces the amount of information needed to be
transmitted over the assignment channel.
At the receive side, the traffic messages are stored in their respec-
tive satellite-channel buffers. The assignment information ensures
that the correct buffer is read out to the corresponding terrestrial
channel during its sampling time slot. During speech pauses when the
channel has been reassigned, a low-level noise signal is introduced at
the receiver to simulate a continuous connection.
It has been assumed that a free satellite channel will be found for
any incoming speech spurt, but of course there is a finite probability
that all channels will be occupied and the speech spurt lost. Losing a
speech spurt in this manner is referred to as freeze-out, and the freeze-
out fraction is the ratio of the time the speech is lost to the average
spurt duration. It is found that a design objective of 0.5 percent for a
404
Chapter Fourteen
TLFeBOOK

freeze-out fraction is satisfactory in practice. This means that the
probability of a freeze-out occurring is 0.005.
Another source of signal mutilation is the connect clip mentioned
earlier. Again, it is found in practice that clips longer than about 50 ms
are very annoying to the listener. An acceptable design objective is to
limit the fraction of clips which are equal to or greater than 50 ms to
a maximum of 2 percent of the total clips. In other words, the proba-
bility of encountering a clip that exceeds 50 ms is 0.02.
The DSI gain is the ratio of the number of terrestrial channels to
number of satellite channels, or N/M. The DSI gain depends on the
number of satellite channels provided as well as the design objectives

stated above. Typically, DSI gains somewhat greater than 2 can be
achieved in practice.
Speech predictive encoded communications (SPEC).
The block diagram
for the SPEC system is shown in Fig. 14.23 (Sciulli and Campanella,
1973). In this method, the incoming speech signals are converted to a
PCM multiplexed signal using 8 bits per sample quantization. With 64
input lines and sampling at 125 s, the output bit rate from the mul-
tiplexer is 8  64/125  4.096 Mb/s.
The digital voice switch following the PCM multiplexer is timeshared
between the input signals. It is voice-activated to prevent transmission
of noise during silent intervals. When the zero-order predictor receives
a new sample, it compares it with the previous sample for that voice
channel, which it has stored, and transmits the new sample only if it dif-
fers from the preceding one by a predetermined amount. These new
samples are labeled unpredictable PCM samples in Fig. 14.23a.
For the 64 channels a 64-bit assignment word is also sent. A logic 1
in the channel for the assignment word means that a new sample was
sent for that channel, and a logic 0 means that the sample was
unchanged. At the receiver, the sample assignment word either directs
the new (unpredictable) sample into the correct channel slot, or it
results in the previous sample being regenerated in the reconstruction
decoder. The output from this is a 4.096-Mb/s PCM multiplexed signal
which is demultiplexed in the PCM decoder.

By removing the redundant speech samples and silent periods from
the transmission link, a doubling in channel capacity is achieved. As
shown in Fig. 14.23, the transmission is at 2.048 Mb/s for an input-out-
put rate of 4.096 Mb/s.
An advantage of the SPEC method over the DSI method is that
freeze-out does not occur during overload conditions. During overload,
sample values which should change may not. This effectively leads to
a coarser quantization and therefore an increase in quantization noise.
This is subjectively more tolerable than freeze-out.
14.7.11
Downlink analysis for digital trans-
mission
As mentioned in Sec. 14.6, the transponder power output and band-
width both impose limits on the system transmission capacity. With
TDMA, TWT backoff is not generally required, which allows the
transponder to operate at saturation. One drawback arising from this
is that the uplink station must be capable of saturating the transpon-
der, which means that even a low-traffic-capacity station requires com-
paratively large power output compared with what would be required
for FDMA. This point is considered further in Sec. 14.7.12.
As with the FDM/FDMA system analysis, it will be assumed that
the overall carrier-to-noise ratio is essentially equal to the downlink
carrier-to-noise ratio. With a power-limited system this C/N ratio is
one of the factors that determines the maximum digital rate, as shown
by Eq. (10.24). Equation (10.24) can be rewritten as
[Rb]  
	  
	
(14.29)
The [Eb/N0] ratio is determined by the required bit-error rate, as
shown in Fig. 10.17 and described in Sec. 10.6.4. For example, for a
BER of 105 an [Eb/N0] of 9.6 dB is required. If the rate Rb is specified,
then the [C/N0] ratio is determined, as shown by Eq. (14.29), and this
value is used in the link budget calculations as required by Eq. (12.53).
Alternatively, if the [C/N0] ratio is fixed by the link budget parameters
as given by Eq. (12.53), the bit rate is then determined by Eq. (14.29).
The bit rate is also constrained by the IF bandwidth. As shown in
Sec. 10.6.3, the ratio of bit rate to IF bandwidth is given by

where m  1 for BPSK and m  2 for QPSK and  is the rolloff factor.
The value of 0.2 is commonly used for the rolloff factor, and therefore,
the bit rate for a given bandwidth becomes

From Example 14.6 it will be seen that if the satellite transpon-
der has a bandwidth of 36 MHz, and an EIRP that results in a
[C/N0] of 87.3 dBHz at the receiving ground station, the system is
optimum in that the power and the bandwidth limits are reached
together.
14.7.12
Comparison of uplink power
requirements for FDMA and TDMA
With frequency-division multiple access, the modulated carriers at the
input to the satellite are retransmitted from the satellite as a com-
bined frequency-division-multiplexed signal. Each carrier retains its
modulation, which may be analog or digital. For this comparison, dig-
ital modulation will be assumed. The modulation bit rate for each car-
rier is equal to the input bit rate [adjusted as necessary for forward
error correction (FEC)]. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 14.24a,
where for simplicity, the input bit rate Rb is assumed to be the same
for each earth station. The [EIRP] is also assumed to be the same for
each earth station.
With time-division multiple access, the uplink bursts which are
displaced in time from one another are retransmitted from the satel-
lite as a combined time-division-multiplexed signal. The uplink bit
rate is equal to the downlink bit rate in this case, as illustrated in
Fig. 14.24b. As described in Sec. 14.7, compression buffers are need-
ed in order to convert the input bit rate Rb to the transmitted bit
rate RTDMA.

Because the TDMA earth stations have to transmit at a higher bit

and the FDMA uplinks, an increase in [R] requires a corresponding

ate with the same [LOSSES] and satellite [G/T], Eq. (12.39) shows
that the increase in [C/N0] can be achieved only through an increase in
the earth station [EIRP], and therefore

For small satellite business systems it is desirable to be able to oper-
ate with relatively small earth stations, which suggests that FDMA
should be the mode of operation. On the other hand, TDMA permits
more efficient use of the satellite transponder by eliminating the need
for backoff. This suggests that it might be worthwhile to operate a
hybrid system in which FDMA is the uplink mode of operation, with
the individual signals converted to a time-division-multiplexed format
in the transponder before being amplified by the TWTA. This would
allow the transponder to be operated at saturation as in TDMA. Such
a hybrid mode of operation would require the use of a signal-process-
ing transponder as discussed in the next section.
14.8
On-Board Signal Processing for
FDMA/TDM Operation
As seen in the preceding section, for small earth stations carrying dig-
ital signals at relatively low data rates, there is an advantage to be
gained in terms of earth station power requirements by using FDMA.
On the other hand, TDMA signals make more efficient use of the
transponder because back-off is not required.
Market studies show that what is termed customer premises services
(CPS) will make up a significant portion of the satellite demand over
the decade 1990–2000 (Stevenson et al., 1984). Multiplexed digital
transmission will be used, most likely at the T1 rate. This bit rate pro-
vides for most of the popular services, such as voice, data, and video-
conferencing, but specifically excludes standard television signals.
Customer premises services is an ideal candidate for the FDMA/TDM
mode of operation mentioned in the preceding section. To operate in
this mode requires the use of signal-processing transponders, in which
the FDMA uplink signals are converted to the TDM format for retrans-
mission on the downlink. It also should be noted that the use of signal-
processing transponders “decouples” the uplink from the downlink.
This is important because it allows the performance of each link to be
optimized independently of the other.
A number of signal-processing methods have been proposed. One
conventional approach is illustrated in the simplified block schematic
of Fig. 14.25a. Here the individual uplink carriers at the satellite are
selected by frequency filters and detected in the normal manner. The
baseband signals are then combined in the baseband processor, where
they are converted to a time-division-multiplexed format for remodu-
lation onto a downlink carrier. More than one downlink carrier may be
provided, but only one is shown for simplicity. The disadvantages of
the conventional approach are those of excessive size, weight, and
Satellite Access

power consumption, since the circuitry must be duplicated for each
input carrier.
The disadvantages associated with processing each carrier sepa-
rately can be avoided by means of group processing, in which the input
FDMA signals are demultiplexed as a group in a single processing cir-
cuit, illustrated in Fig. 14.25b. Feasibility studies are being conducted
into the use of digital-type group processors, although it would appear
that these may require very high speed integrated circuits (VHSICs)
not presently available. A different approach to the problem of group
processing has been proposed, which makes use of an analog device
known as a surface acoustic wave (SAW) Fourier transformer (Atzeni

et al., 1975; Hays et al., 1975; Hays and Hartmann, 1976; Maines and
Paige, 1976; Nud and Otto, 1975).
In its basic form, the surface acoustic wave device consists of two
electrodes deposited on the surface of a piezoelectric dielectric. An elec-
trical signal applied to the input electrode sets up a surface acoustic
wave which induces a corresponding signal in the output electrode. In
effect, the SAW device is a coupled circuit in which the coupling mech-
anism is the surface acoustic wave.
Because the propagation velocity of the acoustic wave is much low-
er than that of an electromagnetic wave, the SAW device exhibits use-
ful delay characteristics. In addition, the electrodes are readily shaped
to provide a wide range of useful transfer characteristics. These two
features, along with the fact that the device is small, rugged, and pas-
sive, make it a powerful signal-processing component. SAW devices
may be used conventionally as delay lines, as bandpass or bandstop fil-
ters, and they are the key component in a unit known as a Fourier
transformer.
The Fourier transformer, like any other transformer, works with
input and output signals which are functions of time. The unique prop-
erty of the Fourier transformer is that the output signal is a time ana-
log of the frequency spectrum of the input signal. When the input is a
group of FDMA carriers, the output in the ideal case would be an ana-
log of the FDMA frequency spectrum. This allows the FDMA signals to
be demultiplexed in real time by means of a commutator switch, which
eliminates the need for the separate frequency filters required in the
conventional analog approach. Once the signals have been separated
in this way, the original modulated-carrier waveforms may be recov-
ered through the use of SAW inverse Fourier transformers.
In a practical transformer, continuous operation can only be
achieved by repetitive cycling of the transformation process. As a
result, the output is periodic, and the observation interval has to be
chosen to correspond to the desired spectral interval. Also, the period-
ic interval over which transformation takes place results in a broad-
ening of the output “pulses” which represent the FDMA spectra.
Repetitive operation of the Fourier transformer at a rate equal to
the data bit rate will produce a suitable repetitive output. The relative
positions of the output pulses will remain unchanged, fixed by the fre-
quencies of the FDMA carriers. The PSK modulation on the individual
FDMA carriers appears in the phase of the carriers within each output
pulse. Thus the FDMA carriers have been converted to a pulsed TDM
signal. Further signal processing is required before this can be
retransmitted as a TDM signal.
Figure 14.26 shows the output obtained from a practical Fourier
transformer for various input signals. For Fig. 14.26a the input was
Satellite Access
413

seven continuous-wave (CW) signals applied in succession. The output
is seen to be pulses corresponding to the line spectra for these waves.
The broadening of the lines is a result of the finite time gate over
which the Fourier transformer operates. It is important to note that
the horizontal axis in Fig. 14.26 is a time axis on which the equivalent
frequency points are indicated.
Figure 14.26b shows the output obtained with three simultaneous
inputs, two CW waves and one pulsed carrier wave. Again, the output
contains two pulses corresponding to the CW signals and a time func-
tion which has the shape of the spectrum for the pulsed wave (Hays
and Hartmann, 1976). A detailed account of SAW devices will be found
in Morgan (1985) and in the IEEE Proceedings (1976).
14.9
Satellite-Switched TDMA
More efficient utilization of satellites in the geostationary orbit can be
achieved through the use of antenna spot beams. The use of spot
beams is also referred to as space-division multiplexing. Further
improvements can be realized by switching the antenna interconnec-
tions in synchronism with the TDMA frame rate, this being known as
satellite-switched TDMA (SS/TDMA).
Figure 14.27a shows in simplified form the SS/TDMA concept
(Scarcella and Abbott, 1983). Three antenna beams are used, each
beam serving two earth stations. A 3  3 satellite switch matrix is
shown. This is the key component that permits the antenna intercon-

nections to be made on a switched basis. A switch mode is a connectiv-
ity arrangement. With three beams, six modes would be required for
full interconnectivity, as shown in Fig. 14.27b, and in general with N
beams, N! modes are required for full interconnectivity. Full intercon-
nectivity means that the signals carried in each beam are transferred
to each of the other beams at some time in the switching sequence.
This includes the loopback connection, where signals are returned

along the same beam, enabling intercommunications between stations
within a beam. Of course, the uplink and downlink microwave fre-
quencies are different.
Because of beam isolation, one frequency can be used for all uplinks,
and a different frequency for all downlinks (e.g., 14 and 12 GHz in the
Ku band). To simplify the satellite switch design, the switching is car-
ried out at the intermediate frequency that is common to uplinks and
downlinks. The basic block schematic for the 3  3 system is shown in
Fig. 14.28.
A mode pattern is a repetitive sequence of satellite switch modes,
also referred to as SS/TDMA frames. Successive SS/TDMA frames
need not be identical, since there is some redundancy between modes.
For example, in Fig. 14.27b, beam A interconnects with beam B in
modes 3 and 5, and thus not all modes need be transmitted during
each SS/TDMA frame. However, for full interconnectivity, the mode
pattern must contain all modes.
All stations within a beam receive all the TDM frames transmitted
in the downlink beam. Each frame is a normal TDMA frame consist-
ing of bursts, addressed to different stations in general. As mentioned,
successive frames may originate from different transmitting stations
and therefore have different burst formats. The receiving station in a
beam recovers the bursts addressed to it in each frame.
The two basic types of switch matrix are the crossbar matrix and the
rearrangeable network. The crossbar matrix is easily configured for the
broadcast mode, in which one station transmits to all stations. The
broadcast mode with the rearrangeable network-type switch is more
complex, and this can be a deciding factor in favor of the crossbar
matrix (Watt, 1986). The schematic for a 3  3 crossbar matrix is
shown in Fig. 14.29, which also shows input beam B connected in the
broadcast mode.
The switching elements may be ferrites, diodes, or transistors. The
dual-gate FET appears to offer significant advantages over the other

types and is considered by some to be the most promising technology
(Scarcella and Abbott, 1983).
Figure 14.30 shows how a 3  3 matrix switch may be used to
reroute traffic. Each of the ground stations U, V, and W accesses a sep-
arate antenna on the satellite and carries traffic destined for the
downlink beams X, Y, and Z. The switch is controlled from a ground
control station, and the switching sequence for the frame labeled with
subscript 1 is shown in the lower part of the figure.
The schematic for a 4  4 matrix switch as used on the European
Olympus satellite is shown in Fig.14.31 (Watt, 1986). This arrange-
ment is derived from the crossbar matrix. It permits broadcast mode
operation but does not allow more than one input to be connected to
one output. Diodes are used as switching elements, and as shown,
diode quads are used which provide redundancy against diode failure.
It is clear that satellite-switched TDMA adds to the complexity of the
on-board equipment and to the synchronization requirements.
14.10
Code-Division Multiple Access
With code-division multiple access (CDMA) the individual carriers
may be present simultaneously within the same rf bandwidth, but
each carrier carries a unique code waveform (in addition to the infor-
mation signal) that allows it to be separated from all the others at the
receiver. The carrier is modulated in the normal way by the informa-
tion waveform and then is further modulated by the code waveform to

spread the spectrum over the available rf bandwidth. Many of the key
properties of CDMA rely on this spectrum spreading, and the systems
employing CDMA are also known as spread-spectrum multiple access
(SSMA). Care must be taken not to confuse the SS here with that for
satellite switched (SS/TDMA) used in the previous section.
CDMA can be used with analog and digital signals (see, for exam-
ple, Dixon, 1984), but only digital systems will be described here. For
illustration purposes, a polar NRZ waveform denoted by p(t) (see

form, and in most practical systems the chip rate is much greater
than the information bit rate. The pulses (chips) in the code wave-

form vary randomly between V and V. The randomness is an
essential feature of spread-spectrum systems, and more will be said
about this shortly. The code signal may be applied as modulation in
exactly the same way as the information signal so that the BPSK sig-
nal carries both the information signal p(t) and the code signal c(t).
This method is referred to as direct-sequence spread spectrum
(DS/SS). Other techniques are also used to spread the spectrum, such
as frequency hopping, but the discussion here will be limited to the
DS/SS method.
14.10.1
Direct-sequence spread spectrum
In Fig.14.33, p(t) is an NRZ binary information signal, and c(t) is a
NRZ binary code signal. These two signals form the inputs to a multi-
plier (balanced modulator), the output of which is proportional to the
product p(t)c(t). This product signal is applied to a second balanced
modulator, the output of which is a BPSK signal at the carrier fre-

quency. For clarity, it is assumed that the carrier is the uplink fre-
quency, and hence the uplink carrier is described by

The corresponding downlink carrier is
eD(t)  c(t)p(t) cos

(14.34)
At the receiver, an identical c(t) generator is synchronized to the c(t)
of the downlink carrier. This synchronization is carried out in the
acquisition and tracking block. With c(t) a polar NRZ type waveform,
and with the locally generated c(t) exactly in synchronism with the
transmitted c(t), the product c2(t)  1. Thus the output from the mul-
tiplier is
c(t) eD(t)  c 2(t)p(t) cos

(14.35)
This is identical to the conventional BPSK signal given by Eq.(10.14),
and hence detection proceeds in the normal manner.
14.10.2
The code signal c(t)
The code signal c(t) carries a binary code that has special properties
needed for successful implementation of CDMA. The binary symbols
used in the codes are referred to as chips rather than bits to avoid con-
fusion with the information bits that also will be present. Chip gener-
ation is controlled by a clock, and the chip rate, in chips per second, is
given by the clock speed. Denoting the clock speed by Rch, the chip peri-
od is the reciprocal of the clock speed:
Tch 
(14.36)
The waveform c(t) is periodic, in that each period is a repetition of a
given sequence of N chips. The sequence itself exhibits random prop-
erties, which will be described shortly. The periodic time for the wave-
form is
TN  NTch
(14.37)
The codes are generated using binary shift registers and associated
linear logic circuits. The circuit for a three-stage shift register that
generates a sequence of N  7 chips is shown in Fig.14.34a. Feedback
occurs from stages 1 and 3 as inputs to the exclusive OR gate. This pro-

vides the input to the shift register, and the chips are clocked through
at the clock rate Rch. The generator starts with all stages holding bina-
ry 1s, and the following states are as shown in the table in Fig. 14.34.
Stage 3 also provides the binary output sequence. The code waveform
generated from this code is shown in Fig. 14.34b.
Such codes are known as maximal sequence or m-sequence codes
because they utilize the maximum length sequence that can be gener-
ated. For Fig. 14.34a the maximum length sequence is 7 chips as shown.
In general, the shift register passes through all states (all combinations
of 1s and 0s in the register) except the all-zero state when generating a
maximal sequence code. Therefore, a code generator employing an n-
stage shift register can generate a maximum sequence of N chips, where
N  2n  1
(14.38)
The binary 1s and 0s are randomly distributed such that the code
exhibits noiselike properties. However, there are certain deterministic
features described below, and the codes are more generally known as
PN codes, which stands for pseudo-noise codes.

(14.40)
The importance of this relationship is that when the code uses V
volts for a binary 1 and V volts for a binary 0, the dc offset is close
to zero. Since there is always one more positive chip than negative,
the dc offset will be given by
dc offset 
(14.41)
The dc offset determines the carrier level relative to the peak val-
ue; that is, the carrier is suppressed by amount 1/N for BPSK. For
example, using a code with n  8 with BPSK modulation, the car-
rier will be suppressed by 1/255 or 48 dB.

N [N is given by Eq. (14.38)]. Two numbers are relatively prime
when their greatest common divisor is 1. A general formula for find-

The autocorrelation function for
c(t)
One of the most important properties of c(t) is its autocorrelation func-
tion. The autocorrelation function is a measure of how well a time-shift-
ed version of the waveform compares with the unshifted version. Figure
14.35a shows how the comparison may be made. The c(t) waveform is
multiplied with a shifted version of itself, c(t  ), and the output is
averaged (shown by the integrator). The average, of course, is indepen-
dent of time t (the integrator integrates out the time-t dependence), but
it will depend on the time lead or lag introduced by . When the wave-
forms are coincident,   0, and the average output is a maximum,
which for convenience will be normalized to 1. Any shift in time,
advance or delay, away from the   0 position will result in a decrease
in output voltage. A property of m-sequence code waveforms is that the
autocorrelation function decreases linearly from the maximum value
(unity in this case) to a negative level 1/N, as shown in Fig. 14.35b. The
very pronounced peak in the autocorrelation function provides the chief
means for acquiring acquisition and tracking so that the locally gener-
ated m-sequence code can be synchronized with the transmitted version.

Acquisition and tracking
One form of acquisition circuit that makes use of the autocorrela-
tion function is shown in Fig. 14.36. The output from the first mul-
tiplier is
e(t)  c(t  !) c(t) p(t) cos 
Dt
 c(t  !) c(t) cos [
Dt  (t) ]
(14.44)
Here, the information modulation, which is BPSK, is shown as (t) so
that the effect of the following bandpass filter (BPF) on the amplitude
can be more clearly seen. The BPF has a passband centered on 
D,
wide with respect to the information modulation but narrow with
respect to the code signal. It performs the amplitude-averaging func-
tion on the code signal product (see Maral and Bousquet, 1998). The
averaging process can be illustrated as follows. Consider the product
of two cosine terms and its expansion:
cos 
t cos (
t  ) 
{ cos [
t  (
t  ) ]  cos [
t  (
t  ) ] }

[cos (2
t  )  cos () ]
(14.45)
The BPF will reject the high-frequency component, leaving only the
average component 12 cos(). This signal may be considered analogous
to the c(t)c(t  !) term in Eq. (14.44). The envelope detector following
the BPF produces an output proportional to the envelope of the signal,
that is, to the average value of c(t)c(t  !). This is a direct measure of
the autocorrelation function. When it is less than the predetermined
threshold VT required for synchronism, the time shift ! incremented.

Once the threshold has been reached or exceeded, the system switch-
es from acquisition mode to tracking mode.
One form of tracking circuit, the delay lock loop, is shown in Fig.
14.37. Here, two correlators are used, but the local signal to one is
advanced by half a chip period relative to the desired code waveform,
and the other is delayed by the same amount. The outputs from the
correlators are subtracted, and this difference signal provides the con-
trol voltage for the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that drives the
shift register clock. With the control voltage at the zero crossover
point, the locally generated code signal is in phase with the received
code signal. Any tendency to drift out of phase changes the VCO in
such a way as to bring the control voltage back to the zero crossover
point, thus maintaining synchronism.
The acquisition and tracking circuits also will attempt to correlate
the stored version of c(t) at the receiver with all the other waveforms
being received. Such correlations are termed cross-correlations. It is
essential that the cross-correlation function not show a similar peak as

the autocorrelation, and this requires careful selection of the spread-
ing functions used in the overall system (see, for example, Dixon,
1984).
14.10.4
Spectrum spreading and despread-
ing
In Sec. 10.6.3 the idea of bandwidth for PSK modulation was intro-
duced. In general, for a BPSK signal at a bit rate Rb, the main lobe of
the power-density spectrum occupies a bandwidth extending from fc 
Rb to fc  Rb. This is sketched in Fig. 14.38a. A similar result applies
when the modulation signal is c(t), the power density spectrum being
as sketched in Fig. 14.38b. It should be mentioned here that because
c(t) exhibits periodicity, the spectrum density will be a line function,
and Fig. 14.38b shows the envelope of the spectrum. The spectrum
shows the power density (watts per hertz) in the signal. For constant
carrier power, it follows that if a signal is forced to occupy a wider
bandwidth, its spectrum density will be reduced. This is a key result
in CDMA systems. In all direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems,
the chip rate is very much greater than the information bit rate, or Rch
% Rb. The bandwidth is determined mainly by Rch so that the power
density of the signal described by Eq. (14.34) is spread over the band-
width determined by Rch. The power density will be reduced approxi-
mately in the ratio of Rch to Rb.
Assuming then that acquisition and tracking have been accom-
plished, c(t) in the receiver (Fig. 14.33) performs in effect a despread-
ing function in that it restores the spectrum of the wanted signal to
what it was before the spreading operation in the transmitter. This is

also how the spread-spectrum technique can reduce interference.
Figure 14.39a shows the spectra of two signals, an interfering signal
that is not part of the CDMA system and that has not been spread, and
the desired DS/SS received signal. Following the despreading opera-
tion for the desired signal, its spectrum is restored as described previ-
ously. The interfering signal, however, is simply multiplied by the c(t)
signal, which results in it being spread.
14.10.5
CDMA throughput
The maximum number of channels in a CDMA system can be estimated
as follows: It is assumed that the thermal noise is negligible compared
with the noise resulting from the overlapping channels, and also for com-
parison purposes, it will be assumed that each channel introduces equal
power PR into the receiver. For a total of K channels, K  1 of these will
produce noise, and assuming that this is evenly spread over the noise
bandwidth BN of the receiver, the noise density, in watts per hertz, is

TDMA (see Example 14.4), where it is seen that the throughput effi-
ciency can exceed 90 percent.
CDMA offers several advantages for satellite networking, especially
where VSAT-type terminals are involved. These are
1. The beamwidth for VSAT antennas is comparatively broad and
therefore could be subject to interference from adjacent satellites.
The interference rejection properties of CDMA through spreading
are of considerable help here.
2. Multipath interference, for example, that resulting from reflections,
can be avoided provided the time delay of the reflected signal is
greater than a chip period and the receiver locks onto the direct
wave.
3. Synchronization between stations in the system is not required
(unlike TDMA, where synchronization is a critical feature of the sys-
tem). This means that a station can access the system at any time.
4. Degradation of the system (reduction in Eb/No) is gradual with an
increase in number of users. Thus additional traffic could be
accommodated if some reduction in performance was acceptable.
The main disadvantage is the low throughput efficiency.

Satellite Services and the Internet
15.1
Introduction
On October 24, 1995, the Federal Networking Council (FNC) in the
United States passed a resolution defining the Internet as a global
information system that
(I)
is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based
on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons;
(II)
is able to support communications using the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent exten-
sions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and
(III) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high
level services layered on the communications and related infra-
structure described herein.
This formal description of the Internet summarizes what in fact was
many years of evolutionary growth and change (see Leiner et al.,
2000). The key elements in this definition are the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), both of which are
described shortly. These protocols are usually lumped together as
TCP/IP and are embedded in the software for operating systems and
browsers such as Windows and Netscape.
The Internet does not have its own physical structure. It makes use
of existing physical plant, the copper wires, optical fibers, satellite
links, etc. owned by companies such as AT&T, MCI, Sprint, etc.
Although there is no identifiable structure, access to the Internet fol-
lows well-defined rules. Users connect to Internet service providers
(ISPs), who in turn connect to network service providers (NSPs), who
complete the connections to other users and to servers. Servers are

computers dedicated to the purpose of providing information to the
Internet. They run specialized software for each type of Internet appli-
cation. These include email, discussion groups, long-distance comput-
ing, and file transfers (Corbett, undated; Sterling, 1993). Routers are
computers that form part of the communications net and that route or
direct the data along the best available paths in the network.
Although there is no central management or authority for the
Internet, its extraordinarily rapid growth has meant that some control
has to be exercised over what is permitted. A summary of the control-
ling groups is shown in Fig. 15.1a. A description of the groups will be
found in Leiner et al. (2000) and Mackenzie (1998).
The World Wide Web (WWW) is probably the most widely used
application on the Internet. The evolution and growth of the WWW
has been rather similar to that of the Internet itself, with no central
authority but still with a structure that attempts to regulate what
happens. The World Wide Web Consortium, referred to as W3C, was
founded in October 1994 (Jacobs, 2000). W3C oversees a number of
special interest groups, as shown in Fig. 15.1b, and coordinates its
efforts with the IETF and with other standards bodies. Details of the
W3C will be found in Jacobs (2000).
15.2
Network Layers
The uplink and downlink between satellite and earth stations form
what is known as the physical layer in a data communication system.
By data communications is meant communications between computers
and peripheral equipment. The signals are digital, and although digital
signals are covered in Chap. 10, the satellite links must be able to
accommodate the special requirements imposed by networks. The ter-
minology used in networks is highly specialized, and some of these
terms are explained here to provide the background needed to under-
stand the satellite aspects. The Internet, of course, is a data communi-
cation system (although there is presently a move to incorporate voice
communications along with data in what is known as voice over Internet
Protocol, or VoIP).
The data are transmitted in packets. Many separate functions have
to be performed in packet transmission, such as packet addressing,
routing, and coping with packet congestion. The modern approach is
to assign each function to a layer in what is termed the network
architecture. The layers are conceptual in the sense that they may
consist of software or some combination of software and hardware. In
the case of the Internet, the network architecture is referred to the
TCP/IP model, although there are protocols other than TCP/IP con-

brief description of these layers is included to familiarize the reader
with some of the terms used in network communications, although
the TCP layer is of most interest in this chapter.

I Data-link layer. The function of this layer is to organize the digital
data into blocks as required by the physical layer. For example, if the
physical layer uses Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology,
the data are organized into cells. Digital transmission by satellite
frequently uses TDMA, as described in Chap. 14, and satellite sys-
tems are being developed which transmit Internet data over ATM.
Thus the data-link layer has to organize the data into a suitable for-
mat to suit the physical layer technology. In the terrestrial Internet,
the data link converts the data into frames. The data-link layer and
the physical layer are closely interrelated, and it can be difficult
sometimes to identify the interface between these two layers
(Mackenzie, 1998).
I Network layer. This is strictly an Internet Protocol (IP) layer. The
packets are passed along the Internet from router to router and to
the host stations. No exact path is laid out beforehand, and the IP
layers in the routers must provide the destination address for the
next leg of the journey so to speak. This destination address is
part of the IP header attached to the packet. The source address
is also included as part of the IP header. The problems of lost
packets or packets arriving out of sequence are not a concern of
the IP layer, and for this reason, the IP layer is called connection-
less (i.e., it does not require a connection to be established before
sending a packet on). These problems are taken care of by the
transport layer.
I Transport layer. Two sets of protocol are provided in this layer. With
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), information is passed back
and forth between transport layers, which controls the information
flow. This includes such functions as the correct sequencing of pack-
ets, replacement of lost packets, and adjusting the transmission rate
of packets to prevent congestion. In the early days of the Internet
when traffic was comparatively light, these problems could be han-
dled even where satellite transmissions were involved. With the
enormous increase in traffic on the present-day Internet, these prob-

lems require special solutions where satellite systems are used,
which are discussed in later sections. The TCP layer is termed con-
nection-oriented (compared with the connectionless service men-
tioned above) because sender and receiver must be in
communication with each other to implement the protocol. There are
situations where a simple standalone message may need to be sent
which does not require the more complex TCP. For these types of
message, another transport layer protocol called the User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) is used. The UDP provides a connectionless service,
similar to IP. The UDP header adds the port numbers for the source
and destination applications.
The term packet has been used somewhat loosely up to this point. A
more precise terminology is used for packets at the various layers, and
this is shown in Fig. 15.3. At the application level the packet is simply
referred to as data. The packet comprising the TCP header, and the
data are a TCP segment. The packet comprising the UDP header and
the data is a UDP message. The packet comprising the IP header, the
TCP or UDP header, and the data is an IP datagram. Finally, the pack-
et comprising the data-link frame header, the frame trailer (used for
error control), and the IP datagram is a frame.
It should be noted here that the preceding definitions are those used
in version 4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv4). Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6) is a more recent version being brought on-stream in which the
IP datagram is in fact called an IP packet.

of 8 bits, and this practice will be followed here. It should be noted,
however, that in computer terminology, a byte can mean a unit other
than 8 bits, and the 8-bit unit may be called an octet.

description of these protocols will be found in Feit (1997). The present
text will be concerned more with the special enhancements needed on
TCP/IP for successful satellite transmission.
15.3
The TCP Link
A virtual communications link exists between corresponding layers in
a network. The header in the TCP segment (see Fig. 15.3) carries
instructions that enable communication between the send and receive
TCP layers. Of course, the communication has to pass through the other
layers and along the physical link, but only the TCP layers act on the
Transmission Control Protocols (TCPs) contained in the segment
header. There is no direct physical link between the TCP layers, and
for this reason, it is called a virtual link.
The send and receive TCP layers have buffer memories (usually just
called buffers). The receive buffer holds incoming data while they are
being processed. The send buffer holds data until they are ready for

transmission. It also holds copies of data already sent until it receives
an acknowledgment that the original has been received correctly. The
receive window is the amount of receive buffer space available at any
given time. This changes as the received data are processed and
removed from the buffer. The receive TCP layer sends an acknowledg-
ment (ACK) signal to the send TCP layer when it has cleared data
from its buffer, and the ACK signal also provides an update on the cur-
rent size of the receive window.
The send TCP layer keeps track of the amount of data in transit and
therefore unacknowledged. It can calculate the amount of receive
buffer space remaining, allowing for the data in transit. This remain-
ing buffer space represents the amount of data that can still be sent
and is termed the send window. The send TCP layer also sets a timeout
period, and failure to receive an ACK signal within this period results
in a duplicate packet being sent. On terrestrial networks, the probabil-
ity of bit error (see Chap. 10) is extremely low, and congestion is the
most likely reason for loss of ACK signals. Because a network carries
traffic from many sources, traffic congestion can occur. The IP layer of
the TCP/IP discards packets when congestion occurs, and hence the
corresponding ACK signals from the TCP layer do not get sent. Rather
than continually resending packets, the send station reduces its rate of
transmission, this being known as congestion control. A congestion win-
dow is applied, which starts at a size of one segment for a new connec-
tion. The window is doubled in size for each ACK received until it
reaches a maximum value determined by the number of failed ACKs
experienced. For normal operation, the congestion window grows in
size to equal the receive window. The congestion window increases
slowly at first, but as each doubling takes effect, the size increases
exponentially. This controlling mechanism is known as slow start. If
congestion sets in, this will be evidenced by an increase in the failure
to receive ACKs, and the send TCP will revert to the slow start.
15.4
Satellite Links and TCP
Although satellite links have formed part of the Internet from its begin-
ning, the rapid expansion of the Internet and the need to introduce con-
gestion control have highlighted certain performance limitations
imposed by the satellite links. Before discussing these, it should be
pointed out that the increasing demand for Internet services may well
be met best with satellite direct-to-home links, and many companies
are actively engaged in setting up just such systems (see Sec. 15.6).
In the ideal case, the virtual link between TCP layers should not be
affected by the physical link, and certainly the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) is so well established that it would be undesirable
Satellite Services and the Internet
443
TLFeBOOK

(some would say unacceptable) to modify it to accommodate peculiari-
ties of the physical link. The factors that can adversely affect TCP per-
formance over satellite links are as follows:
Bit error rate (BER).
Satellite links have a higher bit error rate (BER;
see Chap. 10) than the terrestrial links forming the Internet. Typically,
the satellite link BER without error control coding is around 106,
whereas a level of 108 or lower is needed for successful TCP transfer
(Chotikapong and Sun, 2000). The comparatively low BER on terres-
trial links means that most packet losses are the result of congestion,
and the TCP send layer is programmed to act on this assumption.
When packets are lost as a result of high BER, therefore, as they might
on satellite links, the TCP layer assumes that congestion is at fault
and automatically invokes the congestion control measures. This slows
the throughput.
Round-trip time (RTT).
The round-trip time (RTT) of interest here is
the time interval that elapses between sending a TCP segment and
receiving its ACK. With geostationary (GEO) satellites, the round-trip
propagation path is ground station to satellite to ground station and
back again. The range from ground station to the satellite (see Chap.
3) is on the order of 40,000 km, and therefore, the propagation path for
the round trip is 4  40,000  160,000 km. The propagation delay is
therefore 160,000/3  108  0.532 s. This is just the space propagation
delay. The total round-trip time must take into account the propaga-
tion delays on the terrestrial circuits and the delays resulting from sig-
nal processing. For order of magnitude calculations, an RTT value of
0.55 s would be appropriate. The send TCP layer must wait this length
of time to receive the ACKs, and of course, it cannot send new seg-
ments until the ACKs are received, which is going to slow the through-
put. The send TCP timeout period is also based on the RTT, and this
will be unduly lengthened. Also, with interactive applications such as
Telnet, this delay is highly undesirable.
Bandwidth-delay product (BDP).
The RTT is also used in determining an
important factor known as the bandwidth delay product (BDP). The
delay part of this refers to the RTT, since a sender has to wait this
amount of time for the ACK before sending more data. The bandwidth
refers to the channel bandwidth. As shown in Chaps. 10 and 12, band-
width and bit rate are directly related. In network terminology, the
bandwidth is usually specified in bytes per second (or multiples of this),
where it is understood that 1 byte is equal to 8 bits. For example, a satel-
lite bandwidth of 36 MHz carrying a BPSK signal could handle a bit
rate given by Eq. (14.30) as 30 megabits per second (Mb/s). This is equiv-
444
Chapter Fifteen
TLFeBOOK

alent to 3.75  106 bytes per second (B/s) or about 3662 kilobytes per
second (kB/s). If the sender transmits at this rate, the largest packet it
can send within the RTT of 0.55 s is 3662  0.55  2014 kilobytes
approximately. This is the BDP for the two-way satellite channel. The
channel is sometimes referred to as a pipeline, and one that has a high
BDP, as a long fat pipe. Now the receive TCP layer uses a 16-bit word to
notify the send TCP layer of the size of the receive window it is going to
use. Allowing 1 byte for certain overheads, the biggest segment size that
can be declared for the receive window is 216  1  65,535 bytes, or
approximately 64 kilobytes. (Recall that 1 kilobyte is equal to 1024
bytes.) This falls well short of the 2014 kilobytes set by the BDP for the
channel, and thus the channel is very underutilized.
Variable round-trip time.
Where lower earth orbiting satellites are used
such as those in low earth orbits (LEOs) and medium earth orbits
(MEOs), the propagation delays will be much less than that for the
GEO. The slant range to LEOs is typically on the order of a few thou-
sand kilometers at most, and for MEOs, a few tens of thousand kilo-
meters. The problem with these orbits is not so much the absolute
value of delay as the variability. Because these satellites are not geo-
stationary, the slant range varies, and for continuous communications
there is the need for intersatellite links, which also adds to the delay
and the variability. For example, for LEOs, the delay can vary from a
few to about 80 ms. Whether or not this will have an impact on TCP
performance is currently an open question (RFC-2488).
15.5
Enhancing TCP Over Satellite
Channels Using Standard Mechanisms 
(RFC-2488)
In keeping with the objective that, where possible, the TCP itself
should not be modified to accommodate satellite links, the Request for
Comments 2488 (RFC-2488) describes in detail several ways in which
the performance over satellite links can be improved. These are sum-
marized in Table 15.1. The first two mechanisms listed do not require
any changes to the TCP. The others do require extensions to the TCP.
As always, any extensions to the TCP must maintain compatibility
with networks that do not employ the extensions. Brief descriptions of
the mechanisms are included, but the reader is referred to the
Requests for Comments (RFCs) for full details (see Sec. 15.6).
MTU stands for maximum transmission unit, and Path MTU-
Discovery is a method that allows the sender to find the largest packet
and hence largest TCP segment size that can be sent without frag-
mentation. The congestion window is incremented in segments; hence
Satellite Services and the Internet
445
TLFeBOOK

larger segments allow the congestion window to increment faster in
terms of number of bytes carried. There is a delay involved in imple-
menting Path MTU-Discovery, and of course, there is the added com-
plexity. Overall, however, it improves the performance of TCP over
satellite links.
Forward error correction (FEC).
Lost packets, whether from transmis-
sion errors or congestion, are assumed by the TCP to happen as a
result of congestion, which means that congestion control is imple-
mented, with its resulting reduction in throughput. Although there is
ongoing research into ways of identifying the mechanisms for packet
loss, the problem still remains. Application of FEC (as described in
Chap. 11) therefore should be used where possible.
Slow start and congestion avoidance.
These strategies have already
been described in Sec. 15.3, along with the problems introduced by
long RTTs. Slow start and congestion avoidance control the number of
segments transmitted, but not the size of the segments. Using Path
MTU-Discovery as described earlier can increase the size, and hence
the data throughput is improved.
Fast retransmit and fast recovery.
From the nature of the ACKs
received, the fast retransmit algorithm enables the sender to identify
and resend a lost segment before its timeout expires. Since the data
flow is not interrupted by timeouts, the sender can infer that conges-
tion is not a problem, and the fast recovery algorithm prevents the con-
gestion window from reverting to slow start. The fast retransmit
algorithm can only respond to one lost segment per send window. If
there is more than one, the others trigger the slow start mechanism.

TCP large windows.
As shown in Sec. 15.4 in connection with the band-
width delay product, the receive window size is limited by the address
field to 64 kilobytes maximum. By introducing a window scale exten-
sion into the TCP header, the address field can be effectively increased
to 32 bits. Allowing for certain overheads, the maximum window size
that can be declared is 230  1 gigabyte (again keeping in mind that 1
gigabyte  10243 bytes). The window size and hence the scale factor
can be set locally by the receive TCP layer. Note, however, that the TCP
extension has to be implemented at the sender and the receiver.
The two mechanisms PAWS, which stands for protection against
wrapped sequence, and RTTM, which stands for round-trip time mea-
surement, are extensions that should be used with large windows.
Maintaining steady traffic flow and avoiding congestion require a cur-
rent knowledge of the RTT, which can be difficult to obtain with large
windows. By including a time stamp in the TCP header, the RTT can
be measured. Another problem that arises with large windows is that
the numbering of old sequences can overlap with new, a condition
known as wrap-around. The protection against wrapped sequences is
an algorithm that also makes use of the time stamp. These algorithms
are described fully in RFC-1323.
SACK stands for selective acknowledgment and is a strategy that
enables the receiver to inform the sender of all segments received suc-
cessfully. The sender then need only resend the missing segments.
The strategy should be used where multiple segments may be lost
during transmission, such as, for example, in a satellite link, since
clearly, retransmission of duplicate segments over long delay paths
would seriously reduce the throughput. Full details of SACK will be
found in RFC-2018.

Requests for Comments
The rapid growth of the Internet resulted in large part from the free
and open access to documentation provided by network researchers.
The ideas and proposals of researchers are circulated in memos called
Requests for Comments (RFCs). They can be accessed on the World
Wide Web at a number of sites, for example, http://www.rfc-
editor.org/. Below is a summary of some of the RFCs that relate specif-
ically to satellite links and that have been referred to in Sec. 15.5
I RFC-2760, Ongoing TCP Research Related to Satellites, February
2000. Abstract: This document outlines possible TCP enhancements
that may allow TCP to better utilize the available bandwidth pro-
vided by networks containing satellite links. The algorithms and
mechanisms outlined have not been judged to be mature enough to
Satellite Services and the Internet
447
TLFeBOOK

be recommended by the IETF. The goal of this document is to edu-
cate researchers as to the current work and progress being done in
TCP research related to satellite networks.
I RFC-2488, Enhancing TCP Over Satellite Channels Using Standard
Mechanisms, January 1999. Abstract: The Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) provides reliable delivery of data across any network
path, including network paths containing satellite channels. While
TCP works over satellite channels, there are several IETF stan-
dardized mechanisms that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the
available capacity of the network path. This document outlines some
of these TCP mitigations. At this time, all mitigations discussed in
this document are IETF standards track mechanisms (or are com-
pliant with IETF standards).
I RFC-2018, TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options, October 1996.
Abstract: TCP may experience poor performance when multiple
packets are lost from one window of data. With the limited informa-
tion available from cumulative acknowledgments, a TCP sender can
only learn about a single lost packet per round-trip time. An aggres-
sive sender could choose to retransmit packets early, but such
retransmitted segments may have already been received successfully.
A selective acknowledgment (SACK) mechanism, combined with a
selective repeat retransmission policy, can help to overcome these lim-
itations. The receiving TCP sends back SACK packets to the sender
informing the sender of data that have been received. The sender can
then retransmit only the missing data segments. This memo propos-
es an implementation of SACK and discusses its performance and
related issues.
I RFC-1323, TCP Extensions for High Performance, May 1992.
Abstract: This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve
performance over large bandwidth*delay product paths and to pro-
vide reliable operation over very high-speed paths. It defines new
TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps, which are designed
to provide compatible interworking with TCPs that do not imple-
ment the extensions. The timestamps are used for two distinct
mechanisms: RTTM (round-trip time measurement) and PAWS (pro-
tect against wrapped sequences). Selective acknowledgments are not
included in this memo. This memo combines and supersedes RFC-
1072 and RFC-1185, adding additional clarification and more
detailed specification. Appendix C of RFC-1323 summarizes the
changes from the earlier RFCs.
I RFC-1072, TCP Extensions for Long Delay Paths, October 1988.
Status of this memo: This memo proposes a set of extensions to the
TCP to provide efficient operation over a path with a high band-
448

TLFeBOOK

width*delay product. These extensions are not proposed as an
Internet standard at this time. Instead, they are intended as a basis
for further experimentation and research on TCP performance.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
15.7
Split TCP Connections
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides end-to-end connec-
tion. By this is meant that the TCP layers at the sender and receiver
are connected through a virtual link (see Sec. 15.3) so that such mat-
ters as congestion control, regulation of data flow, etc. can be carried
out without intervention of intermediate stages. It is to preserve this
end-to-end connection that many of the extensions to TCP described in
the preceding section have been introduced.
If, however, it is assumed that the end-to-end connectivity can be
split, new possibilities are opened up for the introduction of satellite
links as part of the overall Internet. Figure 15.5 shows one possible
arrangement (Ghani and Dixit, 1999). Breaking the network in this
way is termed spoofing. This refers to the fact that the TCP source
thinks it is connected to the TCP destination, whereas the interwork-
ing unit (IWU) performs a protocol conversion. In Fig. 15.5, TCP Reno
refers to the TCP with extensions: slow start, congestion avoidance,
fast retransmit, fast recovery, support for large windows, and delayed
ACKs. At the IWU the data are transferred from the TCP Reno to the

data-link protocol. As shown in the figure, any one of a number of link
layer protocols may be used. At the destination end, the IWU performs
the conversion back to TCP Reno.
One approach developed at Roke Manor Research, Ltd. (West and
McCann, 2000) illustrates some of the possibilities and problems asso-
ciated with splitting. The two key issues are setup and teardown (West
and McCann, 2000). To illustrate the process, consider a connection
being set up between host A and host B. In setting up the connection,
host A sends a synchronizing segment, labeled SYN in the TCP/IP
scheme, which specifies certain protocols to be followed. Host B
responds with its own SYN, which contains its protocol requirements,
also an ACK signal that carries the number to be used by host A for
the first data byte it sends. Host A then responds with an ACK signal
that carries the number to be used by host B for the first data byte it
sends. The three signals, SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK, constitute what is
known as a three-way handshake.
A three-way handshake is also used to close (teardown). Suppose
host B wishes to close. It sends a final segment (FIN). Host A acknowl-
edges the FIN with an ACK and follows this with its own final segment
(FIN). Host B acknowledges the FIN with an ACK. On connections
with long RTTs, it will be seen that these three-way handshakes will
be very time-consuming.
Figure 15.6 shows the system developed at Roke Manor. The
enhancers perform the same function as the IWUs in Fig. 15.5 in that
they terminate the Internet connections and do not require any modi-
fications to the TCP/IP. A propriety protocol is used over the satellite
link. Figure 15.7 illustrates a situation where both setup and tear-
down are spoofed. In this illustration, host B refuses the connection,
but host A receives the RESET signal too late. The spoofed FIN ACK
tells host A that the data transfer was successful.
Figure 15.8 shows a more appropriate strategy. In this case, the FIN
sent by host A is not spoofed. Since host B has refused the connection,
host A receives no FIN, ACK back from host B. Therefore, host A can

infer from this that there was an error. While this is not as good as a
regular TCP/IP connection, which would have reported a failure to
connect on the first SYN, the system does adjust to the error and
removes the spoofing on the setup on a second try.
15.8
Asymmetric Channels
The term asymmetry applies in two senses to an Internet connection.
It can refer to the data flow, which is often asymmetric in nature. A
short request being sent for a Web page and the returned Web page
may be a much larger document. Also, the acknowledgment packets
sent on the return or reverse link are generally shorter than the
TCP segments sent on the forward link. Values of 1500 bytes for

data segments on the forward link and 40 bytes for ACKs on the
reverse link are given in RFC-2760.
Asymmetry is also used to describe the physical capacities of the
links. For small earth stations (e.g., VSATs), transmit power and
antenna size (in effect, the EIRP) limit the uplink data rate, which
therefore may be much less than the downlink data rate. Such asym-
metry can result in ACK congestion. Again, using some values given in
RFC-2760, for a 1.5 Mb/s data link a reverse link of less than 20 kb/s
can result in ACK congestion. The levels of asymmetry that lead to
ACK congestion are readily encountered in VSAT networks that share
the uplink through multiple access.
In some situations, the reverse link may be completed through a ter-
restrial circuit, as shown in Fig. 15.9 (Ghani and Dixit, 1999). Here,
the TCP source is connected to the satellite uplink through an IWU as
before. The downlink signal feeds the small residential receiver, which
is a receive-only earth station. An IWU on the receive side converts the
data to the TCP format and sends them on to the destination. The ACK
packets from the TCP destination are returned to the TCP source
through a terrestrial network. As pointed out in RFC-2760, the reverse
link capacity is limited not only by its bandwidth but also by queue
lengths at routers, which again can result in ACK congestion. Some of
the proposed methods of handling asymmetry problems and ongoing
research are described in Ghani and Dixit (1999).
DirecPC (http://www.direcpc.com/), a product and service of
Hughes Network Systems, takes advantage of asymmetric channels
to provide satellite transfer of Internet data to the individual con-
sumer and homeowner. The system as shown in Fig. 15.10 can be used
for all TCP/IP-based software applications such as email, Telnet, and
the World Wide Web (WWW). A customer URL (uniform, or universal
resource locator) request goes out through a modem to the Internet
service provider (ISP) at normal modem speeds (typically in the range
28.6 to 56 kb/s). Before sending the URL, the DirecPC software
installed in the customer’s PC attaches what is termed a tunneling
code to the URL. This instructs the ISP to forward the request to the
DirecPC network operations center (NOC) instead of to the Internet
server. At the NOC, the tunneling code is stripped away, and the
request is forwarded to the Internet site through high-speed lines.
The requested content is returned to the NOC, which then downloads
it to the customer through the satellite link, at a bit rate of up to 400
kb/s. The advantage of the system, therefore, is that the large data
files are returned over a high-speed link rather than back through the
low-speed modem.
Hughes 601 spacecraft are used, and the downlink is in the Ka band
(20 to 30 GHz). The company offers a variety of system configurations,

Proposed Systems
Most of the currently employed satellites operate in what is called a
“bent pipe” mode; that is, they relay the data from one host to another
without any onboard processing. Also, many of the problems with using
geostationary satellites for Internet traffic arise because of the long
propagation delay and the resulting high delay-bandwidth product. In
some of the newer satellite systems, use is made of low and medium
earth orbiting satellites to cut down on the propagation delay time. Also,
onboard signal processing is used in many instances that may result in
the TCP/IP protocol being exchanged for propriety protocols over the
satellite links. The satellite part of the network may carry the Internet
Protocol (IP) over what is known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM). With ATM, the data are partitioned into fixed-length packets,
called cells, of length 53 bytes total. Five bytes form the header for the
cell, and the remaining 48 bytes are the payload. However, with ATM,
the “payload” also carries additional overhead bytes, specifically bytes
for what is called the ATM adaptation layer. The asynchronous part of
the ATM refers to the fact that cells are transmitted asynchronously;
that is, they do not need to be assigned regular time slots. The cell size
of 53 bytes is a compromise between what is suitable for time-sensitive
traffic such as voice and video and what is suitable for non-time-
sensitive data. For high-bit-rate traffic, many cells can be trans-

mitted in sequence, and traffic bursts also can be handled in this
way. This is sometimes referred to as bandwidth on demand. Note
that synchronous digital signals may be carried in the cells, even
though the system is referred to as asynchronous. A good introduc-
tion to ATM networking is provided in Goralski (1995), and TCP/IP
over satellite ATM networks is described in Goyal et al. (1999).
The Ka band, which covers from 27 to 40 GHz, is used in many (but
not all) of these newer systems. Wider bandwidths are available for
carriers in the Ka band compared with those in the Ku band. A survey
of some of these broadband systems will be found in Farserotu and
Prasad (2000). A summary is provided in the following paragraphs.
Astrolink.
The Astrolink system is scheduled to be operational in
2003. It will begin service with four geostationary satellites, and this
number will be expanded to nine as the need arises. The nine satellites
are to be distributed among the five orbital positions: 97°W for the
Americas; 21.5°W for Europe, the Americas, and Africa; 130°E for East
Asia and Australia; 2°E for Europe, Africa, and West Asia; and 175°E
for Oceania. Uplink frequencies are in the ranges 28.35 to 28.8 GHz
and 29.25 to 30.0 GHz, and downlink frequencies are in the range 19.7
to 20.2 GHz (Farserotu and Prasad, 2000). Each satellite operates 44
spot beams, and onboard switching will be provided. An extensive
ground segment is envisioned, having four regional network control
centers for the day-to-day running of the network and a master net-
work control center that will supervise and control the overall system.
In addition to the 44 spot beams, there will be 12 point-of-presence
beams that provide large-scale interconnection with terrestrial facili-
ties. The Astrolink satellite network will be ATM-based and will be
compatible with terrestrial technologies, including the Internet
Protocol (IP). The ATM-based technology enables the satellites to pro-
vide the bandwidth-on-demand service where the customer is only
charged for the bandwidth used. Customers will be able to transmit at
speeds up to 20 Mb/s and to receive or download at speeds up to 220
Mb/s. Further details are available at www.astrolink.com.
Loral Cyberstar.
Scheduled for operation in 2001, the Cyberstar satellite
segment consists of three geostationary satellites operating in the Ka
band (Farserotu and Prasad, 2000). A number of gateway teleports are
stationed around the world, which provide access to and from the satel-
lite segment. In addition, the company operates point-of-presence sites in
North America, which are part of the high-speed link between Internet
and the satellite. Small WWW requests from a host to the Internet are
transported over a terrestrial link. Cyberstar provides IP multicast ser-
vices. Multicast service is where information is sent to a specified group

of users; for example, it might be used for conferencing. Cyberstar makes
use of digital video broadcast (DVB) to send IP packets. Briefly, DVB is
a worldwide standard used for the transmission of digital TV via satel-
lites (DVB-S), cable (DVB-C), and terrestrial (DVB-T). DVB supports
data transmission as well as video and can carry multiple program
streams (Liebowitz, 2000). In the Cyberstar system, the IP data packets
are “repackaged” into an MPEG-2 format, which then form the IP/DVB
stream. (The MPEG-2 format is described in Chap. 16.) In general, a
DVB signal is received on a integrated receiver decoder (IRD), which is
available either as a set-top box or on a PC card. The Cyberstar system
uses a set-top unit that supports data rates up to 4 Mb/s, with an 8-Mb/s
IRD to be introduced. For simplex operation, the receiver only is needed,
along with the antenna and LNB feed. For most locations, a small anten-
na, less than 1 m in diameter, can be used. Duplex operation requires in
addition the installation of a standard SCPC transmitter for the return
link. Basically, this is a VSAT installation. Further details can be
obtained at www.cyberstar.com.
SkyBridge.
Scheduled for operation in 2001, Skybridge will use 80 low
earth orbiting (LEO) satellites in a circular orbit at an altitude of 1469
km (913 miles) and inclination of 53°. The control ground segment
(CGS) includes the satellite control center and the telemetry and com-
mand ground stations. The CGS controls all aspects of the satellite con-
stellation, including satellite positioning and orientation. Satellite
positions are determined by the global positioning satellite system
(GPS; see Sec. 17.5). Carrier frequencies are in the Ku band, uplinks
being in the range 12.75 to 14.5 GHz and downlinks in the range 10.7
to 12.75 GHz. Right-hand circular (RHC) and left-hand circular (LHC)
polarizations are used to maximize frequency utilization. Each satellite
operates with a total of 18 spot beams that carry the uplink and down-
link signals. No onboard processing is used, the satellites being in the
“bent pipe” category. Approximately 200 gateway stations are planned
worldwide, which interface with the terrestrial network, and user ter-
minals are linked to the gateways through the satellites. The user ter-
minal consists of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit, which, of course,
includes the antenna. Two levels of user terminals are envisioned. One
is a residential terminal, where the outdoor unit is small enough to be
installed on a residential rooftop. The residential terminal can handle
bit rates of up to 20 Mb/s for the forward link and 2 Mb/s for the return
link. The other is a larger terminal suited to professional use, includ-
ing distribution to several users. This professional terminal can handle
traffic of up to 100 Mb/s on the forward link and 10 Mb/s on the return
link. The equipment is larger than that used with the residential ter-
minal, with the outdoor unit being designed for installation on larger

buildings. Great care has been taken in system design to avoid inter-
ference with geostationary satellite systems that utilize Ku-band fre-
quencies; also, power densities should be low enough to prevent
interference with terrestrial Ku-band systems. Skybridge supports a
wide range of applications including multimedia applications over
broadband Internet. The low propagation delay with the LEOs makes
the system usable for real-time applications. Further details can be
obtained at www.skybridgesatellite.com.
Spaceway.
Spaceway should begin operating in 2002 with an initial
North American constellation of two geostationary satellites. These will
by Hughes-built HS 702 satellites, the network being part of the Hughes
Network Systems. These satellites will have onboard processing, packet
switching, and spot-beam technology. The assigned North American
slots are at 101°W and 99°W. International geostationary slots have
been assigned at 49°W, 25°E, 54°E, 101°E, 111°E, and 164°E for future
expansion (details from www.hns.com/spaceway/spaceway.htm).
According to Farserotu and Prasad (2000), the Spaceway system even-
tually will have 16 satellites in the geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and
20 in medium earth orbits (MEO), the latter being at an altitude of
10352 km. Frequencies will be in the Ka band, and uplink rates will
range from 16 kb/s to 6 Mb/s. A number of network protocols are pro-
vided, including IP/ATM, and users will be able to access the system
through 66-cm (26-in) antennas. A comparison of data rates as given in
the Sapceway Web site is reproduced in Table 15.2.
iSky.
Formerly KaSTAR Satellite Communications, iSky plans to start
its Internet broadband service in late 2001 marketed to homes and small
businesses in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.
Geostationary satellites will be used, the first, iSky-1 being located at
109.2°W. A large number of spot beams will be used rather than a single
continental U.S. (CONUS) beam. Telesat, a Canadian company, has an
agreement with iSky to offer Ka-band multimedia capacity through their
Anik F2 satellite, scheduled for launch in 2002, at an orbital position of

111.1°W, and in 2002, iSky will launch it iSky-2 satellite, which will cov-
er Latin America. The satellites initially deployed will use the “bent pipe”
technology, but the company envisions advanced onboard signal process-
ing for future satellites. The user package includes a 66-cm (26-in) dish
and a modem that provides a two-way satellite connection. An initial
downlink speed of 1.5 Mb/s will be offered, and it is envisaged that this
will be increased to 40 Mb/s. The uplink speed is 0.5 Mb/s. iSky and
EchoStar are working in partnership to develop a single dish and single
box for use with EchoStar’s DISH Network satellite TV and iSky’s high-
speed data service. iSky’s Web site is at www.iSKY.net.
Teledesic.
This system should be operational by 2002. It has the
trademark name Internet in the Sky, with the stated objective of meet-
ing terrestrial network standards and protocols rather than changing
them. To this end, it plans to deploy a total of 288 satellites in low
earth orbits (LEOs) and ground terminals that interface between the
satellite network, end users, and terrestrial networks. Translation
occurs at these terminals between the standard protocols of the ter-
restrial systems and the internal protocol of the Teledesic satellite net-
work. Most users will employ uplink speeds of up to 2 Mb/s and
downlink speeds of up to 64 Mb/s, although broadband terminals also
will be available that support 64 Mb/s both ways. Ka-band carriers are
used, the uplink being in the range 28.6 to 29.1 GHz and the downlink
18.8 to 19.3 GHz. The satellite constellation ensures that the elevation
angle (satellite angle above the horizon) does not fall below 40.25° for
any user. This limits the line-of-sight path length through possible
rain cells and helps to avoid possible obstacles, allowing the company
to claim an availability figure of 99.9 percent or greater. The satellites
are at an altitude of 1375 km, and intersatellite links (ISLs) operating
at 60 GHz are employed, along with full onboard processing (OBP) and
onboard switching (OBS) (Farserotu and Prasad, 2000). Further
details can be found at www.teledesic.com.
It should be noted that although this chapter is on Internet applica-
tions, these proposed systems carry other types of network traffic such
as Asynchronous Transmission Mode (ATM already explained),
Integrated Digital Systems Network (ISDN), and Frame Relay. Details
of these protocols will be found in Russell (2000). Also, a brief descrip-
tion of these proposed systems and some European systems will be
found in Williamson (1999).

Direct Broadcast Satellite
Services
16.1
Introduction
Satellites provide broadcast transmissions in the fullest sense of the
word, since antenna footprints can be made to cover large areas of the
earth. The idea of using satellites to provide direct transmissions into
the home has been around for many years, and the services provided
are known generally as direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services.
Broadcast services include audio, television, and Internet services.
Internet services are covered in Chap. 15, and this chapter is con-
cerned mainly with television.
A comprehensive overview covering the early years of DBS in
Europe, the United States, and other countries is given in Pritchard
and Ogata (1990). Some of the regulatory and commercial aspects of
European DBS will be found in Chaplin (1992), and the U.S. market
is discussed in Reinhart (1990). Reinhart defines three categories of
U.S. DBS systems, shown in Table 1.4. Of interest to the topic of this
chapter is the high power category, the primary intended use of which
is for DBS .
16.2
Orbital Spacings
From Table 1.4 it is seen that the orbital spacing is 9° for the high-pow-
er satellites, so adjacent satellite interference is considered nonexis-
tent. The DBS orbital positions along with the transponder allocations
for the United States are shown in Fig. 16.1. It should be noted that

although the DBS services are spaced by 9°, clusters of satellites occupy
the nominal orbital positions. For example, the following satellites are
located at 119°W longitude: EchoStar VI, launched on July 14, 2000;
EchoStar IV, launched on May 8, 1998; EchoStar II, launched
September 10, 1996; and EchoStar I, launched on December 28,1995
(source http://www.dishnetwork.com/).
16.3
Power Rating and Number of
Transponders
From Table 1.4 it will be seen that satellites primarily intended for
DBS have a higher [EIRP] than for the other categories, being in 
the range 51 to 60 dBW. At a Regional Administrative Radio Council
(RARC) meeting in 1983, the value established for DBS was 57 dBW
(Mead, 2000). Transponders are rated by the power output of their
high-power amplifiers. Typically, a satellite may carry 32 transpon-
ders. If all 32 are in use, each will operate at the lower power rating
of 120 W. By doubling up the high-power amplifiers, the number 
of transponders is reduced by half to 16, but each transponder oper-
ates at the higher power rating of 240 W. The power rating has a
direct bearing on the bit rate that can be handled, as described in
Sec. 16.8.
16.4
Frequencies and Polarization
The frequencies for direct broadcast satellites vary from region to
region throughout the world, although these are generally in the Ku
band. For region 2 (see Sec. 1.2), Table 1.4 shows that for high-power
satellites, whose primary use is for DBS, the uplink frequency range
is 17.3 to 17.8 GHz, and the downlink range is 12.2 to 12.7 GHz. The
medium-power satellites listed in Table 1.4 also operate in the Ku
band at 14 to 14.5 GHz uplink and 11.7 to 12.2 GHz downlink. The
primary use of these satellites, however, is for point-to-point applica-
tions, with an allowed additional use in the DBS service. In this chap-
ter only the high-power satellites intended primarily for DBS will be
discussed.
The available bandwidth (uplink and downlink) is seen to be 500
MHz. A total number of 32 transponder channels, each of bandwidth 24
MHz, can be accommodated. The bandwidth is sometimes specified as
27 MHz, but this includes a 3-MHz guardband allowance. Therefore,
when calculating bit-rate capacity, the 24 MHz value is used, as shown
in the next section. The total of 32 transponders requires the use of
both right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left-hand circular
Direct Broadcast Satellite Services

TLFeBOOK

polarization (LHCP) in order to permit frequency reuse, and guard
bands are inserted between channels of a given polarization. The DBS
frequency plan for Region 2 is shown in Fig. 16.2.
16.5
Transponder Capacity
The 24-MHz bandwidth of a transponder is capable of carrying one
analog television channel. To be commercially viable, direct broad-
cast satellite (DBS) television [also known as direct-to-home (DTH)
television] requires many more channels, and this requires a move
from analog to digital television. Digitizing the audio and video com-
ponents of a television program allows signal compression to be
applied, which greatly reduces the bandwidth required. The signal
compression used in DBS is a highly complex process, and only a
brief overview will be given here of the process. Before doing this, an
estimate of the bit rate that can be carried in a 24-MHz transponder
will be made.
From Eq. (10.16), the symbol rate that can be transmitted in a given
bandwidth is
Rsym  
(16.1)
Thus, with a bandwidth of 24 MHz and allowing for a rolloff factor of
0.2, the symbol rate is

This is the bit rate that can be carried in the 24-MHz channel using

16.6
Bit Rates for Digital Television
The bit rate for digital television depends very much on the picture for-
mat. Some values are shown in Table 16.1.
It can be seen, therefore, that the bit rate ranges from 118 Mb/s for
standard television at the lowest pixel resolution to 995 Mb/s for high-
definition TV at the highest resolution. Although HDTV is “on its
way,” this chapter will be limited to the bit rates encountered with
SDTV. As a note of interest, the broadcast raster for studio-quality
television, when digitized according to the international CCIR-601
television standard, requires a bit rate of 216 Mb/s (Netravali and
Lippman, 1995). Therefore, considering an uncompressed bit rate of
around 200 Mb/s for the video signal alone gives some idea of the mag-
nitudes involved.

A single DBS transponder has to carry somewhere between four and
eight TV programs to be commercially viable (Mead, 2000). The pro-
grams may originate from a variety of sources, film, analog TV, and
videocassette, for example. Before transmission, these must all be con-
verted to digital, compressed, and then time-division multiplexed
(TDM). This TDM baseband signal is applied as QPSK modulation to
the uplink carrier reaching a given transponder.
The compressed bit rate, and hence the number of channels that are
carried, depends on the type of program material. Talk shows where
there is little movement require the lowest bit rate, while sports chan-
nels with lots of movement require comparatively large bit rates.
Typical values are in the range of 4 Mb/s for a movie channel, 5 Mb/s
for a variety channel, and 6 Mb/s for a sports channel (Fogg, 1995).
Compression is carried out to MPEG standards.
16.7
MPEG Compression Standards
MPEG stands for Moving Pictures Expert Group, a group within the
International Standards Organization and the International
Electrochemical Commission (ISO/IEC) that undertook the job of
defining standards for the transmission and storage of moving pic-
tures and sound. The standards are concerned only with the bit-
stream syntax and the decoding process, not with how encoding and
decoding might be implemented. Syntax covers such matters as bit
rate, picture resolution, time frames for audio, and the packet details
for transmission. The design of hardware for the encoding and decod-
ing processes is left up to the equipment manufacturer. Com-
prehensive descriptions of the MPEG can be found at the Web site
http://www.mpeg.org and in Sweet (1997) and Bhatt et al. (1997). The
MPEG standards currently available are MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-
4, and MPEG-7. For a brief explanation of the “missing numbers,” see
Koenen (1999).
In DBS systems, MPEG-2 is used for video compression. As a first
or preprocessing step, the analog outputs from the red (R), green (G),
and blue (B) color cameras are converted to a luminance component
(Y) and two chrominance components (Cr) and (Cb). This is similar to
the analog NTSC arrangement shown in Fig. 9.7, except that the
coefficients of the matrix M are different. In matrix notation, the
equation relating the three primary colors to the Y, Cr, and Cb com-
ponents is

The Y, C, and Cb signals are sampled in the digitizer shown in Fig.
16.3. It is an observed fact that the human eye is less sensitive to reso-
lution in the color components (Cr and Cb) than the luminance (Y) com-
ponent. This allows a lower sampling rate to be used for the color
components. This is referred to as chroma subsampling, and it repre-
sents one step in the compression process. For example, in the CCIR-
601-1 standard, sampling along the horizontal axis for the color
components is less by a factor 2 compared with the luminance sampling.
This is written as 4:2:2 sampling.
Following the digitizer, difference signals are formed, and the discrete
cosine transform (DCT) block converts these to a “spatial frequency”
domain. The familiar Fourier transform transforms a time signal g(t) to
a frequency domain representation G(f), allowing the signal to be filtered
in the frequency domain. Here, the variables are time t and frequency f.
In the DCT situation, the input signals are functions of the x (horizon-
tal) and y (vertical) space coordinates, g(x, y). The DCT transforms these
into a domain of new variables u and v, G(u, v). The variables are called
spatial frequencies in analogy with the time-frequency transform. It
should be noted that g(x, y) and G(u, v) are discrete functions. In the

quantizer following the DCT transform block, the discrete values of G(u,
v) are quantized to predetermined levels. This reduces the number of
levels to be transmitted and therefore provides compression. The com-
ponents of G(u, v) at the higher spatial frequencies represent finer spa-
tial resolution. The human eye is less sensitive to resolution at these
high spatial frequencies; therefore, they can be quantized in much
coarser steps. This results in further compression. (This step is analo-
gous to the nonlinear quantization discussed in Sec. 10.3.)
Compression is also achieved through motion estimation. Frames in
MPEG-2 are designated I, P, and B frames, and motion prediction is
achieved by comparing certain frames with other frames. The I frame 
is an independent frame, meaning that it can be reconstructed without
reference to any other frames. A P (for previous) frame is compared with
the previous I frame, and only those parts which differ as a result of move-
ment need to be encoded. The comparison is carried out in sections called
macroblocks for the frames. A B (for bidirectional) frame is compared with
the previous I or P frame and with the next P frame. This obviously
means that frames must be stored in order for the forward comparison to
take place. Only the changes resulting from motion are encoded, which
provides further compression. Taking the 200 Mb/s deduced in Sec. 16.6
as the uncompressed rate, and taking 5 Mb/s as typical of that for a TV
channel, the compression needed is on the order 200/5  40:1. The 5 Mb/s
would include audio and data, but these should not take more than about
200 kb/s. Audio compression is considered later in this section.
The whole encoding process relies on digital decision-making cir-
cuitry and is computationally intensive and expensive. The decoding
process is much simpler because the rules for decoding are part of the
syntax of the bit stream. Decoding is carried out in the integrated
receiver decoder (IRD) unit. This is described in Sec. 16.8.
In DBS systems, MPEG-1 is used for audio compression, and as dis-
cussed earlier, MPEG-2 is used for video compression. Both of these
MPEG standards cover audio and video, but MPEG-1 video is not
designed for DBS transmissions. MPEG-1 audio supports mono and
two-channel stereo only, which is considered adequate for DBS sys-
tems currently in use. MPEG-2 audio supports multichannel audio in
addition to mono and stereo. It is fully compatible with MPEG-1 audio,
so the integrated receiver decoders (IRDs), which carry MPEG-2
decoders, will have little trouble in being upgraded to work with DBS
systems transmitting multichannel audio.
The need for audio compression can be seen by considering the bit
rate required for high-quality audio. The bit rate is equal to the num-
ber of samples per second (the sampling frequency fs) multiplied by the
number of bits per sample n:
Rb  fs  n
(16.3)
468
Chapter Sixteen
TLFeBOOK

For a stereo CD recording, the sampling frequency is 44.1 kHz, and the
number of bits per sample is 16:
Rb  44.1  103  16  2
 1411.2 kb/s
The factor 2 appears on the right-hand side because of the two chan-
nels in stereo. This bit rate, approximately 1.4 Mb/s, represents too
high a fraction of the total bit rate allowance per channel, and hence
the need for audio compression. Audio compression in MPEG exploits
certain perceptual phenomena in the human auditory system. In par-
ticular, it is known that a loud sound at one particular frequency will
mask a less intense sound at a nearby frequency. For example, consider
a test conducted using two tones, one at 1000 Hz, which will be called
the masking tone, and the other at 1100 Hz, the test tone. Starting with
both tones at the same level, say, 60 dB above the threshold of hear-
ing, if now the level of the 1000-Hz tone is held constant while reduc-
ing the level of the 1100-Hz tone, a point will be reached where the
1100-Hz tone becomes inaudible. The 1100-Hz tone is said to be
masked by the 1000-Hz tone. Assume for purposes of illustration that
the test tone becomes inaudible when it is 18 dB below the level of the
masking tone. This 18 dB is the masking threshold. It follows that any
noise below the masking threshold also will be masked.
For the moment, assuming that only these two tones are present,
then it can be said that the noise floor is 18 dB below the masking tone.
If the test-tone level is set at, say, 6 dB below the masking tone, then
of course it is 12 dB above the noise floor. This means that the signal-
to-noise ratio for the test tone need be no better than 12 dB. Now in a
pulse-code modulated (PCM) system the main source of noise is that
arising from the quantization process (see Sec. 10.3). It can be shown
(see, for example, Roddy and Coolen, 1995) that the signal-to-quanti-
zation noise ratio is given by
 q
 22n
(16.4)
where n is the number of bits per sample. In decibels this is
 	q
 10 log 22n

 6n dB
(16.5)
This shows that increasing n by 1 bit increases the signal-to-quanti-
zation noise ratio by 6 dB. Another way of looking at this is to say that
S

a 1-bit decrease in n increases the quantization noise by 6 dB. In the
example above where 12 dB is an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, Eq.
(16.5) shows that only 2 bits are needed to encode the 1100-Hz tone
(i.e., the levels would be quantized in steps represented by 00, 01, 10,
11). By way of contrast, the CD samples taken at a sampling frequen-
cy of 44.1 kHz are quantized using 16 bits to give a signal-to-quanti-
zation noise ratio of 96 dB.
Returning to the example of two tones, in reality, the audio signal
will not consist of two single tones but will be a complex signal cover-
ing a wide spectrum of frequencies. In MPEG-1, two processes take
place in parallel, as illustrated in Fig. 16.4. The filter bank divides the
spectrum of the incoming signal into subbands. In parallel with this
the spectrum is analyzed to permit identification of the masking lev-
els. The masking information is passed to the quantizer, which then
quantizes the subbands according to the noise floor.
The masking discussed so far is referred to as frequency masking for
the reasons given above. It is also an observed phenomenen that the
masking effect lasts for a short period after the masking signal is
removed. This is termed temporal masking, and it allows further com-
pression in that it extends the time for which the reduction is quanti-
zation applies. There are many more technical details to MPEG-1 than
can be covered here, and the reader is referred to Mead (2000), which
contains a detailed analysis of MPEG-1. The MPEG Web page at
http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/audio.html also provides a number of
articles on the subject. The compressed bit rate for MPEG-1 audio
used in DBS systems is 192 kb/s.

Forward Error Correction
Because of the highly compressed nature of the DBS signal, there is
little redundancy in the information being transmitted, and bit errors

affect the signal much more severely than they would in a noncom-
pressed bit stream. As a result, forward error correction is a must.
Concatenated coding is used (see Sec. 11.6). The outer code is a Reed-
Solomon code that corrects for block errors, and the inner code is a con-
volution code that corrects for random errors. The inner decoder
utilizes the Viterbi decoding algorithm. These FEC bits, of course, add
overhead to the bit stream. Typically, for a 240-W transponder (see
Sec. 16.3), the bit capacity of 40 Mb/s (see Sec. 16.5) may have a pay-
load of 30 Mb/s and coding overheads of 10 Mb/s. The lower-power 120-
W transponders require higher coding overheads to make up for the
reduction in power and have a payload of 23 Mb/s and coding over-
heads of 17 Mb/s. More exact figures are given in Mead (2000) for
DirecTV, where the overall code rates are given as 0.5896 for the 120-
W transponder and 0.758 for the 240-W transponder.
Mead (2000) has shown that with FEC there is a very rapid transi-
tion in BER for values of [Eb/No] between 5.5 and 6 dB. For [Eb/No] val-
ues greater than 6 dB, the BER is negligible, and for values less than
5.5 dB, the BER is high enough to render the system useless.
Advances in coding techniques promise a further increase in transpon-
der capacity. A system patented by France Telecom (see Vollmer, 2000),
when used with 8-PSK, should realize a 50 percent increase in the bit
rate capacity of a transponder. The new codes are called Turbo codes, and
details will be found in Hewitt and Thesling (2000).

The Home Receiver Outdoor Unit
(ODU)
The home receiver consists of two units, an outdoor unit and an indoor
unit. Commercial brochures refer to the complete receiver as an inte-
grated receiver decoder (IRD). Figure 16.5 is a block schematic for the
outdoor unit (ODU). This will be seen to be similar to the outdoor unit
shown in Fig. 8.1. The downlink signal, covering the frequency range
12.2 to 12.7 GHz, is focused by the antenna into the receive horn. The
horn feeds into a polarizer that can be switched to pass either left-
hand circular to right-hand circular polarized signals. The low-noise
block that follows the polarizer contains a low-noise amplifier (LNA)
and a downconverter. The function of the LNA is described in Sec. 12.5.
The downconverter converts the 12.2- to 12.7-GHz band to 950 to 1450
MHz, a frequency range better suited to transmission through the con-
necting cable to the indoor unit.
The antenna usually works with an offset feed (see Sec. 6.14), and a
typical antenna structure is shown in Fig. 16.6. It is important that
the antenna have an unobstructed view of the satellite cluster to
Direct Broadcast Satellite Services
471
TLFeBOOK

which it is aligned. Alignment procedures are described in Sec. 3.2.
The size of the antenna is a compromise among many factors but typ-
ically is around 18 in (46 cm) in diameter. A small antenna is desirable
for a number of reasons. Small antennas are less intrusive visually
and also are less subject to wind loading. In manufacture, it is easier
to control surface irregularities, which can cause a reduction in gain
by scattering the signal energy. The reduction can be expressed as a
function of the root-mean-square (rms) deviation of the surface,
referred to an ideal parabolic surface. The reduction in gain is given
by (see Baylin and Gale, 1991)
rms  e8.8/
(16.6)
where  is the rms tolerance in the same units as , the wavelength.
For example, at 12 GHz (wavelength 2.5 cm) and for an rms tolerance
of 1 mm, the gain is reduced by a factor

This is a reduction of about 1.5 dB.
The isotropic power gain of the antenna is proportional to (D/)2, as
shown by Eq. (6.32), where D is the diameter of the antenna. Hence,
increasing the diameter will increase the gain (less any reduction
resulting from rms tolerance), and in fact, many equipment manufac-
turers provide signal-strength contours showing the size of antenna
that is best for a given region. Apart from the limitations to size stated
above, it should be noted that at any given DBS location there are clus-
ters of satellites, as described in Sec. 16.2. The beamwidth of the anten-
na must be wide enough to receive from all satellites in the cluster. For
example, the Hughes DBS-1 satellite, launched December 18, 1993, is
located at 101.2°W longitude; DBS-2, launched August 3, 1994, is at
Direct Broadcast Satellite Services
473

100.8°W longitude; and DBS-3, launched June 3, 1994, is at 100.8°W
longitude. There is a spread of plus or minus 0.2° about the nominal
101°W position. The 3-dB beamwidth is given as approximately
70/D, as shown by Eq. (6.33). A 60-cm dish at 12 GHz would have a
3-dB beamwidth of approximately 70  2.5/60  2.9°, which is ade-
quate for the cluster.
16.10
The Home Receiver Indoor Unit (IDU)
The block schematic for the indoor unit (IDU) is shown in Fig. 16.7. The
transponder frequency bands shown in Fig. 16.2 are downconverted to
be in the range 950 to 1450 MHz, but of course, each transponder
retains its 24-MHz bandwidth. The IDU must be able to receive any of
the 32 transponders, although only 16 of these will be available for a sin-
gle polarization. The tuner selects the desired transponder. It should be
recalled that the carrier at the center frequency of the transponder is
QPSK modulated by the bit stream, which itself may consist of four to
eight TV programs time-division multiplexed. Following the tuner, the
carrier is demodulated, the QPSK modulation being converted to a bit
stream. Error correction is carried out in the decoder block labeled
FEC1. The demultiplexer following the FEC1 block separates out the
individual programs, which are then stored in buffer memories for fur-
ther processing (not shown in the diagram). This further processing
would include such things as conditional access, viewing history of pay-
per-view (PPV) usage, and connection through a modem to the service
provider (for PPV billing purposes). A detailed description of the IRD
will be found in Mead (2000).
16.11
Downlink Analysis
The main factor governing performance of a DBS system will be the
[Eb/No] of the downlink. The downlink performance for clear-sky condi-
tions can be determined using the method described in Sec. 12.8 and illus-
trated in Example 12.2 that follows. The effects of rain can be calculated
using the procedure given in Sec. 12.9.2 and illustrated in Example 12.3
that follows. These examples are worked in Mathcad (see Appendix H). In
calculating the effects of rain, use is made of Fig.16.8, which shows the
regions (indicated by letters) tabulated along with rainfall in Table 16.2.
Example 16.1
A ground station located at 45°N and 90°W is receiving the
transmission from a DBS at 101°W. The [EIRP] is 55 dBW, and the downlink
frequency may be taken as 12.5 GHz for calculations. An 18-in-diameter
antenna is used, and an efficiency of 0.55 may be assumed. Miscellaneous
transmission losses of 2 dB also may be assumed. For the IRD, the equivalent

Table 16.2 and Fig. 16.8 show the rainfall intensity in mm/h
exceeded for given percentages of time. Calculate the upper limit for [Eb/No]
set by the rainfall for the percentage of time equal to 0.01 percent. The earth
station is at mean sea level, and the rain attenuation may be assumed
entirely absorptive, and the apparent absorber temperature may be taken
as 272 K.
solution
It is first necessary to calculate the attenuation resulting from the
rain. The given data are shown below. Because the CCIR formula contains
hidden conversion factors, units will not be attached to the data, and it is
understood that all lengths and heights are in km, and rain rate is in mm/h.
The elevation angle, however, must be stated in degrees in order for
Mathcad to correctly evaluate the sine and cosine functions.
From Fig. 16.8, the earth station is seen to be located within region K.
From the accompanying Table 16.2, the rainfall exceeds 42 mm/h for 0.01
percent of the time.

Thus the rain will completely wipe out the signal for 0.01 percent of the
time. It is left as an exercise for the reader to find the size of antenna that
would provide an adequate signal under these rain conditions.

Uplink
Ground stations that provide the uplink signals to the satellites in a
DBS system are highly complex systems in themselves, utilizing a
wide range of receiving, recording, encoding, and transmission equip-
ment. Signals will originate from many sources. Some will be analog
TV received from satellite broadcasts. Others will originate in a stu-

dio, others from video cassette recordings, and some will be brought in
on cable or optical fiber. Data signals and audio broadcast material
also may be included. All of these must be converted to a uniform dig-
ital format, compressed, and time-division multiplexed (TDM).
Necessary service additions which must be part of the multiplexed
stream are the program guide and conditional access. Forward error
correction (FEC) is added to the bit stream, which is then used to
QPSK modulate the carrier for a given transponder. The whole
process, of course, is duplicated for each transponder carrier.
Because of the complexity, the uplink facilities are concentrated at
single locations specific to each broadcast company. The uplink facili-
ties for Echostar’s DISH network is shown in Fig. 16.9. The four uplink
facilities in operation as of 1996, as given in Mead (2000), are shown in

Introduction
The idea that three geostationary satellites could provide communica-
tions coverage for the whole of the earth, apart from relatively small
regions at the north and south poles, is generally credited to Arthur C.
Clarke (1945). The basic idea was sound, but of course the practicali-
ties led to the development of a much more complex undertaking than
perhaps was envisioned originally. Technological solutions were found
to the many problems that were encountered, and as a result, satellite
services expanded into many new areas. Geostationary satellites are
still the most numerous and well in excess of three! If an average of 2°
spacing is assumed, the geostationary orbit could hold 180 such satel-
lites. Of course, the satellites are not deployed evenly around the orbit
but are clustered over regions where services are most in demand.
Direct-to-home broadcasting, referred to as direct broadcast satellite
(DBS) service in the United States, represents one major development
in the field of geostationary satellites. Another is the use of very small
aperture terminals (VSATs) for business applications. A third geosta-
tionary development is mobile satellite service (MSAT), which extends
geostationary satellites services into mobile communications for vehi-
cles, ships, and aircraft.
Rapid development also has been taking place in services using non-
geostationary satellites. Radarsat is a large polar-orbiting satellite
designed to provide environmental monitoring services. Possibly the
most notable development in the area of nongeostationary satellites is
the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system which has come into
everyday use for surveying and position location generally.
Although the developments in satellites generally have led to a need
for larger satellites, a great deal has been happening at the other end

of the size spectrum, in what is referred to as microsats (see, for exam-
ple, Sweeting, 1992, and Williamson, 1994). In this chapter, brief
descriptions are given of some of these services to illustrate the range
of applications now found for satellites.
17.2
Satellite Mobile Services
Although countries in the developed world are well served by global
communications, there remain large areas and population groups that
have very limited access to telecommunications services. In the United
States and some European countries, telephone landline density, mea-
sured by the number of phone lines per 100 people, is as much as 30
times higher than in China, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and
an estimated 3 billion people have no phone at home (Miller, 1998).
Developing a telephone network on the ground, whether wired or cellu-
lar, is time-consuming and expensive. Civil infrastructure may need to
be installed or upgraded, including roads and utilities such as water and
electricity. Once satellites are deployed in orbit, they can provide wide-
area service for telephone, facsimile, and Internet on an as-needed basis
without the need for extensive ground facilities. Table 17.1 lists some
satellite mobile services. Most of the systems that offer telephone ser-
vices provide the users with dual-mode phones that operate to GSM
standards. GSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communications
(originally Groupe Spe’cial Mobile); it is the most widely used standard
for cellular and personal communications. A number of these systems
are in the initial, setting-up stages, and network configuration and cov-
erage may change as operating experience is gained. The Web site
addresses given below should be consulted for most recent information.
As shown in Table 17.1, the user frequencies are in the L and S bands.
This requires the use of large antennas in the range 100 to 200 m 2
aboard the geostationary satellites.
The Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), which system provides posi-
tion and location services, is covered in Sec. 17.5, and Orbcomm, which
provides mainly data services, is covered in Sec. 17.6.
Asian Cellular System.
The Asian Cellular System, or AceS, utilizes
one Garuda geostationary satellite covering the Asia Pacific area. A
second satellite will be employed to expand the service into western
and central Asia, Europe, and northern Africa. Each satellite has
capacity for at least 11,000 simultaneous telephone channels, servic-
ing up to 2 million subscribers. The satellites utilize two 12-m anten-
nas that generate 140 spot beams, with onboard digital switching and
routing of calls between beams. Subscribers are provided with a dual-
mode phone that can be switched between satellite and the GSM

modes of operation. Services include voice telephony, Internet connec-
tivity, data, and alerting and paging. Further information can be
obtained from the Web site at http://www.aces.co.id.
Ellipso.
Ellipso is designed on the basis that the population density to
be served is concentrated in the northern hemisphere, with very low
population density below 50°S latitude. The system uses a combina-
tion of medium earth orbits (MEOs) consisting of an equatorial orbit
at height 8040 km and two elliptical orbits with apogee height 7846
km and perigee height 520 km. The equatorial orbit has the trademark
name Concordia, and it will be noted that although it is equatorial, it
is not geostationary. Satellites in Concordia orbit serve the region
between the 50°N and 50°S latitudes. The elliptical orbits, which have
the trademark name Borealis, have their apogees over the northern
hemisphere. As noted in Sec. 2.3, the orbital velocity is lowest at
apogee, and this provides for longest visibility over the northern hemi-
sphere. No onboard signal processing takes place, the satellites oper-
ating in the bent pipe mode. CDMA is used. Services include voice
telephony, Internet, data, and alerting and paging. Further informa-
tion can be obtained from the Web site at http://www.ellipso.com/.
Globalstar.
Globalstar employs 48 satellites in circular low earth orbits
(LEOs) in eight planes at a height of 1414 km. There are also 4 in-orbit
spares. Several satellites carry a call simultaneously, thus providing
path diversity, which minimizes the danger of a signal being blocked by
buildings, trees, or other objects. A range of services is offered, includ-
ing voice telephony, mobile (hands-free), and two-way short messaging
service (SMS). Service is also provided to fixed telephone sites, bring-
ing telephone services to underserved and developing economies with-
out the need for extensive infrastructure on the ground. Globalstar
handsets are multimode, allowing selection between GSM, AMPS (ana-
log mobile phone service), and CDMA. Switching and routing take
place in the gateway ground stations, obviating the need for switching

MSAT.
Operated by Telesat Mobile Inc., in Ottawa, the MSAT-1 satel-
lite covers the primary service area of Canada and the United States.
A variety of services are offered, including tracking and managing
trucking fleets, wireless phone, data and fax, dispatch radio services,
and differential GPS. Further information can be obtained from the
Web site at http://www.msat.tmi.ca/.
New ICO.
The space segment consists of 12 satellites in medium earth
orbits (MEOs). Two orbits are used, at inclinations of 45° and 135°
(i.e., the orbits are at right angles to each other). Orbital height is
10,390 km. Ten of the satellites are active, and 2 are in-orbit spares.
The satellites operate in the “bent pipe” mode, the switching and rout-
ing being carried out at the ground stations. Services being offered or
anticipated include voice telephony, Internet connectivity, data, and
fax using the GSM standard. Further information can be obtained
from the Web site at http://www.ico.com/.
Thuraya.
The Thuraya satellite is in geostationary orbit located at
44°E and serving an area between about 20°W to 100°E longitude and
60°N to 2°S latitude. A 12.25  16 m antenna is employed providing
250 to 300 spot beams, with onboard beam-switching. The system
operates with a 10-dB fade margin to allow for shadowing of hand-
held units. The network capacity is about 13,750 telephone channels.
QPSK modulation is used, with FDMA/TDMA. Dual-mode handsets
are used that can be switched between GSM mode and satellite mode.
Service features include voice telephony, fax, data, short messaging,
location determination, emergency services, and high-power alerting.
Further information can be obtained from the Web site at
http://www.thuraya.com/.
17.3
VSATs
VSAT stands for very small aperture terminal system. This is the dis-
tinguishing feature of a VSAT system, the earth station antennas
being typically less than 2.4 m in diameter (Rana et al., 1990). The
trend is toward even smaller dishes, not more than 1.5 m in diameter
(Hughes et al., 1993). In this sense, the small TVRO terminals
described in Sec. 16.9 for direct broadcast satellites could be labeled as
VSATs, but the appellation is usually reserved for private networks,
mostly providing two-way communications facilities. Typical user
groups include banking and financial institutions, airline and hotel
490
Chapter Seventeen
TLFeBOOK

booking agencies, and large retail stores with geographically dispersed
outlets.
The basic structure of a VSAT network consists of a hub station
which provides a broadcast facility to all the VSATs in the network and
the VSATs themselves which access the satellite in some form of mul-
tiple-access mode. The hub station is operated by the service provider,
and it may be shared among a number of users, but of course, each
user organization has exclusive access to its own VSAT network. Time-
division multiplex is the normal downlink mode of transmission from
hub to the VSATs, and the transmission can be broadcast for reception
by all the VSATs in a network, or address coding can be used to direct
messages to selected VSATs.
Access the other way, from the VSATs to the hub, is more compli-
cated, and a number of different methods are in use, many of them
proprietary. A comprehensive summary of methods is given in Rana et
al. (1990). The most popular access method is frequency-division mul-
tiple access (FDMA), which allows the use of comparatively low-power
VSAT terminals (see Sec. 14.7.12). Time-division multiple access
(TDMA) also can be used but is not efficient for low-density uplink
traffic from the VSAT. The traffic in a VSAT network is mostly data
transfer of a bursty nature, examples being inventory control, credit
verification, and reservation requests occurring at random and possi-
bly infrequent intervals, so allocation of time slots in the normal
TDMA mode can lead to low channel occupancy. A form of demand-
assigned multiple access (DAMA) is employed in some systems in
which channel capacity is assigned in response to the fluctuating
demands of the VSATs in the network. DAMA can be used with FDMA
as well as TDMA, but the disadvantage of the method is that a reserve
channel must be instituted through which the VSATs can make
requests for channel allocation. As pointed out by Abramson (1990),
the problem of access then shifts to how the users may access the
reserve channel in an efficient and equitable manner. Abramson pre-
sents a method of code-division multiple access (CDMA) using spread-
spectrum techniques, coupled with the Aloha protocol. The basic Aloha
method is a random-access method in which packets are transmitted
at random in defined time slots. The system is used where the packet
time is small compared with the slot time, and provision is made for
dealing with packet collisions which can occur with packets sent up
from different VSATs. Abramson calls the method spread Aloha and
presents theoretical results which show that the method provides the
highest throughput for small earth stations.
VSAT systems operate in a star configuration, which means that the
connection of one VSAT to another must be made through the hub. This
requires a double-hop circuit with a consequent increase in propagation
Satellite Services

TLFeBOOK

delay, and twice the necessary satellite capacity is required compared
with a single-hop circuit (Hughes et al., 1993). In Hughes, a proposal
is presented for a VSAT system which provides for mesh connection,
where the VSATs can connect with one another through the satellite
in a single hop.
Most VSAT systems operate in the Ku band, although there are
some C-band systems in existence (Rana et al., 1990). For fixed-area
coverage by the satellite beam, the system performance is essentially
independent of the carrier frequency. For fixed-area coverage, the
beamwidth and hence the ratio /D is a constant (see Eq. 6.33). The
satellite antenna gain is therefore constant (see Eq. 6.32), and for a
given high-power amplifier output, the satellite EIRP remains con-
stant. As shown in Sec. 12.3.1, for a given size of antenna at the earth
station and a fixed EIRP from the satellite, the received power at the
earth station is independent of frequency. This ignores the propagation
margins needed to combat atmospheric and rain attenuation. As
shown in Hughes et al. (1993), the necessary fade margins are not
excessive for a Ka-band VSAT system, and the performance otherwise
is comparable with a Ku-band system. (From Table 1.1, the K band
covers 18 to 27 GHz and Ka band covers 27 to 40 GHz. In Hughes,
1993, results are presented for frequencies of 18.7 and 28.5 GHz.)
As summarized in Rana et al. (1990), the major shortcomings of pre-
sent-day VSAT systems are the high initial costs, the tendency toward
optimizing systems for large networks (typically more than 500
VSATs), and the lack of direct VSAT-to-VSAT links. Technological
improvements, especially in the areas of microwave technology and
digital signal processing (Hughes et al., 1993), will result in VSAT sys-
tems in which most if not all of these shortcomings will be overcome.

Radarsat

gram, as stated by the Canadian Space Agency, are to

safety

synthetic aperture radar (SAR)

Radarsat is planned to fly in a low-earth near-circular orbit. The
orbital details are given in Table 17.2.
It will be seen from the orbital parameters that Radarsat flies in an
orbit similar to the NOAA satellites described in Chap. 1; in particu-
lar, it is sun-synchronous. There are fundamental differences, howev-
er. Radarsat carries only C-band radar as the sensing mechanism,
whereas the NOAA satellites carry a wide variety of instruments, as
described in Secs. 1.5 and 7.11. Even though it is known that C-band
radar is not the optimal sensing mechanism for all the applications
listed, the rationale for selecting it is that it does penetrate cloud cov-
er, smoke, and haze, and it does operate in darkness. Much of the sens-
ing is required at high latitudes, where solar illumination of the earth
can be poor and where there can be persistent cloud cover.
It also will be seen that the orbit is described as dawn to dusk. What
this means is that the satellite is in view of the sun for the ascending and
descending passages. With the radar sensor it is not necessary to have the
earth illuminated under the satellite; in other words, the sun’s rays reach
the orbital plane in a broadside fashion. The main operational advantage,
suggested in Raney et al. (1991), is that the radar becomes fully depen-
dent on solar power rather than battery power for both the ascending and
descending passes. Since there is no operational need to distinguish

between the ascending and descending passes, nearly twice as many
observations can be made than otherwise would be possible. Also, as
Raney et al. point out, the downlink periods for data transmission from
Radarsat will take place at times well-removed from those used by other
remote-sensing satellites. Further advantages stated by the Canadian
Space Agency are that the solar arrays do not have to rotate, the arrange-
ment leads to a more stable thermal design for the spacecraft, the space-
craft design is simpler, and it provides for better power-raising
capabilities. With this particular dawn-to-dusk orbit, the satellite will be
eclipsed by the earth in the southern hemisphere from May 15 to July 30.
The eclipse period changes gradually from zero to a maximum of about 15
minutes and back again to zero, as shown in Fig. 17.1. The battery back-
up consists of three 50 Ah nickel-cadmium batteries.
Radarsat, shown in Fig. 17.2, is a comparatively large spacecraft,
the total mass in orbit being about 3100 kg. The radar works at a car-
rier frequency of 5.3 GHz, which can be modulated with three differ-
ent pulse widths, depending on resolution requirements. The SAR
operating modes are illustrated in Fig. 17.3. The swath illuminated by
the radar lies 20° to the east and parallel to the subsatellite path. As
shown, different beam configurations can be achieved, giving different
resolutions. The mode characteristics are summarized in Table 17.3.
The satellite completes 14  7/24 revolutions per day. The separation
between equatorial crossings is 116.8 km. According to Raney et al.
(1991), the scanning SAR is the first implementation of a special radar
technique. In summary, Radarsat is intended as a rapid response sys-
tem providing earth imagery for a range of operational applications and
is intended to complement other earth resources satellites.

Global Positioning Satellite System
In the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system, a constellation of 24
satellites circles the earth in near-circular inclined orbits. By receiving
signals from at least four of these satellites, the receiver position (lati-
tude, longitude, and altitude) can be determined accurately. In effect,
the satellites substitute for the geodetic position markers used in ter-
restrial surveying. In terrestrial surveying, it is only necessary to have
three such markers to determine the three unknowns of latitude, lon-
gitude, and altitude by means of triangulation. With the GPS system,

a time marker is also required, which necessitates getting simultane-
ous measurements from four satellites.
The GPS system uses one-way transmissions, from satellites to
users, so that the user does not require a transmitter, only a GPS
receiver. The only quantity the receiver has to be able to measure is
time, from which propagation delay, and hence the range to each satel-
lite, can be determined. Each satellite broadcasts its ephemeris (which
is a table of the orbital elements as described in Chap. 2), from which
its position can be calculated. Knowing the range to three of the satel-
lites and their positions, it is possible to compute the position of the
observer (user). The geocentric-equatorial coordinate system (see Sec.
2.9.6) is used with the GPS system, where it is called the earth-cen-
tered, earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system.
As mentioned above, if the positions of three points relative to the
coordinate system are known and the distance from an observer to each
of the points can be measured, then the position of the observer relative
to the coordinate system can be calculated. In the GPS system, the
three points are provided by three satellites. Of course, the satellites
are moving, so their positions must be tracked accurately. The satellite
orbits can be predicted from the orbital parameters (as described in
Chap. 2). These parameters are continually updated by a master con-
trol station which transmits them up to the satellites, where they are
broadcast as part of the navigational message from each satellite.
Just as in a land-based system, better accuracy is obtained by using
reference points well separated in space. For example, the range mea-
surements made to three reference points clustered together will yield
nearly equal values. Position calculations involve range differences, and
where the ranges are nearly equal, any error is greatly magnified in the
difference. This effect, brought about as a result of the satellite geome-
try, is known as dilution of precision (DOP). This means that range
errors which occur from other causes, such as timing errors, are magni-
fied by the geometric effect. With the GPS system, dilution of position is
taken into account through a factor known as the position dilution of
precision (PDOP) factor. This is the factor by which the range errors are
multiplied to get the position error. The GPS system has been designed
to keep the PDOP factor less than 6 most of the time (Langley, 1991c).
The GPS constellation consists of 24 satellites in six near-circular
orbits, at an altitude of approximately 20,000 km (Daly, 1993). The
ascending nodes of the orbits are separated by 60°, and the inclination
of each orbit is 55°. The four satellites in each orbit are irregularly
spaced to keep the PDOP factor within the limits referred to above.
It was stated earlier that three satellites are needed to fix position. In
the GPS system, a minimum of four satellites must be observed, for rea-
sons which will be explained shortly. Where more than four satellites
496
Chapter Seventeen
TLFeBOOK

are in view, the additional data are used to minimize errors by using the
method of least squares.
Each satellite broadcasts its ephemeris, which contains the orbital
elements needed to calculate its position, and as previously men-
tioned, the ephemerides are updated and corrected continuously from
an earth control station. It should be mentioned that the GPS system
is first and foremost intended for military use. However, civilian appli-
cations have now become quite extensive and are an accepted part of
the GPS program.
Time enters into the position determination in two ways. First, the
ephemerides must be associated with a particular time or epoch (as
described in Chap. 2). The standard timekeeper is an atomic standard,
maintained at the U.S. Naval Observatory, and the resulting time is
known as GPS time. Each satellite carries its own atomic clock. The
time broadcasts from the satellites are monitored by the control station
which transmits back to the satellites any errors detected in timing rel-
ative to GPS time. No attempt is made to correct the clocks aboard the
satellites; rather, the error information is rebroadcast to the user sta-
tions, where corrections can be implemented in the calculations.
Second, time markers are needed to show when transmissions leave
the satellites so that, by measuring propagation times and knowing
the speed of propagation, the ranges can be calculated. Therein lies a
problem, since the user stations have no direct way of telling when a
transmission from a satellite commenced. The problem is overcome by
having the satellite transmit a continuous-wave carrier which is mod-
ulated by a clocking signal, both the carrier and the clocking signal
being derived from the atomic clock aboard the satellite. At a user sta-
tion, the receiver generates a replica of the modulated signal from its
own atomic clock. The satellite signal and its replica are compared in
a correlator at the receiver, and the replica is shifted in time until
exact correlation is achieved. If the receiver clock kept exactly the
same time as the satellite clock, the time shift as measured by the cor-
relator would give the propagation delay. However, the receiver clock
in general will be offset from the satellite clock (which is synchronized
to GPS time) by an unknown amount. This offset will be the same for
the signals received from the four satellites, and hence by obtaining
four range measurements, four equations can be set up in terms of the
x,y,z position vectors for the user and the time offset. The four equa-
tions can then be solved for these four unknowns. All this requires
quite sophisticated microprocessing in the receiver. Also, the composi-
tion of the GPS signal is much more complex than indicated here, uti-
lizing spread-spectrum techniques. The reader is referred to the
following for details: Langley (1990a, 1991b, 1991c), Kleusberg and
Langley (1990), and Mattos (1992, 1993a, 1993b, 1993c, 1993d, 1993e).

Orbcomm
The Orbital Communications Corporation (Orbcomm) system is a low
earth orbiting (LEO) satellite system intended to provide two-way mes-
sage and data communications services and position determination. In
the Orbcomm submission to the FCC (Orbcomm, 1993), the planned
launch dates extend from about mid-1994 to early 1998, with near-full
availability expected by December 1995, contingent on licensing factors.
There are to be four main orbital planes, each containing eight satel-
lites spaced from each other by 45° ± 5°. The inclination of each of the
main planes is 45°, and the altitude is 775 km (424 nautical miles, or
482 statute miles). The main plane orbits are circular (eccentricity
zero). Two supplemental orbits at 70° inclination, each having two
satellites, will complete the constellation. The latter two orbits are
intended to provide enhanced polar coverage. The satellites and their
orbital parameters are listed in Table 17.4.
The ground segment consists of the subscribers (mobile or stationary),
gateway earth stations (GES) which provide access to terrestrial sys-
tems such as the public switched telephone network and other mobile
systems, a network control center (NCC), and a satellite control center
(SCC). The network control center and the satellite control center are
collocated at the Dulles, Virginia, Orbcomm facility, and the four gate-
way earth stations for the U.S. services are located near the corners of
the contiguous United States (CONUS) in Washington state, Arizona,
Georgia, and New York state. Figure 17.4 illustrates the system.
The satellites are small compared with the geostationary satellites
in use, as shown in Fig. 17.5. The VHF/UHF antennas are seen to
extend in a lengthwise manner, with the solar panels opening like lids
top and bottom. Before launch, the satellites are in the shape of a disk,
and the launch vehicle, a Pegasus XL space booster [developed by
Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), the parent company of Orbcomm]
can deploy eight satellites at a time into the same orbital plane. For
launch, the satellites are stacked like a roll of coins, in what the com-
pany refers to as “an eight-pack.”
Attitude control is required to keep the antennas pointing down-
ward and at the same time to keep the solar panels in sunlight (bat-
tery backup is provided for eclipse periods). A three-axis magnetic
control system, which makes use of the earth’s magnetic field, and
gravity gradient stabilization are employed. A small weight is added at
the end of the antenna extension to assist in the gravity stabilization.
Thus the satellite antennas hang down as depicted in Fig. 17.4. At
launch, the initial separation velocity is provided by springs used to
separate the satellites, and a braking maneuver is used when the
satellites reach their specified 45° in-plane separation. Intraplane
spacing is maintained by a proprietary station-keeping technique
498
Chapter Seventeen
TLFeBOOK

which, it is claimed, has no cost in terms of fuel usage (Orbcomm,
1993). Because no onboard fuel is required to maintain the intraplane
spacing between satellites, the satellites have a design lifetime of 4
years, which is based on the projected degradation of the power sub-
system (solar panels and batteries).
The messaging and data channels are located in the VHF band, the
satellites receiving in the 148- to 149.9-MHz band and transmitting in
the 137- to 138-MHz band. Circular polarization is used, and a sum-
mary of the frequencies and polarization plans is given in Table 17.5.

In planning the frequency assignments, great care has been taken to
avoid interference to and from other services in the VHF bands; the
reader is referred to Orbcomm (1993) for details. In particular, the
subscriber-to-satellite uplink channels utilize what is termed a
dynamic channel activity assignment system (DCAAS), in which a
scanning receiver aboard the satellite measures the interference
received in small bandwidths, scanning the entire band every 5 s or
less. The satellite receiver can then prepare a list of available channels
(out of a total of 760) and prioritize these according to interference lev-
els expected. A summary of the link budget calculations for the up-
links and downlinks is given in Tables 17.6 to 17.11.
The Orbcomm system is capable of providing subscribers with a
basic position determination service through the use of Doppler posi-
tioning, which fixes position to within a few hundred meters. The bea-
con signal at 400.1 MHz is used to correct for errors in timing
measurements introduced by the ionosphere (these errors are also pre-
sent in the GPS system described in Sec. 17.5, and two frequencies are
used in that situation for correction purposes). When used in conjunc-
tion with the VHF downlink signal, the beacon signal enables the
effects of the ionosphere to be removed. The link budget figures for the

400.1-MHz channel are summarized in Table 17.11. It will be observed
from Fig. 17.5 that the satellites carry GPS antennas which enable on-
board determinations of the positions of the satellites. This informa-
tion can then be downloaded on the VHF subscriber channel and used
for accurate positioning. Recently, Orbcomm announced an agreement
with Trimble Navigation to develop hybrid GPS/Orbcomm user equip-
ment for position and navigation purposes (Orbcomm, 1993). The sys-
tem also can be used for search and rescue and may well be a strong
competitor to the search and rescue service described in Sec. 1.5.
One significant advantage achieved with low earth orbits is that the
range is small compared with geostationary satellites (the altitude of
the Orbcomm satellites is 775 km compared with 35,876 km for geo-
stationary satellites). Thus the free-space loss (FSL) is very much less.
Propagation delay is correspondingly reduced, but this is not a signif-
icant factor where messaging and data communications, as compared
to real-time voice communications, are involved.
The Orbcomm system will provide a capacity of more than 60,000
messages per hour. By using digital packet switching technology, and
confining the system to nonvoice, low-speed alphanumeric transmis-
sions, Orbcomm calculates that the service, combined with other LEO

Conic Sections
A conic section, as the name suggests, is a section taken through a
cone. At the intersection of the sectional plane and the surface of the
cone, curves having many different shapes are produced, depending on
the inclination of the plane, and it is these curves which are referred
to generally as conic sections. Although the origin of conic sections lies
in solid geometry, the properties are readily expressed in terms of
plane geometrical curves. In Fig. B.1a, a reference line for conic sec-
tions, known as the directrix, is shown as Z-D. The axis for the conic
sections is shown as line Z-Z′. The axis is perpendicular to the direc-
trix. The point S on the axis is called the focus. For all conic sections,
the focus has the particular property that the ratio of the distance SP
to distance PQ is a constant. SP is the distance from the focus to any
point P on the curve (conic section), and PQ is the distance, parallel to
the axis, from point P to the directrix. The constant ratio is called the
eccentricity, usually denoted by e. Referring to Fig. B.1a,
e 
(B.1)
The conic sections are given particular names according to the val-
ue of e, as shown in the following table:
Curve
Eccentricity e
Ellipse
e  1
Parabola
e  1
Hyperbola
e 1
These curves are encountered in a number of situations. In this book
they are used to describe (1) the path of satellites orbiting the earth,
(2) the ellipsoidal shape of the earth, and (3) the outline curves for var-
ious antenna reflectors.

A polar equation for conic sections with the pole at the foci can be
obtained in terms of the fixed distance p, called the semilatus rectum.
The polar equation relates the point P to the radius r and the angle 
(Fig. B.1b). From Fig. B.1b,

Also,

Combining Eqs. (B.2) and (B.3) and simplifying gives the polar
equation as

If the angle is measured from SA, shown as  in Fig. B.1c, then, 
since   180°  , the polar equation becomes

(B.5)
The Ellipse
For the ellipse, e  1. Referring to Eq. (B.4), when   0°, r  p/(1  e).
Since e  1, r is positive. At   90°, r  p, and at   180°, r  p/(1 
e). Thus r decreases from a maximum of p/(1  e) to a minimum of r 
p/(1  e), the locus of r describing the closed curve A′BMA (Fig. B.2).
Also, since cos ()  cos , the curve is symmetrical about the axis,
and the closed figure results (Fig. B.2a).
The length AA′ is known as the major axis of the ellipse. The semi-
major axis a  AA′/2 and e are the parameters normally specified for
an ellipse. The semilatus rectum p can be obtained in terms of these
two quantities. As already shown, the maximum value for r is SA′ 
p/(1  e) and the minimum value is SA  p/(1  e). Adding these two
values gives

The equation for an ellipse in rectangular coordinates with origin at

r2  (c 	 x)2 	 y2
But r  ePQ  e(OZ 	 x)  e(a/e 	 x)  a 	 ex. Hence
(a 	 ex)2  (c 	 x)2 	 y2
Multiplying this out and simplifying gives

Hence,

(B.14)
This shows the symmetry of the ellipse, since for a fixed value of y the
x2 term is the same for positive and negative values of x. Also, because
of the symmetry, there exists a second directrix and focal point to the
right of the ellipse. The second focal point is shown as S′ in Fig. B.2c.

In satellite orbital calculations, time is often measured from the
instant of perigee passage. Denote the time of perigee passage as T
and any instant of time after perigee passage as t. Then the time inter-
val of significance is t  T. Let A be the area swept out in this time
interval, and let Tp be the periodic time. Then, from Kepler’s second
law,
A  	ab 
(B.20)
The mean motion is n  2	/Tp and the mean anomaly is M  n (t  T).

The auxiliary circle is the circle of radius a circumscribing the ellipse
as shown in Fig. B.4. This also shows the eccentric anomaly, which is
angle E, and the true anomaly v (both of which are measured from

This shows that the sum of the focal distances is constant, or in other
words, the ray paths from one focus to the other which go via an ellip-
tical reflector are equal in length. Thus electromagnetic radiation ema-
nating from a source placed at one of the foci will have the same
propagation time over any reflected path, and therefore, the reflected
waves from all parts of the reflector will arrive at the other foci in
phase. This property is made use of in the Gregorian reflector antenna
described in Sec. 6.15.
The Parabola
For the parabola, the eccentricity e  1. Referring to Fig. B.7, since e
 SA/AZ, by definition it follows that SA  AZ. Let f  SA  AZ. This
is known as the focal length. Consider a line LP′ drawn parallel to the
directrix. The path length from S to P′ is r  PP′. But PP′  AL  f
 r cos , and hence the path length is r(1  cos )  AL  f.

Substituting for r from Eq. (B.4) with e  1 yields a path length of p

the focus and reflected parallel to the axis (ZZ′) is constant. It is this
property which results in a parallel beam being radiated when a
source is placed at the focus.
It will be seen that when   90°, r  SP  p. But SP  eSZ  2f
(since e  1), and therefore, p  2f. Thus the radius as given by Eq.

The Hyperbola
For the hyperbola, e  1. The curve is sketched in Fig. B.10. Equation
(B.4) still applies, but it will be seen that for cos   1/e the radius
goes to infinity; in other words, the hyperbolic curve does not close on
itself in the way that the ellipse does but lies parallel to the radius at
this value of . In constructing the ellipse, because e was less than
unity, it was possible to find a point A′ to the right of S for which the
ratio SA′/A′Z  e applied in addition to the ratio e  SA/AZ. With the

hyperbola, because e  1, a point A′ to the left of S can be found for
which e  SA′/A′Z in addition to e  SA/AZ. By setting 2a equal to the
distance A′A and making the midpoint of A′A equal to the x,y co-

By plotting values it will be seen that a symmetrical curve results

An application of this property is shown in Fig. 6.23a of the text
which is redrawn in Fig. B.13. By placing the focus of the parabolic
reflector at the focus S of the hyperbola and the primary source at the
focus S′, the total path length S′P 	 PP″ is equal to 2a 	 SP 	 PP″ or
2a 	 SP″. But, as shown previously in Fig. B.7, the focusing properties
of the parabola rely on there being a constant path length SP″ 	 P″P′,
and adding the constant 2a to SP″ does not destroy this property.
The double-reflector arrangement can be analyzed in terms of an
equivalent parabola. The equivalent parabola has the same diameter
as the real parabola and is formed by the locus of points obtained at P′
which is the intersection of S′P produced to P′ and P″P′ which is par-
allel to the x axis, as shown in Fig. B.14. The focal distance of the
equivalent parabola is shown as fe and of the real parabola as f.
Looking from the focus S to the real parabola, one sees that

and let the carrier spacing be "
 as shown in Fig. E.1. The terms on
the right-hand side of the transfer characteristic equation can be inter-
preted as follows:
First term, aei. This gives the desired linear relationship between eo
and ei.
Second term, bei2. With ei as shown, this term can be expanded into
the following components: a dc component, a component at frequency
"
, second harmonic components of the carriers, second harmonic 
 "
 components. All these components can be removed by filtering
and need not be considered further.

Logarithmic Units
Decibels
A power ratio of P1/P2 expressed in bels is
log10   bels
The bel was introduced as a logarithmic unit which allowed addition
and subtraction to replace multiplication and division. As such, it
proved to be inconveniently large, and the decibel, abbreviated dB, is
the unit now in widespread use. The same power ratio expressed in
decibels is
10 log10   dB
Because the base 10 is understood, it is seldom, if ever, shown explic-
itly. The abbreviation dB, as shown below, is often modified to indicate
a reference level.
Although referred to as a unit, the decibel is a dimensionless quan-
tity, the ratio of two powers. Power by itself cannot be expressed in
decibels. However, by selecting unit power as one of the terms in the
ratio, power can be expressed in decibels relative to this. A power
expressed in decibels relative to 1 W is shown as dBW. For example,
50 W expressed in decibels relative to 1 W would be equivalent to
10 log

Another commonly used reference is the milliwatt, and decibels rel-
ative to this are shown as dBm. Thus 50 W relative to 1 mW would be
10 log 

 47 dBm
By definition, the ratio of two voltages V1 and V2 expressed in deci-
bels is
20 log 
dB
The multiplying factor of 20 comes about because power is proportional
to voltage squared. Note carefully, however, that the definition of volt-
age decibels stands on its own and can be related to the corresponding
power ratio only when the ratio of load resistances is also known.
Similar arguments apply to current ratios. Also, unit voltage may be
selected as a reference, which allows voltage to be expressed in decibels
relative to it. For example, 0.5 V expressed in decibels relative to 1 V is
20 log 

 6 dBV
Another common voltage reference is the microvolt, and 0.5 V
expressed in decibels relative to 1 V is
20 log 

 114 dBV
Decilogs
The decibel concept is extended to allow the ratio of any two like quan-
tities to be expressed in decibel units, these being termed decilogs. For
example, two temperatures T1 and T2 may be expressed as
10 log 
decilogs
Just as power and voltage can be expressed in decibels relative to
the unit quantity, so can other quantities. The name decilog is seldom
used, however, and common practice is to quote the decibel equivalent
for the quantity referred to the selected unit. For example, a tempera-
ture of 290 K would be given as
10 log 
 24.6 dBK

Another example which occurs widely in practice is that of frequency
referred to 1 Hz. A bandwidth of 36 MHz is equivalent to
10 log 
 75.56 dBHz
Apart from voltage and current, all decibel-like quantities are taken
as 10 log (). In this book, brackets are used to denote decibel quanti-
ties, using the basic power definition. A ratio X in decibels is thus
[X] 10 log X
The abbreviation dB is used, with letters added where convenient to
signify the reference. For example, a bandwidth b  3 kHz expressed
in decibels is
[b]  10 log 3000  34.77 dBHz
A quantity which occurs frequently in link budget calculations is
Boltzmann’s constant,
k  1.38  1023 J/K
Expressed in decibels relative to 1 J/K, this is
10 log k  228.6 dB
Strictly, the dB units should be written as dBJ/K for decibels relative
to 1 joule per kelvin. This is awkward, and it is simply shown as
228.6 dB.
If a voltage ratio Vr is to be expressed in decibels using the bracket
notation, it would be written as 2[Vr], since 20 log Vr  2[Vr]. A similar
argument applies to current ratios. Thus it must be kept in mind that
the brackets are identified always with 10 log ().
The more commonly used decibel-type abbreviations are summa-
rized below:
dBW: decibels relative to one watt
dBm: decibels relative to one milliwatt
dBV: decibels relative to one volt
dBV: decibels relative to one microvolt
dBK: decibels relative to one kelvin
dBHz: decibels relative to one hertz
dBb/s: decibels relative to one bit per second

1 Notation
Mathcad is a mathematical software package used in problem solving
throughout this book. Equations written in Mathcad appear on the
screen more or less the way one would write them by hand, which
makes them easy to interpret. There are some differences in notation,
however, which need to be explained. Values are assigned to variables
by means of a colon.
Typing the statement
x:5
appears on the screen as
x:  5
This is an assignment statement. To find the value of x, one types
x 
and the screen shows
x  5
Suppose a second variable y is typed in as
y:x2
This appears on the screen as
y:  x2

TLFeBOOK

Typing in
y 
results in the screen displaying
y  25
There are various ways in which a range of values can be assigned
to a variable. The statement
x:0;9
appears on the screen as
x:  0 .. 9
meaning that x takes on all integer values from 0 to 9. Thus a colon
appearing in front of an equal sign means the value or values to the
right are being assigned to the variable on the left. The normal equal
sign gives the value that the variable has, which of course may have
changed from the assigned value through computation.
Mathcad has built-in units, the default set being SI units. These are
best illustrated by means of a simple example. To set a current equal
to 3 amperes, one types
I:3*amp
and this appears on the screen as
I:  3  amp
Likewise,
R:10*ohm
appears as
R:  10  ohm
The statement
V:I*R
appears as
V:  I  R
554
Appendix H
TLFeBOOK

Typing
V 
appears as
V  30  kg  m2  sec2  coul1 I
This gives the voltage in terms of fundamental units. A units
placeholder 
I appears at the end. Placing the cursor on this and typ-
ing in the desired units changes these automatically. Thus, setting
the cursor on the 
I and typing volt gives
V  30  volt
The units will change values automatically. Thus, in Example 2.1 of
the text, the mean motion n is defined as
n: 
This sets n equal to 2	 radians per day. Typing
n 
results in
n  7.272  105  sec1 I
Typing rad/sec at the units placeholder results in
n  7.272  105 
Typing in rad/day results in
n  6.283 
(These values have been rounded off.)

Interference
13.1
Introduction
With many telecommunications services using radio transmissions,
interference between services can arise in a number of ways. Figure
13.1 shows in a rather general way the possible interference paths
between services. It will be seen in Fig. 13.1 that the terms earth sta-
tion and terrestrial station are used, and the distinction must be care-
fully noted. Earth stations are specifically associated with satellite
circuits, and terrestrial stations are specifically associated with
ground-based microwave line-of-sight circuits. The possible modes of
interference shown in Fig. 13.1 are classified by the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU, 1985) as follows:
A1: terrestrial station transmissions, possibly causing interference
to reception by an earth station
A2: earth station transmissions, possibly causing interference to
reception by a terrestrial station
B1: space station transmission of one space system, possibly causing
interference to reception by an earth station of another space system
B2: earth station transmissions of one space system, possibly caus-
ing interference to reception by a space station of another space sys-
tem
C1: space station transmission, possibly causing interference to
reception by a terrestrial station
C2: terrestrial station transmission, possibly causing interference to
reception by a space station

TLFeBOOK

E: space station transmission of one space system, possibly causing
interference to reception by a space station of another space system
F: earth station transmission of one space system, possibly causing
interference to reception by an earth station of another space system
A1, A2, C1, and C2 are possible modes of interference between space
and terrestrial services. B1 and B2 are possible modes of interference
between stations of different space systems using separate uplink and
downlink frequency bands, and E and F are extensions to B1 and B2
where bidirectional frequency bands are used.
The Radio Regulations (ITU, 1986) specify maximum limits on radi-
ated powers (more strictly, on the distribution of energy spectral den-
sity) in an attempt to reduce the potential interference to acceptable
levels in most situations. However, interference may still occur in cer-
tain cases, and what is termed coordination between the telecommu-
nications administrations that are affected is then required.
Coordination may require both administrations to change or adjust
some of the technical parameters of their systems.

For geostationary satellites, interference modes B1 and B2 set a low-
er limit to the orbital spacing between satellites. To increase the capac-
ity of the geostationary orbit, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) in the United States has in recent years authorized
a reduction in orbital spacing from 4° to 2° in the 6/4-GHz band. Some
of the effects that this has on the B1 and B2 levels of interference are
examined later in the chapter. It may be noted, however, that although
the larger authorized operators will in general be able to meet the
costs of technical improvements needed to offset the increased inter-
ference resulting from reduced orbital spacing, the same cannot be
said for individually owned television receive-only (TVRO) installa-
tions (the “home satellite dish”), and these users will have no recourse
to regulatory control (Chouinard, 1984).
Interference with individually owned TVRO receivers also may
occur from terrestrial station transmissions in the 6/4-GHz band.
Although this may be thought of as an A1 mode of interference, the fact
that these home stations are considered by many broadcasting compa-
nies to be “pirates” means that regulatory controls to reduce interfer-
ence are not applicable. Some steps that can be taken to reduce this
form of interference are described in a publication by the Microwave
Filter Company (1984).
It has been mentioned that the Radio Regulations place limits on the
energy spectral density which may be emitted by an earth station.
Energy dispersal is one technique employed to redistribute the trans-
mitted energy more evenly over the transmitted bandwidth. This prin-
ciple is described in more detail later in this chapter.
Intermodulation interference, briefly mentioned in Sec. 7.7.3, is a
type of interference which can occur between two or more carriers
using a common transponder in a satellite or a common high-power
amplifier in an earth station. For all practical purposes, this type of
interference can be treated as noise, as described in Sec. 12.11.
13.2
Interference between Satellite Circuits
(B1 and B2 Modes)
A satellite circuit may suffer the B1 and B2 modes of interference
shown in Fig. 13.1 from a number of neighboring satellite circuits, the
resultant effect being termed aggregate interference. Because of the
difficulties of taking into account the range of variations expected in
any practical aggregate, studies of aggregate interference have been
quite limited, with most of the study effort going into what is termed
single-entry interference studies (see Sharp, 1984a). As the name sug-
gests, single-entry interference refers to the interference produced by
a single interfering circuit on a neighboring circuit.

The advantage of decibel units is that they can be added directly,
even though different reference units may be used. For example, if a
power of 34 dBW is transmitted through a circuit which has a loss of
20 dB, the received power would be
[PR]  34  20  14 dBW
In some instances, different types of ratios occur, an example being
the G/T ratio of a receiving system described in detail in Sec. 12.6. G
is the antenna power gain, and T is the system noise temperature.
Now G by itself is dimensionless, so taking the log of this ratio requires
that the unit reciprocal temperature K1 be used. Thus
10 log 
  10 log G  10 log 
 [G]  [T] dBK1
The units are often abbreviated to dB/K, but this must not be inter-
preted as decibels per kelvin.
The Neper
The neper is a logarithmic unit based on natural, or naperian, loga-
rithms. Originally it was defined in relation to currents on a trans-
mission line which decayed according to an exponential law. The
current magnitude may decay from a value I1 to I2 over some distance
x so that the ratio is
 ex
where  is the attenuation constant. The attenuation is nepers is
defined as
N  ln 
 x
The same ratio expressed as an attenuation in decibels would be
D  20 log 
Since the same ratio is involved in both definitions, it follows that
 eN  10D/20
Thus D  20N log10 e  8.686N or 1 neper is equivalent to 8.686 decibels.
