Introduction
W
elcome to Service Management For Dummies. We think a service-
driven economy makes this topic increasingly important. Clearly, 
the way people manage business and IT services is changing dramatically. 
Companies get into trouble when they don’t look at their physical and busi-
ness assets as a unified measure of their ability to manage customers’ expec-
tations and experiences.
We think you should focus on the intersection of business strategy, IT strat-
egy, planning, and operations. Companies that plan to create an integrated 
service management platform are in a great position to evolve as opportuni-
ties and threats emerge.
Service management isn’t a quick fix: It’s stages of maturity that make your 
company better able to compete in a changing world. We hope that this 
book inspires you to take a different look at this very complicated and 
important area.
About This Book
Service management is a big topic covering lots of important issues that you 
must understand, whether you’re managing a data center, virtualizing your 
computing environment, looking for best practices, or getting a handle on 
all the technologies you need. We tie our service management discussions 
directly to the issue that companies care about most: meeting the key perfor-
mance indicators for their businesses. We think that understanding service 
management from a business perspective better prepares you to help your 
company succeed.
We recommend starting with Part I, because it puts into context the new way 
of thinking about managing the services that define your company. When 
you’re ready, dive into the technical details in Parts III and IV. In Part V, 
you’re rewarded with case studies that give you a taste of what real compa-
nies are doing to make their service management strategies work.

Service Management For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
We think this book will be useful to many people, but we have to admit 
that we chose a segment of the world to focus on when writing Service 
Management For Dummies. Here’s who we think you are:
 
✓ You’re thinking about technology from a business perspective. You 
care more about IT-enabled business services than about technical sys-
tems. Perhaps we’re preaching to the choir. We think you understand 
that you’re doomed to failure if your organization continues treating IT 
like an isolated fiefdom.
 
✓ You’re a businessperson who wants results from the IT you’ve 
invested in over the past decade. You want a business-driven service 
management strategy.
 
✓ You’re an educated IT person who’s having trouble focusing on ser-
vice management (versus server or systems management). You want to 
see how you can better leverage your existing capabilities and resources 
to satisfy customer expectations and improve value.
Whoever you are, we welcome you on this journey!
How This Book Is Organized
We organized this book into six parts for easy consumption. Feel free to skip 
about.
Part I: Introducing Service Management
In this section, we provide an overview of how to think about service man-
agement. We summarize the business drivers and the technical focus, and 
provide a perspective on the all-important customer.
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place
Before you can get into the details of service management, you need some 
context for best practices and standards. Starting with a strategy is impor-
tant, and strategy is an important focus of Part II.

3
 Introduction
Part III: Service Management 
Technical Foundation
Service management has a lot of important technical underpinnings. In this 
part, we put the foundation in context with governance principles.
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service 
Management
The data center and its many supporting services and infrastructure are the 
heart of this part. If you want to know how the data center is changing — 
with virtualization and cloud computing becoming important, for example — 
this is the part for you. We cover important enablers of service management, 
including security, business service management, and desktop management.
Part V: Real Life with 
Service Management
There’s nothing like hearing from real people who’ve made a difference for 
their real organizations with service management. In this part, some of those 
people share their best practices.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you’re new to the For Dummies treasure trove, you may be unfamiliar with 
the Part of Tens. Here, Wiley editors torture For Dummies authors into cre-
ating useful, accessible lists of ten (more or less) elucidating elements. We 
started these chapters kicking and screaming but ultimately were very glad 
that they’re here. We think you’ll be glad too.

Part I
Introducing 
Service 
Management

In this part . . .
E
xactly what is service management, beyond what the 
two words themselves imply? In this part, we provide 
a graphical and reasonably simple way of looking at ser-
vice management that explains it from both a business 
perspective and a technical perspective.

Chapter 1
Understanding Service 
Management
In This Chapter
▶ Defining service management
▶ Understanding that everything is a service
▶ Measuring, managing, and optimizing
▶ Delivering service in a complex world
A
service can be something as simple as preparing and delivering a meal 
to a table in a restaurant or as complex as managing the components 
of a data center or the operations of a factory. We’re entering an era in which 
everything is a service.
A service is a way of delivering value to a customer by facilitating the 
expected outcome. That definition sounds simple enough, but it can be 
rather complicated when you look deeper. Suppose that you’re hungry, and 
you want to get something to eat at a restaurant. You have some decisions 
to make. How quickly do you want or need a meal? How much time do you 
have? How much money do you want to spend? Are there types of food that 
you prefer? We make these types of decisions every minute of the day. So 
if you’re hungry, have 20 minutes and a limited amount of money, and want 
something familiar to eat, you might go to a fast-food restaurant, and your 
expectations probably will be met. In fact, you probably didn’t notice or even 
pay attention to any of the inner workings of the fast-food service provider. 
If the customer can find, order, receive, and be satisfied with the service — 
without incident — good service management is in place.
But what if something weird happened? You walk into that fast-food 
restaurant, expecting to get the sandwich you always order quickly, but 
instead, a hostess greets you and informs you that the wait for a table will be 
20 minutes. Lovely music is playing, and every table has a white tablecloth. 

8
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
Naturally, you’re confused. You start thinking about the inner workings of 
service management in that restaurant. What has gone wrong? Is someone 
not doing his job? Is some information about customer expectations missing? 
Is someone changing the expected outcomes without informing customers? 
You might even start trying to solve the problem by asking probing ques-
tions. In your confusion, you walk out of the restaurant and find somewhere 
else to get a sandwich.
Why are we telling you this crazy story? When you’re thinking about service 
management (monitoring and optimizing a service to ensure that it meets the 
critical outcomes the customer values and stakeholders want to provide), 
many dimensions and aspects may not be apparent at the outset.
In this chapter, we give you a glimpse into the new world of service manage-
ment. Clearly, effective service management requires an alignment of the 
overall business goals and objectives. This type of alignment isn’t a one-time 
task: An iterative cycle is involved, not only on a strategy level, but also 
within each stage of service management. Creating a valuable customer expe-
rience requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work that the customer never sees 
unless something goes wrong. As we show in the examples in this chapter, 
you can’t ignore one element of the overall service management process 
without affecting the way that the entire system works.
Knowing That Everything Is a Service
In an increasingly interconnected business world, everything is becoming 
a service. In fact, the very definition of service has changed. In the old days, 
when we talked about a service, we meant labor provided by the traditional 
services economy: restaurants, hotels, health care, banks, retail stores, and 
education. The services sector of the economy is filled with jobs for people 
who provide services, such as a teacher who educates your children, a nurse 
who cares for you in the hospital, or a doorman who opens the door for you 
at a hotel. Jobs in the shrinking industrial sector of the economy include 
operating machinery or computers as part of the process of producing a 
product, such as securing an engine in a new automobile or welding com-
ponents to make a bridge. Many people in the industrial sector continue to 
provide physical labor as part of the production process, but this process is 
increasingly augmented and transformed by technology. Now, as a result of 
the influx of technology, the manufacturing process has been transformed, 
and we need to talk about the manufactured products as services.
How is this possible? Well, think about manufactured products. At one time, 
manufacturing a product was straightforward. A manufacturer would decide 

9
 Chapter 1: Understanding Service Management
the most efficient way to create a product and continue to improve on that 
process until each new product was created in the least amount of time with 
the best results. In fact, this was precisely what Henry Ford did when he 
revolutionized the car industry in the early part of the 20th century. As long 
as the market and the technology remained the same, tweaking processes to 
gain efficiencies was remarkably reliable.
But technology has changed dramatically over the past decade, and it has 
fundamentally changed the way we can build products. Technology can 
become the essence of both cost reduction and strategic differentiation 
between winners and losers. As building new, innovative products and bring-
ing them to market in novel ways has become easier, the nature of creating 
products and managing services is changing.
Looking at How the Digital World Has 
Turned Everything Upside Down
Most manufacturers have replaced the traditional assembly line with a 
computer-driven process that focuses as much on capabilities and innovation 
as on efficiency. But this transformation has gone far beyond the manufacturing 
plant, extending to the way that products function after they leave the manu-
facturer. Today, products themselves have evolved to the point at which 
they are actually based on digital services.
Many types of manufactured products have been transformed into digitally 
based services. Some examples are medical devices, bridges, air-traffic-
control systems, digital cameras, and even toasters. In the old days, all these 
products were mechanical. A typical toaster, for example, had a mechanical 
timing mechanism that popped up your toast based on how you tuned the 
dial. If you wanted very dark toast, you set the dial to dark, which set the 
toaster’s timer for 75.4 seconds or so. You, the consumer, decided how much 
time was needed to make your toast. From a service management perspec-
tive, the service provider (toaster) and the customer (you) collaborated to 
provide the value that you wanted. The service provider made an asset that 
you owned (bread) into something that was more valuable to you (toast). 
Today, a toaster may have sensors that detect that you’re toasting a large 
bagel, for example; therefore, it adjusts the toasting time to that type of 
bread. The new toaster requires additional understanding on the part of the 
customer to get the full value from the service relationship.
Take this idea to the next level. X-ray machines have evolved from devices 
that put images on film into digital imaging machines that transform images 

10
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
into huge volumes of digital data — and that example is just the tip of the 
iceberg. Products today are designed with complex sensors, scanners, and 
wireless systems based on radio-frequency identification (RFID); therefore, 
a vast array of manufactured goods is actually a complex array of digital 
services that need to be managed, monitored, optimized, and transformed 
based on the market, as well as on regulatory and business demands. We are 
indeed entering a new world in which everything has become a service. For 
many organizations, the implications of managing in a service-based world 
are dramatic.
Implementing Service Management
What does “everything is a service” mean for how you implement service 
management? In brief, you need to do a lot more management of the services 
representing your business if they’re going to work efficiently.
We start with an example from the real world that everyone is familiar with: 
the automated teller machine (ATM). If you need to deposit money or get 
cash quickly, you use an ATM. To the casual observer, this idea may seem 
simple. (In fact, in the early days of the evolution of the ATM, its innovation 
was to help solve the process bottleneck caused by too many customers 
standing in line for too few tellers.) Behind the scenes, however, an ATM 
involves a complex business process.
The world of service management has two sides: the customer experience 
and the behind-the-scenes services that support the customer. True suc-
cess in service management means that customers’ expectations are met or 
exceeded in a predictable way. The behind-the-scenes activity is a complex 
business process, however. Whereas the service requires active collabora-
tion between you (the customer) and the ATM (the service provider), the 
customer isn’t required to understand the complexities of service manage-
ment that occur behind the scenes. The customer must perform activities 
according to agreed-to rules and terms, and the provider must perform 
activities according to the same set of rules and terms, but the customer isn’t 
required to understand the complexities of the entire service management 
system that makes everything work.
Start with the customer view of the service. You walk up to the machine, 
insert your bank card, input your personal identification number (PIN), and 
tell the system what type of transaction you want to make (such as “I need 
$20 from my checking account”). An automated system reads your account 
information and matches it against your PIN; then it checks to make sure 

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Service Management
that you have enough cash in your account. Within a few seconds (assuming 
that your PIN is right and you do have the money), cash appears in the tray. 
You get a printed receipt verifying that your balance has been debited $20. 
Then you go about your business, never really thinking about what happened 
behind the scenes.
In a competitive business world, banks recognize that it isn’t enough to use 
the familiar ATM only as a cash-transaction machine. The ATM is part of a 
(fictional) financial corporation that we call ABC Financial, which offers prod-
ucts and services such as insurance, loans, and certificates of deposit (CDs). 
ABC Financial decides that it could increase revenue if it leverages its rela-
tionship with the ATM customer.
From a customer experience perspective, the marketing department adds 
some new screens to the ATM, displaying messages such as this: “We offer 
wonderful new CDs at incredible interest rates. Do you want to learn more?”
If the customer indicates that she is interested in the CD, ABC Financial has 
a series of screens set up that immediately display information or provide 
options to receive a brochure or set up an appointment with a sales rep.
Such components, both technical and business, transform the ATM from a 
simple box that allows customers to avoid the teller line to a sophisticated 
service engine.
Managing Services Effectively
Managing services is not a one-time process. It involves making sure that all 
the moving parts work together as a system. You need to establish checks 
and balances for customer goals, financial goals, and marketing goals. 
Therefore, service management must be understood based on many dimen-
sions, ranging from customer experience metrics and business performance 
indicators to how individual components operate and interrelate. In Chapter 2, 
we show you the building blocks that you need to begin your journey toward 
service management.
Behind-the-scenes management activities
Behind the brightly colored ATM screen, a lot is going on. Here’s a sample of 
the type of service management that happens in the background:

12
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
 
✓ Data center management ensures that the banking transactions are 
handled in a secure, predictable, and reliable manner.
 
✓ The financial institution manages the ATM machines. In addition, the 
institution may support ATMs owned by other financial institutions. The 
contact between banks and banking systems has to be managed on both 
business and operational levels.
 
✓ A service desk is designed to help customers and the branch location 
deal with problems with the ATM.
 
✓ A business process is designed based on the way the company interacts 
with customers on marketing, regulatory, and oversight issues.
 
✓ Management ensures that the performance indicators that support busi-
ness objectives are met by new and existing product offerings.
 
✓ A system collects data generated by the various systems to make sure 
that the systems are operating in the correct manner, such as ensuring 
that each ATM has enough cash.
 
✓ A process is in place to handle incidents when they occur.
The company also has to answer a variety of questions such as these:
 
✓ What happens when an ATM fails? Who gets notified, and what 
happens next?
 
✓ How do we track where problems are happening?
 
✓ Do we know whether the network behind the ATM is the problem?
 
✓ Where do we keep track of the configuration of the parts that make up 
the ATM and the relationships among the parts, and how do we make 
changes in one part without interrupting the service?
 
✓ What level of service is required? Is the level of service something that 
we can dictate, or is it dictated by customer expectations?
 
✓ Can customer expectations be influenced? With a better understanding 
of customer expectations, could we build the service in such a way that 
customers prefer our service to other options, and what are those other 
options?
Because many systems have to interact to ensure that ABC’s ATM business 
is performing well, ABC needs a way to optimize the performance of the busi-
ness. Some regulations may apply in a particular state or region but not in 
another, for example. ABC needs to ask itself the following questions:
 
✓ Are we in compliance with both state and national rules?
 
✓ Can we prove that we’re in compliance?

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Service Management
In addition, the competitive market is changing. ABC needs to consider its 
approach to influencing customer behavior — how this year’s approach 
differs from last year’s, for example, and what factors influence customers’ 
buying and use behaviors.
Provider/customer collaboration
 
Service is a complex and dynamic collaboration between provider and cus-
tomer. Therefore, companies continually need to optimize the interactions of 
all the components that make up the service to ensure that changing business 
objectives are met, and they need to improve both the customer interaction 
and relationship over time.
Clearly, many issues affect the way that the seemingly simple ATM affects a 
business on a regular basis. If all systems of checks and balances are in place, 
and all components are managed in an efficient and effective manner, life 
is good. As in every process and every business, however, small issues can 
have a major impact — which is where service management comes in.
Suppose that ABC Financial is pleased with its ATM network; the network is 
well managed and secure, so everyone is happy. One day, an ATM services 
manager comes up with an idea to improve efficiency and save money: A 
third party could take over ATM repairs, which could save ABC as much as 
$100 million by replacing its in-house repair staff. ABC Financial learns a hard 
lesson, however. It doesn’t spend the time managing the effectiveness of the 
service provided by the third party; therefore, repair times are double what 
they had been. The repair processes may be efficient, but customers are 
unhappy, and they begin to call the support line in great numbers — and ABC 
Financial is forced to hire more call-center staff to address service issues.
A critical distinction exists between a management process and the service 
itself. In the ABC example, the company could establish a task force to try to 
find out why the level of customer satisfaction has dropped so rapidly, but 
as managers research the problem, customers begin to move to competing 
banks.
In the next couple of chapters, we walk through a holistic view of service 
management and show how all the parts relate to one another. This journey 
is a fun one, so we hope that you’ll jump onboard.

Chapter 2
Getting Inside Service 
Management
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding inputs and outputs
▶ Using assets and tools to deliver services
▶ Looking at a standardized process model
▶ Providing flexibility with skilled participants
▶ Overseeing the service
I
n this chapter, we introduce a very simple model of a service, looking at 
it from the inside. By providing some examples and figures, we help you 
understand how just about everything around you can be viewed as a service 
or a component of a service. To create a strategy for service management, 
you need to start by understanding some basic principles of service delivery 
and management. This chapter provides this basic level of information about 
managing services. To keep things simple, we ignore the fact that every 
service has a consumer and consider just what makes up a service from the 
inside.
 
Keep in mind one simple but important principle: The customer doesn’t really 
want to know what makes the service tick. He wants a service that provides a 
valuable result or outcome.
Building a Foundation for 
Service Management
In Chapter 1, we stake a huge claim and say that everything is a service. 
Although we’re a little cavalier in defining the term that way, we don’t have 
much choice, because what we’re really doing is focusing on every activity 

16
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
to which you can apply service management, such as delivering food in a res-
taurant, responding to customer service queries, or producing manufactured 
goods.
 
Think of every activity within a commercial organization as being a service or 
a component of a service.
We define service this way:
A service is a purposeful activity carried out for the benefit of a known 
target.
In this chapter, we’re interested primarily in the first half of that definition: A 
service is a purposeful activity. We focus on what a service looks like from the 
inside, as shown in the diagram in Figure 2-1.
 
Figure 2-1: 
An internal 
view of a 
service.
 
Assets and tools
Standardized
process model
Skilled
participants
Inputs
Outputs
As Figure 2-1 indicates, a service has inputs and outputs. The input is a 
request for the service — something that triggers the activity. The output of 
a service is an outcome. The outputs of a service provider can include both 
products and service outcomes, which can be anything from a product (an 
Apple iPod) to an outcome (a mowed lawn) to a product and service out-
come (a meal and restaurant service). The internal activity of the service 
transforms the inputs into the outcomes. It typically involves people, whom 
we refer to in Figure 2-1 as skilled participants. It involves the assets and tools 
(which can be as simple as a pen and paper or as complex as a manufactur-
ing plant) that are used to execute the service. The service also involves 
a standardized process model — a method for delivering the service. This 
process may be so simple that the skilled participants can pick it up in a few 
hours, or it may be complex, consisting of sets of rules that shape systems 
and determine how a whole department within an organization carries out 
its work.

17
 Chapter 2: Getting Inside Service Management
The services that we’re most interested in are the activities carried out by 
large organizations.
 
Services are often made up of a group of component services, some of which 
may also have component services.
You can think of an accounting department, for example, as providing a 
service to other departments, to the executive board, and also to the share-
holders. You can consider what an accounting department does as a single 
service, and from the auditing perspective, you probably should. But you 
can also consider an accounting department to be a collection of services 
because it contains multiple distinct activities: accounts receivable, general 
ledger, and so on. You can view each activity as being a component service.
Inputs and outputs
The delivery of a service usually involves a request that initiates the delivery 
of the service and the processing of a set of inputs that delivers the desired 
outputs. Figure 2-2, which looks extremely simple but masks a fair amount of 
complexity, illustrates this process.
 
Figure 2-2: 
A service 
with inputs 
and outputs.

Service
Services of all kinds can be very immersive (meaning that you become part 
of the process) or not particularly immersive (meaning that the process hap-
pens without your interaction). Visiting an automated teller machine (ATM) 
to get money, for example, isn’t particularly immersive because the customer 
activity is very simple. The customer requests the service by inserting her 
card into the ATM. The only other inputs that the customer provides are a 
personal identification number (PIN), entered for the sake of security, and 
information about the amount of money required. The ATM checks to see 
whether the customer is entitled to withdraw money and delivers the money 
with a receipt.

18
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
The whole transaction probably takes less than a minute, and the customer 
isn’t exposed to any of the complexities that make such a service possible. 
The service is simple, and it works as long as the customer performs the cus-
tomer activities and the provider performs the provider activities under an 
agreed-to set of rules.
Now contrast this example with being taken to a hospital with appendicitis, 
having an appendectomy, and then recovering in a hospital room. Clearly, 
this service is highly immersive, and the customer is thoroughly exposed to 
a great deal of the activity that delivers the service. In this example, the cus-
tomer for the service is also one of the inputs to the service. The same is true 
of other services, such as providing training to a group of people to increase 
their skills in some way.
 
Services, as we define them, always transform something, and they complete 
by delivering an output, whether that output is cash from your bank account 
or relief from appendicitis.
Assets and tools
You may wonder why we choose to use the symbol of a building to contain 
the elements of a service in Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2, earlier in this chapter. 
Our intention is to provide an impression of a space in which a service is car-
ried out. Every service is carried out somewhere, perhaps in a collection of 
places, and it may even be distributed around the world via a process involv-
ing many call centers and computers.
You use essentially three types of assets and tools to deliver a service:
 
✓ Work environments (buildings)
 
✓ Mechanical tools (vehicles)
 
✓ Digital tools (computers and communications devices)
What assets and tools have in common is that they all cost money and need 
to be maintained — and possibly replaced — over time. Digital tools are 
devoted primarily to collecting and managing information, whereas mechani-
cal tools are related primarily to manipulating or moving things, and the envi-
ronment is the space within which the activity takes place.
If you think of a very complex service, such as providing a passenger flight 
from one place to another, you see that the assets and tools are highly 
diverse, involving airports (including hangars and runways) as well as call 
centers and offices in many places. The associated machinery is complicated, 

19
 Chapter 2: Getting Inside Service Management
too, given the engineering and logistical support that an airplane needs. The 
computer and communications systems also are complex.
Neither could we claim that our example of an ATM service is simple in this 
respect. The service is simple enough at the interface — the card goes in 
and the money comes out — but as we show in Chapter 1, an array of com-
plex information technology (IT) systems is involved in making the service 
happen.
A standardized process model
Every process, from tying your shoelaces to sending astronauts to the 
moon, involves an activity-based workflow. Processes are sometimes newly 
invented. Gold-medal Olympian Dick Fosbury, for example, invented the 
Fosbury Flop, an original technique for executing the high jump that changed 
the way that the event is executed today. Most of the time, though, the ele-
ments that compose processes evolve, improving to some degree over time.
Even the simplest of services has to be managed as a process. The process 
flow may be stated explicitly and documented somewhere, or it may not be. 
It may influence the way that assets and tools are deployed, or it may not. It 
may demand that staff members be trained to understand how it works, or 
the process may be obvious. All these factors can vary.
Figure 2-3 depicts the process model as a flow diagram, representing the 
proper activity for taking the inputs of a service and transforming them into 
desired outcomes.

We can describe the ATM cash withdrawal service in a standardized process 
model by showing the input (the ATM user inserts the card and enters the 
requested information), the process (the ATM verifies the PIN against encoded 
information on the card and checks the amount of money requested against 
data in the user’s bank account), and the output (the ATM dispatches money).

20
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
If we include all the surrounding management activities that support the 
service, however, the process model is more complicated. In this case, the 
model has to include the activities of various support systems throughout 
the bank’s network, such as check depositing and check clearing, as well as 
the scheduling of security personnel to deliver money to the ATM at various 
times as the machine begins to run short.
The more complicated model shows that some of the activities are actually 
defined as computer programs that automate part of the service (such as the 
process that debits the money from the ATM user’s account). The whole pro-
cess is built and automated to work with very little intervention from human 
beings, and the part of the process model that describes what human beings 
have to do is very simple.
After you clearly define a service, you have to work through how you’ll 
manage that service. The process model describes how the service is deliv-
ered. Service management describes how you’ll manage the service, address-
ing such questions as these:
 
✓ How will you keep track of the configuration of the service?
 
✓ How will you manage changes to the service?
 
✓ How will you manage incidents that may occur?
 
✓ How will you monitor the service?
 
✓ How will you manage requests related to the service?
 
For all repeated services, a process is employed to carry out the service, and a 
set of service management processes is used to manage the service.
Skilled participants
The most flexible part of most services is the staff. To carry out their work, 
the members of the staff must have the following traits:
 
✓ Good judgment
 
✓ Intelligence
 
✓ Proper skills
 
✓ Knowledge of their roles
 
✓ Flexibility
The activity of automating service of any kind involves automating the pre-
dictable and repeating elements of it, leaving the exceptional cases to the 
people who are involved.

21
 Chapter 2: Getting Inside Service Management
In most services of any size, the staff members who deliver the service have 
specific roles that involve them in specific activities. In many instances, they 
need to be trained in specific skills, and they were hired because they have 
the requisite intelligence and judgment.
In many circumstances, although a standardized process is in place, it’s 
almost wholly enshrined in the knowledge of the person who’s carrying out 
the task. In fact, many services have two information systems: the computer 
system and the skilled staff members who deliver the service.
Seeing the Importance of Oversight
We think of the oversight system (or service management system) as record-
ing all the information about the service or any aspect of the service that can 
be useful in any way. Thus, the oversight system may refer to the standard-
ized process model to gather measurements about the speed of any given 
activity or the speed of flow from one activity to another. It may take read-
ings from sensors embedded in machinery or from programs that monitor 
the activity of computer systems, and it may take information directly from 
the skilled participants who carry out the service.
This book is about service management, but our model of a service currently 
includes nothing that relates to managing the service. We address that prob-
lem in Figure 2-4 by adding the element of oversight.

22
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
As far as oversight is concerned, you shouldn’t think simply in terms of com-
puter systems gathering and analyzing information. You also need to include 
physical systems, such as the fire-alarm system that’s deployed throughout 
the working space, the central heating system, or even a nuclear power plant.
The point is that for most services, many individual oversight systems 
operate within the overall service management system, contributing to the 
proper performance of the service, but you should have most interest in the 
oversight systems that provide feedback to those who carry out the service. 
Oversight systems that provide feedback on how efficiently the service is 
running are especially useful to the people or computers that carry out the 
service. Their primary role is to ensure that the service is delivered at a level 
that is acceptable to the service user.
Balancing the Physical 
World and IT Systems
Take a moment to review Figure 2-1, earlier in this chapter. In this section, we 
discuss that figure from the service management point of view.
The first thing to note is that service management doesn’t concern itself only 
with what we think of traditionally as computer and communications sys-
tems. Information technology is now embedded inside most assets that in the 
past may not have been thought of as IT assets. In fact, an increasingly blurry 
line divides enterprise physical assets (such as buildings, furniture, landline 
phones, and security systems) and IT assets (servers, laptops, and mobile 
devices) as all assets become increasingly smart, interconnected, and instru-
mented by design.
Physical and IT systems
Although many of us think about managing computers and communications 
systems, this example is only the tip of the iceberg. Service management 
really looks to manage physical environments (plants, facilities, trucks, and 
so on) as well as IT systems, and it defines processes, functions, and roles for 
people. In our ATM example, we aren’t talking just about IT technology. The 
ATM service also relies on trucks, the people who replenish the cash, and the 
paper on which receipts are printed.

23
 Chapter 2: Getting Inside Service Management
When you examine the mission-critical activities of your organization, you 
usually discover that computer systems play a central role. As far as this dis-
covery is concerned, we have good news and bad news:
 
✓ The good news is that IT service management involves similar activities, 
no matter what the various technology and systems are doing.
 
✓ The bad news is that service management is, in many ways, a complex 
and highly skilled activity.
Luckily, businesses have been using IT (including computers, applications, 
networks, storage devices, and security firewalls) for decades, and in doing 
so, they’ve accumulated a mass of experience and a wealth of assets. The 
experience that businesses have accumulated spans all these areas; more 
important, more physical assets are transforming into IT assets with the 
inclusion of smart chips and sensors that allow them to be managed as IT 
assets. An explosion of computerization or smartening of dumb assets is 
occurring, allowing service management to control the broad set of assets 
more easily and adding complexity to what were once simple applications, 
systems, and networks.
Service best practices
The service management experience is embodied to a great extent in the 
hundreds of thousands of computer professionals who run the systems. 
The assets include a wide range of software that’s purpose-built to assist in 
service management. Much of this software has evolved over many years. 
In addition, we have standardized process models and best practices for 
service management, such as the Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library (ITIL), the enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM), and Control 
Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT). (For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 4.) Any organization that needs to consider implement-
ing or changing the way that it manages the services it delivers can leverage 
these resources to augment its service management planning.
Service delivery and oversight
In this chapter, we consider only the internal operation of a service. A service 
has inputs and outcomes, involves the use of tools and assets in a specific 
environment, and is carried out by skilled participants who implement a stan-
dardized process model, and the whole environment is subject to the over-
sight of the service management system.

24
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
What we haven’t done is discuss the nature of that oversight and what it 
involves in detail, but you’ve probably deduced that it involves service man-
agement. The notions of both service and service management are critical. 
The staff members who deliver a service take pride in their activities and 
also seek to improve their efficiency so as to make the service better over 
time. In addition to the delivery of the service, many activities are required to 
manage the service. You need to consider the following questions:
 
✓ How will you plan and manage changes to the service?
 
✓ How will you monitor service levels and service costs?
 
✓ How will you manage incidents that may occur?
 
✓ How will you manage the availability and continuity of the service in the 
event of a major unplanned disruption?
 
✓ How will you manage the security of information within the service?
 
✓ How will you direct, evaluate, and monitor compliance with required 
regulations or polices?
 
✓ How will you manage exceptions?
Service management needs to be effective to answer these questions, but in 
the end, the execution of the service itself must be done in such a way that 
the customer finds the outcomes to be valuable, convenient, and correctly 
priced.

Chapter 3
The Customer Is King
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what the target and customer want
▶ Viewing a service from the outside
▶ Delving into service management
▶ Using services as components of other services
W
e look at a service from the inside in Chapter 2, so it seems logical 
that in this chapter, we take a look at a service from the outside. In 
Chapter 2, we focus on the first part of the definition of a service (a service is 
a purposeful activity); in this chapter, we focus on the second part (carried out 
for the benefit of a known target).
We could say for the benefit of the customer, but we don’t. In most circum-
stances, satisfying the customer isn’t the only driver that shapes a service. If 
the service is delivered by a public company, for example, you also need to 
satisfy the shareholders. You can quite easily make the customers happy and 
still go out of business, and the shareholders are unlikely to approve such a 
business strategy. So in addition to executing the activities of a well-defined 
service in a high-quality manner, service management needs to include both 
a customer satisfaction process and a stakeholder-requirements management 
process to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are known and managed.
So when we say for the benefit of a known target, we may be talking about a 
need to satisfy multiple targets, each of which has a specific expectation of 
the service. The shareholders care about profitability, whereas the custom-
ers care about the quality of service.

26
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
Understanding Customers’ Expectations
The most important thing to understand about customer expectations is that 
they’re defined by context. If you want to deliver an appropriate service, you 
need to satisfy the expectations of the customer. Like most people, you’ve 
probably been to expensive restaurants and also to fast-food joints, for 
example. Although you were the same person in both types of restaurants, 
you definitely weren’t the same customer. At an expensive restaurant, you 
expected excellent service, an intriguing menu, a wine list, a pleasant envi-
ronment, and so on. At a fast-food joint, you expected swift service and pre-
dictable food.
As customers, people are defined by their expectations. Thus, if you want 
to deliver an appropriate service, you need to satisfy the customers’ 
expectations.
Consider an automated teller machine (ATM) transaction. ATM customers’ 
expectations are very easy to define. Customers expect the ATM to work 
properly, dispense money in a reasonable amount of time, and keep their 
financial data secure. Customers don’t really care how an ATM accomplishes 
these tasks as long as it works the way they expect it to. As far as they’re 
concerned, the ATM can involve a vast integrated computer and communi-
cations system, or someone could be hiding inside the machine with a wad 
of bills, pushing them out of the slot when requested. Both systems are the 
same as far as the customer is concerned; how the service is achieved is 
irrelevant.
Another important aspect is selection. Customers either select a service 
or have no choice. A person entering the United States through an airport, 
for example, is stopped by the U.S. Customs Service. The customer in this 
instance can’t say, “I don’t think I like this customs service; I’ll use Canada’s 
instead.” The fact that the U.S. Customs Service has a monopoly at all U.S. 
borders, however, doesn’t prevent it from wanting to provide unobtrusive 
service to innocent travelers while preventing banned substances and smug-
glers from entering the country.
 
The expectations of the customer are defined primarily by context.
Looking at a Service from the Outside
The customer of a service sees only the external view of the service interface, 
as shown in Figure 3-1.

The
service
Although the service may have many inputs and outputs, the customer is 
directly aware of only the outcomes provided directly by the service and the 
inputs (such as a security code) she provided, along with the service request 
(such as the amount of money she wants to withdraw).
Suppose that you take your shoes to a cobbler and tell him what’s wrong 
with them. Later, you collect the shoes, and you judge the level of service pri-
marily by whether the cobbler mended the shoes effectively.
In this situation, the cobbler managing the service probably focuses on the 
quality of workmanship and the time taken to complete the work. Unless he 
measures factors such as customer satisfaction, transaction trends, pricing 
trends, and margin trends, however, he’ll have no idea whether he’s deliver-
ing the appropriate service level based on both customer and stakeholder 
requirements.
 
In evaluating service quality, measurements of customers’ and stakeholders’ 
satisfaction are the most important.
If the cobbler pays special attention only to the quality of the work, he may 
be investing in the wrong thing. Perhaps he has a good location filled with 
wealthy customers and no nearby competitors, so he may be able to spend 
more time on repairs and charge more without driving away customers. If his 
method of providing service is sustainable, he needs to gather information 
from his customers. If he’s going to be successful, he needs to discover the 
key factors that will satisfy his customers. On the other hand, if the cobbler 
measures only the customer experience and fails to track progress on stake-
holder requirements, he may go out of business. He may spend so much time 
or charge so much for each shoe repair that his customers would have been 
better off buying new shoes.

28
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
Understanding Service Management
Service management is
The management of a service to ensure that it meets the critical out-
comes the customer values and the stakeholders want to provide.
Before we go any further, we need to distinguish between the execution of a 
service and service management. The execution of a service is the process of 
performing the task, whereas service management is the process of making 
sure that the task is performed according to expectations.
An ATM is a good example of a service because the service outcomes desired 
by the customer and stakeholders are simple and not subject to debate. The 
customer wants quick, accurate, secure, affordable, and always-available ser-
vice transactions, and the stakeholders want seamless delivery of the service 
at an affordable price with the right level of oversight.
Those features are all that the customer — we’ll call her Jane — expects, but 
her expectations actually are high. Jane expects the ATM to be available 24/7, 
to be free of errors, and to be fast. If she turns up at an ATM at 4 a.m. and the 
ATM isn’t working, she’s much more likely to get annoyed and curse the bank 
than to think, “After all, it’s 4 a.m. Perhaps I was optimistic in expecting to get 
money at this time of day.”
As far as ATM service is concerned, the critical customer service needs are 
well understood. Ever since ATMs were introduced, customers have had high 
service expectations, and because banks can save money and even gener-
ate revenue by deploying ATMs, financial institutions are willing to make the 
investment to deliver the quality of service that customers demand.
In fact, the ATM service was highly automated from the get-go, and even at 
the outset, the level of automation was such that the service was delivered 
primarily by purpose-built computers and communications technology.
The assets and tools that are involved in providing the ATM service include 
the ATM devices, the secure communications links from the ATM to the 
bank’s data centers, the applications that manage customer checking 
accounts, the systems that manage cash distribution, the bank’s customer 
support center, and the processes for recording lost or stolen cards. (For 
more information on how assets and tools fit into the service management 
model, refer to Chapter 2.)
The service management systems monitor the ATM’s service systems to prevent 
those systems from failing and affecting customers’ service expectations. 

29
 Chapter 3: The Customer Is King
A system isn’t necessarily made up only of technology. A typical system, 
in fact, is made up of people, processes, technologies, and information. In 
addition to the service management system, service providers need good 
governance to minimize performance declines during periods of change and 
innovation.
 
Service management systems are the systems that support the systems that 
deliver the service.
Dealing with the Commercial Reality
To keep customers satisfied, you need to identify key service performance 
indicators as well as key goal indicators — and monitor them closely so that 
you meet both customers’ and stakeholders’ expectations, as illustrated in 
Figure 3-2.

The important point is that in most situations, clear commercial constraints 
apply. The service provider has costs, and as the service level delivered 
increases, so do the costs of delivering the service. The role of the key ser-
vice performance indicators is to set the acceptable service level so that the 
level of customer satisfaction is high. Then you can optimize the delivery of 
the service so that you deliver the highest service level at the lowest cost.

30
Part I: Introducing Service Management 
You mustn’t lose sight of the customer, however. The customer also has 
costs (the price he pays for the service) and service expectations. Because 
we live in a competitive world, the customer’s service expectation probably 
won’t always be the same. Most likely, the customer will expect to get more 
for his money as time passes.
To optimize your outcome over time, you need to monitor customers’ expec-
tations on an ongoing basis; simply assuming that current service goals will 
remain static isn’t good enough. The situation is dynamic, and when cus-
tomers’ expectations change, the service provider needs to recognize and 
respond to the changes.
To achieve this goal, measure both performance and desired outcomes. You 
can measure customers’ expectations by conducting customer feedback sur-
veys and by monitoring customer responses to changes in price or other fac-
tors that affect the delivery of services. Companies use a variety of traditional 
surveys and Web-based monitoring tools to measure sales and customer rela-
tionship effectiveness and to keep track of performance at many levels. You 
must measure service activities for aspects such as cost, duration, human 
effort, and quality. You also need to measure progress toward the outcomes 
that both the customer and the stakeholders had in mind when the service 
was established.
Gaining Control of Services 
and Service Components
If you want to optimize a service, you have to optimize the whole service 
rather than each individual service component. In the ATM example, there’s 
little point in ensuring that the ATM is always well stocked with money if the 
system that provides information about the customers’ bank balances fails. 
You have to optimize the ensemble of services holistically.
The activities that deliver a service usually can be broken into multiple other 
activities. You can consider each of these component services to be a service 
in its own right, in which case it also has a customer. The customer for each 
component service isn’t the ultimate customer of the whole service, however, 
but simply the receiver of its outputs.
This relationship gets very complicated. If you consider an ATM service, 
you can envisage a whole set of coordinated component services, such as 
the marketing of certificates of deposit (CDs) and the provision of insurance 
forms. Suppose that the marketing department of ABC Financial has added 

31
 Chapter 3: The Customer Is King
some new screens to the ATM and that each screen is backed by a new com-
ponent service. The two component services — marketing CDs and providing 
insurance forms — are actual services that a human teller might provide, and 
the ATM has been programmed to provide a form of these services as well. 
The consumer receives the outputs and benefits by getting answers to ques-
tions immediately rather than waiting to speak with a teller.
The same is true for service providers and consumers. Customers have 
customers who have customers. Suppliers have suppliers who have suppli-
ers. The extent of the service management system almost reverberates into 
eternity. Individual people both give and receive service all day long, and it’s 
human nature to worry about the part of the service management system 
that you control. In today’s complex world, however, you also need to care 
about the connections among services and the dependencies among ser-
vices. In other words, if your supplier takes a risk, it’s your risk too.
Consider the activity or service of delivering cash to the ATM. The ATM has 
a defined service to dispense cash. A key performance indicator (KPI) for this 
service component includes delivery of the right amount of cash within an 
acceptable time frame. This activity is only a piece of the whole picture, 
however; additional services fill out the full set of activities. The security of 
the transaction, for example, is imperative to the ATM service as a whole, 
and the security service has its own set of KPIs. Therefore, the entire ATM 
service to customers incorporates a whole set of KPIs, as illustrated in 
Figure 3-3. This situation is true for all other component services. 
Consequently, if the KPIs for the whole service change, you also need to 
adjust the component KPIs.

To optimize a service, you have to optimize the whole service across all inter-
dependent component services. Optimizing select components out of context 
isn’t enough.

S
tandards and best practices have been developed for 
service management just as they have for many other 
aspects of IT and business. In this part, we discuss the

ment reference. We also describe a strategic approach to

Chapter 4
Service Management Standards 
and Best Practices
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the importance of standards and best practices
▶ Discovering standard process models
▶ Obtaining standards certification
T
he definition of service is expansive, ranging from providing service 
in a restaurant to delivering cash to a banking customer through an 
automated teller machine (ATM); it even includes digital services, such as 
sensors included in many automobiles to aid in repair and maintenance ser-
vices. That definition provides for a lot of services that need to be managed. 
Services aren’t just hidden within a company’s own environment; rather, they 
have to be managed across everything from the supply chain to the product 
design partners. Because these services are so important to how well compa-
nies run, more and more services are being implemented based on best prac-
tices and standards for service management.
Organizations need to control, manage, and continuously improve services 
without always having to re-create what works and what doesn’t work. By 
leveraging standards and best practices, organizations can manage services 
more effectively and efficiently than they could otherwise.
In this chapter, we explore the world of service management best practices 
and standards. We also describe why companies leverage standards and best 
practices, and we introduce the organizations that create and distribute nec-
essary information about these standards and best practices.

36
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
Understanding What Best Practices 
and Standards Can Do for You
Best practices and standards can help improve quality and control costs. To 
be clear, here’s what we mean by the terms best practices and standards:
 
✓ Best practices are accumulated knowledge that can help people and 
organizations avoid mistakes that others have made. Best practices 
range from recommendations for specific coding specifications to 
descriptions of enterprisewide management processes that have proved 
to be successful. You can find best practices in many ways, including 
industry organization and independent books, training materials, Web 
sites, and blogs, as well as vendor Web sites and consulting practices. 
(For a few best-practices resources, see “Using Standards and Best 
Practices to Improve Quality,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Standards are a core set of common, repeatable best practices and 
protocols that have been agreed on by a business or industry group. 
Typically, vendors, industry user groups, and end users collaborate to 
develop standards based on the broad expertise of a large number of 
stakeholders. Organizations can leverage these standards as a common 
foundation and innovate on top of them.
Best practices and standards provide a starting recipe, appropriate tools, 
required ingredients, and some tips and tricks. Just as an experienced chef 
experiments with and tweaks a recipe, you may find that you need to adapt 
best practices to fit your situation and requirements. Best practices provide 
a starting point for planning, as well as a common language and set of con-
cepts that enable you to communicate and coordinate with possibly large 
teams without having to communicate the basic approach for the task at 
hand. Being freed from always having to start with the basics, you can focus 
on the innovation that can transform the current environment into something 
special.
Making use of standards that other people in your industry have evaluated, 
tested, and refined may seem to be an obvious approach. Using standards is 
the best way to cut down on errors and get results quickly — but many busi-
nesses don’t follow this approach. Some companies are reluctant to imple-
ment standards because they see themselves as being unique, with highly 
differentiated sets of business processes. When your business makes a com-
mitment to identifying processes that are consistent with those of other com-
panies in similar markets, however, you can take advantage of best practices 
for these processes. This important step frees resources that you can use to 
improve processes that support areas of real differentiation.

37
 Chapter 4: Service Management Standards and Best Practices
Using Standards and Best Practices 
to Improve Quality
Not surprisingly, many organizations help companies implement best prac-
tices. International, national, local, and industry-specific professional associa-
tions provide forums for managers to gather and discuss lessons learned and 
best practices. Here are a few sources for standards and best practices from 
leading organizations:
 
✓ Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL): ITIL provides a 
set of best practices for IT service management. You can find more infor-
mation at www.itil-officialsite.com/home/home.asp.
 
✓ International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO has devel-
oped more than 17,000 international standards, including standards for 
IT service management and corporate governance of information tech-
nology. You can find more information at www.iso.org.
 
✓ enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM): eTOM is a framework that 
provides a business process model for the telecommunications industry. 
Find out more at www.tmforum.org/BusinessProcessFramework/
1647/home.html.
 
✓ Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT): 
COBIT provides an IT framework with a focus on governance and manag-
ing technical and business risks. You can find more information at www.
isaca.org/cobit.
 
✓ eSourcing Capability Model (eSCM): eSCM is a framework developed 
at Carnegie Mellon University to provide a best-practices model for 
improving relationships between customers and suppliers in out-
sourcing agreements. Find out more at Carnegie Mellon’s IT Services 
Qualification Center (ITSqc) Web site, http://itsqc.cmu.edu/
models/index.asp.
 
✓ Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI): The Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University developed 
CMMI along with members of industry and government. CMMI is a 
process-improvement best practice used to improve processes in a 
project or overall. Find out more at www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi.
If you’re looking for more information, don’t worry. In “Finding Standards,” 
later in this chapter, we give you a list of the details.
 
One of the greatest benefits of the organizations that provide standards and 
best practices is that they enable people who have specialized knowledge to 

38
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
exchange information about lessons learned. Therefore, these organizations 
can provide forums and create documents that are very helpful in preventing 
mistakes.
As markets and industries change, best practices are updated. Formal sets 
of documented best practices have input from major universities, product 
and service providers, commercial consultants, educators, and organizations 
from every industry sector. When these collections of best practices are pub-
lished, they provide significant value because they show what many people 
with different and sometimes conflicting business objectives can agree on.
Why are we talking about this topic in the context of service management? 
The reason is quite simple, actually: Standardization drives commoditization 
and changes the focus to innovation and differentiation. When you follow 
agreed-on industry standards for connecting to networks, systems, and serv-
ers, for example, you’re free to focus on service innovation. As agreements 
on standards for network protocols change, the focus of innovation changes 
to the types of services that travel over the network. This model seems to be 
very basic but has profound implications for service management. As service 
management processes become standardized, the focus of innovation turns 
to service.
On a different level, organizations are starting to see that they can standard-
ize management processes. As this standardization happens, organizations 
can respond to changing market conditions more quickly without recon-
structing all the pieces they may need.
 
Using standards and best practices alone doesn’t guarantee quality results. 
You need to apply standards and best practices with thoughtful care, experi-
ence, and knowledge. You can’t assume that your processes will be optimized 
just because you send the members of your IT team to get certified in their 
understanding of accepted best practices and standards, for example.
By now, you may be thinking, “I get it. Standards and best practices are 
important.” And you probably have a few questions to ask, such as these:
 
✓ Why are some companies reluctant to use standards and best 
practices?
 
 Some businesses think that they won’t benefit from applying industry 
best practices for certain projects, even if staff members have been 
certified in those best practices recently. One common reason for staff 
members to refrain from implementing standards and best practices 
relates to the uniqueness of complex standards. Understandably, a busi-
ness owner may feel that the highly specialized nature of the business 

39
 Chapter 4: Service Management Standards and Best Practices
makes it hard to benefit from best practices that have been honed in 
other businesses. Many companies, however, find that they can leverage 
best practices as a starting point and make adjustments so that the spe-
cifics of the business are taken into account.
 
✓ Who is most likely to benefit from using standards and best practices?
 
 Your company! Standards and best practices can become the foundation 
for implementing service management and help your organization meet 
expectations.
 
✓ How do companies get started?
 
 If you’re a new user, or if you’re inexperienced in certain business pro-
cesses, a standards-and-best-practices approach can be an excellent 
way to get started. Standards and best practices can provide a frame-
work for you to follow. Also, following standards and best practices 
helps you check on how well you’re doing.
Finding Standards
Although following a best-practices approach may seem to be logical, 
many companies find roadblocks that keep them from choosing this path. 
Organizations know that they need to develop a strategy to implement and 
manage services, but they can easily get sidetracked by concentrating on 
immediate project needs rather than the big picture. Operations must work 
in tandem with the business to provide a quality management system for 
business services, which are critical to business success.
The sections that follow provide an overview of the most widely used service 
management standards and best practices. ITIL, for example, is the most 
broadly accepted set of best practices for IT operations. As its use spread, 
the organizing body increased its comprehensiveness, so ITIL now covers 
just about everything related to services in general. Other widely accepted 
best practices and standards are ISO, eTOM, COBIT, eSCM, and CMMI.
ITIL
The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of books 
that describes best practices for service management. Today, ITIL contrib-
utes some best practices — very well-tested practices — that become the 
frameworks for improving service quality. These best practices are codified 

40
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
in books that can be purchased from ITIL. The most recent version, Version 3, 
consists of five core books that describe best practices for service manage-
ment. These books focus on service strategy, service design, service transi-
tion, service operation, and continuous service improvement. As you can 
see by the book titles, ITIL Version 3 takes a life-cycle approach to service 
management.
ITIL’s knowledge gathering and documentation began back in the 1980s, 
when a group of people working for the United Kingdom’s government 
assessed the quality of government IT services. They found that the quality 
was not up to their expectations. Although the technology executives were 
very good at their jobs, it was common practice for them to move around to 
different positions quite a bit. The resulting lack of continuous leadership led 
to some major challenges in providing consistent and high-quality results for 
technology projects.
To improve quality, the UK government decided to outsource many of its IT 
projects. Using outside consultants had its own challenges, and service qual-
ity continued to deteriorate. To keep the outside consultants in sync with the 
internal IT departments, IT methodically began to record all the best prac-
tices surrounding IT strategy, design, development, operations, and mainte-
nance. This very comprehensive set of practices for IT projects became the 
basis for ITIL. The framework was picked up by government and nongovern-
ment agencies in the UK and globally.
ITIL Version 2 (also known as V2), released in 2001, consists of seven core 
books that took a processcentric approach to service management. The 
focus of V2 is on improving processes such as service support, service deliv-
ery, security management, and infrastructure management.
Over time, V2 needed revision because best practices changed. Many ITIL 
projects focused on processes being developed in isolation without a focus 
on the services to be managed. Service management requires addressing 
both service and the service management processes to achieve the value that 
the business needs. Processes shouldn’t be viewed as being new stand-alone 
sets of requirements; they have to be understood in context of the overall 
business strategy. Version 3 (V3), released in 2007, expands on earlier ver-
sions and provides a service-focused approach with an emphasis on integra-
tion and producing value from assets.
So whereas the first version of ITIL focuses on managing systems and V2 
focuses on management processes, V3 focuses on services and the activities 
that need to occur throughout the service life cycle to produce the maximum 
value from all business and IT assets.

41
 Chapter 4: Service Management Standards and Best Practices
One of the fundamental shifts between V2 and V3 makes very clear that if 
you wait until service delivery to think about managing service levels, you’re 
too late. You need to begin planning for service levels during service design. 
V3 emphasizes the need for integrating everything — processes, services, 
people, tools, and information — and the need for collaboration among differ-
ent parts of IT. Many of the processes and best practices from V2 are still rel-
evant and are covered in V3, but ITIL has matured, and the best practices of 
V2 are given more of a strategic enterprise view in V3. Also, the relationships 
between IT and the business are clearer and better defined in V3.
ISO
As you may well know, no global boundaries exist in business anymore. The 
Internet helped eliminate barriers to entry for tiny businesses in remote 
locations. Now, as long as tiny businesses have reliable Internet connec-
tions and workable e-commerce applications, they can operate on a global 
level. So it seems logical that representatives from countries all over the 
world should get together and agree on international standards for business. 
These standards are the responsibility of the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO), coordinated by representatives in Switzerland. 
National standards institutes from 157 countries send representatives to ISO. 
Together, the representatives develop and publish international standards 
from the perspective of both business and public needs.
Whereas ITIL was developed and is maintained by the UK government, ISO is 
comprised of international body members with voting rights and has many 
liaison relationships for advice and support. The group isn’t a government 
organization.
ISO has a joint agreement with the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) on standards related to IT and computing. These standards are called 
ISO/IEC standards. Although many ISO and ISO/IEC standards are relevant to 
service management, ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 20000, and ISO/IEC 38500 are the most 
directly relevant. We cover them all in the following sections.
ISO 9001
ISO 9001 is the management system standard for managing both products 
and services, laying out the requirements that an organization needs to meet 
if it wants to have a good quality management system. If your company wants 
a quality management system that is ISO 9001-registered (meaning that it’s 
reviewed by an expert), you should do the following things:

42
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
 
1. Identify the processes required for the production of high-quality 
services.
 
2. Determine the sequences and interactions of these processes.
 
3. Design and document each process.
 
4. Check and analyze the implementation of each process, and continually 
improve the effectiveness of the service management system made up of 
all those processes.
ISO/IEC 20000
ISO/IEC 20000 is an international service management standard that 
describes a core set of auditable service management principles for a lim-
ited set of service management processes. Currently, the ISO and the IEC 
are revising this standard to provide more guidance for a standards-based 
approach to service management processes. Whereas ISO 9001 takes a more 
generic approach, ISO/IEC 20000 provides descriptions of specific manage-
ment processes common within service providers. Whereas ITIL describes 
best practices, ISO/IEC 20000 documents a minimum set of service manage-
ment requirements that every service provider should apply.
ISO/IEC 38500
ISO/IEC 38500 provides a set of principles for the governance of IT services. 
Due to the costs, human effort, and risks associated with the supply and 
demand for IT services and IT-enabled business services, it’s more critical 
than ever to ensure that IT is properly directed and controlled. This standard 
provides guidance to directors and those who advise directors to ensure that 
IT services are well governed.
COBIT
Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) was first 
released in 1996 by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association 
(ISACA) and the IT Governance Institute (ITGI). COBIT’s creators have since 
released many updated versions. In early 2009, COBIT was in its fourth 
version.
COBIT is known for its focus on governance and on managing technical and 
business risks. Its popularity and acceptance increased in 2002 after the U.S. 
government passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. But COBIT isn’t as widely used 
as some other standards, even though the publications are available without 
charge at www.isaca.org.
The COBIT framework includes six documents on management, tool sets, 
control objectives, and guidelines for auditing. COBIT has been mapped to 

43
 Chapter 4: Service Management Standards and Best Practices
other standards, including ITIL and ISO, both of which are covered earlier in 
this chapter. ISACA and ITGI provide globally accepted practices for IT gover-
nance (the management system required to direct and control IT) and other 
valuable guidance.
Maturity model and other models 
for service management
Another type of best practice is available for 
service management. All the models men-
tioned in the “Finding Standards” section of 
this chapter focus on best practices as things 
that are either done or not done. This other type 
of best practice is a maturity model, which is a 
road map that an organization may follow in its 
service management journey. Each stage of the 
road map represents a new level of expertise 
and experience in operational development, 
as well as the organization’s relationships with 
customers, partners, and suppliers.
The ISO, various universities, and commercial 
service providers offer versions of maturity 
models. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 
particular has established various maturity 
model best practices designed for assessment 
and certification. CMU’s Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI) and its IT Services Qualification 
Center (ITSqc) have both produced sets 
of maturity-model best practices. CMMI 
(Capability Maturity Model Integration), also 
developed by Carnegie Mellon, is a Capability 
Maturity Model (CMM) for software engineer-
ing. The latest version includes both a staged 
model approach and a continuous model. The 
staged model is based on improving the overall 
management capability of all processes collec-
tively, in five stages or levels of maturity. The 
continuous model is based on improving the 
maturity of each management process individu-
ally. Some processes may be more mature than 
others, depending on business need.
ITSqc has developed a service management 
capability model called eSCM (eSourcing 
Capability Model). The term eSourcing refers 
to outsourced services of IT-enabled busi-
ness processes and business services. This 
model has been developed specifically to cer-
tify IT-enabled service providers that recog-
nize their different capabilities. One provider 
may apply best practices to only one account, 
whereas another can apply best practices 
to many accounts. eSCM is different from a 
maturity model, which is based on the idea that 
a management capability or process may be 
done in various levels of maturity, from poorly 
to well.
The ITSqc Capability Model is focused on rec-
ognizing different types of capability. Another 
interesting aspect of the eSCM is that it recog-
nizes that a service is an active collaboration 
between provider and client and that value is an 
act of co-creation. This model provides details 
on practices that clients should employ to get 
the most from their sourcing relationships.
In the future, you’ll see even more maturity 
models. It appears that various universities 
are developing additional service management 
maturity models, for example. ISO/IEC also 
plans to produce more service management 
standards: a maturity model, an incremental 
conformity model, and a process-reference 
model standard. With all this activity going 
on, service management organizations have 
a great need to understand the models’ real 
value — and where those models do and don’t 
add value to their business objectives.

44
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
eTOM
The enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) is designed to provide a 
business-process model or framework for the telecommunications industry. 
eTOM describes enterprise processes required by a service provider. You 
can analyze them based on their significance to the business. For suppliers, 
eTOM outlines potential boundaries of software components to align with the 
customers’ needs, and it highlights the required functions, inputs, and out-
puts that products must support. Like ITIL and COBIT, eTOM contains many 
concepts that benefit all service providers.
One interesting aspect of eTOM is its view of services as products. This view 
is aligned with the ISO 9001 perspective on common requirements in qual-
ity management system products and services. eTOM provides prescriptive 
guidance for applying the ISO 9001 concept of a quality management system 
to a telecommunications service provider.
eTOM, like COBIT and ITIL, is going through continuous improvement. 
Currently, the TM Forum (the organization that publishes eTOM) is evaluat-
ing some of ITIL V3’s best practices for inclusion.
Getting Certified
Certification is an important part of any discussion of service management 
because certification implies a certain level of expertise. Here are a few basic 
things that you need to know about certification:
 
✓ Types of certification: You can choose among three types of certifica-
tion, according to your needs:
 
• Personal certifications validate a candidate’s understanding of 
specific terms and concepts.
 
• Professional certifications indicate that a person can prove both 
knowledge and experience in a topic.
 
• Organizational certifications validate an organization’s methods, 
proving that it does something in a reliable way.
 
✓ Certification versus standard: You should understand the difference 
between the certification and the body of knowledge or standard with 
which it is associated. ISO/IEC 20000, for example, is a documented stan-
dard for service management. Some certification schemes are designed 

45
 Chapter 4: Service Management Standards and Best Practices
to validate whether ISO/IEC 20000 principles have been implemented in 
practice in a service provider.
 
✓ Value of certification: The value of a certification is tied directly to the 
value that the market associates with it. The standard or best practice 
may be very beneficial, whereas a certification may or may not have 
market value.
Education is one of the most important aspects of getting on the right path 
to implementing standards and best practices. Many of the standards and 
best-practices bodies have extensive education and personal certification 
programs that allow you to become proficient in your understanding of their 
standards.
ITIL has a very extensive personal certification program. The V2 series of 
certificates includes the Foundation Certificate, the Practitioner’s Certificate, 
the Clustered Practitioner’s Certificate, and the Manager’s Certificate. The 
V3 certification program includes a Foundation Certificate, a choice of five 
Lifecycle Stage Certificates or five Capability Certificates, and an ITIL Expert 
Certificate. The certification courses teach you about ITIL’s language and 
terms. The programs provide information about the philosophy of ITIL ser-
vice management.
The V3 course’s target audience includes employees of IT companies who 
are involved in supporting and delivering IT services, as well as just about 
anyone else who needs to understand ITIL and service management best 
practices.
 
If you’re suffering from certification burnout, it’s okay to learn the knowledge 
and just do your job. Also, the IT industry is increasingly expressing interest 
in professional qualifications that recognize that skills and qualifications are 
acquired outside the classroom as well. Certifications are good, but certifica-
tion plus experience is even better.
 
Getting an ITIL certification isn’t a surefire recipe for success. In fact, taking 
any class on any subject isn’t a surefire recipe for success. Many other factors 
are required for a company to implement standards and best practices for 
service management successfully. We delve deeper into this topic in Chapter 6 
and Chapter 7.

Chapter 5
Implementing ITIL
In This Chapter
▶ Using ITIL V3 as a blueprint for enterprise service management
▶ Considering practical matters in implementing ITIL
▶ Understanding how ITIL integrates with other best-practices frameworks
S
o far in this book, we’ve defined a service, discussed the importance 
of managing a service, and enumerated the value of best practices in 
service management. We’ve also given you a brief overview of some of the 
important public standards and best practices — namely, best-practices 
models such as Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology 
(COBIT) and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM), as well as stan-
dards from the International Standards Organization (ISO). (Refer to Chapter 4 
for more information on these models and organizations.)
In this chapter, we explore in detail one of the most comprehensive 
sets of best practices for service management: Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library (ITIL). We chose ITIL for this discussion in part 
because many of its best practices are now being adopted even beyond IT 
(such as in service provider operations) to help adherents align existing 
services with business objectives; to identify new service opportunities to 
support the business; and to successfully address the closed-loop planning, 
execution, and continuous improvement of these services.
Although ITIL is a set of published guidance books that you can simply down-
load to your computer or view on the Internet (at www.itilsurvival.com/
ITILBooksintheUS.html), implementing ITIL service management best 
practices in your organization isn’t so simple, so we also talk about some 
practical considerations in implementing ITIL. Specifically, we discuss how 
ITIL integrates into other frameworks.

48
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
ITIL V3: A Useful Blueprint for 
Enterprise Service Management
In Chapter 4, we introduce ITIL and tell you a little bit about its history and 
objectives. We explain that ITIL is a library of books that describes best prac-
tices for service management. In 2007, the Office of Government Commerce 
(OGC), a UK agency, introduced the latest version of ITIL: Version 3 (V3). 
This version emphasizes the importance of building best practices through-
out the entire services life cycle because, frankly, if you’ve waited until your 
service is delivered to consider best practices, you’ve waited too long. So 
ITIL V3 emphasizes the need for integrating everything: processes, services, 
people, tools, and information, as well as collaboration among different parts 
of IT.
ITIL V3 consists of five core books that describe these best practices. The 
five books address each aspect of the services life cycle, from developing a 
service strategy to designing the service and then rolling out and operating 
the service. The books also provide guidelines for continually improving your 
services. Within each of these life-cycle areas, a series of 26 best-practices 
components guides you through service management. Many of these best-
practices processes occur throughout all stages of the life cycle. Wow! This 
sounds like a lot of information — and it is. We distill it for you in the follow-
ing sections.
Book 1: Service Strategy
Just as a business needs a strategy, so does IT. Service Strategy addresses 
how to set a strategy to meet customer needs and provide value. Key ele-
ments include strategy guidelines, financial considerations, and portfolio and 
demand management. Here are the highlights:
 
✓ Strategy considerations: IT doesn’t live in a vacuum. To develop a 
strategy, IT needs to align with business objectives that include under-
standing customer needs, the market, and the competitive environment; 
then it must set the vision and direction for IT services in the context 
of the broader corporate strategy. IT also needs to put together a plan 
for achieving this vision, listing the services and products that custom-
ers expect as well as outlining the organizational and sourcing design 
for achieving these goals. Service Strategy defines the different kinds of 
service providers, both internal and external, that are required to make 

49
 Chapter 5: Implementing ITIL
these services a reality. Finally, because a strategy isn’t complete if you 
can’t measure it, Service Strategy provides guidelines for developing key 
performance indicators (KPIs), which are measurements to help track 
how well services meet objectives.
 
✓ Financial management: Setting a strategy is great, but you need to 
make sure that you can pay for it, so ITIL V3 also includes guidelines on 
budgeting, accounting, and charging. It helps you understand how to 
think about the costs and revenue associated with your services, how to 
account for the costs, and how you might charge for the services.
 
✓ Portfolio management: After you deliver the services, you need to 
manage them from a financial perspective to make sure that they address 
business needs. This management includes identifying and validating 
the portfolio of services, as well as monitoring them to ensure that they 
continue to provide value. An automated teller machine (ATM), for 
example, provides several services, but if one of them — say, a stamp-
dispensing service — isn’t what customers want, keeping the service 
running may not be financially viable.
 
✓ Demand management: Your services are useful only if customers want 
them and you can provide them. Imagine what would happen if you 
built a service and found out that consumers no longer demanded it, or 
if consumers demanded the service but you didn’t have the capacity to 
meet the demand.
Service strategy boils down to a simple concept: Transform assets into value. 
Value has two aspects:
 
✓ Assets: First, the provider needs to derive the most value from his assets 
in the form of the products and services provided.
 
✓ Customers: The second aspect of transforming assets to value comes on 
the customer side of service management. The most valuable service a 
provider can offer is one that helps the customer get more value from 
the assets that the customer owns.
The whole Service Strategy concept builds on the core concept of producing 
value from different types of assets. The ability to turn assets to value — 
service management — is a critical business asset.
Book 2: Service Design
According to Service Design, after you set your strategy, it’s time to design 
your services. This design includes dealing with architecture, technology, 

50
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
processes, information, and organizational issues. Service design also 
includes collecting business requirements, as well as designing and develop-
ing appropriate service solutions, processes, and measurement systems. 
Consider these seven critical aspects when you’re designing services:
 
✓ Service-catalog management: To build and operate your services effec-
tively, you need a central registry/repository of information about these 
services: a service catalog. The catalog includes services that you’ve 
already agreed to as well as services requested and provides a view of 
the services offered to those who want to or need to see them. So a good 
catalog provides meaningful views of services to multiple stakeholders: 
customers, users, suppliers, and providers.
 
✓ Service-level management: A service needs to meet customer expecta-
tions, which means that it needs to meet certain service levels. Banking 
customers, for example, expect ATM machines to be available 24/7, so 
a bank needs to make sure that services supporting the delivery of cash 
and other services to customers meet this expectation.
 
✓ Capacity management: If customers desire a service that isn’t available 
because of IT constraints, customer expectations aren’t met. Capacity 
management provides a way to understand whether IT can meet cus-
tomer needs, and it helps you plan accordingly. The data center servic-
ing ATM machines, for example, may need to be staffed at a certain level 
to meet service-level and operational-level agreements, so the bank may 
need to hire and train new staff members, as well as buy new hardware 
and software to support the data center.
 
✓ Availability management: You need to have someone (or a team of 
someones) monitoring the availability, reliability, and maintainability 
of all your services, which is what availability management is all about. 
Ideally, management isn’t simply reactive in terms of measuring what’s 
happening to a service; it’s also proactive in determining what you need 
to do to meet expectations.
 
✓ IT service continuity management: When your business requires high 
IT availability, you need a support structure in place to ensure that 
availability.
 
✓ Information security management: Information makes the world 
go ’round, and securing this information is paramount to effective 
IT services. This best practice is all about ensuring that you include 
information security when you design services, which means includ-
ing information confidentiality, integrity, and availability. When you 
go to your ATM machine, for example, you certainly expect that all 
your account information will remain accurate, complete, timely, and 
confidential.

51
 Chapter 5: Implementing ITIL
 
✓ Supplier and contract management: You need to make sure that all the 
suppliers you hire to support a particular service supply the service at 
the level of expectation the customer needs. If you hire a security com-
pany to deliver money to your ATM machine, and the machine is empty, 
the supplier isn’t meeting its obligations, and your customers won’t be 
happy. To make this service happen, you need to manage supplier con-
tracts effectively.
In general, service design integrates service management best practices early 
in the life cycle. The key concept is that you design and develop a service, 
not just infrastructure or an application. Service design also incorporates the 
ideas of service utility and service warranty. Service utility refers to what the 
service does. In the case of IT services, service utility is often close to the 
key functional attributes of the applications that make up the service. Service 
warranty is the level of service that you offer. What you hand off to opera-
tions to be deployed is a service package, including both the service utility 
and the service warranty. You can’t wait until service delivery to think about 
service-level management, availability, capacity, continuity, and security.
Book 3: Service Transition
The next phase of ITIL’s best practices involves getting the service package 
into operation, which is the topic of the Service Transition book. This book 
covers transitioning all aspects of the service: the technology as well as the 
people and processes.
Imagine that you’ve built the best ATM machine in the world and all the 
supporting technology infrastructure to go along with it. If you don’t have 
the armored-truck drivers, data center operators, and all the other people 
and processes in place to make getting money out of that machine possible, 
everything is for naught.
Service transition requires transferring the knowledge that goes along with 
the services to those who operate them. It also includes processes for deal-
ing with any changes that might occur in the service.
Service Transition includes the following best practices:
 
✓ Change management: It’s okay to make a change in a service, but before 
you do, you need to make sure that certain things happen. If you want to 
change the way that deposits are made at an ATM machine, for example, 
you need to evaluate and authorize these changes. After you authorize 
the changes, you need to record them, and you should also test and 

52
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
validate them to make sure that nothing goes wrong down the road. 
Standard processes are key; otherwise, you’ll never be able to keep 
track of anything.
 
✓ Service asset and configuration management: A lot of IT and non-IT 
assets make up an overall service, and you need to identify and control 
all those assets. Configuration information is the basis for managing any 
service. The best-practices approach is to have an integrated asset and 
configuration system to provide service configuration information to all 
other service management processes. This information enables service 
management to manage both the technical and financial aspects of ser-
vices effectively.
 
✓ Knowledge management: Knowledge management ensures that people 
get the information they need to do their jobs correctly. A service knowl-
edge system is required to make the service management system effec-
tive. People and tools need complex, integrated information to manage 
services. If the data center personnel at the ATM data center don’t have 
the right information to do their jobs, for example, the jobs won’t get 
done efficiently or effectively.
 
✓ Release and deployment management: When you deploy a new service 
or release a new version, do it in a controlled manner, within agreed-on 
service-level constraints, to prevent service incidents.
 
✓ Service evaluation: Evaluate services to ensure that they’re useful.
 
✓ Service validation and testing: As you deploy services in the organization — 
or if you change them — you need to test those services to make sure 
that each one works effectively by itself and with other services. An 
ATM’s new stamp-dispensing service may work well by itself, but if it 
hasn’t been tested with other services, it may interfere with subsequent 
transactions, such as withdrawals.
Service-transition processes balance the need for stable operations with 
stakeholder and customer requirements for innovation and change.
Book 4: Service Operation
The rubber meets the road in Service Operation, where customers begin to 
receive value. When services are up and running, make sure that they con-
tinue to provide value to customers. Service Operation describes several best 
practices to ensure this outcome while you deal with balancing factors such 
as quality of service versus cost of service.

53
 Chapter 5: Implementing ITIL
Service Operation describes five key components:
 
✓ Event management: An event, according to ITIL, is a change of state 
that may indicate that something has gone wrong. An ATM machine 
experiences an event when it runs out of paper and can’t generate a 
receipt, for example. This event is noted, and it may lead to an incident 
or problem (discussed later in this list) or even a change in the system. 
The essence of event management begins with noticing these changes of 
state, and it continues with filtering and correlating to isolate the events 
that you must address to maintain agreed-on service levels.
 
 Event management is a critical bedrock operational process. Without 
event management, you’re relying on customers or staff members to 
notice events. Detecting events before customers discover them — and 
before agreed-on service conditions are breached — helps control both 
the quality and the cost of service.
 
✓ Incident management: An incident, according to ITIL, is an unplanned 
interruption in an IT service. The purpose of incident management, then, 
is to restore the service. When an ATM runs out of paper, for example, 
the incident management follow-up may be to call suppliers that can 
install the receipt slips at the ATM machine. You need to detect, log, 
analyze, resolve, and close all incidents. You need to record all incident 
activity because the record provides a basis for problem management 
analysis (discussed later in this list).
 
✓ Request fulfillment: According to ITIL, a request can be for a change, 
information, or access to an IT service. This request can come from any 
user. In the data center servicing deposits and withdrawals at an ATM, 
for example, a request may be made for a report detailing ATM activity.
 
✓ Problem management: A problem is a condition with an unknown cause. 
If someone takes $100 out of an ATM machine and is debited $200, for 
example, ABC Financial needs to investigate this problem. Problem man-
agement studies past incidents and other information to identify oppor-
tunities to prevent future incidents. By analogy, if incident management 
is a firehouse responding to fires, problem management is the city plan-
ner’s office, which studies all past fires and makes change requests for 
new city ordinances to prevent future fires.
 
✓ Access management: Access management ensures that information is pro-
vided only to authorized users. Only properly identified users with proper 
access authority can see client activity at a given ATM machine, for exam-
ple. Access management also addresses entitlement management, which 
ensures that users have access to services that they’re entitled to access and 
prevents them from accessing services that they aren’t entitled to access.

Book 5: Continual Service Improvement
You can run as many services as you want, but if you aren’t monitoring 
those services to maintain and improve them, chances are that you won’t 
be successful. Remember those KPIs that we discuss as part of developing 
your strategy (refer to “Book 1: Service Strategy,” earlier in this chapter)? 
Well, Continual Service Improvement describes how to collect and analyze 
this information via a seven-step improvement process that puts these KPIs 
into practice. Additionally, the book provides information on the following 
aspects of service improvement:
 
✓ Service measurement: The section provides guidelines on monitoring 
and measuring your services.
 
✓ Service reporting: This section provides guidelines on the kinds of infor-
mation that you should present in reports to help readers understand 
how well the service is performing. The reports can also help you pre-
dict what issues the service may face in the future.
Continual Service Improvement also discusses several important tools and 
techniques for measuring and improving both processes and services.
Practical Considerations 
in Implementing ITIL
As we mention earlier in this chapter, you can’t simply load ITIL onto your 
computer and claim a service management victory. ITIL is about technol-
ogy, people, and processes. If you leave any one of these ingredients out of 
the mix, there’s a good chance that you’ll fail. We discuss how to get started 
implementing a service management strategy like ITIL in the next two chap-
ters. But before we do, we want to point out some practical considerations 
regarding implementing ITIL.
Surprise! Industry pundits have noted some major failures by organizations 
undertaking ITIL implementations. You certainly don’t want to have one of 
those failures. In most cases, failure is due to the fact that organizations jump 
onto the ITIL bandwagon with unrealistic expectations and unclear goals. 
Here are a series of questions you should ask about your company before 
embarking on ITIL:
 
✓ Do we have well-defined business drivers?
 
✓ Do we have well-defined business requirements?

55
 Chapter 5: Implementing ITIL
 
✓ Have we set our priorities?
 
✓ Have we thought about the right-size project to get started with?
 
✓ Do we have committed sponsors?
 
✓ Does good communication exist between business and IT?
 
✓ Do we have effective project management capabilities?
 
✓ Have we thought about governance?
 
✓ Do we have good vendor relationships?
Aside from the five core ITIL books and a willingness to succeed, companies 
should consider the assets and skills they have at their disposal. Successful 
companies also need to have prioritizing and diagnostic techniques to help 
plan and assess where they are and where they want to be with ITIL. In addi-
tion, they need an improvement approach and a governance model. Rather 
than focusing on implementing ITIL, organizations should focus on imple-
menting business-driven service management improvements.
It’s best to implement service management improvements with clearly 
defined phases and milestones — and not bite off more than you can chew. 
Some companies have found it beneficial to work with outside experts to help 
them get started in ITIL. These experts can help educate the team, find out 
where the organization stands in terms of ITIL, and provide tools and tech-
niques to help with the ITIL journey and ITIL goals.
The first book in the ITIL V2 library is Planning to Implement Service Management. 
The first book in the ITIL V3 library is Services Strategy. The International 
Standard for Service Management’s ISO/IEC 20000 says, “Service management 
shall be planned.” The first best practice for service management is clear: 
Start with strategy and a plan for how you’ll produce business value through 
service management improvements.
How ITIL Integrates with Other 
Best-Practices Frameworks
Sometimes in service management, “Is it ITIL?” discussions get more atten-
tion than business objective discussions. Deploying a best-practices frame-
work should be about business objectives, leveraging ITIL, and anything else 
that’s appropriate to help you achieve your goals, such as some of the other 
standards we mention in Chapter 4.

56
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
Any organization can use ITIL, but no organization should use it without 
considering other bodies of knowledge. ITIL says that taking an integrated 
approach to leveraging many sets of best practices and standards is itself a 
best practice.
ITIL documents are accepted best practices for executing service manage-
ment. Some people call them a “code of practice” for people who perform 
service management activities.
Following are some other common best practices for service management that 
integrate well with ITIL (for more information on all of them, see Chapter 4):
 
✓ COBIT: Provides excellent guidance for a system of management con-
trol. Organizations that adopt service management frequently adopt 
COBIT controls as well.
 
✓ eTOM: Provides accepted best practices for telecommunications service 
providers. eTOM gives service providers descriptions of common busi-
ness processes, which they can use to manage commercial business ser-
vices. eTOM users also leverage ITIL. ITIL and eTOM users have many 
common interests.
 
✓ ISO/IEC 38500: Provides valuable guidance for directing and control-
ling IT services. This standard, created by the ISO and the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), guides directors in approaching the 
very real and very high business risks and costs associated with IT ser-
vices. It provides guidance for directing, evaluating, and monitoring the 
governance of IT services.
 
✓ ISO/IEC 20000: Provides guidance for the auditable service management 
practices. Ideally, you use this standard in conjunction with ISO 9001 to 
provide a standards-based audit of a service provider’s service manage-
ment system.
It’s pretty obvious how important service management and a framework like 
ITIL are to our example ATM machine. A best-practices approach to service 
management will help ABC Financial decide what services it wants to provide 
through the ATM in the first place; how to design, build, and implement those 
services effectively; and how to make sure that it continues to provide its 
customers value.
An ATM machine isn’t just a piece of technology; it’s also a system of ser-
vices that includes people, processes, technology, and information. The ITIL 
framework provides guidelines to help IT build, operate, and improve the 
ATM machine so that it meets — and ideally exceeds — expectations.

I
f you’ve read the preceding five chapters of this book, you should have a 
good idea of what service management is and the role it can play in help-
ing your organization respond to customers and manage change.
In this chapter, we delve into what it means to implement service manage-
ment. We give you some examples of working across all aspects of business 
operations in an integrated way and show how you can use this approach to 
improve and extend the value of your company’s brand.
Seeing What Service Management 
Can Do for Your Organization
A service, in many instances, is a way of delivering value to a customer by 
facilitating the customer’s expected outcome. Effective service management 
is a way to ensure that outcome. It’s also a way to prepare your company for 
disruptive change.

58
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
You’re probably asking, “What does that mean — preparing your company 
for disruptive change?” Well, this isn’t your father’s (or mother’s) service 
delivery world. In the old days, the service provider might count on minimal 
change in the services that it delivered. In today’s markets, for most busi-
nesses, such market stability is absent. Consequently, service providers 
have to think differently. They have to think about how to leverage their 
assets and, perhaps, augment or integrate them to adapt for volatile market 
conditions and rising customer expectations. Service has become an area in 
which companies leapfrog competitors when they take new and innovative 
approaches to producing value from their existing assets. By enabling this 
services approach, they can help their customers get more value from their 
own assets. Service management is strategic.
Considering a real-world example
Remember when video stores dominated the way customers watched 
movies? When you wanted to watch a movie, you went to a video-rental 
retail outlet; browsed the selection of movies on the shelves; and, if you were 
lucky, got to take home an enticing movie. This process was the normal pro-
cess of video distribution for years. Companies that survived in that competi-
tive market did the right things. These companies were pretty smart. They 
realized that they needed to have the right number of copies of the most 
popular releases. Some of them also offered guarantees: If a movie wasn’t in 
stock, the customer could pick something else free of charge. They broad-
ened their product range by renting related products such as videogames 
and even the game systems; they also sold candy, popcorn, soda, and other 
merchandise. In other words, they worked hard to improve the customer 
experience and to exceed customer expectations.
Then something unexpected happened. A company called Netflix introduced 
an alternative way of distributing movies, based on an innovative use of 
emerging IT that allowed the company to measure and optimize the customer 
experience. Rather than visiting a video store, Netflix customers can order 
their movies online for shipment within a few days. The company makes it 
simple to order, receive, and return movies. Netflix also provides a simple 
way to queue up for the most popular movies when they’re first released. 
Needless to say, this company had a dramatic impact on customer expecta-
tions, although most competitors originally paid little attention and focused 
on business as usual.
Netflix didn’t rest on its success; it built on it. In addition to sending physical 
discs through the mail, it decided to further leverage the Internet by giving 
customers the ability to watch movies on their computers or gaming systems 

59
 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
in real time. Now customers don’t have to wait for the mail or wait in line for 
the movies or TV shows they want to watch; those products are available on 
demand in the home.
Relating the example to 
service management
How does this example relate to implementing service management? It shows 
that by monitoring and optimizing the services you provide your custom-
ers and stakeholders, you’re in a position to make changes in your business 
model that set you ahead of the competition. By implementing service man-
agement techniques, you have more time and resources to devote to keeping 
up with market and technology changes. Also, if you’ve built a system that is 
flexible enough to allow for change, you should be able to respond to those 
market and technology changes by offering more innovative services.
The important thing to understand in this example is that the service that is 
ultimately delivered is the same in all distribution methods: The customer 
gets to enjoy watching a movie. The movie provider that was most success-
ful, however, provided the service in the way that customers preferred.
When Netflix entered the market, it took an established idea and innovated 
on the delivery of the service. It replaced the traditional retail store with an 
online approach — an IT-enabled service. In many ways, the business service 
of getting movies into customers’ hands requires similar business systems in 
the back office, whether the distribution is through traditional retail stores 
or online. Both types of organizations need systems to record customers’ 
requests, both for billing and stocking purposes. They need an inventory 
system and quality control, along with the traditional set of back-office 
systems such as finance and human resources. When Internet technology 
evolved to the point at which streaming video to the household was possible, 
Netflix was able to change its business model again to take advantage of 
changing dynamics and technology evolution. Because of its ability to change 
dynamically, the company established strategic control of its service 
delivery.
Starting with the Service Strategy
To prevent confusion, we need to distinguish between a service strategy and 
a service management plan. For right now, we’ll just say that a service strategy 

60
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
is your road map for the future, based on your business goals. After you 
figure out your strategy, you need a service management plan to execute that 
strategy on a tactical basis (see the following section). The two concepts may 
sound like they’re the same thing, but they’re just close friends.
Creating a service strategy
When a company offers a distinctly new and different service or product, it 
can’t know for sure whether its customers — or potential customers — will 
want it. If you start with a known desired outcome and work backward to 
determine how to achieve that outcome by better leveraging all existing 
assets, however, you have more assurance of success in the new service 
offering.
To continue the Netflix example, when the company decided to offer its cus-
tomers a new service — streaming video — it went beyond trying to satisfy 
known customer demand for certain movies in certain formats and in certain 
capacities. The company moved to a plan to provide the desired outcome in 
a way that better leveraged all existing capabilities and resources. Many cus-
tomers now have Internet connections with networked devices plugged into 
their TV sets at home, for example. Because the desired outcome is to enjoy 
a movie at home, the provider considers what assets it has and what assets 
the customer has, and then determines how to integrate everything in a new 
configuration to provide a new service.
Finding out what customers really want
Companies aren’t always shooting in the dark. They leverage market research 
involving surveys and focus groups, and they have a pretty good idea of what 
customers think they want. Even so, it is entirely possible for any new prod-
uct or service to be rejected — even by customers who, when asked, were 
convinced that they wanted or needed it.
 
Be aware of the difference between what customers ask for and what they 
really want. Consider Henry Ford’s experience in creating his horseless car-
riage. Ford’s customers may have asked for horses that ran faster, ate less, 
and required less training and maintenance, but focusing on a desired out-
come instead gave him more assurance of success. Customers really wanted 
to travel to certain destinations that were connected by roads or paths; they 
wanted to steer; they didn’t want to walk; and they liked bringing other people 

61
 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
and things with them. A good horse-and-cart combination was one route to 
the desired outcome, but a technology-enabled alternative was another.
Getting a plan wrong is expensive, and getting it right begins with a service 
strategy: a provider’s plan for the services it will offer to customers and for 
delivering, marketing, and selling those services. One part of the Netflix 
service strategy, for example, is providing streaming video service to its 
customers.
Creating a Service Management Plan
In contrast to a service strategy, a service management plan defines how the 
provider will manage the services in the service strategy and road map. This 
plan is more complicated than it may sound. In the real world, companies 
typically work in silos (isolated implementations of services). IT operations 
in one division may have a separate service management implementation for 
a group of servers. Although silos and organization charts are convenient for 
internal order and control, they don’t serve customers — and very often gen-
erate internal friction in the company that prevents customers from getting 
their desired outcomes.
Business management staffers use the data available to them to think great 
thoughts about the business and to formulate products and service strate-
gies. They operate business units to provide — profitably and efficiently — 
products and services that will keep customer and stakeholder expecta-
tions satisfied. They plan for the future because they know that they’ll need 
to innovate with new products and services. They also understand that 
they need to provide better management of the products and services they 
already offer. Their plans include how to get more value from all their capa-
bilities and existing resources.
On another floor somewhere, IT management has its hands full operating 
the physical and virtual world of servers, applications, security, and the like. 
The typical IT organization sees itself as a systems support operation. (The 
same problem may occur in other aspects of enterprise operations.) But is 
this approach good enough? You probably anticipate at this point that the 
answer is no. Correct.
In the brave new world that has emerged, it isn’t wise for business and 
the various flavors of enterprise and IT operations to operate as separate 
silos. They need to align better. Better alignment of all operations with the 

62
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
business always has a twofold meaning: Operations can help drive the cost 
out of business products and services, and it can help differentiate the busi-
ness from its competitors. Technology-enabled services, for example, can 
reduce cost, improve quality, and help achieve specific business objectives. 
Technology improves a production line’s efficiency and reduces costs at the 
same time that it helps the research-and-development department innovate. 
In fact, business and operations need to expand the scope of alignment to 
levels we’ve never seen before. Just look at the Netflix example. Is its busi-
ness about enabling people to watch movies, or is it about service manage-
ment? Is service management the supporting actor, or does it play a lead 
role? A business needs to provide new, innovative IT-enabled services, and 
at the same time, it needs to manage the cost and quality of those services so 
that the price and reliability provide a desirable outcome.
In many businesses nowadays, service management needs to have a leading 
role. Where would Netflix be as a company if it didn’t monitor, measure, and 
optimize the way it offered its service to customers? Where would it be if it 
couldn’t support its innovations? Probably out of business.
Defining a Service Management Plan
In the general sense, all service management plans should point in the same 
direction. The goal is for all facets of operations that play a contributing role 
in business services — IT, facilities, plant operations, network operations, 
and beyond — to align with the business more effectively.
You may think, “I’ve heard that cliché a million and one times. IT has been 
trying to align itself more effectively with the business since Adam got his 
first computer.” So we’d probably better explain.
Figure 6-1 illustrates exactly what we mean. You start with managing the 
physical systems — be they systems of enterprise assets, smart assets, or 
IT assets. Then you focus on managing how all these systems relate to one 
another. Finally, you manage how these interconnected resources actually 
perform the series of processes required to satisfy the business goals.
In most organizations, the focus is on the management of systems — systems 
that individually don’t serve customers. The services that customers value 
typically are complex configurations of capabilities and resources that span 
business and operational lines, all of which must work together to provide a 
desirable outcome before the customer sees sufficient value.

To fully align with the business, all flavors of operations must evolve to the 
point where all their respective activities focus on business performance 
management. The final goal is managing business performance effectively. 
Companies take different approaches to managing performance, depending 
on industry dynamics and potential innovation. To reach that goal, opera-
tions as a whole first has to evolve to the point where its activities can be 
accurately described as service management — where operations no longer 
focuses only on managing systems, but also focuses on managing the ser-
vices that contribute to business performance.
That concept sounds simple — a two-step program from here to there. If that 
program were all that was involved, we could finish the book here. But ser-
vice management is a little more complicated, as we describe in the rest of 
the chapter.
Understanding Service Management 
and Governance
The scope of service management is broad and deep. Therefore, you need to 
have oversight of all the management processes and services, including how 

64
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
they work and what they actually do. You have to implement governance in 
the context of service management.
No matter how you organize a business, you end up with groups of people 
who have to collaborate and tools that have to integrate to serve the cus-
tomer. Because these groups need to work together to serve customers, you 
need some mechanism beyond the internal controls within each group to 
provide the overall direction and control to ensure that the services meet 
customer and stakeholder requirements. You need to establish clear deci-
sion rights and accountability chains (who is allowed to make what decisions 
under what circumstances) for each management process and each service. 
Good service management requires clarity and transparency in the decision 
rights and accountability chains for directing, controlling, and executing each 
management process and service. Without this clarity and transparency, 
human behavior and decision-making within the service provider don’t lead 
to outcomes that customers and stakeholders desire. The greatest risk that 
every service provider faces is human behavior and decisions that are out of 
alignment with stakeholder requirements.
We could continue to discuss the matter in this vein, but we can be a little 
simpler and refer to the models that we’ve already described. Service man-
agement is the set of management processes required to manage services. 
To explain what we mean, first we’ll remind you what a service is and how it 
relates to service management.
Suppose that an organization creates a service that calculates the tax rate 
for an order. We’ll call it the tax rate service. Service management is really 
the business manager, the controller, and the auditor combined. A piece 
of software ensures that the service calculates the order total according to 
company and government rules and then executes in an efficient manner. 
Although it would be nice to think that the company could use this auto-
mated program without any oversight or intervention, that scenario isn’t 
possible. Service management, therefore, must involve people, standardized 
processes, and tools to manage the service across traditional operational 
boundaries to support a comprehensive business service and all its moving 
parts. Indeed, in discussing the Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library (ITIL) in Chapter 5, we outline a set of standardized IT-centric man-
agement processes that support one major operational constituent with a 
vested interest in business-aligned service management. On the road to suc-
cess, however, all constituents — not just IT — must have a vested interest in 
the success of the business, and must govern and measure across operations 
to ensure the integrated management of business services.
Service management, like any other management discipline, requires mea-
surement. The old axioms “What gets measured gets done,” “Inspect what 

65
 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
you expect,” and “You can’t manage what you don’t know” still hold true. For 
every management process and every service, the provider needs manage-
ment information. Key performance indicators (KPIs) track the agreed-to 
activities. Key goal indicators measure the progress made toward business 
objectives. Key cost and quality indicators also have to be measured; oth-
erwise, the service provider is flying blind. Without some automation, man-
agers would be up very late at night trying to figure out how everything is 
working!
Automating Service
 
Effective automation is critical for managing service cost and quality, as well 
as for providing the information that you need for effective direction, control, 
and execution of services and service management. In most organizations, ser-
vice management automation is poor; consequently, the management informa-
tion just isn’t available.
Figure 6-2 illustrates the service automation path that an operational depart-
ment needs to traverse. It begins with automation, consisting of a set of frag-
mented services. Many IT departments find themselves in this situation. The 
next step from there is standardizing the foundations of service automation 
so that all service automation systems can talk to one another in a compre-
hensible way. That standardization establishes a basis for the integration of 
all services that contribute to the next step: overall service automation. The 
final step is optimizing across all those services.
 
Figure 6-2:

tion of

automation.

That process seems to be simple: Assuming that you start with fragmented 
services, you simply follow a nice three-step process. If you’re dealing with 
a tax collection service, you might make sure that it works effectively and 
does the right thing. So far, so simple. Don’t forget, however, that this pro-
cess becomes part of a service management plan, which complicates the 
matter.

66
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
Luckily, this situation translates into a pretty picture. Figure 6-3 illustrates 
the simple fact that the service management plan and service automation 
need to work together. The graph shows 12 areas of automation mapped 
against overall strategy. An organization can sit in any of those 12 areas. It 
may have highly developed service automation to the point of delivering 
an optimized service, yet any one operational team (such as facilities, plant 
operations, or network operations) may have limited vision in terms of its 
role in service management. The IT department may do nothing more than 
systems management, for example. Similarly, the company could have frag-
mented service automation but be fully focused on business performance 
management.

Service Management Automation
The usefulness of Figure 6-3 is that it helps with service management plan-
ning. It helps you define what management capability your organization 
needs to work on next.
 
When we refer to service automation, we’re referring directly to software. By 
contrast, service management also includes skilled staff members and stan-
dardized management processes. Both services and service management 
benefit from automation. Automation reduces human effort and labor costs. 
Reducing human effort also reduces human error that can hamper quality. 
Automation helps reduce cost and improve quality of service.

67
 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
A service strategy needs to include a service management plan. The service 
strategy sets the business context for the service management plan, includ-
ing the three interwoven strands: people, standardized processes, and tools 
that deliver automation.
Planning Service Strategy 
and Service Management
When you’re planning for implementation, here are five sets of questions that 
you should be able to answer about your road map:
 
✓ With the changes happening in my industry, how agile is my approach 
to managing my physical and virtual assets? Can my company change 
quickly enough while protecting the integrity of oversight, if it needs to?
 
✓ Can I manage my world if and when change comes? Does the organiza-
tion see sufficient collaboration across groups and divisions? How is this 
collaboration exhibited in terms of people, processes, and automation?
 
✓ Can I direct and control changes in my services if the inputs and out-
comes are different? Do I have the right level of visibility and control?
 
✓ Do I understand my management processes today? Can I adapt those 
processes to new business demands? Can I integrate those processes 
across the organization so that I get a complete view across my value 
chain? (A value chain is the sequence of business activities that links all 
important contributors to the company’s success, such as suppliers and 
customers.)
 
✓ Do I have a standards-based approach to service management to enable 
greater collaboration, not only across my own management domains, 
but also with my suppliers and customers? Do I have sufficient clarity 
and transparency in decision rights and accountability chains that I can 
change and innovate? Can I direct and control service management?
Finding Out How Your Organization 
Measures Up
The vision of service management laid out in the service strategy can be 
daunting for many organizations. You have to worry not only about keeping 

68
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
the lights on and the processes operating efficiently, but also about keeping 
customers happy and preventing competitors from gaining an advantage. 
How ready are you to change, innovate, grow, and compete? This question 
isn’t easy to answer, because it requires a certain level of assessment to 
determine the readiness of your organization. We lay out the framework for 
this assessment in Figure 6-3, earlier in this chapter, but the framework also 
includes the assessment of skills and standardized processes. As part of this 
assessment, you should ask the following sets of questions:
 
✓ Where is the business value within my organization? Which assets (sets 
of capabilities and resources) produce my company’s unique differen-
tiation: my information, for example, or my distribution network? Can I 
measure these assets in terms of how they’re designed to service cus-
tomer needs?
 
✓ Do I have a service management capability that enables my organization 
to change services quickly when the market demands innovation?
 
✓ How well does my service management capability prepare me to control 
costs and quality while providing customers what they need? Do I have 
the technology in place to measure the customer’s view of the value I’m 
offering and provide the detailed management information I need?
 
✓ Do I understand both my service and service management gaps — areas 
where I lack the systems that can address problems but can’t provide 
that capability? When I know where the business needs to be, can I 
direct and control the capabilities and resources required to get there?
This type of assessment is critical to your organization’s ability to move for-
ward. No organization should move to the adoption phase without a good, 
honest assessment of the current state of service management. The quickest 
route to ruin is acting without forethought.
Seeing What Service Management Will 
Look Like in Your Organization
Service management isn’t a project or a product. You might say, “I really just 
want to go out and buy something and be done with it. I’m ready to manage 
change and become an agile company.” If only life were that simple! Service 
management is a journey.
As we’ve discussed so far in this chapter, service management is a combina-
tion of vision, scope, and assessment. When you figure out where you are, 
you can begin to plan for where you want to be.

69
 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
Putting the focus on business performance
Unlike systems management, service management is about looking at busi-
ness performance rather than just server or data center management. In a 
typical systems management scenario, you may look at an incident. You log 
the incident, work to figure out what caused that problem, and come up with 
either a work-around or a patch to repair the problem. You’re done!
If you look at this same issue from a service management perspective, how-
ever, you’re looking at the incident differently. You have to ask what the 
incident was all about: what type of incident it was, whether it was isolated 
to a particular piece of hardware, whether a critical service wasn’t working 
properly, or whether the incident involved a network router or a potential 
disruption of a service.
Organizations need to think differently about how they deal with service 
disruptions. They need a combination of good tooling, skills, and informa-
tion to manage services in context with the business problems that they’re 
addressing.
To continue the Netflix example, suppose that the company is unable to 
stream a popular movie to its customers’ computers or game boxes. The 
company needs to ask itself a variety of questions, such as what impact the 
incident will have on customer expectations; which services were affected 
(or potentially affected); and whether the organization has the process, skills, 
and tools required to manage this situation and others like it.
When planning a change, management needs to understand which services 
are potentially affected and what the business outcome will be, as well as 
whether the company has the service configuration information required to 
assess the effect of the change. All of a sudden, the challenge is very tangible 
and fundamental: How should these services be managed? In other words, 
the organization needs to look at manageability from many perspectives with 
the right business context. It needs well-constructed strategies for managing 
customer expectations in context with costs, competitive conditions, and 
operational effectiveness. All these issues require skills and good judgment.

To really understand service management, you also should understand ser-
vice oriented architecture (SOA). We strongly recommend that you take a 
look at another book, Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.). (Yes, our team wrote that book too.) Why are we 
complicating things by bringing up SOA? We’re not. We’re trying to clarify the 
situation. We define service oriented architecture as a software architecture 
for building applications that implement business processes or services by 
using a set of loosely coupled, black-box components orchestrated to deliver 
a well-defined level of service.
Admittedly, this definition doesn’t flow trippingly from the tongue, but from 
it springs a sustainable, reusable, extensible approach to business and tech-
nology that is already providing huge competitive advantages to organiza-
tions around the globe. Here are some of the principal characteristics of SOA 
that are important for service management:
 
✓ SOA is a black-box component architecture. SOA deliberately hides 
complexity wherever possible, and the idea of the black box is integral 
to SOA. The black box enables the reuse of existing business applica-
tions by adding a fairly simple adapter to them, no matter how they 
were built.
 
✓ SOA components are loosely coupled. One component passes data to 
another component and makes a request; the second component car-
ries out the request and, if necessary, passes data back to the first. The 
emphasis is on simplicity and autonomy. Each component offers a small 
range of simple services to other components.
 
 A set of loosely coupled components does the same work that tightly 
structured applications used to do, but you can combine and recombine 
the components in myriad ways to make the overall service infrastruc-
ture much more flexible.
 
✓ SOA components are orchestrated to link through business processes 
to deliver a well-defined level of service. SOA creates a simple arrange-
ment of components that collectively can deliver a very complex busi-
ness service. Simultaneously, SOA must provide acceptable service 
levels. To that end, the architecture embodies components that ensure 
a dependable service level. Service level is tied directly to the best prac-
tices of conducting business, commonly referred to as business process 
management.
Because so many of the business applications that you have to manage are 
now built in this loosely coupled, modular fashion, service management 
needs to walk hand in hand with SOA. SOA becomes part of the architectural 
approach required to make the pieces of business services, processes, and 
operations work in coordination.

 Chapter 6: Implementing a Service Management Strategy
Getting to the Desired End State
We’ve given you a lot to think about in this chapter. Your organization will 
have to take many steps in its journey toward a well-structured and well-
managed service-based organization. Before you consider the goal of having 
a good handle on your managed services environment, however, you have to 
come up with a plan. You have to understand what makes your business and 
industry operate today and how those factors may change.
Achieving your goal of having a well-orchestrated, well-governed organization 
requires you to start with a vision of your end state and work backward. You 
have to understand what business you’re in, how that business works today, 
and how it will change. You can start to understand your business as an eco-
system — more like biology than a series of steps. In biology, you work with 
sets of interconnected systems. Something that goes wrong in one system 
may affect the overall set. When you understand this philosophy, it’s a lot 
easier to move away from looking at management as a set of independent 
steps.
In the next chapter, we provide some ideas for implementing a service man-
agement plan. Where you start depends largely on what you already have in 
place and how well coordinated you are on both the technical and manage-
ment level. A service management plan has the potential to take your organi-
zation to a whole new level of sophistication. It requires some work in areas 
such as education, strategy, assessment, and design.

Management
In This Chapter
▶ Charting the service management journey
▶ Discovering the four key elements that are part of the journey
▶ Measuring, monitoring, and optimizing
W
e hope you understand that service management isn’t just an opera-
tional issue; it’s also a business issue. In Chapter 6, we discuss how 
a service management plan supports the actual service strategy. The types 
of services that your organization needs to manage are much more diverse 
than ever before. To get started with service management, you need to take a 
holistic approach. You need to understand that just about every asset under 
your control — be it physical or virtual — must be managed in a way that 
allows you to integrate all your capabilities and resources so that you can 
direct and control the costs, quality, and value of your services.
In Chapter 6, we also talk about some of the hard work involved in setting a 
new direction for service management, including education, strategy devel-
opment, assessment, and design.
In this chapter, we give you some ideas of how to put your service management 
plan into action. First, however, here are two key things that you shouldn’t do:
 
✓ Don’t think of service management as being just an IT operations 
problem. In other words, you shouldn’t begin by sending the IT staff to 
get best-practices certifications and assume that certification alone will 
help you deliver a successful service management plan. Before you send 
anyone for training, make sure that everyone in the organization under-
stands the business goals of service management, as well what service 
management is and why it’s imperative to the company’s long-term 

74
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
success. You need to start by recognizing that the strategy of the business 
needs to be continually reevaluated in harmony with the service strategy 
and the service management plan. Your service management strategy will 
involve a collaboration among the chief executive, operations, and infor-
mation officers because it involves strategy, business operations, and IT.
 
✓ Don’t try to do everything at the same time. You need a vision for the 
future and an incremental road map that describes how you’ll travel 
from where you are to where you want your services to be.
In this chapter, we offer some suggestions about how to optimize your busi-
ness through service management. We talk about some key components 
of service management, including education, strategy development, needs 
assessment, and strategy design. We also talk about another key component 
of a service management plan: the need to measure, monitor, and optimize 
your approach to achieve the business outcomes that your business needs.
Four Key Elements to Consider
 
The most important thing to keep in mind is that not every company is at the 
same place in its journey toward service management. Therefore, your com-
pany may have a different entry point from another company, based on how 
much your company has already done.
In the following sections, we discuss four key areas that you need to consider 
when you’re actually implementing service management.
Education: A crucial component
Education is crucial because one of the biggest limiters of service management 
is human understanding of service management. Educating the team is at the 
heart of getting started.
 
The best starting point for education is making sure that everyone understands 
the foundation of the business itself. Employees should understand the following 
aspects of the business and be able to answer the following questions:
 
✓ The company’s industry: Is your company in transportation, hospitality, 
or manufacturing, for example?
 
✓ Customer expectations: Do you understand how to provide value to 
your customers? What is the customer experience of working with your 
company like?

75
 Chapter 7: Launching into Service Management
 
✓ Logical components: What are all the pieces that are necessary to make 
your business work well?
 
✓ Most critical services: What business services and supporting IT services 
are most critical to your customers and stakeholders?
 
✓ Biggest contributor to the cost, quality, and value of the business 
services: What are the most expensive aspects of your business services? 
Are they important to overall quality and value for your customers and 
partners?
This process may not sound like rocket science, and it isn’t! Everyone in the 
company should have this knowledge, which takes on a new sense of urgency 
in the service management area because you’re on the front line in terms of 
ensuring that your company understands its goals, objectives, and customer 
expectations.
Certification classes in industry best practices and standards can help 
operations get ready for a service management approach. In addition to the 
classes, you can find armloads of the books associated with the certification 
programs. Couple these programs with a focus on your service strategy, which 
is driven by the business strategy. Classes in best practices taken in isolation 
won’t help you reach your business objectives. If these best practices are going 
to be meaningful, everyone in the business needs the same level of understand-
ing of what these best practices will be applied to.
Creating centers of excellence
In addition to formal courses, organizations can 
expand knowledge across business and tech-
nical leaders through centers of excellence. 
A center of excellence is a process of bring-
ing together key people from all areas of the 
business and operations to focus on best prac-
tices. A center of excellence provides a way 
for groups within the company to collaborate. 
This group also becomes a force for change, as 
it can leverage its growing knowledge to help 
different business units learn from experience.
Establishing a center of excellence is one way 
that your organization can improve a corporate 
culture that has become stagnant. You want 
to make sure that your corporate culture sup-
ports your ability to change. Also make sure 
that you view cultural issues as being core to 
the business and service strategy, and incor-
porate these issues into your educational plan. 
You can use a center of excellence to explore 
corporate-culture issues, as well as to set an 
agenda for change to ensure that people at all 
levels of the organization — from senior man-
agement to entry-level assistants, customer-
service representatives, and operations staff 
members — have a holistic view of the mission 
and goals of the organization.

76
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
Service strategy: The driver of 
the service management plan
One of the most important requirements for service management is putting 
a strategy in place, which involves understanding what your business looks 
like today and how it may change in the future. The first thing to do is estab-
lish objectives. You need to ask yourself, “What do I really want to achieve?” 
Remember that your service management plan is based on the service strategy 
and needs to support changing business conditions and customer expectations.
Remember our example bank, ABC Financial, from earlier chapters? Although 
the bank is well established in its ability to provide automated teller 
machines (ATMs) to its customers, it needs to plan for a future that may be 
different from the present and the past. It needs to understand the expecta-
tions of its customers and anticipate how those expectations may change.
ABC Financial has a fundamental business goal of accepting deposits and 
providing cash to customers through its system of ATMs. Various key per-
formance indicators (KPIs; see Chapter 5) are associated with this goal: Cash 
must be available for customers 24 hours a day; each ATM must be fully 
functioning 99 percent of the time; and at least one ATM must be functioning 
within a specific geographic radius. The operations team at ABC Financial initi-
ates a cost-cutting initiative, expecting to save $800,000 in annual maintenance 
fees on the company’s ATMs. This plan was put in place based on company 
goals for cost cutbacks. The operations and ATM-services divisions, however, 
didn’t collaborate on plans for this new project. Each division had real goals 
to achieve but didn’t evaluate the impact of the cost-cutting measures on 
customer expectations.
The new ATM maintenance plan didn’t actually save money for the bank; the 
downtime was so great that it destroyed previously strong customer rela-
tionships. Customers moved to competitors, and the resulting losses to the 
bank were far greater than the dollars saved from the cost-cutting measures. 
Lesson learned: The overall goals for the business need to be evaluated in con-
text with one another, and everyone in the company needs to understand what 
these goals are before any decisions about service management are made.
 
Companies that are prepared for the future have well-articulated corporate 
goals that are understood and followed throughout the enterprise. An under-
standing of corporate goals becomes part of the business fabric of the 
organization.

77
 Chapter 7: Launching into Service Management
 
Service management begins with the business. Good service management 
requires leadership so that employees understand their responsibilities within 
the context of the broader business goals and objectives of the enterprise. 
Inherent conflicts are likely to arise between divisions or departments that are 
trying to achieve specific KPIs. These conflicts need to be anticipated and 
planned for at the enterprise level to create a service management plan that 
produces consistent results.
Assessment: Where you are today 
and where you want to go
When your company’s service strategy is in place, it’s time to do an assessment. 
This assessment includes a step-by-step approach to understanding the busi-
ness you’re in and developing a vision for the future. You need to specify what 
services your business offers and what the company needs to achieve your 
vision. When you know what your objectives are, you can assess your current 
service management capability around those particular goals. At this time, you 
can find the gaps in your service management capability and develop a plan to 
deal with those gaps. It’s important to evaluate what you have if you expect to 
be able to locate and close the gaps and achieve your strategy.
An organization can’t thrive in a competitive market unless everyone on 
the technical and business sides knows the company’s objectives, which 
includes understanding the definitions of the business and the customer and 
knowing how the company plans to meet its objectives. A member of the IT 
staff who’s responsible for keeping company servers up and running, for 
example, must understand his responsibilities in the context of the IT-enabled 
business services that the individual servers are part of. Just understanding 
the technical requirements for managing the servers isn’t sufficient; the staff 
member also needs to have a realistic understanding of the business implica-
tions of downtime and the relative significance to the business of the 
different applications running on those servers.
Assessing where you are today is really about evaluating your technical and 
organizational readiness for implementing your service management plan. 
You may already have many of the technical components required for a well-
integrated infrastructure, but you may maintain them in a siloed manner (see 
Chapter 6). By evaluating your infrastructure from the perspective of an inte-
grated enterprise, you may find that you don’t need much in the way of 
additional technology. You may determine, however, that you do need a 
center of excellence (refer to the “Creating centers of excellence” sidebar, 
earlier in this chapter) that empowers business and IT to leverage the 
technology at hand to reach new levels of integration and success.

78
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
Here are some questions you may want to ask during the assessment process:
 
✓ Do you have a consistent way to manage assets across your organization?
 
✓ Do you have a process for change and configuration that ensures that all 
members of the organization have reliable access to the service configu-
ration information they need to perform their responsibilities?
 
✓ Can you ensure that business services created and maintained by one 
division are made available in a consistent manner across other areas of 
your organization?
 
✓ Will these business services help you reach your goals when they’re 
adapted to the various divisions of the company?
 
✓ Do you have a process for assessing whether your technical and business 
divisions are performing at the right levels to keep customers satisfied?
 
✓ Have you developed a process to identify business services and encourage 
sharing across the enterprise where appropriate?
 
✓ Can you monitor and measure the effect of your strategy on demands for 
security, storage, and hardware?
 
✓ Are organizational structures in place that support creative knowledge 
sharing across business and IT teams?
 
✓ Have you identified roadblocks — such as outdated or inflexible busi-
ness processes or people who place personal power ahead of delivering 
value to customers and business stakeholders — that may hamper your 
success in a collaborative business/IT world?
 
✓ Does your corporate culture support processes that help balance the 
management of individual components against the broader needs of 
managing customer experience?
Service management plan: A road 
map for moving forward
When you understand the gaps, you can start to design your service manage-
ment plan. Because you’ve done (or will do) an assessment, this design isn’t 
a matter of everyone just grabbing a hammer to build a house; the design 
needs to be well thought out. You need to understand and plan for service-
level commitments when you’re designing solutions and services. If you wait 
until services are delivered to figure out service levels and other management 
issues, you’ve waited too long. How will you make sure that you have the 
capacity, security, and financing available?

79
 Chapter 7: Launching into Service Management
We mention reusable components in Chapter 6, and you certainly should 
consider this concept to be part of the design process. The discovery of 
services shouldn’t be confined to one department or even confined to your 
company; you also need to look at your broader ecosystem of partners, sup-
pliers, and customers. You aren’t discovering just pieces of code, for example; 
you’re also discovering what business processes exist in your company and 
what resources they need to access or integrate with. Look for overlapping 
or contradictory business processes, and fix them before they cause serious 
business problems.
 
An essential ingredient of a successful approach to service management is a 
well-defined, rationalized, and integrated approach to infrastructure. It’s par-
ticularly important to ensure that you have a well-integrated architecture to 
support the intersecting physical, virtual, and IT worlds. This area is where 
service oriented architecture (SOA) may be very helpful. (See Chapter 6 for 
some basic definitions of SOA.) If your service strategy centers on the devel-
opment of a stand-alone data center, your infrastructure requirements may 
not require a SOA approach. Your top priority, however, should be to create 
a road map that lays out where you are today and defines your steps to the 
future. A road map helps by ensuring that you take a measured, step-by-step 
approach to developing and defining your infrastructure. You shouldn’t plan 
to do everything at the same time.
One reason why moving too quickly can be a problem is that you may be 
tempted to skip some of the details. Throughout the process, details matter. 
You must pay attention to details such as fine-tuning your configuration, 
looking at the dependencies among services, and considering how the pieces 
fit together in context with customer expectations and change.
Don’t Forget to Measure, 
Monitor, and Optimize
You’ve educated your team, assessed your readiness for service manage-
ment, and designed your service management plan. Do you sit back in a 
comfy chair and wait for the profits to roll in? No! Your business and opera-
tional strategies are never static. You always have more work to do because 
the business environment changes constantly. (Refer to the Netflix example 
in Chapter 6. That company was able to challenge traditional video stores by 
changing to a technology-driven business model.) Technological and busi-
ness change happens so quickly that you can never assume that your strat-
egy is complete.

80
Part II: Getting the Foundation in Place 
 
The processes you create to measure, monitor, and optimize your results are 
critical components of any service management plan. Thinking about the mea-
surements you need as you begin developing your service management plan is 
important. These measurements should be designed to help you meet your 
objectives. Your business doesn’t operate in a static environment; therefore, 
your capabilities for monitoring and measuring must always be active. You 
need to monitor and measure against your service objectives on an ongoing 
basis to ensure that you understand how your business is performing on a 
day-to-day basis and optimize your future outcomes.
To continue the ABC Financial example, suppose that one division of the 
company decided on several business objectives to help measure and moni-
tor results related to ATM services. Unfortunately, ABC Financial’s monitor-
ing process was based on a series of KPIs that were inconsistent across the 
company. The company didn’t have its eye on the ball during a crucial eco-
nomic period. Customers expected high (99.9 percent) availability at ATMs 
and wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less. ABC Financial let cost-cutting 
measures interfere with its ability to meet its KPI for ATM availability. The 
company suffered because it didn’t measure and monitor the right outcomes.
The monitoring-and-measuring process must be designed to make allowances 
for evaluating changes in quality relative to cost. As ABC Financial adjusts 
its service strategy, for example, it has many trade-offs to consider. In its 
desire to improve customer satisfaction, it may decide to include several 
high-quality new products that customers want but that are very expensive 
to maintain. As it turns out, the value of these products is high for only a 
small segment of the customer base, and the cost of producing and maintain-
ing these products is high. It’s unwise to optimize a subsystem (such as new 
ATM services) at the expense of a service management system. The result 
can be an unmanageable cost structure.

how it’s governed. We identify the technical foundations 
of service management, particularly the data that it uses 
and the primary service management processes that cre-
ate and maintain that data.

n earlier chapters, we mention that service management is a big field 
that covers information technology of every conceivable kind and also 
involves understanding how to organize staff to manage that technology, not 
just to make it run, but also to make it run effectively and (ideally) in highly 
optimized fashion. Service management also embraces the governance of IT, 
best practices, the alignment of IT with the business, the integration of all the 
technology, and the monitoring of both business key performance indicators 
(KPIs) and IT KPIs.
We confess right now that this book doesn’t give a detailed explanation of 
every service management process, underlying technology, and tactic that 
you can adopt to provide effective services. Luckily, that isn’t the goal of this 
book. What we intend to do is give you an all-round appreciation of what 
service management is and how to deliver it successfully in the context of a 
living, breathing organization.
In this chapter, we present service management in overview, making the 
link between service management at the business level and at the IT level. 
We provide a way of looking at the whole service management process 
and also tackle the question of the value of service management within an 
organization.

Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
Viewing Service Management 
in a Business Model
You may wonder why we haven’t yet defined precisely what falls under the 
heading of service management from a technology perspective, so we’ll do 
that immediately. Consider the simple diagram in Figure 8-1. This figure depicts 
the fact that from an external perspective, an organization can be viewed as 
a collection of business services performed directly or indirectly for the ben-
efit of customers. Within that model, from an IT perspective, many elements 
of the various business services involve IT business applications. Those busi-
ness applications operate effectively (if they do) because of the technologies, 
processes, and skills that collectively make up service management.

If you consider IT from an external perspective, you can think of service man-
agement as being mainly invisible. The IT applications provide automation 
to various parts of the business processes that run through the organization, 
and they need a variety of resources to deliver their benefits. Service man-
agement monitors those applications and sometimes also monitors the busi-
ness processes that they serve.
Perhaps to a businessperson, service management is mainly invisible, limited 
to the voice at the help desk and a relationship manager to negotiate service-
level expectations and costs.

85
 Chapter 8: The Service Management Universe
A simpler way to look at service management is to divide it into layers, as we 
do in the following section.
Understanding the Six Layers 
of Service Management
Service management is carried out with a variety of applications. Business 
applications consist of software and data; they run on computer hardware; 
and they have users. Given just those facts, you have four distinct layers to 
think about: software, data, hardware, and staff.
Now add the fact that all these business applications and the computers 
involved in running them need to be housed somewhere, either on desktop 
computers or in specially built data centers. That fact correlates to a founda-
tion layer.
Finally, you need to acknowledge that in one way or another, some service 
management activities may be delivered as services. Some help-desk activity 
could be outsourced to a call center, for example, or some of the facilities 
provided to run applications could be delivered by a service provider. This 
fact gives you a sixth layer. Figure 8-2 shows all six layers.

86
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
Defining the six layers
In the following sections, we describe these layers one by one.
Facilities and Data Center
Most companies have one or more data centers where all shared computer 
resources are kept. With the current state of technology, even medium-size 
organizations have a clear need for data centers, because computers require 
specialized electrical power, physical security, atmospheric control (usually, 
a dramatic amount of air conditioning), and communications. A data center 
may also perform specialized activities, such as printing, scanning, or cre-
ating DVDs. Data center space is very expensive because of its specialized 
nature, and a data center can’t be expanded easily and simply.
Organizations that are geographically distributed may have multiple data 
centers, of course, and there may even be multiple data centers just for the 
sake of disaster recovery. The distribution of client computers around an 
organization should be considered to be part of the Facilities and Data Center 
layer, which is all about the accommodation of computing and communica-
tions resources. Ultimately, that means that all areas accommodating net-
work access devices, such as automated teller machines or kiosks in shops, 
are part of this layer.
Computer Hardware
As in all other areas of IT, an organization has to make choices about the 
sizes of the computers it buys and about how those computers are managed 
as a collective resource. Sometimes an application has to be implemented 
on a specific item of hardware, but usually, some flexibility is available. The 
direction of technology is toward greater flexibility, with the idea of an appli-
cation being able to run on almost any hardware platform.
Naturally, organizations attempt to optimize their use of hardware in what-
ever ways possible, such as by establishing purchasing and replacement 
strategies. They’re likely to have different strategies for data center comput-
ers, desktop computers, and the full variety of mobile devices.
Information/Data
Application data presents several problems apart from how it needs to be 
used in applications or shared among applications (which isn’t the problem 
of service management). Primarily, data has to be located in a convenient 
place; secured against theft; and backed up so that it can be restored in the 

87
 Chapter 8: The Service Management Universe
event of hardware or software failure and, probably, just to meet auditing/
compliance requirements. This requirement naturally extends to desktop 
devices and mobile devices; hence, the fairly simple needs for availability, 
security, and recovery alone can become complex.
Application data isn’t the only kind of data. A whole set of data is created and 
used in service management activities, such as log files, asset data, and man-
agement data of all types.
Software/Applications
Software has the same characteristics as data in some ways because it’s 
stored as data, so everything we note about data also applies to software. In 
addition, software needs to be configured for use, and management of the 
configuration of thousands of software components in a large network is 
itself a complex activity.
Also, software — whether it’s application, operating-system, or management 
software — has a life cycle that also demands management.
Staff/Operatives
All service management activities include manual elements and demand a 
certain level of skill from staff members. Many of these activities are struc-
tured according to experience with the task, built up over years, or imple-
mented from best practices based on some authority. Collectively, the staff 
(including all its management elements) can be viewed as being the presiding 
intelligence of service management.
Business Services
All service management activities are internal business services of one sort 
or another whose function is to support other business services, including — 
most important — those services that are provided to customers. Some of 
these business services can be outsourced. Indeed, some organizations have 
taken the rather drastic step of outsourcing the whole of their operational IT 
activities. Thus, in those instances, almost all service management activities 
have been outsourced.
The point is that you can think of service management activities (busi-
ness services) as being assembled and constructed from the combination 
of the resources in the five layers below them (Staff/Operatives, Software/
Applications, Information/Data, Computer Hardware, and Facilities and Data 
Center).

88
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
Recognizing the dynamic 
nature of the six layers
We present this six-layer model to draw attention to a couple of facts: Each 
of these layers can be considered in isolation, and various policies or broad 
guidelines can be created for managing each layer. More important, however, 
is the fact that these layers are not at all static. Everything keeps changing, 
which makes managing the whole ensemble difficult.
In the following sections, we discuss the layers one by one again, but this 
time, we discuss them from the perspective of change.
Changes in the Facilities and Data Center layer
If you look back over the past 15 years, you see huge changes in the nature of 
the typical data center. It went from catering to tens of servers to hundreds 
of servers or (in some companies) thousands of servers. As the data center 
grew dramatically, the parameters for air conditioning and cooling changed, 
and so did the power requirements.
Now consider other computing devices. Laptops have replaced desktops for 
many people, and smartphones are replacing mobile phones to some degree. 
If those changes weren’t enough, we’re slowly moving to a world of embed-
ded processors and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags attached to 
anything that moves. Therefore, any facility or space is potentially a comput-
ing facility and connected to the corporate network in some way.
Changes in the Computer Hardware layer
Regular dramatic changes in the capabilities of computer hardware have 
been the rule rather than the exception for decades now. These changes 
have been driven by Moore’s law, which not only affects CPUs, but also con-
fers its gifts on memory, switches, disk speeds, and just about every other 
component of a computer. Consequently, no fixed approach to computer and 
network architectures is possible. The parameters keep changing, making 
hardware configurations that were once impractical quite viable. All disk files 
used to be local to the server running the application that used them, for 
example. Then came file servers, storage area networks (SANs), and network 
attached stores (NAS). Applications that used to run on a single sever are 
now spread across multiple servers.
Changes in the Information/Data layer
At one time, all data was structured data, held in files or databases. The 
advent of document management and text mining tools added less-structured 

89

data to the mix. Then came sound, images, and video. At the same time, the 
volume of data grew. Companies that once stored megabytes of data began 
to preside over gigabytes and then terabytes — and recently in some compa-
nies, data volumes have grown to the petabyte level.
Changes in the Software/Applications layer
Naturally, the growth in computer power has been accompanied by a growth 
in the number of useful applications that businesses can exploit. The advent 
of the Internet connected most of the computers in the world and subse-
quently delivered new ways of carrying out many business activities, from 
buying airline tickets to disposing of unwanted inventory. The Internet has 
continued to ramp up the speed of change in terms of new applications, and 
change will only get faster as smartphones displace less-sophisticated mobile 
phones.
This situation has unwelcome aspects, particularly in the area of IT security, 
where investment in software is necessary for self-protection. To add to 
the complexity, all software — whether it’s infrastructure or application 
software — goes through regular revisions and enhancements, so nearly all 
the software that an organization runs changes over time. These changes 
make managing the Software/Applications layer very difficult, because incom-
patibilities and errors need to be prevented at all costs.
Changes in the Staff/Operatives layer
As the technology continually changes in every layer, the skills required for 
understanding how systems function also change. This situation can cut 
both ways. The complexity of operating and managing technology some-
times increases and sometimes diminishes. As a result, the people who are 
in charge of managing a complex network of computers need to be retrained 
regularly, and they need to be familiar with technology developments in the 
industry.
Changes in the Business Services layer
The service levels that customers or IT users expect from business services 
evolve all the time. A company in a particularly competitive market may 
decide to improve its level of service dramatically so that no competitor 
can match its performance, for example. In general, however, as technology 
sophistication improves, customer expectations of service grow, and as cus-
tomer expectations expand, IT has no choice but to meet rising expectations.
This situation is precisely what happened when e-mail became an increasingly 
important corporate service. At one time, e-mail users — including employ-
ees, customers, and partners — may have been satisfied with 99 percent 

90
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
availability. That level of availability, however, meant that the e-mail service 
would be unavailable 3.65 days a year, which would translate into 15 minutes 
of downtime every day. We don’t know many companies that would put up 
with that performance level now that e-mail has become part of the business 
fabric. Such changes in service demand are difficult to predict and can’t be 
met without investments of one sort or another.
Determining the Value of 
Service Management
How do you decide on the value of service management? This question is 
such a good one that we’re not sure why we haven’t mentioned it before. 
Unfortunately, it’s not an easy one to answer. We’re going to take a stab at 
answering it, though, because chapter after chapter of this book discusses 
the benefits of service management. Service management isn’t free . . . or 
cheap. So unless you have an infinite budget — and we suspect that you 
don’t — examining the value of service management is important.
So far in this chapter, we’ve discussed service management in terms of 
layers. Keeping these layers in mind, we turn now to looking at service man-
agement in terms of costs. We consider costs in the following areas:
 
✓ Support
 
✓ Optimization
 
✓ Risk
 
✓ Change
These different strands of service management deliver benefits in distinctly 
different areas, and we discuss them separately in the following sections.
Support costs
Just for fun, we’ll start by getting all mathematical and proposing an equa-
tion, which we’ll call Equation A:
App cost = Cost of app resource + cost of SM resource
This equation shouldn’t scare you, because it’s very simple. Just think of any 
business application; its cost consists of all the resources it uses directly 

91
 Chapter 8: The Service Management Universe
plus all the management support it requires (service management, repre-
sented in the equation as SM). Look at it this way: You could buy the applica-
tion and all the resources it needs to run, including operators (if any), and 
then you could just run it.
If you did that without considering the service management component, 
however, the service that the application provided would degrade quickly. 
Various hardware, software, and even user errors would occur over time, and 
someone would need to handle those errors to keep the application healthy. 
Support costs are inevitable for all applications, and service management 
processes deliver the support.
Support cost is what an organization pays to deliver the acceptable service 
level for a particular application over a targeted life span, and that service 
level is determined by the organization’s demands. If you look at service 
management this way, you also need to distinguish between the operational 
personnel who run the applications and the support personnel who manage 
the service.
Optimization costs
Here, we introduce another equation, Equation B:
Total facility costs = Σ Cost of app resource + Σ cost of SM resource – Σ 
SM savings
This equation also is quite simple. It suggests that the costs of the whole IT 
facility are equivalent to the sum of the costs of all applications and the costs 
of SM activities minus (excluding) the amount of savings that the SM activi-
ties achieve.
For each of the six layers we describe in this chapter (refer to “Understand-
ing the Six Layers of Service Management,” earlier in this chapter), you can 
achieve economies of scale simply by managing the entire layer as a single 
entity. You can manage the Facilities and Data Center layer as a single entity, 
the Computer Hardware layer as a single entity, the Information/Data layer as 
a single entity, and so on. This practice has many aspects. Negotiating intel-
ligent contracts with hardware and software vendors can reduce unit costs; 
virtualization strategies may reduce the square footage required in the data 
center; and common data backup procedures may reduce the cost of backup 
and recovery. All such activities fall into one layer or another.

92
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
Equation B, therefore, states that you can use service management technol-
ogy and processes to optimize many aspects of the IT operation, and when 
you do so successfully, you bring down the costs.
Risk costs
Suppose that your organization has a service level of 99.95 percent availabil-
ity. What does a service level of 99.95 percent availability actually mean? No 
doubt it means that the IT department will do what it can to ensure that an 
application is available almost all the time, to the extent that it is unavailable 
for four hours or so every year.
That availability level is only a target, however. In reality, ensuring such a 
high level of availability is very difficult, and you have no hard-and-fast way 
to ensure meeting such a target. All you can do is ensure the probability of 
meeting the target.
Think in terms only of simple failures, and you realize that this statement 
must be true. An application may fail because of hardware or network fail-
ure, and although you can put a great deal of redundancy into the computer 
architecture to make failure unlikely, making failure impossible would be 
very expensive. To complicate this example beyond simple failure, consider 
the possibility of operating-system errors, errors in other fundamental soft-
ware, or bugs in the application itself. You can also include mistakes made by 
staff members, and just for good measure, you can add unavailability due to 
security breaches, which have been known to bring down whole networks.
When you look at this situation this way, you realize that you have no simple 
way to ensure any specific level of availability. All you can do is manage the 
risk that the system will become unavailable.
When an application does become unavailable, a definite cost is involved, 
and this cost can have three elements:
 
✓ Lost business: This cost is the direct cost of sales that never happened 
because of the system’s unavailability.
 
✓ Brand damage: This cost is the drop in customer confidence caused by 
the service failure.
 
✓ Repairs: This cost can be small or perhaps even nonexistent, but in the 
case of a security breach, it can be very high indeed.
This situation presents quite a conundrum, because you can always sink 
more money into various areas of IT to deliver better service levels. Also, to 

93
 Chapter 8: The Service Management Universe
a certain degree, service levels are points of competition. Underinvestment 
in high service levels may lead to loss of business, whereas overinvestment 
surely leads to unnecessarily high costs. We can produce a mathematical for-
mula, Equation C, to express the situation:
SM cost = Probability × (Cost of lost business + cost brand damage + cost 
of repair)
The point is that it’s unwise to invest any more in service management than 
is necessary to improve service levels or justified by the cost of failures. In 
other words, you shouldn’t invest any more than customer expectations 
require.
The obvious exception occurs when a company deliberately raises its ser-
vice level as a competitive move. In this situation, the expense is related to a 
business decision — not a technical decision — and in the end, that business 
decision may be the secret to a great service management strategy.
Change costs
Finally, we come to investment in service management that is implemented 
specifically to manage change. The problem with the factor of change in IT is 
that change comes in two flavors:
 
✓ Predictable
 
✓ Disruptive
Under the heading of predictable change come all the factors that can be 
measured and tracked: the cost of computer hardware, the cost of software, 
the growth of data, the number of users, the number of customers accessing 
systems, the variety of transactions being supported, and so on. The growth 
of these factors can be predicted with reasonable accuracy over time. Then 
this growth can be combined with corporate plans for new products and 
services to determine future investments in service management and new 
IT applications.
The more difficult problem is disruptive change. By definition, disruptive 
change is unpredictable, and it can demand unexpectedly high levels of 
investment simply because a business has no easy way to prepare for it. 
Legislative change, such as that imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
in the United States, can be disruptive. Exploding security problems are an 
example of disruptive change in the technology world. Sudden economic 
changes, from currency swings to stock-market crashes, also can be highly 

94
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
disruptive. The best preparation for dealing with disruptive change is having 
a service management system that is coherent and flexible.
If you’ve been following this discussion closely, you probably wonder 
what we mean by a service management system. That’s the topic of the next 
chapter.

P
eople don’t find computers to be as mysterious as they once did. You 
can blame the PC for that fact. As PCs became ubiquitous, just about 
everyone came to understand roughly how a computer works. Very few 
people knew exactly how a computer works down at chip level, but most 
people know that a computer itself has electronic circuits (hardware) that 
execute instructions (software) and store the results (data).
Before that time, it was credible to write science-fiction stories about a com-
puter that had exceeded the intelligence of man and was about to take over 
the world, exterminating those pesky humans in the process and then play-
ing 3D chess with itself for eternity. After the PC proliferation, the story lines 
became a little different. The superintelligent computer still tried to take over 
the world, but just as it was about to send the robot armies out to extermi-
nate us, it suffered a blue-screen event and died.
This scenario is where service management comes in. If IT professionals get 
things right, they reduce the possibility that this computer will suffer a blue 
screen, and if it does, they ensure that another one is ready to step up and 
take its place. But don’t blame the members of the service management staff 
if it happens. They don’t program the computers; they just try to ensure that 
the computers deliver an acceptable level of service.

Understanding the Relationships 
in Systems
Although we have mentioned computer systems many times already in this 
book, we haven’t yet defined the components of a computer system and the 
relationships among those components. This section is a good place to do 
that, because now you’re ready to explore the foundations of service man-
agement technology, which means that you need to have a practical view of 
what computers and networks are.
Computers and computer networks
In Figure 9-1, we represent a computer system in a simple way that even a 
casual user can understand. The system consists of hardware, software, data, 
and users.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The com-
ponents of 
a computer 
system.
 
User(s)
Hardware
Data
Software
All the elements of the system relate to one another, as indicated by the 
arrows:
 
✓ The user interacts with hardware (keyboard, mouse, and screen).
 
✓ The user interacts with software by running applications.

97
 Chapter 9: The Technical Foundation of Service Management
 
✓ The user employs applications to create data.
 
✓ The software (applications) creates, changes, and deletes data.
 
✓ The software runs on hardware.
 
✓ The data is stored on hardware.
These components are not as simple as they look in this figure, however. The 
computer hardware has many components; the data files on a computer are 
many and often complex; and the software is unlikely to be just one applica-
tion but many applications (including the operating system) that carry out a 
wide variety of tasks.
Figure 9-1 depicts a single computer. What about a whole network of comput-
ers? Well, this figure works for that purpose too, because computer networks 
consist entirely of users, software, hardware, and data. The importance of 
this diagram is that it shows, in a very simple way, everything that a com-
puter network consists of and all the relationships involved.
Service management systems
Now we’ll step back for a moment and consider the nature of service manage-
ment. Service management is about supporting and ensuring the business 
services that an organization provides; it involves supporting and ensuring 
all the business applications that an organization runs. You can’t do that 
unless you know where all the applications are, who is using them, which 
machines they run on, and what data they create and use.
As far as computer systems and computer networks are concerned, the fun-
damental service management system is the one that captures, organizes, 
and stores all the data that allows all other service management processes to 
run. It’s the system that captures and organizes all the data about users, soft-
ware, data files, and hardware.
As you read this book, you see that service management involves a large 
number of distinct processes. Here’s a short list: application management, 
system management, performance management, service desk, network 
management, database management, desktop management, mobile device 
management, IT security, voice and communications management, and 
provisioning.
Most of those processes have software capability that implements them, and 
each element of software needs to store information that relates to users, 
software, data, and hardware. Where is that information going to be stored?

98
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
If you answer this question by saying, “In the configuration management 
database,” we’d have to respond, “Well, actually, no, but you’re kinda half 
right.”
To explain this answer, we have to explain what we mean by a configuration 
management database.
Working with a Configuration 
Management Database
Various service management processes need to store data about the IT 
environment, including people, software, data, and hardware, as well as the 
relationships among them. The configuration management database (CMDB) 
is the database that holds this information.
Imagine that you have 30 software applications, and each one stores its own 
data in the format that it needs that data to be in. This example seems to be 
rather straight forward until you realize from experience that these 30 appli-
cations are going to have real problems coordinating with one another. It 
would be much better if all 30 applications used the same data standards and 
shared a database that was the single source of the truth.
That idea is a nice one, but it belongs in Cloud Cuckoo Land. The problem is 
that those 30 applications will come from different vendors; some may even 
have been written in-house. The applications will disagree in various ways, 
from data structure and definitions to security to hardware configuration. 
To make matters worse, technology keeps changing, so even if hard-and-
fast data definition standards were available, keeping them in step with the 
changing world would be a task and a half.
If you investigate the business applications in an organization of any size, you 
quickly discover that they, too, have a mess at the data level. The situation is 
no different with service management applications.
What can you do? The only viable solution is a federated one in which you 
have multiple data sources that can be coordinated so that they agree as 
much as possible. A picture is worth a thousand words, so see the diagram in 
Figure 9-2 for more details.

The important thing to understand about a CMDB system is that it records 
all the data it can about all the people, hardware, software, and data sources 
in the organization’s collection of IT assets and keeps that data up to date so 
that it can be used to support service management activities.
Integration infrastructure
Figure 9-2 contains too many elements to explain in one go, so we discuss 
them piece by piece, beginning with the integration infrastructure (see 
Figure 9-3).

The integration infrastructure is a process that allows any service management 
capability to access the entire service management data resource (which 
we’re calling the CMDB). The integration infrastructure is made up primar-
ily of communications capabilities and interfaces that enable a diverse set 
of data resources to appear as a single coherent resource (such as a single 
database).
The idea is that any service management application, or any person who is 
part of a service management process, can request information through the 
integration infrastructure and then retrieve the information.
As Figure 9-3 indicates, service management applications normally maintain 
their own data. Unfortunately, the processes that those applications serve 
may need access to other information. When members of the network man-
agement team are considering network changes, for example, they may need 
to know more about how applications in particular areas of the network func-
tion than they can find out simply from network management and monitoring 
software.
With the current state of technology, you can’t buy any product that consti-
tutes service management integration infrastructure in a box. If we’d wanted 
to, we could have written “here magic happens” rather than “integration 
infrastructure.” Don’t be deterred, however, by the fact that technology 

101
 Chapter 9: The Technical Foundation of Service Management
hasn’t yet reached the desired level of sophistication. Usually, when an over-
riding need exists, it’s possible to find ways to share service management 
data by using some form of data replication. The important point is to under-
stand that service management will be better automated and better served 
when the sharing of service management data can be automated reliably.
Asset management and discovery
Asset management is another IT term that can be applied to many things. In 
its widest definition, it can cover financial, contractual, and inventory func-
tions covering the life cycles of all software and hardware components. It can 
embrace license management and even such diverse activities as technology 
evaluation and capacity planning. We won’t discuss that topic here, however, 
because we’re interested in the activities involved in collecting all the data 
that service management activities require.
Figure 9-4 shows the service management applications that are involved 
in these activities. Taken together, asset discovery and asset management 
constitute an indispensable part of the foundational capabilities of service 
management.

Asset management application
The application in the top right corner of Figure 9-4 is the traditional IT asset 
management application, which allows you to record all the information you 
have about hardware and software. Most such applications also allow you to 
capture cost information, license information, and so on. Some applications of 
this kind even have the capability of exploring the network and may gather some 
information directly. If any application captures most of the basic information 
that needs to be held in the CMDB, it’s the asset management application.

102
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
Asset discovery application
IT networks used to be reasonably static, with data about new devices and 
software being captured as it was added to the network via the asset man-
agement application. Today, with the advent of wireless networks and cloud 
computing, the network can grow and shrink dynamically in terms of both 
the hardware it contains and the software it runs. Asset discovery software 
permanently listens to the network to detect changes, such as new devices, 
and then records those changes for use by other service management 
applications.
 
After an asset discovery application discovers new devices, authenticating 
those devices ought to be standard procedure.
Identity management
Identity management, as the words suggest, is the management of user iden-
tity information within the IT network. Identity management systems are 
relatively new. Before they existed, computer users simply had access capa-
bilities that were tied to their names and passwords. Users never had formal 
identities, and their access capabilities limited the applications that they 
could use on any given computer. A user might have single sign-on capability, 
in which his login gave him access to various computers on the network. In 
identity management systems, users have applications provisioned to them 
directly, and the identity management system looks after all the underlying 
logins. In that sense, identity management forms a bridge between single 
sign-on and the appealing idea of application self-service, in which users can 
select applications to use from a catalog.
Identity management can be regarded as the foundation of a good deal of IT 
security, as it naturally ties in with user authentication and user permissions. 
To learn a lot more about security, see Chapter 16.
For purposes of this discussion, however, we’re interested in identity man-
agement from a different perspective. Identity management is the single 
source of truth with respect to user information; thus, the data it stores 
becomes the best point of reference for service management applications 
that need user information.
In Figure 9-5, identity management data is shown as being an important part 
of the CMDB. Most of the data that an identity management system gathers 
is related directly to the applications that users (or customers) use. In some 

103
 Chapter 9: The Technical Foundation of Service Management
advanced implementations, the data is also directly related to the access 
devices (desktop computers, laptops, and mobile phones) that people use.

ment and 
the CMDB.

Unfortunately, many organizations don’t have full-fledged identity management 
systems, so they need to assemble much of the information that they need 
about users from directories and authentication systems. In those circum-
stances, it becomes difficult to establish a networkwide view of exactly who is 
doing what with any specific application. For security purposes and for calculat-
ing the cost of any given service, the ability to know exactly who is using what 
hardware and software assets for what purpose is becoming a requirement.
Configuration management
In addition to collecting information on people, hardware, software, and data, 
an organization needs to know as much as possible about the relationships 
among those elements to provide better service management. Luckily, it also 
needs to know most of this information to configure applications to run.
Configuration management data can be gathered by dependency mapping 
software that automatically parses the job control data that specifies how a 
given workload will run. This software identifies the data files and databases 
used by an application and can identify some of the dependencies among 
applications — at least, with the traditional application silos that have been 
deployed in data centers over the past decade. Configuration management 
software products normally go further than that, not only defining all work-
loads fully, but also tracking all changes made to any workload. As illustrated 
in Figure 9-6 and as their name implies, such products are often the prime 
source of information for the CMDB.

uration

The complexity of configurations became a little more complicated with the 
advent of enterprise application integration (EAI) technologies, which made 
it possible for applications to interact directly in ways that wouldn’t neces-
sarily be visible in workload. Then the situation deteriorated even further 
with the advent of service oriented architecture (SOA). In an SOA, details of 
services (which means application capabilities) are held in the SOA registry. 
Consequently, SOA dependency mapping also involves accessing that regis-
try to determine some of the dependencies among applications.
For more information on SOA, see Chapter 6. Alternatively, if you’re a real 
glutton for punishment, check out Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, 
2nd Edition (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), which we also wrote.
Federating the CMDB
You may notice that we present an incomplete picture in the preceding sec-
tions. We don’t explain how every single bit of the information that defines 
all the users, software, data, and hardware in a computing environment is 
assembled in a CMDB. All we do is identify the primary sources of important 
information that needs to reside in the CMDB. We do explain that the data the 
CMDB is supposed to contain is really distributed across multiple management 
databases that are used by a wide variety of service management applica-
tions. For that reason, we can really think only in terms of a federated CMDB.
In particular, we say very little about defining the inventory of data files that 
are held within any network. The truth is that the identity of data resources 
is in its infancy. Some applications, such as document management, define 
some data items very rigorously, and some important compliance rules 
involve certain kinds of data. But no service management application specifi-
cally gathers a comprehensive set of information about all data files.

105
 Chapter 9: The Technical Foundation of Service Management
The processes involved in populating and maintaining the CMDB are illus-
trated again in Figure 9-7. Aside from their other functions, the goal of these 
activities is to make a comprehensive, accurate set of data available to all 
current service management applications (including any that may be created 
in the future) and to staff members. With the current state of technology, this 
process isn’t well automated, so you can expect to see significant improve-
ments in this capability as time passes.
Having said that, it may help if we now take a brief look at how the CMDB fits 
into the strategic evolution of the data center and service management matu-
rity as a whole.

Strategy
The general strategic direction of service management, as we discuss in 
Chapter 6, is evolution from systems management to business service man-
agement. Most organizations today still focus on systems management, 
although many enlightened organizations are beginning to align the goals of 
the business with both service management (to manage application services) 
and business service management to focus on management’s needs.
An effective CMDB is necessary for business service management to be pos-
sible at all, because it requires comprehensive, up-to-date information about 
what is deployed.
Strategically, the CMDB is important because it’s the platform for all other 
service management applications. Therefore, improving this capability is a 
priority. Unfortunately, very few approaches to establishing and managing 
a CMDB have proved to be effective and have paid for their investment. The 
value of identity management, for example, lies in the improvements it makes 
in provisioning and IT security. The value of asset management is in the life-
cycle management of those assets. The value of configuration management is 
mostly in change management and in problem resolution. The fact that they 
can all improve the coherence of the data available to the CMDB is a welcome 
side effect.
Maturity
In Figure 6-2, in Chapter 6, we define the maturity of service automation in 
terms of this progression:
Fragmented services➪Standardized services➪Integrated services➪
Optimized services
As we state earlier in this chapter, an integrated CMDB isn’t technically 
achievable right now, so in terms of maturity, the primary and practical goal 
is likely to be a move toward standardized services.
We think that the first step is implementing those service management 
applications — asset discovery, asset management, identity management, 
and dependency mapping — that haven’t been put in place or aren’t com-
prehensively implemented. IT also has to develop an effective integration 
infrastructure to support bringing these pieces together. Such an infrastruc-
ture may involve communications products such as enterprise service buses 

107
 Chapter 9: The Technical Foundation of Service Management
(ESBs) and messaging products, as well as a protocol to enable interaction 
among disparate service management processes. We’re not aware of any 
commercial products that do it all.
Key performance indicators
With the CMDB, what matters most is to assemble data that can be shared 
among all service management processes. No specific key performance 
indicators can be applied simply to measure the level of data integration. 
Indeed, integration itself is difficult to measure in almost any context. It is 
more productive simply to note the level of disruption that the lack of inte-
gration imposes on service management and to work toward reducing such 
disruption.

Governing the Service Universe
In This Chapter
▶ Considering IT governance in context
▶ Striking a balance with business requirements
▶ Measuring performance
▶ Governing with best practices
You can’t implement effective service management unless IT takes a 
holistic approach to automation, oversight, and comprehensive asset 
management across the organization. How can you do this? We recommend 
establishing a strong IT governance program that can provide the framework 
to make this happen.
IT governance in service management requires carefully combining rules 
for IT and business processes. You need governance rules for everything 
from IT security to general policies about service levels. In essence, think 
of a life cycle of business processes that focuses on the goal of improving 
service quality and business agility. Governance from a service management 
perspective requires that your organization apply sound business and techni-
cal judgment. You have to make trade-offs. At times, you need to allow one 
service to degrade in favor of a more-business-critical service.
This chapter describes the importance of monitoring and measuring service 
performance, and discusses why IT governance requires companies to take a 
composite view of all the components of service management.
Understanding the Roles 
of IT Governance
IT manages a complex infrastructure of hardware, data, storage, and software 
environments. The data center (some of the largest organizations have many 

110
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
data centers) is designed to use all assets efficiently while guaranteeing a 
certain level of service to the customer or end user. A data center has teams 
of people responsible for managing everything from the overall facility, work-
loads, hardware, data, software, and network infrastructure.
 
To understand some of the complexities of service management from a data 
center perspective, we recommend reading Chapter 11.
In addition to the data center itself, your organization may have remote 
facilities with technology that depends on the data center. IT management 
has long-established processes for managing and monitoring individual IT 
components, which is good. What’s been a problem for many organizations 
is finding a way to monitor performance across all components in a way that 
reflects the overall impact of IT performance on the business.
Helping the organization meet its goals
You should direct IT governance at individual IT infrastructure components 
within the context of the larger challenges and goals, as well as within the 
company’s overall performance objectives.
 
IT governance is intended to help you meet the company’s overall perfor-
mance indicators.
IT governance is supported in two ways:
 
✓ Understanding the compliance and risk measures the business must 
follow: What does your business require to meet IT, corporate, indus-
try, and government requirements? IT can support these requirements 
through technical controls; automation; and strict governance of pro-
cesses, data, and workflows.
 
✓ Understanding the performance goals of the business: You may mea-
sure your business performance in terms of sales revenue, profitability, 
stock price, quality of product or service provided, and time to delivery. 
Your IT performance measurements should focus on delivering IT ser-
vices consistently and accurately so that the company gets to optimize 
its business performance.
Providing a view from the top
What’s one of the key benefits of taking a holistic approach to IT governance? 
When you have a comprehensive view, you can manage and deliver IT services 

111
 Chapter 10: Governing the Service Universe
more proactively. Imagine a chief information officer (CIO) who is frustrated 
by urgent calls from the company’s retail stores when terminals are slow or 
credit machines are unresponsive. The urgent calls always seem to come at 
the worst times, such as in the middle of a sale. Installing a remote service 
management system, however, would allow the CIO to do the following:
 
✓ Monitor the performance of all IT services in the retail environment
 
✓ Understand the relationships among those services
 
✓ Notice service degradations so that problems could be fixed before 
stores had to make emergency calls
In this example, the remote monitoring system enables IT to create a more 
balanced approach to delivering services based on business objectives and 
regulatory requirements. The CIO can develop a better understanding of 
the priorities involved when he makes decisions about service management 
issues for the retail stores. Many companies have started using an overall 
business service management strategy as a technique for managing services 
from a unified business perspective.
We give you a lot more detail on business service management in Chapter 17.
Improving efficiency
Each industry has a set of governance principles based on its regulatory 
and competitive environment. The most important governance requirement 
in retail, for example, is for the sales process to be both efficient and accu-
rate. What can happen in retail that becomes an IT governance challenge? 
Consider another example: Store operations management would like the data 
center to promise 100 percent uptime supported by fully redundant servers 
to protect against any service slowdown, but the CIO has cost restraints.
The CIO compromises with the business. Business management and IT man-
agement agree that customers shouldn’t wait more than three minutes to 
complete a transaction and that the sales kiosks must be up 96 percent of the 
time. In addition, they agree that all customer data must be fully encrypted 
and protected against unauthorized access by anyone at any time.
If the CIO later discovers that performance slows so dramatically that cus-
tomers leave stores without buying anything, IT governance has failed. If con-
sistently slow credit machines cause sales clerks to make credit card sales 
without using the automatic credit check, the business is put at risk, and 
IT governance has failed. On the other hand, if performance is excellent but 
customer data isn’t protected — you got it — IT governance failed again.

112
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
An integral part of IT governance is juggling various tasks: meeting customer 
expectations, optimizing business goals, recognizing resource constraints, 
and adhering to rules and requirements. We discuss this balancing act in 
more detail in the following section.
Balancing IT and Business Requirements
IT governance is a combination of the following:
 
✓ Policy
 
✓ Process
 
✓ Controls
 
✓ Consistent data about IT services
 
✓ The means to control those services
The role of IT governance is to do the following with service management:
 
✓ Implement
 
✓ Maintain
 
✓ Continuously improve
IT governance, therefore, has to include the techniques and policies that 
measure and control how IT systems are managed.
Defining your IT governance strategy is a balancing act. On one hand, it must 
focus on the key performance indicators of the business. On the other hand, 
it must balance all the components of the IT environment. You have to look 
at the relationships among IT and business components to fully appreciate 
the level of risk to your company.
Although at first glance, IT governance may seem to be a contained approach 
to providing oversight of IT resources, the range of issues that you must 
manage and plan is actually much broader. IT governance must be tightly 
woven with business goals and policies to ensure that services are optimized 
for customer expectations. As we point out in Chapter 1, however, everything 
in your business is really a service. Therefore, it isn’t surprising that we urge 
you to look at IT governance from a holistic business perspective.
 
Effective service management requires constant vigilance and intricate cho-
reography to ensure a balance among business priorities, customer expecta-
tions, available resources, and limitations on cost. IT is responsible for giving 

113
 Chapter 10: Governing the Service Universe
all internal and external customers and partners the resources they need, 
when they need them, without overstepping certain boundaries of resource 
and cost limitations. This focus has to be within the context of corporate 
governance requirements and an organization’s key performance indicators 
(KPIs). A philosophy focused on continuous improvement in service manage-
ment will help you optimize your IT infrastructure and business performance 
under the overarching umbrella of governance.
Measuring and Monitoring Performance
Measuring performance as a means to help improve performance is a con-
cept that is well understood by competitive athletes. Imagine the countless 
hours spent during training measuring, recording, and monitoring changes 
in time and distance. But what if the runner were taking steroids? Was she in 
compliance? Clearly, even if all other measurements were positive, breaking 
the rules changes everything.
How does this example apply to IT governance? The principle really is the same.
 
Although measuring and monitoring may help you improve performance, that 
performance is irrelevant if you don’t follow the company’s governance rules.
Measurement methods
You can measure business performance by comparing production, sales, 
revenue, stock price, and customer satisfaction with your goals. You can 
measure IT performance by comparing server, application, and network 
uptime; service resolution time; budgets; and project completion dates with 
your goals. Businesses use all these measures to rate their performance com-
pared with that of competitors and the expectations of customers, partners, 
and shareholders. But how can you measure the impact of IT performance on 
business results? It takes some fact-finding and true collaboration between IT 
and the business to settle on performance measures that support governance 
in service management.
A governance committee should answer the following types of questions to 
get started:
 
✓ How can IT performance measures support the business?
 
✓ What should management measure and monitor to ensure successful IT 
governance?

114
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
 
✓ Are customers able to get responses to requests in the expected amount 
of time?
 
✓ Is customer transaction data safe from unauthorized access?
 
✓ Can management get the right information at the right time?
 
✓ Can you demonstrate to business management that your organization 
can recover from anticipated outages without damaging customer 
loyalty?
 
✓ Are you able to monitor systems proactively so that you can make 
repairs before faulty services affect rules and regulations?
  
✓ Can you justify your IT investments to business management?
Proactive communication
Writing down key performance measurements is easy, but achieving them is 
complicated. Ironically, when IT manages services successfully from a busi-
ness perspective, the business doesn’t even notice. This outcome is like an 
old joke we like to tell:
Johnny was a quiet kid who never talked to his parents. One day he said, 
“This food is terrible!” His parents were shocked to hear his voice. “How 
come you never spoke before?” they asked. Johnny replied, “Up until now, 
everything was perfect.”
What’s Johnny trying to tell you? Maintain a clear dialogue with business 
management to understand what the business needs. When IT services are 
in perfect harmony with business objectives, you may never hear a word. 
But you certainly will hear many words loud and clear when a service failure 
leads to business disruptions. A much better policy is to take a proactive 
approach to demonstrate that IT management is paying attention. Good IT 
governance doesn’t happen by accident.
Making Governance Work
Having a lot of oversight and collaboration with the business is important, 
but it won’t be enough if you can’t meet your goals. You need to measure 
results by monitoring IT goals based on business goals, such as whether cus-
tomer complaints went down by 10 percent or the company increased sales 
by installing customer kiosks at all its stores.

115
 Chapter 10: Governing the Service Universe
In this book, we don’t focus on how well your servers are performing in your 
data center. The reality is that management cares about the business results 
and making sure that the supporting characters, such as the data center, do 
their parts.
Don’t get too comfortable, though: It isn’t enough to monitor performance in 
isolation. In the corporate world, many organizations advance performance 
and achieve compliance by increasing automation, but automating every-
thing makes it easy to lose sight of the human element in managing service 
the right way.
 
Standardization and automation help remove some risk and potential for 
error, but not all of it, because employees and other businesses stakeholders 
make decisions every day that put companies at risk. No amount of control in 
the health care industry, for example, ensures that patients will be given the 
correct medicines 100 percent of the time. The human element plays a big role 
in all governance issues.
Making governance work requires a combination of the following:
 
✓ Automation
 
✓ Optimization of processes
 
✓ Focus on KPIs
 
✓ Attention to the human element
This work sounds hard — and it is — but leveraging standards and best prac-
tices can help, as we discuss in the following section.
 
People and groups have countless opportunities to make mistakes — 
deliberate or unintentional — that interfere with adherence to corporate, 
industry, and government rules and policies. No company can expect technol-
ogy to correct for or protect against all instances of human error or fraud. 
Increasing use of IT service management in combination with increased stan-
dardization and automation of workflows, however, can help organizations 
govern with confidence.
Developing Best Practices
Putting IT governance into action by following industry best practices helps 
you manage IT services with greater control and consistency. To put IT 

116
Part III: Service Management Technical Foundation 
governance into action, your company should develop its own best practices, 
such as the following:
 
✓ Define the process flows. The process must do these two things:
 
• Involve both business and IT professionals at three levels: corpo-
rate, departmental, and IT.
 
• Measure how effectively each service delivers business value. 
This measurement helps you answer questions about meeting 
service-level agreements (SLAs), such as whether IT understands 
the business process well enough to set up SLAs that make sense 
and whether it can meet SLAs in such areas as mean time to repair.
 
✓ Identify the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved. Companies 
typically establish best practices by learning from mistakes. False starts 
in service management strategies are likely to be associated with inap-
propriate plans for change. You should know how you will implement 
a consistent change management process with tighter communication 
among all parties who need to know about the change. In addition, you 
should be proactive about change, such as requiring submission of 
notice about a service change early enough to decrease incidents associ-
ated with the change.
 
For more insight into the service management and IT governance strategies 
of real companies, we suggest that you read the case studies in Part V of 
this book.
The following sections discuss several important IT governance best 
practices.
Establishing a governance body
 
It’s important for IT to understand two things: the objectives of the business 
and the effect of service disruptions or outages on these objectives.
Creating a governance board consisting of representatives of corporate, 
departmental, and IT management will help encourage communication — the 
kind necessary to link IT service management and the business.
This governing body should be an ongoing concern that has authority across 
the enterprise and that has a mechanism for communicating business-
objectives changes to the IT folks who manage the services.

117
 Chapter 10: Governing the Service Universe
Monitoring and measuring 
IT service performance
Many companies implement a service dashboard, which holds the different 
services and shows how your performance measures up to your goals. In 
addition to leveraging the governance board (refer to the preceding section), 
your team can use the dashboard to answer the following types of questions:
 
✓ How are we performing according to our established KPIs?
 
✓ How does our performance now compare with last week’s or last year’s?
 
✓ What are the goals of our KPIs?
 
✓ What are we aiming for?
 
✓ Are rules and processes implemented correctly?
 
✓ Does each service meet technical standards?
Cataloging control and compliance data
Many organizations use a service catalog as a record of IT services. The cata-
log can include information like the following:
 
✓ Whom to contact about a service
 
✓ Who has authority to change the service
 
✓ Which critical applications are related to the service
 
✓ Outages or other incidents related to the service
 
✓ Information about the relationships among services
 
✓ Documentation of all agreements between IT and the customer or user 
of the service
A banking institution’s service catalog, for example, may contain information 
about the company’s online banking service, the KPIs for that service, and 
the SLAs between IT and the online banking business. If an outage occurs, the 
bank’s IT service management team can read the service catalog to locate the 
root cause of problems with the service.

Governance resources
Check out these organizations for information on 
how IT can collaborate with the business to 
improve service management and governance:
 ✓ The Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library (ITIL) for certification programs 
(www.itil-officialsite.com)
 ✓ The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) for standards on gov-
ernance (www.iso.org)
In addition to ITIL and ISO, many companies 
implement service management applications 
to automate and monitor IT controls. These 
applications can help companies ensure that 
the right IT controls are established to support 
the compliance requirements of regulations 
such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA).
For an introduction to service management 
standards and best practices, as well as more 
information on ISO, refer to Chapter 4. For more 
information on ITIL, see Chapter 5.

Part IV
Nitty-Gritty Service 
Management

In this part . . .
F
rom a practical perspective, the nitty-gritty is every 
service management process that we haven’t dis-
cussed yet. In this part, we take you on a journey from 
managing the data center to planning its evolution. In the 
course of this journey, you visit the desktop, mobile 
devices, data management, virtualization, the cloud, IT 
security, and business service management. It’s quite a 
journey, with many interesting stops on the way.

Chapter 11
Managing the Data Center
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the silo concept
▶ Optimizing and managing the data center
▶ Handling hardware, software, and work processes
W
e have spent a lot of time talking about the fact that a business itself 
is a set of services focused on achieving the right customer experi-
ence. In the case of an automated teller machine (ATM), the customer wants 
to walk up to the machine and in quick order get a wad of cash. If the cus-
tomer has the right card, the right security code, and enough money in the 
bank account, everything works like magic.
If only magic were possible! Reality is much more complicated. When we 
speak of managing the data center, what we really mean is managing the 
whole corporate IT resource — which, for the vast majority of organizations, 
has its heart in the data center.
In this chapter, we focus on the optimization of all the service management 
processes that constitute the operational activities of the data center. An 
inherent conflict exists between highly efficient use of assets and a guaran-
teed customer or user experience.
Understanding the Siloed Nature 
of the Data Center
A data center isn’t a neatly packaged IT system; it’s a messy combination of 
hardware, software, data storage, and infrastructure. The typical data center 
has myriad servers running different operating systems and a large variety 
of applications. In addition, many organizations have created multiple data 
centers over time to support specific departments or divisions in different 
geographic locations.

122
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
As long as hardware, energy, and physical space were relatively cheap, no 
one really bothered to think about the need to manage data center resources 
closely. If something broke, replacing it often was easier than figuring out 
where the problem was. If performance slowed, adding a couple more servers 
was a simple way to keep users from complaining. Over the past couple of 
years, however, three events changed everything:
 
✓ Data centers became expensive in terms of space and energy.
 
✓ The number of servers and other devices in use grew very large, making 
management of data and applications more complex and labor intensive.
 
✓ Compliance requirements, both external and internal, made oversight a 
business requirement.
Taken together, these events shifted organizations’ approach from manage-
ment of individual application silos (which could be added to the data center 
as new applications were requested) to overall management of data centers, 
based on the need to consolidate a broad set of services.
Organizations always had an incentive to optimize many aspects of data 
center activity, but the focus now is on managing a data center as a single 
coherent set of resources. This approach means managing a broad but 
poorly integrated IT ecosystem that spans the corporate supply chain from 
suppliers to customers while attempting to satisfy a series of competing 
demands, from the directives of corporate governance to energy efficiency.
Seeing the Data Center As a Factory
In many ways, you can think of a data center as being a factory. It resembles 
a factory in the sense that it has staff members who need to carry out regu-
lar, well-defined activities. It also has purpose-built machinery for process-
ing a regular scheduled set of work. From an organizational perspective, the 
management goals include ensuring the quality of processes, having very few 
breakdowns, and holding down costs. The efficient and effective operation of 
the factory is critical to the success of the business.
Differences exist between a data center and a traditional factory, however. 
Specifically, in a data center the raw material being processed is information, 
and the mechanisms that process this raw material are business applications. 
All the activities of the data center involve catering to the needs of those 
business applications so that they perform as expected and are available 
when needed. The various types of management software are the tools that 
help data center staff keep the production line in good order.

123
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
Figure 11-1 illustrates this idea, with the data center running various workloads. 
Because this figure fundamentally depicts how a data center operates, it may 
make managing a data center appear to be relatively easy. A multitude of pro-
cesses are involved, however.
Ultimately, what a data center does is run workloads. A workload is what it 
sounds like: a set of tasks required to meet customer or user demand (or 
possibly to complete tasks behind the scenes). As with everything else in the 
complex world of the data center, you find different types of workloads:
 
✓ Continuous workloads keep important business applications running all 
the time. An application that manages the transactions from hundreds of 
ATMs, for example, must run all the time.
 
✓ Scheduled workloads are put in place for tasks such as backups.
 
✓ Unscheduled workloads are intended to run only when a user requests 
service.

Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Optimizing the Data Center
Optimization is a balancing act. If you want to provide a specific service level 
for an application, you must devote enough resources to ensure that the 
service level will be met. If you provide too many resources, however, you 
waste some of them. If you had no financial constraints, you could provide 
all the resources anyone could possibly need to cater to every possible level 
of application activity. In such a world, every server could have a duplicate 
server just in case of an outage. You could give every department twice the 
storage it needed just in case data volumes grew at dramatic rates.
That approach wasn’t feasible even in the days of siloed computing, however, 
and it isn’t at all desirable if you want to get the best possible value from the 
computer resources that are deployed.
Optimizing an entire data center is far more complex than optimizing for a 
specific application. Many things can be optimized in a way that provides 
adequate support for defined service levels yet keeps costs down.
Figure 11-2 represents the service management processes or activities that 
inevitably take place in management of the corporate IT resource. The 
processes shown in the figure are the ones that are relevant to optimization 
activity.
The figure separates these processes into groups, or layers, that can be con-
sidered together. We drew the figure as though it were a network connecting 
many applications, because it is quite likely that service management appli-
cations will relate to most of the processes depicted here and connect with 
one another via integration infrastructure.
Optimizing the data center as a whole is complicated because all the 
capabilities — facilities, workloads, hardware environments, data resources, 
software environments, and the infrastructure itself — have traditionally 
been handled as independent disciplines. The data center is rarely managed as 
a single unified environment, and the different areas typically don’t orchestrate 
their activities.
The lack of integration generally is the result of explosive growth. IT manage-
ment never expected that data centers would grow so large, and many of 
the problems that now exist were mild irritations or nonexistent when data 
centers were much smaller. The structure of the IT organization, combined 
with the service management software in use, reflects this lack of integration. 
Just as there are application silos, there are service management silos. This 
reality is compounded by the fact that many data centers are running out of 
space or seeing their costs escalate uncontrollably.

Several distinct factors mandate a holistic approach to data center
management:
 
✓ Compliance, governance, and security requirements emanating from 
multiple sources
 
✓ Escalating power requirements and inefficient hardware use
 
✓ The advent of compelling virtualization technologies coupled with the 
need to implement them effectively to improve resource productivity

126
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Accelerated technology change (new technologies usually are difficult to 
integrate and tend to be disruptive)
 
✓ The automation of business processes across highly distributed envi-
ronments encouraged by the introduction of a service oriented 
architecture (SOA)
 
✓ The need for service management to manage processes to support 
corporate goals directly
The need for this approach is even more urgent than you may think, because 
the needs of businesses change constantly. An organization often has a net-
work of relationships with partners, suppliers, and customers that must be 
managed in a holistic manner. As companies become more and more depen-
dent on these networks, it is imperative to manage the underlying technology 
that supports them in a predictable and dynamic manner.
What organizations now want most from their data centers are efficiency and 
predictability: predictable costs, staffing levels, and performance service 
levels for IT users and customers bound together in an efficient integrated 
operation.
In Figure 11-2, earlier in this section, we present a set of service management 
processes. In the following sections, we discuss these processes and explain 
how they may participate in the optimization of data center activities.
Managing the Data Center
At the highest level, organizations have to take a businesscentric view of 
optimizing the data center. You may have the best-looking data center in the 
world, but if it doesn’t meet the performance needs of the organization or 
support the right customer experience, it will be a failure.
The top layer of Figure 11-2 (refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier in 
this chapter) is data center management, containing two processes: supplier 
management, and governance and compliance. These two activities tend to 
strongly influence all the activities in the layers below to some degree.
Supplier management
Supplier management is about determining and maintaining relationships 
and contracts with key IT suppliers. Depending on how much money your 
company spends with these vendors, you can establish significant discounts 

127
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
for both purchases and support. Normally, any given business area works 
with more than one vendor, using a secondary supplier to provide a credible 
negotiating position with the primary supplier, for example. The conundrum 
in supplier management is that commitment to one supplier’s strategic tech-
nology direction may make it impossible to implement alternative innovative 
technology in the data center when that technology comes from other sources.
Supplier management isn’t a technology-supported activity (beyond the use 
of office software) and isn’t likely ever to be well defined; generally, it’s an art 
form. Who can know which vendors and what technology will dominate the 
market in five years’ time? If the chief information officer (CIO) and his team 
are good at choosing technology winners and negotiating contracts, they will 
do well in this activity. The CIO might also work with vendors to establish a 
more predictable schedule for maintenance releases, patches, and back ver-
sion support. Normally, however, they also need the confidence and assistance 
of the chief financial officer and chief executive officer to acquit themselves 
well. The decisions they make determine or constrain many technology choices 
at lower levels, and these constraints need to be known and understood when 
decisions are made.
The key performance indicators (KPIs) for supplier management are expressed 
in terms of the unit cost of specific units of technology, the discount the 
company achieves against list price, and the actual useful life cycle of 
the technology purchased.
Governance and compliance
Governance and compliance is the other key issue that has a big effect on 
data center strategy and many data center activities.
Compliance
Depending on your industry and even your subsection of your industry, you 
need to focus on different compliance initiatives.
 
Compliance can be awkward because it imposes rules and processes that may 
be expensive and rarely pay for themselves. You may incur criminal penalties 
for failing to abide by some regulations. Your CEO won’t thank you when you 
tell her, as she walks away in handcuffs, that you saved thousands of dollars 
by ignoring regulations. For that reason, all compliance processes should be 
mandated by the board of directors, and all costs should be clear and visibly 
accounted for. The board will mandate specific costs and impose some 
constraints on how flexible some processes are, but these processes are 
mandatory.

128
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Governance
IT governance is about implementing, maintaining, and improving IT manage-
ment and support processes. In theory, it doesn’t necessarily involve automa-
tion, although in practice, implementing IT governance effectively is difficult 
without a good deal of help from software. IT governance involves setting 
policy in all areas of IT activity. Especially in highly technical areas such as 
software security, not automating the implementation of policy is ineffective.
In many areas of IT, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 
standards can be implemented with little variance, and the implementation 
of the standard can be partly or wholly automated. (For more information on 
ITIL, see Chapter 5.)
It would be ideal if all IT policies and processes could be defined in a central 
repository and their implementation automated with little human intervention. 
Reality is far from that ideal, but in most data centers, much more could be 
done in this area. Typically, only a few elements of IT governance are automated. 
We discuss governance in greater depth in Chapter 10.
Managing the Facility
The second layer in Figure 11-2 (refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier 
in this chapter) depicts service management processes that concern the data 
center facility as a whole. This layer contains three primary processes: asset 
optimization, facility management, and disaster recovery.
Asset optimization
This service management process is served by the asset management appli-
cation that we discuss as part of the service management infrastructure in 
Chapter 9. There, we focus on the need to capture accurate information about 
the assets that are deployed in the corporate IT network or possibly used on a 
cloud basis, which is part of what the application is intended to do. (We 
discuss clouds in Chapter 15.)
The application’s role is much bigger than just data gathering, however. Such 
an application also should be able to record and monitor the whole life cycle 
of any element of hardware or software, or combination of the two. In some 
organizations, this information is made freely available to at least some IT 
users so that they appreciate the costs and are able to calculate the return 
on investment associated with specific projects.

129
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
Ultimately, the IT asset management application (depending on what it does 
and how it’s used) can contribute information to many important activities, 
including the creation and implementation of specific policies or service 
levels. It can also help with the assessment of risk and with meeting specific 
performance objectives of the business.
All these activities can be counted as asset optimization activities of a kind. 
Multiple dimensions are involved in the use of any given asset; hence, other 
KPIs may be associated with asset optimization.
Traditionally, optimizing physical assets, such as in manufacturing environ-
ments, has been viewed as being entirely separate from optimizing digital 
assets. That situation is changing under the umbrella of service management. 
As IT begins to align more closely with business processes, the management 
of IT assets and business assets is likely to merge into a single activity. Data 
centers are becoming part of a larger ecosystem of service management; 
therefore, they need to integrate with sensor-based systems and process 
automation systems.
Facility management
Facility management is the activity of caring for and feeding the physical data 
center. It embraces everything from disaster protection (such as sprinkler 
systems and fire-retardant materials) to environmental controls (such as air 
conditioning and power management) to physical security.
Speaking of physical security, an increasingly important innovation is for 
organizations to tie their physical security (such as doors with passcodes) to 
a systems-based security system. If an employee is fired, for example, auto-
mated systems typically are in place to remove that employee’s passwords 
and prevent him from accessing systems. That same alert should trigger a 
change in the passcodes for the data center, as well as access to other 
physical environments that may need protection.
 
Significant economies of scale are involved in running a data center. When a 
data center runs out of space, the organization incurs a sudden, large, and 
unwelcome change in costs caused by the need to acquire a new, appropri-
ately built facility to house more servers, which will need communications con-
nections, power supply, air conditioning, security, and so on.
 
Data center space is the most expensive type of office space, so optimizing its 
use is important.

130
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
A good KPI for keeping an eye on facility costs and efficiency is average work-
load per square foot of floor space. There are many ways of defining workload 
in terms of hardware resources. Maintaining a KPI of this sort is useful for 
many purposes, particularly when you examine the cost of using a hosting 
provider or cloud computing (see Chapter 15).
Disaster recovery
The ability to recover from disasters is vitally important, and most organiza-
tions have rules of governance that dictate the provision of specific disaster-
recovery capabilities. If a disaster befalls the corporate data center, which has 
no disaster-recovery capability, the company is unlikely to survive. Therefore, 
having business continuity procedures is a necessity. From a service manage-
ment perspective, disaster recovery is a combination of the process, 
corporate policies, and readiness to act when the data center fails.
Disaster recovery can be expensive, especially in very large data centers with 
thousands of servers. Full disaster recovery mandates having an identical 
data center somewhere, ready to go into action immediately, complete with 
staff, operating procedures, preloaded applications, and up-to-data data. 
For most organizations, however, this plan is neither affordable nor feasible. 
Consequently, disaster-recovery plans normally provide for recovering only 
critical systems.
Disaster recovery can be complex, because as systems change and are 
upgraded, the disaster-recovery systems need to stay in step. The advent of 
SOA, for example, has posed some awkward problems for disaster-recovery 
systems. SOA-based systems typically are composed of services that are 
reused in different situations. Therefore, IT has to know the dependencies 
of these services across the organization. A related nuance is that disaster-
recovery systems are rarely tested and sometimes not tested at all until a 
disaster occurs.
Luckily, technology developments make it increasingly easy to provide disaster 
recovery through the use of either cloud services or dual sites, with each 
data center providing disaster recovery for the other. (For details on clouds 
and virtualization, take a look at Chapter 15.)
Like any other IT activity, disaster recovery involves optimization issues. A
company needs to link its service-level agreements and its asset optimization 
activities with the need for disaster recovery. As with everything in the 
service management world, compromises are likely to occur in terms of 
the disaster-recovery service-level targets and the necessary systems.

131
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
A disaster-recovery plan should cover issues such as e-commerce processes 
that touch suppliers and customers; e-mail, which is often the lifeblood 
of business operations; online customer service systems; customer and 
employee support systems; various systems that support the corporate infra-
structure, such as sales, finance, and human resources; and research and 
development. Depending on the company’s resources and income sources, 
management may need to consider other factors in a disaster-recovery plan.
Managing Workloads
The third layer in Figure 11-2 (refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier 
in this chapter) groups those processes that relate to managing workloads: 
from an IT perspective, managing the corporate IT resource. Being simplistic, 
we could say that you have applications that you need to run and resources 
to run them, so all you’re really doing is managing those workloads.
Useful facility-management KPIs
Other KPIs are likely to be useful. You can use 
the concept of a unit workload measurement, 
for example, based on calculating how an 
average application will behave with a typical 
or average level of service. For many years, Bill 
Gates thought of the power of a PC in terms 
of the Basic language compiler he once wrote 
as a measurement unit. We suggest that you 
do the same thing, using a typical business 
application.
Here are some KPIs that are likely to be worth 
tracking:
 ✓ Power costs (by unit workload)
 ✓ Average number of operational staff 
members (by unit workload)
 ✓ Average number of support staff members 
(by unit workload)
 ✓ Average software support costs (by unit 
workload)
 ✓ Average hardware support costs (by unit 
workload)
 ✓ Average data storage costs (by unit 
workload)
 ✓ Average server use (in terms of memory 
and CPU use)
 ✓ Average workload per square foot of 
floor space based on facility costs and 
efficiency
Keeping KPIs like these makes it possible 
to roughly allocate IT costs back to specific 
departments in the organization.

132
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
A few decades ago, in the age of the mainframe, workload management really 
was like that. It boiled down to scheduling jobs (often by writing complex job-
control instructions) and monitoring the use of the computer resource. In 
those days few, if any, workloads ran around the clock; thus, workload man-
agement was a scheduling activity involving queuing up jobs to run and setting 
priorities between jobs. Some workloads had dependencies — a specific 
outcome from one program might alter what needed to be done next — but 
all dependencies usually could be automated via the job-control language.
In today’s far more complex world, many more applications need to run, and 
many more computers exist to run them. Some workloads are permanent, 
running all the time. In most companies, e-mail is such an application. Quite 
a few companies also have Web-facing applications with resource require-
ments that can fluctuate dramatically. Virtualization capabilities make it 
possible (to some degree) to create virtual resource spaces. On its own, the 
World Wide Web increased the number of dependencies among applications, 
and when Web Services standards were created, the number of dependencies 
increased. SOA makes matters worse.
So workload management involves recording known dependencies among 
programs and applications — an activity that provides useful information to 
the configuration management database (CMDB), as noted in Chapter 9 — and 
scheduling those workloads to run within the available resources. This pro-
cess has to be flexible so that an application’s resources can be boosted when 
transaction rates escalate and reduced as those rates decline. In addition, a 
host of support functions have to run in conjunction with the business applica-
tions, including monitoring software and (where appropriate) backup jobs.
Application self-service
Increasingly, companies are giving users, customers, and partners direct 
access to applications that support everything from ordering to status inqui-
ries. Customers and users really like to be able to access these resources 
directly, but this type of direct interaction with applications complicates 
workload management because it makes predicting future workloads harder. 
Behind self-service applications, you need the usual well-orchestrated set of 
service management capabilities.
Application self-service normally is automatic — that is, whenever the user 
requests a service, the process happens instantaneously, without any human 
intervention. To realize this level of sophistication, application self-service 
has to have three processes happening behind the scenes:
 
✓ Identity management capability (to make sure that the user has the 
authority to access the application)

133
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
 
✓ A portal interface (to make it easier for the user to access specific 
components or data elements)
 
✓ Resource provisioning capability to execute the user request (to bring 
the requested application resource to the right place at the right time)
If you’re familiar with SOA, you may recognize the focus on components — 
and indeed, self-service applications are similar. Most SOA implementations 
work precisely this way. In such cases, services usually are recorded and made 
available in some sort of service catalog, perhaps called a service registry/
repository in SOA. This catalog may simply be a list of what applications 
a user can choose to run, and it may be automated to the point where the 
user simply selects a capability that is immediately made available through 
a portal. The service catalog could work in many ways, perhaps providing 
pointers to applications. If an application were sitting in a portal interface, 
the catalog could direct a user to that application.
 
If you want to know a lot more about SOA, we recommend that you take a look 
at Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). We think it’s 
a great book, even if we did write it!
One risk in implementing self-service capabilities is creating an unexpected 
level of demand for resources, especially when Web-based applications are 
readily available to customers. If a major weather situation causes custom-
ers to reschedule flights online, for example, airline systems may experience 
a major unanticipated spike in access. As more and more customers rely on 
self-service applications, the workload management environment supporting 
application self-service needs to be highly automatic and sophisticated.
IT process automation
Implementing an efficient flow of work among people working on the same 
service management activity and teams working on related activities is one of 
the primary keys to optimizing the efficiency of the data center. We refer to 
the design and implementation of these workflows as IT process automation.
It’s difficult to understate the contribution that the intelligent use of IT pro-
cess automation can make. We can draw a clear parallel between this process 
and integration infrastructure, which we discuss in Chapter 9. The function of 
integration infrastructure is integrating all the service management software 
applications so that they can share data effectively and don’t suffer the inher-
ent inefficiencies of silo applications. Similarly, the function of IT process 
automation is integrating service management activities and processes so 
that they work in concert.

134
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Workload automation
From the automation perspective, IT process automation implements work-
flows that schedule the progress of activities, passing work and information 
from one person to another, but it also involves integrating those workflows 
with the underlying service management applications that are used in some 
of the tasks.
To continue our analogy of the data center as a factory (refer to “Seeing the 
Data Center As a Factory,” earlier in this chapter), IT process automation is 
about designing the flow of activities so that they happen in a timely manner 
and keep the production line rolling, whether those activities involve fixing 
problems that have occurred or commissioning new hardware and software 
to add to the data center. The ideal situation would be not only to have all 
important service management processes occurring as automated workflows, 
but also to have a dashboard-based reporting system that depicts all the 
activities in progress in the data center, providing alerts if bottlenecks arise.
 
Such a reporting system could also report on the data center’s important KPIs, 
providing a real-time picture of the health of the whole data center.
Managing Hardware
Figure 11-2 (refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier in this chapter) 
groups the following service management processes on the hardware-
environment level:
 
✓ Desktop and device management
 
✓ Hardware provisioning
 
✓ Virtualization
 
✓ Network management
Most of these processes are discussed in other chapters, so except for the 
last two, we intend only to introduce them in the following sections.
Desktop and device management
The desktop traditionally has been managed as almost a separate domain 
by a separate team outside the data center, with the primary KPI being 

135
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
the annual cost of ownership (including support costs). This situation has 
changed recently, for two reasons:
 
1. Desktop virtualization is feasible now.
 
2. Increasing need exists to manage mobile devices — whether those 
devices are laptops, smartphones, or mobile phones — as extensions of 
the corporate network.
Hardware provisioning and virtualization
Traditionally, hardware provisioning was relatively simple. Hardware was 
bought, commissioned, and implemented with the knowledge that it would 
be designated for a specific application for most, if not all, of its useful life. 
Eventually, it would be replaced.
With the advent of virtualization, the provisioning of hardware became more 
complex but also more economical. Today, virtualization and hardware pro-
visioning are inextricably bound together.
Network management
Network management constitutes the set of activities involved in maintain-
ing, administering, and provisioning resources on the corporate network. The 
corporate network itself may embrace multiple sites and involve communica-
tions that span the globe.
The main focus of network management activity is simply monitoring traffic 
and keeping the network flowing, ideally identifying network resource prob-
lems before they affect the service levels of applications. In most cases, the 
primary KPI is based on network performance, because any traffic problems 
on the network will affect multiple applications.
An asset discovery application (which we mention in Chapter 9 in connection 
with the CMDB), if it exists, normally is under the control of the network man-
agement team because the application is likely to provide important data. 
The network management team is likely to work closely with the IT security 
team because members of IT security will be the first responders to any secu-
rity attacks that the organization suffers.
Recent innovations in network technology are likely to change some network 
management processes. Previously, for example, the capacity of a network 
was controlled by the capacity of the physical network. Now, major network 

136
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
technology vendors such as Cisco and Brocade provide highly sophisticated 
network switches that can be configured as networks in a box. These switches 
make it possible to virtualize a network to reduce or increase bandwidth. 
Suppose that you have an exceptionally large data warehouse that needs to be 
backed up. If you virtualize the network, this typically complicated process is 
simplified dramatically and made more efficient. In such a case, bandwidth can 
be increased to speed the task and decreased when the task is finished.
In the longer term, bandwidth is likely to be provisioned automatically, just 
as virtual servers are provisioned automatically.
Network management is about to become more complicated with the addi-
tion of unified communications. In the vast majority of companies, voice 
communications, videoconferencing, and other forms of collaboration are 
separate from IT systems. This situation is slowly changing, inevitably 
making network management more complex.
Voice over IP (VoIP) is in the ascendancy, and companies are gradually adopt-
ing it, although not always in highly integrated ways. Nevertheless, adoption 
of VoIP is a move in the direction of unified communications, in which e-mail, 
Short Message Service (SMS) messages, chat, voice communications, and all 
forms of collaboration become computer applications.
Managing Data Resources
Managing highly distributed data has emerged as one of the most important 
issues for service management. This task has always been complex because 
of the vast volume of data that has to be managed in most corporations. The 
problem is exacerbated when data is managed as a service across depart-
ments and across partners and suppliers.
We devote Chapter 14 to data management, so in the following list, we simply 
define the processes included in it, as illustrated in Figure 11-2 (refer to 
“Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier in this chapter). What has started to 
happen is that data itself has been packaged so that it can be transported 
with greater ease.
 
✓ Data services and data fabric: These processes move data around the 
network to make it available to the applications or services that need it 
(particularly business intelligence services).
 
✓ Storage management: This process manages data storage in all its forms.

137
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
 
✓ Database management: This process involves the specific tasks of 
managing database configuration and performance for critical 
applications and services.
 
✓ Backup and recovery: This process involves the management of backup 
and recovery, including the management of all dependencies among 
systems.
 
The primary KPI that an organization will want to measure is the cost per 
gigabyte of data stored in various strata of availability, from online to 
archived and stored.
Managing the Software Environment
The processes that we group on the software-environment level in Figure 11-2 
(refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier in this chapter) are covered 
elsewhere in this book, so we only introduce them here:
 
✓ Application management: This process normally involves specific soft-
ware designed to monitor the performance of a specific application. The 
activity could also be described as performance monitoring at the appli-
cation level.
 
✓ License management: The management of software licenses can be con-
sidered to be a separate activity or part of asset or supplier management. 
Either way, the primary KPI is expressed in terms of cost per user per 
application.
 
✓ Configuration change management: In its broadest definition, software 
configuration management covers the management of software releases 
and the management of changes in all configurations, complete with an 
audit trail (who did what, when, and how).
 
✓ IT security: IT security is a particularly complex activity, made more 
complex by the fact that currently, no security platform can be imple-
mented to provide comprehensive IT security across a network.
With respect to optimization, the ultimate goal in the corporate environment 
is to use software efficiently in terms of resource consumption while delivering 
agreed-on service levels at both the business level and the application level.

138
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Managing the Service Management 
Infrastructure
The final layer in Figure 11-2 (refer to “Optimizing the Data Center,” earlier 
in this chapter) is service management infrastructure, which we discuss in 
Chapter 9. In the following sections, we discuss two additional elements: 
cloud computing and service management reporting.
Cloud computing
A cloud is a computing model that makes IT resources such as servers, mid-
dleware, and applications available as a service to business organizations in 
a self-service manner. We include cloud computing in Figure 11-2 simply to 
indicate that workloads (or perhaps parts of workloads) may be run in the 
cloud. In fact, all the layers we discuss in this chapter could be augmented 
from the cloud. We expect that this approach will become necessary over 
time, as organizations migrate some of their applications to the cloud or sign 
up to run new applications from the cloud. For more information on cloud 
computing, take a look at Chapter 15.
Service management reporting
The idea of a central console initially grew out of the fact that in the old days 
of the mainframe, a single screen reported the progress of all workloads to 
the computer operator. That setup was impossible in large networks. Instead, 
several consoles aggregated information from various parts of the network. 
In addition, purpose-specific consoles reported on activities such as network 
management or IT security.
Integration infrastructure
A central service management reporting capability depends on a functional 
CMDB and integration infrastructure that support the gathering of data from 
multiple sources and the passing of messages among service management 
applications. Such a capability can exist even if only some level of integration 
is available.

139
 Chapter 11: Managing the Data Center
When this capability exists, it’s a relatively simple matter to add reporting 
software to provide specific reporting capabilities that give insight into the 
behavior of any part of the IT network. Such reporting capabilities can easily 
be added to the service catalog and made available to anyone in the data 
center as self-service options.
Understanding Strategy and Maturity
The general strategic direction for service management, as we describe in 
Chapter 6, is evolution from system management through service manage-
ment. This journey enables organizations to move from managing systems 
to managing the application services that run on those systems. The next 
stage of the journey is moving business service management (BSM) where it 
enables IT to be aligned with the goals of the business. As its name implies, 
BSM manages business services.
In this chapter, we look at the data center from an optimization perspective, 
highlighting various KPIs and specific areas of data center activity where 
optimization can be applied. Most of the optimization we discuss is already 
carried out within the data center in some way, in many cases informally. The 
nature of these optimizations will not change dramatically as an organization 
moves closer toward the goal of direct BSM, but the optimizations will have 
to be reconciled with the optimization of business services. When BSM is 
reality, it governs all other optimizations. We discuss BSM in more detail in 
Chapter 17.
In Figure 6-2 in Chapter 6, we define maturity in terms of this progression:
Fragmented services➪Standardized services➪Integrated services➪
Optimized services
As with strategy, the optimizations we discuss in this chapter are likely to be 
carried out in some way irrespective of the level of maturity. All such optimi-
zation activity becomes more effective as the industry moves to integrated 
services. The holistic optimization of the data center is possible only when 
the service management environment is fully integrated.

Chapter 12
Service Support and 
the Service Desk
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing what a service desk does
▶ Understanding event management
▶ Measuring service desk performance
O
ne of the fundamental truths of service management is that when you 
do it well, the service management team is like the wizard behind the 
curtain in the Land of Oz. If your e-mail never goes down and your technical 
equipment never fails, you don’t go looking behind the curtain to understand 
what went wrong.
The reality is that services do fail and errors do occur — and when they do, 
customers (or service users) need to have their questions answered and 
problems resolved. Whatever a problem is, it must be reported, diagnosed, 
evaluated, and fixed quickly.
This chapter defines the service desk, describes its parts, and explains its 
activity.
Watching the Service Desk 
in Action . . . or Inaction
For many businesses, the service desk is the first port of call in customer 
interactions. Imagine the lost productivity and revenue, and the all-around 
chaos, that would occur if companies didn’t have effective systems to manage 
IT service delivery and deal with problems effectively when they arose.

142
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Suppose that you manage a retail store for Poor Service Corp. You have 
10 point-of-sale (POS) systems, 15 phones on voice over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP), 5 customer kiosks, and several back-office PCs and servers. That’s a 
lot of technology that needs to be monitored and managed. Unfortunately, 
the service desk at Poor Service Corp. is inconsistent and disorganized. Users 
have a service desk number to call if the POS system or phone doesn’t work, 
but when a kiosk fails, they must call a different number for service, and if 
any of the PCs fails, they have yet another number to call. Nobody is quite 
sure why, but that’s how things work.
Everyone in your store avoids calling the service desk whenever possible; the 
desk workers often get things wrong on the first try and take a very long time 
to resolved problems. This type of service desk is inconsistent. In fact, one 
person who works at the service desk is very knowledgeable, but if he isn’t 
around to answer questions, the rest of the team members are a little lost.
Frustrated employees sometimes just move to a different POS unit when one 
fails, and by the time someone calls the service desk, an urgent problem has 
developed (such as the failure of several devices). Also, recent equipment 
failures indicate a lack of compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) — 
data security standards required by the credit card companies you work 
with.
Can you see where this scenario is heading? The service support process 
takes too long, costs too much, and leaves you providing poor service to 
your customers.
A properly functioning service desk does the following things consistently 
and quickly to meet customers’ service expectations:
 
1. Diagnoses a problem correctly.
 
2. Evaluates how to fix the problem.
 
3. Fixes the problem.
 
The ultimate goal of service management is to anticipate problems so that 
they never materialize and service desk calls are minimized.
Seeing How a Service Desk Works
A service desk provides a single point of contact for IT users and customers 
to report any issues they may have with the IT service (or, in some cases, 
with IT’s customer service).

143
 Chapter 12: Service Support and the Service Desk
Lest you think that a service desk is a one-size-fits-all proposition, let us 
assure you that service desks come in many forms and styles:
 
✓ The local service desk (departmental)
 
✓ The consolidated service desk
 
✓ The Software as a Service (SaaS) service desk model
The service desk may be merged with the customer service desk, for exam-
ple. The first responder to any call may be a call-center worker who isn’t 
employed directly by the company but who can respond to several common 
problems before passing the call on to the “real” service desk.
Goals of the service desk
A service desk has several objectives:
 
✓ Problem resolution: First and foremost, the desk is there to help 
resolve issues and problems as quickly as possible. This task involves 
not only recognizing and resolving relatively simple issues, but also 
prioritizing problems that may have a greater impact. An outage at an 
insurance-company system that provides quotes to potential custom-
ers, for example, may take higher priority than a problem with the part 
of the company intranet that provides information about the employee 
discount program. The service desk has to know what’s mission-critical 
and what isn’t.
 
✓ Service restoration: The service desk works to restore service as 
quickly as possible to maintain service-level agreements (SLAs). These 
SLAs often take some time to put in place and require a lot of negotia-
tion. Therefore, a key service desk role is ensuring that the agreements 
are enforced to the best of the company’s ability, which means tracking 
and monitoring service levels.
 
✓ System support: The service desk provides system support, which 
includes dealing with any incidents and problems, and may also involve 
dealing with issues such as change and configuration management.
 
Handling service desk issues takes a lot of activity. These processes include 
recording requests, assessing issues, routing requests, diagnosing and resolv-
ing the problem, tracking notification, and reporting, to name a few.

144
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Functions of the service desk
Many service desks deal with issues beyond incident and problem reporting. 
What actually happens inside the service desk can be fairly sophisticated.
A fairly comprehensive service desk may offer the following set of functions:
 
✓ Communication via multiple channels: The desk supports a wide vari-
ety of communication styles, including phone, e-mail, online forms, and 
even mobile communications. This communication is a two-way street: 
People can use the channels to report issues, and IT can use the chan-
nels to notify customers about the status and resolution of issues.
 
✓ Incident and problem management: The desk supports the assessment, 
prioritization, resolution, notification, and reporting of small incidents 
or major problems. An incident becomes a problem when it happens 
more than a few times. Management includes recording, routing, and 
resolving an issue; notifying interested parties of the status of the issue; 
and reporting on the issue.
 
✓ Change management: The desk supports the management of change 
requests, including information about how various parts of a system 
interact. Often, a system change actually causes an incident or a problem.
 
✓ Configuration management: The desk supports mapping of IT resources 
to the business processes that they support. Configuration management 
often entails the use of a configuration management database, which we 
describe in the sidebar “Providing visibility into your company’s infra-
structure,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Knowledge base: If service desk personnel don’t have the right informa-
tion to do their jobs, the jobs won’t get done efficiently or effectively. 
Knowledge management ensures that people get the information that 
they need to do their jobs correctly. Service management systems often 
link to a database that stores information about past incidents and how 
they were resolved; this database speeds incident resolution.
Managing Events
The event management process involves three simple steps:
 
✓ Event reporting
 
✓ Problem diagnosis
 
✓ Problem remediation and verification

145
 Chapter 12: Service Support and the Service Desk
We cover all these steps in detail in the following sections.
Reporting on events
The service desk receives notifications of events (issues) via phone, fax, 
e-mail, Web, and mobile devices or directly from automated monitoring capa-
bilities deployed within IT systems. Then it attempts to solve the underlying 
problems, normally by passing details of the event to the support staff.
Figure 12-1 illustrates the processes by which incidents are reported to the 
service desk:
 
1. An incident report comes from either of two sources:
 
• Customers or employees
 
• Monitoring software that raises automatic reports
 
2. The service desk immediately resolves any well-known issues, such as 
lost passwords or PC hardware failures.
 
 The vast majority of issues reported don’t involve sophisticated diagnosis.
 
3. The service desk generates a trouble ticket summarizing everything that 
is known about the event
 
4. The problem moves into the diagnosis phase.
Diagnosing problems
Most service desks began as help desks that dealt reactively with incidents 
and problems, which remain important support issues. Two core service 
desk features are worth looking at, however.
Think of an incident as being an event that somehow interrupts or negatively 
affects the quality of a service. Front-line support staff can handle many rela-
tively simple events, such as a printer failure or an employee’s inability to 
reset his password, but they also have to determine when an event is a seri-
ous incident and deal with it effectively.
Figure 12-2 illustrates how a service desk typically manages and diagnoses 
incidents.

Consider an example that shows how the process works. Janice works at the 
service desk of an electronics company. When she finishes her coffee and 
logs into her incident management system in the morning, she sees a helpful 
user interface tailored for her job. What does she see? Typically, this screen 
displays all the incidents she’s dealing with, alerts about outages, some 
status reports, and a function that allows her to create a new incident report.
When the phone rings, Janice picks it up. Someone in the customer service 
department says that his printer isn’t working. Janice must create a new inci-
dent trouble ticket. Because this kind of incident happens all the time, her 
service desk has templates for it. She asks the user his name, and she pulls 
up information about him and the printer to which he has access. The infor-
mation about these particular assets is stored in the all-important configura-
tion management database (CMDB) so that she can actually see the type of 
printer that isn’t working. (See the nearby sidebar “Providing visibility into 
your company’s infrastructure” for more information on CMDBs.)

148
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Because the customer service department gets high priority at her company, 
Janice wants to deal with the problem right away. She asks the user what 
the error message is; then she pulls up her knowledge base and accesses 
possible solutions to this particular problem. Voilà — one of these solutions 
works, and she’s done with that particular issue.
Next, she gets an e-mail from someone in sales who says that one of the com-
pany’s product-ordering Web pages is degrading steadily. Janice creates a 
trouble ticket for this problem. The system automatically generates a sever-
ity code of 1 (meaning that the problem has to be dealt with immediately) 
and routes the ticket to Sarah, who’s part of the Web site engineering team. 
Then Janice goes back to reading reports on other open incidents.
 
If multiple events of the same type occur, or if multiple events occur that 
appear to be related to the same underlying problem, in theory these events 
ought to fall into just one trouble ticket. In reality, however, the connection 
among events may be clear only to a subject-matter expert, so service desk 
staffers have to be aware of all open trouble tickets and their status.
Remediating and verifying problems
To continue the example from the preceding section, the trouble ticket goes 
to a specific support area where the problem is identified. After the problem 
has been fixed, its resolution is verified. Only at this point is the solution 
implemented.
Providing visibility into your 
company’s infrastructure
A configuration management database (CMDB; 
see Chapter 9) contains information about all of 
a company’s assets that make up the informa-
tion system infrastructure. These assets are 
often referred to as configuration items (CIs). 
These items may be servers, laptops, network 
elements, applications, and so on. In addition to 
this information, the CMDB may hold informa-
tion about known errors, incidents, problems, 
changes, and release information. An impor-
tant function of a CMDB is tracking changes in 
these items, because these changes can affect 
service.
The CMDB is an organization’s information hub, 
holding all the relationships of system compo-
nents. The idea of an information repository for 
information assets has been around for years, 
but with the growing importance of service 
management and the Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library (ITIL), it has gained more 
steam. (For details on ITIL, see Chapter 5.)

Suppose that performance degradation has been reported in some application. 
The problem could stem from any of the following issues:
 
✓ Configuration management: Someone made an error while changing a 
configuration.
 
✓ Change management: An implemented software patch caused the problem.
 
✓ Network: The network gets overloaded when California wakes up.

150
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Desktop or device: Someone overloaded her PC, causing slow 
communications.
 
✓ Database: A database table needs to be optimized.
 
✓ System management: A server’s processors failed.
 
✓ IT security: A denial-of-service attack is in progress.
 
✓ Application: A program has a bug.
The truth is that just about any area of service management can be involved 
in one way or another. Figure 12-3 indicates this possibility via the link from 
the CMDB to the integration infrastructure.
Suppose that Janice, on the service desk, passes a trouble ticket to Sarah, on 
the Web site engineering team. Sarah investigates the problem. She deter-
mines that the performance problem has to do with a server resource issue 
and that the server needs an upgrade (or that the Web site application needs 
a larger server). In the service management system, she notes the nature of 
the problem and the fact that this new server will be provisioned that day. 
She also updates the data on this problem and its solution in the knowledge 
base for future reference.
If someone in sales calls the service desk again, the desk will have a complete 
record of the whole event; it can report what the problem is and when it will 
be fixed.
Using the war-room technique
Occasionally, a problem comes up that stumps 
everyone. What’s the cause? In this chapter’s 
running example, the service desk employee 
knows who can best deal with the vast majority 
of problems, but she isn’t sure exactly where a 
certain problem lies. Worse, the problem is a 
serious one that needs to be handled quickly 
because key service levels are being threat-
ened.
Sometimes, performance problems are of that 
ilk. The problem may be in a database, in appli-
cation software, in middleware, in the network, 
in server hardware — or in some combination 
of these elements. If the service desk simply 
passes the problem on to one of the teams that’s 
responsible for one of these areas, that team 
may decide that the problem lies elsewhere and 
pass it back. The process can be repeated over 
and over, with the problem never being properly 
addressed.
The war room is designed to prevent such an 
outcome. It involves having members of all rel-
evant support teams meet to form a short-lived 
group that resolves the problem collectively by 
analyzing it from every angle and determining 
a plan of action. Ideally, such a team can use 
the information-gathering capabilities of every 
team member.

151
 Chapter 12: Service Support and the Service Desk
Verification
The top of Figure 12-3 shows four processes involved in verification:
 
✓ Governance and compliance
 
✓ Provisioning
 
✓ Testing environments
 
✓ Backup and recovery
Sometimes, you know that a given action definitely solves a problem, as is 
often the case when hardware fails. The hardware is replaced, and the problem 
is solved immediately.
In the following circumstances, you must recover the application before 
implementing the solution:
 
✓ When the support engineer doesn’t know for sure that a given solution 
will resolve the problem — and could make the problem worse
 
✓ When data has been corrupted
 
Suppose that you can’t solve a problem the way you thought you could. First, 
make sure that the right people do the following things with any changes:
 
✓ Evaluate and authorize
 
✓ Record
 
✓ Test and validate
 
Standard processes are key in remediation and validation. If you don’t have 
these processes in place, you’ll never be able to keep track of anything. Also, 
the processes for remediation and verification are often defined as part of gov-
ernance practice. (For more information on governance, refer to Chapter 10.) 
Make sure that you log everything you do to resolve a problem, including all 
attempts to solve it.
Tracking Service Key 
Performance Indicators
 
It’s important that services, even relatively unimportant ones, have defined 
service levels. If you look at a service level another way, it’s a key performance 
indicator (KPI).

152
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
A nurse may need access to patient records around the clock for example, 
so the system that supports records management and delivery needs to 
meet this criterion. On the other hand, a human resources system that lets 
employees see how much they’ve spent for out-of-pocket medical expenses 
may not be as critical, so a 24/7 service level would be unlikely.
Negotiating SLAs is often a dance between IT and the business. Some service 
levels are non-negotiable, such as the mission-critical one outlined in the pre-
ceding paragraph; others have more wiggle room. IT and the business must 
work together to establish these SLAs.
 
Typical SLAs include the following:
 
✓ Response times (possibly varying by transaction)
 
✓ Availability on any given day
 
✓ Overall uptime target
 
✓ Agreed-on response times and procedures in the event that a service 
goes down
Change and configuration management
Very often, application performance failures are 
caused by recent changes, either in programs or 
in software or hardware configurations. Changes 
affect service levels, sometimes positively and 
sometimes negatively, and a change in one part 
of a system can easily affect downstream parts of 
the system (or even other systems).
Statistics suggest that many performance 
problems and system failures stem from errors 
made when configurations are changed. 
Consequently, change and configuration man-
agement are moving under the purview of the 
service desk.
The change management process ensures that 
standard procedures are used to handle all 
changes to prevent negative effects on service 
quality. Configuration management provides a 
logical model of the infrastructure or a service 
by identifying, controlling, maintaining, and 
verifying the configuration items. The idea is to 
understand the relationships among all the ser-
vices that are part of the enterprise. That way, 
if one service has a problem, you have a good 
idea of how the problem may affect another 
service.

153
 Chapter 12: Service Support and the Service Desk
Service-level metrics
When the agreements are in place, you must manage and track them. These 
service-level metrics or KPIs are stored in either of two places:
 
✓ The SLA management system
 
✓ The CMDB
 
Some service desk systems can link to the availability monitoring systems 
to confirm that mission-critical systems are identified and monitored as part 
of the SLA management process. This system helps IT prioritize issues and 
ensure that the right resources are allocated. Often, this monitoring can be 
done at the individual user level. The service-level management system can 
also link to the incident, problem, change, and configuration management sys-
tems to provide visibility into these functions. Typically, these systems also 
provide reports that outline certain SLA metrics for end users.
Service desk metrics
The KPIs for the service desk itself are expressed in terms of problem reso-
lution. Ideally, incidents are classified according to type, and three specific 
times are recorded:
 
✓ Time to identify problem: In some circumstances, a problem may exist 
for a long time before it is reported, indicating that monitoring systems 
may need to be reviewed.
 
✓ Time to diagnose: This metric is the time between an event report and 
the identification of the cause of the problem.
 
✓ Time to fix: This metric is the time between diagnosis and system repair 
or resumption of service.
The analysis of the performance of the service desk and the support teams 
against these KPIs needs to be carried out intelligently. Culturally, it is impor-
tant to encourage employees to report incidents and to continually improve 
the process of managing problems.
Also, comparing one month with another may not be comparing like with 
like. If everyone’s using a new version of an operating system, for example, 
the number of incidents at the service desk may rise simply because of the 
operating-system change. Yet it may not be possible to revert to the older 
software (because it’s no longer supported, for example).

Desktop and Device Management
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the client management universe
▶ Understanding the five process areas of client management
▶ Moving from physical to virtual computers
▶ Fulfilling service-level expectations
A
 long time ago, before laptop computers, personal digital assistants 
(PDAs), and cellphones, life on the desktop side was very peaceful. 
Customers all had terminals on their desktops that were more or less directly 
connected to a central computing resource. There was no user software to 
upgrade; there weren’t many applications; user support wasn’t too demand-
ing. The only color that IT had to worry about was the pleasant green of the 
mainframe terminal.
But one day, a big, disruptive event occurred: The personal computer broke into 
the organization. Users were delighted with this sparkling new productivity tool, 
but they weren’t particularly adept at taking care of it or even backing up the 
precious data that they created on it. Even when these wonderful devices 
were networked in local area networks, their management generally was the 
responsibility of each department and had little or nothing to do with IT.
The PC was enormously successful. Having delivered personal productivity 
applications, it displaced the mainframe’s green screens and then became 
the platform for many client/server applications and networked applications 
such as e-mail and file sharing. At that point, the world of desktop manage-
ment changed dramatically because it had to. The PC became the device 
through which most employees conducted business. The costs of local ad 
hoc support of PCs got out of hand, and companies had a clear financial 
reason to start managing desktops centrally.
With the passage of time, however, technology use grew, and companies had 
much more than just desktops to manage. Many users suddenly found a need 
for laptops so that they could work on the road. Workers began using hand-
held devices to measure and report on conditions on the factory floor. PDAs 
and cellphones soon had as much computer power as ancient mainframes. 
All these devices became part of the overall service management fabric.

156
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
In this chapter, we look at the importance of managing the desktop and the 
myriad devices that customers require to get their jobs done. We also look at 
management requirements and how desktop and device management fit into 
the overall service management environment.
Clients, Clients Everywhere . . .
Companies are at different stages of maturity when it comes to managing 
desktops and devices. At one end of the spectrum, client management is frag-
mented and reactive; organizations at the other end have automated client 
environment management to the point where PC applications are provisioned 
and patched automatically, and the PC environment is centrally controlled.
The flow in Figure 13-1 could apply to any company regardless of its current 
maturity; the chart shows the whole client management universe, including 
all processes that have to be carried out (whether they’re automated or not). 
The processes discussed here are, in most cases, similar to the data center 
processes discussed in other chapters. The reality for most organizations is 
that the client environment is managed quite separately from the data center, 
with a separate support staff. For efficiency reasons and because the technology 
to enable it is improving fast, the management of the two domains will become 
more integrated in coming years.
Figure 13-1 shows client management consisting of a service’s three funda-
mental elements:
 
✓ People/organization: The staff members in charge of the client manage-
ment activities, including those implementing policy and troubleshooting. 
This group could include anyone from the person who stops by your desk 
to fix a PC when it goes wrong to employees in the data center monitoring 
the cost of computer assets.
 
✓ Processes: The organized activities involved in client management, 
including governance, assets, changes in security rules, and configuration 
changes.
 
✓ Technology: The supporting technology that helps manage client opera-
tions within the business. That technology could include patch manage-
ment software, license management software, security software, and a 
host of other support applications.
 
 Don’t get suckered into thinking that you can improve client management 
simply by changing technology.

Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Dividing Client Management 
into Five Process Areas
Look at the five process areas for successful client management illustrated in 
Figure 13-1 (in the preceding section):
 
✓ Asset management: No matter what the client environment is (cellphone, 
BlackBerry, laptop or desktop PC, Windows, or Mac), activities within 
that container need to be registered, monitored, and tracked based on 
both the hardware itself, the software that runs on the platform, and the 
use that is made of it by various groups of users.
 
✓ Service monitoring: Activities in this process area monitor what’s hap-
pening at each client, as well as the tasks required to maintain the right 
level of service. The service desk provides coordination for monitoring.
 
✓ Change management: Activities in this process area involve managing 
and implementing all changes in applications and hardware. This area 
may include configuration management for applications that span the 
client and the data center, as well as license management.
 
✓ Security: Activities in this process area involve securing the whole client 
domain against external threats and authenticating which users can get 
into which facilities. Security may involve locking down administration 
capabilities and proactively managing the storage and backup of data files.
 
✓ Integration/automation: Activities in this process area aim to standardize 
all client management processes so that they work together to improve 
overall service, enhance overall governance, or reduce costs.
Each group of processes may be served by multiple software products and 
may be carried out by different groups in client management. All five process 
areas are carried out in some way in all organizations, with varying levels of 
sophistication. Most companies have some way to keep track of devices, for 
example; the tracking mechanism may be anything from a simple spreadsheet 
or an automated system that discovers all new devices as soon as they 
connect to the network.
As organizations mature, client management has to become business-driven 
rather than technology-driven. Consequently, a good way to begin improv-
ing client service management is to automate the technical management of 
the client so that it’s largely invisible to users. Where you start depends on 
where you are, but taking all responsibility for PC administration, application 
provisioning, and IT security away from users is an intelligent goal.
The following sections cover the five process areas in detail.

159
 Chapter 13: Desktop and Device Management
Asset management
Desktop and device asset management helps you select, buy, use, and main-
tain desktop hardware and software. What must you do to manage desktops 
and mobile devices thoroughly? Here’s a list of necessary activities:
 
✓ Establish a detailed hardware asset register. A register is a database 
that itemizes hardware assets and records all the details. It lets you analyze 
hardware assets (including peripherals) and provides a foundation for 
many user services, including provisioning and security. It also may be fed 
with information by asset discovery software.
 
✓ Establish a software register. A software register tracks all the software 
elements of devices. It complements the hardware register and offers a 
foundation for better automated provisioning of software.
 
✓ Control software licenses. Some users may be able to add new software 
to a desktop or mobile device, either because they have administrator 
capability or because some application self-service has been implemented. 
Controlling a glut of software is a difficult task. Watching software licenses 
reduces costs and efforts; it also eliminates the risk that the company will 
be running more versions of software than it has paid for.
 
✓ Manage device costs. By tracking device use, you can reduce redundan-
cies, as well as maintain hardware more efficiently. Often, companies 
have devices that are no longer used but that still require time and effort 
to maintain.
Service monitoring
The client environment is one of the most vexing problems for IT management. 
Where client support is not well integrated with data center support, good rea-
sons exist to establish an integrated support service. Then client monitoring 
goes beyond identifying a problem with a mobile or desktop device: The 
support service is driven by the data center’s trouble-ticketing system, which 
tracks a problem to its resolution and quickly identifies situations in which 
the data center applications are the cause of the problem.
You can also support users by putting these components in place:
 
✓ Automated client backup: An automated backup system reduces the 
risk of data loss and speeds recovery times when failures occur. The sad 
truth is that most users simply don’t have the discipline to manage their 
own backups, and a simple disk crash on a PC or laptop usually results 
in the loss of important data. (For more information about data loss and 
recovery time, see Chapter 14.)

160
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Remote management and maintenance: Because users may be spread 
around the country or the globe, service providers must be able to 
manage both client hardware and software remotely.
 
✓ Client recovery: Normally, this task involves restoring data from auto-
mated backups, but it also can involve reconfiguration or a software 
upgrade, depending on the problem diagnosis.
 
✓ Root-cause analysis: Many monitoring products place a software agent 
on the client device to capture the behavior of the hardware and soft-
ware in real time. Simply knowing whether a failure is caused by hard-
ware or software leads to faster recovery. The more information you can 
gather about CPU, memory, and application resource use, the easier it is 
to diagnose a problem.
 
✓ Application monitoring: Users are quick to blame IT when the perfor-
mance of their applications is poor. Poor performance can have a mul-
titude of causes, one of which is simply that the client device doesn’t 
have enough power. Consequently, IT needs to be able to monitor client 
device performance based on actual application use. Application moni-
toring helps determine whether a performance problem can be resolved 
simply by a device upgrade.
 
✓ Service-level maintenance: Service levels should be applied both to 
hardware and applications running on client devices. Unless these service 
levels are defined accurately, they can’t be monitored effectively. Because 
client management is an integral part of overall data center management, 
it can’t be viewed in isolation. Service-level maintenance becomes even 
more important as organizations virtualize the client environments within 
the data center. (For more information on virtualization, see Chapter 15.)
Change management
 
Managing change means that you have to provide standardized processes for 
handling IT changes. Because the client device environment often lacks the 
centralized service management control that is typical in the data center, it 
can become the weak link in service management.
You should meet these key requirements for handling client-focused change 
management:
 
✓ Hardware provisioning: Rapid deployment of devices minimizes the 
time needed to support staff changes. New staff members have to be 
provisioned just as quickly as those leaving the organization.
 
✓ Software distribution and upgrade: Being able to distribute changed 
software to devices across the organization is mandatory in tight financial 
times. Many companies create a standard desktop client environment that 
facilitates distributing and changing software.

161
 Chapter 13: Desktop and Device Management
 
✓ Patch management: Patches are changes to software that are made to fix 
bugs rather than changes that upgrade software functionality. When well 
automated, patch management minimizes the impact of patch implemen-
tation while reducing the risk associated with the bugs that are being 
fixed. Many such fixes address IT security problems.
 
✓ Configuration management: This process lets your company automate 
the configuration settings in a desktop software environment, making it 
easier to manage the client environment. Specifically, it manages which 
applications are loaded and may include IT security settings that provide 
or deny administrative capabilities (see the following section).
Security
 
Ensuring the security of every user access device in a company can be tough. 
Even when IT sets up security, outside software can easily creep onto devices — 
particularly laptops and mobile devices, which are difficult to bolt down. 
Moreover, it’s possible nowadays to run applications from a memory stick or 
thumb drive and to plug a variety of devices into USB ports.
Safeguard your access devices by using these approaches:
 
✓ Secure access control: This approach may involve just password con-
trol, or it may involve more sophisticated (token-based or biometric) 
authentication. Secure access control reduces security breaches.
 
✓ Identity management: Identity management defines the user in a 
global context for the whole corporate network. It makes it possible to 
link users directly to applications or even application functions. This 
approach delivers networkwide security, associating permissions with 
roles or with individual users.
 
✓ Integrated threat management: Normally, you have to counter a variety 
of security threats through several security products, both on the client 
and in the data center:
 
• Virtual private networks secure remote communications lines for 
using PCs from home or from remote offices.
 
• Intruder-detection systems monitor network traffic to identify 
intruders.
 
• White-listing products limit which programs are allowed to run.
 
✓ Automated security policy: Ultimately, with the right processes and 
technology, you can manage some aspects of IT security to some degree 
via policy. Some products manage logging activity so that the activities of 
all users throughout the network are logged, for example. Also, you can 
define policies within identity management software to designate who has 
the right to authorize access to particular services or applications.

162
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Integration/automation
Integrating good client management into the overall service management 
framework can be complicated. Organizations are dealing with a variety of 
client environments, ranging from fully functional PCs to virtualized clients 
and wireless devices. To meet service levels, client management must be 
predicable and consistent.
Key ingredients in this approach include the following:
 
✓ Standards: Adopting client management standards precedes and pre-
pares for all other integration work and enables greater flexibility over 
time. By standards, we mean standards in every layer of technology 
from hardware (standard PC models using standard components from 
the keyboard to networking cards) through communications and data 
access to client applications. The important point to understand is that 
when you deviate from any agreed-on standard, you risk increasing the 
number of points of failure and create potential integration problems. 
In recent years, most in-house software development has adopted Web 
Services standards, which has made it far easier to link applications 
both on clients and on servers.
 
✓ Management by policy definition: The ideal is to implement client man-
agement simply by defining policy directives in software and having them 
obeyed. Technically, reality is a long way from the ideal. It’s possible, 
however, to enforce some rules directly in software (such as patch and 
configuration management software), and some software can be used to 
help automate compliance and governance. The better the implementation 
of service management capabilities becomes, the more feasible it is to 
move toward management by policy.
 
✓ Governance and regulatory compliance: Compliance often delivers 
side-effect benefits beyond simply being able to prove that IT operations 
are compliant when they’re audited. One benefit may be that you can 
better meet internal audit requirements and, by analyzing some of the 
data gathered, gain deeper insight into the client domain. Specific ben-
efits depend on your country and your industry.
 
 In many industry sectors nowadays, organizations have to abide by 
specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the health care sector. Nearly all such reg-
ulations affect IT because they mandate a duty of care for customer data, 
and penalties are applied if these regulations are violated. Consequently, 
they’re not optional. Luckily, however, many of these regulations are 
a boon because they mandate sensible IT practices, and companies 

163
 Chapter 13: Desktop and Device Management
rarely object to funding the necessary technology to meet compliance 
demands. (For more detailed information on compliance, see Chapter 10,

You can’t do much to improve management of mobile devices (after you’ve 
integrated solid management processes, that is), but the same isn’t true of 
managing desktop PCs. Most desktop expense lies in support: managing the 
PC population (software upgrades and the like) and fixing things when they 
go wrong.
 
In a typical enterprise situation, the annual support cost per PC is anywhere 
between three and five times the cost of the PC. Because PCs are outdated 
about every four years, the actual cost of ownership can be anywhere from 
9 to 20 times the cost of the PC itself.
 
Although securing a good purchase price for PCs is important, keeping owner-
ship costs under control is far more important. Keep costs low through effec-
tive automated desktop management processes. Bring the costs down even 
further by moving the desktop into the data center, so to speak.
Moving the desktop into the data center covers every possible means of 
replacing physical PCs with graphics terminals (also known as thin clients; 
see the nearby sidebar “Thin is in”). You can make these replacements in 
four ways, each of which is described in the following sections:
 
✓ Session-based computing
 
✓ Operating-system streaming
 
✓ True client virtualization
 
✓ PC blade
Thin is in
Thin client is another name for a graphics 
terminal. The name comes from the fact that 
such devices — although they’re computers 
with CPUs, memory resources, keyboards, and 
mice — aren’t PCs in the sense that they don’t 
have disks or DVD drives. These devices also 
run an operating system, but the OS is used 
purely to emulate the user interface of a PC.

164
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
You could loosely describe every one of these techniques as being client 
virtualization, because in each technique, the PC is controlled from the data 
center (not from the desktop). In practice, however, only one of these tech-
niques is based on true virtualization, which is the use of software to emulate 
a computing environment within another computer. Client virtualization 
involves emulating a whole PC in software on a data center server and dis-
playing the user interface on a graphics terminal. Computers have become 
powerful enough to do this, and users are unlikely to be unable to detect the 
difference between client virtualization and a desktop PC.
All these arrangements simplify PC management considerably by making the 
following tasks easier:
 
✓ Enabling immediate setup of a new virtual PC if an actual PC fails
 
✓ Applying new patches
 
✓ Backing up data
 
✓ Dealing with viruses
 
It’s a little early to put a figure on the benefits of moving the desktop into the 
data center, but anecdotal information suggests that this practice commonly 
reduces a PC’s annual total cost of ownership by approximately 40 percent to 
50 percent.
Session-based computing
In session-based computing, the user is really running a session on a server. 
The server is running a single instance of the Windows operating system with 
multiple sessions. Only the screen image is actually transmitted to the user, 
who may have a thin client or possibly an old PC. Products that provide this 
capability include Citrix MetaFrame and Microsoft Terminal Services.
Operating-system streaming
In this approach, the Windows OS software is passed to the client device — but 
only as much of the software that’s needed at any point in time. Technically, 
this process is called streaming. Thus, the Windows OS and its applications are 
split between the client and the server. You can implement this approach by 
using PCs on the desktop (diskless PCs and laptops are options) or by using 
thin clients. Both Citrix and Hewlett-Packard provide this capability.

165
 Chapter 13: Desktop and Device Management
True client virtualization
In true client virtualization, virtual PCs (complete emulations of a PC) are cre-
ated on the server. The user has what appears on the server to be a complete 
PC, but in reality, the PC is virtual. Use the desktop with either a laptop or a thin 
client. VMware and Citrix both provide software that delivers this capability.
 
From a service management perspective, you should understand that desktop 
virtualization doesn’t remove the need for management at the desktop. You 
still need to manage laptops and PCs that can’t be virtualized, and that task 
may still place a heavy demand on support.
The PC blade
 
A server blade is a server computer contained entirely on a single computer 
board that can be slotted into a blade cabinet — a purpose-built computer 
cabinet with a built-in power supply.
In this arrangement, a whole PC is sitting on a server blade in the data center, 
which isn’t shared in any way. Normally, the desktop is a thin client (refer to 
the sidebar “Thin is in,” earlier in this chapter).
Real versus virtual desktops
It’s easy to speak of PCs as though they’re all the 
same, but they’re not. In most organizations the 
80–20 rule holds: At least 80 percent of PC users 
can get by with the current standard model, and 
the rest have specialized needs, such as dual 
screens or highly configured devices.
This approximate 80–20 split affects any initia-
tive aimed at virtualizing the desktop, because 
you probably can’t virtualize all PCs. Therefore, 
you end up with two client management 
processes: one for virtualized desktops and one 
for real desktops.
The truth is that some PC users (so-called power 
users) really do need a whole PC, even if that 
PC runs only one application (such as Adobe 
Photoshop) that requires as much processing 
power as you can provide. Such applications run 
unacceptably slowly in virtualized environments. 
Typically, IT developers also need high-end PCs 
to run their development environments.

166
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Meeting Service Expectations 
in Client Environments
Specific service levels are undoubtedly an investment choice. The relation-
ship between extra investment and improved service levels is complex. It’s 
far less expensive to raise desktop PC availability levels from 97 percent to 
98 percent, for example, than to raise them from 98 to 99 percent. Sometimes, 
technology can make a difference for very little cost. A diskless PC, for exam-
ple, provides far greater availability than one with a disk and may be suitable 
for some users. Such inexpensive service improvement possibilities are rare, 
however. Disks are mechanical devices that wear out and, hence, have a 
relatively high failure rate. You can reduce that failure rate by consolidating 
storage into arrays of disks that are designed so that the failure of any disk 
causes no problems.
You can’t address end-to-end service-level issues in a simple manner; they’re 
caused by factors such as technology incompatibilities, software patches, 
and user error. With the right attention to the client, however, you can 
improve the service level of the client device. To increase service levels 
across the board, you need to address each issue and problem area individu-
ally, and then monitor your success levels.
Desktops in the cloud
A desktop in the cloud has nothing to do with 
your local meteorologist. In effect, it refers to 
the approach in which you don’t move the PCs 
into your data center; instead, you move them 
into the cloud. The process works this way:
 1. You virtualize your desktops wherever they 
are, replacing them with thin clients.
 2. The virtual PCs live in the cloud, which 
means that they live at one or more data 
centers run by service providers that house 
and support server hardware containing 
the virtual PCs.
All your software (administration/configuration 
and ownership) remains in your data center 
under your control, whether it’s desktop or client/
server applications. You deploy it into the cloud.
The business advantages are the same as in 
other forms of PC virtualization, reducing desk-
top ownership costs and support efforts in a 
big way. This approach also has some other 
advantages:
 ✓ The up-front investment is very low and 
transforms most client computing costs 
from fixed to variable (from capital to oper-
ating expense).
 ✓ It’s quick to deploy and easy to scale 
incrementally.
 ✓ It’s particularly attractive to companies that 
are running out of data center space.

167
 Chapter 13: Desktop and Device Management
User demand for improved service levels naturally increases over time 
because the amount of client-based (or usercentric) activity increases. 
Currently, voice over IP (VoIP) is fast becoming a desktop requirement, and 
video transmission may follow in its wake.
Following are two obvious key performance indicators for desktop management:
 
✓ Annual support costs per device: This metric is preferable to the total 
cost of ownership, which includes variable uncontrollable costs such as 
software licenses and device purchases.
 
✓ Availability: This metric, which measures uptime, gets close to 
100 percent with virtualized desktops.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the key elements of data management
▶ Knowing the various types of data
▶ Providing access to data
▶ Making data secure
▶ Preparing a disaster-recovery plan
P
erhaps your company delivers an online service to small businesses. It 
helps businesses track and manage their consultant workload, manag-
ing contracts, project proposals, project management, expense reporting, 
and so on. This information comes from multiple customers in multiple loca-
tions. Your servers store all the data. You also provide your clients industry 
information that you pull from multiple sources and tailor to your clients. 
Service-level agreements (SLAs) make sure that your customers can access 
this service 24/7 and that if the system does goes down, you’ll restore service 
in a certain amount of time.
One day, a customer reports that she can’t access her account. Then more 
customers call your service desk with the same complaint. You realize that 
all the servers have shut down because of a flood. You can’t restore the ser-
vice and recover the data because you didn’t back up the servers in the past 
month and didn’t have a secondary storage facility. Heads roll. Lawsuits are 
filed. Your company goes out of business.
This extreme example shows the importance of data management in meeting 
customer expectations.

170
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
In this chapter, we look at the key issues that need to be part of your data 
management strategy: data delivery, storage, and retrieval; backup and resto-
ration; disaster recovery; and archiving.
Creating a Data Management Strategy
Before you put together a data management strategy, you need to ask 
yourself these questions: “What is my valuable data? Is it finance, human 
resources, or sales data? What would the effect be if something happened to 
this data?” When you have a handle on how important various categories of 
data are, and on the risk associated with either not being able to access that 
data or losing that data, you can start to put together a data management 
strategy. The goal is to develop a strategy that minimizes the risk to your 
company. Ask yourself these basic questions when you’re putting your strat-
egy together:
 
✓ What categories should we put the data in?
 
✓ How quickly and how often do people need to access this data?
 
✓ What level of performance do we need to provide the people who use 
the data?
 
✓ Who needs to view, access, modify, and change the data?
 
✓ What continuity policies and procedures does the business have? In 
other words, what have we agreed to do in case of data loss or worse?
 
✓ What are the security requirements for accessing this data?
 
✓ How much capacity does the business need to store this data?
 
✓ What are the company’s retention policies (that is, how long do we need 
to keep the data)? Do outside compliance and regulatory factors dictate 
those policies?
 
✓ How and where do we want to back up and restore data? Which data do 
we want to back up and restore?
All these questions need to be answered in the context of the value of the 
data and how much your company can afford to spend on the strategy, which 
can be a tricky balancing act. Having a clear idea of the importance of the 
data your company uses can help you set your priorities, however.

171
 Chapter 14: Data Management in a Service Management World
Reviewing the Elements 
of Data Management
 
Data management is a critical component of any service management strategy. 
It has five key elements:
 
✓ Data delivery: Companies are dealing with ever-increasing amounts of 
data of all types, from structured to unstructured (see the following sec-
tion). You need a way to manage all this data. Your company, custom-
ers, and partners need this data, often in real time.
 
✓ Data storage and retrieval: Where are you going to store the data while 
customers are using it?
 
✓ Data backup and restoration: Along with storing the data, you have to 
make sure that you have a good backup and restoration plan. Then you 
have to make sure that the plan works!
 
✓ Disaster recovery: Disaster sometimes strikes. Make sure that you can 
get back any data you may have lost. Your company’s survival may 
depend on it.
 
✓ Data archiving: Often, corporate compliance or other mandates require 
you to store data off-site for an extended period (such as years) before 
destroying it.
 
Before jumping into discussing these critical components, we want to make 
one thing clear: Data integrity and security are critical. Before you can safely 
do anything with your data, make sure that the data’s integrity is beyond 
reproach and that data security measures are in place. Because the topic of 
security is so important, we devote Chapter 16 to it.
Typing your data for delivery
Data comes in many shapes and sizes, and a sound data management strat-
egy needs to deal with any kind of data that a business collects and uses, 
which may include these types:
 
✓ Structured data generally has a defined length and format. Examples 
include numbers, dates, and groups of words and numbers called strings 
(for a customer’s name, address, and so on). Structured data resides in a 
database or some other data store.

172
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Unstructured data doesn’t follow a specified format. It includes any-
thing from documents such as claims forms, expense reports, medical 
records, and presentations to Web content, images, and even streaming 
audio and video files.
 
✓ Semistructured data, such as an HTML document, has some structure 
but not enough to be called structured.
 
✓ E-mail: Don’t forget about e-mail! Sometimes, companies have desig-
nated proprietary file systems just to store e-mail.
The reality is that a lot of data floats around your company and needs to flow 
to your customers, partners, and anyone else who needs it and has permis-
sion to use it. Way back when, in the dawn of computing, this wasn’t the case. 
The monolithic mainframe typically contained data and software applications 
all in the same place. The software application called the data from the data-
base. Data was often stored on a tape that was loaded onto the mainframe 
when needed.
As times changed, files began to be transported over computing networks — 
not much data at first, because moving a lot of data through a network wasn’t 
affordable. Now companies can move massive amounts of data from one 
place to another over a network — in some companies, more than a terabyte 
of data a second!
In addition, some companies need to access data in real time, which might 
may be measured in milliseconds. A customer service representative who 
is speaking to a customer, for example, needs to get the customer’s records 
to address an issue. Also, a large trading system may be handling massive 
amounts of information at lightning speed.
Getting at data: Storage and retrieval
Data access is critical to getting the job done. The examples in the preced-
ing section illustrate just how critical it is to access the data that you’ve 
collected and created. But how are you going to store and get hold of this all-
important information?
Here are some data storage systems that serve this purpose:
 
✓ Database systems: Databases usually store structured records. Various 
models are available; the most popular is the relational database model 
(RDBM). In an RDBM, records are stored in tables (sometimes called 
relations). A customer table, for example, holds info such as customer 
ID, name, address, and age. Another table contains information about 

173
 Chapter 14: Data Management in a Service Management World
products purchased, as well as the customer ID. You can query (request 
information from) these two tables by using the customer ID as the 
common key.
 
✓ In-memory databases: Some companies need to deal with massive 
amounts of structured information, and they need to query that informa-
tion on the fly. In-memory databases, which are becoming popular, usu-
ally store structured records in a cache (such as in the computer’s CPU) 
for fast access.
 
✓ Enterprise content management systems: This type of system usually 
contains unstructured records: documents, faxes, call-center notes, 
claims, contracts, and other unstructured information that flows 
through the organization.
 
 The system stores and provides online access to these documents, 
thereby preventing document loss and unauthorized content access, 
and making document retrieval much easier. Some content management 
systems classify documents according to type and provide a search 
capability for easier document retrieval.
 
 A content management system can help an organization meet compli-
ance guidelines. Certain content may be held in the system for a certain 
period — five years, for example — and then archived (or perhaps 
destroyed) in accordance with corporate compliance policies.
 
✓ Web content-management systems: This type of system stores all the 
elements of a Web page, including text and digital images. The role of 
this system is to simplify the publication of content to a Web site.
 
✓ E-mail management systems: Some companies keep their e-mails cen-
trally stored in a proprietary e-mail management system.
 
✓ File servers: A file server is a networked computer that stores shared 
files.
 
Regardless of how you’re storing the data, you must negotiate the following 
issues with the client:
 
✓ Permission to access data: In many companies, only people with spe-
cific job functions can access certain types of data. A marketing person 
probably wouldn’t be able to access information related to manufactur-
ing parts, for example.
 
✓ Required performance levels: You need to establish the service levels 
demanded of these systems with regard to returning data. A business 
may require 200-millisecond response time around the clock, for 
example.

174
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Speed of data access and updating: Data consumers may have certain 
expectations about how quickly they can access data and how timely 
the data is. All these considerations need to be negotiated between IT 
and the business. Sometimes, data subscribers can’t get what they want 
because their requests are simply too expensive in terms of hardware 
costs.
 
✓ Retention period: A retention policy states how long the data should be 
held.
Securing data: Backup and recovery
 
Make sure that you have a backup copy of your data in case the data is lost, 
corrupted, or compromised.
Backup media
An enormous range of backup devices and media is available; each medium 
has pros and cons. For large-scale, enterprise backups, the following three 
types of media are most popular:
 
✓ Tape: Magnetic tape is one of the oldest backup media. Although it has 
a low cost per gigabyte of storage, the way that the data is written to 
the tape also means that retrieving data from the tape takes longer than 
with other media. If you need extremely fast response time from your 
backup, using tape would be difficult.
 
 Also, magnetic tape isn’t very durable. Think about your old VHS tapes, 
and you get the picture. We’re not saying that you shouldn’t use tape; 
many, many companies do because it’s cheap and because buying more 
tape for more backups is easy. With tape, though, you need to take extra 
care that you have the right processes in place to protect the media 
from getting ripped.
 
 Just so you don’t think that magnetic tape is your only choice, you can 
try other options, such as WORM (Write Once, Read Many) tape, using 
a combination of hardware and software to make the data stored on the 
tape nonwritable and nonerasable.
 
✓ Hard drive: These drives are sometimes referred to as fixed media. 
Often, a hard drive is simply connected to the server or workstation for 
backup. Optionally, hard drives are put together in an array, sometimes 
referred to as a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). You can 
configure a RAID setup in multiple ways that are beyond the scope of 
this book. Note, however, that retrieving data from a hard drive is easier 
than retrieving it from a tape.

175
 Chapter 14: Data Management in a Service Management World
 
✓ Optical disc: Some experts believe that optical discs are the most 
secure backup media because they’re hardier than fixed media and 
tapes. (Think about DVDs and CDs.) You burn your data directly onto 
the disc. Accessing information stored on an optical disc takes longer 
than acessing data on a hard drive, however.
 
When deciding what kind of backup media to use, consider capacity (how 
much data can be stored per unit), cost per gigabyte of storage, durability, 
portability, and regulatory compliance.
 
Alternatively, you can back up data at a backup service (and store backup 
data on the network). Backup services have become increasingly popular. The 
services are convenient, and you don’t have to buy or maintain any hardware 
or software yourself. But you need to do your homework to make sure that 
these services meet your needs in terms of scheduling backups, recovering 
information, ease of use, reliability, and so on.
Elements of a backup strategy
Not all data is created equal. Consider the following questions when devising 
a backup strategy:
 
✓ What is the company’s critical data? How often do we need to back it 
up? Does the company have the right physical security in place to pro-
tect this media?
 
✓ Do we have the right priorities in terms of data backup? In other words, 
have we considered whether we need to have a different backup plan 
for more critical data or for data that falls under various compliance 
regulations?
 
✓ What should the backup data do?
 
✓ Do we need to send the backup off-site for secure storage?
 
✓ How often do we need to retrieve the data, and how quickly can we 
retrieve it?
 
✓ Does the staff need training to use this media?
 
✓ Can we get the data back to our applications in the amount of time spec-
ified in the SLA?
 
✓ Have we tested the backup plan to make sure that it works?
 
Backup can be expensive. You don’t necessarily want to back up every piece 
of data every day and quickly fill your media. Sometimes, it makes sense to 
back up only what has changed. Determine what is optimal for your company 
based on service-level expectations.

176
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Preparing for the worst: 
Disaster management
Bad things happen to good companies, so every company needs a disaster-
recovery plan, which outlines what happens in case all (or part) of your 
system becomes unusable. The plan is a formal document that details the 
business-continuity effects of a disaster as well as the who, what, where, and 
when of addressing a disaster head-on, such as how long the company can 
afford for the system to be down and how the business will be affected.
Different companies have different strategies. Some have a complete facility 
ready to go if disaster strikes. Others prepare a cold facility, which has the 
equipment (such as computers) but isn’t yet up and running. Still other com-
panies simply back up their data and applications online — a method that 
takes more time.
 
Critical elements of a disaster-recovery plan include the following:
 
✓ Application inventory: Know what applications you’re running and all 
the data you’re using. If you don’t have this information, how can you 
plan to restore what’s necessary in priority order?
 
✓ Risk analysis and business-impact analysis: Any worthwhile plan 
includes a thorough analysis of how downtime will affect critical sys-
tems and data. Make sure that you also analyze any regulatory or com-
pliance mandates, including which systems you must return first. This 
analysis involves determining both the effects and the magnitude of 
those effects. If your call-center customer information is destroyed, for 
example, you need to determine the effect of this loss and the potential 
magnitude of its effect on your business.
 
 Risk analysis and business-impact analysis are disciplines in their own 
right. Standards bodies such the Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library (ITIL) reference various portals to help companies determine 
risk and impact and to develop business-continuity plans. For details on 
ITIL, see Chapter 5; for more information on ITIL and continuity manage-
ment, check out www.itil-itsm-world.com/itil-8.htm.
 
✓ Disaster-recovery teams: The plan may involve people from across the 
organization, including employees from IT (hardware, software, com-
munications, security, and facilities) and customer-facing staff members. 
Some team members are responsible for getting the hardware up and 
running when disaster strikes. Some are responsible for getting data 
back online. Some are responsible for communication — informing 
your customers, partners, and others about the situation and its status. 
Training may be an important part of the plan, so that everyone knows 
his or her role and exactly what to do in case of disaster.

177
 Chapter 14: Data Management in a Service Management World
 
✓ Operating procedures: You should establish what each person needs to 
do to get data up and running again.
 
✓ Testing and maintenance: Test the plan before you need it, and test it 
again on an ongoing basis to make sure that it still works.
 
Does your company already have well-articulated plans for data storage, 
retrieval, backup, and disaster management? If so, you probably feel that 
you’re in good shape, and we hope that you are — but even well-thought-out 
backup and recovery plans are worth very little if you have low-quality data. 
Place a high priority on ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of data at 
the outset of any data management plan.
Storing data long-term: Archiving
Archiving is the process of loading data into long-term storage before you 
consider destroying it. We’re talking about both digital data and paper docu-
ments here. Many companies still have to contend with archiving their paper-
based documents.
You need to archive your data for several reasons:
 
✓ Compliance: Government bodies have various regulations about how 
long a company needs to store certain types of information. In the 
United States, for example, publicly traded companies must comply with 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which stipulates that electronic data 
must be kept for three to seven years.
 
✓ Offloading of records: To lower the cost of storage, you may want to 
move your data from more expensive, highly reliable devices that can 
deliver data quickly to less expensive yet still reliable devices that allow 
you to get to the data if you need to.
 
✓ E-discovery: Sometimes, you need to locate specific information that 
you need in a court case or a legal dispute.
 
✓ Peace of mind: Although you may not think that you need all your data, 
you’ll be glad that you can find it when you need it.
 
Keeping inactive data on your active servers or workstations usually isn’t cost-
effective. Many companies transition this data to another system that may be 
less expensive to maintain. If you do the same thing, make sure that you don’t 
introduce errors into the process when you move the data. Also make sure 
that the new system can handle the load.
Some companies outsource archiving to a third party that specializes in stor-
ing data until the time comes to destroy it. Some of these organizations can 
index the data so that you can get to it if necessary.

Virtualizing the Computing 
Environment
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing how virtualization evolved
▶ Knowing how virtualization works
▶ Dealing with management issues
▶ Moving virtualization to the cloud
W
hy are we putting virtualization and cloud computing together in a 
discussion of service management?
Virtualization (using computer resources to imitate other computer 
resources or even whole computers) is one of the technical foundations of 
cloud computing (providing computing services via the Internet). We think 
that these two concepts are important to the data center and its destiny.
In this chapter, we present an overview of virtualization: what it means and 
how it is structured. We follow that discussion by explaining cloud comput-
ing. We also look at how the combination of virtualization and cloud comput-
ing is transforming the way services are managed.
Understanding Virtualization
Many companies have adopted virtualization as a way to gain efficiency and 
manageability in their data center environments. Virtualization has become a 
pragmatic way for organizations to shrink their server farms.

180
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Essentially, virtualization decouples the software from the hardware. 
Decoupling means that software is put in a separate container so that it’s iso-
lated from operating systems.
Virtualization comes in many forms, because one resource is emulating (imi-
tating) another resource. Here are some examples:
 
✓ Virtual memory: PCs have virtual memory, which is an area of the disk 
that’s used as though it were memory. In essence, the computer more 
efficiently manages virtual memory; it simply puts information that 
won’t be used for a while on disk, freeing memory space. Although disks 
are very slow in comparison with memory, the user may never notice 
the difference, especially if the system does a good job of managing vir-
tual memory. The substitution works surprisingly well.
 
✓ Software: Companies have built software that can emulate a whole 
computer. That way, one computer can work as though it were actually 
20 computers. If you have 1,000 computers and can reduce the number 
to 50, the gain is very significant. This reduction results in less money 
spent not only on computers, but also on power, air conditioning, main-
tenance, and floor space.
 
In a world in which almost everything is a service, virtualization is a funda-
mental mechanism for delivering services. Indeed, virtualization provides a 
platform for optimizing complex IT resources in a scalable manner (in a way 
that can grow efficiently), which is ideal for delivering services.
We can summarize the nature of virtualization with three terms:
 
✓ Partitioning: In virtualization, many applications and operating systems 
(OSes) are supported within a single physical system by partitioning 
(separating) the available resources.
 
✓ Isolation: Each virtual machine is isolated from its host physical system 
and other virtualized machines. One virtual-instance crash doesn’t affect 
the other virtual machines. Data isn’t shared between one virtual con-
tainer and another.
 
✓ Encapsulation: A virtual machine can be represented (and even stored) 
as a single file, so you can identify it easily based on the service it 
provides. In essence, the encapsulation process could be a business 
service. This encapsulated virtual machine can be presented to an appli-
cation as a complete entity. Therefore, encapsulation can protect each 
application so that it doesn’t interfere with another application.

181
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
A short history of virtualization
IBM introduced virtualization in the early 1960s 
to enable users to run more than one operat-
ing system on a mainframe. Mainframe virtu-
alization became less relevant to computing 
needs in the 1980s and 1990s. Indeed, in the 
1990s, companies stopped worrying about the 
efficiency of the computer platform because 
computers were getting so powerful.
For more than a decade, IT organizations 
expanded the capabilities of their data centers 
by adding more and more servers. Servers had 
become so cheap that each time a new appli-
cation was added, it was easier to buy a new 
server than to try to share resources with other 
applications. Eventually, organizations real-
ized that the chore of maintaining, upgrading, 
and managing a large and growing number of 
servers was getting out of hand. The number 
of support-staff employees required to oper-
ate the data center was climbing swiftly, so the 
manpower cost of maintaining the data center 
(as a percentage of the total cost) was rising. 
At the same time, other costs were growing in 
an unpredicted manner, particularly the costs 
of electricity (to power the computers), air con-
ditioning (to cool them), and floor space.
Scheduling a revolution
One of the main problems was that the servers 
that people had been happily adding to their 
networks were running horribly inefficiently. In 
the days of the mainframe, great efforts were 
made to use 100 percent of the computer’s CPU 
and memory resources. Even under normal cir-
cumstances, it was possible to achieve better 
than 95 percent utilization. On the cheap serv-
ers that IT departments had been deploying, 
however, CPU efficiency was often 6 percent or 
less — sometimes as low as 2 percent. Memory 
and disk input/output (I/O) usage were similarly 
low.
This situation seems almost insane until you 
realize that applications simply don’t require a 
great deal of resources, and with the servers 
that were being delivered by the time the year 
2000 rolled around, you didn’t put more than 
one application on a server. Why? Because 
the operating systems that everyone bought — 
Windows and Linux, mostly — didn’t include 
any capability to schedule the use of resources 
effectively between competing applications. 
In a competitive hardware market, vendors 
began increasing the power of servers at an 
affordable price. Most of these servers had 
more power than typical applications needed. 
The same inefficiencies of Windows and Linux 
didn’t address the efficiency problem, however. 
If an organization decided to stay with older 
but lower-powered hardware, it couldn’t find 
people to maintain those aging platforms.
So if you had an application that only ever 
needed 5 percent of a current CPU, what were 
you going to do other than provide it with its 
own server? Some companies actually used old 
PCs for some applications of this kind, maintain-
ing the PCs themselves, but there’s a limit to the 
amount of old equipment that you can reuse.
The solution to this squandering of resources 
was adding scheduling capability to comput-
ers, which is precisely what one IT vendor, 
VMware, introduced. Adding scheduling began 
to change the dynamics of computer optimiza-
tion and set the stage for the modern virtualiza-
tion revolution. The mainframe is dead; long live 
the mainframe!

Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Using a hypervisor in virtualization
If you’ve read about virtualization, you’ve bumped into the term hypervisor. 
You may have found this word to be a little scary. (We did when we first read 
it.) The concept isn’t technically complicated, however.
 
A hypervisor is an operating system, but more like the kind that runs on main-
frames than like Windows, for example. You need one if you’re going to create 
a virtual machine. One twist: The hypervisor can load an OS as though that OS 
were simply an application. In fact, the hypervisor can load many operating 
systems that way.
 
You should understand the nature of the hypervisor. It’s designed like a 
mainframe OS because it schedules the amount of access that these guest 
OSes have to the CPU; to memory; to disk I/O; and, in fact, to any other I/O 
mechanisms. You can set up the hypervisor to split the physical computer’s 
resources. Resources can be split 50–50 or 80–20 between two guest OSes, for 
example.
The beauty of this arrangement is that the hypervisor does all the heavy lift-
ing. The guest OS doesn’t have any idea that it’s running in a virtual partition; 
it thinks that it has a computer all to itself.
 
Hypervisors come in several types:
 
✓ Native hypervisors, which sit directly on the hardware platform
 
✓ Embedded hypervisors, which are integrated into a processor on a 
separate chip
 
✓ Hosted hypervisors, which run as a distinct software layer above both 
the hardware and the OS
Abstracting hardware assets
One of the benefits of virtualization is the way that it abstracts hardware 
assets, in essence allowing a single piece of hardware to be used for multiple 
tasks.
The following list summarizes hardware abstraction and its management:
 
✓ File system virtualization: Virtual machines can access different file sys-
tems and storage resources via a common interface.

183
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
 
✓ Virtual symmetric multiprocessing: A single virtual machine can use 
multiple physical processors simultaneously and thus pretend to be a 
server cluster. It also can emulate a fairly large grid of physical servers.
 
✓ Virtual high availability support: If a virtual machine fails, that virtual 
machine needs to restart on another server automatically.
 
✓ Distributed resource scheduler: You could think of the scheduler as 
being the super-hypervisor that manages all the other hypervisors. 
This mechanism assigns and balances computing capability dynami-
cally across a collection of hardware resources that support the virtual 
machines. Therefore, a process can be moved to a different resource 
when it becomes available.
 
✓ Virtual infrastructure client console: This console provides an interface 
that allows administrators to connect remotely to virtual center manage-
ment servers or to an individual hypervisor so that the server and the 
hypervisor can be managed manually.
Managing Virtualization
To manage virtualization, you must keep track of where everything is, what 
everything has to accomplish, and for what purpose. You must also do the 
following things:
 
✓ Know and understand the relationships among all elements of the 
network.
 
✓ Be able to change things dynamically when elements within this 
universe change.
 
✓ Keep the placement of virtual resources in step with all the other infor-
mation held in the configuration management database (CMDB). Given 
that few organizations have anything approaching a comprehensive 
CMDB, that’s asking for a lot. In fact, the CMDB needs to know how all 
service management capabilities are integrated. (For more information 
on the CMDB, see Chapter 9.)
Foundational issues
Managing a virtual environment involves some foundational issues that deter-
mine how well the components function as a system. These issues include 
how licenses are managed, how workloads are controlled, and how the net-
work itself is managed. The reality is that IT sits between the network’s static 

184
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
virtualization and the dream of full automation. We discuss some founda-
tional issues in the following sections.
License management
 
Many license agreements tie license fees to physical servers rather than vir-
tual servers. Resolve these licenses before using the associated software in a 
virtual environment. The constraints of such licenses may become an obstacle 
to efficiency.
Service levels
Measuring, managing, and maintaining service levels can become more com-
plicated simply because the environment itself is more complex.
Network management
The real target of network management becomes the virtual network, which 
may be harder to manage than the physical network.
Workload administration
Set policies to determine how new resources can be provisioned, and under 
what circumstances. Before a new resource can be introduced, it needs to 
be approved by management. Also, the administrator has to be sure that the 
right security policies are included.
Capacity planning
Although it’s convenient to think that all servers deliver roughly the same 
capacity, they don’t. With virtualization, you have more control of hardware 
purchases and can plan network resources accordingly.
IT process workflow
In virtualization, the workflow among different support groups in the data 
center changes; adjust procedures gradually.
Abstraction layer
Managing virtualization requires an abstraction layer that hides and manages 
things between the physical storage subsystems. The virtualization software 
needs to be able to present the whole storage resource to the virtualized 
environment as a unified, sharable resource. That process can be more dif-
ficult than it sounds. All the administrative functions that you’d need in a 

185
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
physical data center have to be deployed in a virtualized environment, for 
example. Following are some of the most important considerations:
 
✓ You have to factor in backup, recovery, and disaster recovery. 
Virtualized storage can be used to reinforce or replace existing backup 
and recovery capabilities. It can also create mirrored systems (duplicates 
of all system components) and, thus, might participate in disaster-
recovery plans.
 
✓ You can back up whole virtual machines or collections of virtual 
machines in any given state as disk files. This technique is particularly 
useful in a virtualized environment after you change applications or 
complete configurations. You must test — and, therefore, simulate — 
this configuration before putting it in a production environment.
 
✓ You must manage the service levels of the applications running in a vir-
tualized environment. The actual information delay from disk varies for 
data held locally, data held on a storage area network (SAN), and data 
held on network access storage (NAS), and the delay differences may 
matter. Test different storage options against service levels.
 
 For more information on SANs, see Storage Area Networks For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Christopher Poelker and Alex Nikitin (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 
✓ In the long run, establish capacity planning to support the likely growth 
of the resource requirement for any application (or virtual machine).
Provisioning software
Provisioning software enables the manual adjustment of the virtualized envi-
ronment. Using provisioning software, you can create new virtual machines 
and modify existing ones to add or reduce resources. This type of provision-
ing is essential to managing workloads and to moving applications and ser-
vices from one physical environment to another.
Provisioning software enables management to prioritize actions based on a 
company’s key performance indicators. It enables the following:
 
✓ Migration of running virtual machines from one physical server to 
another
 
✓ Automatic restart of a failed virtual machine on a separate physical 
server
 
✓ Clustering of virtual machines across different physical servers

186
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
Managing data center resources is hard under any circumstance — and even 
harder when those resources are running in virtual partitions. These managed 
resources need to provide the right level of performance, accountability, and 
predictability to users, suppliers, and customers. Virtualization must be man-
aged carefully.
Virtualizing storage
Increasingly, organizations also need to virtualize storage. This trend cur-
rently works in favor of NASes rather than SANs, because a NAS is less expen-
sive and more flexible than a SAN.
 
Because the virtualized environment has at least the same requirements as 
the traditional data center in terms of the actual amount of data stored, man-
aging virtualized storage becomes very important.
In addition to application data, virtual machine images need to be stored. 
When virtual machines aren’t in use, they’re stored as disk files that can be 
instantiated at a moment’s notice. Consequently, you need a way to store 
virtual-machine images centrally.
Hardware provisioning
Before virtualization, hardware provisioning was simply a matter of commis-
sioning new hardware and configuring it to run new applications or possibly 
repurposing hardware to run some new application.
Virtualization makes this process a little simpler in one way: You don’t have 
to link the setup of new hardware to the instantiation of a new application. 
Now you can add a server to the pool and enable it to run virtual machines. 
Thereafter, those virtual machines are ready as they’re needed. When you 
add a new application, you simply configure it to run on a virtual machine.
 
Provisioning is now the act of allocating a virtual machine to a specific server 
from a central console. Be aware of a catch, however: You can run into trouble 
if you go too far. You may decide to virtualize entire sets of applications and 
virtualize the servers that those applications are running on, for example. 
Although you may get some optimization, you also create too many silos 
that are too hard to manage. (For more information on silos, see the nearby 
sidebar “Static versus dynamic virtualization.”) You may have optimized your 
environment so much that you have no room to accommodate peak loads.

187
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
The hypervisor (refer to “Using a hypervisor in virtualization,” earlier in this 
chapter) lets a physical server run many virtual machines at the same time. 
In a sense, one server does the work of maybe ten. That arrangement is a 
neat one, but you may not be able to shift those kinds of workloads without 
consequences. A server running 20 virtual machines, for example, may still 
have the same network connection with the same traffic limitation, which 
could act as a bottleneck. Alternatively, if all those applications use local 
disks, many of them may need to use a SAN or NAS — and that requirement 
may have performance implications.
Security issues
 
Using virtual machines complicates IT security in a big way. Virtualization 
changes the definition of what a server is, so security is no longer trying to 
protect a physical server or collection of servers that an application runs on. 
Instead, it’s protecting virtual machines or collections of virtual machines. 
Because most data centers support only static virtualization, it isn’t yet well 
Static versus dynamic virtualization
Virtualization actually is even more complicated. 
There are two types of virtualization: static and 
dynamic. Static virtualization is difficult, but the 
dynamic type is even more so.
In static virtualization, application silos become 
virtualized application silos. (A silo is an iso-
lated piece of software and hardware that 
doesn’t have the ability to interact with other 
components; it’s a world unto itself.) You use 
virtualization to reduce the number of servers, 
but the virtualization is done via a fixed pattern 
that ensures that applications always have suf-
ficient resources to manage peak workloads. 
This arrangement makes life relatively simple 
because that virtual machine will stay on the 
same server. Static virtualization is signifi-
cantly more efficient than no virtualization, but it 
doesn’t make optimal use of server resources.
If you want to optimize your environment, you 
need to be able to allocate server resources 
dynamically, based on changing needs within 
the business. Dynamic virtualization is complex, 
however. It’s so complex that the market cur-
rently doesn’t offer products that can imple-
ment it effectively. But those products will be 
available in time, because the virtualization cat 
is out of the bag.
Why is dynamic virtualization inevitable? The 
workloads in the data center are dynamic, 
especially considering that Internet applica-
tions change their transaction rates wildly over 
time. As the key performance requirements of 
the environment change, the virtual environ-
ment must change to meet those needs. In the 
long run, envision a world in which the whole 
network is treated as though it were a single 
resource space that can be shared dynamically 
based on changing workloads.

188
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
understood what will happen during dynamic virtualization. Definite issues 
have been identified, however, and we address several of them in the follow-
ing sections.
Network monitoring
Current network defenses are based on physical networks. In the virtualized 
environment, the network is no longer physical; its configuration can actually 
change dynamically, which makes network monitoring difficult. To fix this 
problem, you must have software products that can monitor virtual networks 
and, ultimately, dynamic virtual networks.
Hypervisors
 
Just as an OS attack is possible, a hacker can take control of a hypervisor. 
If the hacker gains control of the hypervisor, he gains control of everything 
that it controls; therefore, he could do a lot of damage. (For more details, see 
“Using a hypervisor in virtualization,” earlier in this chapter.)
Configuration and change management
The simple act of changing configurations or patching the software on virtual 
machines becomes much more complex if the software involved is locked 
away in virtual images, because in the virtual world, you no longer have a 
fixed static address to update the configuration.
Perimeter security
Providing perimeter security such as firewalls in a virtual environment is a 
little more complicated than in a normal network, because some virtual serv-
ers are outside a firewall.
 
This problem may not be too hard to solve, because you can isolate the vir-
tual resource spaces. This approach places a constraint on how provisioning 
is carried out, however.
Taking Virtualization into the Cloud
Virtualization, as a technique for achieving efficiency in the data center and 
on the desktop, is here to stay. As we indicate earlier in this chapter, virtual-
ization is rapidly becoming a requirement for managing a data center from a 
service-delivery perspective. Despite the economies that virtualization pro-
vides, however, companies are seeking even better economies when they’re 
available.

189
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
In particular, companies have increasing interest in cloud computing (see the 
following section), prompted by the assumption that cloud-computing pro-
viders may achieve more effective economies of scale than can be achieved 
in the data center. In some contexts, this assumption is correct.
If you like, you can think of cloud computing as being the next stage of devel-
opment for virtualization. The problem for the data center is that workloads 
are very mixed; the data center needs to execute internal transactional 
systems, Web transactional systems, messaging systems such as e-mail and 
chat, business intelligence systems, document management systems, work-
flow systems, and so on. With cloud computing, you can pick your spot and 
focus on getting efficiency from a predictable workload.
From this somewhat manual approach, you can move to industrial virtual-
ization by making it a repeatable platform. This move requires forethought, 
however. What would such a platform need?
 
For this use of resources to be effective, you must implement a full-service 
management platform so that resources are safe from all forms of risk. As in 
traditional systems, the virtualized environment must be protected:
 
✓ The virtualized services offered must be secure.
 
✓ The virtualized services must be backed up and recovered as though 
they’re physical systems.
 
✓ These resources need to have workload management, workflow, provi-
sioning, and load balancing at the foundation to support the required 
type of customer experience.
Without this level of oversight, virtualization won’t deliver the cost savings 
that it promises.
Defining cloud computing
Based on this background, we define cloud computing as a computing model that 
makes IT resources such as servers, storage, middleware, and business applica-
tions available as a service to business organizations in a self-service manner. 
Although all these terms are important, the important one is self-service.
 
In a self-service model, organizations look at their IT infrastructure not as 
a collection of technologies needed for a specific project, but as a single 
resource space. The difference between the cloud and the traditional data 
center is that the cloud is inherently flexible. To work in the real world, the 
cloud needs three things:

190
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Virtualization: The resources that will be available in a self-service 
model no longer have the same kinds of constraints that they face in the 
corporate environment.
 
✓ Automation: Automation means that the service is supported by an 
underlying platform that allows resources to be changed, moved, and 
managed without human intervention.
 
✓ Standardization: Standardization is also key. Standardized processes 
and interfaces are required behind the scenes. Interoperability is an 
essential ingredient of the cloud environment.
When you bring these elements together, you have something very powerful.
What type of cloud services will customers subscribe to? All the services 
that we describe as the foundation of virtualization (refer to “Understanding 
Virtualization,” earlier in this chapter) are the same ones that you’d make 
available as part of the cloud. You want to be able to access CPU cycles, stor-
age, networks, and applications, for example, or you may want to augment 
the physical environment with additional CPU cycles during a peak load. 
Alternatively, you may want to replace an entire data center with a virtual-
ized data center that’s based on a virtualized environment managed by a 
third-party company.
Cloud computing is in its very early stages. In fact, in many situations cus-
tomers aren’t even aware that they’re using a cloud. Anyone who uses 
Google’s Gmail service, for example, is leveraging a cloud, because Google’s 
own search environment runs within its own cloud. In other situations, large 
corporations are experimenting with cloud computing as a potential way to 
transfer data center operations to a more flexible model.
Another example is Amazon.com, which sells access to CPU cycles and stor-
age as a service of its cloud infrastructure. A customer may decide to use 
Amazon’s cloud to test a brand-new application before purchasing it, because 
renting is easier than owning.
In cloud environments, customers add CPU cycles or storage as their needs 
grow. They’re protected from the details, but this protection doesn’t happen 
by magic. The provider has to do a lot of work behind the scenes to manage 
this highly dynamic environment.
Using the cloud as utility computing
For decades, thinkers have talked about the day when we would move to 
utility computing as a normal model of managing computing resources. 

191
 Chapter 15: Virtualizing the Computing Environment
Computing power would be no different from electricity. When you need 
some extra light in a room, for example, you turn on the light switch, and 
the electric utility allocates more power to your house. You don’t have an 
electrical grid in your home, and you don’t have to acquire tools to tune the 
way that power is allocated to different rooms of your home. Like electrical 
power, computing power would be a highly managed utility.
Obviously, we’re far from that scenario right now. The typical enterprise 
is filled with truly heterogeneous data centers, assorted servers, desktops, 
mobile devices, storage, networks, applications, and vast arrays of manage-
ment infrastructures and tools. In fact, you may have been told that about 
85 percent of these computing resources are underused.
In addition, at least 70 percent of the budget spent on IT keeps the current 
systems operational rather than focusing on customer service. The advent 
of cloud computing is changing all that. Organizations need to reduce risk; 
reduce costs; and improve overall service to their customers, suppliers, and 
partners. Most of all, they need to focus on the service levels of the primary 
transactions that define the business.
 
IT organizations that decide to proceed with business as usual are putting 
their companies at risk. Also, because most IT budgets aren’t growing, meet-
ing customer expectations and performance goals without violating the 
budget is imperative. In truth, the biggest problem that IT organizations have 
isn’t just running data centers and the associated software, but managing the 
environment so that it meets the required level of service.
Veiling virtualization technology 
from the end user
Any vendor that wants to provide cloud services to its customers has a lot to 
live up to. All the virtualization technology that supports these requirements 
is hidden from the customer. Although the customer may expect to run a 
wide variety of software services on the cloud, she may have little, if any, 
input into the underlying services.
Cloud customers see only the interface to the resources. In this self-service 
mode, they have the freedom to expand and contract their services at will. 
Vendors providing cloud services have to provide a sophisticated service-
level agreement (SLA) layer between the business and the IT organization. 
The vendors have a responsibility to provide management services, including 
a service desk to handle problems and real-time visibility of usage metrics 

192
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
and expenditures. For two reasons, it’s the vendor’s responsibility to provide 
a completely reliable level of customer service:
 
✓ The customer has the freedom to move to another vendor’s cloud if he 
isn’t satisfied with the level of service.
 
✓ Customers are using the cloud as a substitute for a data center; there-
fore, the cloud provider has a responsibility to both internal and exter-
nal customers.
Overseeing and managing a cloud environment are complicated jobs. The 
provider of the cloud service must have all the management capabilities that 
are used in any virtualized environment. In addition, the provider must be 
able to monitor current use and anticipate how it may change. Therefore, the 
cloud environment needs to be able to provide new resources to a customer 
in real time. Also, a high level of management must be built into the platform. 
Much of that management needs to be autonomic — self-managing and 
self-correcting.
 
Any sophisticated customer leveraging a cloud will want an SLA with the 
cloud provider. That customer also needs a mechanism to ensure that service 
levels are being met (via a full set of service management capabilities).

S
ecurity is a fundamental requirement if you’re implementing true service 
management. You may think that someone else in your organization is 
responsible for security. Think again. Don’t leave security to an independent 
department somewhere in the bowels of IT. This chapter shows you how, 
overall, security has to be baked into service management.
Unless you’re fresh out of college, you know that before 1995, IT security 
wasn’t a significant problem, so very little money was spent on it. By 2004, 
organizations around the world were spending more than $20 billion on IT 
security, and that figure is expected to rise to $79 billion by the end of 2010. 
What happened?
Our guess is that you already know what happened. The Internet happened, 
letting computers connect remotely to hundreds of millions of other comput-
ers and giving lots of bad guys ample opportunity to launch a new career. 
The bad guys got better at breaking into IT networks, so the cost of stopping 
them escalated.

194
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
IT security is a very awkward area of service management for three reasons:
 
✓ Almost all applications are built without any consideration for security.
 
✓ IT security delivers very few benefits beyond reducing the risk of secu-
rity breaches.
 
✓ Measuring the success of any IT security investment is very difficult.
Before describing any IT security products or processes, we expand on these 
points.
Understanding the Universe 
of Security Risks
When software developers design a system, they don’t incorporate security 
features that might keep that system and its data more secure.
Historically, developers didn’t need to add security features, because com-
puter operating systems had a built-in security perimeter based on login 
identity and permissions (rules specifying what programs users could run and 
what data files users could access). With the advent of networks, however, an 
operating system could be artificially extended to work across a network.
 
PCs had no security at all initially, but a password-and-permissions system 
was added for networkwide security based on login. In IT security circles, this 
system is called perimeter security because it establishes a secure perimeter 
around the network, the applications it runs, and the data stored within. Many 
of the security products that organizations deploy, such as firewalls and vir-
tual private networks (VPNs, which are encrypted communication lines), are 
also perimeter-security products. They improve the security of the perimeter, 
which is a bit like plugging holes in the castle walls.
Currently, the IT industry faces a problem: Security approaches (including 
perimeter security) are becoming less effective. To understand why, you 
must know how security threats arise.
Inside and outside threats
About 70 percent of security breaches are caused by insiders (or by people 
getting help from insiders). This statistic is based on surveys of organiza-
tions that suffer breaches, but the truth is that no one is sure exactly what 

195
 Chapter 16: IT Security and Service Management
the figure is. Insiders rarely get caught, and proving insider involvement usu-
ally is impossible when a security attack comes from a computer outside the 
organization.
 
Nevertheless, the possibility that insiders will open a door for hackers or 
mount an inside attack makes it clear that perimeter security on its own will 
never be enough.
 
The outside threat is best described this way:
 
✓ Hackers can be very talented engineers. They use specially designed, 
very sophisticated software tools to gain access and subvert systems.
 
✓ Hackers can have networks of thousands of compromised PCs under 
their control. Such networks, called botnets, are extremely powerful.
 
✓ Hackers may have channels through which they can sell an organiza-
tion’s data. A whole economic ecosystem has been built around the sale 
of stolen data.
 
✓ Some hackers have financial channels through which they can extort 
money with impunity.
 
✓ Hackers are guns for hire and may be hired by your competitors to per-
form industrial sabotage.
In summary, both inside and outside threats are real and may be formidable. 
How do you protect against them?
Types of attacks on IT assets
The type of protection you need depends on what you’re trying to prevent. 
Here’s a list of bad things that can happen:
 
✓ Denial-of-service (DOS) attack: Drowning some external connection 
service (such as a Web server) in an avalanche of traffic, thereby pre-
venting the service from working. Normally, the aim is to extort money 
(“We’ll stop when you pay us”) or to damage the service out of sheer 
delinquency.
 
✓ Resource theft: Stealing computer equipment, particularly laptops.
 
✓ Firewall breach: Breaking through a firewall to access servers on the 
corporate network directly. Not all firewalls work perfectly, and those 
that do can be misconfigured.

196
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
✓ Virus infection: Implanting a virus on some computer in the network to 
open a back door into the network. Many such viruses can be planted in 
many ways.
 
✓ Software mischief: Using password-cracking software or known security 
weaknesses in some software (any kind accessed via the Internet) to 
gain access to the network.
 
✓ Social engineering: Persuading an inside user to reveal his password.
 
 Hackers sometimes call users, pretending to be the service desk, and 
trick them into revealing their passwords.
 
✓ Data theft: Stealing any data that commands commercial value, such as 
financial details on customers, commercial secrets, or financial results.
 
✓ Data destruction: Destroying or corrupting data in an attack.
 
✓ Resource hijacking: Taking control of some of an organization’s comput-
ers to run malevolent software, such as a program that sends out spam.
 
✓ Fraud: Interfering with legitimate business applications to perpetrate a 
fraud, such as causing money to be sent to fraudulent accounts or redi-
recting ordered goods to temporary pickup addresses.
You can’t block all attacks — and when we say that, we mean it. If you ana-
lyze the last four items in the preceding list, you quickly see that no simple 
solution can address these threats. A hacker can mount a successful attack 
in many ways, and unless you have an unlimited security budget, you can’t 
block all those efforts completely.
 
You can reduce the risk of a successful attack, however. Here are a few 
methods:
 
✓ Anti-DOS technology: Neutralize DOS attacks (which are purely external 
threats) by investing in appropriate technology. You can use different 
products — both software and hardware based — depending on the 
kind of attack you’re trying to protect against.
 
✓ Physical and personal security: Guard against resource theft by adding 
physical security in the office and employing personal vigilance outside 
the office.
 
✓ Firewall maintenance: Apply the right level of diligence to maintaining 
firewalls.
 
✓ White-listing: Stop all viruses by white-listing: telling the system exactly 
what software is allowed to run on any server in the network and block-
ing all other software. (For more information, see “HIPS and NIPS,” later 
in this chapter.)
 
✓ Automatic login termination: Reduce the risk of password cracking by 
automatically terminating login attempts after a certain number of tries.

Taking a Structured Approach 
to IT Security
Most people in IT security know that the best they can do for any computer 
network is significantly reduce the risk of a successful attack. Therefore, IT 
security is an exercise in risk management.
In general, follow these steps to reduce the risk of suffering security 
breaches:
 
1. Authenticate all people accessing the network.
 
2. Frame all access permissions so that any given user has access only to 
the applications and data that she’s been granted specific permission 
to access.
 
3. Authenticate all software running on any computer — and all changes 
to such software.
 
 You need to automate and authenticate software patches and configura-
tion changes, as well as manage security patches in a proactive way.
 
4. Formalize the process of requesting permission to access data or 
applications.
 
5. Monitor all network activity, and log all unusual activity.
 
 In most cases, you should deploy intruder-detection technology.
 
6. Log all user activity and program activity, and analyze it for unex-
pected behavior.
 
7. Encrypt, up to the point of use, all valuable data that needs extra 
protection.
 
8. Regularly check the network for vulnerabilities in all software 
exposed to the Internet or external users in any way.
If you read these steps and don’t think that they’ll be too hard to carry out, 
you don’t know how complex it is to implement all these rules across a large 
network. Very few networks come close to this level of protection.
The reality of IT security is that point solutions usually are put in place to 
cover specific vulnerabilities. Thus, companies use firewalls to protect the 
internal network from the Internet, antivirus software to protect individual 
computers against known viruses, and VPNs to protect external connections 
coming into the network. Such security products reduce the risk of specific 
threats but don’t constitute an integrated approach to IT security. Right now, 

198
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
that approach doesn’t exist outside the realm of government organizations 
such as the National Security Agency, and it may not exist inside such organi-
zations, either.
But some important products can make a significant contribution to building 
an integrated IT security platform. They come in three categories:
 
✓ Identity management
 
✓ Detection and forensics
 
✓ Data encryption
We discuss these products separately in the following sections.
Implementing Identity Management
We discuss identity management systems in conjunction with the configura-
tion management database in Chapter 18, focusing on the way systems cap-
ture data for use by other service management applications. The role of an 
identity management system is much wider, of course.
 
Identity management’s primary goal is managing personal identity information 
so that access to computer resources, applications, data, and services is con-
trolled properly. Identity management is the one area of IT security that offers 
genuine benefits beyond reducing the risk of security breaches.
Benefits of identity management
The benefits of identity management come in three flavors:
 
✓ Improved security: Such security improvements clearly have some 
financial value by virtue of the security breaches they prevent, but 
attaching a meaningful figure to that value is difficult.
 
✓ Directly reduced costs: Direct cost reductions come from the following 
benefits:
 
• Improved user productivity: Productivity improvement results 
from simplification of the sign-on interface (see “Single sign-on,” 
later in this chapter) and the ability to get access rights changed 
quickly. Productivity is likely to improve further where you pro-
vide user self-service.

199
 Chapter 16: IT Security and Service Management
 
• Improved customer and partner service: This benefit is the same 
as the simplified procedures described in the preceding para-
graph, but delivered to partners and customers.
 
• Reduced help desk costs: Reductions in help desk costs usually 
contribute significantly to overall cost reduction, mostly because 
IT doesn’t have to field so many calls about forgotten passwords.
 
• Reduced IT costs: Identity management enables automatic provi-
sioning — providing or revoking users’ access rights to systems 
and applications. Provisioning happens whether you automate 
it or not. When provisioning is manual, normally it’s carried out 
by members of the IT operational staff or departmental staff. 
Considerable time and cost savings are possible when you auto-
mate the process (see “Provisioning,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Compliance: If your company must meet IT security compliance, iden-
tity management will inevitably help in that area.
Aspects of identity management
In this section, we cover the various aspects of an identity management 
program.
Data collation and management
Identity data generally is scattered around systems. Establish a common 
database or directory as a first step in gaining control of this information. 
This step involves inputting data and gathering data from various user 
directories.
Integration
An identity management system must integrate effectively with other appli-
cations to exchange identity information. In particular, it must have a direct 
interface to the human resources system — the place where new joiners and 
leavers are first recorded. It also must have a direct interface with supply-
chain systems (if partners and suppliers are to use corporate systems) and 
customer databases (if customers require access to some systems), although 
customer identity management normally is handled by a separate component 
of an identity management system.
Stronger authentication
When you require authentication stronger than passwords, the identity man-
agement system must work with products that provide that authentication, 

200
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
such as biometric systems (fingerprints, handprints, iris verification, and the 
like) and identity token systems.
Provisioning
When you link all systems that use identity information, you can automate 
provisioning. If this process is automated, a single status change (of an 
employee or anyone else with access rights) can be defined in the identity 
management system and sent across all affected systems from that point.
Implementing a new application or changes in department business pro-
cesses may affect the access requirements of individual users or user roles. 
Provisioning cuts across departments, possibly involving human resources, 
IT, and other departments.
 
When the process is automated, errors in providing users a broader level of 
access than necessary occur far less frequently or not at all. Providing broad 
levels of access happens frequently in manual provisioning, because it’s easier 
to specify broad access than to specify a much more detailed granular level 
of access. Additionally, an automated process never fails to revoke former 
employees’ access to the network.
When provisioning is complex, perhaps requiring approvals by several 
people in different departments, it requires a workflow arrangement. Ideally, 
you base the provisioning process on user self-service backed by a well-
thought-out approval process.
Single sign-on
Single sign-on means providing all users an interface that validates identity 
as soon as a user signs on anywhere; this interface requires the user to enter 
a single password. Thereafter, all systems should know the user and her 
permissions.
 
Some single-sign-on products don’t provide the full gamut of identity manage-
ment capabilities, but all identity management products deliver single-sign-on 
capability.
Rather than being assigned to individuals, permissions are often assigned to 
roles (accounts clerk, sales assistant, programmer, and so on). Therefore, 
single sign-on also means capturing information about the administration 
hierarchy. Single sign-on naturally goes with portal technology, with the user 
having a Web-based initial interface that provides access to all applications 
that he’s entitled to access. Thus, single sign-on may need to interface with a 
portal product.

201
 Chapter 16: IT Security and Service Management
Security administration
Another benefit that identity management confers is a reduction in security 
administration costs. Security administrators no longer have to make manual 
authorization grants in dozens of systems; the identity management system 
handles that workflow automatically. This arrangement is particularly useful 
for organizations that have distributed security administration over several 
locations, because it enables security administration to be centralized.
Data analysis
After you centralize all user data, you can generate useful reports on 
resource and application use or carry out security audits. If you’re having 
problems with internal hacking, for example, you can check a log that lists 
every user’s activity (see the following section). Also, if you have logging 
software for databases and files, you can monitor who did what to any item 
of data and when, including who looked at specific items of data. This audit 
capability is important for implementing data privacy and data protection 
compliance.
Employing Detection and Forensics
In this section, we discuss three specific groups of IT security products:
 
✓ Activity logs
 
✓ Host-based intrusion protection systems and network-based intrusion 
protection systems
 
✓ Data audit
 
No one — intruder or legitimate user — should be able to use those resources 
without leaving evidence. You want to detect any illegitimate activity as soon 
as it happens, but in many situations, you can separate the legitimate from 
the illegitimate. If you don’t detect an attack while it’s happening, at least you 
have a record of what took place.
Activity logs
Many logging capabilities are included in operating systems, applications, 
databases, and devices such as hardware firewalls and network monitors. 
A cost is associated with invoking logging capabilities: Turning on logging 
requires the system to write log records constantly, and it also involves cre-
ating a process to manage and archive such data until it’s no longer needed.

202
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Log files often provide some evidence of how fraud was perpetrated, how-
ever. Perpetrators of digital fraud often escape justice simply because the 
victim doesn’t have sufficient evidence to prove what they did.
HIPS and NIPS
Host-based intrusion protection systems (HIPS) and network-based intrusion 
protection systems (NIPS) are the same thing: a collection of capabilities that 
make it difficult for intruders to penetrate a network. These systems can 
include the following elements:
 
✓ System and log-file monitors: This software looks for traces of hackers 
in log files. The monitors can watch login accounts, for example, and 
issue alerts when account permissions change — often an indication 
that something untoward is going on.
 
✓ Network intrusion-detection systems (NIDS): These security programs 
monitor the packets of information that travel through a computer net-
work, looking for any telltale signs of hacker activity. The effectiveness 
of a NIDS depends on its capability to sort real dangers from harmless 
threats and legitimate activity. An ineffective NIDS raises too many false 
alarms and, thus, wastes time.
 
✓ Digital deception software: This software deliberately misleads anyone 
who’s attempting to attack the IT network. It can range from the simple 
spoofing of various service names to setting up traps known as honey-
pots or honeynets. (For more information, see the nearby sidebar 
“Fooling attackers by spoofing.”)
 
 Setting traps is unusual and can be expensive. It’s normally done by gov-
ernment sites or by companies that suspect digital industrial espionage.
 
✓ White-listing software: This software inventories valid executable pro-
grams running on a computer and prevents any other executables from 
running. White-listing severely hampers hackers, because even if they 
get access to a computer, they can’t upload their own software to run on 
it. White-listing software reports on any attempt to run unauthenticated 
software. It also stops virus software stone dead.
 
✓ Unified threat management: This central function takes information 
from all the preceding components and identifies threats by analyzing 
the combined information.

203
 Chapter 16: IT Security and Service Management
Data audit
Although databases log who changed any data, they normally don’t log who 
read any piece of data. But read data is easily stolen. Enthusiasm for filling 
this gap increased considerably after the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation was 
enacted in 2002, specifically demanding that financial data be secured from 
unauthorized eyes. Consequently, a series of software products that log who 
looks at what quickly came into existence. These products generally are 
referred to as data audit products.
Encrypting Data
The IT world has a whole set of encryption techniques that can be regarded 
as completely safe. Thus, you can easily encrypt data and ensure that only 
the intended recipient can decrypt it.
You could encrypt everything. You could encrypt data when you write it 
to disc, when you send it down a wire, when you send it through the air by 
radio, and so on. Encrypting everything in a comprehensive way consider-
ably reduces your exposure to data theft. Hackers wouldn’t be able to cover 
their tracks, because they’d never be able to decrypt the log files.
Fooling attackers by spoofing
As a technical IT term, spoofing means pretend-
ing to be something else. In a so-called phishing 
attack, a false Web site pretends to be a genu-
ine one. A phishing Web site might pretend to 
be a bank’s Web site, for example, and try to 
tempt users to reveal their financial details. It’s 
possible to spoof e-mail addresses and, under 
some circumstances, Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses, but mounting an attack this way is 
difficult because a computer responds directly 
to the real address rather than to the spoofed 
address.
When you use spoofing as a defense, your aim is 
to confuse attacking software. Hackers employ 
sniffing software to look for servers running 
specific versions of, say, Microsoft Windows. 
If you set the operating system to give out false 
information, which is easy enough to do, that 
false information confuses the attacking soft-
ware into passing on by.
Honeypots work by spoofing, too. They pre-
tend to be vulnerable servers and thereby 
trick attackers into revealing details on where 
they’re attacking from.

204
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
Encryption poses a performance penalty, however, so focus encryption on 
specific data that needs protection.
Think about how you use encryption. A fairly recent case of data theft 
included data that was encrypted until it was delivered to the application 
that needed to use it. At that point, the data was decrypted for use — and 
that’s exactly where the hacker struck. The loss could have been prevented 
if the application itself had controlled the decryption on a record-by-record 
basis.
Because of the complexities it adds, encryption is used less frequently than 
perhaps it should be. The media have covered many cases of stolen laptops 
containing valuable data — including military secrets. Those thefts wouldn’t 
have been problems if all the data on those laptops had been encrypted 
properly.
Creating an IT Security Strategy
This book isn’t IT Security For Dummies, so we won’t go into creating a 
comprehensive IT security strategy. We do want to provide some pointers, 
though:
 
✓ In most circumstances, IT security needs to be approached from a risk 
management perspective. If your organization has risk management spe-
cialists, involve them in IT security planning.
 
✓ IT security monitoring has no simple key performance indicators, but 
be aware of what similar organizations spend on IT security. That way, 
you have some awareness of the level of investment. Similarly, it makes 
sense to keep track of time lost due to any kind of attack — a useful mea-
surement of cost that you may be able to reduce over time.
 
✓ You need identity management for many reasons, and identity manage-
ment offers many benefits. Give priority to improving identity manage-
ment if your current capability is poor.
 
✓ Try to create general awareness of IT security risks by educating and 
warning staff members about specific dangers (such as social engineer-
ing; refer to “Types of attacks on IT assets,” earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ Regularly have external IT security consultants check your company’s IT 
security policy and IT network.
 
✓ Determine specific IT security policies for change management and 
patch management, and make sure that policies are well understood by 
your service management staff.

205
 Chapter 16: IT Security and Service Management
 
✓ Stay abreast of news about IT security breaches in other companies and 
the causes of those breaches.
 
✓ Review backup and disaster-recovery systems in light of IT security. 
Apart from anything else, IT security breaches can require complete 
application recovery.
When a security breach occurs on a specific computer, the applications run-
ning on that computer will likely have to be stopped. Consequently, security 
breaches can be the direct causes of service interruptions and can contribute 
to lower service levels. Also, data theft resulting from a security breach could 
result in a real or perceived breach of customers’ trust in your organization.
All you can do right now, however, is reduce the risk of such occurrences. 
Current IT security technology doesn’t allow for integration and, hence, a 
higher level of maturity.

Chapter 17
Business Service Management
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding business service management
▶ Managing risk with key performance indicators
▶ Setting business and IT service levels
▶ Balancing business goals
A
lot of business, technological, and organizational issues have to come 
together in proper service management. How can service management 
goals provide important benefits to your company’s business goals? The 
reality is that companies are at different stages of implementing a service 
management strategy. But no matter where your company is, the fundamen-
tal premise is that service management is an integral part of your business 
strategy.
Why did we wait until now to discuss business service management? You 
first have to understand the parts of service management and how they work 
together; otherwise, you don’t know what tools are at your disposal. Here’s 
a way to think about this issue: Imagine that you’re in your car starting out 
on a trip. You don’t have a map, and you haven’t decided where you want 
to go. You stop at the nearest gas station and ask for directions. But how 
can you possibly figure out which path is best if you don’t even know which 
town you’re going to? As the old saying goes, if you don’t know where you’re 
headed, any road will do.
In this chapter, we explain what business service management is and how a 
business can benefit from it.

208
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Defining Business Service Management
 
Business service management (BSM) is an approach to bringing together the 
following to provide management a holistic view of the business:
 
✓ Business process
 
✓ Business services
 
✓ IT service levels
BSM provides a way to measure and monitor the whole so that management 
can have comprehensive and meaningful oversight. How is this approach dif-
ferent from traditional approaches to managing IT? BSM is actually a super-
set. Yes, you have to manage your data center, the sensors in equipment on 
your factory floor, the desktops across your company . . . we could go on for 
quite a while. But would that be enough? Clearly, the answer is no. All these 
tasks focus on making sure that part of the infrastructure is operational. The 
reality is that BSM takes all these facets of managing the parts and brings 
them together based on the company’s goals.
Based on this definition, it should be clear that BSM isn’t a product.
Every corporation, no matter what its size, operates based on business goals 
and rules that dictate how the business functions. What is the company’s 
mission? Who are the stakeholders? What do the shareholders expect? After 
an organization analyzes these factors, it measures progress toward these 
goals.
Using Key Performance Indicators 
in Risk Management
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable measurements, agreed to 
by the business, that reflect the critical success factors of an organization. 
If a company wants to be the most profitable in its industry, its KPIs are 
based on measuring profit and the prices of good and services. Contrast this 
example with a company that sells a sophisticated product to a small set of 
demanding customers. Its KPIs are related to product quality and customer 
satisfaction.
 
The more technology a company uses to achieve its business goals, the more 
of its KPIs focus on its IT infrastructure. A company such as Google or Netflix, 

209
 Chapter 17: Business Service Management
for example, has a lot of KPIs related to the effectiveness and efficiency of its 
data centers.
To be meaningful, KPIs have to be measurable. Suppose that your company 
has a KPI related to the response time for your online customer portal. 
The KPI states that a customer should expect a 1-second response time. 
Suddenly, response time has changed to 1.7 seconds. You must drill down to 
see how significant this problem may be. Is the response-time degradation 
related to an increase in business? What would the cost to the company be 
if this level of service continues? What would the cost to the company be 
if it wants to get back to the 1-second response time? Putting this situation 
in context with overall corporate goals, you may decide that 1.7 seconds is 
actually all right because the level of risk is minimal.
 
You always must understand KPIs in the context of risk to the business 
overall.
The 1.7-second response time may not affect the overall success of your 
business, but other factors may be much more important. If 1.7 percent of all 
customer data is lost or compromised, for example, would that be a problem 
for the business? After all, 1.7 percent is a small percentage of your overall 
customers. The company may not be willing to live with this level of risk, 
however.
KPIs are a balancing act between a company’s goals and its ability to achieve 
business objectives while minimizing risk. When the corporate board sets the 
agenda for how the company will behave and achieve its goals, a framework 
exists for approaching BSM. These objectives can’t be achieved in a vacuum.
Putting Service Levels in Context
When you have a good understanding of your company’s goals (and the level 
of risk it’s willing to take), start thinking about the service levels you need to 
manage.
This process is trickier than it may sound. Your boss may say, “I want the 
best service the industry can provide! Nothing is too good to support my 
customers!” Who wouldn’t want the best? The level of business service that 
your company can provide its customers and stakeholders, however, is con-
ditional. Unlike our scenario of perfection (see the sidebar “The best-case 
scenario: Perfection,” at the end of the chapter), most companies are con-
strained by costs. Deciding on strategic goals and objectives puts a company 
in a position to understand what it needs to do to achieve the right service 
levels for the business.

210
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Business service levels
 
A business service level is a line of defense that you must apply to the circum-
stances that make a difference in meeting the company’s goals. How important 
is the quality of service to the way the business operates? What is the impact 
of good quality on the profitability of the company? A business service level 
can have these types of ramifications in delivering profitability to the company.
Consider whether you need 100 percent uptime from your e-mail system, 
for example. Employees want e-mail to work all the time, obviously, but if 
e-mail is down for 20 minutes a day, will it affect the bottom line, make the 
company less competitive in the market, or reduce customer satisfaction 
by 10 percent? Probably not. Why is this an issue? Promising 100 percent or 
even 99.999 percent uptime for the e-mail system requires a lot of technology: 
specialized software, redundant servers, and so on. In reality, though, occa-
sional e-mail downtime won’t necessarily bring the company to its knees.
When will something make a difference in the business? Consider security. Is 
it okay to have a data security breach for 20 minutes a day? No one would do 
business with a company that’s likely to lose private information.
The bottom line is that a business service level is a business decision. IT 
shouldn’t strive to achieve better service levels than it promised based on 
the goals of the company.
You may have noticed that we focus on the business service levels that relate 
to IT services — for good reason. Some business service levels relate to how 
personnel treat customers on the phone or to how a company ships supplies 
and the like. These tasks are people-related tasks that can affect the overall 
management of end-to-end processes. If a task that requires approval sits in a 
manager’s inbox for a week, dire consequences may result, affecting the man-
ager’s overall ability to direct the business. In reality, however, little synergy 
exists between these types of business service levels and IT.
 
The real benefit to the business comes from business service levels in which 
IT and business meet. Companies that sell technology-based products are 
more likely to have more business service levels that are controlled and 
affected by technology. If you took a peek under the covers at companies like 
Google, Amazon.com, and Netflix, you’d see a great deal of attention paid to 
business service levels.
IT service levels
After the business decides what’s important and how much service it needs 
to keep customers happy for the right price, IT takes control. Providing the 

211
 Chapter 17: Business Service Management
right level of service is the responsibility of the IT department, along with 
data center management.
 
These service levels are codified in service-level agreements (SLAs) between 
the business and the IT organization. The content of this agreement is based 
on meeting a set of expectations between the provider of a service and the 
consumer of the service. If you promise to provide e-mail to employees, for 
example, a set of rules governs how this contract will be executed.
That contract might read something like this:
 
1. We promise that 99.999 percent of the time, e-mail will be operational. If 
it does fail, we promise to fix it within 20 minutes.
 
2. We will monitor the performance of the e-mail system on a continual 
basis and will report the results to the business on a monthly basis.
This agreement may look very simple and straightforward — and it is. The IT 
organization has the infrastructure to meet this requirement. It has the tools 
to monitor the system on an ongoing basis. The business has determined 
that if the e-mail system fails on occasion, people may be annoyed, but the 
company will not suffer financially.
Other service levels are more complicated and have more consequences for 
a business. Often, companies have relationships with third-party IT service 
providers. An insurance broker, for example, might use a third-party service 
provider to pay claims on policies. In this case, the parties would establish 
a much more detailed SLA than our example SLA for internal e-mail service. 
The SLA might require the service provider to promise 100 percent security 
of its customer data, and it might require the company to guarantee payment 
within 24 hours of receipt of an invoice.
What happens if IT is not able to meet the level of service required by the 
business? Clearly, it’s the overall responsibility of the chief information offi-
cer to ensure that SLAs are met. Depending on the specific SLA, the CIO’s 
job may be at risk if the SLAs are not achieved. In some situations, failure to 
achieve a specific SLA can cause the company to lose significant business.
The more demands the company places on the service provider, the higher 
the cost. The company purchasing the service needs to decide how much 
risk it’s willing to accept. If the IT service provider doesn’t meet the provi-
sions of the SLA, it incurs penalties based on the severity of the problem. For 
this contract to work, both parties — the provider of the service and the con-
sumer of the service — need to be able to monitor the results.

212
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
The best-case scenario: Perfection
What would your company look like if it 
achieved BSM perfection? Let us tell you the 
story of ABC Fashion Giant. ABC has been in 
business for more than 100 years, providing 
low-cost copies of high-fashion clothing to 
discount stores across North America and 
Europe. As soon as a celebrity wears an outfit, 
its designers copy, manufacture, and distribute 
the clothing to customers.
The company’s KPIs (refer to “Using Key 
Performance Indicators in Risk Management,” 
earlier in this chapter) are to provide its cus-
tomers sufficient-quality garments that emulate 
the most popular designs. Speed and efficiency 
are the keys to the company’s success. ABC 
has maximized its profits by producing the right 
fashions for the lowest cost. Because it also 
must get the products delivered to customers 
as quickly as possible, its distribution network 
must be highly optimized. The company needs 
to have excellent data about costs, quality, and 
results of past efforts. It depends on an efficient 
data center to collect information from its facto-
ries, its distributors of raw materials, its supply 
chain, and its customer management system. To 
support this effort, the company has a detailed 
business process design that’s managed by a 
center of excellence made up of professionals 
from all areas of the business.
Our perfect company has its act together. It 
has established a well-designed business 
dashboard that includes all information about 
inventory levels, quality metrics, and customer 
satisfaction. These indicators are compared 
with those of previous years, as well as with 
competitors’ results. The dashboard reflects 
the KPIs set by the board. It also keeps track of 
business rules, governance metrics, and data 
center functions.
ABC’s data center was designed based on the 
strategy of the business. It has optimized perfor-
mance based on the business. Therefore, sys-
tems that support product sales to distributors 
and large store chains have redundant servers 
and mirrored sites in other cities. Key data is 
updated in real time. The management software 
is sophisticated enough to anticipate when 
a problem is starting to affect performance 
and, therefore, can provide new services on 
demand. Nothing is left to chance.
The IT management team uses sophisticated 
project management, so all changes to the data 
center and business processes are handled 
through a project portfolio management system. 
In addition, all data about services that are man-
aged within the data center is stored in a ser-
vice catalog (see Chapter 10), which includes all 
the rules governing the use and maintenance of 
services, its security, and characteristics. The 
catalog maintains and updates the status of the 
relationship between the services and the KPIs 
agreed on by the business and IT.
The company also understands the importance 
of securing the data about its manufacturing 
processes as well as customer data. Security 
(see Chapter 16) is a companywide initiative. 
Therefore, ABC hired a chief security officer 
who implemented a well-integrated security 
platform that is monitored in real time.
ABC Fashion Giant is the envy of its industry. 
Even when a hurricane caused a three-day 
power outage, ABC kept its operations up and 
running.

 Chapter 17: Business Service Management
Seeing Business Service Management 
As a Balancing Act
Successful BSM requires taking a holistic view of the business. You must 
measure and monitor everything as it relates to everything else. If you don’t 
take this holistic approach, you’ll be doing the business a disservice.
 
Everything in your organization is a service. A service is simply a way of deliv-
ering value to a customer or stakeholder by facilitating expected business 
results.
The nearby sidebar “The best-case scenario: Perfection” describes an ideal 
example of BSM. The truth of the matter, though, is that you won’t find a 
perfect solution to the struggle between satisfying all the desires of the busi-
ness for service and the financial constraints on the IT organization. Also, 
although you may recognize elements of your own company in the sidebar, 
you won’t find any such thing as a perfect company. Most companies are at 
different stages in their journey.

Chapter 18
Planning the Evolution 
of the Data Center
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out Google’s approach
▶ Planning corporate and data center strategy
▶ Creating a road map for the data center
T
he data center is at the heart of the computing environment. Anyone 
working there knows that a data center is dynamic, changing and matur-
ing as business requirements evolve and as technology emerges. This chap-
ter helps you plan for changes in the data center.
Data center management has two aspects, both of which are critical for ser-
vice management success:
 
✓ Day-to-day management includes operational and support issues such 
as configuration, release, and provisioning. (See Chapter 9 for more 
details.)
 
✓ Long-term evolution incorporates all the changes that companies need 
to support long-term strategic plans.
At the heart of these components is the requirement that project portfolio 
management (PPM) play a pivotal role in managing the evolution of the data 
center. PPM is a process intended to help your organization acquire and view 
information about its projects according to their importance. PPM focuses 
on important aspects of projects, including issues such as cost, value to 
company goals, and impact on resources. Management must understand the 
value of the collection of assets.

216
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
In the case of the data center, management must understand
 
✓ How the combined assets are managed
 
✓ How they benefit the business today
 
✓ How they must change to meet future requirements
In this chapter, we discuss the primary areas of data center planning. In 
doing so, we focus primarily on what can be thought of as evolutionary 
change. IT changes so rapidly that you have to plan not only for changes in 
business requirements, but also for future changes in the technology that 
you deploy.
Approaching Service Management 
the Google Way
Companies and IT departments are under a great deal of pressure to improve 
the efficiency of their data centers. The reason may well be related to the 
publicly acknowledged efficiency and effectiveness of Google. In a mere 
decade, Google has become a hugely profitable organization, running the 
largest computer network in the world with hundreds of thousands of serv-
ers. Its data centers (for it has quite a few) are the envy of many chief infor-
mation officers. These centers are efficient in terms of hardware use, power 
use, software architecture, and even location.
Google serves as an excellent example of the IT side of service management 
because for Google, the whole customer experience is IT. Even with the com-
pany’s vast resources, customer satisfaction comes down to a single overrid-
ing issue: speed. Therefore, response time is the driver of Google’s success. 
We humans are so impatient that we won’t tolerate even short delays; if 
response time stretches out beyond 140–200 milliseconds, we’re likely to take 
our business elsewhere. That’s how it is in the search business.
Over its short history, Google’s search latency has gone down from a whole 
second (1,000 milliseconds) to 200 milliseconds. Also, the company put the 
complete search index to the whole Web in computer memory shared across 
1,000 machines that divide the query work. Every time you send Google a 
query, 1,000 computers jump into action.

217
 Chapter 18: Planning the Evolution of the Data Center
Corporate and IT Strategizing, 
and Data Center Planning
Before you decide that your data center strategy should mimic Google’s, you 
need to understand the context of that company’s strategy. Google’s IT strat-
egy is fairly simple, because about three quarters of the company’s revenue 
comes from advertising associated with its search service. It isn’t a stretch to 
state that dominance in search is the pillar of Google’s corporate strategy. In 
fact, you could boil down its IT service management strategy to the ability to 
provide the fastest, most accurate search capability in the industry. In effect, 
Google IT service management focuses on a single Web page. Like any other 
company, Google also has to manage its own security, compliance, and people.
Many business leaders look at Google’s efficiency and effectiveness and want 
their own data centers to be equally well managed. Most companies have 
many more aspects to their business, however — and, therefore, to their 
service management strategy. If your company is a bank, insurance company, 
hospital, manufacturing concern, or retailer, providing the best possible ser-
vice can have many dimensions and can involve a wide variety of activities 
in a multitude of contexts. Therefore, your IT strategy can be very complex 
because it likely involves many different systems.
Figure 18-1 shows the activities involved in data center planning, with a focus 
on both the operational and the evolutionary. Chapters 8 and 9 discuss many 
operational issues; in this chapter, we focus on planning for the long term.

Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
The figure indicates the following:
 
✓ There is (or should be) a direct connection from corporate strategy 
through IT strategy to data center planning.
 
✓ The executive board determines corporate strategy and, ideally, 
explains it well enough so the whole company understands its goals.
As a consequence, IT strategy can be created with some sense, and the com-
pany’s efforts and investments can be focused correctly. It’s nice to imag-
ine a world in which corporate strategy and IT strategy are defined in fine 
detail, well documented, and published, but we don’t live in such a world. 
Nevertheless, efficiently run data centers exist because their goals have been 
set out and data center planning has been done in the light of those goals.
 
Change is the most important unifying theme of data center evolution. 
Because the data center is the manifestation of managing the services that 
define the business, you must make changes after a lot of thought. Therefore, 
planning is at the heart of data center evolution. When you look at the data 
center from a planning perspective, consider four areas of activities:
 
✓ Project portfolio management
 
✓ Technology evaluation
 
✓ Governance and compliance
 
✓ Business service management
We discuss these areas in detail in the following sections.
Project portfolio management
We devote most of this section to managing the data center by using a PPM 
approach. The biggest challenge facing IT is planning well and preparing for 
the unexpected.
When data center managers figure out how to finesse the planning, they can 
do two things: run an efficient operation and save money. But they don’t have 
a wand that they can wave to achieve these goals, which require careful plan-
ning and the use of organizational skills.
 
We think that using a PPM approach goes a long way to meeting the goal of 
balancing IT with business needs (see Chapter 17). Good PPM helps you become 
proactive but isn’t a project management system. Rather, it’s a technique 
and set of best practices for planning and managing data center components. 

219
 Chapter 18: Planning the Evolution of the Data Center
Often, these best practices are built into PPM software. Examples of this soft-
ware include CA Clarity PPM, Compuware Changepoint, Hewlett-Packard’s HP 
PPM, Planview Enterprise PPM, and Serena Mariner.
Putting PPM in context
In some ways, PPM is the opposite of the old-fashioned fire-drill approach to 
IT. Rather than thinking of a software upgrade, a new application, or a new 
server as a task, you think of the combination as a business project. A project 
might be virtualizing the server population as a way of optimizing power in 
the data center, and checking overall identity management to secure current 
and future business initiatives.
 
In fact, enhancing any element of service management should automatically 
initiate a process of understanding the following:
 
✓ The current process
 
✓ The way data has been managed
 
✓ How other processes have been managed
 
This process isn’t just an exercise. You simply can’t make significant changes 
in your data center without managing the dependencies that will be affected.
Figure 18-1, earlier in this chapter, shows a set of user requests as inputs to PPM. 
We aren’t talking about a plan for maintenance. Managing user requests in the 
context of PPM has a significant implication in planning for future capacity.
Managing change
Taking a PPM approach enables IT to consider the impact of data center 
changes on the business as a whole. New compliance requirements may 
lead to new software that manages those requirements, for example. The 
company may plan to add new online services, which will increase stress on 
existing servers and networks, and planned new partnerships will result in a 
different workload in the data center.
Typically, when large business initiatives occur, two types of IT projects 
occur: a software development project, and a data center delivery and imple-
mentation project. The data center portion can be a subproject of a larger 
effort, whereas initiatives to improve the data center may be projects in their 
own right.
 
Although anticipating future data center workload is never easy, a project ori-
entation helps management plan better. Aside from efficiently managing data 
center evolution, PPM helps IT keep the data center from exceeding capacity 
or at least predicting accurately when capacity will be exceeded.

220
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
 
Planning isn’t just for new applications and projects. Existing data center ele-
ments, such as the service desk, also are affected as the business changes. 
Also, you have limits on what you can achieve in any given data center. 
These limits may include floor space, power supply, personnel, development 
resources, or financing.
Coordinating downstream activities
Figure 18-2 depicts the activity that occurs downstream from PPM.

Three major activities occur downstream:
 
✓ Capacity planning: This activity used to be relatively simple; when 
adding a new application, the company added new hardware. Adding 
capacity is more complex with the introduction of virtualization (see 
Chapter 15) because then IT is managed as a resource pool. Capacity 
planning involves workload modeling, the activity of statistically model-
ing the load on the resources available for groups of applications. The 
goal is to predict the resource needs of the whole network over time, 
allowing for factors such as variations in application and network traffic.
 
✓ Infrastructure projects: As IT moves away toward a more integrated 
infrastructure, it also must move toward a more integrated set of service 
management processes and technology. Consequently, infrastructure 
projects such as establishing a federated configuration management 
database (CMDB; see Chapter 9) or virtualizing desktop computers 
are almost certain to involve changes in IT processes, which in turn 
may mean using processes that involve workflow and are based on 

221
 Chapter 18: Planning the Evolution of the Data Center
Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) definitions and 
models. (For more information on ITIL, see Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Systems development: Service oriented architecture (SOA) means both 
new applications and major changes to business processes. Because 
SOA makes application components available for use by other applica-
tions, it naturally creates new dependencies among applications or 
causes changes in existing dependencies. So when components are 
linked to build new applications or even to build end-to-end processes, 
existing software configurations are changed. This situation creates 
a testing issue, because now these components have to be tested to 
ensure that they work in all new contexts.
 
 As a general rule, SOA increases the dependencies among applications 
and application components, and the effect needs to be modeled and 
tested. The same end-to-end modeling needs to be used in capacity plan-
ning for the resources needed to support the SOA services. (See Chapter 6 
for more information on SOA.)
Technology evaluation
A data center can’t handle change without a well-thought-out process. In 
most cases, data center management can’t afford to adopt new technology 
until it’s been proved. The alternative is to go through the expense of proving 
it yourself. But even if the new technology works well within its own context, 
you still have the problem of integrating it. After a technology is widely used, 
the integration problem diminishes and maybe even vanishes. Standards are 
established for its use that other technologies naturally adopt.
 
You may find it tempting to be the first on the block to purchase new, 
unproven technology — but doing so is risky. New technology is disruptive, 
and its success is uncertain, no matter how compelling the marketing story is.
Evaluating technology doesn’t focus just on examining what new technolo-
gies can do; it also means considering when adopting those technologies 
makes sense. Unproven technology may be worth the risk if the pros (a major 
business advantage) dwarf the cons (usually, data center disruption and 
increased manual support costs). Such technology is rare for most data cen-
ters and businesses.
If you think about the data center as a type of factory, you see that change 
has to be well controlled. So if the company decides to adopt a new technol-
ogy for, say, data storage, that technology must be tested exhaustively and 
then implemented gradually and in a strictly monitored fashion.

222
Part IV: Nitty-Gritty Service Management 
Governance and compliance
Governance and compliance rules impose a whole set of constraints on 
data center evolution. (Chapter 10 provides a lot of detail on governance.) 
Whether they’re imposed by an industry or a government, rules dictate how 
personnel — support and operational staff — operate in the data center. 
Also, to some degree everything that’s done in an organization is carried out 
according to governance and compliance.
Business service management
 
Business service management, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 17, 
makes sure that changes in the data center are in line with business goals.
Accurately defining service levels is an obvious requirement. When any 
significant change is made in data center processes, the rest of the business 
is likely to experience changes in service levels. In most cases, the changes 
are positive and improve business service levels. If a data center doesn’t 
know the service levels it’s supposed to achieve and is unable to measure 
them, however, IT may underinvest; consequently, data center operations 
may improve while business service levels are degraded. Alternatively, 
IT may overinvest, increasing data center costs and resources more than 
necessary.
Most organizations currently have undefined or vague service levels. 
Typically, service levels for the data center’s mission-critical systems are 
known and, possibly, well defined. If a system fails, IT is in a difficult situation 
when responding to user complaints. A service level of 99.5 percent availabil-
ity sounds impressive, for example, but it still means that users can expect 
system unavailability for a whole day over the course of a year. This result 
may be unacceptable for some systems, such as e-mail, but it may be fine if 
e-mail is never unavailable for more than 15 minutes at a time.
 
Some organizations also experience the phenomenon of service-level creep. 
Again, e-mail provides a good example. Employees depend on e-mail so much 
that even a 15-minute outage may affect the way that they do their jobs. If 
you don’t review e-mail service levels regularly, IT doesn’t find out that user 
expectations have changed until an outage occurs — which is the wrong time 
to discover a change in service demand.
If everyone agrees that the service level wasn’t in the right spot and improv-
ing it will cost a significant amount of money, you can pretty much guarantee 
that the cost hasn’t been budgeted. That situation is the opposite of plan-
ning; it’s being caught unprepared. The data center planning cycle should 
naturally involve a review of service levels.

223
 Chapter 18: Planning the Evolution of the Data Center
Drawing an Evolutionary Road 
Map for the Data Center
Focus on the following when you’re planning data center evolution:
 
✓ The service desk: The service desk is the starting point for the resolu-
tion of service complaints. It constitutes the real-time response to service 
problems that software can’t solve. If you audit a data center in terms of 
its capabilities, start by examining its fault-resolution process. (For more 
information about the service desk, we recommend reading Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Configuration management database: We don’t believe that building a 
central CMDB (see Chapter 9) is worthwhile. We think that a federated 
data solution is inevitable. You should focus on collecting the fundamen-
tal data that ought to reside in a CMDB, however, which means focusing 
early on the following:
 
• Configuration management
 
• Identity management
 
• IT asset management and asset discovery
 
✓ Project portfolio management: If you skillfully carry out PPM, it 
becomes the driving mechanism for data center evolution. It lets you 
start planning the future so that the data center aligns itself to support 
business services directly.
 
A limited amount of change is possible in any given time frame. Every com-
pany starts from a different point, and to a great degree, its priorities are 
determined by the business.
Start Developing Your 
Service Strategy Now!
We hope that we’ve given you a taste of some of the important issues and 
approaches that make the service management journey so exciting. There’s 
certainly a lot to think about.
 
We leave you with this thought: Service management is a businesscentric 
view. It starts with developing a service strategy based on internal and exter-
nal market factors. The goal is to meet customer expectations. When you 
develop the services strategy, you’re ready to develop your service manage-
ment plan; the two go hand in hand. Good luck!

Chapter 19
Manufacturing
In This Chapter
▶ Elbit Systems of America
▶ Cisco
▶ Varian Medical Systems
I
n this chapter we look at the service management challenges of three 
companies — Elbit Systems of America, Cisco, and Varian Medical 
Systems — that manufacture highly complex and technologically advanced 
products and systems. These three very different companies have similar 
needs for servicing customers (internal and external) with the high level of 
attention that very technical products demand. All operate in industries such 
as health care and defense, which are highly regulated and secured.
What does this mean in terms of a service management strategy? All three com-
panies invest substantial resources in research and development. Think of all 
the engineers and scientists working in technical environments that require 
the support of a complex technology infrastructure! In addition, globally based 
sales teams and technical consultants numbering in the thousands need con-
sistent access to information about products, customers, and partners.
Securing facilities and data is a requirement for these manufacturing com-
panies. They need to ensure compliance with the security demands of 
government and military customers and with industry regulations such as 
the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Elbit 
Systems of America makes and supports many products used by the U.S. 
military to advance the security of the United States. Consultants do a lot 
of work at secure client sites, and Elbit Systems of America’s own facilities, 
data, and applications need to meet similar security requirements. One of 
Elbit Systems of America’s top service-management priorities was to more 
efficiently provide employees appropriate, secure access to facilities, applica-
tions, and data.

228
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
Cisco and Varian Medical Systems also have customers in the highly secure 
defense and security industries; however, their service-management efforts 
had a slightly different focus from Elbit Systems of America’s. The goal of 
Cisco’s service management program is to transform IT into a services busi-
ness to enable Cisco’s corporate strategy. Varian Medical Systems wanted to 
create a more efficient, timely response to service customers.
Elbit Systems of America
The five distinct business units of Elbit Systems of America — a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Elbit Systems, based in Israel — provide complex, 
high-performance technology to the defense, security, aviation, and medi-
cal instrumentation industries. Just to give you an idea, Elbit Systems of 
America’s products and services include dismountable computer platforms 
for military vehicles, laser systems for military helicopters, and maintenance 
and logistics support of military electronic equipment.
Harry Butler, IT project manager for Elbit Systems of America, is responsible 
for making sure that all company employees get the IT services and support 
they need to get their jobs done. This mission may sound simple, but with 
thousands of employees involved, many of whom work at the high-security 
sites of client sites, it gets very complicated.
In 2001, Butler knew his team needed to take a new approach to service 
management to deliver consistently high-quality services to internal custom-
ers. IT needed a more holistic, proactive approach to managing services. As 
Butler put it, “It dawned on us that we could put out fires for the rest of our 
lives or actually go try to figure out what was causing the problems and why 
customers were upset.” The company hired an outside consulting firm to 
assess the company’s approach and make recommendations. The company 
established a service desk to deal with incident and problem management; 
then it implemented plans for a service catalog and a configuration manage-
ment database (CMDB). Virtualization was a key part of the strategy. The IT 
team at Elbit Systems of America found out a lot along the way.
Implementing a service desk
The first order of business was deploying a service desk solution with a good 
incident-management system. IT initially targeted its internal customers — 
consultants and solution providers who need consistent access to secure 
information and IT services. What problems did the service desk need to 
handle? Generally, if an Elbit Systems of America employee can’t access the 

229
 Chapter 19: Manufacturing
applications he needs, he contacts the service desk with an urgent request. 
Suppose that a vice president of contracts needs to complete a proposal while 
he is onsite with a major client but can’t access Elbit Systems of America’s 
computers over the company’s virtual private network (VPN). He must 
receive immediate assistance from the service desk if he wants to close the 
deal. At the same time, the service desk receives less-urgent calls. Before the 
service desk solution was implemented at Elbit Systems of America, however, 
IT gave all calls the same level of priority.
An important step in implementing the service desk was negotiating and agree-
ing on service levels with end users. Butler recognized that the old way — 
treating all calls as top priority — wasn’t working. The company needed to 
balance available resources against the priorities of the business. The only 
way to do this effectively was for the business to articulate its needs and for 
IT to identify the cost tradeoffs. According to Butler, this negotiation process 
is ongoing, but IT has gotten good at it.
Streamlining business processes
After getting the service desk up to speed, Butler and his service manage-
ment team had more time to devote to streamlining their approach to han-
dling service requests. The intention was to automate some manual aspects 
of approving requests, such as authorizing file-share access.
With the help of senior executives, Butler’s team reviewed the process for 
one of the most common service desk requests: permission to access secure 
facilities, files, or applications. This process involved many manual steps, 
ranging from users filling out paper forms to locating the person authorized 
to grant access rights. Sometimes a paper form was misplaced on its journey, 
and the company lost several days just trying to get employees access to 
facilities or applications. Other common requests, such as ordering a com-
puter, also benefited from in-depth analysis.
Butler and his team found that too many paper forms needed to be routed 
through various steps for approval. All these common service requests were 
streamlined, and the new process was documented in a service catalog (see 
the following section).
Creating a service catalog
Sometimes the simplest ideas have the biggest impact. The IT services team 
had a 700-page catalog of IT services that included a lot of information, but 
the format wasn’t very accessible and actionable. Elbit Systems of America 

230
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
took the very pragmatic approach of streamlining business processes for 
delivering IT services, implementing these processes, and documenting them 
by using service-catalog software.
How would you like to shorten a two-day process to two hours? That hap-
pened to employee requests for access after the service catalog implemen-
tation. Now employees can use the service catalog before a trip to request 
security clearance. If someone in Texas plans to travel to New Hampshire 
the following week, for example, she can use the service catalog to request 
physical security clearance so that when she arrives in New Hampshire, she 
can be ready to work. Previously, she had to e-mail someone requesting secu-
rity clearance. If that person was on vacation and didn’t get the notification 
e-mail, the consultant might not get clearance in time. He or she might waste 
several days this way that could have been used productively working. Now, 
if the person who is supposed to provide the service is gone, the system des-
ignates an alternate.
As the success of this small project permeated the organization, Butler’s 
team was inundated with other requests. Human resources, for example, 
wanted the team to automate some of the time-consuming manual processes 
involved with new hires and employee exits. Finance requested that its 
check-approval process be automated, and the department included input in 
the service catalog. Now the team has a rather long list of services that need 
to get into the service catalog.
Implementing a CMDB
The configuration management database (CMDB) is at the heart of Elbit 
Systems of America’s service-management strategy.
A CMDB stores all the information about all the assets across the company. 
In the case of e-mail, the company would store information about software 
such as Microsoft Outlook, the exchange servers, Internet access, routers, 
hubs, switches, firewalls, spam servers, e-mail–monitoring servers, and so 
on. It also has information about how exchange servers are connected to the 
Internet and to other servers. The IT team responsible for making sure every-
one has e-mail must know what’s included in the e-mail service. This makes 
it easier to fix a problem because, according to Butler, the reality is that you 
will never find one person in the organization that knows the entire hierarchy 
of how all servers are connected and interact with each other.
Now changes to the infrastructure are submitted 14 days in advance. They’re 
discussed and visualized so that the team can see what pieces are going to be 
involved. In the case of e-mail, for example, team members see the upstream 
and downstream effects of changing the exchange server and can notify the 
people who are going to be affected by the changes. If a change order doesn’t 
generate any potential problems, it’s approved and becomes standard. The 

231
 Chapter 19: Manufacturing
change-management process also helps identify rogue services. This process, 
then, helps reduce the number of problems in the infrastructure.
Employing virtualization
As the company’s service management strategy expanded, so did the number 
of servers. As IT added new tools, each tool had its own server. The company 
ended up with a service desk server, a service catalog server, a local asset 
management server, and an enterprise asset manager server. Across the five 
business units, Elbit Systems of America had five separate servers at each 
of 13 locations, totaling 65 servers around the globe. This configuration was 
hard to manage.
After virtualizing five separate servers onto one at each of the 13 facilities, 
Elbit reduced the number of physical servers by 52. The company has cut 
down on the amount of hardware it has to maintain, and the solution is more 
flexible. For example, if it needs more disk space or more RAM, it can do it on 
the fly rather than ordering more RAM and waiting for maintenance to install 
it. Now IT just buys a healthy chunk of RAM for the server and allocates it. 
This process also saves space, as well as electricity and cooling costs.
Establishing best practices
Elbit Systems of America’s service-management strategy has matured sig-
nificantly since 2001. Butler offers the following thoughts on best practices 
based on the company’s experiences:
 
✓ Don’t try to swallow the elephant all at once. Butler cautions you to 
take service management one step at a time. Start by focusing on one 
IT service that will have a big impact on the business. Take the time to 
understand the processes so that you can streamline and create a more 
efficient approach. A learning curve is involved, so plan to allocate some 
extra time for the first few services you deploy.
 
✓ Build credibility. Initially, when IT negotiated with the business, the 
business didn’t necessarily believe that a certain level of support would 
cost a certain amount of money. As the services rolled out and suc-
ceeded, the business started to understand how much it would cost to 
get a job done.
 
✓ Build relationships. Strong relationships go hand in hand with building 
credibility. It’s essential that IT understand the business needs and that 
all stakeholders use a common language. Everyone must be open to new 
ideas and new approaches. As Butler puts it, “Just because we have always 
done it that way doesn’t mean that’s the way we always need to do it. It 
was important for both sides of the house to keep an open mind.”

232
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
An important lesson from Elbit Systems of America’s experience with service 
management is recognizing that everything is a service, from giving employ-
ees mobile online access to ensuring the security of facilities, providing 
access to those buildings, and providing a check-approval process. Elbit 
Systems of America evaluated the manual processes involved in delivering 
these services and moved to take a more comprehensive and automated 
approach.
Cisco
Customer experience matters to Cisco, one of the world’s leading providers 
of hardware, software, and services for creating Internet solutions. Although 
the company is best known for its Internet Protocol (IP)-based network tech-
nologies, over time Cisco has dramatically expanded its business into new 
markets through strategic acquisitions. In adding companies such as WebEx 
and IronPort to the fold, Cisco has had to evolve its processes and systems 
to support multiple business models including traditional product, Software 
as a Service (SaaS), subscription, and IT as a service (ITaaS) offerings on a 
global scale. As one can imagine, such expansion over time has correspond-
ingly led to a rather heterogeneous IT portfolio.
In order to evolve their operating model from support and delivery of indi-
vidual technologies to a service provider model, Cisco has begun moving for-
ward with the adoption of a comprehensive service management framework. 
The purpose of the framework is to facilitate the conversion of the many 
technical capabilities the IT organization provides into discreet customer-
facing service offerings. One foundational building block in the execution of 
Cisco’s service management framework is the construction of a multi-layer 
service catalog.
Using the multilayer service catalog
Sean Worthington, vice president of IT, Business Services, leads the team 
responsible for the construction of the services catalog. In addition to using 
the catalog to provide transparency into the portfolio of services across 
the enterprise, another goal is to clearly identify owners of those services. 
“That’s a good barometer for me,” says Worthington, “because if we have 
applications that we can’t assign to a service, that begs the question ‘What 
purpose are those applications servicing?’ In this way, the catalog can be 
used as a guide to reduce the cost and complexity inherent in such a large 
enterprise IT environment. The company sees the catalog as a way to begin 
to streamline service delivery by getting rid of applications and technologies 
that aren’t being used effectively.

233
 Chapter 19: Manufacturing
“Conversely,” says Worthington, “if it turns out there are a bunch of required 
services we’ve defined in our catalog where there’s no application delivering 
them, that is an invalid outcome.” In this way, Cisco can also use its service 
catalog to guide prudent investment in new capabilities. In building its cata-
log, Cisco has developed a taxonomy used to group IT capabilities into three 
categories of services: foundational, client, and business.
Foundational Services
Foundational services are consumed by internal groups, processes, or func-
tions. This category includes such functions as database administration, 
hosting, storage, and network provisioning. The scope of these services is 
quite diverse. Worthington says, “That’s why the creation of the catalog is 
very important but also not a terribly easy task.”
Client Services
Client services are consumed by an individual and include the provisioning, 
management, and billing for services such as mobile devices, phones, PCs, 
and other items that get any employee up and running. The genesis of Cisco’s 
service management efforts can be traced back to 1999 when they imple-
mented an internally built application called Enterprise Management (EMAN) 
to automate client service delivery.
Business Services
The third category of services represents discreet business functions and is 
often exposed to the outside world. Under Guillermo Diaz Jr., vice president 
IT Customer Commerce, Services and Solutions, Cisco has executed a service 
oriented architecture (SOA) strategy as part of an ongoing commerce initia-
tive. (Refer to Chapter 6 for additional information on SOA.) The commerce 
platform includes business services for product pricing, discounting, and 
configuration, services that will be offered to channel partners over time. 
Initially, these services will be used by multiple internal groups as they build 
business applications. Cisco envisions that over the next few years its chan-
nel partners will begin to use the same services — standard components 
from Cisco — and expose them as widgets or portlets to create their own 
online selling experiences. In addition to the commerce platform business 
services, IT also offers other services to internal groups, such as video con-
ferencing and collaboration.
Enhancing the CMDB
At it continues to mature, the service catalog can further enhance the impor-
tant process of configuration and change management, another pillar of Cisco’s 
overarching service management framework. Worthington and Diaz believe 

234
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
that a solid CMDB is critical to the success of their overall plan to deliver 
services that meet customer requirements. Worthington refers to the CMDB 
as the “building list of materials for a service.” The idea is to take the basic 
CMDB concept that’s been with IT for quite a while and wrap value around 
it with the service catalog. Using the two together, the team can understand 
what each service offers and can list the components for a given service 
through the CMDB. Using the CMDB helps IT to understand how certain ser-
vices work together to support the business.
Managing service-level agreements
These mechanisms in turn help manage the service-level agreements that 
go with individual services. Understanding the interdependencies between 
service components has been a key focus of Cisco’s approach. For example, 
the business-level product pricing service might require 99.99 percent avail-
ability, but it depends upon other services from the catalog. This means that 
all the underlying services that support this service (such as database and 
network availability) also need to have the appropriate service levels in place 
to support the designated service level for pricing.
“As an IT client-facing person, I recognize that our clients and, ultimately, our 
end partners depend on IT services to always be available for their revenue 
generation,” Diaz says. “We need to provide the right service-level agree-
ments to our customers.” Of course, tradeoffs can occur between meeting 
customer expectations and supplying the necessary resources. If you want 
to ensure a higher degree of availability for a particular service, you need to 
improve the resiliency of the underlying foundational components — which 
can add to the complexity of the architecture. Sometimes adding an incre-
mental improvement to service availability requires an exponential increase 
in cost. How do you explain this to end users? According to Diaz, IT must be 
very clear about all the cost/benefit tradeoffs involved prior to establishing 
proper SLAs with customers. The service catalog and CMDB work in concert 
to clearly articulate these cost issues. Having an understanding for the inter-
dependencies can, in some cases, enable more granular, tiered offerings for 
service consumers to choose from where service availability is properly bal-
anced with associated cost.
Laying the groundwork for virtualization
Looking forward, as Cisco increasingly virtualizes its data-center environ-
ment; it must understand where a service is running and what its proper 
level of resiliency should be throughout the technology stack. In a virtualized 
world, you don’t want a priority-1 service, running in a virtual machine, to be 
migrated to a priority-6 physical host for example; that arrangement certainly 
wouldn’t meet service-level expectations. Both Diaz and Worthington agree 
that the service catalog will be increasingly important in the next generation 
of Cisco’s data center.

235
 Chapter 19: Manufacturing
Changing to a customer-experience 
mindset
According to Worthington, although moving IT to think of itself as an “inter-
nal service provider” is a big undertaking requiring detailed technical analy-
sis, cultural change management is the “bigger challenge.” The team believes 
that good change management depends on solid agreement and active steering-
committee membership by all IT leaders. To address these challenges, Cisco 
has established an IT steering committee that brings together a broad team 
with diverse opinions and perspectives in order to facilitate this transforma-
tion. The goal of the group is to bring value to all layers of the organization as 
it manages change.
Worthington and Diaz believe that the impetus for transitioning to a service 
management philosophy should come from the top. The chief information 
officer (CIO) must be 100 percent committed and articulate this commitment 
clearly to all business stakeholders. Although the company is still early in 
the process, it expects that delivering on customer expectations with regard 
to services will be a big part of operational and performance reviews going 
forward.
Services need to be measured on criteria such as the number of capabilities 
delivered, the quality with which they’re delivered, and the cost at which 
they’re delivered. These criteria become measurements of the customer 
experience. Worthington says. “There is really only one set of metrics that 
matters; the rest are diagnostics. The ones that matter are the experience 
metrics.”
By building a service management strategy based around this concept of 
customer experience, IT has increasingly delivered services in alignment with 
business requirements and priorities — further demonstrating its value as a 
strategic partner. The team responsible for service management has made 
sure as part of its analysis to tangibly demonstrate the financial benefits of its 
efforts. Diaz estimated that his Commerce IT team alone saved $1 million in 
the final quarter of 2008 through more efficient service management as sup-
ported by Worthington’s group. Such results will likely further Cisco’s pro-
gram to transform IT into thinking of itself as a services business.
Varian Medical Systems
Varian Medical Systems provides equipment and solutions for cancer-treatment 
centers. In addition, the company provides industrial testing products and 

236
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
x-ray linear accelerators for cargo security. The company’s more than 900 
service representatives are responsible for the company’s products, which are 
located in more than 5,000 locations worldwide. Varian implemented a service 
management strategy to add efficiency to equipment, device, and software 
service. The main goal was to evaluate the management process in terms of 
servicing the linear accelerators and software provided to oncology clinics.
Defining the challenges of the industry
When you understand how the equipment is used, recognizing the service 
challenge is easy. Radiation oncology treatment centers use linear accelera-
tor machines to provide radiation treatment to cancer patients. The linear 
accelerator is a very large unit that must be located in a specially designed 
concrete room. Outside the concrete room, the medical oncology team uses 
computer software, medical imaging technology, and other equipment to 
plan, deliver, and monitor treatments. A lot of patient data must be recorded 
to determine optimum treatment and monitor the accuracy of ongoing treat-
ment. Radiation oncology is a highly technical part of cancer treatment that 
requires precision in both the equipment and the health-care team.
Many problems can interrupt the continuous operation of the equipment. If 
the patient database goes down, for example, radiation treatment must stop 
because that database holds the information regarding patient equipment 
settings.
The main challenge for Varian was the time it took a technician to reach a 
site. Service calls generally involved several hours of travel time and then 
several hours to complete the repair. For customers in remote areas (such 
as in South America), the mean time to respond was much longer. Software 
questions could often be handled over the phone, but as Varian’s products 
became more complex, it became increasingly difficult for customers to 
describe problems over the phone. Dan DuBeau, program manager, remote 
access and Mission Critical Application Protection (MICAP), says, “You can 
have a help desk representative on the phone with a customer, and they are 
talking two completely different languages.” In 2000, the Varian team began 
looking at remote-access solutions with the expectation of improving the ser-
vice level provided to customers.
Implementing a remote-access solution
Varian Medical Systems had two main goals for implementing a remote-access 
solution: decrease service call mean time to respond and decrease escalating 

237
 Chapter 19: Manufacturing
travel costs. In addition, the company hoped to solve some of the communi-
cation problems that occurred when staff members tried to resolve customer 
problems over the phone.
Now when a customer uses Varian’s software products, either managing 
patient information or setting up a treatment, IT support can access the 
customer’s desktop remotely. A support representative can use the mouse 
and keyboard remotely, and the customer can see exactly what the Varian 
representative sees, watching the mouse move and viewing every keystroke. 
This solution is a great educational tool as well. Often, a customer needs to 
be trained. Also, if an on-site representative runs into something outside her 
area of expertise, she can have an expert from Varian access the application 
remotely and help the representative through the fix — a side benefit that 
Varian didn’t expect.
Creating a rotating service desk
In addition to providing remote desktop support, Varian representatives 
work on the company service desk. Most service representatives work from 
home, and many of these representatives do it all, repairing a piece of equip-
ment one day and working on a mainframe computer the next day. Varian 
also has two service forces out in the field.
The service representatives rotate their work responsibilities. A local repre-
sentative in Seattle, for example, normally would drive or fly to a customer 
site to fix a problem with the equipment. One week of the year, however, 
he stays at home with a computer and instant-messaging software to take 
direct customer calls. If he gets a call that requires someone on-site, he redis-
patches that call; otherwise, he handles the call remotely.
After Varian implemented its remote desktop solutions, it took a while for 
all the representatives and customers to use the system. The reality is that 
nothing replaces face time with a customer, so initially, the representatives 
were hesitant to use the product. Now most customers — indeed the vast 
majority — insist on remote access.
The company also has become more proactive in its problem management. The 
idea is to track what the customer’s doing now and send a dispatch to the 
customer before a problem occurs. Varian is currently looking at the lifetime 
of consumables — such as field lights on radiation therapy devices — to 
predict at what point a particular part of a machine will go out. Then Varian 
can send a service reminder and proactively change an important component 
before it fails.

238
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
Measuring the impact of 
service management
From a business standpoint, the company knew that it needed to determine 
the impact of the remote desktop solution. As DuBeau put it, “It is hard to 
measure what you are doing, but it is almost impossible to measure what you 
are not doing. And that’s what we really want to measure.” Varian is trying to 
measure how much has been saved by reducing travel time.
One metric that the company can track is remote-access usage hours, which 
totaled 17,000 in one month, including remote database upgrades and modi-
fications. Varian used this metric and other data on service requests and 
responses to calculate cost savings and the new mean time to repair. The 
savings have been significant, amounting to a 20 percent overall reduction in 
expenses due to the following:
 
✓ Reduced numbers of overnight hotel stays and plane tickets
 
✓ Increase in productivity resulting from decreased travel time and better 
customer communication
 
✓ Reduced number of service representatives required due to the increase 
in productivity (one representative can do three jobs in the time it used 
to take to do one)
An additional benefit is that Varian has an accurate audit trail of what cus-
tomers it has accessed, which helps customers meet compliance regulations 
such as HIPAA. The more the company automates its process, the easier it is 
to validate and verify that processes are sound. The true benefit of Varian’s 
improved service management approach, of course, is one that can’t be 
easily measured: delivering treatment to patients on time.

Health Care
In This Chapter
▶ The Medical Center of Central Georgia
▶ Independence Blue Cross
▶ Sisters of Mercy Health System
▶ Partners HealthCare
T
he U.S. health care industry is facing a perfect storm of challenges. The 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other 
government regulations require providers to adhere to national standards for 
electronic records and transactions. Health care providers and payers must 
cope with many other pressures, including an aging population, a growing 
number of people without medical insurance, falling government reimburse-
ment rates, and a growing shortage of qualified staff members.
In this difficult environment, health care insurance companies need to 
manage the relationships with health care providers and consumers. 
Pharmaceutical companies need to leverage data and best practices success-
fully across the entire health care system to ensure that they develop medi-
cines to address emerging needs.
At the center of this storm, medical costs are skyrocketing. Controlling health 
care costs while ensuring quality of care has become a hot issue for this 
industry. Service management is emerging as an important strategy for meet-
ing these challenges. Addressing problem and change management helps to 
decrease the down time of critical technology that clinicians and nurses use 
to treat patients and manage care, for example. The hospitals and insurance 
companies profiled in this chapter believe that service management helps 
reduce costs and ensure improved quality of care.
Innovation has become critical to success, so many companies are looking at 
ways to innovate. In this chapter, we profile four companies’ service manage-
ment efforts:

240
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
 
✓ The Medical Center of Central Georgia is using its service management 
system software to automate what were traditionally inefficient and/or 
paper-based business processes, and to manage customer service and 
change management.
 
✓ Independence Blue Cross deployed an operations control center to help 
monitor its systems and predict problems.
 
✓ Sisters of Mercy Health System transformed its clinical processes. IT 
supported this initiative by creating a more responsive technology 
infrastructure.
 
✓ Finally, Partners HealthCare deployed an innovative service oriented 
architecture strategy and is using a service catalog to help monitor the 
performance of its key services.
The Medical Center of Central Georgia
The Medical Center of Central Georgia, located in Macon, is a full-service 
acute-care hospital with more than 600 beds, serving about 750,000 residents. 
It’s now the second-largest hospital in Georgia. The hospital system also 
includes a series of remote health care facilities; wellness centers; health 
clubs; and home care, home health, and hospice services throughout the 
city. The Medical Center of Central Georgia’s core mission is to provide 
world-class care to its patients.
The IT department manages all servers, laptops, desktops, printers, scan-
ners, and various applications. Five years ago, Information Services realized 
that it needed to improve service management and needed to automate many 
business processes. IT had previously deployed a homegrown system for 
managing problems, but the system was inadequate to meet the needs of 
Information Services and the organization. These inadequacies hindered pro-
cess and workflow management, and eventually led to the need for a more 
robust system.
Ensuring high quality of care was a key concern. The IT team realized that it 
needed to change its approach. It began by implementing new service man-
agement software and processes and then expanded its vision to address 
change management. It also streamlined many of its business processes and 
reduced costs by using the service management software platform to auto-
mate and enforce business processes both within and outside IT.
Revamping the Technical Support Center
The Medical Center’s Technical Support Center (TSC) supports IT as a whole 
and has been particularly successful with its client services. Client services 

241
 Chapter 20: Health Care
technicians travel to different locations within the organization to deal with 
hardware and software issues. Before the service management system was 
implemented, each time a technician made a repair, he had to go back to the 
office or rely on a paging system to get the next service ticket. According to 
Patrice Briley, a lead analyst at the Medical Center, this service request could 
be in the same area the technician just left. The technician would have to go 
back to the area and then back to the office.
Now the organization is divided into zones. When a ticket is entered, the 
system makes logical decisions as to what zones and technician the ticket 
should be assigned; the routing is automatic. Rather than going back to a 
central area to get the next assignment or waiting for the TSC to make con-
tact manually, the technician simply receives the next assignment by pager 
or e-mail. The actual work request is entered into the system, along with the 
necessary information to allow the system to process automatically. This 
new process also helps to improve quality of care by enabling the techni-
cians to address problems faster and more efficiently. One big advantage of 
this approach, says systems analyst Isaac Ramsingh, is that the technicians 
“can be mobile rather than being tied to a physical computer or depending 
on an unreliable process to get the information they need. This has improved 
productivity tremendously.”
The same system is used for change control management. Any request for 
changes to systems is entered into the application. An automatic approval 
process is then initiated, with the appropriate managers reviewing and 
approving or denying the request for change as appropriate. Reports from 
this system also drive committees responsible for managing changes, ensur-
ing that each change is communicated effectively and any possible ill effects 
are identified. The intent is to thoroughly understand system interactions 
and proactively manage system changes.
Automating processes
The IT team is using the service management software platform to automate 
some of the manual, paper-intensive processes that encumbered IT produc-
tivity for years. One example is providing security access to systems for 
new employees. In the past, this task involved a paper-based process that 
may have involved as many as 10 or 11 system administrators. Now the new 
system takes the original request and splits it so that a subticket is sent to 
each system administrator involved, and manages the process of granting 
access to each of the systems required. New employees, or employees who 
have had their system access changed, can now sign into a centralized and 
secure Web page to retrieve all their system access information, like user IDs 
and passwords, along with documentation for each of their systems.
By leveraging the technology upon which the service management software 
was built the team has already developed nearly 20 independent applications 

242
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
to automate and manage various diverse processes. This kind of automation 
enables the company to cut costs, streamline business processes, and ensure 
adherence to policies and procedures.
Establishing best practices
Briley and Ramsingh mention several best practices that have emerged over 
the course of the Medical Center of Central Georgia’s service management 
journey, including the following:
 
✓ Bring the customer in up front. When you are creating a system, it is 
important to get the users and business experts involved. This ensures 
the needs of the users are met and fosters a sense of ownership. This 
sense of ownership and buy-in results in greater acceptance and a better 
end product for everyone. According to Briley and Ramsingh, if you 
don’t get the right folks involved at the onset of a project, it can result in 
a system that is poorly designed and not well accepted.
 
✓ Communicate. Communication is critical, especially when it comes to 
patient care. Being informed helps the staff take the necessary steps to 
ensure quality of care is not compromised. The TSC has become a single 
point of contact for dispersing information throughout the organization.
 
✓ Build a knowledge base. As a problem occurs, it is important to docu-
ment the steps taken toward resolution. The next time the problem 
occurs, resolution can be reached more quickly. The end result is better 
customer service.
Independence Blue Cross
Independence Blue Cross (IBC) and its subsidiaries are the Philadelphia 
region’s largest health insurers, with more than 3.4 million members. The 
company offers products and services such as managed care, traditional 
indemnity, pharmacy benefits management, Medicare, and Medicaid. IBC 
annually processes more than 32 million claims and responds to more than 
6 million customer inquiries. IBC’s information technology organization 
manages hundreds of applications that cover a wide area of business needs, 
from internal e-mail to external customer-facing systems. These include 
mission-critical solutions vital to the company’s success, in which unscheduled 
down time is not an option. For example, an outage during the critical enroll-
ment period could greatly hinder an individual’s ability to choose an appro-
priate insurance product.
In 2002, IBC initiated a grass-roots movement to implement the Information 
Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework to improve the provi-
sioning and control of IT services such as incident and problem management. 

243
 Chapter 20: Health Care
Although the objectives were on the right track, the effort failed to gain trac-
tion for several reasons. First, it didn’t address key issues such as root cause 
analysis, notifications, and escalation. Also, although IBC had a change man-
agement process in place, it was weak in that it was loosely mandated and 
had no transparency or accountability structure, and its Web-based environ-
ment was unpredictable.
Fortunately, a more recent review and overhaul of the process has allowed 
IBC’s Information Technology Team to institutionalize a vastly improved 
ITIL methodology, adding executive-level support and proactive capabilities. 
A crucial organizational change was the addition of an Operational Control 
Center (OCC), which monitors the systems and applications across the enter-
prise from the customer’s point of view, thereby providing substantial busi-
ness value.
Putting transparency 
back into the process
When Nick Robak, senior director of technology services, joined the team 
in 2005, he quickly saw a critical issue: the staff was handling incidents, but 
there was lack of accountability for any particular problem. This and other 
deficiencies in the service management process fueled the organization’s 
effort to gain more control of resources as well as more credibility with the 
business.
With the assistance of systems integrator Liquid Hub, IBC pored through 
the hundreds of applications that it manages and assigned severity codes for 
problem classification. An example of a priority-one application is the one 
that all agents and brokers use when working with customers. This applica-
tion provides customers comprehensive information about their policies and 
how those policies are set up. If that application becomes unavailable during 
the high-revenue or enrollment seasons, the company can be seriously 
affected.
After assigning the severity codes, IT identified the precise response mecha-
nism that would be used to resolve each problem. Robak’s team ensured 
that there was a well-defined and broadly communicated problem escala-
tion, notification, and communication process. All details of the process 
were negotiated with the sponsors and stakeholders over a period of several 
months. This resulted in consensus by all parties, and allowed the incident 
and problem management process to be tightly governed by IT. The com-
pany quickly began reaping rewards. For example, the average time to repair 
has decreased by 50 percent.
Additionally, IT implemented a strict change-control process that, along with 
incident and problem management, has lowered the number of priority-one 

244
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
problems by 50 percent. “Before we focused the team on change manage-
ment,” Robak says, “certain areas of the organization utilized a change man-
agement process, while others didn’t; we needed consistency.” IT instituted 
a more orderly and enforceable change management policy that includes, 
for example, submitting change notices before changes can occur.
Getting proactive for the business: 
The OCC
After IBC implemented these improved incident, problem, and change man-
agement processes, it examined how to proactively identify issues before 
they became problems. As is typical at many large companies, when an inci-
dent occurs, everyone from the database person to the network and applica-
tions person might be asked to help solve the problem. Needless to say, this 
process is inefficient and unnecessarily drains resources. The goal was to 
move away from a purely reactive service desk that only addressed problems 
as they happened, and move toward the ability to show a holistic picture of 
service to the end user which includes proactive capabilities. To do this, the 
team looked at its services from the end-user perspective, gaining an end-to-
end view of all the elements that make up a service, each of which could be 
monitored.
The idea to monitor services from an end-user perspective led to the creation 
of the OCC, which has a four-part mission:
 
✓ Proactively monitor the performance of critical business and technology 
services
 
✓ Routinely report ongoing operational metrics with a focus on improving 
them to match changing business priorities
 
✓ Coordinate performance improvements to resolve more incidents before 
they affect the consumer
 
✓ Deliver innovative solutions in process improvement, service quality, and 
increased systems performance to meet service-level agreements (SLAs)
The OCC is an organization that uses staff members from across Information 
Technology. Its members include service desk personnel, a Web environment 
administrator, enterprise monitoring personnel, SLA management and report-
ing experts, and those with executive dashboard expertise. The goal is that 
when the problem management staff is notified of an event or an anomaly, they 
can ask whether this issue is the start of a trend, and collaboration can begin 
among the members of the OCC to help predict and resolve larger issues.
If the OCC sounds a bit like a network operations center (NOC), which is used 
to monitor communications networks, that’s because in some ways it is. Like 
a NOC, the OCC is housed in a separate room (with glass windows) where 

245
 Chapter 20: Health Care
numerous large plasma screens provide a real-time view of activity across 
the company’s systems. Unlike a NOC, however, the OCC monitors the busi-
ness processes and services from the end-user perspective.
Monitoring and measuring are big parts of what the OCC does. According to 
Heath Durrans, director of managed infrastructure at LiquidHub, the primary 
purpose of the OCC is SLA management, which in this case is really business-
level management. The goal is to meet customer expectations for service. If 
a system is failing to meet those service level objectives, the OCC needs to 
find out why. The OCC wants to know and report how the business is doing 
this month, and how that compares to its performance last month. It con-
stantly monitors performance against expectations. The OCC might try, for 
example, to predict that a certain customer-facing application may go down 
on a certain day because of certain behavior and trends. It tracks both the 
application and how that application interacts with other applications and 
the infrastructure. The OCC supports both internal and external applications.
One internal service that the OCC monitors is how consumers get e-mail from 
the mail archive. How do you determine an acceptable performance level for 
retrieving e-mail? To answer this question, the team openly asked end users 
about their expectations for this service. It also mapped out all the hops — 
transfer between computers — that a message goes through across the 
entire infrastructure to retrieve an archived item. Then the OCC employed 
software agents and synthetic transactions to test availability, at the speci-
fied SLAs, to the end consumer. These test transactions are developed by IT 
to gauge how the system will respond under specific conditions.
The OCC has been a huge success. Robak says, “It’s one of those projects 
that happens every couple of years where you see all the lights go on. 
Showing real evidence of what is going on with these applications and staving 
off problems before they happen has created a whole lot of support.”
Identifying best practices
IBC has found that its internal and external customers are much happier now. 
Systems go down less often, and when they do, they’re fixed more quickly. 
The team has identified certain best practices that have helped along the way:
 
✓ Benchmarking: Robak’s team collected a three-month trend on service 
performance to use in negotiating SLAs. For example, it researched 
what a normal call response should be and then negotiated around that 
metric. However, a core OCC tenet is to not accept the norm but instead 
strive for service-performance excellence.
 
✓ Negotiating: IT must decide how to best support the business, but at the 
same time recognize the importance of balancing limited resources to 
ensure that critical systems remain stable.

246
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
 
✓ Setting priorities: IBC believes in the importance of both a unified ITIL 
practice that utilizes basic ITIL processes, and senior management 
endorsement and prioritization of these standards.
 
✓ Measuring results: IBC believes in gaining transparency in IT operations 
via clear reporting of operational metrics. These metrics also need to 
have built-in accountability. IBC knows who is responsible for fixing a 
particular problem and when that person needs to respond. All of the 
measurements and trends are provided to senior management on a 
regular basis.
Sisters of Mercy Health System
St. Louis-based Sisters of Mercy Health System (Mercy) operates 19 hospi-
tals, physician practices, outpatient clinics, health plans, and related health 
and human services in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma, and Texas. Mercy is the ninth-largest Catholic health care system 
in the United States based on net patient service revenue.
Mercy began planning for a more integrated IT platform to serve the busi-
ness and clinical needs of the health system in 2003. The initiative was moti-
vated by Mercy’s need to improve clinical service, quality, and safety while 
achieving operational efficiency and improving access to quality information. 
Mercy implemented applications to support enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) across its organization and to address clinical and revenue functions 
within its hospitals and physician clinics. Through this deployment, the 
health system aimed to update processes vital to quality clinical care, such 
as creating an electronic health record (EHR) for every Mercy patient. The 
EHR promised to reduce patient registration and scheduling hassles, manage 
and document all patient care, and aid in patient accounting. The technol-
ogy infrastructure supporting these new applications demanded high levels 
of availability and service. Mercy had to establish a more comprehensive, 
integrated service management approach — and it didn’t have a lot of time to 
complete this task when the applications went live.
Seeing the need for improved 
service management
Mercy’s leaders, including those in the IT division, recognized the stark dif-
ference between its current state and the vision of the new deployment. A 
few clinical services and business processes were automated, and IT pro-
vided nearly 100 percent availability for these systems around the clock. 
Most clinical functions didn’t heavily rely on IT infrastructure and service,

 Chapter 20: Health Care
however. If a doctor ordered something or created a prescription, she would 
write it out or dictate it.
Mercy’s service desk operation needed to become more efficient to address 
the increased IT load from new clinicians and physicians utilizing the EHR. 
Additionally, in 2006, consultants examined Mercy’s service management 
performance and found that poor processes and human error were leading 
to down time and other quality-of-service issues. Changes that weren’t well 
planned or were rushed often resulted in problems. The trouble-ticketing 
system, which didn’t distinguish among different types of problems and 
requests, was also causing problems: Nonurgent requests were sometimes 
resolved more quickly than urgent incidents.
Both senior IT and business executives agreed that they needed to strengthen 
the IT infrastructure and services quickly to support the project with the rock-
solid availability it needed to succeed. IT leaders began talking about required 
uptime, planning for “3 nines” (99.99 percent availability of systems). Even at 
that high level, those that used Mercy’s most important systems would still expe-
rience 8 hours and 46 minutes of down time per year. Additionally, it became 
clear that technology alone would not save the day. Equal focus on creating 
stronger processes was essential. Mercy needed to adopt service management 
and processes to ensure success. Mercy’s deployment goal was very aggressive. 
Service desk, asset, incident, problem, change, and release management were all 
included in the initial six-month design period. The hospital system had many 
requirements for its service management solution, which had to be modular, 
flexible, and streamlined across different areas and processes.
Prescribing a service management solution
Mercy leaders decided on an integrated solution to meet high availability 
needs. With so much infrastructure and so many applications, the team 
needed information to flow seamlessly from one process to the next. If an end 
user created a service request that then became an incident, Mercy wanted 
data from the request to populate the incident record automatically. If the 
incident required a change, Mercy wanted the system to feed the incident 
and change action automatically through the approval and change-authorization 
process. In case the fix failed, Mercy’s IT staff would have clear documenta-
tion to identify changes that could have caused the failure.
To meet its six-month deadline, Mercy “wanted to affect cultural change 
within our IT organization, so we did a big bang,” said Will Showalter, 
chief information officer for Mercy. With strong executive sponsorship, he 
recruited business-process managers and owners to help evangelize the ini-
tiative and organized “synthesis sessions” to let everyone see design and pro-
vide input. All managers attended ITIL foundations courses, and the rest of 
the IT crew participated in a lighter version of ITIL training before they were 
trained on the new tools and processes.

Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
Providing a service management makeover
Michael Zucker, director of process and quality for Mercy’s IT division, led 
the service management effort. He would have liked extra time for testing, 
of course, but he didn’t have that luxury. Mercy’s IT staff not only had to 
be trained in the use a new tool, but also had to adopt a more disciplined 
approach. With the clock ticking, Zucker knew that the initial live deployment 
was bound to face some hitches. “We tried to be very proactive in our com-
munication,” he says. “Executive sponsors were saying, ‘We are going to do 
it, so accept that — and once you accept that, here’s a plan to handle it.’”
Setting expectations
Setting expectations became a top priority. Zucker’s organization supplied 
end users and service desk staff information about potential problems and 
armed the service desk with guidance about how to address those problems.
This strategy helped the team navigate the inevitable bumps of the initial 
rollout in early 2008. Some IT staff members found the more rigorous service 
management process a bit cumbersome at first, but they got the message 
that it was important to “make sure they are thinking about it twice before 
taking action,” Zucker remarks. Still, the time crunch took a toll; the January 
2008 live deployment of the new application and processes was rough on 
many of Mercy’s IT teams. But Mercy has been working steadily to smooth 
out those initial rough edges. “We might not be where we want to be yet, but 
we are heading in the right direction,” says Showalter. “Continual process 
improvement and a focus on quality will always be with us.”
The system now supports both infrastructure and clinical applications, serv-
ing as a single system recording work done by any of Mercy’s 700 IT people. 
“Everything is recorded and managed here. It’s our vehicle to communicate 
and make sure the work gets done,” Showalter says. The integrated service 
management dashboard provides a much better reading on the health of sys-
tems and services, enabling IT to track more processes and metrics than before.
Refining the tracking system
Currently, Mercy is concentrating on refining the system through better disci-
pline and additional metrics. Mercy already tracks availability at the network 
level and is working to measure availability at the individual application level. 
“All the support processes are interrelated, and we can look at them,” Zucker 
says. “If something breaks down, it could be any number of things. Now if a 
user complains about slowness, we can more easily identify the root of the 
problem and direct it to the right service group to get it resolved faster.”
Better discipline and visibility have helped Mercy improve accuracy, deliver 
higher availability, and respond more effectively when an issue does arise. Staff 
members can now distinguish between an incident (which requires immediate 
attention) and a request (which isn’t urgent), and apply different metrics to each.

249
 Chapter 20: Health Care
Mercy’s IT division also introduced policies and metrics regarding standard 
and unplanned changes, and tracks these changes with specific key perfor-
mance indicators. Improved metrics and tracking help identify processes that 
aren’t compliant. If the metric mandates that all priority-one incidents need 
to be resolved within eight hours, the tools enable staff to spot any metrics 
that look suspicious and take remedial action.
Conducting customer and user surveys
Mercy conducts regular broad customer satisfaction surveys across the orga-
nization, uses a link from the system that provides feedback and ratings on 
service for individual incidents, and surveys users about specific incidents. 
User satisfaction and other key metrics improved in all categories from 
January 2008 to the same time the following year.
Achieving a healthy prognosis
In late 2008, Mercy installed an additional component that can move its asset-
tracking functions to a configuration management database (CMDB). Currently, 
Mercy is adding new service-catalog functionality for different IT services to the 
CMDB, with 20 IT teams using the catalog management function to define indi-
vidual service lines and the discrete services that they can provide to end users 
(and to one another). With this capability, IT staff members and users can view 
and order services as they would from an Internet-based retailer. Requests for 
infrastructure services (such as network or voice) and for clinical and business 
services are logged. The service catalog helps users throughout the organization 
find the services they need quickly and determine the right team for the job.
Going forward, Mercy’s strong, consistent, and ongoing executive commit-
ment will drive continuous improvements. The original implementation team, 
consisting of both business-process managers and IT personnel, now serves 
as a process board, discussing, prioritizing, and authorizing process changes. 
The application itself also helps enforce more discipline in processes and 
provides metrics that flag areas that are out of compliance.
Given that Mercy Health accomplished its service management transforma-
tion in record time, Mercy’s IT leaders are often asked how the health system 
managed to get so much done in such a short time. They attribute its success 
to a few key factors:
 
✓ Strong executive sponsorship that established service management as a 
critical corporate priority
 
✓ Thorough evaluation and selection of comprehensive solutions that 
provided the necessary tools up front, as well as the ability to integrate 
additional components on Mercy’s own schedule
 
✓ Set expectations up front, and established proactive, open, and collab-
orative processes to facilitate change

Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
 Partners HealthCare
Partners HealthCare, a not-for-profit organization, is the largest provider of 
medical services in Massachusetts. It was founded in 1994 by two of the top 
hospitals in the country, both in Boston: Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and 
Massachusetts General Hospital. It includes large hospitals, community hospi-
tals, primary care and specialty physicians, the two founding academic medical 
centers, specialty facilities, community health centers, and other health-related 
entities. Its goal is to provide “a continuum of coordinated high-quality care.”
In 2000, Partners began to implement a service oriented architecture (SOA) 
strategy to share information in-network and among partners. In this way, 
patients can get the best possible care regardless of which facility they go to.
As Partners developed its portfolio of services, it realized that it needed a 
way to manage these services more effectively. Partners started a rudimen-
tary process for vetting service requests, part of which involved arranging 
the services in a catalog that people could access. At first, the catalog was 
nothing more than a spreadsheet with information about the services; over 
time, it became a database that allowed users to request services.
As the services strategy evolved, IT had to provision these services and grant 
license to use them. This requirement set in motion a whole set of concerns 
related to use monitoring, performance monitoring, and security assur-
ance. Partners needed to refine its approach to service management. This 
refinement included developing a monitoring and performance management 
strategy to ensure that services were meeting SLAs. In addition to monitoring 
service performance, the team made sure that it had a sound capacity man-
agement process in place so that unexpected spikes in service consumption 
didn’t bring down the house.
Monitoring services
You can monitor a service at many levels. One of the first things that Partners 
needed to monitor was whether the consuming application was authorized to 
use a particular service. The IT team, under the direction of Steve Flammini, 
chief information officer of the information services group at Partners, imple-
mented a security gateway to examine the credentials of the service call. 
That way, IT confirmed an authorized user and could attribute a level of use 
with that consumer.
The team also monitors the performance of the service at any given time and 
determines whether that performance meets its SLA requirements (if a SLA 
has been negotiated for the service). Flammini notes that in many cases, his 
team negotiates a SLA that is purely between the provider and the consumer. 
No blanket SLA applies to all consumers. IT works with different consumers 

251
 Chapter 20: Health Care
to analyze their needs. If a specific performance level is required, a cost can 
be established, the consuming organization agrees, and the performance 
level can technically be met, the SLA is implemented.
A given application may need to do a medication lookup on a medication for-
mula, for example; that service is a standard service. According to Flammini, 
you don’t want several applications designing their own medication lookups. 
This service is a core piece of functionality that should be offered in the 
enterprise as a service. The SLA may be that when the consuming application 
(such as an electronic record in which prescriptions are written) issues a call 
to do a drug search, that result needs to be returned within 200 milliseconds. 
Before the implementation, the team does some load and performance test-
ing, and performs simulations to ensure that the service can really turn this 
functionality around within that amount of time.
A lot of services used by a lot of applications can mean a lot of negotiation. 
The team delivers high-performance services that can scale, and in most 
cases those services are well within the performance window of any appli-
cation’s potential needs. The team can deliver this result because it has a 
sound underlying architecture and has done ample load testing.
Service performance may be affected by how often a service is consumed, 
so the team also tracks consumption patterns within the infrastructure. And, 
when a service doesn’t meet its SLA, the team has to do some diagnostic 
investigation to see whether the service is being overly consumed. If some-
one applied to consume a service 10,000 times a day but actually calls it 
100,000 times a day, that’s overconsumption. The team looks at the consump-
tion pattern and the infrastructure to find hot spots.
Planning capacity needs
In some cases, the team sees a much larger jump in usage on a particular ser-
vice than it thought it would see. According to Flammini, the cause could be a 
bad design decision, an invocation bug, or explosive uptake in these services 
for various applications.
One example of a service that’s experienced a large uptick in demand is the 
Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI), which was rolled out in 2005. In this 
identity-driven system, a patient’s medical-record number is attached to all 
of his charts and paperwork. If a patient who’s normally treated at one hos-
pital in the network goes to another hospital or provider, that provider can 
request patient information by using these services. In effect, the EMPI is a 
unique customer identifier. Virtually all applications across the enterprise — 
whether they were developed in-house or purchased, and whether they are 
clinical, administrative, or data warehousing applications — depend on the 
EMPI as their source of patient information and identity. This service may be 
called upon tens of millions of times per day.

252
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
Partners on the back end must to be prepared to handle the growth. This 
requires capacity planning. According to Flammini, it sounds like “mother-
hood and apple pie” to say that you have to sit down with IT and clinical 
systems leadership to understand how aggressively that organization wants 
to push out systems and understand their growth projections. However, the 
IT team needs to understand these plans so they don’t get caught in a growth 
situation they may be unable to handle.
For example, in the case of the EMPI, IT sits down with the consumer to try 
to understand their consumption patterns. Are they going to have to call the 
EMPI service a dozen times each time they open a patient record — or just 
once? Or are they going to continually call upon a service for data, or will 
they store that data locally to avoid calling repeatedly?
Identifying team roles
What happens when a problem occurs? Where does the organization turn? 
Partners has multiple service-provider teams that are experts in certain 
clinical domains such as medications or the EMPI. Each team has designers, 
developers, and support people who really understand the inner workings of 
these services and can work with consumers to resolve issues.
In addition to the specialists, Partners has a group of generalists who support 
the infrastructure, look at the underlying technology platform, and monitor 
whether CPU use is out of bounds. This group also looks at various levels of 
the infrastructure.
Partners has had great success with its SOA strategy, and part of that suc-
cess has come from learning to manage these services. Although the need for 
a service management strategy was an outgrowth of a technical requirement, 
the result is that the company is now using its services in applications that it 
hadn’t even imagined, and the service management strategy is enabling IT to 
deliver real value to the organization.

Retail

▶ Virgin Entertainment Group
T
he retail market is highly competitive. If consumers don’t like what 
they see in your stores, they might simply take their business else-
where. Retailers understand that today, more than ever, they must deliver a 
memorable and positive customer experience. For companies that focus on 
entertainment-related products, such as music and movies, the competition 
is even more intense.
Although mom-and-pop stores still exist, the trend has been toward larger 
chains and giant multinational corporations. To win the hearts and minds of 
customers, many large retail stores need to provide top-notch service as well 
as a memorable experience. They may provide some form of entertainment in 
the store itself (such as a light-and-sound show or memorabilia), or they may 
furnish kiosks where customers can listen to music or sample movies, which 
helps close the deal faster.
 
The key to customer satisfaction is the same whether you’re in a small or large 
store: Exceed customer expectations.
In this chapter, we profile Virgin Entertainment Group and, in particular, its 
U.S. Virgin Megastores. The IT group servicing these stores realized that it 
needed to provide its customers an experience that was always on. This goal 
meant that the hardware and software used in the stores — especially the 
software that completed sales — had to be maintained properly, which led 
the company to deploy an aggressive service monitoring strategy.
Virgin Entertainment Group
Virgin Entertainment Group is a subsidiary of Richard Branson’s Virgin Group 
conglomerate. The company has annual revenue of about $200 million. It 
sells everything from music, movies, books, and videogames to electronics 
and lifestyle fashion. It also has an e-commerce and social networking site. 
Although its stores in the United States are closing, the company owns and 

254
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
operates about 150 Virgin Megastores in France, Japan, Australia, and the 
Middle East, all owned by local companies with licensing agreements that 
lead back to Branson.
According to Robert Fort, chief information officer of Virgin Entertainment, 
the company had a critical need for real-time information about everything 
from sales to overall operational data. When Fort was walking through a 
store early in his tenure, he realized how important the customer experience 
was to the success of the brand. The company prides itself on providing a 
dynamic in-store environment, knowing that it has only a short time to make 
a positive impression on a customer. “Once we had established that cus-
tomer experience, we realized it could be easily undermined by an inopera-
tive kiosk or a register that was not working properly,” he says. These kinds 
of problems could damage the company’s bottom line.
(Store) room for improvement
Fort quickly determined that the company needed to monitor — proactively 
and persistently — all the services and features that it offered customers. By 
doing so, it could get right on top of any outages and, more important, “get 
out in front of those so that they don’t even occur,” he says.
Fort assessed his own organization and realized that he didn’t have the 
resources to check every kiosk touchscreen. He wanted to monitor the 
uptime of all critical components, which included in-store technology and all 
the backbone components from IT, such as key servers, point-of-sale (POS) 
servers, and the registers right on down to the kiosks themselves.
A critical element of the monitoring strategy is its business focus. When a 
problem occurs, that problem is immediately tied to a business process. 
If a key network component fails, the IT department immediately becomes 
aware of which business processes are affected, such as credit processing or 
kiosks. Then it notifies the stores involved about the issue and takes correc-
tive actions to prevent any effect on customers. A kiosk’s failure at the same 
time as a credit failure is deemed to be less critical than the credit failure, so 
IT prioritizes its responses and resources appropriately.
The circle game
As the IT team embarked on its service monitoring effort, Fort realized that 
he needed to determine the most critical components of the Megastore 
infrastructure. He drew a series of concentric circles to help him organize 
his thoughts around these components. The innermost circle included core 
critical servers, network, and voice over IP (VoIP) components. The next 
circle contained the POS servers, which would bring all sales at a store to a 

255
 Chapter 21: Retail
screeching halt if they went down. This circle also contained credit services, 
which depend on the network to get customers’ credit cards validated. (A 
store could continue to accept credit cards if the network was down, of course, 
but it would assume greater risk.) The next circle out included the registers, 
the circle beyond that one included the kiosks . . . you get the picture.
The failure of a single register or a single kiosk is less important than the 
failure of the whole system, but it still leaves a negative impression with 
customers. Typically, one register would fail and wouldn’t be reported to the 
help desk. When the help desk finally got a call, the report was that multiple 
registers were down and associated monitors weren’t functioning.
Overarching everything in the retail space is the Payment Card Industry 
(PCI) initiative, which includes mandates from card companies such as Visa 
MasterCard on how to protect customer data. Fort knew that he had to moni-
tor the credit process very tightly, making sure that IT was aware of any out-
ages or anomalies so that the company was PCI-compliant.
Monitor the infrastructure; 
think about the business
The team implemented a commercial monitoring application that could 
answer questions like these:
 
✓ Is the machine running?
 
✓ Does it have the appropriate amount of disk space?
 
✓ Does it have memory problems?
 
✓ Is it connected to the network?
The software also monitors application, database, and operating systems. In 
all, the team monitors more than 2,000 components. Any number of compo-
nents make up a business process, and a failure in any physical component 
could affect one or more business processes. The team also can monitor 
individual business transactions such as credit card purchases, which helps 
Virgin remain compliant with PCI.
Fort is quick to point out that although the company is monitoring these 
components at a technical level, it receives information about the impact of 
events at a business level. At the technical level, you can imagine that the 
networks at each of the stores has a key router and switch to connect to the 
network cloud; behind those routers and switches are the POS servers and 
the individual registers, kiosks, media players, and digital signs.
At the technical level, someone may see the problem as being a router fail-
ure. At a business level, however, someone may see the problem as being an 

256
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
inability to process credit or sales. When a router goes down, the monitoring 
team not only sees red flags, but also knows which series of business pro-
cesses is being affected, which helps the team determine the level of priority.
When IT knows the business impact, it can make the appropriate decision. 
A problem that might affect $100,000 worth of sales that day (if the registers 
go down, for example) gets top priority; it needs to be fixed no matter how 
much the repair costs. If, on the other hand, the issue might affect $20 worth 
of sales (a digital sign isn’t working, for example), expediting a fix for it isn’t 
worth a huge expense.
Don’t light my fire
Automated monitoring meant a change for the network engineering team, 
which was used to a firefighting mentality. If something went wrong, team 
members got involved. It was a bit of a shift to look at a dashboard that lit up 
and a sent e-mail to report that something was amiss. The alert e-mail didn’t 
necessarily say that the system had crashed — it might simply say that a 
database table increased by more than 10 percent in a single day — but it 
could predict a problem that needed investigation. The idea was to prevent 
the fire from coming.
This change affected many engineers’ personal measures of success, because 
no one would necessarily know that he’d averted a potential disaster. In fact, 
several engineers left the organization to move to areas where they could 
start building new networks.
Fort attributes this situation to a maturity curve, saying that some personal-
ity types may find it unrewarding to monitor smoke instead of fighting raging 
fires. He imagines it this way: On the left side of a firefighting icon are the 
data-center-minded people, who are very process-oriented types who believe 
in governance and don’t particularly care for fires. On the other side of the 
icon are the people who love fires, are always off to something new, and love 
to push boundaries. Fort believes that every organization going through ser-
vice management will eventually move from one side of the icon to the other.

D
o you simply want a clean bed to sleep in when you travel, or do you 
opt for luxurious accommodations with a health club, infinity swim-
ming pool, and Zen-style spa? Or do you insist on a green hotel with an envi-
ronmental conscience? Whatever your preference, many of the largest hotel 
management companies operate multiple brands catering to a wide variety of 
market segments.
The competition in this industry is intense and has become even more chal-
lenging given the sharp decline in spending on leisure and business travel as 
both families and businesses tighten their budgets. Businesses in the hospi-
tality industry use the diversity and quality of their services as a way to dif-
ferentiate themselves from the competition. Although the quality of services 
such as housekeeping, restaurant meals, room service, and concierge assis-
tance depends heavily on the performance of hotel staff, a lot of technical 
infrastructure is required in the background. The organization needs an agile 
and efficient infrastructure to focus on optimizing the customer experience. 
Guest profiles, housekeeping status, staffing reports, and other operations 
data must be available on demand to hotel management to ensure a positive 
experience for guests.
In addition, large hotel and resort companies employ many channels to serve 
customers, including the Web, call centers, travel partners, global distribu-
tion systems, travel agents, and other intermediaries. If you want your guests 
to keep coming back, they need on-demand access to room rates and avail-
ability from their preferred channels. Companies such as the one profiled 
in this chapter have implemented a service oriented architecture (SOA) to 
deploy these services more effectively. You can’t deploy SOA, however, if 
you don’t have the techniques in place to manage and govern these services. 
Managing the business services of an SOA environment is an integral part of 
a holistic approach to service management. (For more information on SOA, 
see Chapter 6.)

258
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
This chapter looks at the experience of one of the largest hotel groups in the 
world to show how it’s leveraging a technology center of excellence to ensure 
effective governance of its many SOA-based business services.
InterContinental Hotels Group
InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) includes a large, diverse group of well-
known names in the hospitality industry: InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, 
Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts, Holiday Inn Hotels & Resorts, Holiday Inn 
Express, Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, and Hotel Indigo. The organi-
zation also manages Priority Club Rewards, which is the world’s largest hotel 
loyalty program, with more than 37 million members worldwide. The group 
manages more than 4,000 hotels in more than 100 countries.
Since 2002, IHG has deployed SOA to provide agility and efficiency. The fol-
lowing example illustrates how IHG leveraged SOA to improve its focus on 
customer service. Customer loyalty is very important to IHG, as evidenced 
by the success of its Priority Club reward system. The customer-loyalty divi-
sion might access the SendGift service to send a thank-you gift to guests. 
On the other hand, the distribution division can reuse the same SendGift 
service to send coupons to other Priority Club members whom it feels might 
book a room at one of its hotels. As the company saw the number of services 
climbing — and the projected growth of the number of service consumers 
climbing even more rapidly — it recognized the need to ensure standards 
and governance. This situation happened when the company had deployed 
somewhere between 50 and 100 services.
Creating a center of excellence
IHG’s chief information officer, Tom Conophy, who joined IHG in 2006, 
emphasized the need for governance as part of a disciplined service manage-
ment process. He felt that the Global Technology organization needed to 
optimize its management of the growing number of business services. To do 
this, the company created what it called the Advanced Technology Platform 
(ATP). The vision and principles of service management and governance 
were embodied in the development of the ATP Center of Excellence (COE), 
instituted in 2008.
The ATP COE is a virtual body. Its members (all at director level or higher) 
are from departments across global technology at IHG that represent various 
service domains. A guest is one domain, for example. For a hotel company, 
the domain guest is very important. The person at the director level who 

259
 Chapter 22: Hospitality
owns the guest domain is the representative in the COE. Other domains 
include hotel, owner, product, revenue, and reservation.
Here’s how the COE works: When the business generates a new initiative, 
a member of the IHG enterprise architecture team studies it, determines 
what domains it will affect, and contacts the domain owners. This research 
occurs in the early stages of a project, when funding has been approved but 
the service hasn’t been designed, to give the governance team early involve-
ment in the process. If a new service involves the guest domain, for example, 
the guest-domain owner is notified. Then the domain owner determines 
what kind of information will be requested, as well as any required changes. 
Because a change to one service may affect other services, a dialogue often 
begins among domain owners.
The COE provides a holistic view of all the managed business services and 
institutes a process for vetting decisions about services. The group has the 
power to mandate change. Its two top priorities are managing the life cycle 
of services and improving the process for managing provider–consumer 
relationships.
Managing the service life cycle
One of the COE’s key goals is developing an ongoing process to manage ser-
vices from a life-cycle perspective. Bill Peer, director of enterprise architec-
ture in IHG Global Technology, says, “Once you have your services identified, 
they have a life cycle of their own. They have their own birth, generation, 
existence, and death. You need to accommodate all phases of life of these 
services.” An enterprise the size of IHG has many domains staffed by people 
with varying levels of expertise. No one person can know everything about 
every service.
Unanticipated situations occur as services age. Many challenges occur in 
relationship to change management. A service may have operated just fine 
for several years under the direction of a particular business unit, but evolv-
ing business priorities shook things up a bit. A different business unit initi-
ated a new business opportunity, which required an upgrade to the original 
service.
Before moving forward, the company had to answer the following types of 
questions:
 
✓ Who created this service?
 
✓ Who has the authority to make a change?
 
✓ Who do we need to contact to understand the full impact of making 
changes in the service?

260
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
 
✓ How many versions of this service should be maintained?
 
✓ Are different service versions compatible?
Before the development of the COE, questions such as these were hard to 
answer and possibly weren’t considered at all.
Collaboration between domain owners
As services become more complex and more widely used, good communica-
tion among service providers and users became essential. At IHG, domain 
owners vary the types of communication about services depending on com-
plexity. The logical approach for handling a trivial issue is using e-mail that 
gets captured, stored, and chronicled. When technical requirements demand 
greater interaction, the domain owners discuss the issues during a formal 
meeting. The enterprise architecture group facilitates meetings of this type. 
According to Peer, one of the key benefits of the COE is that the “collective 
knowledge of the group really makes this thing work.”
Meeting service levels
Every service has a service-level minimum to adhere to. One application 
may have to respond in 100 milliseconds; another, in 150. Both applications 
use one or more services. IHG always develops its services to accommodate 
the shortest interval of time. That 100-millisecond response time becomes 
the service-level agreement (SLA) unless another request requires 75 mil-
liseconds, in which case the response time can be adjusted. Therefore, dif-
ferent applications don’t have unique response times. The team members 
understand that this approach involves trade-offs, but they chose it for its 
simplicity.
The group discusses hardware and operational cost implications before 
agreeing to change something, such as a response time. A business reason 
for lowering that response time may exist, yet the hardware costs may be 
prohibitive. The business always gets involved. The COE highlights the pros 
and cons of changing the SLA and then presents the details to the business to 
decide whether it can pay the price.
Sometimes, the process isn’t as straightforward as getting one business unit 
to agree to a change. If an SLA has to be met for a broader project (such as 
a marketing or brand-driven project), the team turns to a businessperson in 
that guest domain. That person may or may not be in the reporting structure 
of the part of the business unit that’s requesting the change, so getting the 
business units talking is important. The units can decide whether it’s pos-
sible to share the cost and, if not, who will pay it.

Finding a balance
Peer is quick to point out the importance of finding a balance in the gover-
nance process. He believes that if governance is too formal, it stifles inno-
vation. On the other hand, a governance process needs to be in place. His 
team’s process appears to be working. Peer structured the process to make 
it part of the project-initiation request process, which has become an early 
indicator for the business coming down the pike. The COE has helped give 
multiple domain owners advance knowledge of changes in business services. 
Taking a life-cycle approach to service management helps IT be more respon-
sive to business needs.

▶ Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke
C
omputer technology is becoming ubiquitous in schools around the 
world. Students routinely use computers to research and write papers. 
Teachers use computer technology when planning lessons, enhancing class-
room instruction, and posting assignments. Even some courses starting in 
middle school teach children how to use a computer for media design. As 
some of today’s students begin using computers at home before they even 
learn to read, they feel very comfortable with the increasing use of technol-
ogy. Finding the best way to integrate computer technology equitably across 
different schools in a community is often a hot topic of debate among educa-
tors, but for purposes of this chapter, put the debate aside.
Assuming that all things are equal, how do you maintain classroom technol-
ogy? You can’t have a technician waiting at every school. Besides, more and 
more computers are arriving while budgets are falling.
In this chapter, we consider the situation of Commission scolaire de la 
Région-de-Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada. The school board’s technology 
demands were increasing, and expanding the service team wasn’t an option. 
The organization used a service management approach to help it manage and 
maintain its technology more effectively while still fulfilling its mission.
Commission scolaire de la 
Région-de-Sherbrooke
The Sherbrooke school board serves 20,000 students in Quebec. Its IT group 
is responsible for maintaining the computer technology in all the region’s 
schools. The service technicians were well trained and good at their jobs, 
but the school board was facing a problem: The school’s budget was falling 
because fewer students were enrolled, but the number of computers was 

264
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
increasing as technology became an integral part of the learning process. At 
one point, the IT department actually slowed computer purchases because of 
maintenance considerations.
Historically, different technicians had serviced different schools. Some of 
these technicians did everything — even replacing toner cartridges in the 
printers, planning computer purchases, and supporting software for teach-
ers. Others were more focused on dealing with computer-related problems.
The IT department at the school board realized that it needed to provide 
quality, uniform service across the schools more effectively. Achieving this 
goal meant making some painful choices, such as deciding which services 
would have the best payback and support the school board’s mission. 
Accordingly, IT reorganized the technical support team and implemented a 
service management strategy to help streamline maintenance.
Organizing to succeed
IT management’s first step was tackling inconsistent service. To train the 
technicians to work together, IT sent them all to a program in which they 
simulated an airport and had to work together to schedule airplane depar-
tures. At first, as typically is the case, the process was chaotic; in other 
words, the team didn’t come together well. The technicians soon realized the 
importance of organizing to meet a goal, however.
The next step was identifying a set of service management tools to help the 
team succeed. A service desk was at the top of the list. IT encountered a 
snag, though: In Quebec, most school-board technicians are part of a union. 
Implementing a service desk required talking to the union representatives to 
make sure that they understood the aim of the changes: not to change the 
job requirements, but to make technicians more efficient. The process took a 
bit of time, but eventually agreements were shored up, and the team was set 
to roll.
Deploying the strategy
The team began to deploy its service management strategy with a focus on 
three key areas:
 
✓ Asset management
 
✓ Desktop management
 
✓ Incident management

265
 Chapter 23: Education
Asset management
A configuration management database (CMDB) stores all the asset informa-
tion across the schools. Before the CMDB was implemented, the school 
board kept a semiautomated inventory of all computer-related hardware 
and software. As the number of computers exploded, keeping the list up to 
date was a difficult, time-consuming process. After implementing the asset 
management software, which did automatic discovery, the team had time to 
engage in more productive work. The tool also gave the management team 
the information it needed for use in budget planning, such as calculating the 
computers-to-students ratio for each school.
Desktop management
In addition to getting its hardware under control, IT was interested in manag-
ing its software installations more effectively. Instead of having technicians 
do the work at each site, the team used desktop management software that 
enabled IT to stream software installations to the school board’s comput-
ers. This method also allowed IT to track what software was running on the 
school board’s machines. Management refers to this system as “on-demand 
installation.” If someone wants to install a Microsoft product on her machine, 
for example, she simply chooses it from a menu of supported programs, and 
the software is installed automatically.
Incident management
The school board is also trying to deal with incident management more pro-
ductively. Before the service desk was launched, all the technicians spent a 
lot of time traveling. Now the team is transitioning to a remote management 
process, adding technicians to the process one at a time. First, the team asks 
one technician to do business as usual (such as traveling to different sites) 
while it monitors him; then the team asks him to do the same type of work 
remotely.
The school board will end up with a limited number of field workers; the rest 
of the technicians will work remotely, going to a school only for hardware 
problems (which must be repaired on-site). This system increases the time 
that technicians can spend solving requests.
Changing the way things are done
The new process takes some getting used to. For one thing, IT is specifying 
exactly what the technicians should do. Says Philippe Caron, adjoint direc-
tor of IT, “People like a gray line because then they can ask a technician to 
do something that really isn’t in his job description. Under the new process, 
school staff members have to do some things themselves.” To help them 

266
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
along, IT is creating self-service documentation for tasks such as changing a 
printer cartridge.
Establishing best practices
Caron recommends that organizations begin with a framework to implement 
change successfully. “When the department of finance makes a decision, it 
bases its actions on laws. IT should also base its decisions on tangible poli-
cies and processes,” he says.
After spending a lot of time researching frameworks, IT implemented the 
Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is a best-
practices framework. (For more information about ITIL, see Chapter 5.) 
Caron’s group suggests the following best practices, which Caron calls Think, 
Read, and Adapt:
 
✓ Think: This best practice involves considering questions such as how 
to implement the framework, whether successful applications and pro-
cesses can be reused, how to identify the strengths and weaknesses of 
IT services, and how to identify and assess priorities.
 
✓ Read: Locate some documentation on the process you want to imple-
ment, and find examples of business-related experiences that relate to 
your company. Read as much as you can about the process you want 
to use.
 
✓ Adapt: Don’t implement a framework directly; framework theories are 
created to meet many needs. Don’t be afraid to implement only the parts 
of processes that fit your precise needs.
 
 Persuading people inside IT that a framework is needed is fairly easy; 
persuading others can take a bit longer.
Caron says that every day, people tell him that they’re happy with the new 
service center. Although staff members miss seeing certain technicians at 
their schools, they like the on-demand service, which means that they don’t 
have to wait for a preassigned service day. The most significant benefit has 
been enabling the school board to do a better job of achieving its mission: 
providing the best educational environment for its students so that all of 
them can learn, excel, and graduate.

Service Provider
In This Chapter
▶ CIBER, Inc.
S
ervice providers are in the business of managing other companies’ IT 
operations. By providing technology-based services to multiple custom-
ers, they offer economies of scale and skill. Rather than bearing the costs 
of IT specialists and infrastructure on their own, customers can turn over 
part or all of their IT operations to service providers that offer a pool of 
highly specialized technical talent, resources, capabilities, and processes. By 
spreading these investments out over many customers, service providers can 
offer reduced IT costs and higher-quality services.
Before turning over any part of IT operations to a service provider, however, 
a customer must have confidence that the provider will satisfy the com-
pany’s unique business, technological, and governance requirements. To do 
this cost-effectively for a broad range of customers, service providers need 
an accountable, responsive organization, as well as the tools and processes 
that enable them to deliver flexible, streamlined services.
In this chapter, we profile CIBER, Inc., an international system integration 
consultancy and outsourcing company. By definition, the company must pro-
vide service management capabilities to its clients to ensure that customer 
expectations are being met. An important part of this service is delivering 
on service-level agreement (SLA) commitments. The company is evolving 
its SLAs from technically focused to business focused as the trend becomes 
more prevalent.
CIBER
CIBER provides a wide variety of IT services, from physical data center serv-
ices through different types of infrastructure software support to technical 

268
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
database administration, to customers throughout the United States, Europe, 
and Asia. Its IT Outsourcing Division (ITO) focuses on supplying operations 
and infrastructure outsourcing services to companies in a wide variety of 
industries.
In a typical scenario, an ITO transition project manager works with a new 
client to resolve architectural issues and optimize the IT environment before 
migrating to a hosted production environment. After a new customer’s 
deployment is live, an ITO service manager takes over day-to-day manage-
ment. As a primary component of the managed service, CIBER has imple-
mented a robust monitoring and reporting capability to ensure that its SLAs 
are not being breached, as well as to prevent and remediate any incidents in 
the enterprise it is serving.
Service management solutions: 
Then and now
When ITO was formed, it used a basic service management solution. “This 
was good from a help desk perspective in terms of logging tickets but didn’t 
give us a complete picture of the service,” says Keenan Phelan, vice president 
of global managed services. As it grew, ITO needed a more robust, end-to-end 
solution that would give service managers the visibility to manage all aspects 
of daily service governance, satisfy SLA and key performance indicator obli-
gations, and provide proactive guidance to clients.
In 2005, the organization chose an integrated service management solution 
to fulfill these requirements. Built on an information repository, the solu-
tion gives ITO ticketing and monitoring services that allow the team to react 
quickly to situations, as well as to govern and track information flow seam-
lessly to resolution. If a server goes down, for example, the system auto-
matically alerts the Technical Operations Network Operating Center, which 
evaluates the alert. If something has failed, the center creates an incident 
ticket and routes it to designated ITO personnel, the customer, or a third 
party for resolution.
Troubleshooting
The integrated system also helps ITO troubleshoot and restore service as 
quickly as possible without affecting users. Recurring or major incidents are 
graduated to the problem management stage, at which staff members identify 
the root cause of the failure, whether it’s a process, technology, or person-
nel. If a change is necessary, the problem rolls into the change management 
function, where staffers can make modifications and restore service. Along 

269
 Chapter 24: Service Provider
the way, Phelan says, “The system allows CIBER to react to the situation and 
govern communication to both end users and internal client IT contacts.”
Reporting
ITO uses the reports that the system generates about SLA metrics, such as 
reaction times to calls, response times to resolve issues, and information on 
infrastructure health to take a more proactive approach to managing service. 
“Reviewing service-level agreements on a proactive basis with our customers 
helps to avoid problematic situations down the road . . . by addressing ques-
tions and issues that can become contentious before they become problems,” 
Phelan says.
Service managers use these reports, along with knowledge of new IT trends, 
to advise clients in quarterly business reviews. As an example, they might 
provide insight on the cost and reliability benefits of relocating systems to 
a CIBER data center or about using virtualization solutions to reduce an 
organization’s physical IT footprint. Says George Maroulakos, director of 
global service management, “Many times, the CIO of an organization will 
ask us to protect him from himself. . . . The strategic direction we provide 
improves the level and value of the service we offer and helps them protect 
themselves.”
Service-level agreements: 
Business versus technical
ITO has always used technical SLAs — such as response times and availabil-
ity levels — as measuring sticks for performance. CIBER, however, recently 
signed contracts with clients in the United Kingdom and United States to 
deliver jointly determined business SLAs. This type of SLA guarantees the 
outcome of a business process. A technical SLA might state that a system is 
up 99.9 percent of the time; the business SLA might state that the customer 
will get her report every day at 8 am. One SLA is technology-focused; the 
other is business-service-focused.
 
See Chapter 17 for a discussion of business service management.
ITO is finding that business SLAs can be double-edged swords. On the plus 
side, it can use the process of negotiating and fulfilling business SLA obliga-
tions to extend the client relationship beyond the IT organization and better 
understand client requirements. But business SLAs are more difficult for the 
service provider to craft and guarantee; they also carry more risk, because all 
the service levels that feed the business service must be met.

270
Part V: Real Life with Service Management 
“Although business SLAs may appear simpler on paper, they don’t simplify 
back-end requirements,” Phelan says. For a client, the business SLA require-
ment for e-mail is simple: Users need to be able to send and receive e-mail 
and perform messaging activities around the clock. To provide this service 
level, ITO must meet the same technical SLAs for availability, reliability, and 
performance that it normally would.
Measuring business SLAs
Because measuring a business SLA is more binary — the provider either does 
or doesn’t deliver on a single metric, rather than on a series of metrics — it’s 
also more subjective. Notes Maroulakos, “You can look at a particular server 
or storage unit and say it was up or down; here’s the data to prove it. But if, 
from a business perspective, a single user or a handful of users claim they 
can’t use the service, how do you prove or disprove that?”
Furthermore, crafting penalties for a business SLA is much trickier. “In real-
ity, no penalty can ever reimburse the client for a loss of service to a business-
critical system, and for us, the potential damage to our reputation could be 
exponential,” says Phelan.
Mitigating potential issues
ITO takes a proactive, collaborative approach to mitigate potential issues. It 
works with clients to develop precise SLAs that detail different levels of pen-
alties and risk assignment. In the e-mail example from earlier in this chapter, 
for example, the client needs to give CIBER a wide range of authority; there 
is very little room for dependencies on internal IT or third parties. “If you’re 
going to hold me responsible, you have to give me the authority to control 
the environment,” Phelan says.
Even when the customer grants this authority, ITO still can’t control every-
thing. It can host the system in its data centers and control the network, 
server platforms, and software changes. It can hold dual contracts with car-
riers for redundancy, and it can control administration and management 
rights. But it can’t control carrier failures or random acts of nature or man 
that could bring a system down.
Some customers also find it difficult to grasp the cost implications associ-
ated with guaranteeing higher levels of business service. “Sometimes a 
client starts off insisting on hyperavailability. But I can guarantee that they 
won’t buy it, because when the CFO sees that if they accept three or four 
more hours of downtime, they can cut capital costs by up to 50 percent,” 
Phelan says.
Although just a few customers have requested business SLAs to date, ITO 
sees increasing interest, particularly in industries such as retail, in which 

271
 Chapter 24: Service Provider
companies already use IT outsourcing extensively. In addition, Phelan 
says, “European countries have shown more interest — probably because 
they tend to be ahead of U.S. companies in ITIL [Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library; see Chapter 5] adoption and take a more disciplined 
approach.” But, he adds, “If we were actively marketing it, a lot of U.S. clients 
would probably find it really interesting.” Before it does this, however, ITO 
wants to make sure that it gets the details and processes right.
Lessons learned and best practices
Through years of managing IT infrastructure for its clients, ITO has devel-
oped many insights about implementing an effective service management 
strategy. Some of its top guidelines follow:
 
✓ Service management systems aren’t cure-alls. Companies “can’t take an 
environment that doesn’t function well and put in a new systems man-
agement solution and suddenly make it function well,” Phelan says. “You 
need to also resolve underlying architectural issues first.”
 
✓ Reality-check the cost of availability. Each 9 after the decimal point in 
99.999 percent availability costs exponentially more than the preceding 
one. Take a pragmatic approach, and determine the point of diminishing 
returns.
 
✓ Internal issues don’t solve themselves. If you’re planning to outsource 
infrastructure and service management, remember that internal opera-
tional issues won’t automatically go away when you outsource. Work 
with the outsourcer up-front to identify architectural problems and 
address them before you hand off daily management.
 
✓ Implement measurable technical SLAs before moving to business 
SLAs. If you haven’t yet established an SLA culture, it will be difficult to 
go directly to the more subjective business SLA right out the gate.

W

you some tips to consider as you make your way through 
service management. Because we’re so nice, we also list 
some resources that you may find useful.

Ten Service Management 
Dos and Don’ts
In This Chapter
▶ Balancing business objectives with service performance
▶ Understanding business processes
▶ Recognizing the importance of standards
▶ Choosing the right starting point
T
his chapter carves out a few dos and don’ts. We want you to benefit from 
the mistakes of other people — including us.
Do Remember Business Objectives
If you want to deliver high-quality service, you need to satisfy your custom-
ers’ expectations. Sometimes, these expectations conflict with the policies 
and performance objectives of your business. Service management must find 
the right balance between optimizing performance/service delivery and meet-
ing business objectives.
Service management needs to account for both customer satisfaction and 
business stakeholder requirements. You may spend too much money making 
customers very happy and lose money in the process, for example, so cus-
tomer satisfaction needs to be balanced against costs to the company.

276
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Stop Optimizing 
after a Single Process
IT service management requires continuous process improvement. Although 
improving a single process may be satisfying, it won’t be enough. You have to 
look at the overall processes that make the business operate efficiently.
Do Remember Business Processes
You have to understand the processes for all things IT, from application 
management, system management, and performance management to service 
desk, network management, and database management. When you know how 
to optimize service delivery, you can take a proactive approach to service 
management, such as analyzing and documenting workflows, optimizing per-
formance, and conforming to regulatory requirements.
Do Plan for Cultural Change
What is your corporate culture? How well do employees adapt to changes in 
everything from new technology to new processes? It’s common for employ-
ees to want to keep doing things the old-fashioned way. If you’re going to 
change the way your IT organization works, however, you have to change the 
way people think about their jobs.
Cultural change is an important part of creating a businesscentric approach 
to service management. Your IT team needs to work together in a new way if 
you want to move from fighting the latest fire to donning fire-retardant paja-
mas. The responsibilities and roles for your IT service providers probably 
will change; clarify expectations at the beginning of your change process. 
You should be able to redefine your service-level agreements and get better 
at responding to business priorities. If the members of your IT team measure 
their performance by the number of crises they solve, they need to redefine 
the way they look at their jobs.
Don’t Neglect Governance
IT governance is a combination of policy, process, controls, a stash of a 
consistent source of data about IT services, and the means to control those 

277
 Chapter 25: Ten Service Management Dos and Don’ts
services — and it isn’t easy to achieve. You must balance your focus on the 
key performance indicators of the business with performance of all IT compo-
nents. IT governance is successful only if you align it with overall corporate 
governance requirements. Think about how you’re going to get from where 
you are now to a well-coordinated approach that fits your corporate goals 
and objectives. This topic is an important one, so we refer you to Chapter 10 
for more details on governance.
Do Keep Security in Mind
With all those services to manage, don’t lose sight of who gets access to 
what. Concern yourself with the security of data, hardware, software, and 
physical assets. The convergence of physical security with the security of 
IT systems (fingerprint identity and electronic passcodes) is becoming an 
important part of comprehensive service management. We provide a lot 
more details on security in Chapter 16.
Don’t Try to Manage Services without 
Standardization and Automation
You have a lot of smart people on your IT team. But if you have a lot of infra-
structure components — and we expect that you do — no single person will 
know everything about all your servers or applications. The person who 
knows how to solve complicated service requests may leave the company 
someday. Improve standardization and automate processes to create a 
repeatable way to get the job done right.
Do Remember Industry Standards 
and Best Practices
Don’t assume your requirements are so unique that you can’t benefit from 
looking at established standards and best practices. Following best practices 
that other companies have successfully implemented will help you imple-
ment your service strategy faster.
Education is a good first step for your business. Send your team members 
to become certified in Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 
practices, which we cover in Chapter 5. Study best-practices models that 

278
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
have been designed for your industry. Chapters 4 and 5 provide a lot more 
information on standards and best practices, and Chapter 26 tells you where 
to find some great resources on these standards.
Do Start with a Visible Project
Make sure that your initial service management project is well defined and 
well confined. Go for the biggest bang for the buck. Initially, try something 
visible, such as a service catalog that documents information about IT ser-
vices. Many organizations begin by implementing a service desk that helps 
focus on solving immediate problems. Prove your success with a project 
that’s achievable in a short time, with a significant effect on the business; 
then build incrementally.
Don’t Postpone Service Management
Service management is a journey, and the sooner you begin, the sooner you’ll 
get somewhere. Service management requires paying constant attention and 
balancing business priorities with available resources. A finely tuned and 
responsive IT service management approach drives business value.
