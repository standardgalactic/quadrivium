About the Author
Rob Snell loves e-commerce and all things Yahoo! Store. He is totally
obsessed with search marketing and increasing his stores’ conversion rates.
He is a small-business owner, online retailer, search marketing/e-commerce
consultant, Yahoo! Store developer, sometime bass player, and Steve Snell’s
brother and business partner. This is his first book!
Rob has been in retail literally longer than he can remember. Growing up in
the family mail-order catalog and retail business meant summers and week-
ends of unloading truckloads of 50-lb. bags of dog food, waiting on customers,
designing catalogs and magazine ads, and even programming the point-of-sale
systems. He was shocked when his sister-in-law informed him that most other
families didn’t talk about search marketing or conversion rates over
Thanksgiving dinner.
Rob has been into computers since 1981 when his mom bought him a Timex
Sinclair ZX81. He’s been online since 1990 and opened his first online store in
1997 when his brother stumbled across Viaweb (now Yahoo! Store). Since
then, Rob has designed, developed, owned, and/or marketed hundreds and
hundreds of Yahoo! Stores that have sold millions and millions of dollars
worth of stuff. Rob has sold Superman comics, art supplies, Pokémon cards,
refurbished Sun workstations, pewter dragons, dog supplies, car-top carriers,
softball equipment, and even janitorial supplies.
Rob has a lot of experience as a small-business owner in many different
fields. He started freelancing as a graphic design student and was booking
and playing bass in several bands in college when he and his brother started
a small chain of five comic book stores (which they sold in 2001). Rob spends
his workdays helping his clients sell more stuff on the Internet and working
with his family.
Rob now consults with retailers on improving their e-commerce sites and
maximizing their search-marketing campaigns and is a guest speaker and lec-
turer on search marketing and e-commerce for small businesses. He posts
somewhat regularly in his Yahoo! Store blog at www.ystore.blogs.com and
can be contacted via e-mail at book@ystore.com. For more information,

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of my father, W.C. Snell, who always
believed in me even though he almost never agreed with me.

Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
T
hanks for taking a look at Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies. When
the folks from Wiley Press approached me about writing this book, I think
I may have come off as more than just a little cocky. I boldly asserted, “I am
the guy to write this book.” Why? I’ve lived Yahoo! Store since April 1997. I’m
not saying I know more about Yahoo! Store than anyone else, but I do have as
broad an experience with the platform as anyone I’ve ever met.
Around these parts, our Yahoo! Stores make the mortgage payments and then
some, so we pay pretty close attention to what increases sales. Working with
300-plus retailers has opened my eyes to the myriad ways we all sell online
using the same exact platform. I learn something new from every retailer I
work with.
Also, I think I’ve worn almost every hat you can wear in the Yahoo! Store uni-
verse as both a retailer and an online store developer and marketer. I’ve been
a new store owner, neophyte online store builder, entry-level HTML coder,
graphic designer, product photographer, box packer, telephone order taker,
shipping manager, e-mail marketer, customer service phone rep, RTML
hacker, search engine optimizer, and sales copywriter.
I’ve also tried tons of different ways to sell online. Some have worked. Others
haven’t. Look, I’m not embarrassed to say I’ve made lots and lots of mistakes
trying to stay on top of Internet marketing. Learn from them! If I’m still doing
something today, it’s because it works! I’ve had some home runs with sites
that have made some of my clients rich (and me fat and happy), generating
millions and millions of dollars in sales.
After nine years, I’ve found that it just takes a good idea, a little bit of luck,
and lots and lots of good ol’ hard work to be successful online. The better
your idea and the better your luck, the more successful you’ll be, but it really
just comes down to who wants it bad enough. Opportunity shows up in work
clothes. In this book, I give you the tools and show you the path that worked
for me, but you have to do the heavy lifting.

About This Book
This book is filled with more than nine years of proven Internet marketing
strategies and tactics sprinkled with online success stories and hard-learned
lessons from Yahoo! Store owners who have successfully competed with the
big online players. This book is paying a debt to all the retailers and other folks
who shared information that helped me stay alive long enough to figure out
what I was doing. I expect you to pass this knowledge on to future retailers.
This book is what I wish I knew in April 1997. Anybody got a time machine?
In this book, you find answers to questions about:
 Creating an online store that sells
 Driving more traffic that converts into sales
 Profiting from keywords
 Processing credit cards online and offline
 Finding out what’s really selling online
 Maximizing sales on an existing store
What You’re Not to Read
This book is about store building with the Yahoo! Store Editor, which has
been around in some form or another for more than ten years. I don’t tell you
how to build stores with Store Tags, the other way to build Yahoo! Stores,
which I loathe. If you must build a store with Store Tags because your prod-
uct catalog never changes, or if you want to use SiteBuilder, take this book
back to the store and get your money back because about half of this book
doesn’t apply to you. On second thought, I get paid in royalties based upon
sales, so, uh, keep this book and profit from all the marketing stuff in here.
Store Tags users probably need Site Builder For Dummies (Wiley Publishing,
Inc.) by Richard Wagner (or the specific For Dummies book for whatever soft-
ware title you’re using for store building). Every store owner can benefit from
Yahoo!’s free Merchant Solutions Getting Started Guide, which is available on
the Web at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/guides/index.
html for you to download and print.
This book is also not revealing any of my trade secrets or those of my clients.
I’m not giving away the store here (pun intended). All the examples and
screen shots have had specific store information removed, or I’ve been vague
enough to protect client info. This book is also not about how to get rich
quick; it’s about how to get rich slowly. It’s also not how to game the search
engines for free traffic (which would make you a spammer).

Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I’ve made a few assumptions about you:
 You have a computer (a Mac or PC) and have basic computer skills.
 You’re connected to the Internet with a high-speed connection.
 You either are a retailer or want to be a retailer.
 You want to know how to sell (more) stuff online.
 You’re tired of working for The Man.
 You’re not a communist, and you want to make some money.
This book is written for the independent business owner who feels pretty
comfortable with computers. You can handle sending and receiving e-mail
with attachments and are comfortable with software like Microsoft Excel,
Microsoft Word, and QuickBooks. Some knowledge of graphics software (like
Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro) is extremely helpful for editing product
photos and creating store graphics, but it’s not required.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six parts. I describe these parts in the following
sections.
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store
Discover the basic geography of Yahoo! Store: the Store Editor, the Store
Manager, and the published site. Find out about the different ways folks make
money online. You also see how to find out what products are really selling
and how you can save some time with a few simple tweaks to your Editor.
Finally, it’s almost like an episode of CSI where I dissect a real Yahoo! Store
order from start to finish, examining every gory detail to determine the real
cause of conversion.
Part II: Planning What’s in Store
Preparing to build and design your online store is almost half the battle. In
this part, you find out about doing the work yourself or outsourcing it to
designers. I explore assembling the different elements before you start to
build your store, designing your store to turn shoppers into buyers, creating
effective internal store navigation, and using images to sell more product.
3
Introduction

Part III: Building and 
Managing Your Store
This part tells you how the Editor works and shows you how to format your
store with navigation buttons. You also discover how to create different types
of pages: sections, items, the home page, search pages, and shipping info and
contact information pages. You can read about how to sell more of the prod-
ucts you have by merchandising your store more effectively. I also check out
the Shopping Cart and the new Checkout Manager. Finally, I cover the Store
Manager, where you set all your tax and shipping calculations and process
orders.
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing
This part is my favorite. You need to be found when folks are looking to buy
what you are selling. I cover keywords and introduce the basics of Internet
marketing. You also find out about the specifics of paid search (Google
AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing) as well as how to drive free traffic from
search engines by optimizing your Yahoo! Store for Google, Yahoo! and MSN.
Part V: Making More Money 
with Your Yahoo! Store
This is my other favorite part of the book. After you have a store up and run-
ning, you’ve done the hard part: getting started. Improving an existing store
is so much easier than launching a new store. In this part, you discover how
to improve your store (based upon your stats), convert more of your existing
traffic into buyers, e-mail your customer list to sell more stuff, and save time
and energy by uploading products by the dozens.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
I love The Part of Tens. These chapters cover Yahoo! Store tools, add-ons,
and upgrades. You also find out a little about RTML, the proprietary custom
scripting language of Yahoo! Store.

Icons Used in This book
Look for these helpful icons to highlight specific points I think you should
know about:
I’m all about giving folks action items or takeaways. When you see the Tip
icon, you know that I’m sharing with you a way to improve your store or save
time.
When you see the Remember icon, I’m reminding you that you need to know
this bit of Yahoo! Store trivia for something to work.
I’m pretty careful to not be an alarmist, so when you see the Warning icon,
don’t think CNN scroll hype, think, “Danger, Will Robinson” because you’re
very close to something that could do you real harm — like a man-eating
carrot (remember that episode?).
This icon highlights all the technical details that you don’t really have to
know to operate a Yahoo! Store, but you may want to know if you’re a guru. If
you’re not interested, skip the text marked with this icon.
Where to Go from Here
Unlike a novel, you can read this book in any order. You can even skip parts,
chapters, or entire sections within chapters, and you’ll be okay. Skip to the
end of the book and read about conversion rate, and then back to the part
where I introduce the Store Editor, and then over to the design chapter, and
you’ll be fine. You don’t even have to read the whole book. Use the Index and
the Table of Contents to find what you want to read about and read only that
information.
Running a Yahoo! Store isn’t that difficult, but there are so many things you
need to always be working on. The good news is that you don’t have to mem-
orize all of this stuff. Refer back to this book as often as you like.

I need your feedback. Please e-mail me at book@ystore.com. It’s really help-
ful for me to know what works and what doesn’t. If you catch a mistake, let
me know, and I’ll correct it. Visit www.YstoreBooks.com, which will have
additional information I wanted to include in the book, but couldn’t because
Editor Kelly wouldn’t let me have 600+ pages.
I also have a book-based newsletter, which you can subscribe to by e-mailing

Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies 

Part I
Finding Out about
Yahoo! Store

In this part . . .
Yahoo! Small Business, Yahoo! Merchant Solutions,
Yahoo! Search Marketing, Yahoo! Web Hosting,
and Yahoo! Store. Wow! Sometimes starting a business
on Yahoo! can be confusing, but don’t panic. I do this for
a living!
This part of the book gets you started building your
online business with Yahoo! and fast! (I have a short atten-
tion span.) First, I explain all things Yahoo!, like how all
these different parts work together. I also fess up and
finally come clean about why I still use Yahoo! Store after
all these years. (Because it works!) I also get you to plan
your online business and examine different business
models for selling stuff online. If you don’t already sell
something, I help you figure out what products to sell and
then make sure that you can make a living doing so.
I like to get things moving, too. Chapter 3 is where the real
action kicks in because I show you how to jump-start your
store. You quickly dive into the Store Editor, create some
sample sections and products, upload some images, and
publish. You also publish your order settings and place a
test order. Finally, I wrap this part of the book up and exam-
ine a real live Yahoo! Store order from beginning to end.
Yahoo! Small Business gives you the tools to build a suc-
cessful online business, but you have to take the initiative
and do the work. If you plan ahead, work hard, and take
care of your customers, with a little bit of luck, you can
build your online business and accomplish your goals and
dreams.

Chapter 1
The Nickel Tour of Yahoo! Store
In This Chapter
 Getting to know Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
 Retailing as a lifestyle business
 Opening a Yahoo! Small Business
“Hey, Momma? Know what? If I take all my old toys that I don’t play with
anymore and sell them, I can take all that money and buy some new toys!”
— Sam Snell (my nephew), sometime around age 3
I
’ve always wondered whether independent retailers are born or made. Is
self-employment nature or nurture? Maybe self-employment isn’t in the
blood as much as it is in the air. I grew up in my parents’ retailing business,
so I can see where I caught the bug, but not my parents. Their parents taught
school and sold insurance. I guess my folks saw opening their own store as
the easiest way to be their own boss, own their own business, and get their
piece of the American Dream.
This chapter is your introduction to all things Yahoo! Store. Thanks to its
suite of online store-building and -management tools, Yahoo! makes it easy
to start and run your own business. The Yahoo! Merchant Solutions service
includes domains, Web hosting, e-mail, and Yahoo! Store. This chapter also
provides you with an overview of the different parts of the Yahoo! universe,
showing the different pieces and parts of Yahoo! I also discuss what Yahoo!
Stores are, why I think Yahoo! Stores are swell, and the types of retailers who
sell on Yahoo!
Exploring Small Business
Small business is really big business. It’s an old story by now. The media have
been all over it for ten years or more. “Small” business owners (and we don’t
like the word small) are the dynamo that powers the American economy, 

creating 70 percent of all new jobs. More folks are starting up new businesses
than ever before, and the Internet makes becoming an entrepreneur easier
than ever.
Retailing is also big business in this country. It’s a very big percentage of our
GDP. Americans really like to buy stuff, but how we buy is changing all the
time. We’re buying more and more online every year. Brick-and-mortar retail-
ing is pretty saturated, getting overcrowded with big-box category killers sell-
ing everything from warehouse locations. Mom and Pop stores can’t compete
with the Wal-Marts on price or selection, so service is all you have when
you’re a little guy.
Retail customer service is pretty much dead. I’m really impressed if I get a
cashier who smiles and thanks me for my business. Finding someone with
real product knowledge who can answer my questions is whole ’nother trick.
I’ve just accepted the fact that I have to become an “expert” about whatever
I’m buying by doing my homework. There’s this wide range of service in retail
these days from virtually none (the big-box boys) to great service (high-end
boutiques and better independent retailers).
All this change and the vacuum of decent customer service and product
knowledge create a huge opportunity. If you have product expertise, are a
subject matter expert in your niche of the woods, and enjoy dealing with
folks like yourself, online retailing may be for you.
Get real for a minute. You’re probably not going to get rich selling online with
a Yahoo! Store. You certainly won’t make a killing overnight, but it’s a great
way to make a comfortable living. You get to be your own boss and have a
certain flexibility of schedule. Being able to work from anywhere (even at
home in your PJs) is a big, big plus. Small-business retailing is more of a
lifestyle business than a ticket for the IPO lottery. Retailing is an easy way
to start a business, and selling on the Internet is a perfect way to start. You
don’t need mountains of capital, just a strong desire and a little bit of sweat
equity, and you’re in business.
Introducing Yahoo! Small Business
When you open a Merchant Solutions account at Yahoo! Small Business, you
have a Yahoo! Store (which is what I call it, no matter what anyone else says).
Simply put, a Yahoo! Store is an online store hosted at Yahoo! — a Web store
with your own domain name. Your Web site comes with a Shopping Cart and
a secure checkout with a payment gateway. Plug in your merchant account (a
special bank account for processing credit cards), and you can accept credit-
card payments (and now PayPal payments). You also get tools to build and
10
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

manage your store. These tools include the Shipping Manager tool to config-
ure your store’s shipping methods and rates, a product database, online sales
and traffic reports, stats, and graphs to see how you’re doing. You also get
the Store Editor — a Web-design tool for store building. Yahoo! Store also has
really good customer support (both toll-free by phone and e-mail) and excel-
lent online help files.
Yahoo! Store is a great choice for building your online store. The platform has
more than 35,000 stores and has been around since 1996, before Yahoo! paid
$49 million for Viaweb in July 1998. There’s a success track to follow. Other
retailers have done well on Yahoo! Store, and maybe you can, too. Yahoo!
Store is also a recognized name brand for shoppers, so potential customers
feel more comfortable shopping with you.
Using Yahoo! Store also has secondary benefits: There’s a big enough Yahoo!
Store user base for a community to develop (www.ystoreforums.com).
There’s also a growing developer network of around 100-plus RTML guys 
and gals who specialize in designing and marketing Yahoo! Stores (http://
smallbusiness.yahoo.com/merchant/designdir.php). Lots of business
and design challenges have been met and overcome. There’s a clear path to
follow when building a Yahoo! Store, and many friendly folks are on the road
and don’t mind sharing tips and tricks with fellow Web retailers.
Okay. I’ll admit it. Yahoo! is a bit expensive compared to bargain-basement
Web-hosting and Shopping Cart software. Honestly, you’ll pay more for Web
hosting when you have a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions account, but I believe this
expense is actually a good thing because you really do get what you pay for.
Table 1-1 lists the different monthly hosting packages, where you either pay
$40, $100, or $300 a month plus a percentage of your sales. This revenue share
fee is 1.5 percent (ouch!), 1 percent, or 0.75 percent (depending on the type of
account you get), but because Yahoo! has resources other smaller companies
don’t, you shouldn’t mind sharing a little bit for what you get in return.

Chapter 1: The Nickel Tour of Yahoo! Store

For example, huge surges in traffic aren’t a problem when you have a Yahoo!
Store. Yahoo! has an incredible load-balancing infrastructure so that you
don’t have to worry, for example, if your store gets mentioned on Oprah and
10,000 people suddenly swarm your store. I really don’t understand all of this
propeller-head stuff, but I’ve seen stores handle tons of traffic (10,000 people
a day) and not crash. Yahoo! Stores can also handle the huge spikes in traffic,
for example, like the Christmas rush, where the entire Internet is swamped
with millions more shoppers than usual. If you have a very seasonal business
where you go from a 100 people a day in the off season to 4,000 people a day
in the peak season and 150 to 200 orders a day, Yahoo! Store may be for you.
Yahoo! is pretty serious about its Web-hosting business. It’s not a sideline or
an afterthought. Nowadays, anyone with a T1 line and a server can set up a
box and be a “Web-hosting company,” but sometimes it takes a $45 billion
market-cap company to do things right.
Yahoo! Stores have a great uptime record, too. One of the reasons I don’t
mind paying a little bit more for Yahoo! Store than generic Shopping Cart
Web-development packages or Web-hosting packages is that I’ve had a Yahoo!
Store or Viaweb since 1997. I know of only two times that our store was either
down or really, really slow. I can’t say that about any other product or service
that I’ve ever had, whether on the Web or not, including cell phones, air con-
ditioners, 1-800 numbers, bank accounts, Lexus convertibles, iBooks, and so
on. I’m not saying that Yahoo! Stores are bulletproof, but if someone is shoot-
ing at my online store, I would rather it be a Yahoo! Store than anything else.
Figuring Out Who Uses Yahoo! Store
Lots of different types of people use Yahoo! Store to sell all kinds of different
things online:
 Brick-and-mortar stores: These stores include anyone from Mom and Pop
retailers to large corporate clients who don’t want to spend $250,000 for a
custom e-commerce solution. These retailers supplement their brick-and-
mortar store’s income by double-dipping, with their inventory selling
online and offline. Sometimes the tail wags the dog and the real “store” is
simply a warehouse for the online store’s products.
 Stay-at-home moms (or dads): These mompreneurs build their business
by taking phone orders and packing boxes between changing diapers
and making trips to soccer practice. This new demographic is exploding
and, man, are these folks competitive! I had a huge base of mom-clients
until a crop of stay-at-home mom store developers popped up. These
Y!Moms had no overhead and rock-bottom store development prices
and grabbed all the business! I love it when the “breadwinning” spouse
has to quit his or her job to come home and help fill all these Yahoo!
Store orders.
12
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

 Nonprofits: I’ve seen everyone from church groups to museums to
social activists sell online to raise money or accept contributions. Even
the American Red Cross had a Yahoo! Store to take donations!
 Drop-shipping Web marketers: These retailers only drop-ship, which
means that they forward orders to a wholesale distributor who packs
and ships the order for the retailer. Drop-shipping means no inventory,
no warehouse, no killer overhead, and (sometimes) no employees. Drop-
shipping retailers probably pay more for their products than retailers
who stock and ship all their products, but drop-shippers have much less
risk than traditional retailers. If you can find a great wholesaler who is
also a drop-shipper, you can focus on customer service and Internet
marketing (see Chapter 2). I have some great examples, but my retail
clients would shoot me if I slipped and gave up their killer sources!
 Mail-order catalogers: These old-school, direct-mail retailers are embrac-
ing Internet marketing, and many catalog companies sell more through
their online catalog than through mailed, paper catalogs. Catalogs are
tremendously expensive to print and mail, especially compared to the
relative bargains of paid-search advertising (see Chapter 18) and free 
traffic from search engines (see Chapter 19).
 Inventors, authors, and musicians: When you write a book or invent a
product, no matter how cool it is, you can’t sell it if shoppers can’t buy it!
Sometimes the Big Boys either won’t carry a product or want big bucks
for catalog placement or space on store shelves. If you can create a 
virtual product where folks can download a file like a program (www.
rtmltemplates.com), an e-book (www.ytimes.info), or an MP3 file
(www.laugh.com), you don’t even have to ship anything!
Selling your own creation is probably the hardest road to Internet mar-
keting success, but if you hit a home run, you’re rich! When you sell the
products that you make, you usually have a killer margin because you
keep the manufacturer’s, distributor’s, and retailer’s share of the pie.
 Manufacturers: I’m a retailer who firmly believes that most manufactur-
ers shouldn’t retail! I believe it’s bad manners to compete with your
retailers for the very same customers, but some manufacturers want to
sell direct. It’s a free country! The best compromise I’ve seen is when the
manufacturer sells at full retail using its own manufacturer’s suggested
retail price (MSRP) and provides links to other approved online mer-
chants who are free to sell at market price. See www.mailcarts.com

Deciphering All the Parts
Your credit-card statement lists Yahoo! Small Business (YSB) as your online
landlord. Y!SB is the division at Yahoo! that you deal with the most.
13
Chapter 1: The Nickel Tour of Yahoo! Store

Here are the other parts of Yahoo! you need to know about:
 Yahoo! Search (www.yahoo.com) is a separate part of Yahoo!. Just
because you have a Yahoo! Store doesn’t mean that your store will auto-
matically rank in the top ten results at Yahoo.com when folks search for
keywords related to what you sell. Yahoo! doesn’t play favorites with
stores or hosted sites, which is confusing to some new accounts. See
Chapter 19 for tips on optimizing your store for all the search engines,
especially the top three that drive 95 percent of Internet search engine
traffic: Google, Yahoo!, and MSN Search.
 Yahoo! Shopping is Yahoo!’s shopping portal and the public face of
Yahoo! Search. To be listed in Y!Shopping, you have to organize and
submit your products to Yahoo! Product Submit. If accepted, your prod-
ucts get sucked into the Yahoo! Product Search database, showing up
when customers search on http://shopping.yahoo.com. You pay
for each click from Y!Shopping to your store based upon your industry
(anywhere from 15 cents to $1). Yahoo! Merchant Solutions accounts
do get 20 percent off list prices, though. See http://productsubmit.
adcentral.yahoo.com/sspi/us/pricing to read about Yahoo!
Shopping and other ways to market your store in Chapter 17.
 Yahoo! Search Marketing (YSM) is the paid-search advertising part of
Yahoo!. You know what I’m talking about — those sponsored ads that
appear at the top and to the right on Yahoo! and lots of other sites. See
Chapter 18 on buying your way to the top with paid-search ads on
Yahoo! (and its competitor, Google AdWords).
Examining Merchant Solutions
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions is the catchall marketing name for Yahoo! Small
Business division’s services package, which includes domains, business
e-mail, Web hosting, and Store. Domains lets you register and reserve your
domain name and control where it points on the Web. Yahoo! Business E-mail
gives you 100 mailboxes with spam control and 17 other things e-mail does.
Yahoo! Web hosting gives you traditional Web-hosting space where you can
upload your files via FTP or the File Manager with 20GB of disk space. You
also get 500GB data transfer, PHP support, log files, and more.
The “Store” part of Merchant Solutions is what used to be called Yahoo! Store
and consists of the Store Manager and Store Editor. You can also use two
completely different ways — Store Editor or Store Tags — to build and main-
tain your store. The store-building part of this book is about Store Editor.
See Chapter 5 for more on why I use the Store Editor, and why I think you
should, too.
14
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

The Store Manager is your virtual back office. You can process orders
(review, edit, and export store orders), view Statistics (all the cool reports,
graphs, and statistics to help you manage your business), configure Order
Settings (Shipping Manager, tax settings, payment methods), maintain Site
Settings, and promote your online store. You can read more about the Store
Manager in Chapter 15.
The Store Editor is both an online store builder and a product database man-
ager. You can create, edit, and organize your products on the Web by brows-
ing a copy of your online store. Here you can also design, tweak, and update
your store’s look and feel and see your design changes behind the scenes.
When everything’s perfect in the Editor version of your store, click the
Publish button to update the public version of your store. Use the built-in
product and section page templates and customize your store by editing the
look and feel settings on the global Variables page. Advanced users (or pro-
fessional store developers, if you have the budget) can create a unique look
by editing copies of RTML templates or by creating custom RTML templates
from scratch. See Chapter 26 for more on RTML, the proprietary templating
language and foundation of Yahoo! Store.

Chapter 1: The Nickel Tour of Yahoo! Store
I still use Yahoo! Store and Store Editor 
today because they work
The reason I chose Viaweb (now Yahoo! Store
Editor) to build my first online store back in early
1997 was because I wanted to sell stuff on the
Internet, not code HTML or learn how to pro-
gram CGI-BIN shopping cart scripts. I’m a
retailer and a marketer, not a computer scien-
tist! I had many reasons for choosing Viaweb:
 Viaweb worked for me because I could 
do it myself. Back in 1997, I literally had 
no Web store development budget, so I
couldn’t pay a Web developer what, at the
time, was the outrageous price of $75 an
hour to set up an online shopping cart. I was
also highly motivated with the desperation
that only comes from your momma saying,
“Son, get my business online, and do it fast,
or there won’t be any business pretty soon.
PetSmart is coming. . . .” One thing I did
have was oodles of free time, thanks to my
business partner (and baby brother), Steve,
who runs our day-to-day operations so well
that I can disappear into a project (like this
book!) for six months to a year when an
opportunity presents itself!
 Viaweb/Yahoo! Store was perfect for me
because I also had no Web skills and vir-
tually no online experience. I had never
“developed” a Web site. I was a newbie to
the WWW in every sense of the word, play-
ing on CompuServe since 1990 and posting
in a few online comic book retailer forums
swapping marketing tips. I did have a back-
ground in retailing and had owned my
stores since I was in college. I also had my
degree in graphic design from Mississippi
State, but that was with tools from the
Stone Age designing things on paper.
(continued)

16
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 
 Viaweb also didn’t require me to have any
special software (that I really couldn’t
afford, anyway). I could build my store
online in the Store Editor (over a 28.8
modem dialup connection). All I had to do
was copy and paste some product informa-
tion, upload some pictures, tweak a few
Variables, and I was online selling stuff,
even though I had to learn store design and
Internet marketing fast and in public in front
of our customers!
The reason I still use Yahoo! Store today is
because it works. I have yet to find a better way
to sell online, and believe me when I say I’m
always looking! To me, Yahoo! Store is the
world’s best online store-building platform. It’s
perfect for little guys who want to become big
guys. You don’t have to be a Web developer or
even have an IT guy on staff. You build your
store and then concentrate on building your
business by taking care of your customers and
selling stuff. Yahoo! takes care of all the pro-
peller-head stuff behind the scenes.
Yahoo! Store can also scale with you as you
grow. Power users can always tap into the awe-
some power of customizing store pages through
RTML templates (see Chapter 26), as well as
automating some order-processing functionality
(see Chapter 15). Honestly, the only reason I
ever learned custom programming with RTML
was to be able to make search-engine-friendly
changes to the templates (to get more traffic)
and to make design changes to the store to
improve sales (for example, moving my Add To
Cart button higher on the page).
Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris (the RTM of
RTML) did it right the first time with the Viaweb
Store Builder software. The Store Editor has
stood the test of time. The Editor I used in 1997
to build my first Viaweb store is remarkably sim-
ilar to the Yahoo! Store Editor we use today. You
get to see how your store looks in real time as
you add products or make changes to the global
Variables.
Back then, there weren’t any WYSIWYG (what
you see is what you get) HTML editors like
today’s Dreamweaver or FrontPage. Back then,
you wrote your HTML code and then had to look
in your browser to see what a page really
looked like. I’ve been using the Editor for over
eight years, which is an eternity on the Internet.
Maybe this old dinosaur is stuck in his ways, but
I love Store Editor and all things Yahoo! Store.

Small Business
In This Chapter

 Looking at the different kinds of issues facing all kinds of retailers
T
here are riches in niches, whether with popular products, products with
limited distribution, or items that tend to generate repeat orders. In this
chapter, I show you how to pick an online business model and how to do
product research to discover which products sell on the Web. I also take a
look at the different types of retailers starting a Yahoo! Store and cover
brand-new retail startups, folks taking an existing business online, retailers
migrating to Yahoo! Store from another platform, and existing Yahoo! Store
owners opening multiple stores.
Choosing a Business Model 
That Works on the Web
Retailers on the Web have to have a different business model than traditional,
real-world merchants. A business model is just a fancy name for the way a
company actually makes money. What strategy works offline is probably not
going to work online, which can make things complicated for folks who do
business in both worlds. Locally, you may have no real competition within
your trading area, but online you’ll have a ton of competition. Your competi-
tors are only a mouse click away, so you must be different. Differentiate your
store’s products from every other store selling the same things. I tell you how
to do that in this chapter.
Selling online gives the little guy a fighting chance against the big category
killers because smaller retailers are more nimble. When you’re small, you
don’t need approval from marketing, legal, and IT to make a change on the

Web store; you just do it. The little guys can leverage their expertise, product
knowledge, and enthusiasm, and provide a better shopping experience in many
retail categories. On the Internet, you’re not limited by your how many stores
you have, your store’s physical location, normal business hours, the size of
your showroom, how much inventory you have, or the size of your staff. You’re
limited only by your creativity, your vision, your passion, and your work ethic.
Effective online retail business models remind me of cool retail shops I see in
large metropolitan areas. These retailers tend to focus on these tight little
niches that are big enough to make a comfortable living from but small
enough to avoid the large discounters. For example, last year I was playing
hooky wandering around in New York City. Instead of going to seminar pre-
sentations, I went shopping and found several cool, geeky stores that I loved.
These retailers could only make it in the big, big city and/or by selling online
or by mail order: Toy Tokyo (selling the coolest imported Japanese toys! See
ToyToyko.com), St. Mark’s Comics (selling every new comic book title pub-
lished every week), and Forbidden Planet (selling tons of books, graphic
novels, Japanese toys, and science fiction I couldn’t find anywhere else).
In a large market, you have the advantage of being able to focus on one micro
niche and be the expert in your subject area. The Internet is the largest market
there is. Your Yahoo! Store gives you a shot at the millions of people shopping
online every day, but only if you do something more than republish a copy of
your suppliers’ wholesale catalog. You have to do something to stand out from
hundreds or thousands of potential competitors.
Here’s a simple way to pick a business model: “Price, service, selection. Pick
any two out of three.” Another good one is “Do you want it good or fast or
cheap? You can have it good and cheap, but it’ll take forever. You can have it
good and fast, but you’ll pay a lot more. And you can have it fast and cheap,
but it’s not gonna be any good.”
Your business model can be to lose money on the first sale just to acquire a
customer and then make a profit on subsequent sales. Another model is to
sell expensive items as cheap as you can and then make all your profit selling
accessories, supplies, or extended warranties.
Another online business model is to use your industry contacts to bird-dog
good deals. Some retailers have sweetheart deals with manufacturers and
buy unsold inventory at rock-bottom prices, which allows them to have
seemingly unbeatable prices. I know several apparel retailers who buy unsold
stock from other boutiques for pennies on the dollar and then resell it online.
For example, my mom’s brick-and-mortar store, The Dog Store, had a pretty
simple business model based on service and selection. She sold a wide variety
of premium pet food at competitive prices, gave great customer service, and
had a very knowledgeable sales staff who could answer pet-care and -training
questions. She built up a large base of repeat customers and sold them other
products for training and taking care of their pets. When she opened her
18
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Yahoo! Store in 1997, her business model radically changed. Mom couldn’t
offer pet food as a draw because (as dot-bomb poster child Pets.com discov-
ered) you can’t ship 40-pound bags of premium dog food and make any
money, so she spent a lot more time on educating potential customers about
pet-training supplies and equipment. Instead of doing this education in
person, she made informative Web pages, personally replied to thousands of
e-mail questions, and gave great customer service over the telephone.
You want to be the place to buy what you sell online, so focus on a niche. Be a
cool, online boutique with a full selection and more product information than
anywhere else. Don’t sell 50,000 products. Don’t be a general store. The old
chestnut “You can’t be everything to everyone” is not just a cliché.
Copy what works. Believe me. Someone has already figured out how to sell
products online and make a buck. These retailers are the guys who under-
stood that you have to make a profit and are still in business after the dot-
com bubble burst. These successful retailers have already done the work.
Copy what they’re doing right, add your own personal spin on retailing, and
you have a much greater chance of online success.
Picking Products That Sell on the Web
Picking what products to sell is tough. Most everyone I know started out sell-
ing one thing and ended up selling something else because they discovered a
better opportunity. Your customers will tell you what to sell by what they buy
or what they ask for that you don’t carry. If someone can sell it through a cat-
alog, you can sell it with a Yahoo! Store. Most people in America live in or
near cities with pretty good access to shopping. If you sell the same stuff
people can get down the street, you’re simply offering convenience. You
don’t want to sell things that people can buy just anywhere unless you can
beat everyone on price.
Finding popular and profitable niches
You need to sell a product that’s popular enough so that you can make a
living, and that’s a lot easier to do when you make a decent profit on each
sale. I would bet that every type of product that can possibly be sold on the
Internet is being sold at this very moment.
Here’s how to see what’s selling on the Internet:
 Look at the most successful retailers in your niche. Check up on your
future competitors. Usually stores will publicize their bestsellers in their
Web store.
19
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

 Visit the shopping search engines. Look at Froogle.com, Bizrate.com,
Yahoo! Shopping, and Shopping.com for their top sellers.
 Look at Yahoo! Shopping Searches. In your Yahoo! Store Manager, click
the Shopping Searches link to see the past week’s top 100 searches in
Yahoo! Shopping. (Merchant Starter accounts don’t get Shopping
Searches, so you should upgrade.) Shopping Searches is a great way
to see what folks are looking to buy. What’s most popular on Yahoo!
Shopping changes with the seasons. By the time a seasonal product is
hot on Yahoo! Shopping, it’s probably too late to cash in, but there’s
always next year.
 Read the Shopping.com Consumer Demand Index at www.shopping.
com/cdi. This weekly report is also available in an e-mail newsletter.
The folks at Shopping.com want you to know what retail lines are hot,
and they want you to advertise your products with them.
 See what’s selling now at Yahoo! Shopping. Visit http://search.
store.yahoo.com/OT, and you see a sample of ten actual items that
sold in the last hour at Yahoo! Shopping.
 Look at completed auctions on eBay to see what’s really selling. Go to
www.ebay.com and click the Advanced Search link, which takes you to
the Search: Find Items page. Select the Completed Listings Only check
box and then search for a product. The search results list only com-
pleted items.
 Check out Terapeak.com. This site offers even more information, with
marketplace research on what products and categories are selling on
eBay. Even though selling with auctions and selling through an online
storefront are different, you can see some very interesting trends. For
$16.95 a month, you can see what categories are hot, what specific types
of products are having successful auctions, and what categories have
unmet demand.
 Research the highly popular keywords on eBay. Go to http://buy.
ebay.com, and you see hundreds of popular e-commerce keywords —
from Acura Integra to Zippo lighters and everything in between.
 Explore keyword tools like the Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly
Overture) Search Suggestion Tool, Wordtracker, and the Google
Keyword Sandbox. See Chapter 16 for lots more information about key-
words. See which keywords are more popular (volume of searches) and
which products are possibly more profitable based upon what advertisers
are bidding because retailers don’t bid for long on unprofitable keywords.
 Look at Wordtracker.com’s two Top 1,000 Keyword lists. The long-term
list reveals the most popular searches in the past eight weeks, and the
short-term list shows the top 1,000 keywords in the past 36 hours. While
most of these searches aren’t exactly related to e-commerce, you can get
some good ideas. Wordtracker is a paid service (around $200 a year),
but you can sign up at www.wordtracker.com/topkeywords.html
for free weekly e-mails with the Top 500 most popular keywords.

 Ask your government what’s selling. Get the latest updates from the U.S.
Census Department at www.census.gov/eos/www/ebusiness614.
htm and see your tax dollars at work. Table 2-1 shows what’s selling by line
of merchandise in the e-commerce economy, according to the U.S. Census
Department. You can easily find a ton of free information on e-commerce
all over the Web by doing a search for site:gov e-commerce on Google
or Yahoo!.

Look: You don’t need to be the only store online selling what you sell. Selling
on the Internet is like fishing in the ocean. There are enough fish out there for
a lot of folks. You don’t have to catch all the fish; you just need enough to
feed you and yours.
I encourage clients who have been selling for awhile to “cream their line” or to
focus on an existing niche within their product category that either does well
or has potential. For example, I had a jeweler client who originally wanted to
21
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

be a big online jewelry store and sell everything he sold in his real store in his
Yahoo! Store. I looked at his product line and did a little keyword research.
We found a great little niche (and no, I’m not telling). This particular niche was
a popular subcategory in the jewelry keyword universe. When we did our key-
word research for these specific types of products, we found that there were
enough keyword searches on a daily basis that if he got only 1 percent of the
Internet business for this particular niche, he would do extremely well.
My jeweler client did very well because he focused on his bestselling prod-
ucts. They were in the right price range of things that sell online, which in my
experience has been anything priced up to $250. He also had great margins
on these products. Also, he was somewhat protected from future competitors
because the manufacturer wasn’t looking for any new dealers. To sell its
product line, you had to be a real jewelry store, but the manufacturer didn’t
care if you also sold online. Because the jeweler already had a relationship
with the vendor, he was easily able to get databases and product photos. (See
Chapter 8 for more info on perfecting product pictures.) He is selling lots of
jewelry online and loves being a niche retailer. I told him it would work!
Promoting products with 
limited distribution
The last thing that you want to do is sell something that anyone else can sell
online because too many retailers selling the same thing can totally saturate
the market, drive down selling prices, and exponentially increase the cost of
paid-search advertising. Sell products with lots of barriers to entry, or factors
that make it difficult or expensive for new competitors to sell what you sell.
Barriers to entry can include exclusive marketing relationships, high initial
orders, high minimum purchases, requirement of a physical store, geographic
distribution restrictions, and minimum advertised pricing.
Barriers to entry are a double-edged sword. When you’re a new retailer, you
want to be able to open an account with a wholesaler, but after you’re in, you
don’t want your suppliers to sell to your future competitors.
Here are a few points to keep in mind when promoting products with limited
distribution:
 Certain suppliers will only sell to “legitimate” retailers with proof of a
physical location to protect their dealers from Internet-only competi-
tion. Selling out of a dorm room or basement is much cheaper than
paying the overhead of a real store, and these dealers can undercut
retailers who are paying for premium retail locations. Traditional stores
have big bucks tied up in inventory and usually have high overhead with
22
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

expensive employee payrolls, as well as infrastructure and administra-
tive expenses. The manufacturers try to protect the companies who
butter their bread because these dealers tend to carry the full line of
products, order in larger quantities, and are usually more stable than
dot-com startups. When you present yourself to these suppliers, you
need to look as legitimate as you can.
 Make sure that you have permission to sell online. Some manufactur-
ers and distributors don’t allow their dealers to sell online, or they have
Internet retailer restrictions. If retailers with a brick-and-mortar store get
caught selling products online, they get cut off. Sometimes this rule cre-
ates a gray market because retailers can set up another company or sell
through another retailer online, but folks going this route usually get
caught.
 Be certain that you can meet the minimum order or monthly volume.
Some distributors or wholesalers use sales volume to determine what
discount retailers get. They don’t want a lot of small dealers, but instead
prefer fewer accounts who are really serious about selling their prod-
ucts. Look for wholesalers who offer a stair-step discount structure that
seems to reward and protect their bigger retailers, because that’s where
you want to be one day.
 Minimum advertising pricing (MAP) is a way manufacturers protect
their offline retailers from heavy Internet competition. With MAP, you
can sell products for any price you want (because it would be price
fixing if the manufacturer dictated the retail price), but you just can’t
advertise a price lower than the MAP, or you can lose your dealer status.
Competition is usually a good thing. Just because other online stores are sell-
ing what you want to sell doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t jump in and com-
pete with them. When a lot of retailers are selling something online, that’s
usually a good indicator of a hot product line. If you can get the product, sell
it at a competitive price, and make a profit, then do it. If you have product
knowledge to give you an edge, get in there and compete with them!
23
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business
It may not be too late
When we started selling Pokémon cards back
in 1999, only three companies in the Yahoo!
directory even had the word Pokémon in their
Yahoo! directory listing. Now that the Pokémon
phenomenon is over, you can still go to
http://dir.yahoo.com and search for
Pokémon. You find 24 categories for Pokémon
with hundreds of sites listed. Even though we
got in on the late beginning of the Pokémon
boom almost by accident, by the end, hundreds,
if not thousands, of people were selling the
exact same products we were selling. Lots of
competition didn’t stop us from selling hundreds
of thousands of dollars in Pokémon and related
products, but by the time Wal-Mart had what
we had, I knew the fun was over.

Retailing quality products 
and adding value
Sell quality products. You need to be able to stand behind what you carry.
Make sure that what you sell is something that you would want to buy your-
self. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the quality of a product from a photograph
and description. In the short term, you can make some money ripping people
off by selling junk, but when you sell quality merchandise, everyone wins.
Your customers are going to be happy when they get their order, you’re not
going to have a lot of returns, you spend less time on customer service
issues, and you have happy customers who come back and shop again!
Your returns policy says a lot about how you feel about your products.
Merchants with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee or money-back policy
have much higher conversion rates (percentage of browsers who actually buy
something) than retailers with limited or no returns policies or high restock-
ing fees. If you can reduce a customer’s risk, he or she is more likely to buy
from you.
Add value to what you’re selling to distinguish your store from all the others
selling the exact same products. Use your industry and product knowledge to
help your customer solve her problem. Make sure that your customer gets all
the accessories, equipment, supplies, or additional services that go with her
purchase. I hate it when I buy something that needs a funky little battery or
weird light bulbs, and I have to go back and buy something else. Sell me
everything I need the first time.
For example, my good friend (and marketing guru) Brian Evans ordered a dig-
ital camera online. Immediately after receiving his order, the retailer called to
thank Brian for his order and to point out that he didn’t order several acces-
sories he really needed, such as a protective carrying case, extra lenses,
extra batteries, and so on. The retailer provided great customer service by
making sure that Brian had everything he needed for taking pictures of his
family for the holidays and ended up adding a couple hundred dollars in high-
profit items to the sale.
When you’re the expert, you can charge more. If you have tons of online con-
tent like buyer’s guides or other helpful information, you don’t necessarily
have to always be the low-price guy to get the sale. People feel much more
comfortable buying from the experts!
24
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Selling products that encourage 
repeat orders
Sell products that encourage repeat orders. You want to sell products that
people buy over and over again. Sell consumables: food that people eat, sup-
plies that people use up, batteries that run out, items that people consume
(such as vitamins or supplements), or clothes that wear out, go out of style,
or get outgrown.
Sell products that have lots of new releases. Books, magazines, DVDs, video
games, and lots of other entertainment properties always have new products
coming out. We were in the comic book industry for more than 12 years, and
every month we always had a new issue of the Superman comic book to sell.
In addition, you want to maintain a relationship with your customers and
educate them about new products or other items you have that they may not
know about so that you can sell them products again and again. Selling some-
thing to a previous customer is much easier than creating a new customer.
Build up your customer list and market to them through e-mail. (For more on
e-mail marketing, see Chapter 22.)
Maximizing your margins and price points
Every time I would brag about triple-digit sales increases to my father, he
would invariably reply, “It’s not what you gross, son. It’s what you net.” It
took me a while to get that through my somewhat thick skull. Sometimes you
can actually make more money (profit in your pocket at the end of the day)
by selling fewer items when you concentrate on higher-ticket items with
better profit margins. Here’s how it works:
 Sell things that have a decent gross profit margin (a percentage
determined by the retail price minus the wholesale cost divided by
the retail price). Most of the retailers I see selling online have about a 
30 percent margin. The most successful retailers who buy smart or create
their own products have gross margins as high as 80 or 90 percent.
 Sell products with an average order size of $50 to $250. Anything
much more expensive, and some folks have a hard time buying it online
because they’re afraid of getting ripped off or want to see it and hold it
before they buy it. With some items, you can use the Yahoo! Store as a
lead generator to get folks to call your 800 number. Anything less expen-
sive, and you run the risk of doing a whole lot of work for little reward.
Filling a $200 order takes about the same amount of effort as filling a $20
order. That’s why I got out of selling comic books and baseball cards.
25
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

My general rule is to make at least $20 a box in gross profit (your retail
sale minus your wholesale cost). Otherwise, it’s not worth having me
pack a box. Sell something that has a high enough price where you can
actually make enough money filling the order to justify opening a new
customer record, running the credit card, doing the customer service,
and shipping the box.
 Sell higher end products. Customers shopping for budget or entry-level
products seem to be much more price sensitive. Folks who buy the
best products with all the latest features and gizmos generally have
more expendable income, and they’re much more likely to buy other
things, too.
 Don’t try to be the lowest price guy on the Web. There’s always some-
one who will sell something lower than you, sometimes even losing
money on every sale, whether they know it or not. When price is the
only thing that matters to a customer, the sale tends to cause more
headaches. I’d rather not make the sale.
I’ve been inside enough Yahoo! Stores in the past eight years to see that
the retailers who are making all the money are the ones who buy low
doing whatever they can to get the cheapest price from suppliers and
then sell high by discounting as little as they have to. Lots of our suppli-
ers give a 2 percent early pay discount if we pay an invoice within 10
days. Also, if we buy in bulk, by the pallet or case load, we get a better
price. The bigger you get, the more volume you do, and the more negoti-
ating power you have. From time to time, ask your suppliers how you
can get a better discount.
When you sell the exact same thing as another retailer, and that seller
discounts more than you, it can be difficult not to try to meet or beat his
price. Try to get in there and compete with these folks. If they’re dis-
counting off retail price, I’ll discount off retail a bit, but I’m not going to
be the guy selling at cost plus $1.
 Mix it up a little — discount some things and make full margin on
others. Even Wal-Mart uses loss leaders, where it sells items for little or
no profit to get you in the store, where it hopes you’ll buy something
else. Wal-Mart tempts you with impulse items, which usually are the
highest margin and most profitable items. You end up walking out with
six or seven products that you didn’t plan to buy. Do the same thing in
your Yahoo! Store. Learn from the big boys.
Leveraging your knowledge and passion
If you’re really into a subject, you can focus your product knowledge and pas-
sion into your Yahoo! Store. Turn your store into an industry resource about
your subject matter area and make money by selling products.
26
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Find a product niche you know something about. It may be your hobby or it
could be job-related. Sometimes you find out things as an employee or know
a lot about a particular industry. For example, if you work for a large manufac-
turer or distributor, you can see what types of products are selling, or you may
hear of a business opportunity, or you might find a distributor who will drop-
ship for you. It’s important that you find what you sell interesting because
you’ll spend a lot of time writing and talking about your product lines.
Use your knowledge and passion to sell something that you’re excited about.
Folks can tell! You don’t want to sell products you don’t know about or care
about. You’ll be much more successful if you’re excited about what you sell.
Building a New Business from Scratch
Building a new company from scratch is tough work. In e-commerce, the “com-
merce” part is harder than the “e” part. Putting together product photos and
descriptions, designing a good Web store, and even getting ranked in the
search engines are pretty easy. Selling something is a good bit harder. Turning
that Web site into a viable business is a whole ’nother thing. Retailing is tough
work, but if you like people and are into what you sell, it can be a rewarding
way to make a living.
I probably take a lot of what I know about the “commerce” part of e-commerce
for granted because I grew up surrounded by retail. My parents had a mail-
order dog-supply business they started when I was 5. We were always going
to the post office to check for orders, or collating and folding catalogs, or
shipping boxes, or counting inventory. My folks opened their retail store
when I was 11 or 12, and every summer after that, I worked the counter and
unloaded truck after truck of dog food in the sweltering Mississippi heat. I
guess most folks aren’t as lucky.
Planning your business model on a napkin
The first thing I do when I am trying to figure out whether a new business
model is going to work is to sit down at lunch with a napkin and look at the
broad brushstrokes of a business. If you can make something work on a
napkin and explain it to someone else, then odds are you’ll be able to come
up with a business model that can work.
I ask these kinds of questions: What is the gross profit margin in this industry.
What is the average sale? How many visitors am I going to have to get to the
Web site to make a sale? What percentage of the folks will return and buy
stuff? What is the lifetime value of a customer? What other noninventory
costs am I going to have? Is this something that I can do with low overhead,
27
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

or am I going to need a 5,000-sq. ft. warehouse with 20 employees, a phone
system, a network administrator, a bank of computers, and tons of overhead
before I sell my first order?
Limit your overhead, and you limit your exposure. Dip your little toe in the
retailing waters and see whether your new business is going to work before
you quit your day job or blow your nest egg. The last thing you want to do as
a retailer is buy yourself a job where you’re making less money than you
would make with a “real” job.
Using drop-shippers for fun, 
profit, and market research
Drop-shipping, where you take orders without ever touching the merchandise
and your suppliers ship it directly to your customers, is a very effective way
to sell online.
28
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 
Launching a new online business
One of the things that I like to do when I’m
launching a new retail business is determine
the viability of the business from keyword
searches to make sure that enough people are
looking online for what I am going to sell. (I
cover keywords in great detail in Chapter 16.) I
also try to find out how many competitors I have
and then pinpoint the most profitable products,
which are usually the most popular products or
those that have the best margin.
I quickly build a prototype store focused around
a really small group of related products. I can
build out a Yahoo! Store in a day or so with 10 to
15 products with a minimal amount of graphic
design on the site. With paid-search ads (see
Chapter 18), you can buy traffic almost immedi-
ately and get a pretty good idea of how your site
will work. You can see initial conversion rates
on the site, what products people buy, what
pages people look at, and which keywords 
convert.
For example, I did an affiliate project with a
friend of mine who sold hammocks. We were
selling the exact same hammocks that everyone
else was selling online. We had the exact same
product photos and descriptions, and our pric-
ing was very similar because we had to be com-
petitive. We were selling hammocks pretty
much the same way everybody else online was
selling hammocks. Big mistake. 
Well-established retailers had much better mar-
gins because they were moving large volumes
of hammocks. They had sweetheart deals with
the manufacturers, and we had the worst pos-
sible discount with the distributor. We built the
store and spent about $2,000 in paid-search ads
on Google AdWords over a weekend or so to
drive a ton of really qualified traffic across the
site. We were able to see what products sold,
what keywords converted, what ads converted
for folks, and where folks went in the Web store.
We ultimately realized that we were not going
to make any money selling the same exact ham-
mocks everyone else was, so we scaled down
the project.

Here’s how drop-shipping works: You establish an account with a drop-shipper
who is usually a wholesaler, distributor, or sometimes another retailer with
buying power and a large order fulfillment operation. The drop-shipper usually
provides you with product pictures and descriptions for your Yahoo! Store. You
market the drop-shipper’s products online. When the orders come rolling in,
you process the credit cards and then fax or e-mail the drop-shipping company
the customer’s shipping information. The drop-shipper then ships your orders
and charges you wholesale cost and sometimes a drop-ship fee per box.
Hopefully, your customer gets his order and you make a profit. It sounds
almost too easy.
Drop-shipping has huge advantages. It lets you experiment in marketing a
merchandise line without making a huge financial commitment for inventory
that may or may not sell. Drop-shipping also allows you to avoid the tremen-
dous overhead involved in storing and shipping merchandise. By leveraging
someone else’s inventory and personnel, you can put your little toe in a new
merchandise line to see how it will sell in your Yahoo! Store. I know of many,
many Yahoo! Store retailers drop-shipping their products all over the coun-
try, selling millions of dollars through their Yahoo! Stores. 
Unfortunately, multiple problems can also occur with drop-shipping. If you’re
selling a very popular product, then odds are many other retailers will be
using the exact same drop-shipper that you’re using, so you may have lots of
competition. While most drop-shippers are pretty good, you have little or no
control over when your orders ship, so your customer service may suffer. You
also pay drop-shippers more than your competitors who buy the same prod-
ucts direct from the manufacturer and warehouse and ship products them-
selves. Sometimes drop-shipping suppliers sell retail themselves, or hide the
fact that they do by operating a separate company that does retail. Inventory
can also be a problem. There’s nothing more frustrating than having to refund
a paying customer because your supplier can’t fulfill the order. And, of course,
some drop-shippers are better than others. If you find a good one, don’t tell a
soul (except me!).
Keep in mind that drop-shipping isn’t for everyone. I like to have the product
in my hands, which allows me to give better customer service because I
know when I’m almost out of stock, and I know when a customer’s order
shipped. Drop-shipping works great when everything goes right, but when
something gets screwed up, it can be a nightmare. I also get a better discount
from wholesalers because I buy in much larger quantities, so it costs my
wholesaler less to process my orders. Because I do my own shipping, I also
don’t have to pay a drop-ship fee on every box. These factors let me sell for
less or make more money than my drop-shipping competitors. Sometimes I
get to do both, which may make the difference between me making it and my
competition not making it.
If you decide that drop-shipping may be for you, then check out the list of
reliable drop-shippers recommended by Chris Malta’s Worldwide Brands at

Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

www.worldwidebrands.com. He sells the Drop Ship Directory, which has a
list of tons of wholesalers, retailers, and distributors who can ship products
for you directly to your customers.
Looking before you leap
One of my clients called me to help build out his Yahoo! Store. He already had
$25,000 cost-worth inventory in his basement before he knew whether he’d
succeed. Fortunately, the guy is doing very well online, but making an inven-
tory commitment of that size before you even get the first order scares the
heck out of me.
A buddy of mine wanted to jump online and start selling Leap Pads right after
they first came out. He contacted the manufacturer who told him his mini-
mum order for the best wholesale pricing was around $50,000 cost. Ouch! For
my friend to get his little toe into the Leap Pad business before he even filled
the first order, he would have had to mortgage his house and buy an entire
container load of products he was “pretty sure” he’d sell online.
My advice to him was to do some quick market testing and build a store to
see whether he could actually sell the things online before worrying where he
was going to get them. I suggested even going so far as to buy them at retail
through someone like Amazon (even though he’d lose money) to avoid taking
a huge gamble. After you start selling some product, then you make a deal
with the manufacturer and actually make an inventory decision and get seri-
ous about selling. Long story short, the barrier to entry was too high, and he
never got into e-commerce.
Taking an Existing Business Online
We took our existing retail business online when we were selling comic books
and Pokémon cards, where we had around 5,000 different products. In my
point-of-sale system, I had 25,000 different SKUs (stock keeping units), and 
we had 2,000 to 3,000 possible new products that we could sell every single
month. To figure out what we wanted to sell online, I looked at what products
we had the best discount on (the best profit margin) as well as what products
tended to create repeat business.
We sold a lot of war games in our real stores where we’d sell the introductory
boxed set at a steep, steep discount to get new customers into the game.
Research showed that for every dollar that customers spent on the basic set,
they’d spend $6 more on accessories — and these were hobbies where folks
would spend $1,000. My online version of this business model was to do
almost anything to get the customer and then make money selling her other
30
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

stuff later. If I could get her to order from me online for a ridiculously low
price and have a good shopping experience, then hopefully she would con-
tinue to buy from us again and again. It worked great!
Planning is everything! You have a much better chance for success when you
map out a strategy for selling online than when you just put up a Yahoo! Store
and hope to sell something. There are major differences between selling in
the real world and selling virtually.
Creaming your most profitable products
If you’re an existing retailer and you have an existing brick-and-mortar busi-
ness, use the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule) to see what to focus on online.
Twenty percent of your products probably generate 80 percent of your sales.
You want to look at those products first and spend the time and energy to put
those dudes online, and then later, when you have more time, add the other
80 percent of stuff that you sell to your online store. But odds are that you
can cream your product line, just sell your bestselling items online, and still
do most of the business with only 20 percent of the work that you would do
by putting your entire product catalog online.
Leveraging existing inventory to the Web
If you already have a store, then you probably have a lot of inventory. Take
some pictures, write some descriptions, and upload your products to a
Yahoo! Store. Now your inventory is available in your real store and online
in your virtual shop. You get double the mileage out of the same inventory.
Eventually, when you start moving a lot of products, you want to be careful
not to run out of stock on the popular products that you sell online.
Maximizing supplier relationships
When you have an existing business, you have a leg up on people who are
just starting out because you already have a relationship with your suppliers.
Use these tips to maximize your supplier relationships:
 Existing retailers can use their real-world status to get product data-
bases and images from suppliers. For some reason, vendors tend to be
stingy with product data. Manufacturers and wholesalers can give you
additional content for your store, too. Just ask for permission to reuse
articles or sell sheets, PDFs, owner’s manuals, buyer’s guides, or any-
thing else that makes your store better.
31
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business

 Pick your suppliers’ brains from time to time to keep up on industry
trends. Suppliers have a much broader view of the market than any one
retailer, and they can give information on what’s selling elsewhere with
new product ideas you might not notice in your local market.
 Encourage your suppliers to protect their existing customers by
increasing the barriers to entry for new competition. Suggest that they
have large initial orders or higher minimum orders or require a physical
storefront as a condition for buying wholesale.
 Ask your suppliers for a link from their Web site to your Yahoo! Store.
When you do hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year in busi-
ness with a company, it’s really easy to get a link from its site to yours.
Don’t be afraid to ask for a link and hound the company as much as you
can until you get that link. Links from manufacturers and other suppliers
really give you a leg up on the competition because they help your search
engine rankings, which I discuss in much greater detail in Chapter 19.
You’ll also get traffic and sales from these links. When potential customers
are on the manufacturer’s Web site, they’re looking to buy, and I want to
be one of those 10 or 15 stores with a link. If you don’t ask, you don’t get
(a link), so ask!
Selling locally while shipping globally
When you sell both online and offline, sometimes you need two different sets
of prices. There’s more online competition, so you have to be much more
price conscious when you sell online. But because your costs are lower sell-
ing online, you can actually make more online than you do offline.
However, the last thing you want to do is alienate your local customers, so
my strategy has always been to use a different business name online and not
use my Yahoo! Store as my company site. I won’t deny that I sell online, but
I won’t rub it in my local customers’ faces, either.
My brother and I went from not selling online to the Pokémon explosion with
80 percent of our sales volume suddenly coming from our Yahoo! Stores. Our
business model changed, and it happened almost overnight. With four times
the sales coming over e-mail, fax, and phone, it was easy to get distracted and
neglect our local customers.
We were making so much more money selling online than we were offline, so
we eventually sold our brick-and-mortar comic stores to concentrate on mar-
keting our Yahoo! Stores selling comics, games, and gift stuff. This shift in our
business model was a way to maximize our business and reduce our over-
head. We also moved from an expensive retail shopping center to a cheaper
industrial park warehouse and made more money by reducing our overhead.
My mom’s company now has a big warehouse that also serves a retail loca-
tion, too. Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it, too!

Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Migrating to Yahoo! Store from 
Another Storefront System
Moving from another shopping cart system to Yahoo! Store can be confusing,
but if you do your homework, assemble the right elements, and have a posi-
tive attitude, you can actually improve your store. About a third of my devel-
opment clients started their stores on another shopping cart and wanted to
move to Yahoo! Store and Merchant Solutions.
Making the transition
Even if you’re not a Web developer or a super-geek, Yahoo! Store is still
extremely easy for you to use. Of course, if you can export a database that
has your product information in it, you have the graphic files and the tem-
plates that folks use to build your Web site, and you can export your pic-
tures, it is very easy to take a feed, a database, or an export of another
shopping cart store and turn that into another Yahoo! Store. See Chapter 23
for getting down with product uploads and Chapter 12 for info on creating
products.
33
Chapter 2: Planning Your Online Small Business
Finessing manufacturer’s descriptions
I tend to rewrite our manufacturer’s descrip-
tions on our bestselling products for multiple
reasons:
 Unique product descriptions distinguish
you from the competition. Your customer is
probably looking at several different Web
sites selling the exact same product at
almost the same price. When your Yahoo!
Store has much more product detail than
the generic manufacturer’s description with
a different caption or product description,
odds are that you’re going to get the sale.
 You can do better search engine optimiza-
tion when you’re writing your own product
descriptions. Manufacturers tend to write
for themselves. They use industry buzz-
words and often refer to a product without
using the words that shoppers are search-
ing for.
 You can show off your industry and product
expertise in your sales copy. When I shop
online, I prefer to buy from sites that take a
position and recommend which products I
should buy. I want to know which products
are better than others for my particular
application. I also want to know that the
folks I’m giving my hard-earned money to
actually know about the products they sell.

Copying your old site’s look and feel
Copying the design of your old site to a new Yahoo! Store is important to give
continuity to existing customers. You can build your store in three different
ways:
 Use the Yahoo! Store Editor and standard templates. Use Variables, the
global controls that control store layout and appearance, in the Store
Editor to create a look and feel that is very similar to your other Web
site. You can make a very nice-looking, easy-to-use, fast-loading, search-
engine-friendly online store.
 Use RTML to duplicate the HTML template from your other Web site.
Wrap that template around normal Yahoo! Store functionality. Copy your
images to your Web-hosting account and you’re all set. See Chapter 27
for more on RTML.
 Use the new Merchant Solutions Store Tags to plug in access to your
Catalog Manager product database and Yahoo! Store functionality into
copies of your old store’s HTML pages. Store Tags allow you to put a
little snippet of code on each HTML product page that says, “Hey, this
is the product information for item 1234.” When you change the name,
price, caption, or even the picture in the Catalog Manager and you’re
using Store Tags, the Yahoo! Server changes the information on your
Merchant Solutions HTML pages automatically. I don’t build Yahoo!
Stores this way and prefer using the Store Editor over using Store Tags.

S
o you’re about to open a Yahoo! Store. Congratulations! You’re now
ahead of about 95 percent of folks who dream of doing their own thing,
but never do anything but talk about it.
The most important thing you can do is start. Don’t overthink it. Don’t worry
about picking the best domain ever. Just grab a domain, create a Yahoo! ID,
and open a Merchant Solutions account.
In this chapter, I show you how to jump-start your online store. You create a
new Yahoo! ID, open a Merchant Solutions account, and jump right into store
building with the Store Editor. In the Editor, you create sample sections and
product pages, upload some pictures, and publish your store. Finally, you
place a test order.
When you see how fast you can get a working e-commerce site up and run-
ning, the entrepreneurial juices start to flow!
Registering with Yahoo!
You’re ready to start your store when you have a domain name registered. If
you haven’t picked out a domain yet, take a look at Chapter 24, where I dive
into the details of dot-coms and DNSs and help you master your domain.
Before you get started store building or open your account, you need to reg-
ister with Yahoo! by creating a Yahoo! ID.

A Yahoo! ID is your passport to all things Yahoo! Your ID is proof that you are
who you say you are. With your ID, you can log in and edit your store, make
changes to your domain name and e-mail accounts, export orders, and even
cancel your store. A Yahoo! ID identifies you as the owner of a specific account,
which gives you access to the back door of your online store. Your Yahoo! ID
also stores the credit-card data you use to pay for your Yahoo! Small Business
products and services.
Only the person with the master Yahoo! ID (login and password and security
key) can access all the features of a Merchant Solutions account, including
configuring domains and playing with the Web-hosting File Manager, among
other things. 
Creating your Yahoo! ID
If you have ever had a Yahoo! e-mail account, you have a Yahoo! ID. The ID is
part of the e-mail address before the @ sign: the whatever@yahoo.com. If
you have Yahoo! e-mail, you probably already have a Yahoo! ID, but I recom-
mend making a new one for this store.
Before you create your Yahoo! ID, make sure that you can get to your e-mail
because Yahoo! sends a confirmation message with a link that you have to
click to verify your e-mail address. Create your Yahoo! ID by following these
steps:
1. Go to http://edit.yahoo.com.
If you’re logged in with another Yahoo! ID, you have to log out. In the
lower right corner, you see the text “Don’t have a Yahoo! ID? Signing up
is easy.”
2. Click the Sign Up link.
The Yahoo! ID signup page appears. Because it’s going to be your perma-
nent Yahoo! ID for the store, try to make it the same as your domain
name. With 60,000,000 plus Yahoo! ID’s, odds are your name is taken,
but your can always use something like yourdomain.com.
For example, my example store is http://ystorebooks.com, and my
Yahoo! ID is ystorebooks. If that ID was taken, I would have tried
ystorebooks.com. I have too many logins and IDs and passwords
to remember these days, so I try to make my life easier when I can!
3. Type your first name, last name, gender, and a whole bunch of other
information and click the I Agree button.
The Registration: Please Activate Your Account page appears to ask you
to check your e-mail for a note from Yahoo! Member Services.
36
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Note: Eventually, you’ll forget your password. Everyone does, so don’t
feel too bad. Fortunately, you’ll have a security question with an answer
that you and only you should know. Your Yahoo! Security Question is
something like what is your pet’s name, the name of your first school, or
your childhood hero. Not only are you going to have to remember what
the question is, but you’re going to have to remember exactly what the
answer is. Make your answer really easy, because you have to type it
exactly right.
4. Print this page and stick it in a file folder.
This way, you don’t have to remember your security question or answer.
I make a file folder with all of my Yahoo! account information, including
the Yahoo! ID, password, security question, security answer, birthday,
zip code on the credit card, alternate e-mail address, and (at least) the
last eight digits of the credit card.
Keep this info handy (but safe). When you have technical support issues,
the nice people at Yahoo! Store Technical Support are going to ask you for
this information to make sure that some unauthorized person isn’t trying
to fix your Yahoo! Store. I also keep my Yahoo! Security Key and my
Security Key questions and answers on the same sheet of paper, but
they’re written in my chicken-scratch handwriting, which gives me the
highest level of encryption.
5. Go to your e-mail account and look for an important message from
Yahoo!.
6. Click the Important! Click Here To Activate Your New Account link.
You see a page that asks for your Yahoo! password.
7. Enter your Yahoo! password into the form and click the Verify button.
You see a page that says Your Alternate Email Address Has Been
Verified. Now you have a Yahoo! ID.
Make sure that your credit-card information is current. When your card expires
or is declined, Yahoo! sends you several e-mails and puts a warning notice
inside your Store Manager. Eventually, Yahoo! Billing gives up and deletes your
account with very little warning. Getting a deleted Merchant Solutions account
reinstated requires several miracles happening at the same time.
Creating a Yahoo! security key
For additional security, there is also a second-level password called a security
key. You have to type your security key every time you do anything involving
credit cards or other really sensitive information, including configuring
domains and editing or deleting accounts. If you haven’t set up your security
key, here’s how to do it:
37
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

1. Click the Change My Security Key link.
A page appears that says, “Your account does not have a Security Key.
Sign up for a Security Key or continue.”
2. Click the Sign Up For A Security Key link, which takes you to the
Yahoo! Security Key Sign Up page.
Choose your security key, select your forgotten security key question,
and answer the question. Write this information down and put it in your
file folder.
3. Give Yahoo! your e-mail address, zip code, and country, and finally
confirm the credit card in your Yahoo! Wallet to prove that you are
who you say you are.
4. Click the Submit This Form button.
5. Click the Finished button to save all your changes.
Opening Your Yahoo! Merchant 
Solutions Account
You need two things when you open your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions account:
a Yahoo! ID and a domain name. You need to either have a domain name
already registered at Yahoo! (see Chapter 24) or another registrar or register
a brand-spanking new domain when you create your Merchant Solutions
account. You also need a new Yahoo! ID and a Security Key, which you can
read about in the section “Registering with Yahoo!,” earlier in this chapter.
A Yahoo! Merchant Solutions account isn’t the same thing as a merchant
account. A merchant account is a business bank account with a company
that processes your credit-card transactions for a fee and then deposits the
money into your business checking account anywhere from 12 hours to
2 weeks later, depending on your account. To process credit cards, you need
either a merchant account or a PayPal account (which requires using the
New Checkout Manager). If you don’t have a merchant account, Yahoo! hooks
you up with its partner bank, Paymentech.
Figure 3-1 shows the Yahoo! sales page for the three different Merchant
Solutions packages: Starter, Standard, and Professional. Yahoo! Store has
a monthly fee of $39.95 for Starter, $99.95 for Standard, or $299.95 for
Professional. Start cheap and upgrade later. Begin with Starter or Standard.
When you start doing any real volume of sales, then start paying the $300 
a month for Professional. Go to http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
merchant to read up on the accounts. For more on comparing plans, read
Chapter 1, where I talk about the differences in the three plans.

Want to save $50? Every time I’ve opened a Merchant Solutions account, I got
the $50 signup fee waived by calling the Yahoo! Sales line at 1-866-781-9246. A
salesperson babysat me while I walked through the various steps and gave
me a coupon code at the end of the transaction. The Yahoo! folks are always
nice and helpful. I guess they give you the $50 because they figure they lose
fewer customers in the signup process if they can answer any questions and
walk you through it. Who knows whether this waiver will last?
Go to http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/merchant to open your
Merchant Solutions account:
1. Click Starter (or Standard if you prefer) and click the Sign Up button.
The Search For Your Domain Name/Have A Domain Name page appears.
2. Type your domain name in the search box and click the Continue
button.
Yahoo! checks the WHOIS database (the public database of all the domain
names in the world) and knows that it’s a real domain name. You see a
confirmation page with your domain name, your Merchant Solutions plan,
and a button where Yahoo! double-checks to make sure that it’s your
domain name.

card number, the expiration date, the CV2 number, and your billing
address if you want to set up a Yahoo! Store. Type all your informa-
tion and click the Continue button.
Yahoo! actually verifies your credit-card number while you wait, so it
make take up to 2 minutes to place your order and to log in to your site.
Be patient. It takes a couple of days or so for your domain name to prop-
agate across the entire Web and point to your Yahoo! Store (whether you
have a newly registered Yahoo! domain or a domain with another regis-
trar.) Until then, you’re able to edit and publish your store, which shows
up on a temporary Yahoo! URL.
You’re making no long-term commitment to Yahoo!. I just signed a five-
year lease on my retail location, so a month-to-month lease sounds pretty
good. Yahoo! also auto-renews your order and charges your credit card
each month until you tell it otherwise. Make sure that you keep your
credit-card information current with Yahoo! unless you want to run the
risk of getting your store shut off!
If your domain was registered elsewhere, you need to change the
DNSs (domain name servers) to point to Yahoo!’s name servers: yns1.
yahoo.com and yns2.yahoo.com. Changing DNSs sounds worse than
it is. All you do is log in to your account at your registrar, change the
DNS settings, update your account, and wait a couple of days. Most 
registrars have an 800 number if you need help.
The Small Business Home: Welcome To Yahoo! Merchant Solutions page

which you can download.

Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Jumping into Store Building
I can spend a lot of time yapping about what I do when I build a store and my
store design philosophy for converting more shoppers into buyers, but I know
you’re chomping at the bit to get going on your own store.
Unlike most of the rest of this book, you need to do the rest of this chapter
in the same order that I do, or you may not get the same results I do. Here’s
what you do to dive right in to building your store with the Store Editor (see
Chapter 9):
1. Configure the Store Editor.
Make store building easier by switching to the more powerful Advanced
mode and turn off things that can slow you down. You also play with the
global variables, which control the look and feel of the store.
2. Create and edit some real pages.
Build sample sections and products, upload pictures, move the items
around, rearrange the store, and create sample info and privacy policy
pages. Edit the home page.
3. Publish your store.
Now anyone in the world can see your handiwork.
4. Place a test order.
Now you can see how fast you can actually get a real store up and run-
ning and taking orders.
Adding some test products and making a functioning store should take less
than an hour unless you’re pokey or get stuck on some design decisions.
Don’t make it pretty, just make it work for now!
1. Sign in with your Yahoo! ID 
and log in to Store Editor
Every time you do something in the Store Editor, you have to sign in with
your Yahoo! ID and log in to your Merchant Solutions account.
1. Point your browser to http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
merchant.
Figure 3-2 shows what you see when you sign in: your Business Console
with Manage My Services with all your Merchant Solutions accounts.
Each account has links to your Store Manager, web hosting, domains,
and e-mail.
41
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

2. Click the Store Manager link.
Figure 3-3 shows the Store Manager page. The Store Manager is your 
virtual back office. It’s the center of your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
account, where you access orders, study statistics, and control the
order settings, such as tax, payment methods, and shipping methods
and rates. Notice the page views and revenue graphs, which show you
traffic and sales every time you log in. I discuss the Store Manager in
minute detail in Chapter 15.
3. Click the Store Editor link.
Figure 3-4 shows the Store Editor. You’re now on the home page
(index.html) in Edit mode. If you change the default Editor Entry Page
under Controls from home page (the default) to Contents, when you
click the Store Editor link on the Store Manager page, the Contents page
appears instead of the home page. The Contents page is a hierarchical
site map that shows all the objects in your store and the products and
sections within each object. If you do see the Contents page, click the
Index link to move from the Contents page to the home page.
The Store Editor is a working copy of your store, where you can manage all
your products as well as make store design and layout changes. You control
who has access to the Editor on the Store Manager’s Access page (see
Chapter 15), and the Editor is available only to your Yahoo! ID and any other
Yahoo! ID’s you let in the back door. You can make layout and design changes
to your store, as well as add, edit, and delete products. When you’re ready to
make the changes public, click the Publish button, which updates the public
version of your store almost instantly.

Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

The Store Editor is already familiar to you because it’s a copy of your site
with an Edit Nav-bar stuck on top. Move around in your Store Editor the same
way a customer navigates your published store. Click links, icons, and naviga-
tion buttons to get to the items or sections you want to edit. Each page has
an Edit button (on the Edit Nav-bar), which you can click to edit the Name,
Caption, Code, Price, Image, and other fields.
Figure 3-5 shows you the Edit buttons or Edit Nav-bar, which appears at the
bottom (or top) of virtually every page of the Store Editor. The Edit buttons
let you create, edit, and move pages around; make changes to your global
variables, which determine the look and feel of your store; control and con-
figure your Store Editor settings; and move around the Store Editor.
2. Configure the Store Editor 
for store building
You can configure the Store Editor for easier store building. Hide the useless
stuff and crank up the Editor to Advanced mode. Following are my first round
of tweaks:
44
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 
Don’t panic!
You can easily get confused when you have two
versions of your store. Am I on the Editor? Or am
I on the published store? Don’t panic! It reminds
me of that classic Star Trek episode where two
parallel dimensions somehow collide, resulting
in two Enterprises and two of every crew
member running into each other. The only way
you could tell the evil Captain Kirk and Mr.
Spock from the good versions were their
cheesy black goatees. Now that I think about it,
one of those guys ordered from one of Mom’s
Yahoo! Stores.
If you’re ever not sure which version of your
store you’re in — the Store Editor or the pub-
lished site — look for the Edit Nav-bar; if you
see it, you’re in the Editor. You can also look at
the URL in your browser’s address bar. If you
see your domain name, then you’re on the pub-
lished site and need to log in to make changes
to your site. If you see a URL that looks some-
thing like the following URL, you’re in Store
Editor:
http://edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/NEWEDIT.
yhst-17192271484370/
c7a5fd63345f/C5ccoAAH
The most common way to get booted out of the
Store Editor and over to the published version
of your site is by clicking links you made to the
real version of your store. Notice that all the
Editor-created links to your home page (home
buttons, Name-image, Index, Button, and so on)
point to index.html and not to www.your
domain.com. These relative path links work
in both the Editor and on the published site.

 Hide Help: Click the Hide Help button to make all the definitions under
each field go away. All you have to do is click the Help button, and they’re
back again. After about 5 minutes, the Help files just get in the way.
 Turn on Advanced mode: Click the little red arrow to the right of the
Edit buttons to change the Store Editor from Basic mode to Advanced
mode, which gives you access to all the fields, settings, and power tools
the Store Editor possesses.
 Move the Edit buttons to the top of your Editor: Click the Config
button. The Editor page appears to make your Store Editor behave.
3. Create sample pages
After you’ve poked around the Editor a bit, you can create some sample
pages, edit them, upload pictures, make a product page, and make a special
on the home page. Here’s how to create a sample page:
1. Navigate to the home page by clicking the Home button.
When you’re on the home page, you can create a sample section.
2. Click the Section button on the Edit Nav-bar.
Figure 3-6 displays a new section’s Edit page, where you can enter page
information like Name or Caption and upload images. For now, just give
this section page a name.

Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

3. Type the name in the Name field and click the Update button.
The page you created appears. Because you created a section on the
home page, that section is part of the top-level navigation for the site.
Any pages on the home page do double duty by also appearing in the
navigation bar. Notice that the button text is from the text you typed
into the Name field.
4. To add more information to the page, click the Edit button.
The Edit page for your section page appears. Notice that the ID is cre-
ated from what you typed into the Name field, and the type is Item, even
though it’s a section page.
You can’t edit Type or ID in Store Editor. After you create a page, ID and
Type are permanent. I talk a lot more about IDs and Store Editor in
Chapter 9.
Because this page was created with the Section button, the only Object
Properties (the fields of an item, section, or other page) you see are
Name, Image, Headline, Caption, Contents, Abstract, Icon, Inset, Label,
Leaf, and Product-url.
5. Change the text in the Name field from whatever it is to something a
little different so that you can see how edits change things.
Figure 3-6:
The Edit
page for a
section or
item lets 
you enter or
edit page
information
and upload

46
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

6. Add your text in the Caption field.
For example, if I were creating a page on widgets, I might write the fol-
lowing in the Caption field:
<strong>Wonder widgets</strong> simply work wonders! Make any house a home,
improve your posture, and impress your friends.
Not sure what widget you need? Try the WWW-430, our bestselling Wonder
Widget! Order yours today and get free shipping.
7. Click the Update button.
The edited section page appears with the change to the Name appearing
on the page itself in the Headline, as well as on the left on the button
text in the navigation bar. Notice that the new Caption text appears.
Section pages need some text in the Caption, or they look kind of boring. I
like to write a short paragraph or two to give customers a quick overview
of the products in that section. Make the Caption text descriptive enough to
show off your product knowledge, but keep it short enough to not push the
products down the page and off the screen. Section pages with keyword-rich
Caption fields are more search-engine friendly than pages with empty Captions.
I talk a lot more about search engines in Chapter 19.
Captions are special fields. If you have two line breaks in your text, the Store
Editor displays your text the same way. You can type limited amounts of
HTML inside your Caption fields to format text, display images, and do
almost anything else HTML can do. For example, I like to use strong tags
around keywords to emphasize them. You can make important words or
phrases appear bolder or darker by placing a <strong> tag before the text
you want to emphasize and a </strong> tag after the text.
Upload an image to your section page
Section pages don’t need huge images because they take up lots of room and
push the products down the page, but they do need some kind of image to
make a thumbnail if you show your contents or top-level navigation on the
home page.
An image around 100 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide should match your text
pretty well. You can use pretty much any JPEG or GIF files you have. 
It’s hard to sell anything without a picture, so you need to upload an image.
Here’s how to upload an item’s image:
1. Click the Edit button to edit your section page.
You return to the Edit page, where you can upload an image.
2. Scroll to the Image button and click the Upload button.
The Image Upload page appears. You can upload images and other files
from your computer to your Yahoo! Store.
47
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

3. Click the Browse button.
The File Upload window lets you browse your hard drive like you would
in Windows Explorer when you’re looking for files to open.
4. Browse to the image file you want to upload, select it, and click the
Open button.
The path to the file on your computer is magically pasted into the field.
It should look something like this:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\item.jpg
5. Click the Send button to upload your file to the Yahoo! image server.
When the file is finished uploading, the section page appears with the
new image you uploaded.
Figure 3-7 shows my Wonder Widgets section page with an image uploaded.
The Store Editor does all the heavy lifting on images so that you don’t have
to know HTML or know the URL or path to your image files. The Store Editor
standard page template places your uploaded image where it’s supposed to
go. The Editor also automatically resizes your images to fit on the product
page with the item-height and item-width settings under Variables.
Also, Store Editor makes thumbnails so that you don’t have to! A smaller ver-
sion of each page’s image is created as a thumbnail for the home page or any
section or product pages this item appears in. Pretty cool! I talk a lot more
about images in Chapter 9.
Figure 3-7:

Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

You can also upload an image to a product or section page by clicking the
Image button on the Edit Nav-bar. You can’t delete an image from here, but
you can upload a new one, bypassing the Edit page.
Create a sample item
An item (or product) page is just like a section page, but item pages display
additional product fields, such as Code, Price, Sale-price, Orderable, Options,
and so on, which are hidden on section pages.
Here’s how to create an item:
1. Navigate to your section page.
2. Click the Item button on the Edit Nav-bar to create a new item.
Now you’re on the new item’s Edit page, where you can type product
information into the various fields. Notice how it looks almost like a sec-
tion page, but with added product information fields.
3. Type the name of your product into the Name field.
4. Type your code in the Code field.
5. Type your price in the Price field.
6. Click the Update button to create your first item.
The newly created item page appears with the name, the code, the price,
and an Order button. The text on the Order button is set under Variables
in the Order-text field. I always edit my Order-text and use Add To Cart
or Add To My Order rather than Order or Buy.
When you create an item on a section page, that item appears on the section
page as text and/or an image, which is linked to the item page. The item’s link
text on the section page comes from text in the item’s Name field. The item’s
thumbnail image on the section page (if it has one) comes from the picture
uploaded to the Image field unless the item has a separate image file uploaded
to the Icon field, which replaces the Image as thumbnail. I talk a lot more
about items and section pages in Chapter 11.
Edit the Sale-price and Option fields
Hey! You don’t have to edit one field at a time and update. You can make all
your edits at the same time, even when you create an item in the first place. I
tend to edit, look at my changes, edit again, tweak something else, and edit
yet it again. I love the fact that when you add product info or images to your
Yahoo! Store, you get to see what your customers are gonna see as soon as
you click the Update button. Those Viaweb folks did a great job creating the
Store Editor!
49
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

I’ve broken editing these fields out as separate steps to minimize confusion.
I’m throwing a lot at you in this chapter. Don’t feel like you have to remember
most of this material. I believe in open-book tests!
When you sell products online, you normally have to discount from a manu-
facturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) if you want to be price competitive.
Here’s how to show a discounted price using the Sale-price field:
1. Navigate to your product page.
2. Click the Edit Item button to go to the item’s Edit page.
The Price field appears on your page.
Both Price and Sale-price fields take prices with or without dollar signs.
Also, if an item only has one price, stick it in the Price field and leave
Sale-price blank, or it will look funny. For example, if you leave the Price
blank and type $79 in the Sale-price field, you’ll wind up with text like
“Regular Price $0.00, Sale Price $79.00.”
3. Type the discounted price in the Sale-price field.
4. Type the normal price (or manufacturer’s suggested retail price) in
the Price field.
5. Click the Update button to update the item.
The product appears with a Price and a Sale-price.
Many products you sell come in many different flavors of style, size, color,
and other options. (See Chapter 12 for more options with option fields.)
Options are pretty easy to work with in a Yahoo! Store:
 The first word or phrase in the Options field is the option name.
 Each word or phrase after that is an option value.
 Surround phrases with quotes to keep phrases together as a single name
or option.
 Multiple options are easy, too. Separate totally different options (such 
as color and size) with two line breaks by pressing the Enter key twice
between separate options, which leaves a blank line between different
options in the Options field.
Here’s how to use the Options field:
1. Go to your product page.
2. Click the Edit Item button to go to the Edit page.
50
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

3. Type your text in the Options field.
For example, I typed the following:
Size Small Medium Large “Extra Large”
“Gadget Color” Red White Blue
4. Click the Update button to update the item.
Your item appears with drop-down menus for each option.
Add specials to your home page
Making a product a special simply places the item on your home page by
putting the object ID in the Specials field of the home page. You can make
items or sections appear as specials by editing the home page and just typing
the object-IDs in the Specials field. For more than one product, type the IDs 
in the order that you want the specials to appear on the home page.
Here’s how to feature a section or item as a special on the home page:
1. Browse to the page you want to feature as a special.
2. Click the Special button in the Edit Nav-bar.
Figure 3-8 shows your home page with specials. Notice the thumbnail
and link to the Gadget-5000 (or whatever else you made the special).
3. Click the product’s thumbnail or link.
The product page appears. Notice in the Edit Nav-bar that the Special
button now says “Not Special.” To remove the Special you created, all
you have to do is click that button.
Figure 3-8:

51
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

You can also make items or sections home-page specials simply by editing
the home page and typing the IDs in the Specials field in the order that you
want the specials to appear on the home page. The appearance of home-page
specials is controlled by several settings on the home page itself and is cov-
ered in much detail in Chapter 12.
Introduce Variables by changing your button colors
Unlike each section or item page that has its own Edit page, only one Variables
page exists. The settings on the Variables page determine the look and feel of
your site. The Variables page is divided up into Colors and Typefaces, Image
Dimensions, Page Layout, Button Properties, Page Properties, Store Properties,
and Custom Variables. I cover all these variables in the book, but especially in
Chapter 9.
Figure 3-9 shows the Variables page.
Here’s how to change the color of the buttons across the entire site:
1. Click the Variables button on your Edit Nav-bar.
The Variables Edit page appears.
Figure 3-9:
Variables

the look,
layout, and

52
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

2. Scroll down to the Button-color variable.
Notice the color of the bar, three numbers in a field, and a link to Choose
A Color. If you know the RGB number for a color, you can type it. RGB
stands for red green blue and is how computer monitors display color. The
number is the amount of each color, which is anywhere from 0 to 255.
3. Type 255 0 0 in the Button-color field and press Tab to move to
another field.
Notice that the color of the bar changes from whatever it was before to a
bright fire-engine red! Choosing 255 0 0 makes the color 100 percent red,
plus 0 percent green, plus 0 percent blue, which is one of my favorite
colors.
4. Scroll to top of the page and click the Update button.
Whatever page you were on before you clicked the Variable button
appears. The buttons are red on every page on your site.
4. Publish your site, and 
you’re live on the Web
You’ve made changes to your store, but only you can see what you’ve done. If
you’re ready to show your work to the world, you can publish to update the
public version of your site by following these steps:
1. Browse to the home page by clicking the Home button.
2. Click the Publish button.
The Publish Status page appears. If you want to keep editing, you can
wait here until the Return To Editor link appears. If you want to see you
changes (I do!), then go to your published site.
3. Click the Go To Manager link.
The Store Manager appears.
4. Click the View Your Site link to go to your Store Editor–built site.
The published version of your Store Editor–built store appears. It may
be in one of several places, depending on how your domain’s entry point
is set up and whether you redirect all store.yahoo.com URLs to your
domain:
http://store.YourDomain.com/index.html
www.YourDomain.com/index.html
http://store.yahoo.com/YourAccountName/index.html
http://store.yahoo.com/yhst-YourAccountNumber/
index.html
53
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

5. Browse around the published version of your site and place a test
order.
You’re just getting started. As you build your store, you’re really building your
business. Don’t worry too much about making money at first. Momentum is the
main thing. Your store doesn’t have to be the best site on the Web; it just needs
to be on the Web. And soon!
I’m a big believer in implementing now and tweaking later. The faster you
open your store, the faster you’ll make the mistakes you need to make to 
discover the things you need to know to make your store a success.
Configuring Your Store Manager
Setting up your tax rates, shipping methods and rates, and payment methods
is the second half of the equation when creating a store. By default, your
Yahoo! Store doesn’t collect sales tax, offers air and ground shipping with no
shipping charge, and accepts only Visa as a payment method. To introduce
you to the Store Manager’s various features, you should set up sales tax
rates, configure shipping methods and rates, create the order confirmation
page and e-mail message, and activate your merchant order notification fax
and e-mail.
After you make changes to the order settings, you see a red asterisk to the
right of the Publish Order Settings link. Click the link to make your changes to
the real store. After a moment, the changes have been made, the asterisk and
link disappear, and they’re replaced with the word Published so that you
know that your settings match the real store settings.
Accessing the Store Manager
The Store Manager is like your back office in your Yahoo! account. When you
log in to your Yahoo! ID, and then go to the Manage My Services page and
http://store.yahoo.com, you must first go to the Store Manager before
you can access the Store Editor.
When you’re in the Store Editor, click the Home button to go to the home page.
To return to the Store Manager, click the Manager button. Sometimes it’s easier
just to type http://store.yahoo.com and click the Store Manager link. You
can also bookmark your Store Manager page for easy access.
54
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Setting your sales tax rate
To set up sales tax, go to the Store Manager and follow these steps:
1. Click the Tax Rates link under Order Settings.
The tax calculation page appears. You can change whether you collect
sales tax, add or edit rows to your tax rules, or use the Auto Setup
Wizard to set up your tax calculations. Use the wizard!
2. Click the Auto Setup Wizard link.
The page that appears assumes that you’re based in the United States.
3. Click the Next button.
Now you’re on the list of states that collect sales tax.
4. Select the state(s) where you collect sales tax and click the Done button.
If you need to collect sales tax in multiple states, hold down Ctrl while
you select the states.
5. Change Tax Calculation for Customers to Calculate In Real-Time.
6. Click the Update button.
Notice that the Publish Order Settings link is back with a red asterisk.
7. Click the Publish Order Settings link to publish the changes to your
order settings.
Configuring shipping methods and rates
Shipping Manager is located under Order Settings. In the Shipping Manager,
you control your shipping methods, your shipping rates, and UPS settings.
Shipping Manager also has links to register to use UPS Online tools (it’s free!).
Set up shipping methods before you set up your shipping rates. You can do
so many things with the Shipping Manager; I recommend that you look at the
full Yahoo! Resource and Help Files.
Setting up your shipping methods
In Yahoo! Store Manager, you can delete the default methods (Air and
Ground) and set up your own shipping methods. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Shipping Manager link under Order Settings.
The Shipping Manager page appears, where you can do all kinds of stuff.
You want to set up Shipping Methods.
55
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

2. Click the Shipping Methods link.
You see a page where you can edit shipping methods or change the dis-
play order.
3. Click the Edit Methods button.
Now you’re on the Edit Methods page of the Shipping Manager, where
you have the following options:
• You can select from General Methods, such as Downloadable, Two
Day Delivery, Ground, Federal Express, First Class Mail, One Day
Delivery, or Air.
• You can add Custom Methods.
• You can sign up for UPS Online Tools and use UPS’s methods.
I prefer to create my own methods and use a very simple shipping busi-
ness model based upon getting new orders and eating some of my ship-
ping costs as a marketing expense.
I see increases in conversion rates and decreases in dropped shopping
carts (folks bailing in the middle of an order) when I offer two ground
methods: a free shipping promotional rate for orders over a certain
amount and a flat rate amount for orders less than that. Here’s how you
can set up the same method:
1. Type FREE UPS GROUND (on US48 orders over $99) in the New
Method Name field and click the Add button.
2. Type Standard Shipping (US48) $5.95 in the New Method Name
field and click the Add button.
3. Deselect the Ground and Air defaults check boxes and click the
Update button.
You return to the Ship Methods page.
4. Click the Change Display Order button.
The Change Display Order page appears.
5. Highlight the FREE UPS method, click the up or down arrows to
make it first, and then click the Update button.
You have to Publish Order Settings, but after you do that, your new
custom methods are live in the checkout.
Setting your shipping rates
You should be in the Yahoo! Store Manager. Here’s how to delete the default
methods (Air and Ground) and set up your own shipping rates:
56
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

1. Click the Shipping Manager link under Order Settings.
2. Click the Shipping Rates link.
You see a page where you can edit shipping methods or change the dis-
play order.
3. Click the Add Rule button to create a new shipping charge.
Now you’re on the 5-Step Add Rule Wizard. Do the little ship-rate dance.
The radio buttons are set to Specific Location, and Inside: US United
States, which is fine.
4. In Step 1 of the wizard, scroll down and click the Next button.
Note: UPS Ground to Hawaii and Alaska is available now, which I don’t
really understand.
Step 2 of 5: Add Rule - Select Method(s) appears. The default And Ship
Method Matches Any is fine.
5. Click the Next button.
Now you’re on Step 3 of 5: Choose a Rule Type page.
6. Select Rate Table and click the Next button.
Now you’re on Step 4 of 5: Rate Table Details page. The default is set to
Based on: Taxable_Amount, which is fine. Because this rule is for folks
who ordered more than $99, you really don’t have to put anything here
because this shipping method’s rate is “free.” However, you need to do
something for the folks who order $10 and think they’ll get shipping just
because they select it. Nope!
7. In the first field (From 0, Add $), type 5.95.
8. In the second field (From: ___), type 99 and click the Next button.
Now the checkout charges orders less than $99 the standard shipping
rate of $5.95, whether or not the buyer chooses it.
You’re now on the Step 5 of 5: Override Setting page.
9. Click the Done button.
Note: I don’t like Exclude All Other shipping rules. I don’t want to override
anything because I like to use an additive method of ship rates. For example,
if someone from Hawaii orders something under $99, I’ll add a non-US48
upcharge to the $5.95 rate. If someone from Alaska orders something over
$99, eventually I’ll have a separate non-US48 upcharge for those orders.
Setting your payment methods
In the Yahoo! Store Manager, you can add MasterCard, Visa, and American
Express to your Pay Methods. Follow these steps:
57
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

1. Click the Pay Methods link under Order Settings.
2. Type your Yahoo! security key.
Anytime you access or make changes to sensitive information, such
as domains, your account information, account access, and customer
credit-card info, Yahoo! asks you for a second-level password called
your security key to verify your identity. If you don’t have a security key,
follow the prompts to create one.
If you have a security key, you see the Pay Methods page, where you can
apply for a new merchant account, configure your store to work with
your existing merchant account, and add or edit the Payment Methods
that appear on your checkout.
If you’ve already set up your online credit-card processing, adding a card
to your Payment Methods that your merchant bank account doesn’t
accept doesn’t work, so don’t try it.
3. Change the radio buttons for the Payment Methods you want to add
from No to Yes.
I select American Express, MasterCard, and Discover. For more informa-
tion on credit cards, see Chapter 15.
This page is a cool place to snag credit-card icons. Simply right-click the
ones you want and save them to your desktop.
4. Click the Done button.
Working with order confirmations 
and merchant notifications
When a customer clicks the Place Order button, the next page he sees is his
Order Confirmation page, which shows a copy of his order with a unique
order number and verifies that the order was actually placed. Next, the cus-
tomer gets an order confirmation e-mail with the same information. You can
add text to both of these customer touch points (fancy marketer lingo for cus-
tomer contact).
The Order Confirmation page
I like to thank the customer for his order and provide useful customer service
info. This info reduces their stress, as well as the number of WISMO (where is
my order?) phone calls. Include answers to frequently asked customer ser-
vice questions. Let your customer know how long it will take to get his order
and how he can contact you.
58
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Merchants need to know about new orders, too! Depending on your Merchant
Solutions package, you can get notified by e-mail, in the Store Manager, and/or
by fax (Merchant Starter doesn’t include faxes). I prefer to get order e-mails
and faxes, but I’ll upgrade later for that.
To customize the Order Confirmation page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Order Form link under Order Settings.
Scroll down to the Order Confirmation message. The default message is
“Thank you for your order. Please print this page for your records.”
2. Add the text you want to the message.
For example, you can include “This is the Order Confirmation message
in Store Manager: Order Settings: Order Form.”
3. Click the Done button.
You’re back in the Store Manager. Later, I’ll can change my message to
something really good.
The Order Confirmation e-mail
The Shipment Status page is where you can turn on shipment tracking and
customer Order Confirmation e-mails, set a separate address to receive
bounced e-mail notifications, customize your Confirmation e-mail and Status
Update e-mails, and use the XML Update feature. I talk about all of these
topics a bit more in Chapter 15.
You should be on the Store Manager page. Here’s how to start sending and
customizing customer Order Confirmation e-mails:
1. Click the Shipment & Order Status link under Order Settings.
2. Type your e-mail address in the Order Confirmation e-mail field.
3. Scroll down to the Confirmation E-mail message and add the text
you’d like to appear.
The default message is “This email is to confirm the receipt of your
recent order from Yhst-YahooStoreAccount.”
4. Click the Update button.
You return to the Store Manager.
Auto–Order Notification e-mails
Here’s how to start receiving merchant automatic order notifications every
time you get an order:
59
Chapter 3: Jump-Starting Your Store

1. Click the Order E-mails link under Order Settings.
The Order System Settings page appears.
2. Type your e-mail address in the E-mail To field.
3. Click the Done button.
Publishing store settings changes 
and placing a test order
You can publish Order Settings by clicking the link. Go to the published site
by typing your domain name in your browser or by clicking the View Site link
in the Store Manager. Click around your new store. Place items in your
Shopping Cart and actually place a test order.
Note: Until you open for business (and complete said checklist — see the
next section), Yahoo! allows you to test orders. Your checkout works, but
says “yourdomain.com is not open for business. Ordering is allowed for
testing purposes only.”
Sometimes it takes a little while to publish a large site. Don’t try to go back to
the Store Editor while your store is publishing; your store is working. If you
try to publish more than five times, your store locks up, and it may take an
hour or more to unlock. You then see the error message “You have more 
than 5 pending requests.”
Opening for Business
After you’ve published the Store Editor, edited your privacy policy and info
pages, and published your store settings, you see two links in the Store Editor
in a message that says, “In order to open for business, you will need to com-
plete all of the items in the open for business checklist.” Here’s what you do:
1. Click the Open For Business link.
2. Fill in your merchant account bank’s name, phone number, and your
account number in the merchant account provider, provider phone
number, and account number fields.
3. Click the Submit button.
Next, you see the Congratulations Message.
60
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

4. Continue to Manager Console and publish your order settings.
Your site is now current and has met Y! requirements.
Any changes to the Order Settings require publishing. If you’re changing 17
things, wait until after you change the last thing to click the Publish Order
Settings link to make your changes live on the real store. When the live store
matches the Order Settings, the link disappears and is replaced with the
word Published.
Remember, you’re just getting started. As you build your store, you’re really
building your business. Don’t worry too much about making money at first.
Momentum is the main thing. Your store doesn’t have to be the best site on
the Web, it just needs to be on the Web. And soon!

Chapter 4
Anatomy of a Yahoo! Store Order
In This Chapter
 Examining the timeline of a real order
 Checking out the Shopping Cart and checkout order flow
 Keeping customers in the loop about orders and shipping
A
journey of a thousand miles starts with a single click: Add To Cart.
Nothing happens in e-commerce until a customer buys something. After
that happens, watch out! You’ve got orders to pick and pack, credit cards to
run, boxes to ship, and e-mails to send. Get this economy moving!
In this chapter, you get to see a real Yahoo! Store order from start to finish. I
show you everything that happens from the first click to the Web store all the
way through to the UPS truck pulling up to the customer’s house. Watch the
customer search on MSN, find my store in the search results pages, click my
search listing to jump to my Web store, browse various products, place an
order online, and discover everything else that happens behind the scenes to
get that box to the customer. You can find out a lot from watching how real
customers — not just browsers or tire-kickers — interact with your store.
The secret to getting more sales is to attract more visitors who act like 
customers.
As you follow this order, watch as I point out the major attractions. (On your
left, you notice the Shopping Cart. On your right, a secure checkout page.)
The story ends happily with a satisfied customer who got what he wanted
and a retailer who got an order and a brand new customer.
Examining the Timeline of a 
Real Yahoo! Store Order
This section gives you a timeline of an actual order placed in a real Yahoo!
Store. I changed the customer’s name and other personal info, but you can
still see where he went and what he bought. As I walk you down the virtual
shopping aisle, I point out features of the various elements of Yahoo! Store.

This overview includes the published pages of your Yahoo! Store; the
Shopping Cart; the secure checkout collecting shipping and billing informa-
tion; the order confirmation page and e-mail; and the tracking information
and stats you get when someone browses and buys.
Finding the store in a search engine
Figure 4-1 shows a search on http://search.msn.com for dog whistles.
Notice that the first result in the free listings in the MSN Search results is Gun
Dog Supply, one of my mom’s site. Not only did that #1 listing get a searcher
to click on the result, but that searcher also converted into a sale.
Search engine optimization is extremely important, and I talk a lot about that
in Chapter 19. In the search engine results pages, the link to the Web page
comes from the title tag of that page. On a Yahoo! Store, the title tag is usually
the text in the Name field. After the link is a snippet of text (also called the
abstract, but not to be confused with the Yahoo! Store Abstract field) that
comes from actual text on the Web page or from your Meta Description.
Figure 4-1:
MSN’s new
search
engine
reveals that
my page is
#1 out of

the phrase

whistles.
Guess it
was a good
day. . . .
64
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

The particular text in this example is from the breadcrumbs, the hierarchical
text link navigation at the top of every page that shows the section, subsec-
tion, and product page. This text is very search engine friendly, but you have
to customize your RTML templates to get these breadcrumbs to show up. I
talk more about RTML and custom templates in Chapter 26.
Landing on a section page
Figure 4-2 shows my section page for dog whistles that was listed #1 for dog
whistles in MSN. Notice that this section page contains both products and
subsections, which have a thumbnail and a text link to the product or subsec-
tion. This particular page has two paragraphs of text in the Caption field, and
the copy here is more for the customer than for search engines.
Note: This page uses custom RTML to display a tiny Order button on any
orderable products. This experiment has resulted in additional sales, but
having the Order button on section pages didn’t really move the needle on
increasing my conversion rate, so I dropped the little Order buttons for now.
Selling with a product page
Figure 4-3 shows a product page of the Acme Silent Dog Whistle. Product
pages usually have a picture of the product (image), a headline, and a prod-
uct description in the caption field, followed by the order functionality, which
includes code, price, sale price, any options (like size and color), and an Add
To Cart button.
Product pages are the most important type of page on your entire Web site.
You sell more when people can see the Add To Cart button on product pages
without having to scroll down. Bad product-page design kills more sales than
anything I know other than super-slow-loading Web sites.
Notice that the Add To Cart button or Order button is above the fold, which
means that you don’t have to scroll to see it as long as your monitor resolu-
tion is set to 800 x 600, 1,024 x 768, or higher. The phrase comes from the
newspaper industry, where above the fold means that the story or ad was
important enough to appear in the top half of the page, literally above the
fold in the middle of the paper.
Don’t put too much information in your Caption field, especially if you use
the factory preset templates. You need to have tons of online content (text
and images) about the product because the more you tell, the more you sell,
but long, long captions push the Order button way down the page.

Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

With custom RTML templates, you can move the Order button above the
Caption field so that it will always be above the fold. (Read more about RTML
in Chapter 26.) With standard templates, I recommend this workaround:
Create additional “More Info About The Product Name” pages. Place these
reviews, additional photos, and customer comments pages either inside the
product page itself (by putting the IDs in the Contents field like an accessory)
or by simply linking to the pages from within the Caption field of the product.
I talk a lot more about these topics in Chapters 11 and 12.
Use the following HTML code to link to additional information and content
pages inside your Caption field (after replacing the page names and product
names with real products). For more information on linking, check out the
site navigation tips in Chapter 7.
More info: See <a href=more-info-id.html>product name</a> details,<a href=more-
photos-id.html>product name photos</a>, and <a
href=customer-reviews-id.html>product name customer reviews</a>.
Pushing the Shopping Cart
Figure 4-4 shows the Shopping Cart after the customer clicks the Add To Cart
button on the Acme Silent Dog Whistle page. Anytime someone clicks the
Show Order button, he’s also sent to this page. The Shopping Cart shows a
thumbnail of the product’s image (linked to the page), the Name field (linked
to the page), the unit price, the quantity, any options selected, and a subtotal
for that line item.
Here’s what customers can do inside the Shopping Cart:
 The Update Quantity button lets you change the number in the quantity
field and update the Shopping Cart. 
 Clicking the Keep Shopping button takes you back to the previous page.
 Clicking the Check Out button leads to the Shipping Info page in the
Secure checkout.
The Shopping Cart always has the ID order, so it’s easy to find in the Store
Editor. (See Chapter 11 for more information.) You can link to your cart by
going to http://order.store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/wg-order?your
accountnamehere
You want the look of your cart to match the look of your site as best you can
so that the checkout process is seamless. I’ve seen solid increases in sales
when clients changed their Shopping Cart page to match their site’s look 
and feel. Read more about checking out the Shopping Cart in Chapter 14.
67
Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Yahoo! Store Order

I like to have as much control over the look and feel of my checkout as possi-
ble. By using custom RTML or the new Checkout Manager, my Shopping Cart
can match the look and feel of the rest of my store. I also add text where I
reassure the potential customer at the most critical time in the checkout
process.
For example, I say “Order on a secure server or call 1-800-624-6378. Your pri-
vacy is protected. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Risk-free 30-day money-back
guarantee. Most orders ship out the same business day. We appreciate your
business!” I show you everything I possibly can about how to make your site
easier to use and how to sell more stuff in Chapter 21.
Regardless of the cart you use, when a customer is ready to pay and clicks
the Check Out button, he’s sent to the checkout pages on the Yahoo! secure
servers. This is the first time in the order flow where the customer is on a
secure server. The Shopping Cart isn’t secure and doesn’t need to be. You
really only need a secure order form because that’s where the real action is
with personal information and credit cards.
You can always tell when you’re on a secure server because the URL starts
with https and a little lock icon appears in the lower right corner of your
browser.
Figure 4-4:
When you
click the
Add To Cart
button, you

in the
Shopping
Cart.
68
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Checking out the Secure Order form
On the secure Shipping Info page, the customer enters her name and ship-
ping address (including the country) and selects a shipping method. The
shipping rate is calculated based upon how you set up the shipping tables;
it’s usually based upon a combination of shipping method and shipping
address. Sales tax, if you collect it, is usually calculated based upon the 
location of the shopper using the zip code or state.
After typing the shipping information, the customer can click the Continue
button to move on to the Billing Info page or click the Cancel button to return
to the Shopping Cart.
Place a text message at the top of both the Shipping Info and Billing Info pages.
You don’t want to include a lot of text here because it will push the required
fields down the page. For more information on this topic, see Chapter 15.
Shipping Info page
Figure 4-5 shows the Shipping Info page, where the customer inputs address
and shipping method in the first page of the secure checkout. Notice the
https in the URL in the address bar of the browser, which tells you that
you’re on a secure server. This page shows a summary of the customer’s
order, displaying the item name and subtotal of the order before shipping 
and tax are calculated. When customers click the Continue button, shipping
and tax are calculated, and the Billing Info page appears.
If the customer forgets to fill out a field or types invalid information, Yahoo!
Store returns an error message in red with a red asterisk by the field to be
corrected. The customer can correct his error and click the Continue button
again.
Billing Info page
Figure 4-6 shows the Billing Info page, where the customer inputs payment
method, account number, and expiration date. The customer can also input
his billing address, unless it’s the same as the shipping address. E-mail
address, a ratings request checkbox, and the Comments field round out the
list of information I get from a customer.
At this point, the customer can either click the Cancel button to return to the
Shopping Cart or click the Place Order button to place the order and proceed
to the Order Confirmation page.
If you do real-time credit-card authorization, at this point the Yahoo! Store
secure server queries your Merchant Bank through the gateway and attempts
to get authorization for this credit-card sale. To get paid, you approve the
transaction and either force a batch or autobatch between 6 and 11 p.m. PST.
For more information on credit cards, see Chapter 15.
69
Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Yahoo! Store Order

If you process credit cards manually, then all the Yahoo! Store does here is
collect credit-card information, which you can later verify, authorize, and
charge.
Confirming orders and shipping ’em out
Figure 4-7 shows the Order Confirmation page, which is where you’re sent
when you click the Place Order button. This screen gives you the merchant’s
custom thanks message, your order number, and a link to your info page.
Almost instantly, a confirmation e-mail is sent to the customer’s e-mail
address that was entered on the Billing Info page. The retailer can also add
some text to this information with contact information and answers to fre-
quently asked questions.

Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 

Receiving order notifications
After a customer places an order, Yahoo! sends merchants an order notifica-
tion e-mail. To enable your merchant e-mail notifications, you must add your
e-mail address to the Fax/E-mail page under the Store Manager. This order
notification e-mail contains all the information the customer typed except
credit-card information, unless you opt for encrypted e-mails. The merchant
e-mail also shows the referrer, the entry page, and the converting keyword if
the customer’s order came from a search engine referral.
Figure 4-6:

Info page

information,

method and

71
Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Yahoo! Store Order

If you have fax notification turned on, you also get a fax about the same time.
In my warehouse, we use the faxes as pick tickets for the pickers and packers
to pull the orders. An order is picked from the warehouse and placed in a
box. The fax looks almost like the e-mail notification but does not have the
credit-card information.
Merchant Solutions Starter-level accounts don’t have the option to get faxes.
Processing orders
When you log in to the Store Manager, a red asterisk appears to the right of
the Orders link so that you know that you have a new, unviewed order. After
someone views that order, the red asterisk disappears.
Figure 4-8 shows the order as it appears in the Store Manager. You may have to
scroll down to see all the information, but the order shows all the customer

information, including shipping and billing information, what products the
customer ordered, method of payment, shipping method and rate, tax rate,
and more. The order also shows the referrer, the entry page, and the convert-
ing keyword if the customer’s order came from a search engine referral.
Orders in the Store Manager keep credit-card data for only four weeks for
security purposes. After that time, you can’t access your customer’s credit-
card information, so print or export your orders ASAP!
At this point, an invoice is printed and the box is sealed with tape, marked
with an order number, and placed in the shipping box line. Next, the day’s data
is exported from our POS software into the UPS WorldShip computer, where
each box is weighed, the address is verified, and a label is printed and stuck
on the box. UPS arrives about 4:30 p.m., and the box is on its way.
Taking care of details
Right before my UPS driver arrives to pick up my packages, I close out for the
day. The UPS WorldShip computer dials up the big UPS computer and
uploads the shipping data. Shortly thereafter, UPS sends e-mails from UPS to
our customers that contain their orders’ tracking number and anticipated
arrival date of the package.

73
Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Yahoo! Store Order

After an order has shipped, we send a personalized “Thanks For Your Order”
e-mail to each customer. Customers receive their orders anywhere from the
next day to a week later, depending on where they live and the shipping
method they chose. When customers sign for their order, a copy of their sig-
nature and delivery information is uploaded to the UPS Web site in case we
need to verify delivery.
A day or so after an order has been placed and all the stats in the Yahoo!
Store have been updated, you can actually see the path a customer took as
she placed an order by looking at the Click Trails (in the Store Manager under
Statistics). I talk a lot about this feature in Chapter 20.
74
Part I: Finding Out about Yahoo! Store 
Order status e-mail
Yahoo! Store gives retailers the option of send-
ing order status e-mails to let customers know
that their orders are partially shipped, on back
order, or shipped entirely. When you change a
customer’s order status, Yahoo! makes a note
on the order and sends an e-mail to the cus-
tomer. If you paste the tracking number into the
order, this information is included in your order
status e-mails.
I don’t use order status e-mails because most of
my orders ship the same business day. Before I
have a chance to send an order status e-mail,
I’m usually sending a tracking number e-mail.

Part II
Planning What’s
in Store

In this part . . .
I
’m a big believer in planning your store before building
your store. If I don’t plan, I end up having to redo most
of the work two or three times, searching for what I want.
Even when I think I know exactly what I want in my head, I
still sketch a quick design on paper before I start building
anything!
In this part, I talk about getting everything ready before
you begin store building. You can read about choosing
a store-building tool (Pick the Editor! Pick the Editor!),
explore whether you should build a store yourself or hire
an expert to do it (Do both. Trust me, I explain!), and
make a list of all the different design elements that make
a store look like a store.
I also talk about what makes a good store design and why
that subject is so very subjective. My definition of good
store design is anything that increases store sales because
that’s extremely measurable and objective. Anything else
is an opinion.
This part also covers store navigation. You can see how
customers really shop online by searching your store, 
navigating with buttons and links, and clicking featured
products and specials. I also address how you can design
your store to make it easier for your customers to find
exactly what they’re looking for so that they will buy
more stuff.

Chapter 5
Preparing to Build 
Your Yahoo! Store
In This Chapter
 Choosing a store-building method: Store Editor or Web hosting with Store Tags
 Building what parts you can and outsourcing the rest
 Assembling all the elements you need before you get started
I
n this chapter, I tell you about two different ways to build your store: Store
Editor and Web hosting with Store Tags. Choosing which way to build your
Yahoo! Store determines how you maintain your store on a daily basis. You
need to examine your options so that you can decide which way is best.
I also discuss the skills you need to build an online store. Take a good look at
what you can do, what you can find out how to do, and what you need to hire
someone else to do.
Finally, I lay out my list of the assets and elements you need to get together
so that you have everything you need before you start store building.
Choosing a Store-Building Tool
You can build a Yahoo! Store in two very different ways: Store Editor and Store
Tags. They are different faces for the same product database. With the default
settings, Editor-built pages exist at http://store.yourdomain.com, while
Store Tags are put inside HTML pages in your Web-hosting account at www.
yourdomain.com. You get to choose where you point your www, and I prefer
to have my Editor-built pages at the www.mydomain.com address. I show you
how to point your domain and lots more in Chapter 24.

Store Editor
With Store Editor, you don’t need any special software or Web-development
skills. You simply build your store online using your Web browser and the
Store Editor online software. Figure 5-1 shows the home page in edit mode.
As you add products, the Store Editor automatically creates Web pages for
you. With Store Editor, your products are the pages. Editing the page for a
product is the same as editing the product.
Store Editor requires no Web-development skills or special software. Nope.
None. All you need is an Internet access and a Web browser. Store Editor may
be for you if:
 You prefer to be able to work on your store from any computer, anywhere
in the world with an Internet connection. All you have to do is log in and
start working. All your work is stored on Yahoo!, not on your desktop
computer.
 You have employees who maintain your online store.
 You have lots of products (more than 50), or products with lots of
changes.

78
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

This book is about store building with Store Editor. The Store Editor is easy
to use, but it’s also powerful.
Store Tags
Store Tags are a little different because you put Store Tags inside HTML pages
you create with software such as SiteBuilder, Dreamweaver, or another HTML
editor. Store Tags are magical bits of HTML code that you insert into your
product pages hosted on your Web-hosting account. These snippets of code
pull information from your product database so that changes to prices or
descriptions in your product catalog are automatically updated in your Web
pages. With Store Tags, you use Catalog Manager to create and maintain your
product catalog, and you build and upload your Web pages using the HTML
editor of your choice. With Store Tags pages, you have to manually update
your category and section pages when you make additions or edits to your
product catalog.
Store Tags require using additional software such as SiteBuilder (no HTML
required) or professional HTML design software (like Dreamweaver), which
makes my head hurt. Make anything other than a price change, and you, a
skilled employee, or an outside firm has to edit and upload your edited HTML
pages to your Web-hosting account.
Store building via Web hosting with Store Tags may be for you if:
 You already have a Web-hosting account and just want to add a Shopping
Cart. Just upgrade your account, plug in some code, and you have an
online store.
 You’re a retailer who has few products, and they change rarely.

Chapter 5: Preparing to Build Your Yahoo! Store
Why I prefer Store Editor
When it comes to deciding what’s better for you,
I’m biased. No bones about it. When it comes to
store building and maintenance, I am com-
pletely biased toward Store Editor. Here’s why:
My mom can use the Yahoo! Store Editor, but
she can’t use Merchant Solutions Store Tags to
save her life.
Most retailers are smart, independent, and
overwhelmed with work. They have no desire to
be a computer geek or Web developer. The
whole point of Viaweb (now Yahoo! Store) was
“no developer required.”

 You have larger corporate clients who need their pages to meet their
marketing’s branding design specifications.
 You have an ad agency or a Web-development firm developing your
pages, and they’re used to traditional Web-design methods or if your
main Web designer is an HTML whiz.
Building a Store Yourself 
or Outsourcing It
You can build your store yourself, or you can hire someone to build it for 
you. You can even build it yourself and then just hire someone to clean it up.
Sometimes, though, it’s just better to break out the checkbook or the credit
card and bite the bullet. It all depends on how much free time you have, how
valuable your time is, and whether you want to spend your time learning store
design and development if you’re only developing one store. If you’re starting
out like I did with literally no budget, just dive in and fake it ’til you make it.
Doing it yourself
Building an online business requires ability in several completely different
arenas: graphic design, programming, database development, Web design,
80
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 
Choosing a store-building method: Another opinion
When it comes to picking a store-building tool
and using it, my good friend (and technical
reviewer of this book) Michael Whitaker of
Monitus.com sums up his philosophy:
 Just because Web hosting with Store Tags
is the new kid on block, don’t assume that it
is the better way to build your store. Many
of the more successful and active Yahoo!
Stores are built with the editor, but which
store-building method you pick is depen-
dent on your particular circumstances;
carefully consider which features are
important to you before you go charging off
building your store. I personally still feel that
building and maintaining your store with the
Editor is easier for many merchants.
 After you have chosen your store-building
tool, you should stick with it. If you use the
Store Editor, create and manage products
only in the Store Editor, and don’t use the
Catalog Manager. Conversely, if you use
Web hosting with Store Tags, then only use
the Catalog Manager to create and main-
tain your product catalog.

copywriting, photography, and online marketing. You don’t have to be an
expert in all of them, but it helps to have a wide range of ability.
Make a list of your available skills as well as which skills you can learn. When
you have a choice between learning a skill that will directly translate into
making more money or learning a skill that will let you do cool stuff on the
Web, make a careful choice. Decide how much time you really want to devote
to learning and doing things that really don’t help you sell more products. Do
you want to be a retailer, or do you want to be a Web developer? The highest
and best use of your time probably isn’t learning the ins and outs of RTML, but
taking care of customers, finding new products, and promoting your business.
Even if you do decide to hire someone to build your Yahoo! Store, I still rec-
ommend building a test store on your own just for the experience you’ll gain.
Because you’ll probably maintain your own store and create and edit prod-
ucts in the Store Editor, you’ll need to become familiar with using the Editor.
When you get in there and poke around, you’ll see that the Store Editor isn’t
so scary after all, even in Advanced mode. (I show you everything you need
to know in Chapter 9.)
Outsourcing it
Anything you can do on or to a Yahoo! Store can be delegated or outsourced.
You can hire folks to design your store from the ground up, create a custom
logo, develop a corporate identity with unique colors and fonts, build your
store product database, take product photos, write sales copy, perform
search engine optimization on your site, custom-build RTML templates that
do almost anything you want them to do, and even manage your orders and
perform customer service. It all depends on your budget.
After you’ve decided that you need help, you have lots of choices to make.
The first decision is the size of your budget, which determines who you can
hire. I’ve seen prices for “building a Yahoo! Store” range anywhere from $300
to $20,000 and up. You can get a bargain using offshore designers (working
anywhere from eastern Europe to India), college kids, or even professional
designers moonlighting out of their basement. If you want a more “profes-
sional” experience, expect to pay up to $20,000 for a complete branding, 
marketing, and design package from top-drawer advertising agencies.
You get what you pay for. Most of the facelifts and site redesigns I see from the
good design companies run between $2,000 to $3,000. When you get a facelift,
sometimes the results are more than just superficial. Some designers improve
the shopping experience, which can dramatically increase sales from your
81
Chapter 5: Preparing to Build Your Yahoo! Store

existing traffic by increasing your conversion rate (see Chapter 21). Also,
many facelifts improve the way your site looks to search-engine spiders, too!
For more on search engine optimization, see Chapter 19.
After you know what store building you can do and what you can’t do or
would rather not do, you’re ready to look for some help with the heavy lift-
ing. First, you have to decide what type of vendor you want to work with
because there’s a big difference between working with a freelancer or inde-
pendent consultant and working with a large design company or ad agency:
 Advertising agencies and the bigger design firms have more resources,
such as programmers, graphic designers, and Internet marketing consul-
tants, all on staff. With a large design company, you never know exactly
who’s going to be working on your project. The designer you liked so
much in the portfolio may no longer even work there. Depending on how
much you pay, your project may be assigned to a junior-level designer or
an intern. Unless you’re a major project for the design firm, you proba-
bly won’t be working with one of the principals of the company, but
more likely an account rep, also known as a project manager.
Ask the right questions (such as who did the graphics on this site or the
SEO on that site), and you’ll get better access to the talent. Be a smart
shopper for design services.
 You can find great smaller consultancies and freelancers if you can be
flexible. When you hire an individual, you have a pretty good idea of
the level of work that you’ll get based on his portfolio. Remember that
smaller firms and one-man-bands don’t have the resources or organiza-
tional structure of a larger corporate firm, so you may have a more
slightly relaxed working environment. Freelancers tend to come and go
as they please, and working hours aren’t usually 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Many independent consultants try to be all things to all people. No one
can be great at everything. Make sure that whomever you hire special-
izes in exactly what you need.
Figure 5-2 shows the Yahoo! Store Developer Network. Yahoo! provides you
with a list of designers, developers, programmers, and marketers who are (at
worst) familiar with Yahoo! Store and Merchant Solutions and who have built
at least three or more Yahoo! Stores. Yahoo! doesn’t officially endorse the
companies on the list, but (in my humble opinion) the directory is a very
good representation of most of the world’s top Yahoo! Store design talent.

Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

Gathering Elements and Assets
Whether you’re building your store yourself or you’re hiring a designer, you
need more than just a logo and some product information to make a store.
You need all the different design elements that make your store look like a
store and not just another Web site. These elements include all your com-
pany’s customer-service information and policies, HTML code for third-party
software applications, a site map of what pages go where, and tons of little
bitty things that no one ever thinks about until she starts to build a store. In
this section, I give you a quick overview of the elements and assets you need
to assemble before you start to build your Yahoo! Store.
Product data
Product information is what most people think about when they’re getting
ready to build a Yahoo! Store. Of course, you need a product database that
includes the product name, code, price, sale price, and description. You also

list of

Y!Stores.
83
Chapter 5: Preparing to Build Your Yahoo! Store

need individual product images. Don’t forget such information as competing
or more expensive or better suited products for up-selling, related products
and accessories that you can use in the cross-sell database, and alternate
sections and other ways of merchandising your products. (See Chapter 12 for
more information on creating products.)
You also need to decide what products go where. Building a rough site map
on paper can help you. I like to organize my stores into as many as seven
major categories with no more than ten subcategories per section. If more
than 20 products are in a subcategory, I break that subcategory into multiple
subcategories. (See Chapter 7 for store navigation tips and tricks.)
Design elements
Often, it’s the little things that make a store look like a store. Everything from
credit-card icons to Add To Cart buttons shows your customer that your
Web site is a Web store. Figure 5-3 shows a product page with several design
elements.

things that

84
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

Here are the finishing touches to make your store look more real:
 Logos and corporate identity: You need multiple versions of your logo
in Web-friendly file formats, preferably high-resolution .gif files. If you
already have your corporate identity (colors and fonts) designed, your
store designer needs to know your official colors and fonts. If you don’t
have a corporate identity (a fancy name for a logo and other branding 
elements), you can get one designed for you. Search on Yahoo! for logo
design or corporate identity and be prepared to pay anything from $100
on up, depending on the quality of the designer.
 Unique company graphics: Usually, many other sites sell exactly the
same thing that you sell. You have to do something to differentiate your
store from all the copycat stores that are simply using the manufactur-
ers’ images and text. Collect any unique company graphics, images, or
photos that help make your store look different from all the companies
selling exactly the same thing.
 Icons and buttons: If you hire a store designer, she usually creates these
elements, but it helps to know in advance that you’ll need these buttons,
bars, and icons. Poke around on the Web and find buttons and icons that
you like. Find Search, Add To Cart, Show Cart, Info, E-Mail Us, and other
cool icons that make a Web store look polished and professional.
 Company logos and bugs: Collect various logos and graphic bugs (tiny
versions of logo graphics) from all the different suppliers, manufactur-
ers, and industry trade associations you belong to, as well as of any con-
sumer protection organizations that endorse your site. Trust symbols
like Better Business Bureau seals and TrustE help make customers feel
more comfortable shopping online. Contact your shipping company for
official UPS, FedEx, and USPS logos. Your merchant account bank can
provide you with credit-card logos such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
and American Express. If you accept PayPal payments, grab that logo,
too. Most companies can send you these graphics or offer them on their
Web site for your convenience.
 Yahoo! branding: Having Yahoo! Store branding somewhere on your
site is a good thing because you’re using the Yahoo! Store secure check-
out. See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/aboutms/
aboutms-29.html for cool new revised badges that say Hosted by
Yahoo! and ecommerce by Yahoo! I also like to have a secure server icon
showing on the product pages, and definitely in the Shopping Cart and
on the checkout pages.
 Manufacturer images: Manufacturers are really good about letting you
use their logo on your Web store. Nonetheless, make sure that you get
permission before you use any photography or other promotional
85
Chapter 5: Preparing to Build Your Yahoo! Store

graphics off their Web sites because sometimes the manufacturers don’t
actually own these images.
 Promotional images: You need to create special promotional graphics
if you have special offers like free shipping or 100 percent satisfaction
guaranteed. You’ll also want banners and micro-banners for the sites
you sponsor or for folks who just want a link to you.
 Candid photography: Pictures of your store location or warehouse go a
long way in establishing the fact that you’re a credible business. If you
work out of your house, use images of your work area with boxes and
packing materials to show that you actually ship the things you sell. If
you use a fulfillment center or a drop-shipper, see whether you can use
photos of its location for added credibility. Pictures of you and your staff
help humanize your company. Sometimes less-than-professional photog-
raphy makes you look more real and less plastic.
It’s okay to be a small company on the Web. Lots of folks like the fact that
they get to deal with the owner of a company when shopping with a small
business. Face it. Do you think Jeff Bezos packs every box at Amazon.com?
If you have photographs of people using the things you sell, use them on
your Web site as long as you have permission. You don’t have to have profes-
sional models to have good photographs.
Copywriting
Besides having great product descriptions in your Caption fields, you’ll also
need the normal pages every Web site has: your home page’s intro copy, an
About Us page, and good descriptions for your section pages.
Here is a good list of copywriting stuff you need to write for your site, includ-
ing snippets, pages, policies, and other words:
 Product availability: You need a standard line about product availability
on regular products. I like using “most orders shipped the same busi-
ness day” when that is true. For out-of-stock, special order, or drop-ship
items, it’s also good to have a standard availability line such as “usually
ships in four to five business days.”
 Contact us: You need to collect your full contact information and your
satisfaction guarantee, if you offer one — and you should!
 Ordering information: In your ordering info, include multiple ways to
order: Internet, phone, fax, and mail; the credit cards you accept; and
pricing information, including whether you wholesale or offer discounts
on quantity pricing and the fact that prices may change without notice.
86
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

 Shipping information: In your shipping info, include which shipping 
carriers you use, the different shipping methods and rates, the cost and
estimated delivery time of Express shipping, free shipping, and interna-
tional shipping options, as well as what to do with returns and damaged
packages.
 Legal stuff: I’m not a lawyer, but it would be smart to have your site’s
terms of use, trademark and copyright information, and privacy policy
all over the site. Ask your favorite barrister.
 About Us: For the Company or About Us section, I like a Welcome To
The Store letter, a page about your company’s history, bios of the princi-
pals or owners, and customer testimonials.
 Additional article: For additional content, write articles about how to
use the products you sell, create buyers’ guides about all the different
features and benefits of the different types of products you sell, and pre-
pare a bestsellers list.
 Search-engine copywriting: For search engine optimization, the first
thing you need is a keyword list of the top 200 keywords you want to
rank well for. I talk a lot more about this topic in Chapter 16. For each
section page and product page, you want to make sure that you have
keywords in the name field (which creates the page title or title tag), a
list of specific keywords around 18 to 36 words long, a 10- to 20-word
keyword-loaded description of the page for the meta description, and
great product and section descriptions in the Captions field.
 HTML code: If you use any third-party tracking solutions or e-mail ser-
vices such as newsletters or E-Mail This Page To A Friend, you need the
custom HTML code for those items as well. I also grab the HTML for
Yahoo! Store functionality, including links to the cart, info page, privacy
policy, and home page.

Designing Your Store to Turn
Shoppers into Buyers
In This Chapter
 Designing a store to meet your online retailing goals
 Exploring what is and isn’t “good” design (Hint: “good” design sells more)
 Choosing colors, fonts, and page layouts for a better look and feel
S
tore design matters. Contrary to what your mother may have told you,
people do judge by appearance. Your potential customers scrutinize your
store design whether they’re conscious of it or not. Every element of your
Yahoo! Store from your company logo, colors and fonts, and quality of your
product photography to the checkout flow tells potential customers about
your company and influences their decision whether to buy something.
Just because a Web store looks professional doesn’t mean that it is profes-
sional, but that doesn’t stop your potential customers from making assump-
tions about you and your company based upon the quality of your store’s
design.
A well-designed store converts more shoppers into buyers with sales that
result in happy repeat customers. That’s it. I don’t think there’s really any-
thing more important in e-commerce.
In this chapter, I explore the best practices of store design, push the design
limits of standard Store Editor templates, examine various design elements,
and help you create a professional-looking Yahoo! Store.
Designing Your Store to Sell
Your first design decision should be to determine what you want out of your
Yahoo! Store. Are you looking to create a design masterpiece, an online retail
money machine, or both? Here’s my opinion about why you shouldn’t have
an opinion on store design until you see the sales numbers:

 Good design sells. A well-designed Web store communicates the value of
the products you sell. Good design also underscores the professionalism
of the company behind the products. Good design tends to give shoppers
confidence in a retailer’s ability to deliver and goes a long way toward
increasing the likelihood that you’ll convert a browser into a buyer.
 A lack of design costs you customers, maybe forever! It’s too easy for
shoppers to click the Back button and find 100 other retailers who sell
exactly what you sell. It may be cliché, but my grandmother, Mimi, was
right: You really don’t get a second chance to make a first impression.
 When potential customers look at your store, the emphasis should be
on the products and the benefits of buying them, not on how cool
your Shopping Cart or logo is. The store is the frame, not the picture. I
want customers to say, “Man! That product is exactly what I’m looking
for. I’m ordering mine right now!” — not “What a cool-looking Web page.
I love the site design. Who did that?”
 When customers are less aware that they’re being sold, the more they
will buy. By all means, romance and charm your customers as you edu-
cate them about what you sell, but the last thing I want you to do is say,
“Now I’m about to romance and charm you.” (That approach doesn’t
work so well when you’re dating, either!) If you mislead customers, or
exaggerate, or simply dump a bunch of hooey on them, you’ll be out of
business faster than Boo.com after the tech bubble burst.
 People have strong opinions on what constitutes “good” design. Rules
abound regarding composition, use of color, contrast, balance, and har-
mony, but most opinions about design are just that: opinions. My opin-
ions about effective store design are based upon how well the design
helps me achieve the goals of my Web site (sell more stuff), not how
much my girlfriend likes the pictures, logo, and navigation buttons.
90
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 
Sometimes ugly Web sites have 
beautiful bottom lines
I’ve always heard and read that “ugly” Web
design outsells “pretty” design. I was attending
an affiliate marketing conference and was for-
tunate enough to eat lunch with one of the bril-
liant marketers who sold millions and millions of
dollars of those X-10 spy cameras via pop-under
banners. He told me that he thought the simple
HTML Web pages sold better because they
loaded faster than graphics-heavy pages. Basic
HTML pages looked more like information
pages from the early days of the Web and less
like slick sales presentations. Regardless of
why they converted better, simpler pages out-
performed super-slick designs, so he stuck with
what worked. This guy was always testing var-
ious design elements to maximize his results.

You can have an opinion on whether a store’s design is good or professional,
but there’s no opinion on whether a change in design increased store sales.
Numbers don’t flatter or lie. Sales either go up or they don’t. For the rest of
this book, when I write good design, I mean anything that increases sales. Bad
design is anything that doesn’t increase sales or (gasp!) makes sales go down.
Looking through the Eyes of a Customer
Very simply, good design is about making conscious decisions about how
the various elements of your store work together to create a positive online
shopping experience by meeting the expectations of your target customers.
The design of your store is affected by many factors, but perhaps the most
important factor is how customers view your store. Build your store with the
average customer’s experience in mind. It is so much easier to build a better
store when you see exactly what your customers see.
Before you start building your store, know your typical customers’ Internet
access speed, operating system, browser software and version, and monitor
screen resolution (the height and width settings in pixels). For example, if you
sell reconditioned Sun servers and workstations to Fortune 500 IT department
heads, your customers will have a different Web experience than customers of
a NASCAR collectibles shop.
Here are three important design requirements:
 Design pages to load quickly. When pages download within 10 to 12 sec-
onds per page for folks on dialup, the pages really fly on a broadband
connection.
 Make your store fit the two most common screen resolutions: 1,040 x
768 and 800 x 600 pixels. You’ll be safe if your store isn’t more than 800
pixels wide.
 Design your store using Microsoft Internet Explorer. Most customers
view my stores on the latest version of IE, but you still need to make
sure that it looks good on AOL and the Firefox browser, too.
I talk a lot more about making your store easier to use in Chapter 21.
Choosing Logos, Colors, and Fonts
I don’t think I can explain the intricacies of creating a viable corporate iden-
tity by branding through the use of logos, colors, fonts, and images in a single
chapter, much less an entire book, but I am going to give you the keys to the
kingdom for good store design.
91
Chapter 6: Designing Your Store to Turn Shoppers into Buyers

Looking at logos
When you’re in business, your logo represents your company more than any
other single element. In the customer’s mind, a professional logo equals a
professional company. There’s nothing that ruins a well-designed Web store
faster than topping it with an illegible, unprofessional-looking logo.
You cannot afford to skimp on your logo. Hire a pro and spend what it takes
to get a professional logo.
Your logo should be a distinctive color and font so that it stands out. Your
logo also should match the look of your industry. It needs to look good and
be legible in many different formats, locations, and sizes. Logos need to look
good in color and in black-and-white. Logos need to be legible at any size: on
your business card, plastered on the Goodyear blimp, or anywhere else your
name could go.
Figure 6-1 shows a logo uploaded to the Name-image field (under Variables),
which appears at the top of every page as a header graphic and also serves
as a clickable link to the home page. I like to display my logo in the footer of
every page, too, using the Final-text field (under Variables), where you can
put HTML to call that image. See Chapter 8 for more info on images.
92
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 
Mimic magazines
My good friend, Craig Paddock, Internet mar-
keting consultant, gave me this design secret,
which, by itself, is worth the price of this book:
Design your store to match the look and feel of
the magazines your customers read about the
products you sell. What genius!
The best magazine designers have spent thou-
sands of hours crafting a design that fits that
specific industry and appeals to that specific
demographic. Look at the magazine’s colors,
fonts, formatting of images, and even the tone
of the writing to get ideas for your Web store.
You don’t have to literally copy a magazine’s
design, just emulate the flavor.
Look at the ads. Manufacturers spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars hiring the best 
photographers, graphic designers, and illustra-
tors. Keep a file folder where you tear out vari-
ous graphic elements you like.
For example, if you sell skincare products to
women, your online store needs to have the
production values of Cosmopolitan or O, The
Oprah Magazine. When you sell home and
garden products, your Yahoo! Store better look
more like Southern Living or Better Homes and
Gardens. If you sell contemporary designer fur-
niture, take a look at Metropolitan magazine.
Make sure that your stores look like the right
magazine for its industry and not the latest cut-
ting-edge skate punk ’zine.

Compelling use of color
Here are several concepts about color for your consideration:
 Be consistent with the use of colors and fonts. Use the same branding
across your entire Web site and all other collateral materials, including
your packaging, catalogs, brochures, business cards, letterhead, and
anything else you send to vendors or customers.
 Pick one dominant color and a secondary accent color. These colors
need to match your logo or complement your existing logo. Use these
two colors across the store in your site navigation, links, site decoration,
accents, icons, navigation buttons, headlines, and more.

Chapter 6: Designing Your Store to Turn Shoppers into Buyers
How to get ideas for colors
If you don’t have colors for your Web site, a
great way to get ideas for your colors is to go to
the supermarket and collect packaging of prod-
ucts you like, especially products that match
your industry. Packaging designers are brilliant
at capturing and communicating the essence of
a product and motivating you to buy it.
Another way to gather ideas for colors is to col-
lect photographs you like. When I find a great
photograph, I scan a copy into my graphics pro-
gram. I reduce the image dimensions to a
micro-thumbnail about 10 pixels wide, which
gives me a tiny palette of the most popular
colors in that image.

 Make sure that your corporate colors are high-contrast enough to look
good in black-and-white. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of males and
0.5% of females are somewhat color blind, so you’re looking at a pretty
decent-sized portion of shoppers. If your design looks good in black-and-
white, most people who are color blind will be able to read it.
If you already have a logo or a corporate identity designed, you probably
already know your site’s colors in RGB. For example, one of my sites is red
(255 0 0), white (255 255 255), black (0 0 0), and gray (102 102 102). RGB
stands for red green blue. These numbers, which range from 0 to 255, tell
your monitor how much to display of each of the three colors. For example,
white (255 255 255) is made up of red, green, and blue at 100%. To display
black (0 0 0), your monitor displays no red, green, or blue.
Picking colors on the Variables page
Changing colors on a Yahoo! Store is really easy. When you click the Variables
button in the Store Editor, a page displays all the global variables of your entire
Yahoo! Store. Many of these variables are colors. For example, the third vari-
able is Background-color. Next to the name of the color is a color swatch show-
ing you the color, a field with the RGB number of the color, and a Choose A
Color link.
To change a color, type the RGB color code in the field or click the Choose A
Color link, and a color pop-up window with Web-safe colors appears. When
you click a color, the window closes, and the RGB number appears in the field
next to a color swatch to show that you picked the right color.
Display text uses the vw-img text tag
Figure 6-2 shows how the Store Editor autogenerates good-looking text. It
turns text into an image, drawing a picture of the text using the fonts you pick
in Variables. Display text looks better than regular HTML text, but I’ll give up
pretty text for “ugly” HTML to make my site more search-engine-friendly.
94
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 
Sizing up customers’ monitors
Pixels are the dots that make up your screen
and are the linear unit of measure for the Web.
Each pixel can represent over 16 million colors
(256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216) by turning up and
down different combinations of red, blue, and
green light.
The height and width of images are measured
in pixels. Pixels display at different sizes on dif-
ferent monitors, depending on the size of the
monitor as well as the screen resolution set-
tings of the computer. Most folks have their
monitors set at 600 x 800 or 1,024 x 768, which
means your Yahoo! Store should be no wider
than 800 pixels to look right on most monitors. I
talk a lot more about screen resolution, load
speed, usability issues, and other geeky things
in Chapter 21.

Here’s the code to make vw-img text:
<vw-img text=”your text here” font=OCR-B. font-size=24
text-color=”#000000”>
If you get any amount of search-engine traffic, look into getting around using
the vw-img text tag and use CSS to format text. Your text looks pretty, but
search engines can still read it.
Finding fantastic fonts
Here are several guidelines for using fonts:
 Use a standard Web-friendly typeface. Use the same font consistently
across your Web site. Set the variable Text-font to Arial, Verdana, Times,
or Georgia.
 Pick a body copy font size that’s easy to read. I prefer to set the variable
Text-size to 2 (the default) or 3. Be very aware of the age of your average
customer. As we get older, smaller fonts are much, much harder to read.
When your customers need larger fonts, they usually have larger wallets
with more expendable income.
I used to tease my mom about setting all her 21-inch monitors in a lower-
resolution “Granny-mode” (800 x 600), which super-sized her screen fonts.
It sure made her screen easier to read. After 15 years of staring at moni-
tors all day long, I think she’s about to get the last laugh, because I’ll be
wearing bifocals sooner than not!

Chapter 6: Designing Your Store to Turn Shoppers into Buyers

 It’s easier to read dark text on a very light background. I prefer black
text on a white background with absolutely no background image to
obscure the text. The variable Text-color defaults to black (0 0 0), but
please, please, please use a dark-color text on a white background! I talk
a lot more about making your site easier to use in Chapter 21.
The Store Editor gives you 117 fonts to choose from, but only some fonts are
good for navigation bars. Figure 6-3 shows the fonts I like. Pick a font that’s
easy to read at a small size. Narrower fonts work better because they don’t
take up as much room. For design consistency, pick a font in the same font
family as the Display-text. I made a page that shows all 117 supported fonts 
in all their glory: See www.ystorebooks.com/all-fonts.html.

Logos are more important than you realize
Manufacturers spend millions of dollars each
year promoting their brand, which is associated
with a logo. I found out last year exactly how
much credibility logos give your site. To
increase the load speed of one of my sites, I
removed ten manufacturer logos from the
header of the Yahoo! Store. Sales dropped by
half, but it took me about 12 hours to notice it.
When I did, I immediately put the logos back on
the site, and sales jumped right back up.
You can upload manufacturer logos to individ-
ual product pages by using the Inset image field,
but unfortunately, you have to upload these
insets by hand. An alternative is to upload one
manufacturer logo to your images folder and
then use HTML to call that image with an image
source tag in your Caption. Here are two differ-
ent paths to an image:
<img src=/lib/youraccountname/
logo.gif>
<img src=http://site.
ystorebooks.com/images/
logo.gif>
I also recommend putting micro-icons or very
small manufacturer logos that link to the manu-
facturer’s page in your stores header, Final-text,
or sidebar navigation.

Exploring Store Navigation
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how shoppers navigate
 Exploring the Editor’s navigational elements
 Using Site Search for better navigation
 Optimizing your store with simple text links
 Introducing advanced navigation with RTML
W
ell-designed store navigation is crucial for the success of your online
store. Most shoppers don’t enter your store through the home page.
They enter your store sideways and land on a product or section page. If you
want a prospective customer to find what she is looking for, the navigation
needs to show who you are, where she is in your store, and where she can go
from this page.
Folks navigate stores by clicking featured products; by browsing your store’s
hierarchy of sections, subsections, and products; or by using your site’s
search engine to find information.
In this chapter, I cover the different ways shoppers navigate your store, intro-
duce navigational elements, and explain how the Store Editor automatically
creates most of these items for you. I also show you how to add text links and
introduce some cool things you can do (or hire someone to do!) with advanced
RTML templates to max out your store’s navigation.
Introducing Store Navigation
Store navigation really comes down to communicating two things:
 This is where you are.
 Here’s what you can do.

Make it really easy to get around on your site by showing shoppers where
they are now and where they can go from here. Improve store navigation by
removing anything that gets in the way of shopping.
Seeing how customers shop
Figure 7-1 shows a detail of a click trail. If you want to see how individual cus-
tomers navigate your store, look at Click Trails under Statistics in the Store
Manager, which shows you the path or click trail of specific customers.
(Merchant Starter accounts don’t get to see Click Trails, and if that’s what
you’re using, you need to upgrade to use this feature.) Pay attention to users
who place an order. You’ll see how they page back and forth between similar
products, read your Info page, add and remove items from their carts, and
then finally place an order. You can discover a lot about how shoppers navi-
gate your site by diving into the click trails.
Take a look at every page and ask yourself what you want customers to do on
this page, and then make sure that they can easily do it! I talk about making
your site easier to use in Chapter 21.
Use every navigational tool at your disposal to make it easy for your cus-
tomers to shop:
 Have a consistent navigation scheme across your entire store. Stores
built with the Editor using standard templates have navigation buttons
across the top or down the side that link to the top-level sections and
buttons that link to built-in store functions.
 Display your company logo on every page and link it to the home
page. The Store Editor automatically displays your logo on every page
when you upload your logo to the variable Home-image. You get two fea-
tures for the price of one: branding and navigation. You can also use the
Figure 7-1:

Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

variable Name-image. Upload an image (preferably a 100-pixel-tall x 650-
pixel-wide graphic) as a header to brand pages. The Name-image also
links to your home page.
 Link to your Shopping Cart on every page with the Show-order button.
I prefer a link to the cart to be in the upper right corner, which can be by
using RTML or by sticking some HTML code in the Head-tags field on the
Variables page.
 Link to your Info page on every page with the Info button. Use the Info
button as well as links to Info, Contact Us, Information, and any other
utility pages in the footer of every page. Use the variable Final-text for
these links.
 Flatten your site. The deeper your site is, the more levels you have, and
the more clicks it takes for your customers to find what they want. Don’t
bury pages too deep in your site. I try to limit my sites to five levels of
pages at the most.
 Separate the shopping pages from the customer care and content
pages. Group related merchandise together. Focus on five to seven major
product categories. Feature your most popular items on a bestsellers’
category page. Make a separate content section. Include articles like
Buyer’s Guides, product Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and other
product-related content. Create a Customer Care section with links to
About Us, Contact Us, Shipping Information, Terms & Conditions, FAQs,
Link/Resources, and any other customer service information that’s
important, but doesn’t need to be mixed in with the items you sell.
 Call navigational elements what they really are and be consistent! For
example, the default text for the button that add items to your Shopping
Cart is Order and is determined by whatever text is inside the Order-text
field under Variables. To see what’s inside your cart, you click the Show-
order button, and the text on this button comes from whatever text is
inside the Show-order-text field under Variables.
Change the text to Add To My Cart or Show My Cart, which sounds like
less of a commitment than Order or Buy. I also think the word my gives
ownership to the cart. Before the potential customer got to the product
page, she probably didn’t even know she had a Shopping Cart on your
site. Now she does!
You are here: Store Editor 
navigational elements
Navigational elements are the text and images that tell you where you are on 
a Web site and help you navigate from one page to another. Figure 7-2 shows
you that the Store Editor is really just a collection of built-in navigational ele-
ments that you wrap around the products and sections of your store.
99
Chapter 7: Exploring Store Navigation

Here’s what you see in the Store Editor:
 Your domain name is branded across the top of every page in your
store. This Banner-Text displays the text from the variable Title and
links to your home page.
 The name of each page shows at the top of each page. If you use the
Headline field, it replaces the name. Display-font, Display-font-size, and
Display-text-color variables control how the text looks. The name is also
used as the <Title> tag, which appears in the left-uppermost corner of
your browser’s window.
 Navigation buttons exist for all major built-in store functions. These
navigational helpers exist before you create the first product or section
page and include my favorites like Home, Info, Show-Order, and Up/Next,
and all the ones I don’t use, like Privacypolicy, Register, Help, E-mail,
Search, Mall, Catalog Request, and more.
 Top-level navigation buttons are created automatically. When you
create a new section page on the home page, Store Editor automatically
creates a button to that section on the navigation button bar on every
page in the Store Editor.
 Links, thumbnails, and Order buttons are also created automatically
when new pages are created. When you create a product, an Order
button appears. A small thumbnail image and text link to that product
Figure 7-2:

pages can

and items,

100
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

automatically appear on its section page. If you feature that item on your
home page as a special, a thumbnail appears on the home page with the
price and a link to that product.
 New pages are automatically searchable. When you create a page, the
Name, Code, and Caption fields of that page are automatically added to
your store’s internal site-search database. Even if you bury a page deep
down in your store, search makes it easy to find!
 Checkout navigation is already set up for you. See Chapter 14 for more
on how the new 2005 v3 Cart allows unbelievable control over cart and
checkout navigation.
 Add more navigational text links. Store Editor stores can have HTML
text links to sections, products, and utility pages across the entire site 
in the Final-text footer of each page. You can also add simple text links
inside Caption fields cross-referencing different products and sections.
 Maximize navigation by adding custom RTML. RTML, Store Editor’s
proprietary template language, makes it possible to add navigational
functionality to Store Editor–built stores, giving you advanced features
like breadcrumbs, Previous/Up/Next buttons, and more, which I intro-
duce in Chapter 26.
Navigation button bars
The Store Editor has built-in navigational button bars, which format the site
and link to your top-level categories, as well as your home page, Info page,
and Shopping Cart/Checkout. You have two options of page-format: Side-
buttons, with buttons running down the left side of the page, or Top-buttons,
with buttons appearing above the product or section page content.
You can find all these controls on the Store Editor’s Variables page, and I talk
a lot more about navigation buttons in Chapter 10.
Make clickable buttons look clickable. You can make your store’s navigation
buttons look raised by making the variable Button-style either Solid or Incised.
Product/section navigation
Imagine your store’s navigation like blocks on a pyramid. The home page is
the top block and the uppermost level. All the top-level navigation pages
(sections within the home page) are on the second level of the pyramid. All
the subsection pages and product pages within those sections are on the
third level. Products within those pages are on the fourth level, and so on.
Figure 7-2 shows you an example of how every Store Editor page can show
you navigation to at least three levels: links up to the home page, links down
to the sections and products within the page you’re on, and (if you turn
Contents on under Contents-elements) links deeper in the site to the pages
within those pages.
101
Chapter 7: Exploring Store Navigation

You control which elements appear on section pages with the variable
Contents-elements, which lets you show an image, the page’s name, or both. I
also recommend displaying the Contents as links. Contents are the pages inside
of a page, and when you display Contents on a section page, the products (or
contents) of each subsection page appear as text links.. Shoppers can easily
click a product link to totally bypass the subsection page and jump straight to
the product page.
Because the average shopper views only five pages, the faster you get him to
a product page, the greater the chance you have to sell him something.
When you’re on a section page, you see thumbnails and links to all the pages
(products and subsections) inside that section page. Thumbnails are auto-
matically generated from the Image file for each product or section page. If
you want, you can upload a separate image for the thumbnail by uploading
an image to the Icon property. The size of the thumbnail image, shown in
pixels, is determined by the variables Thumb-height and Thumb-width.
I like to make my thumbnails as small as I can, anywhere from 45 x 45 pixels
to 65 x 65 pixels. The template automatically creates links to all the sections
and products inside a page. The name of each page is used as the anchor text
or link text (the text inside the link).
Here are some other navigation tips for product and section pages:
 Maximize section pages by listing the contents of subsections on the
section pages.
 Show as many thumbnails as you can above the fold.
 Write short section descriptions within the Abstract field. Tell a little
more about what’s inside a section page. Feature more popular products
and use links within those abstracts.
 Focus attention on your bestselling or most profitable products. My
experience has been that a large percentage of your sales comes from a
small handful of your products, so use links, navigation buttons, and
home-page specials to lead your customers to these popular items.
 Make browsing easier with Up and Next buttons to help your customers
view more product pages. When you bump up your page views, your
sales usually follow because your customers spend their time shopping
instead of figuring out how to navigate your site.
 Cross-link related merchandise inside caption fields. Feature related
products and accessories on individual product pages.
 Consolidate similar subsections into fewer sections. If you have only
one or two of an item, you really don’t need a separate section for it.
102
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

 Make links inside the cart and checkout pages open new windows.
Use the target attribute target=_blank or new inside your anchor
tags to keep folks on task to complete their order. I talk a lot more about
the new checkout in Chapter 14 and discuss usability and conversion
rate improvements in Chapter 21.
Linking to optimize navigation
Text links are extremely important navigational tools for users and search
engines. Your site automatically creates text links to all the sections and
products within a given page, but I like to add a text-link site map with any-
where from 20 to 30 text links at the bottom of every page. Figure 7-3 shows
text links in the footer of a page featuring popular keywords linking to my
most popular pages.
Here are some guidelines for navigational links:
 Underline your links to make the text look like links. The Store Editor
underlines your links automatically, but some folks override this setting
with CSS because they think it looks better when folks have to mouse
over a link for it to show the underline. Please don’t do this!
 If words are not links, then don’t underline them. Why they ever
invented the underline tag, <U>. . .</U>, is anybody’s guess!
 Link to your most valuable pages with your most valuable keywords.
 Use relevant keywords in anchor text (the underlined words inside a
link). Keyword-rich link text is good for users (so they’ll know what the
linked page is really about) and for search engines (so they’ll know what
the linked page is really about, too!). For example, if this paragraph was
text on a Web page, it would be better to say “Read about using relevant
keywords in anchor text.” than to say “Click here to read about using rel-
evant keywords in anchor text.”
Figure 7-3:
Text links in

Editor page.
103
Chapter 7: Exploring Store Navigation

Links and the text within those links are extremely important to search
engines. Search engines use a process called reputation analysis, which reads
the anchor text to know what the pages linked to are about. For example, if
you link to a page with the anchor text “cheap iPod accessories,” then search
engines figure out that that page is probably about cheap iPod accessories,
especially if those exact words are also on the page. I talk a lot more about
this in my search engine optimization chapter, Chapter 19.
Here is a simple text link:
<a href=cheap-ipod-accessories.html>Cheap iPod Accessories</a>
This simple HTML code creates a link to the cheap-ipod-accessories.
html page on whatever domain you’re already on. I put this code in the Final-
text field under Variables.
Links with just href=pagename.html are called relative URLs because they
don’t move you to another domain, but assume that you just want to move 
to another page in the folder on the same domain where you already are.
Because all Store Editor–created pages are in the same folder, relative URLs
work both in the published store and within the Store Editor.
Make a list of 10 to 20 of your best pages and link to them with the most rele-
vant keywords in the anchor text.
Here are links to three sections, centered, with keywords in the anchor text,
which are separated by the pipe character:
<div align=center>
<a href=section1.html>Section1 Keyword Phrase</a> |
<a href=section2.html>Section2 Keyword Phrase</a> |
<a href=section3.html>Section3 Keyword Phrase</a> 
</div>
Figure 7-4 shows an example of a page that links to other pages within the
Caption field. Here’s an example of good internal linking inside a Caption
field. Notice the model number is inside the anchor text:
All of these WidgeCo-2000 Widgets work great indoors,
but if you’re looking for a portable widget, try the
battery-powered <a href=widget430.html>Widget 430</a>
104
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

Shopping by Searching Your Store
Every Yahoo! Store has an internal search engine that lets a user search
pages from your online store and delivers high-quality search results. Your
store’s search page is located at www.yourdomain.com/nsearch.html or
http://store.yourdomain.com/nsearch.html, depending on how you
set up your domain.
When you search for a keyword, your internal store search looks for that
word or phrase in the Name, Code, and Caption fields.
Figure 7-5 shows an example of a store’s internal search-engine results page
with the first ten most-relevant pages. Search results are ranked in order from
most to least relevant. Orderable items with prices show a small thumbnail
image, the name of the page (which is also a link to that page), a small snip-
pet of text, and the selling price from either the Price field or the Sale-price
field (if it has one). Sections or other nonorderable pages show up with the
page name as a link and display a snippet of text with the keyword.
Here are some things you need to know about your site search:
 Modifying the look of your search page is easy. The way your search
page looks is determined by settings in the global Variables when you
use standard templates.
 Use the Code field for quick internal searches. When someone performs
a store search, Yahoo! looks for that keyword phrase in the Name, Caption,
and Code fields. Each item has a Code as a unique product identifier. For
example, if you have a customer on the phone and want to show her a spe-
cific product — say, the Flextone Canada Goose Call page — instead of
telling her the full URL, tell her to do a store search for that product’s
Code. Say “Do a store search for 1238.”
Figure 7-4:
Text links in

your store.
105
Chapter 7: Exploring Store Navigation

 Name products what customers call things. Add keywords to your
Caption fields. Help pages rank better in your internal search engine by
naming your products in English, not just using the brand or trade
names.
For example, my distributor says a product is called “SCOTT JRT JR
TISSUE, WHITE,” but customers search for “Scott toilet paper.” If the
phrase “toilet paper” is not in the Name or Caption field, the page a cus-
tomer is really searching for may be buried under less-relevant results,
like under the Scott paper towels and Scott napkins pages.
 Account for typos and misspellings. If the same customer couldn’t spell
(or just made a typo) and searched for “scot toliet paper,” the only word
store search finds is paper, so paper cups, paper vacuum bags, and paper
baking cups show up before any Scott toilet paper. To account for mis-
spellings and alternate names of products, you can add text to the
bottom of the caption field of the relevant section page. “Sometimes
referred to as misspelling, other misspelling, or yet another misspelling,
and so on.” If you don’t want to clutter your section pages, create spe-
cial pages with keyword-loaded captions designed to get caught up in
your internal store search results and then link to the relevant product
or section pages from those misspellings pages.

106
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

 Put a message with text or links on the search results page. Add text or
links to appear right above your search results pages by adding the text
to the Caption field of your ID:nsearch page. Add links to your best-
selling products, buyers’ guides, and your FAQ or list your 800 number
to help people who can’t find what they’re looking for by searching.
 Put search all over your site. Yahoo! gives you the option of adding a
Search button to your navigation buttons. This button simply links to
your nsearch.html page. It’s really better to have a search box on
every page. When I use standard templates, I add a bit of HTML code
inside the Final-Text field under Variables for an easy search box.
Replace accountname with your store’s account name/number. Older
stores have alphanumeric store account names, such as webstore-
design or gundog-intl. Newer stores (September 2003 and later) have
accounts like yhst-17192271484370. Here’s the code:
<form name=vw-form method=post
action=”http://search.store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/nsearch”>
<input type=hidden name=vwcatalog value=accountname>
<input name=query type=text size=30>
<input type=submit value=Search></form>
 Try some cool linking tricks. Linking to store search results pages
allows you to do some really, really cool things, like create extremely rel-
evant landing pages. What’s a more relevant page for a searcher than a
store search page showing the ten most relevant items and sections?
For example, we sell only a few types of Flextone duck calls. If I wanted to
show a shopper all the Flextone duck calls, I could link to my Flextone
duck calls section page, which may or may not have all the calls we sell
depending on how vigilant I am at merchandising. A link to an internal
store search for flextone+duck+calls would search all items and sections.
Link to store search results pages with URLs like this:
search.store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/nsearch?catalog=accountname&query=
keyword+phrase
Replace accountname with your store’s account name/number. Replace
keyword+phrase with your real search phrase. You can separate words
with a + sign or with %20, which is just a fancy way to encode a space
character.
 See the search phrases used on your store. Yahoo! shows you exactly
what words folks use to search your store. You can see these keywords
under the Store Manager’s Store Searches. This information is extremely
valuable to see what keyword phrases are most popular, as well as what
products folks can’t find easily with your internal navigation.
107
Chapter 7: Exploring Store Navigation

 Hide pages with Nosearch tags. Sometimes you don’t want a particular
page to show up in your internal store search results. All you have do is
add a Nosearch tag to the Caption field, and the internal search engine
ignores that page. I use the Nosearch tag to hide coupons, testimonials,
and newsletter pages and to move pesky pages that seem to rank well
for popular keywords for my own internal store search. Here’s the tag
that you paste inside the Name or Caption field:
<!--NOSEARCH-->
The NOSEARCH tag also excludes the product from being included in
Yahoo! Shopping, so be mindful of that as you use it. See Chapter 17 for
more on Yahoo! Shopping.
 Make all pages searchable. The prebuilt function pages, such as home
page, privacypolicy, and the info page, have valuable information inside
nonsearchable Intro-text, Message, and other text fields. If you use the
standard templates (page.) in the Store Editor, a simple workaround
makes this information searchable. All you do is create a New-Property
Big-text field named Caption and copy the text from the unsearchable
fields into the Caption field. The information doesn’t actually display on
the store, but it will be searchable.
To see this search hack in action, visit www.ystorebooks.com and
search for secret home page search test. You can see the text in the
results, but it exists nowhere on the visible home page. Pretty cool! You
can use this trick for misspellings, too.

Selling with Pictures
In This Chapter
 Picturing possibilities with images
 Compressing photos and other files
 Uploading images to the Store Editor
 Collecting graphics and converting images to Web-friendly formats
 Selling with super product photography
P
icture this: Good photography sells your products by showing all the
details. Imagine what someone needs to see before he buys. The more
expensive an item, the more pictures you need to sell it. Professional pictures
produce profits.
Manufacturers’ product photos usually work okay, but often their photos are
barely adequate. Fortunately, Photoshop fixes most faux pas. Great product
photography takes your store to a whole ’nother level. A picture of a person
actually using the product you want to sell thrusts the customer into an imag-
inary world, where she can visualize the benefits of buying.
Stand apart from all the other cookie-cutter retailers with your own unique
and professional graphics. Custom graphics like logos, icons, navigational
elements, and buttons turn your Web site into a store that sells stuff.
Yahoo! Store makes managing Web images easy because the Editor automati-
cally creates thumbnails images for you and displays product images at a
consistent size across the site. You don’t have to be a graphic designer. You
just upload your images and away you go. In this chapter, I show you how to
upload photos to the Store Editor and balance good-looking graphics with
super-fast downloads for dialups. I also point out the different types of
images in a Yahoo! Store, show you how to compress files, and optimize your
pages for speedy downloads!

Looking to Images to Sell More Stuff
Images are a lot like donuts. The more you have, the heavier you are, and the
slower you move! I’ll admit it, I can’t seem to eat just one! (Ummm, Shipley’s!)
I tend to gorge on images, too. I’ll upload a big, beautiful 75KB product photo,
and then hope I can crunch the heck out of everything else to get a fast-
loading product page.
In the good ol’ days, some designers just made a picture of a Web site in
Photoshop, chopped it into four or five pieces, and uploaded the graphics.
The image-only Web-design method gives you a beautiful-looking Web store
with absolute control over the appearance. There are only two downsides:
You don’t get any free search-engine traffic because the search engines have
no idea what your site is about, and the half of the country on dialup or
“slow” broadband will never be able to shop your site because it will take too
long to load. Hopefully, you don’t care about free traffic or losing half of your
potential customers. (I’m teasing!)
110
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 
Addicted to images
Some retailers are more interested in having a
beautiful Yahoo! Store than having a profitable
Yahoo! Store. I think you can have both, but if I
really had to choose, I’d rather have a prof-
itable, ugly store than a beautiful, unprofitable
one.
A few years ago, I was doing some online mar-
keting consulting for a retailer who owned one
of the most beautiful Yahoo! Stores I have ever
seen. His designer (who I won’t name) was a
master of Photoshop and had skillfully designed
a beautiful storefront with huge sweeping
splashes of color, mixed with brilliant photogra-
phy, and custom section navigation buttons with
literally every color of the rainbow. It was the
crown jewel of this designer’s portfolio, which
admittedly kicks my butt up and down the street
in the “make it pretty” department.
The reason this fellow called me was because he
was working 60 to 80 hours a week between fill-
ing orders for his Yahoo! Store and still working
full-time at his “real” job because his online store
was grossing maybe $10,000 a month in revenue.
Ouch! Store sales were so low because it loaded
so slowly. I think the average page size was
around 200K, which is about four or five times as
big as it should be. Holy cow!
A few days later, another client called. This
retailer had just passed the million-dollars-a-year
mark in sales, and he wanted to keep on trucking.
While we were talking on the phone, my million-
dollar-a-year client e-mailed me a link to my new
marketing client’s store. “That’s the one! I want
my store to be just like that one!” What a freaky
coincidence!
I told him, “My friend, trust me, but you don’t
want a store like that one. I can’t tell you why I
know or what I know, but I’d bet dollars to donuts
that guy would trade stores (and sales) with you
in a heartbeat.” Remember: You want a store that
looks good and sells good!

Look: There is a very precarious balancing act between having nice images
with plenty of detail and having Web pages load too slowly because of either
large image files and/or too many image files. (For more on this topic, see the
sidebar “Addicted to images.” ) Usability guru Jakob Nielsen says that you
have about 10 seconds for a page to load before the average visitor gets
impatient and clicks the Back button. Nowadays with broadband, folks are
even more impatient than ever. I talk a lot more about usability and improv-
ing conversion rate and stalking Jakob Nielsen in Chapter 21.
There is a direct relationship between fast-loading Web pages and higher con-
version rates. Remember that about half of Internet users in America are still
on dialup. The faster your page loads, the more pages the average visitor will
look at. The more pages they look at, the more they buy.
Deciphering Image Formats
I could talk for days about the gory details of image and file formats for Web
graphics, but as a retailer, you need to know only a few things: There are two
image file formats that matter, JPEG and GIF:
 JPEGs are for photographs. Shown in Figure 8-1, the JPEG file format
gives you the option to compress your images by removing details that
may not be visible in a Web browser. I compress my JPEGs about 15 per-
cent in Paint Shop Pro. Be careful. When you overcompress your JPEGs,
your image looks like a photograph that has gotten too close to a flame,
and all the little bubbles pop up.
 GIFS are for graphics with flat areas of color, such as logos (see Figure
8-2). This file format gives you up to 256 different colors. GIFs are bitmap
files. Zoom in on a GIF file, and you see a map of bits of color, which
looks like a sheet of graph paper that’s been colored in. Be careful here,
too. Overcompress your GIF files, and they look crunchy and pixilated
like a fifth- or sixth-generation photocopy.
Web graphics are low-resolution graphics usually designed at 72 dpi (dots per
inch). Lower-resolution images have smaller file sizes, which translates into
faster download speeds. When you print a GIF or JPEG file, it may look
choppy, distorted, or pixilated because most black-and-white or color print-
ers have a print resolution of anywhere from 300 dpi to 1200 dpi.
111
Chapter 8: Selling with Pictures

Image files have two different sizes:
 Display size: This is the height and width of an image measured in
pixels.
 File size (or weight): This is how much space the image takes up on
your hard drive, measured in bytes, kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or
even gigabytes (GB), depending on how large the file is.

Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

File size is still important. Even though most people have broadband at work,
and about half of the United States is on broadband at home, you need to
compress your images and aim for a total file size (images and other files) of
no more than 50K for a fast-loading Yahoo! Store.
Just for reference, a 3.5-inch high-density (HD) floppy disk could store
1.44MB or about 25 fast-loading Web pages including images. In contrast, a
CD-ROM can hold 650MB of data, which is about 13,000 fast-loading Web
pages including images.
Working with Product Images 
in the Store Editor
If you’ve used any other Web-hosting setup, you’ll soon notice that Yahoo!
Store Editor handles files a little differently. Product images are resized to fit
product pages. Thumbnail images (smaller versions of the product images)
are automatically created for these products to show on section pages. You
can also override thumbnails and upload your own custom image to the Icon
property of an item or section page to have a thumbnail that’s not just a
small version of the product page’s image.
One cool Yahoo! Store feature is that the Editor automatically resizes your
product images to display consistently across your store, almost no matter
how big an image you upload, as shown in Figure 8-3. You can upload images
up to 2MB file size (but don’t — 100K max!) and still have consistent-looking
product images.
Here are a few things you need to know about images uploaded to the Editor:
 If your uploaded image is the same size or smaller than your Item-
height/Item-width variables, the product page displays the image at the
original size.
 If your uploaded image is larger than the Item-height/Item-width, the
Store Editor redraws that image as a GIF file. Clicking the image takes
you to the full-size image.
 If your uploaded image is way too big or is an illegal file format, you see
what I call the “Red Square of Death” instead of the image. Upload a
Photoshop file to the Image property on an item to see what I mean. To
fix this square, simply upload a GIF or JPEG, and if the file is too big,
simply resize your file and upload it again.
113
Chapter 8: Selling with Pictures

For example, upload an 800-x-800-pixel JPEG as a product image. If your Item-
height and Item-width settings are 300 x 300, the Yahoo! store is automatically
going to redraw your big honking JPEG file the size that it’s supposed to be.
Sweet! (See the sidebar “My preferences for Store Editor image sizes,” later in
this chapter, for more on sizing your images.)
When you upload an image file larger than Item-height and Item-width, the
resized product image becomes a clickable link to a page showing the full-
size version of the image you uploaded. Uploading large product images may
be very appropriate for certain types of products (jewelry, electronics, or fur-
niture) that have details you may miss in smaller product images. For exam-
ple, you can show a smaller product image on the item page at 300 x 300
pixels, and when a user clicks the picture, the original image is displayed 
full-sized.
Don’t rely on Yahoo! to resize your product images. Compress your JPEGs
and size them down to your preferred display size (I like 300 x 300 pixels) to
maximize load speed.

114
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

When an uploaded JPEG file is taller or wider than the Item-height or Item-
width settings under Variables, the Store Editor redraws the file as a shorter
and/or narrower GIF file but with a much larger file size than a JPEG of the
same image. Bigger file size = slower download speed = less page views =
fewer shoppers converted into buyers = less money in your pocket. Consider
resizing all your product images to fit within whatever your Item-height or
Item-width Variables settings are.
Uploading Images to the Store Editor
You can upload images to the Store Editor in several ways, but most folks
upload images by hand, one page at a time. Here’s how to upload images:
 You can browse to the page you want and click the Image button in the
Edit Nav-bar and upload the GIF or JPEG from your hard drive to the Y!
Image Server.
 You can browse to a page, click the Edit button on the Edit Nav-bar to go
to the Edit page, and then click the Upload button to the right of the
Image property.
115
Chapter 8: Selling with Pictures
My preferences for Store Editor images sizes
Because most folks surf the Web with monitors
set to 800 x 600 or 1,024 x 768 screen resolutions,
any images with a display size larger then these
settings would be too big. I prefer my product
photos to display at about 300 x 300 pixels. If I
upload big, big images, I want them no larger
than 800 x 600.
I like my thumbnails to be anywhere from 45 x
45 to 95 x 95 pixels, depending on how many
items I have on a section page. Autogenerated
thumbnails at this size tend to be anywhere from
4K to 8K. You can double your page’s load speed
by optimizing these images (in your graphics
program) down to about 2K and uploading them
to the Icon field.
If you want to see how big an image appears 
on the Web, simply right-click it and choose
Properties from the shortcut menu that appears;
this shows the location, width, height, and size
of the image file (see figure).

 More advanced users can use the Bulk Image Upload feature under
Controls. Create a zip file (a compressed archive created with WinZip
software, available at www.winzip.com) where you name each image
file with its ID so that the Store Editor “knows” which picture goes with
which product. For example, if a product’s ID was 12345, then the name
of the graphics file would be 12345.gif or 12345.jpg. Zip all your
image files into a single zip file and visit the Controls page in the Store
Editor to upload the file, which magically hooks up all the images with
the right products. For more information on this topic, see this book’s
companion Web site at www.ystorebooks.com/bulkimageuploads.
html.
Nothing sells like more details, and nothing shows details like more product
photos. If you want to upload a second picture, such as an alternate product
shot, use the Inset field, as shown in Figure 8-4. For more than two product
shots on an item page, upload the image to your Web-hosting account and
use an HTML image source tag in your Caption field to show the image like
this:
<img src=http://site.yourdomain.com/images/filename.gif>

116
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

It’s impossible to keep people from downloading your images because they
must download an image to even view it in their browser. You can take all
kinds of steps to make it more difficult for unscrupulous people to steal your
images, but it’s almost impossible to stop someone, especially if he knows
anything about computers. Personally, I’m more concerned about direct com-
petition stealing my images than with someone in an unrelated field on a Web
page I’ll probably never see. Put your domain name on your best images!
Finding Product Images
Most of the time, the image files I use to create my Yahoo! Store product images
come from manufacturers’ Web sites. Make sure that you have permission
before you do use someone else’s images. If you’re selling a company’s prod-
ucts, it will most likely let you use its product photography on your Yahoo!
Store. Images are often already formatted for the Web (JPEGs and GIF files) but
usually need to be compressed or optimized. I also like to brand these images
with my logo or domain names as a watermark (a subtle translucent mark, such
as logo or text, used to brand images) to keep competitors from just copying
my images and uploading them to their Web sites and benefiting from all my
hard work.
Watermark your photos with your company name, domain name, and/or
copyright information.
Fortunately, watermarking is relatively easy. Depending on the graphic soft-
ware you use, make a new layer for the text, but reduce the opacity to about
15 or 20 percent so that the text is translucent.
Always get permission before using anyone else’s images. Not only is it very
bad manners to steal images from other Web sites, it’s also probably a viola-
tion of copyright law.
The worst thing you can do is steal images from competitors who can use
this mistake to get you kicked out of your Yahoo! Store, get your site removed
from the search engines, and sue you for up to $100,000 per copyright viola-
tion. I’m not a lawyer, but you need to keep your nose clean. I have one com-
petitor stealing lots of my images, and my lawyer wants this image-thief to
pay for his summer home in Mantachie.
You can also find images through other means:
 Request manufacturers’ CD-ROMs. Manufacturers who supply catalog
retailers with product images can provide you with high-resolution 
TIFF files even if they don’t have Web images for you. These super-huge
image files (around 2,000KB) need to be resized and compressed in 
your graphics software to a more Web-friendly 72 dpi (around 40KB 
or smaller).
117
Chapter 8: Selling with Pictures

 Scan catalogs, brochures, and sale sheets provided by distributors and
wholesalers. Turning these images into Web-ready product photos takes
a little more work. You have to scan them with a flatbed scanner at about
300 dpi, remove any hickeys, dirt, or telltale signs of the printing process,
and then shrink them to about 72 dpi. If you sell flat items smaller than
81⁄2 x 11 inches (such as books or DVDs), flatbed scanners are better and
quicker than digital cameras for creating quality product images.
 Take your own product photos. With the magic of today’s digital cam-
eras and the editing power of graphics programs, you don’t have to be a
professional photographer to get professional-looking results. Sometimes
you have to fiddle with your setup a bit to get it right, but after you get
going, you can knock out a ton of photos in a hurry. If you get half-decent
photos, you can clean them up in your graphics program lickety-split!
(For more on graphics programs, see the next section in this chapter.)
Tweaking Your Images
When you’re working with images, you need several things: a better-than-
average computer with a decent monitor, a large hard drive, and graphics soft-
ware for creating and modifying images. You can also use a flatbed scanner, a
mid-line digital camera and other camera equipment, a CD burner, and some
other form of external storage, such as a removable hard drive or tape backup.
You also need special software to create or edit Web graphics. As shown in
Figure 8-5, I use Paint Shop Pro. I’ve been using the same software ever since
1997, when I got a demo version. You can get your copy for around $129 (or
maybe less). I also think Adobe Photoshop is cool, but it has way too many
features that most folks never use and costs a lot (around $695). Photoshop
is the industry standard for designers with tons and tons of tutorials and
other resources on the Web. I’m old and cheap, and pretty much stuck in my
ways by now. Both Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro have batch-processing fea-
tures for automating repetitive tasks for editing images, which can save a lot
of time if you work with lots of product images.
No matter which graphics software you choose, it needs to enable you to do
certain basic things to your images:
 Take screen shots: Most graphics programs have a screen shot function.
Turn it on, click a button, and then whatever image was on your screen is
now captured and saved inside your graphics software, where you can
manipulate it. Use screen shots as the foundation for a complete redesign
or to quickly capture logos or other design elements from your site.
Yahoo! Store’s very own Senior Technical Content Producer Paul
Boisvert says, “There is a neat extension for Firefox out now called
Screengrab (http://andy.5263.org/screengrab). It allows you to
right-click to get the area inside the browser, and more importantly, it
118
Part II: Planning What’s in Store 

can scroll to get a full browser window. This feature will probably be
standard in Firefox within a few versions, but this may be a good little
tool for Firefox users.”
 Crop the excess space around an image: Remove excess negative space
(the white space around an image) to make images load faster and
improve the look of product photos and autogenerated thumbnails.
 Add a 1-pixel border to the outside of an image: I prefer my product
photos to have white backgrounds so that the objects appear to float 
on the page. Sometimes a light gray border really defines the image, but
sometimes a dark border is just too much. Whether you should add 
borders to product images totally depends on your site design.
When you add borders to one product image, you really need to 
add a border to every product image, or your site looks inconsistent.
Autogenerated thumbnails with 1-pixel borders tend to look a little
sloppy, so you need to make custom icons for each one. I really like the
look of a 1-pixel border around the edges of a 95-x-95-pixel thumbnail.
 Adjust image parameters such as contrast, brightness, color balance,
and so on: You can radically improve the quality of a photo by making
subtle changes to various settings in your graphics software, but be
careful not to overtweak your images or fall into your work and lose all
track of time.

119
Chapter 8: Selling with Pictures

 Export an image as a GIF or JPEG file: There is always a trade-off
between the quality of an image and how big the file size is. When you
convert an image to either GIF or JPEG formats, the resulting image file
size is much smaller, but this compression degrades the image quality.
For this reason, I usually work with a copy of an image file rather than
the original file so that when I need to start over, I can just go back to my
original file. (For more on these formats, see the section “Deciphering
Image Formats,” earlier in this chapter.)
Working with Text Inside Graphics
Different graphics programs have different ways of adding text to images, but
there are several universal truths:
 It’s better to work with a high-resolution image in your graphics soft-
ware and then export the image as a lower-resolution file. If your origi-
nal image file is a GIF file with 256 colors (8-bit), increase the file
bit-depth from 8-bit to 24-bit, which gives you up to 16 million colors,
create your file, and then save it and compress it as a GIF.
 Create your text graphics at their real size so that you can see how
fonts display. Sometimes when you resize images with text, the text
becomes illegible.
 Anti-alias your text. Sometimes you’ll see graphics or text on sites
where folks didn’t anti-alias the text, which is a feature on most graphics
programs that smoothes the edges of fonts by blending the font color
into the background color. If you don’t anti-alias fonts in images, words
look choppy or have the jaggies, as shown in Figure 8-6.

Part III
Building and
Managing
Your Store

In this part . . .
T
his part contains everything I wanted to know back in
1997 when I started building stores. I’ll be candid here.
I love building stores with the Store Editor. The Editor is
an extremely powerful and easy-to-use store-building tool,
but I would hardly call some of the intermediate or
advanced functions intuitive.
Hey! I’ve been working with the Store Editor since way
back when, but sometimes I still need help figuring out
where some feature is located. For example, I’m always
looking for the switch that moves the Edit Nav-bar to the
top or bottom of the page (Config) or the one where you
make folks who are using the Editor sign in using their
Security Key (Controls).
In this part, I dig into all the details of store building using
the Store Editor and Store Manager. You can find out about
designing your store’s navigation buttons and creating
product pages, section and subsection pages, info pages,
and even the most important page on your site, your home
page. I share all the good tips and tricks I’ve picked up in
the past eight or nine years of store building.
After you build your store, I show you how to sell more
products using Store Editor features, such as home page
Specials and Shopping Cart Cross-sells. You also find out
about the new Checkout Manager and Shopping Cart,
which give you a previously unknown level of control over
checkout design. Finally, I wrap up this part of the book
with pretty much everything you need to know about
mastering the Store Manager, which is a pretty big chapter
with a lot of information on setting up your store with
shipping methods and rates, setting tax rates, and most
importantly, processing orders!

T
he Store Editor is a powerful online tool for building your Yahoo! Store
and managing the products you sell. You can control the look and feel of
your store from settings on the global Variables page. In addition, you can
create, edit, and delete products in a hidden copy of your store so that you
see exactly what customers will see.
The Store Editor is easy to use, too. New retailers and Webmasters can make
good-looking stores in no time at all without additional software or program-
ming skills. Power users can tweak templates to create customized stores
designed to convert shoppers into buyers.
In this chapter, I introduce the Store Editor, explore Editor geography, discuss
basic store-building concepts, show you how to tweak your settings for maxi-
mum power editing and how to navigate the Store Editor, get you started creat-
ing new products and sections, and give you an overview of the store Variables
page. The Store Editor makes it easy to make more with a Yahoo! Store.
Getting Started in Store Editor
The Store Editor is the tool you use to build your online store and manage
your products. Most successful store owners use the Editor almost every
single business day. The Store Editor is also the tool you use to manage your
virtual store and merchandise.

Settings on the global Variables page determine how the basic store templates
display product information, including store layout, colors, fonts, text size,
and more. Power users have even more control by modifying copies of exist-
ing templates or building new templates from scratch. I introduce RTML tem-
plates in Chapter 26.
Because the Editor is a copy of your store, you can see your site the same
way your customers do as you manage your product pages. The Store Editor
is really just a copy of your Yahoo! Store with the Edit Nav-bar stuck on top of
it. Every product page, section page, and function page in your store has its
counterpart inside the Store Editor.
The Store Editor comes with additional controls, such as the global Variables
page where you edit settings to control the look and feel of the site. It also
has tools for advanced users, such as Database Uploads for quick and easy
product uploads; Types and Templates to help customize your products; and
other advanced Editor settings, which I cover later in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Meeting the Edit Nav-bar buttons.”
Editing your store
Your store has two versions: the public (or published) version of your store
and the hidden Store Editor version of your site:
 You can see the published version of your store at http://store.
yahoo.com/yhst-youraccountnumber or at your domain name. I
delve into the details of domains in Chapter 24.
 The Store Editor is where you make changes to your store’s design and
product info and is accessible to only Yahoo! IDs listed in the Store
Manager’s Access panel. You control who gets in the back room.
Edits you make in Store Editor are invisible to store visitors until you click
the Publish button. Thanks to the Store Editor, you can make major changes
to the navigation, design, layout, products, and pricing on your Yahoo! Store
without everyone in the world seeing what you’re doing. You can make
wholesale changes to the design of your Web site and publish the changes
only when you’re ready for the site to launch.
To get started editing your store, follow these steps:
1. Go to http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/services and log in
with your Yahoo! ID and your password.
The Manage My Services page appears.
124
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

2. Click your store account link.
The Store Manager page appears.
3. Click the Store Editor link.
A copy of your store’s home page appears, and you’re now inside the
Store Editor, where you can make edits.
Notice the Edit Nav-bar floating above (or below) your store page. You know
you’re in the Editor when the URL in your browser starts with http://edit.
store.yahoo.com/RT/NEWEDIT/youraccountname, or you see the Edit
Nav-bar. Notice the Publish button in the upper right corner.
Multiple people can work inside the Store Editor at the same time, as long as
they’re not working on the same pages. When someone does try to edit a
page that another person is already editing, a warning message pops up to
the second person: “Locked. Sorry, this resource ‘{ID of page}’ is currently
locked by another user. Either click on Clear Lock to remove the lock, or click
on Cancel to try again later.” Don’t select Clear Lock unless you want to
screw up what the other person’s doing.
Publishing your edits to the Store
The Publish button has two states: Publish and Published. When the button
is cream-colored and says Publish, changes have been made inside the Store
Editor, but the published version of the site has not yet been updated.
When you’re ready to publish your changes to the Store Editor, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Variables button and then click the Update button right
before you publish to force the Store Editor to generate and publish
every single page.
The Store Editor is pretty smart and knows which pages you edited
since you last published. To save time and resources, the new Store
Editor generates and publishes only the pages it knows you edited.
When products appear on multiple pages, sometimes the information on
section pages or custom templates doesn’t get updated, so always
update your Variables before publishing.
2. Click the Publish button.
The Publish Status page, shown in Figure 9-1, appears to monitor the
published progress and refreshes every five seconds. The Store Editor
generates the HTML pages reflecting your changes and then uploads
125
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

those HTML pages to the Yahoo! servers. (This process takes anywhere
from 30 seconds to 15 minutes.)
If you don’t care to watch your progress, click the Store Manager link to
exit. I usually go check my stats or something while impatiently waiting
for the store to publish. You can tell when the Editor is finished publish-
ing because a link back to the Store Editor appears.
After you publish changes, the Publish button turns gray and says Published.
However, the moment you edit anything at all, for example, you access the
Variables page or click Edit and change a single property on a product, the
Published button changes back to a cream-colored button.
No one can see the changes you’ve made in the Store Editor until you click
the Publish button.
By default, the Publish button appears only on the home page (next to the
Manager button), but you can add these site buttons to every page by click-
ing the Controls button and changing the Site Buttons setting to Every Page,
which puts a Publish and Manager button on every page. I get more into the
Controls in just a little bit in the “Setting the Controls for the Editor” section.
Here are some things you need to know about publishing your store:
 When the Store Editor is publishing, you can’t work inside the Store
Editor. If another person’s editing the store when someone clicks the
Publish button, the other person’s version of the Editor freezes. If he
happens to be editing a particular page, those edits are lost.
 Don’t click any Store Editor links while the store is publishing. Also,
don’t try to log back in to the Store Editor from inside the Store Manager.
Five or more clicks on any Store Editor link locks up the Store Editor for
a lot longer than it takes for the store to publish. Be patient!
 Publishing the Store Editor publishes both the Store Editor and the
Catalog Manager (if you even use it). Publishing doesn’t publish the Order

publishing
process.
126
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Settings, such as changes made in the Store Manager to Shipping, Taxes, or
other back-end settings. I talk about the Store Manager in Chapter 15.
 Sometimes it takes a while for the Store Editor software to publish
your site. The amount of time usually depends on how many products
you have. Bigger stores take longer to publish. I usually use publishing
as an excuse to step away from my computer and stretch my legs.
 Sometimes old pages get stuck in your browser. For example, if you just
changed the price on a product and have published the store, but the
product page you see is the old page with the old price, the problem may
be that the old page is cached in your browser. Click the Refresh or Reload
button in your browser when you view the published version of your store
to make sure that you’re seeing the most current version of the page.
Customizing Your Editor for Editing
The default settings for the Store Editor are pretty helpful to new retailers,
but you’ll find a bunch of stuff in the way after you know the basics. When I
log in to Store Editor for the first time, I have to make my nest. Here’s what I
recommend, which I describe in the following sections:
 Switch to Advanced mode. (See the section “Switching to Advanced
mode,” later in this chapter.)
 Move the Edit Nav-bar to the top of your Editor pages. (See the section
“Moving the Edit Nav-bar,” later in this chapter.)
 Hide the Help button. (See the section “Meeting the Edit Nav-bar but-
tons,” later in this chapter.)
 Add the Find and Publish/Manager buttons to every page. (See the sec-
tion “Meeting the Edit Nav-bar buttons,” later in this chapter.)
 Tweak a few other settings. (See the section “Meeting the Edit Nav-bar
buttons,” later in this chapter.)
127
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor
Publishing protocols work
Because multiple people are always editing our
stores, before we can publish, someone yells,
“Can I publish the store?” and a chorus of “Fine
by me!” echoes throughout the warehouse
unless someone is in the middle of something,
and then you can hear him holler, “No! No! Don’t
publish! Whatever you do, do not publish!”

Switching to Advanced mode
The Store Editor is in Regular mode by default, and you need to access some
power tools provided by Advanced mode. It’s easy to understand why retail-
ers may be hesitant to jump off into Advanced mode with warnings like the
following:
“The Advanced Editor is designed for experienced programmers — all
protections against damaging your store are turned off. In Advanced mode it
is easy to damage your store or break pages beyond repair. For that reason,
we recommend it only for experienced programmers.”
Okay. No sweat! You bought the right book. Raise your right hand and repeat
after me: “I am an experienced programmer.” Then click the little red arrow to
the right of the Edit Nav-bar to change the Store Editor from Regular mode to
Advanced mode. The Editor shifts into Advanced mode. Notice that a second
row of buttons appears on the Edit Nav-bar with functions that weren’t avail-
able to the basic user in Regular mode.
Moving the Edit Nav-bar
The Edit Nav-bar, shown in Figure 9-2, is the Swiss army knife of the Store
Editor. The Edit Nav-bar helps you navigate the store, lets you Edit pages, or
changes settings in the Variables or Controls pages.
One of the first things I do is move the Edit Nav-bar from the bottom of every
page to the top of the Store Editor so that I don’t have to scroll to the bottom
of the Editor every time I want to make a change. Save your finger and the
scroll wheel on your mouse and do the same:
1. Click the Config button.
The Config page appears.
Figure 9-2:
The Edit
Nav-bar is
the Swiss
army knife
of Nav-bars.
128
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

2. Change the Edit-button-position from Bottom to Top.
3. Click the Update button.
The last page you were on in the Editor appears, but this time your Edit
Nav-bar is at the top of the screen. It’s magic!
Meeting the Edit Nav-bar buttons
The Edit Nav-bar is your friend. Here are some of the Edit Nav-bar buttons
and what they do:
 Edit: Click the Edit button to open the Edit page of whatever page you’re
currently on. Using this button, you can add, edit, or delete text in the
various fields or upload images.
 Edit All: Click this button to edit all the items inside a section at once.
Edit All lets you edit the Name, Code, Options, Price, and Sale-Price
fields. Edit All displays ten items at a time. You can save your work as
you edit each group of ten items.
 Section: Click this button to create a new section page.
 Item: Click this button to create a new item page.
 Link: Click this button to create a Link-object, which is the Store Editor’s
way to create hypertext links to other Web sites without coding HTML.
Who needs HTML anchor tags when all you have to do is know the URL?
Simply name the Link and away you go. Link-objects have Name, URL,
Image (for a thumbnail), Abstract, and Label fields. Most of the time,
Link-objects are used for making objects for a links or a resources page.
Sometimes I use Link-objects instead of a copy of the same ID. 
 Move: Click the Move button for an easier way to reorder navigation but-
tons or products inside your section pages. Click the Move button, click
the item you want to move, and then click where you want it to go.
 Image: Click this button to jump to a shortcut to upload a graphic to the
Image field on a section or item without having to first click the Edit
button. Unfortunately, you cannot delete an Image, only upload a new
one, which overwrites a previously uploaded file.
 Variables: Click this button to open the global Variables page, which
affects the look and feel of almost every page in your store. This page is
where all the action is!
 Manager: Click this button to jump back to the Store Manager. The
Manager button appears only on the home page unless you change the
Site Buttons setting under Controls To Every Page, which puts a Publish
129
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

and Manager button on every page; this change can save you a click or
two. I put Site Buttons on every page on stores I work on by myself, but
not on pages where multiple people work on the site at the same time
because it’s almost too easy for someone else to publish while you’re in
the middle of something!
 Help/Hide Help: Click this button to turn Store Editor Help on and off. If
you don’t need Help all the time, turn it off because the Help labels and
definitions take up a lot of screen real estate.
 Publish: Click this button to publish your store. Publish makes the Store
Editor generate a new copy of your site using the RTML templates you
assign to each page to crank out an HTML page, generates any new
images you need, and updates the published version of your store to
match the changes you’ve made in the Store Editor. The Publish button
appears only on the home page unless you change the Site Buttons set-
ting under Controls to Every Page.
 Find: Click this button to open the Find By ID form, where you type or
paste in the ID of a page you want to jump to. Remember, IDs must be
lowercase, or the Store Editor gets confused. I highly recommend that
you turn on the Find button on the Controls page (set the Show Find
Button setting to Yes).
 Contents: Click this button to open the Contents or site map page, which
displays a hierarchical site map of your Yahoo! Store.
 Templates: Click this button to go to the Templates page, which shows
you a list of the 80 or so built-in RTML templates and any custom tem-
plates you’ve created. From this page, you can look at the built-in tem-
plates (but not edit them), copy existing RTML templates that you can
modify, create new RTML templates, and delete old RTML templates.
RTML is dangerous fun. Check out Chapter 26 for more on RTML.
 {Page2}: When you’re on a page using a custom template, the name of
that custom template appears on the Edit Nav-bar instead of the Templates
button. Click that button to fire up the RTML edit page for that template.
The regular Template button is a click away in the Edit Nav-bar.
Notice the period after the name of each of the types and templates. The
period tells the Store Editor that the type is a prebuilt type and can’t be
edited. Also, when you’re in the RTML Editor, the last button on the
second row of the Edit Nav-bar displays the ID of the last page you were
on, so you can easily make changes to your template and then click that
button to see the changes on a page using that template.
 Types: Click this button to load the Types page. You create custom types
in the Editor to use in conjunction only with custom RTML templates, so
beginners need to steer clear. The Types page is where you can create
custom types (with custom fields), add new fields to existing custom
types, and delete unused custom types. See all the built-in types (such as
130
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

empty., info., item., link., main., norder., privacypolicy., raw-html., and
search.), any custom types you created, and custom tables you created
in the Catalog Manager.
A type in the Store Editor is very similar to a table in Catalog Manager.
Types and tables are lists of fields or properties that an object can have.
For example, the built-in Type (item.) is the default and is used for sec-
tions and products. Every ID that’s an (item.) type has Name, Code, and
Price fields so that you can add this information every time you create a
new page.
 Database Uploads: Click this button to go to the Database Uploads page,
where you can upload CSV files to create and modify sections and items.
I live for database uploads and gush in much detail in Chapter 23.
 Config: Click this button to jump to the page where you edit various
Store Editor settings, such as the position of the Edit Nav-bar (top or
bottom of the store), your leafed product page settings (see Chapter 11),
and more.
 Controls: Click this button to explore the Store Editor Controls page,
where you can upload images in bulk, change your Default Editor Mode,
place Publish and Manager buttons on every page, and more.
 Look: Click this button to make site-wide changes to the design by
choosing one of 14 color schemes. Ignore the Look button, or at least be
cautious when using this tool, because it overrides any changes you’ve
made on the Variables page. You can show/hide this button on the
Controls page.
 Layout: Click this button to change the appearance on individual pages
by modifying the number of columns and alignment. I’d avoid using the
Layout button because of the potential for overriding any existing work.
This button is hidden unless you turn it on from the Controls page.
 Red Arrow (left side): Click this arrow/button to return to the Regular
interface of the Editor. The red arrow on the left side of the Edit Nav-bar
indicates that you’re in Advanced mode. When you click the arrow, you
return to Regular mode, and all the Advanced mode Edit Nav-bar but-
tons disappear and the red arrow appears on the right side.
 Red Arrow (right side): Click this arrow/button to switch to the
Advanced interface of Store Editor. The red arrow on the right side of
the Edit Nav-bar means that you’re still in Regular mode. Go ahead and
click the Controls button and change the Default Editor Mode setting to
Advanced so that you’ll always be in Advanced mode. Then you can
have access to the all the wonderful features of the Store Editor.
 Up: Click this button to go up to the section page (Parent object) of
whatever page you’re currently on. The Up button appears on the Edit
Nav-bar only when you’re on a page with a parent page.
131
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

Navigating the Store Editor
You can browse around the Store Editor by clicking Nav-buttons, thumbnail
images, and text links just as you would on any other Web site:
 Click navigation buttons or icons and text links to find the page you
want to edit. Clicking buttons or icons is the easiest way to get around
inside the Store Editor and is very easy to do on a small site with a few
sections. However, if your site has thousands of products and hundreds
of section pages, navigating this way is more difficult.
 Add Up and Next buttons to your Nav-buttons (under Variables: Nav-
buttons) to make it easy to browse from one product to the next
within the same section. See Chapter 10 for more on buttoning down
your store’s navigation.
 Browse around on the Contents (site map) page. Contents displays the
ID (linked to the page in Edit mode), Type, Template, and Contents of
every page (object) of your store.
Figure 9-3 shows the Contents page, which displays the entire navigational
structure of your store with an expandable site map. Your home page
(ID:index) is at the very top of the hierarchy. All the top-level section pages
(pages in the Contents field of your home page) appear directly below the
home page. These top-level sections are arranged in the order that the pages
appear on your site.
On the Contents page, when a section page (parent) contains other pages
(children), the IDs of the these child-pages appear below the parent page as
links to the pages in the Store Editor. It looks scarier than it is. After you get
the hang of it, it’s pretty easy to navigate.
You can expand and contract your store’s site map by clicking the + or – sign
to see the contents of each section. Click the + button to the left of the ID to
expand the site map to see all the pages inside that parent page. Click the –
button to hide the contents. A Show Parents button appears when an ID is in
multiple sections. Click that button to see all the parent object-IDs with links
to those pages.
At the bottom of the Contents page are the orphaned pages, which are pages
not inside any other page. Because they aren’t linked from another page, it
seems almost impossible to find these orphaned pages by browsing about the
site. Every so often, I scroll down to the bottom of the Contents page, click the
first orphaned ID to see what the page is about, and figure out whether it
needs be placed within a section page or simply deleted. You can always cut
the orphaned page to the Clipboard and move it to a section page. See
Chapter 12 for more info.
132
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Finding pages by knowing the ID
When you know the ID of a page, you can use the Find button to jump to that
page instead of browsing around in the Store Editor to get to it. As long as you
know the ID, you can even find IDs of objects that are cut to the Clipboard or
orphaned. To use the Find button, first you need to turn it on under the
Controls page in the Store Editor by setting Show Find Button to Yes. Click
the Find button on the Edit Nav-bar, which zips you over to the Find By ID
page. Type the ID of the page you want to find and click the Find button, and
the page magically appears.
You must type the ID in lowercase letters and make sure that no space
appears at the end.
Bookmarking Editor pages 
with consistent URLs
I got this tip from long-time Yahoo! Store developer Brian Bock (www.bock.
com). You can bookmark pages in the Editor to save time and trouble. First,
Figure 9-3:
The
Contents
page, or site
map, is
where you
can see 
the entire
hierarchy of
your online
store.
133
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

go to the Controls page and set your Editor Entry page to the home page, and
then use these direct Editor URLs to jump straight to any ID in the Editor.
These URLs work as long as you’re logged in to your Yahoo! ID and that ID
has permission (under the Store Manager’s Access link) to access your Store
Editor. Here’s the format for direct URLs linking to specific IDs:
http://edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/NEWEDIT.yourstoreaccount/id.html
Setting properties on the Config page
The Config button takes you to a page where you change your Store Editor’s
settings and Leaf configurations and set the default types and templates. Set
the Edit-button-position to Top. If you use custom Types and Templates, set
the default items and sections to match those custom Types and Templates;
otherwise, do not touch these settings. Config is also where you configure
how your Leafed pages look. I cover this topic in Chapter 11, where I talk
about the many different looks of section pages.
Setting the Controls for the Editor
Figure 9-4 displays the Controls page, which contains helpful tools and set-
tings for the Editor. This page shows the last time you published the store
with a time and date stamp and shows any error messages.
Tweak your Controls page to save time and energy, as well as eliminate need-
less clicks, so that your Store Editor is ready to rock from the moment you
log in. Here are my favorite settings for Controls:
 Set the Default Editor Mode to Advanced to have access to every Editor
feature.
 Set Site Buttons to Yes so that you see the Publish and Manager buttons
on every page.
 Leave the Editor Entry Page set to the home page so that you can book-
mark Editor URLs.
 Don’t use the Look and Layout buttons because they can mess up 
your store.
 Set Show Find Button to Yes because Find is the easiest way to jump to a
page when you know the ID.
 Set Color Code Input to your preference. To me, the color white is 255
255 255 (not #ffffff), so I use Decimal color.
 Set Index Page Size to 50 or 100, which is better for search engines. I talk
a lot more about search engines in Chapter 19.
134
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Keep Use S-Key Authentication set to No unless you want to type your
Security Key about once an hour. It’s good security for the Editor if you
need it.
 Search Objects By Some Property is a really cool feature. You can search
the various fields (Name, Code, Caption, Abstract, Contents, Headline,
Ship-weight) of every ID to see which IDs either contain something,
equal something, are empty, or are nonempty. It’s really great when you
know you have a page named something-something-8675309 and just
can’t find it!
 Multiple Image Upload is where you upload your .zip files full of images
named the same as the ID you want them to upload to. I cover image
uploads in Chapter 8.
 Edit by ID is pretty handy when you’ve done something (with a broken
table or JavaScript) that makes the page not load and not show the Edit
Nav-bar.
Controlling Look and Feel with Variables
Setting global Variables isn’t something you do every day, but you’ll live on
this page the first time you set up your store’s look and feel. I cover the 
Figure 9-4:
The Controls
page has all
kinds of nifty
features for
customizing
your Store
Editor.
135
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

various Variables in great detail throughout the book, but here’s an overview
of all the Variables with references to the chapters that contain the nitty-
gritty information.
Click the Variables button to go to the Variables page (see Figure 9-5) where
you can change all kinds of parameters to control the look and feel of your
Yahoo! Store.
Clicking the Help button causes a helpful definition for each setting to appear.
Also, see the Help page at http://help.yahoo.com/us/store/edit/
variables/variables-01.html for more info.
 Title: Change the Title to the name of your company and/or your
domain. The default is your domain name or your account name. The
Title appears in the banner text on the top of every page until you
upload a Name-image graphic. This text also appears in multiple places
across the site, especially in the old Shopping Cart and Checkout, so be
careful what you type here!
 Email: This e-mail address is the official site’s e-mail address and
appears on the info.html page.
Figure 9-5:

Variables
page is

settings that

136
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Colors and typefaces
Believe it or not, variables in the Colors and Typefaces section control the
appearance of various hues and fonts across the site. It’s electric!
 Background-color: Use white (255 255 255) or a very light gray.
 Background-image: Don’t use a background image. It makes the text
hard to read.
 Text-color: Use black or a very dark color.
 Link-color: Use blue or a color that matches your logo.
 Visited-link-color: Use a color that’s darker than your link color.
 Display-text-color: Pick the color of your headlines.
 Display-font: Choose a font from the drop-down menu from the many,
many fonts. I prefer Syntax-bold.
 Display-font-size: Measured in points. Choose anywhere from 16- to 36-
point type.
 Text-font: Choose an HTML font face for Captions and link text. I like
Verdana or Arial. Times, Helvetica, and Georgia work, too.
 Text-size: Choose an HTML font size. The default is 2, and I also like 3.
 Label-color, Label-font, and Label-font-size variables: Control the look
of the Specials on the front page if you choose As-Thumbnails for the
Specials-format. For more on these Variables and Specials, read Chapter 13.
 Banner-font-size: Overrides the banner font size, which is based on the
length of your domain name. Instead of using this field, upload a name-
image header graphic (about 650 x 75 pixels). To me, banner fonts look
really unprofessional. The color of the banner is the same color as the
home-button-text-color.
 Emphasis-color: Determines the -color for the Price if your Price-style
isn’t set to Quiet.
Buttons get their own chapter! Chapter 10 covers Button-color, Button-text-
color, Button-font, Button-font-size, Button-padding, Button-edge-width,
Button-edge-color, Home-button-color, Home-button-text-color, Home-button-
font, and Home-button-font-size.
Image dimensions
I fully cover images and Image Dimensions Variables in Chapter 8, including
Thumb-height and Thumb-width, Inset-height and Inset-width, and Item-
height and Item-width.
137
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

Page layout
Page Layout variables determine how your pages look, how thumbnails and
product links display, and which elements show on the various pages. If a
page has Leaf set to Yes, then these settings are overridden by the settings
on the Config page, covered earlier in this chapter in the section “Setting
properties on the Config page.”
 Page-format: Determines whether your buttons go on the top or along
the side.
 Page-width: Set in pixels. I keep my pages less than 800 pixels wide.
 Name-image: Clicking the Name-image graphic takes you to the home
page. The Name-image appears as the header on every page and serves
as both branding and functionality, which makes it your most important
graphic. Upload a 750-x-75-pixel Name-image for Top-button stores, or a
600-x-75-pixel Name-image for Side-button stores).
 Head-elements: Controls whether Image and/or Display-text-title (the
Name/Headline) appear on nonleafed pages. Sometimes I don’t display
Image to free up screen real estate on section pages.
 Head-style: Determines the alignment of the Head-elements, the Image,
and the Headline. I prefer left-aligned pages, but right-aligned works, too.
Using Centered eats up a lot of space on product pages, so I don’t use it.
 Columns: Controls how many products are in each row. I prefer three or
five. More items per column displays more products per screen shot.
 Column-width: Determines how tight your columns look. Fixed makes all
your columns the same width. Variable makes columns with items with
more text wider, so the pages breathe a little more.
 Row-pad: This is the space (in pixels) between rows. The default is 
15 pixels.
 Contents-elements: Determines which elements show on nonleafed sec-
tion pages, which I talk about a lot more in Chapter 11. I select Image,
Screen-text-title, and Price for nonleafed section pages. Select or dese-
lect multiple options in the list box by holding the Ctrl key (Mac: the Ú
key) and clicking elements on or off with your mouse.
 Contents-format: Use Vertical for nonleafed section pages because sec-
tions display vertically centered thumbnail image, text link, and price 
(if it’s an item) in minimal space. Vertical allows you to get more prod-
ucts in the first screen shot, above the fold. Ell displays the text link to
the right of the thumbnail in a separate column. Wrap is just like Ell, but
138
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

information wraps around the thumbnail in the same column, and Pack
displays the image full-size, with no border or space between elements.
 Bullet-image: Use the image field to upload a custom image to replace
the bullet.
Button properties
For more on navigation buttons and related Variables, check out Chapter 10,
which is dedicated to navigating button Variables.
Some properties are only used for some settings. For example, if you use
Button-style:Icon with custom images for buttons, you can upload GIF files to
these image Variables: Up-image, Next-image, Show-order-image, Home-image,
Info-image, Privacypolicy-image, Help-image, Search-image, Index-image,
Download-image, Register-image, Request-image, Email-image, and Mall-
image.
Here are the Button properties you need to know about and what they do:
 Button-style: Select Text, Solid, Incised, or Icon (Custom images).
 Nav-buttons: Determines what buttons show up on your Nav-bar. I like to
use Home, Show-order, Info, Empty, Contents, and sometimes Up and
Next. I don’t really use Help, Index, Register, Mall, Download, Search,
Privacypolicy, Request, or Email.
 Mall-url: If you use the Mall button (which links to Yahoo! Shopping by
default), you can change the URL here. I don’t use this field unless I need
the Mall-button to link to another related site.
 Info-text: This is the text on your Info button. For Top-buttons, I use
“Info” because it’s short. For Side-buttons, I use “Shipping Info” or
“Shipping Information.”
 Request-text: This is the text on your Catalog Request button. Don’t use
this button because the Catalog Request form is very clunky.
 Privacypolicy-text: This is the text on your Privacy Policy button. Don’t
use this button because Nav-bar real estate is so valuable. Instead, link
to your privacypolicy.html page in your Final-text field with something
like this:
<a href=privacypolicy.html>Privacy Guarantee</a>
139
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

Page properties
Variables under Page properties control the text in four fields. Really take
advantage of your Final-text field and carefully choose how you present your
contact information and links to shipping and ordering info.
 Keywords: Whatever words you put in here go in your Keywords meta-
tags on your home page.
 Head-tags: Lets you put HTML code inside your Head-tags field. Use for
CSS, for JavaScript, or to call external files, such as third-party tracking
scripts. Please don’t override this variable if you can help it because one
day you’ll have to undo all that hard work. Trust me. The Head-tags vari-
able is only visible in the Advanced mode of Store Editor.
 Final-text: This text-field is at the bottom of every page. On standard
template stores, I load this field with contact information, text links, a
search box, trust symbols, and anything else I think customers need to
see before they buy from me.
 Address-phone: A text field used on the home page if selected in the
Page-elements field. See Chapter 11 for more on the home page.
Store properties
Variables in Store properties control the appearance of order functionality,
such as the way prices look, the way options appear, and what text appears
on your Order buttons. If you change only one thing on the Variables page,
please change the Order-text from Order to Add To Cart. One guy who read
my blog fixed his Order button and tripled his sales with no increase in traf-
fic. Of course, your mileage may vary. . . .
 Price-style: Determines the formatting of prices. I prefer Normal or Big.
Quiet does not show the price on section pages. Normal uses emphasis
color for the color of price. Big uses Display-text for prices, which may
be too much for some stores.
 Regular-price-text: Text that appears before the Price only when there’s
a Sale-price. I prefer Retail, MSRP, List, Catalog, or similar language.
 Sale-price-text: Text that appears before the Sale-price when there’s a
Sale-price. I prefer a call to action (a phrase telling someone to do some-
thing) or words that add value, such as “Order yours for,” “Only,” or
“You pay,” “Ships Free for only,” “Save at,” and so on.
140
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Order-style: Determines how options appear. Normal just lets the
options fall where they may, depending on the length of the text. Two-
line kicks all the options down to the second row. Multiline kicks each
option down to a separate line, which looks better for stores with prod-
ucts that have a lots of options.
 Secure-basket: Determines whether the old cart is on a secure server.
The default is No. If you select Yes, you move your Shopping Cart to a
secure server. At first, this sounds like a pretty good idea, but it’s not
because you really need a secure server for Checkout pages, where cus-
tomers enter personal information and credit-card info. Shopping Cart
pages contain only product information. Secure servers are much, much
slower than regular servers because they have to verify and encrypt
every little thing, which only slows down the shopping process and cuts
into your sales.
 Compound-name: Selecting Yes adds the section name to the product
name in the Cart and Checkout.
 Order-text: Text that appears on the Order button on Product pages.
Please, please, please change this text to Add To My Cart or Add To My
Shopping Cart because it converts at a much higher rate than Buy or
Order.
 Show-order-text: Text that appears on the Show-order button. I prefer
Show Cart or Show My Cart. Make this wording match what you call the
Cart (basket, order, whatever) in Order-text.
 Families: A field for legacy stores for cross-selling.
 Cross-sell-text: Text that appears in the cart above your cross-sell items.
I prefer “Related items:” or “Customer also bought these products:”.
 Currency: A currency symbol. Put the almighty $ here.
 Thousands-mark: Use a comma unless you’re in Europe.
 Decimal-mark: Use the period unless you’re in Europe.
 Quantity-text: Change to “ for “ (without the quotes, but with a space
before and after). Text appears on quantity pricing. It looks better to me
than a slash.
 Minimum-order: Set a dollar amount for your minimum order. I prefer to
let my shipping cost fix piddly orders. If someone wants to order a $1.25
nameplate and pay $5.95 for shipping, so be it.
 Minimum-quantity: Set a minimum quantity for orders.
 Availability: Choose a global standard delivery time. You can override
this variable on custom or drop-ship items.
141
Chapter 9: Store Building with the Store Editor

 Need-ship: Set to No if you don’t ship products (e-books, newsletter sub-
scriptions, donations, and so on).
 Need-bill: Override to No on free items.
 Need-payment: Override to No for free items.
 Personalization-charge: Lets you charge for monograms.
 Ypath: Sets the category for Yahoo! Shopping.
 Shopping-url: Ancient field that’s no longer used.
Custom variables
If you have custom RTML templates using custom fields, you can create new
properties on the Variables page. Click the Define New Variable button, name
your field, and select the field type, and your custom fields appear at the
bottom of the Variables page. See Chapter 26 for more on RTML.

N
avigation bars give form and function to your online store. These but-
tons provide navigation and define the look and layout of your Yahoo!
Store. The buttons allow shoppers to navigate your Web store and buy things.
The Store Editor has built-in navigation button bars that link to your top-level
categories (sections) and to major store functions, including your home
page, info page, Shopping Cart/Checkout, and more.
Navigation buttons are easy to edit, configure, and customize to match the
look and feel of your site. You can make a good-looking online store that’s
easy to navigate with just a few tweaks to the Variables page.
In this chapter, I’m really going to press your buttons. I explain the differ-
ences between top and side buttons, compare Contents and Function but-
tons, show you how to control which buttons appear and in what order, look
at the various Variables that control the look and feel of standard buttons,
and show you a few tricks to customize your store. Max out your Yahoo!
Store with standard Store Editor templates without ever touching or cus-
tomizing RTML (or even knowing what that means).
Navigating Yahoo! Store Buttons
Store navigation is extremely important because the easier you make it to
navigate your store, the more products people look at. The more products
people look at, the more stuff you sell. Standard Yahoo! Store navigation buttons
are easy to create and edit. You use them to create a professional-looking,
easy-to-navigate storefront. You control where the buttons appear on the

page, which buttons appear, and in what order. You choose the button colors,
the font and size of the button text, and even the words that appear on the
buttons. You can even create a custom look by uploading graphic buttons.
Call them navigation bars, navigation buttons, Nav-bars, or button bars, but
whatever the name, navigation buttons do many things:
 Navigation buttons are the most important design element on a standard
Yahoo! Store. They determine the look of the store with button colors
and fonts.
 Buttons frame your store, too. They determine the width of the store by
the number of buttons in your navigation bar, text on the buttons,
button-font-size, and spacing between buttons.
 Buttons brand the store on every page with your logo and company
colors and fonts.
 Navigation buttons link to your major product categories — the top-level
products and sections on your home page.
 Buttons link to Yahoo! Store’s prebuilt function pages (info, show-order,
search, and so on).
 Navigation buttons let your customers navigate your online store, but
they also work in the Store Editor.
Figure 10-1 shows an example of Yahoo! Store with the Page-format set to
Side-buttons side-by-side with the same store with the Page-format set to
Top-buttons. Notice that the Side-buttons store has room for five or six sec-
tion buttons, but the Top-buttons store has fewer section buttons with much
less screen real estate eaten up by navigation. Everything’s a trade-off!

Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Exploring the Different Types of Buttons
Yahoo! Store gives you two types of buttons:
 Function buttons link to the various prebuilt Yahoo! Store function
pages, such as your Shopping Cart, your store’s search page, its alpha-
betical index, and so on. Every Yahoo! Store has these function pages,
whether you use them or not.
 Contents buttons are the buttons that link to your top-level navigation
and mirror whatever sections or products you put on your home page.
Function buttons
Your Yahoo! Store’s 15 Function buttons are the most important navigational
elements of your store. Every single page of any online store needs a link to
the home page, a link to customer service information, and access to the
Shopping Cart. Store Editor’s navigation buttons make this easy.
A Home button gets folks to the home page, which they can use as a starting
point for navigating your store. An Info button links to your store’s info.html
page and lets customers read your terms and conditions, shipping methods,
and payment methods and provides full contact information to give even the
most skeptical customer a reason to trust and buy from you. A very prominent
Show Order button links to your store’s Shopping Cart and secure checkout,
which makes shopping easy and reminds customers to buy what they stuck
in their cart.
Paul Graham (the creator of Viaweb, now called Yahoo! Store) and his team
did a really good job of building these store functions into the Editor soft-
ware. The Store Editor makes it easy to add the functionality you want and
remove the functionality you don’t want because buttons are easy to turn on
and off in the Variables page.
Variables are global settings that affect the entire site. For example, when you
click the Variables button in the Edit Nav-bar, make the Button-color property
0 0 0 (black), and click the Update button, suddenly every single one of your
pages has black buttons. Change your mind, click the Variables button,
change it to 0 0 255 (blue), and click the Update button, and now, every single
one of your pages has blue buttons. I talk about Variables ad nauseum in
Chapter 9.
I’m very picky about what Function buttons I stick on my navigation bar. The
screen real estate taken up by your navigation buttons is extremely valuable
because every page of your store shows these buttons. The more clutter you
have in your navigation bar, the harder it is for your customers to find what
they want.
145
Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

Of the 15 Function buttons, the only Function buttons I must use are Home,
Show-Order, and Info. Sometimes I use the Empty button as a spacer between
my Function buttons and my Contents buttons. Sometimes I use the Up and
Next buttons for easier browsing if my store has Top-buttons.
Usually, I prefer to have my Page-format variable set to Side-buttons. Under
Variables, I set my Nav-bar to show Home (1), Show-Order (2), Info (3), 
Empty (4), and Contents (5). I don’t use the rest of the Yahoo! Store Function
buttons, but I do link to some of the function pages at the bottom of every
page in my footer (found in the Final-text field on the Variables page).
Figure 10-2 shows all 15 Store Editor Function buttons on a Top-buttons store
in an alphabetical list as follows. Notice that just a space appears in the
Empty button spot.
 Download: This button is for stores who sell downloadable products,
such as PDF files, MP3 files, and so on. The Download button links to the
Order Confirmation page, which displays a link to download the file after
someone has made a purchase.
 Email: This button creates a mailto: link to the e-mail address entered
under the Email field under Variables.
Clicking a mailto: link automatically opens the default e-mail software
on a PC. I prefer to have the e-mail address at the bottom of every page
by sticking a text link in the Final-text field under Variables like this:
<a href=mailto:email@yourdomain.com>email@yourdomain.com</a>

Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Empty: This creates an empty space on the navigation bar, which works
as a divider between your Function buttons and Contents buttons.
On Top-buttons stores, I use it as the second-to-last button to separate
the Up and Next buttons from the other Function buttons for easier
browsing.
 Help: This button links to the Yahoo! Store Help For Buyers Ordering
page, which tells shoppers how to find something, how to buy some-
thing, what to do when problems occur, and more.
 Home: This button is a link to your home page or index.html. When
you have Side-buttons, the word Home appears on the button. When you
have Top-buttons, the text in your Variables: Title field appears on the
button. You can also upload a custom image (such as a logo) to the
Home-image field under Variables. If you don’t upload a custom image,
you control the look of the home-button with the fields home-button-color,
home-button-font, home-button-text-color, and home-button-text-size.
 Index: This button links to the alphabetical index, or ind.html, page.
Every Yahoo! Store has one whether or not it has the button.
 Info: This button links to your info.html page, where you put your con-
tact info, shipping information, and terms and conditions. The text on
this button comes from the Info-text variable, and the default text is Info.
 Mall: This button links to the URL in your Mall-URL field under variables.
By default, that URL points to Yahoo! Shopping and displays a Yahoo!
Shopping logo. Replace this logo by uploading a new image to the Mall-
image field under Variables.
 Next: This button links to the next object in the Contents field of this
object’s parent section. For example, if you were on the first product
inside a section of 20 products, clicking the Next button takes you to the
second product. The Next button is a great way to make your products
and sections easier to browse.
 Privacypolicy: This button links to your privacypolicy.html page.
The text on this button comes from the Privacypolicy-text setting on the
Variables page, and the default text is Privacy Policy.
Yahoo! requires you to have a page that explains how you collect, use,
and distribute private customer information. I prefer to not use this
button and have a text link in the footer of every page by using the Final-
text field under Variables. Protecting your customers’ privacy is
extremely important, but a link to your privacy policy page belongs at
the bottom of the page, not in your navigation bar. To link to your 
privacypolicy.html page, copy this code:
<a href=privacypolicy.html>Privacy</a>
 Register: This button links to the register login screen, which is still
used by some ancient Yahoo! Store owners (like me). The new Checkout
Manager is not compatible with the old Register function, so don’t use it.
147
Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

 Request: This button links to your Catalog-Request form. Because you
can’t do a lot of customization with your catalog request form, I seldom
use this button or the form. The text on this button comes from the
Request-text setting under Variables, and the default text is Request
Catalog.
 Search: This button links to nsearch.html, which is the default search
page on every Yahoo! Store. I never use this button because I prefer to
have search functionality on every store page. I stick a snippet of code
in the Final-text field under Variables by placing this little bit of HTML
code, which calls a search box:
<form name=vw-form method=post
action=”http://search.store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/nsearch”>
<input type=hidden name=vwcatalog value=storeaccountnamehere>
<input name=query type=text size=30><input type=submit value=Search>
</form>
 Show-order: This button links to your Shopping Cart at http://order.
store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/wg-order?youraccountnamehere or
the new checkout Shopping Cart. The text on this button comes from
the Variable Show-order-text, and the default text is Show Order. I like to
make my Show-order-text say Show My Cart.
 Up: This button links to the parent page of the current page you’re on.
For example, on a product page, this button links up to the section page.
On a top-level section page, the Up button links to the home page. If the
current page has no parent page, this button does nothing. I like to use
Up and Next buttons on Top-Buttons stores.
Contents buttons
Figure 10-3 shows the home page of a store with six objects (sections and
products) on the home page and on the navigation buttons. When you create
a product or a section on your home page, Yahoo! Store automatically creates
a button that links to that page in your navigation bar. The text on the button
comes from the Name field of the item or section. Notice that the navigation
buttons are in the same order as IDs in the Contents field.
These navigation buttons are called Contents buttons because the object-IDs
of these sections or products are inside the Contents field of your home page.
You can see the Contents field of your index.html page by browsing to your
home page and clicking the Edit button.
For example, when you’re on the home page and click the Section button in
the Edit Nav-bar to create a new section, Store Editor automatically adds that
top-level section to the navigation bar. If you create a product on the home
page by clicking the Item button, that action also creates a button linking to
that product on the navigation bar.
148
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Evaluate which section pages are your most valuable real estate. Your top-
level sections are usually the pages that get the most page views. I talk a lot
more about deciding which five to seven sections to feature in your naviga-
tion in Chapter 13.
You have to click the Publish button on the home page in Edit mode after
making any changes in the Store Editor to make the published site show the
results of all your labor. If you don’t, you’ll be the only one who can see you
new, improved navigation!
Choosing Page-Format: Top 
Buttons or Side Buttons
Yahoo! Store lets you put your navigation buttons either on top of the store,
or on the left side of the store. You control this placement with the property
Page-format, which is found on the Variables page. Side buttons and Top but-
tons are very different looks for your store, and each has pluses and minuses:
 Side buttons visually anchor the page to the left and give you plenty of
room to list your major categories down the left-hand side (up to 30 but-
tons, in total).
 Top buttons center the page and take up much less real estate, but give
you virtually no room to promote categories.
In this section, I talk about what I like and don’t like about both settings.

Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

Side buttons
When you open your Yahoo! Store account, your Store Editor’s Page-format is
set to Side-buttons by default. Side buttons are pretty hard to screw up,
which is probably why it’s the default setting. (I’ve seen some people do
some pretty horrible things to Yahoo! Store navigation bars!)
Here are several solutions for Side-buttons stores:
 Show how many types of cool things you sell. Maximize your Side-
buttons real estate with this Side-buttons recipe: I prefer to have the
Nav-buttons field show Home (1), Info (2), Show-order (3), Empty (4),
and Contents (5). Sometimes I stick the Next (5) button right after all the
Contents buttons for easier browsing.
 Use short names for top-level products and sections. Really long sec-
tion names make your navigation bar too wide. Because the text in the
Name field of each top-level section or item is also used for the text on
Contents buttons, you need to use relatively short names for these sec-
tions or products.
 Show your logo at the top of your navigation. Create a custom graphic
with your logo, 1-800 number, and the word (Home) about 175 pixels
wide. Upload this image as the Home-image under Variables. This Home-
image automatically appears instead of the Home buttons whether or
not you use the Icon setting under Button-Type on the Variables page.
Make sure that the names of your sections aren’t longer than your logo
is wide.
 Make sure that your store is visually balanced. When you use Side-
Buttons, your site can look lopsided. This unbalanced appearance is
especially true if you use a very dark color for your Button-Color or
Button-Edge-Color. Experiment with lighter versions of the color to see
what looks best.
Top buttons
With top buttons, the width of the navigation buttons determines the width
of the site. I like my top buttons to be no wider than 770 pixels and to match
the width of my Name-image. The width of Top-buttons navigation is deter-
mined by many factors, including how many function or Contents buttons
you show, which buttons you show, the text on the buttons, the font size of
the text of the buttons, the Button-padding, and the Button-edge-width.
150
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Keep these tidbits in mind for tip-top Top-buttons:
 To keep your site less than 800 pixels wide, you have to make some
pretty hard choices about which buttons get that very valuable real
estate. I prefer to show Info (1), Contents (2) with two or three cate-
gories at most, Show-order (3), Empty (4), Up (5), and Next (6).
For example, if you have 17 sections on your home page and you use every
single Function button, you can wind up with a six-foot-wide Yahoo! Store.
 Figure 10-4 shows that Top buttons don’t need a Home button if you
upload an image to the Name-image under Variables. This graphic
appears above your navigation bar, links to your home page, and is per-
fect for branding your site with a logo as well as using for navigation.
Simply add the word Home to your graphic, and you have an instant
Home button! For example, type Home in 8-point Helvetica type right
below your logo in the Name-image.gif file to make it pull double-duty
as a branding and navigational element. Not using the Home button frees
up extra real estate on a Top-buttons navigation bar for an additional
Contents button, or maybe for a slightly larger font for button text to
make the buttons easier to read.
 Top-buttons make it easy to use Up and Next Function buttons because
you can stick that Next button as the last button in the upper-right
corner. It’s so much easier to browse from product to product, almost
like a slide show. You just keep clicking that Next button. The easier it is
to navigate your store, the more products people look at. The more
products people look at, the more stuff you sell. It’s that easy!

Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

Editing Your Navigation Buttons
Deciding which buttons are on your navigation bar is actually harder than
editing the buttons. You actually control the order of navigation buttons and
which buttons appear on almost every page from three different settings in
two different places in the Store Editor: the Nav-bar property under Variables
and the Contents field and Button property on the Edit page of the home page:
 The Nav-bar property on the Variables page lists all the Function buttons
available (Info, Show-cart, Index, and so on), enables you to control
which Function buttons appear, and lets you determine button order for
every page but the home page. To the right of the property is a Change
button. Clicking the Change button pulls up an edit list, which is an
alphabetical list of all the buttons. (A little field appears off to the right
of each button name.) Number the buttons you want to appear in the
order you want them to appear. Any button without a number doesn’t
show up.
 The home page’s Buttons property acts just like a home-page-only Nav-
bar to let you have different Function buttons on the home page. For
example, you probably don’t want a Home button on your home page.
 You also control where the block of Contents buttons appears by where
you sequence the Contents in the Nav-bar edit list, but the order of
those buttons is determined on the home page by the order of the IDs in
your Contents field.
Working with Function buttons
To add, remove, or change the order of Function buttons (for every page but
the home page), follow these steps:
1. Click the Variables button in the Edit Nav-bar.
The global Variables page appears.
2. Scroll down to the Button Properties section to the Nav-Bar setting.
You see a list of which buttons are showing (separated by commas).
3. Click the Change button.
The Nav-bar’s edit list, an alphabetical list of all the buttons you can
have in a Nav-bar, appears.
Each button has a position field to the right of it that is either empty or
has a number in it. When the position field is empty, the button doesn’t
152
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

show up. When the position field has a number in it, that’s the position
of the button. When the Contents property has a number by it, all the
Contents buttons are in that position. With an edit list, you control
which elements appear and the order in which they appear. You can use
some, all, or none of the buttons.
4. Type the following numbers into the fields to the right of the follow-
ing button names and delete any numbers next to any of the other
buttons: Home (1), Show-order (2), Contents (3), and Info (4); then
click the Update button.
The Variables page reappears, and if you scroll down, you can see that
the Nav-buttons property shows the names of the buttons you selected,
in the order you selected. At this point, you can either change the Nav-
buttons settings again, click the Cancel button at the top of the page to
abort the whole thing, or click the Update button to update your buttons.
5. Scroll to the top of the Variables page and click the Update button to
accept the changes.
Your page appears, and the Nav-bar displays the Home button; the
Show-order button; the Contents buttons: (whatever pages have IDs in
the Contents field of the home page); and the Info button.
Fiddling with Contents buttons
Contents buttons display on the Nav-bar in the same order that the sections
or products appear on the home page, which is determined by the order of
the IDs inside the Contents field of the home page. Change the order of these
object-IDs, and you change the order of the Contents buttons in the naviga-
tion bar.
Note: You need to be in the Store Editor’s Advanced mode to see the Contents
field. You can tell that you’re in Advanced mode because you have a two-row
Edit Nav-bar. If not, click the little red arrow to the right of the Edit Nav-bar.
To change the order of your Contents buttons, all you have to do is change
the order of the object-IDs inside the Contents field of the home page: Edit
the page, type the IDs in the Contents field in the order you want them to
appear, and click the Update button. For example, say that you have five sec-
tions on your home page and in your Nav-bar, and you want to do two things:
remove section 4 and make the fifth section the first button.
Right now, the Contents field of your home page shows the following:
section1 section2 section3 section4 section5
153
Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

All you have to do is change the text inside the Contents field to this and
click the Update button:
section5 section1 section2 section3
Remember that you have to click the Publish button on the home page in Edit
mode to make the published site reflect any changes you make in Store Editor.
Like many things in Store Editor, the home page is a little weird. and I talk
about its various quirks and peculiarities a lot more in Chapter 11. The home
page uses a different template (Home.), which makes the page display differ-
ently. The home page also generates completely different navigation buttons
than the rest of your store using the Buttons property. Buttons control which
Function buttons appear on the home page and the order of those buttons on
the home page’s navigation bar and acts just like its cousin, the Nav-buttons
property (from the Variables page).
Access the Buttons property by clicking the Edit button on the home page.
Click the Change button for an edit list of the available buttons and their
position. Number the buttons that you want to appear in the order you want
and update them. It’s pretty straightforward.
If you’ve made any changes to the Button settings on your home page, editing
your home-page buttons can be very confusing, especially if your home-page
Button property doesn’t show the contents anymore. I prefer that the naviga-
tion on my home page looks like every other page, so I make sure that my
Button settings on the home page match my Nav-bar settings under
Variables.
Overriding Variables is fine for a few notable exceptions, but please, please,
please, do not override variables as a design strategy. A few years ago, I spent
about half of my time on a Yahoo! Store facelift project removing overwritten
variables.
Editing the text on the buttons
Editing the text on Contents buttons is really easy because the text on the
button is the text in the Name field of the section (or item or link) on the
home page.
Editing the text on function buttons is almost as easy because you just go to
Variables and change some text. You can change text on the Info-text,
Privacypolicy-text, Request-text, or Show-order-text. The text on the Home
button is “Home” when Page-format is set to Side-buttons. The text on the
Home button is determined by the Title field under Variables when Page-
format is set to Top-buttons. The rest of the Function buttons cannot be
changed, but you don’t need to use most of them anyway!
154
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Figure 10-5 shows the section page’s Top-buttons with the renamed function
pages.
Editing the Appearance 
of Navigation Buttons
You control the appearance of your store’s navigation buttons on the global
Variables page with several different parameters. You determine which
Function buttons appear and their order with the Nav-buttons fields. Total
customized looks are possible by uploading custom graphics to the Icon
fields for each button.
In print production, 72 points equal an inch. Size your text anywhere from 
8 points to 25 points, depending on what looks good for the font you choose.
Make sure that the font size is large enough to read but not so large as to
screw up your site by making the Nav-bar wider than about 250 pixels for
Side-buttons stores or 770 pixels for Top-buttons stores.
Button-Styles
Here are the basics about selecting Button-styles:
 Choose the Button-style you want: Text, Solid, Incised, or Icon. Figure 10-6
shows top buttons with three different Button-styles: Text, Solid, and
Incised.
• Text buttons are flat with no definition.
• Solid buttons have raised buttons with drop shadows, but the
button-text is flat.
• Incised buttons are raised like Solid buttons, but the text is incised
or cut into the buttons to look more three-dimensional.
If you want people to use your navigation buttons, make the buttons
look clickable. That’s pretty easy! I prefer Solid or Incised buttons
because clickable-looking 3-D buttons tend to get clicked.
Figure 10-5:
Edited 
text on
navigation
button bar.
155
Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

 Text, Solid, and Incised styles are controlled by several Variables set-
tings and show the text from the Name field of the sections on your
home page.
 The Icon Button-style lets you upload your own graphics for much more
control over your store’s look. The Icon or thumbnail image of a section
becomes the graphic for each Contents button. Upload custom images
to the Variables page for every single Function button, (Home-image,
Show-order-image, Info-image, and so on).
Home button variables
Home button variables work the same way that other button variables work.
If you don’t upload a logo to your Home-image, you can make your Home
button have a slightly different Home-button-color, Home-button-text-color,
Home-button-font, and Home-button-font-size.
I recommend uploading a logo to your Home-image, but if you really want 
to use these four variables, make your Home button stand out! Make your Home
button the exact opposite of your other button colors or make the home-button-
font the bold version of the font. Another option is to make the home-button-
font-color a slightly darker or brighter color than your regular buttons.
Button spacing variables
You can build better buttons with these variables:
 Button-padding: The space in pixels inside the buttons between the
button text and the edge of the button.
Figure 10-6:
The three
standard
navigation
Button-
styles are
Text, Solid,
and Incised.
156
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Button-edge-width: The space (in pixels) between the buttons on all
four sides. The default is 0. 
 Button-edge-color: With Top-buttons, if there’s no Button-edge-width,
the Button-edge-color doesn’t show. With Side-buttons, the Button-edge-
color determines the color of the left stripe behind the navigation but-
tons. Make your Button-edge-color slightly lighter than the Button-color
to get the buttons to pop off the page.
Creating a Custom Look 
with Icon Buttons
Yahoo! Store gives you some very cool options using Icon buttons to get a
custom look for your store without ever touching RTML (see Chapter 26).
First, you build your store with standard navigation buttons and then use
that layout as the foundation for a design using custom Icon buttons. It 
doesn’t matter whether you use top or side buttons.
Take a screen shot of an existing Yahoo! Store and build a custom façade right
on top of the foundation with your graphics software. After the design is com-
plete in your graphics software, all you do is save it as a GIF file, reopen it,
and chop up the buttons for each Contents and Function button. Then
upload the images to the Icon fields for each section and Function button and
switch the Variable Button-style to Icon, and you’re all done.
Figure 10-7 shows you the same navigation bar in four different phases. First
you see the standard navigation bar, where the Page-format is set to Top-
buttons. The Nav-bar is set to Home, Contents (with three section pages),
Info, Show-order, Up, and Next. Button-style is set to Incised. These settings
create a pretty standard navigation bar.
The second image shows the same navigation bar as seen in a graphics pro-
gram with a 50-x-750-pixel rectangle drawn around it and with vertical lines
showing the different buttons.
The third image is the same navigation bar with the vertical button dividers
shifted around a little to give less space to the Home button and spread the
real estate around a little. The fourth image shows the final design in the graph-
ics program, and the white space makes it easy to see the different buttons.
157
Chapter 10: Pushing All the Right Buttons

Custom Function buttons
You can create and upload a custom graphic to each Function button on the
Variables page, including Up-image, Next-image, Show-order-image, Home-
image, Info-image, Privacypolicy-image, Help-image, Search-image, Index-
image, Download-image, Register-image, Request-image, Email-image, and
Mall-image.
Custom Contents buttons
You can also create and upload custom graphics for each Contents button for
your custom Icon navigation bar. Simply upload the custom Icon button to
the Icon field on each top-level section on your home page. I think you should
know the following before creating a custom look with eye-popping Icons:
 When you select Icon as the Button-style, Yahoo! Store automatically
puts the Icon for that section where the button goes. If you don’t upload
an image to the Icon field on a section, the Store Editor places the
thumbnail of the image for that section, which can look really strange.
 If the section has no image uploaded to the Image or Icon field, then the
Store Editor centers the text in the name field just like a flat-looking text
button.
When you use Icon buttons, you really need to create custom graphics that fit
the navigation bar and upload them to the Icon field for each section, or your
store will look really weird.
Figure 10-7:

158
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Making custom icons
Creating custom icons can be kind of complicated. Here are a few more con-
cepts to consider:
 All your buttons have to line up just right. Before you start designing
buttons, figure out exactly how much screen real estate you’re willing to
give up for your navigation. Your navigation needs to be large enough to
be easy to use, but no larger. Make your Icon buttons around 50 to 75
pixels tall, and make sure that the total width of the Nav-bar is some-
where between 750 and 780 pixels. Sometimes overly ambitious custom
navigation pushes the Order button below the first screen shot on prod-
uct pages, which is bad!
 I like to take a screen shot of my site with simple text buttons and design
custom Icon buttons on top of those text buttons. I use Paintshop Pro,
which is a poor man’s version of Adobe Photoshop. I create a single GIF
image, compress the heck out of it, chop it up into the various Contents
and Function buttons, and then upload it. 
Most shoppers really need to be able to do only three things: browse back to
the home page, read up on your shipping information page, and then finally,
get back to their Shopping Cart so that they can check out. The Store Editor
makes it easy to add the buttons you want and make them look they way you
want without knowing a lick of HTML.

Designing All Kinds of Pages
In This Chapter
 Producing other pages that sell
 Homing in on the perfect front page
 Selling with section pages
 Informing customers with friendly FAQ pages
W
hen most folks think of designing an online store, they think of produc-
ing product pages. While products get all the attention (and sales),
shoppers would never make it to the product pages or be able to buy without
the other types of pages that organize these products and make shopping pos-
sible: the home page, section pages, shipping info page, Shopping Cart, inter-
nal store search results page, and several other built-in function pages.
Your home page is the most important page on your site. Designing a home
page is hard enough, but wrestling with a totally different template only com-
pounds the confusion. Your info page is second only to the home page for
giving customers the confidence to buy. You can display products on section
pages in so many different ways that it sometimes makes my head hurt.
In this chapter, I share with you what I’ve learned in eight-plus years of using
the Yahoo! Store Editor to create a professional-looking, easy-to-use, customer-
friendly merchandising machine of a home page that search engines love. I
show you how to set up sections that sell, give you the inside scoop on info
pages, and help you format your Function pages: Shopping Cart, search
results page, privacy policy, and the alphabetical index.
Introducing the Home Page
Your home page is the most important page on your Yahoo! Store. It needs to
load fast, look good, and tell prospective customers who you are, what you
do, and how they can find what they’re looking for within seconds. If your
home page doesn’t communicate effectively, you’ll lose valuable traffic and
sales as browsers bail from your store.

Figure 11-1 shows you how a home page serves three completely different
functions: branding, merchandising, and customer service.
 Branding: Your home page must present your company as a credible,
professional store to give shoppers the confidence to buy something.
 Merchandising: Your home page organizes and displays products three
different ways for three different types of shoppers: featured specials on
the front page for frustrated shoppers who need some guidance, a store
search for someone who knows exactly what she’s looking for, and navi-
gation links and buttons for category clickers and browsers.
 Customer service: Your home page should offer fast and friendly cus-
tomer service with text links to help pages, shipping information, and
FAQ pages. It should also give good contact info so that customers with
problems can get a real person on the phone ASAP!
Optimizing begins at home
Your home page is also your most powerful weapon in search engine opti-
mization (SEO). (I dive into SEO in Chapter 19.) If you haven’t already done
the following, these next three points will pay for the price of this book a hun-
dred times over:
 Tweak your title tag for top rankings. Most of the links pointing to your
store point to your home page, which means that your home page has
the highest link popularity (search-engine power) of any of your pages.
Because the title tag is widely accepted as the most important on-page
element for SEO, it’s super-important that the title tag of your home
Figure 11-1:
Your home
page is 
the most
important
page on
your Yahoo!
Store.
162
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

page contain your most valuable keywords to improve your rankings in
the search engines.
Using your company name or domain name as the only text in your
home page’s title tag is bad, second only to not even having a title tag at
all. A good title tag needs four or five of your top keyword phrases
arranged in a compelling sentence. Your home page’s title tag comes
from the text inside your Page-title field on the home page. For example,
my page’s title tag on www.YstoreBooks.com is Yahoo! Stores For
Dummies: Yahoo! Merchant Solutions and Store Editor tips. No RTML
required at YstoreBooks.com.
 Use your best keywords in text on your home page. Use the Message
field and Intro-text fields to write an overview paragraph of your busi-
ness, but don’t just spew out a list of keywords. Establish your exper-
tise. Write about what you sell, why you sell it, and why folks should buy
from you. Compose two- to three-sentence paragraphs summarizing
your section pages, paste the text in the Abstract field on each section,
and then display these Abstracts on the home page.
 Link to your most popular product and section pages on the home
page with descriptive anchor text. Use converting keywords as the
anchor text or link text (words inside the links). These linked words tell
search engines what these pages are about and get your pages higher
rankings in Google, MSN, and Yahoo! search engines. Having popular
keywords link to popular sections on your home page helps customers
get to what they’re searching for even faster.
Designing your home page
You want your home page to match the look of the rest of your site, but 
don’t use the exact same layout because you don’t want it mistaken for just
another page. The Store Editor’s home page template (home.) is structurally
different from other Store Editor pages and gives you a lot more flexibility
than the regular (page.) template. I wish Yahoo! would give the regular sec-
tion and product pages the versatility of the home page template (hint, hint!).
The key to the layout and design of the home page is found in using the vari-
ous Page-elements: Address, Buttons, Contents, Final-text, Image, Intro-text,
Message, Name, Search, and Specials.
Figure 11-2 shows the Edit page for the home page. You can see most of the
home page’s fields, including the Page-elements setting, which is an edit list
just like the Nav-bar setting (see Chapter 10). Click the Change button to the
far right of the Page-elements label on the home page to see (or change) this
list of elements and their position. Place a number in an element’s position
field to make the element show on the home page in the order of the position
number.
163
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

Keep in mind that elements with empty position fields don’t appear. Elements
with the same number display in alphabetical order. These on/off switches on
elements give you an incredible amount of control of the appearance of your
home page.
Think of Page-elements as rearrangeable chunks of content:
 Text chunks: Intro-text, Message, Address/Phone, and Final-text fields
where you can insert limited bits of HTML.
 Image chunks: Image and Name (which either calls the Name-image
graphic or the big ol’ ugly Banner-text) where you can upload images.
 Contents chunks: Thumbnails and links to pages with IDs in the Specials
and Contents fields. Specials can either match the appearance of the
Contents set on the home page’s very own Columns/Contents-elements/
Contents-format or have their own formatting as images with the setting
As-thumbnails. Read extra-special details in Chapter 13.
Figure 11-2:
The Edit
page for 
the home
page is
different
from every
other Edit
page.
164
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Other chunks: Search and Buttons (if you have a Page-format:Top-
buttons store).
The settings on your global Variables page still determine most of the look
and feel of the store, even on the home page. Page-format controls whether
you have navigation buttons on the top or side of your store. The text in
Final-text and Address/Phone fields come from the Variables page.
What’s different about the home page is that some settings are independent
of the Variables settings of the same name (or similar names) so that the
home page can have a unique look:
 Buttons: Instead of using the navigation button bar from the Variable set-
ting Nav-bar, the home page uses the Buttons setting on the home page.
Buttons works the same way as Nav-bar with an Edit position list to
determine which buttons show up and how they are ordered. Chapter 10
is all about the buttons.
Different buttons on the home page make sense for several reasons.
Home-page visitors need different navigation than shoppers deep within
your site. Most folks visit your home page as an entry point to your site
or use your home page to start a new task. Also, you really don’t need a
link to your home page on your home page.
 Contents (and Specials): The home page has its own Contents-format,
Contents-elements, and Columns settings. These settings control how
the contents appear (and sometimes the Specials), and they work the
same way their counterparts on the Variables page do. Remember, top-
level sections appear on the home page because their ID is in the
Contents field of the home page.
Maximizing home-page Page-elements
Prioritize the various elements on your home page. Figure 11-3 shows an
example of how you can present your most important information in the first
500 pixels, the first screen shot of the page (also called above the fold). Any
content for search engines or just less important information goes down
lower on the page.
165
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

Here’s how I make a homerun-hitting home page:  
 Buttons: When I have a store with Top-buttons navigation, I place my
buttons at the very top of my home page for a slightly different look
than my interior pages.
Make sure that you don’t have Home or Up/Next buttons because they
don’t work on the home page.
 Logo/Branding: At the top of the page, I like to have my Name-image
graphic, which is usually 600 x 100 pixels, with logo and tagline, 1-800
number, accepted methods of payment, physical address, and any other
trust symbols I can stick in there without crowding it up too much. See
Chapter 21 for more on creating trust to convert more shoppers into
buyers.
 Specials: After the logo, I like to have a single row of product specials
featuring something new, something at a crazy clearance price, and my
bestsellers, which I try to rotate on a regular basis. Use Specials-
format:As-thumbnails.
 Image and Text: Next, I use my Image (Image-format:Left) and Intro-text
for some customer-friendly text with HTML links to both products and
customer service sections of the site. This text is both customer-friendly
and search-engine friendly. This text and image block is usually about
200 pixels tall. Upload a 200-pixel-tall JPEG for your Image graphic to
make sure that it fits the page and loads faster than a larger-sized image.
Figure 11-3:

page of the
Ystorebooks

Name,
Specials,
Image, and

elements in

screen shot.
166
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Search: I like to show the Search box after the Image and Text (see the
preceding entry). You can do this by calling Search in the Page-elements
field of your home page, but that puts the search box aligned to the left,
which looks a little cockeyed.
A better way to put a search box on your home page without custom
programming is to paste this code into the Message field:
<div align=center><form method=get
action=http://search.store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/nsearch>
<input type=hidden name=catalog value=youraccount>
<input name=query type=text size=30><input type=submit value=”Search”>
</form></div>
Replace your account with your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions account
name or number. For example, my www.ystorebooks.com account is
yhst-17192271484370, but my legacy account for www.robsnell.com is
webstore-design.
 More Text: After the search box, I have a small bit of text in my Message
field and then show my Contents.
 Contents: The home-page template is really cool because it lets you dis-
play your contents differently than on section pages or leafed pages by
using its very own Contents-format/Contents-elements/Columns settings.
I usually choose a “show-’em-what-you-got layout,” where I set Columns
to 1, Contents-format to Ell or Wrap, and Contents-elements to show
Screen-text-title (which is the Name), Image (the thumbnail), Abstract (if
there is one), and Contents (which lists all the subcategories and prod-
ucts within each section). Make sure that each top-level navigation sec-
tion page has a couple of descriptive paragraphs in the Abstract field on
each of those sections.
In addition, here is some other home-page stuff I forgot to squeeze in here:
 Scratch a long-winded welcome message. No one is going to read it. Think
short and sweet, peppered with text links to products and info pages.
 Use a professional photograph featuring a person using what you sell.
Advanced users shouldn’t use the Image field because it’s not a clickable
link to whatever you’re selling. Instead, upload a smallish JPEG image
(200 x 200 pixels or so) to your hosting account and use the Intro-text
field for the HTML. Make it a clickable link going to the product shown in
the photo.
 The Specials field shows all the IDs for items that you’ve selected to be
featured on the front page with the Special/Not Special button. You can
also type or cut and paste IDs into this field for faster editing.
167
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

Selling with Super Section Pages
A section page is really any regular page that doesn’t have an Order button.
Sections usually have items (or other sections) inside them. I have several
kinds of section pages: top-level navigation/master section pages, subsection
pages, and “empty” section pages for additional content pages, such as arti-
cles, buyers’ guides, and reviews.
Top-level section pages usually
contain subsection pages
I like having two different looks for section pages: leafed and not leafed.
Figure 11-4 shows how I don’t mind my leafed section pages resembling my
product pages. A page is leafed when the Leaf setting on the Edit page is set
to Yes, which changes the way the page looks and how the products display.
Instead of using the product display settings under Variables, the template
uses the leafed-product display settings under the Config page. Leafed pages
just give you another way to show products on pages.
A good example of a leafed section page is www.ystorebooks.com/
nav-bar-stuff.html, which shows a section page of sections. Notice how
showing the Abstract gives you more information about what a section is
about.
Figure 11-4:

section page

168
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Here’s how I like to design my section pages:
 I like these master section pages to have nice Caption fields. These
paragraphs of text illustrate my product knowledge and expertise, point-
ing out the key features that solve customer problems.
 I feature my bestselling products with text links inside the Caption
field. This text is search-engine friendly, as well as user friendly, to drive
traffic to my better-selling items.
 Sometimes I use the Abstract field on subsections contained in these
pages. This text points out the differences between the subsections, as
well as adds search-engine-friendly text to my master section pages.
 I also don’t like to use the Image field on a section page. Images tend
to push the products down lower on the page. If I don’t want an image,
but I still want that section to have a thumbnail image, I usually upload
an image to the Icon field.
 Another way to have image-free sections is to upload an image, but
not show it on the section page. Override the Head-elements variable
and set it to show Display-text-title (only) by deselecting the Image.
 To get a different look for my master section pages, I change the Leaf
setting from No to Yes. Under Config, I set Leaf-contents-elements to
Image, Screen-title-text, Abstract, Contents, and Price. I set Leaf-contents-
format to Ell, and I set Leaf-Columns to 1.
The Leaf setting is also a bit confusing for some folks, but leaf it up to me to
explain it: You can tell whether a page is leafed by how product thumbnails
look on that page. For example, on my mom’s site, I can tell that a page is set
to Leaf=No when I see five product thumbnails per row with the links under-
neath. I know a page is leafed (Leaf=Yes) when I see one product thumbnail
per row with the link to the right of the thumbnail, a brief text description of
the item, and text links of the contents underneath that.
Items created with the Item button are leafed by default (the Leaf setting is
set to Yes). Items created both on the Contents page via create New Object
and items created with database uploads are also automatically leafed. Here’s
where I get a little crazy: I like to leaf some section pages, too, especially
when they contain subsections and not just products.
Because I also have the element Contents selected in the Contents-elements
variable, section pages show thumbnails and links to the products, as well 
as links to all the pages inside those pages. For example, if you were on the
Pets section page containing links to the Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Lizards, and
Snakes subsections, links to all the subsection pages appear so that you can
jump straight to pages about Great Danes, German Shepherds, or Yorkshire
Terriers.
169
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

In theory, the average visitor is going to look at four or five pages on your Web
site. The reality is that certain customers look at 15 or 20 pages, while other visi-
tors bail out after the first page view. You want to do everything you can to mini-
mize the number of clicks it takes for a visitor to reach your product pages.
Subsections contain products
I want my section pages to show the wide variety of products that I carry,
and Figure 11-5 shows how subsection pages that display tons of products
allow me to show the depth of my inventory in the first screen shot.
Here are a few tips for working with section pages:
 I really like to show the price on section pages. Displaying the price on
section pages keeps folks from having to drill down to the product level
to see the price and then come back up to keep browsing.
 Sometimes I place my products in descending order by price. Because
higher-priced items appear before lower-priced items, more expensive
items have a better shot at getting seen.
 I like to feature my bestselling product in the upper-right corner of
my section page. For example, if I have a five-column layout, the fifth
product is usually my bestseller because that’s the position that gets all
the clicks. Your eye goes straight to it.
Figure 11-5:
This
subsection
page shows
how I like 
to display
more
products in

screen shot.
170
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Here’s what I do on the Variables page to format section pages with items:
 I set Contents-elements to show Image, Screen-title-text, and Price.
 I set Columns to 5 to show five thumbnails on a row.
 I set Contents-format to Vertical, which centers the Name under the
thumbnail and centers the Price and/or Sale-price under that. This way, I
can display the largest number of products in the first screen shot. A
good example is at www.ystorebooks.com/products.html, where I
can see 20 products above the fold on my monitor. The more products
shoppers can see on the first screen shot, the more likely they are to
drill down to the actual product level.
Use empty section pages for content
You can also use empty section pages for content pages, buyers’ guides, 
comparison charts, and reviews. All you have to do is type your text into the
Caption field and upload a picture to the Image field. These content pages
don’t have to contain any products or subsections.
If you need to have super-long descriptions about your product, sometimes
it’s better to actually create separate content pages, such as review pages
and buyers’ guides, than it is to muck up the caption. For example, I like to
have these additional content pages inside the products they talk about,
which means the ID of the “More Info About Product X” page is inside the
Contents field of the Product X item page.
Contents, Contents, Contents, 
and Contents
The word contents means several things in the Yahoo! Store Editor, which can
be very confusing! Remember this tip, and you’ll be fine: Contents really
means only one thing: the stuff inside other stuff.
 Contents usually refers to the field on almost every page (the home
page and every section and item page) that contains the IDs of pages
inside it. Pages with IDs in the Contents field are called parent pages,
and the pages contained within them are referred to as child pages. For
example, a section page called Super-Heroes (the parent) can have the
IDs Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Flash (the children) inside
the Super-Heroes’ Contents field.
171
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

 Contents is also a button on the Edit Nav-bar. This links to the Contents
(site-map) page that displays your entire store’s hierarchy as a list of IDs,
where you can expand and contract IDs to see pages within other pages.
 Contents is also an element inside the navigation buttons. The Viaweb
guys really should have called it Homepage-Contents because it really
refers only to the home page’s Contents field. When Contents is selected
in Variable setting: Nav-bar (and its very similar cousin on the home
page: Buttons), the Store Editor makes a navigation button for every
single page on the home page.
For example, if you have 25 sections on the home page, every single 
section gets its own button. You can always see which IDs are inside the
home page by looking on the Contents (site-map) page or by editing the
home page and scrolling down to see the list of IDs in the Contents field
of the home page.
Now you see why folks easily get confused about the settings that control
how Contents display on various pages. The three settings that control how
sections display items contained within them are Contents-elements,
Contents-format, and Columns:
 The Contents-elements setting literally controls which elements (or
fields) from items in the Contents field show on section pages. The ele-
ments you can choose from are Image (thumbnail), Bullet, Screen-text-
title (text links), Display-text-title (text as an image or display-text),
Abstract, Caption, Price, Order, and Contents.
 The Contents-format setting controls how the elements chosen in
Contents-elements are formatted on the page. Choose Vertical, Ell,
Wrap, or Pack.
 The Columns setting controls how many items appear in the same
row. Set your Columns to an odd number because odd numbers look
more balanced than even numbers. I like three or five items per row.
What is really confusing is that these three settings (Contents-elements,
Contents-format, and Columns) exist in three different places: on the home
page, on the Variables page, and on the Config page under the leaf settings.
The following adds to the confusion about the different types of contents:
 Home page Contents: Pages with IDs inside the Contents field of the
home page appear on the navigation button bars as Contents buttons
(see Chapter 10). If you also want to show thumbnails and text links of
those pages on the home page, such as a regular section page, you have
to turn on Contents under Page-elements. These thumbnails and links
are formatted according to the home page’s own Contents-elements,
Contents-format, and Columns settings.
172
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Section Contents: The Variables settings Contents-elements, Contents-
format, and Columns are easy to see in action because Variables control
the appearance of pages created with the Section button (and here’s the
important part) because the Leaf setting is set to No.
 Item Contents: Item pages (sometimes called product pages) display IDs
inside the contents field differently because the Leaf setting is set to Yes.
 When you create a new page on the Contents page, the Store Editor
doesn’t know whether you’re creating a section page or an item page.
The Store Editor sets the all the item fields to Yes (Orderable, Taxable,
and Leaf), which also happens when you upload “sections,” which the
Yahoo! Help files swear up and down you can’t do. (You can upload sec-
tion info using load files, but it’s confusing and my tech reviewer says
it’s a workaround.) See Chapter 23 for more on database uploads.
 Heaven forbid that you override the Contents-elements, Contents-
format, and/or Columns Variables on a page. When you do, your over-
ridden Variables override the real Variables setting and control how
Contents display, even if the page is leafed.
When you click the Section button to create a new section page, the Store
Editor creates a page where Leaf=No so that the Contents-elements,
Contents-format, and Columns are controlled by those settings on the
Variables page.
The defaults are Contents-elements=Screen-text-title, Image, and Price;
Columns=2; and Contents-format=Ell, which means that on any section page,
pages in the Contents field display two columns per row. If an image exists on
a page contained in Contents, an autogenerated thumbnail appears with the
size determined by the Variables Thumb-height and Thumb-width, and the
text link appears to the right of thumbnail image.
Exploring Other Function Pages
Your Store Editor comes with several prebuilt pages. Here they are with their
ID (and what they are): index (the home page), info (information and poli-
cies), privacypolicy (your privacy policy page), norder (the Shopping Cart
page unless you use the new Checkout Manager), nsearch (the Search page),
and ind (the alphabetical index). I cover the home page in the section
“Introducing the Home Page,” earlier in this chapter. The new Checkout
Manager (see Chapter 14) lets you customize your Shopping Cart and
Checkout in the Store Manager. The following sections contain info on cus-
tomizing the rest of these pages.
173
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

Editing your info page
A complete and professional-looking info page is extremely important. Most
of the folks who are adding items to their carts look over your info page
before placing an order. Figure 11-6 shows a sample of text from an info page
that has stood the test of time since April 1997.
Your info page is linked to from the Shopping Cart and Order Form. This page
is the second-most checked page by shoppers looking to give you money, so
do your info page up right!
Click the Find button on the Edit Nav-bar to go to the Find By ID search form.
Type info in the ID field and click the Find button on the form, which takes
you to the Info page. The Info page’s template (info.) is similar to the regular
(page.) template, but instead of having a Caption field, three text fields are
available: Greeting, Address-phone, and Info. Your e-mail address (from
Variables:Email) also appears on this page before the Info field.
Here’s what I like to do with each field on my Info page:
 Image: Upload your picture or a picture of your warehouse or office.
Anything you can do to look more “real” makes Internet shoppers feel
more comfortable about placing an order with you.
 Greeting: Write what I call a “Howdy!” message. I like to offer a 100 per-
cent satisfaction guarantee, as well as point out what someone needs to

do if he has a problem. You should also talk about how fast orders ship
and discuss product availability.
 Address-phone: List a physical address, all your phone and fax num-
bers, hours of operation, and a contact name.
 Info: Type all your shipping information, policies, terms and conditions,
international shipping info, and answers to frequently asked questions.
The Info field is a smart field, which means that it recognizes the line
breaks you created when you press Enter.
Steal ideas from other good info pages. Ask your lawyer before you post 
anything that may be a binding contract, or you can get in trouble with the
The Man.
Creating your privacy policy page
Yahoo! requires you to post your privacy policy on a page that tells cus-
tomers what information you collect from site visitors, what you plan to do
with this information, and who you share personal information with. Again,
talk to your lawyer, but I think the simpler the policy, the better. Check the
Yahoo! Store Help file at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/
edit/edit-20.html for more info on online privacy or search on your
favorite search engine for writing a privacy policy.
Use language to reassure shoppers that you won’t spam them or sell their
personal information to spammers (if that’s your policy). For example, my
privacy policy is “Your personal information is protected. We do not sell or
rent our customers’ names, addresses, or e-mail addresses to anyone.”
To edit your privacy policy page, click the Find button on the Edit Nav-bar,
which takes you to the Find by ID page. Type privacypolicy in the ID field and
click the Find button to go to the privacy policy page. Click the Edit button,
type your privacy policy into the Info field, and click the Update button.
Editing your Shopping Cart
You don’t really want to mess with your Shopping Cart or norder page,
because what you see in Editor isn’t really what you get on a published site. If
you make any changes to the norder object, publish your site and immedi-
ately place a test order to see what the cart looks like on a real order.
Trying to customize the Shopping Cart is difficult without using custom RTML
templates (see Chapter 26) because there’s no Final-text field or way to put
175
Chapter 11: Designing All Kinds of Pages

custom text in the cart. Fortunately, the new Checkout Manager and Shopping
Cart fix a lot of limitations of the old cart. (Read more in Chapter 14.)
Also, see Chapter 21 for more info on improving your conversion rate. For
example, you can override your Name-image in the Shopping Cart and upload
a more specific graphic designed to complete more carts, something pushing
a special offer or 100 percent satisfaction guarantee.
Editing your store’s Search page
Yahoo! Store has an excellent internal search engine. Store Search looks for
your keyword phrase in the Name, Code, and Caption fields in every page on
the site. Every Yahoo! Store has the same page (nsearch.html) for basic
search. I talk a lot more about how internal store search works in Chapter 7.
Looking at your alphabetical 
index or site map
Every store built with Store Editor has a built-in sitemap/alphabetical index.
The ind.html page lists the name of every page in your store in alphabetical
order and provides links to it.
You can’t directly edit the ind.html page by browsing to it, but you can
always use the Controls: Edit by ID tool. You control how many links appear
on the ind.html page with the Index Page Size setting under Controls in the
Store Editor. Because some search engines (in theory) count up to 100 links
on a page, you’re better off having 50 or 100 links per ind.html page. See
www.yourdomain.com/ind.html for the published version of your index.

Chapter 12
Creating Product Pages 
with the Store Editor
In This Chapter
 Discovering IDs, Objects, Parent-child relationships, and Contents fields
 Creating pages with the click of a (section) button
 Producing product pages that pull in the profits
 Naming names (with keywords) to sell more stuff
 Checking availability, pricing, and all your options (and other item fields)
P
erfecting your product pages is a never-ending project. Converting
browsers into buyers with pages that perform is a priority. Creating a
great item page is a pretty precarious balancing act. Have too little product
info, and prospects don’t purchase. But have big, bloated pages that bury
buyers in BS and you end up with bupkus. In this chapter, I explore object
IDs, which are the building blocks of the pages in the Store Editor. You dis-
cover how to organize and optimize your objects, as well as how to create,
delete, move, and improve your items. Finally, you find out how to get the 
411 on fields.
The look of your product pages depends on two things: the information
inside fields on the page and the settings of the Variables, which control the
formatting. In this chapter, I look at all the product page fields and the kind of
data they hold and explore what you can do with them. I also dissect a prod-
uct page, pointing out the properties, and verify the Variable settings that
control the layout and appearance of the page.
Exploring Store Editor Concepts
My goodness, some of this Store Editor stuff seems complicated! I just want
to sell stuff. Feel free to skip ahead to the next section on creating, editing,
moving, and deleting pages if you don’t feel like thinking right now.

Sometimes you need to work with the Store Editor for a while to get the hang
of these ideas. You really don’t have to understand all these concepts to sell
stuff online using the Store Editor, but finding out about objects and their IDs,
the parent and child relationships between sections and items, and page
organization with Paths and Contents makes using the Store Editor much,
much easier.
Let me see some ID
Every Store Editor page has its very own alphanumeric ID, which is the
unique identifier for that page and is used in the Store Editor for many things:
 The ID is how the Store Editor identifies which page you’re working on
or referring to with links and all other Editor functions.
 The ID determines the Store Editor URL of a page. For example, http://
edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/NEWEDIT.youraccount/id.html.
 The IDs inside the Contents field of a page determine what pages are
inside that section or product page.
 The IDs in the Specials field of the home page determine which pages
are featured as specials.
 The ID of a page serves as the page’s HTML filename on the published
version of the site. For example, the published page for the ID widget-
2000 is found online at www.yourdomain.com/widget-2000.html.
 The ID of a page must be unique and can contain only letters, numbers,
and/or dashes. IDs are not case sensitive. For example, the IDs widget
and WIDGET actually refer to the same page. Links to pages need to have
the ID in lowercase letters, too. For example, a WIDGETS.html link may
work in the Editor but doesn’t on the published site. Link to widgets.
html instead.
 The Find button requires IDs to be typed in lowercase letters.
 Page IDs are permanent, so after an ID is created, you can’t change it. If
you try to create a new page on the Contents page and use an ID that
already exists, the Store Editor is pretty smart and makes the new ID the
old ID plus a 1 or other character.
 If you upload new product information using an existing ID and click the
Add button, the newly uploaded information updates the old product. If
you click the Rebuild button, your store is rebuilt from scratch.
178
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Getting positive ID on 
products and sections
Be consistent when you create the IDs of products and sections. Some retail-
ers use the Code field for the product page IDs, which makes a lot of sense
because Merchant Solutions stores must have unique codes as well.
Here are more tips on how to create good IDs:
 You have little or no control over the page’s ID when you use the
Section or Item buttons to create pages. The Store Editor generates an
ID based upon the first couple of letters of each word you type into the
Name field.
For example, when I manually create a page with the name “Make Good
Product IDs,” the Editor creates a mysterious and unique random ID:
magoprids. A better ID is something like how-to-make-good-product-ids.
 You can trick the Editor. Getting your clients or employees who create
new pages in the Editor to quit using the Item or Section buttons is
almost impossible. I found that you can type up to 14 characters with no
spaces or dashes in the Name field and click the Update button to force
the Editor to use that as the ID.
 You determine a page’s ID when you create pages through database
uploads with the ID field. If no ID field is in the CSV upload, the Editor
uses the Code field as the ID. If no Code field exists, the Editor creates an
ID named gen-sym plus a number.
 You have absolute control over a page’s ID by using the New button
on the Contents page to make a new page. When you create a page
from the Contents page, whatever text you type into the ID field
becomes the object’s ID. The only time this trick doesn’t work is if a
page already exists with the same ID.
Doing a little extra work to write good IDs while you create products and sec-
tions will make your day-to-day management of your store easier. When you
know the ID of a page, you can move products and sections around a lot easier
because you have a pretty good idea what a section contains. For example, IDs
like louisville-baseball-bats are easier to decipher than the mystery of what’s
inside the lobabat section. Read http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/
edit/regular/regular-62.html for more information on IDs and codes.
179
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

Exploring Parent-Child Relationships
The Contents page is a site map and shows the unique relationship between
section pages and item pages, called the parent-child relationship. This metaphor
is used to explain how section pages contain subsection and item pages.
The following bullet list is rated PG. Parental guidance is suggested:
 Item pages exist inside section pages. This is because the IDs of the
items (children) are inside the Contents field of the section page (parent).
 Parent pages usually show child pages with thumbnail images and
text links to those pages. This is an overcomplicated way of saying that
section pages have links and pictures of items inside them.
 Pages can be the child of one page and the parent of another, just like
people. For example, if you have a Books section on your home page
containing ten books, the section page is the child of the index.html or
home page, but is the parent page of the ten item pages. One exception
is that the home page or index page should never be a child page.
 Pages can have an almost unlimited number of parent pages. For
example, imagine that you sell flashlights and have a hundred different
flashlights that all use the same type of D-cell batteries. Instead of creat-
ing a different battery for each flashlight, you can create one item page
with the object ID: d-battery and place this accessory in the Contents
field of each flashlight.
 Some pages don’t have parents and are called orphan pages. Don’t be
sad. They don’t live in orphanages like Little Orphan Annie did, and they
probably get enough porridge to eat. They’re Web pages, not people. You
can find these pages at the bottom of your Contents (site map) page.
 When you move pages, you change the parent-child relationship. For
example, if you accidentally create the Pets section inside the Dogs sec-
tion, you can move the Pets section to the home page and then place the
Dogs section inside the Pets section.
 When you delete a parent page, you also delete all the children pages
inside that page, even if they exist somewhere else. Be careful!
 When you create a section on the home page, you make that section
the child of the home page. When you create a item in a section page,
the item is the child of the parent section page. Pages can be both
parent and child.
 Objects/pages created on the Contents page (the site map) are orphans
the second you create them. You need to place the IDs inside the
Contents field of the parent sections you want them to go in. I cover this
topic in more detail in Chapter 11.
180
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Creating products in the Store Editor and Catalog Manager is almost
exactly same thing. Catalog Manager products have no path information
(where they sit in your Store Manager’s hierarchy), because Catalog
Manager products have no Contents or Path field, but listen to my tech-
nical reviewer, Mike Whitaker, when he says use one way or the other.
 Some pages don’t have children. Some item pages have children, but
the child pages are NIL templates, which are objects that only show their
properties on a parent’s page. For example, when you click the Accessory
button on the Edit Nav-bar of an item page, you create an object that
doesn’t have its own page, but the Accessory can have a Name, Code,
and Price. An Accessory displays product info and (usually) an Order
button on the item page it was created on.
Producing Profits with Product Pages
The appearance of product pages is important. Not only is the information in
the Name, Caption, and Price field important, but the variables that control
how that information is displayed are also sometimes as important.
If you want to see the various fields available on any product page, browse to
your favorite product page and click the Edit button. Click the Types button
on the Edit Nav-bar and click the link for (Item.) type to see all the fields on a
product page:
ID: This field displays the ID for the page and can’t be edited.
Type: This field displays the page’s type, which just means what type of page
it is. The type determines which fields a page has. 
Template: You can edit this field if you want to use custom templates.
Templates determine what information from a page actually shows up on a
page and how it looks. RTML templates are programs that crank out HTML
pages when you click the Publish button. See Chapter 26 for more on RTML.
Name: The name of a page is one of the most important fields because so
many other functions use the text in the Name field as the default. The text in
the Name field does the following things:
 Text from the Name field appears at the top of the product page as a 
display-text headline unless you specify different text inside the Headline
field
 Text from the Name field is used for the Title tag, unless the field Page-
title exists
181
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

 Text from the Name field is used as the anchor text or link text (words in
a link) on its parent section pages where this page appears
 Text from the Name field is also the text in the label by the thumbnail
image when you feature a page on the home page as a Special (unless
you specify different text in the Label field)
 Text from the Name field is used as the text on the Navigation button bar
when a page is a top-level section page (exists on the home page with its
ID in the Contents field of the index.html)
All these reasons are why you should be very descriptive when you enter 
the Name field. For example, naming a product “Hulk T-Shirt” is okay, but
“Incredible Hulk T-Shirt from 1973 Marvel Comics Hulk #108 cover — Green
100% cotton Beefy Tee” is better because it has more keywords that potential
shoppers can type into search engines.
You can’t rank well in the search engines for words that don’t exist on your
store’s pages. Well-written Name fields (think lots of keywords) give you a
better chance to rank well in search engines, as well as Yahoo! Shopping. I
unlock the secrets of keywords in Chapter 16. For Yahoo! Shopping info, jump
to Chapter 17.
Image: You can upload an image file in a GIF or JPEG format of the item here.
Click the Upload File button. Click the Browse button to find the image on
your hard drive. Click the Upload button to send the image file to this item. A
thumbnail image appears so that you can see that you uploaded the right
graphic. (See Chapter 8.)
Code: The code of an item is usually the item’s product ID number or UPC
code or some unique number so that you know exactly what the customer is
ordering. You can search by code. Code is also used in the Cross-sell database.
Price: Not simply a number field, this field can also contain quantity dis-
counts that are automatically calculated by the Shopping Cart. The format is
kind of strange: first the price, then the first quantity break, then the total
price at that quantity, then the next quantity break, and then the total price
at that quantity. For example, to show that T-shirts are $20 each, three or
more are $15 each, and ten or more are $10 each, you type the following in
the Price field:
20 3 45 10 100
Sale-price: If you put the item on sale, list the sale price here. Lots of people
put the list price, or the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), in the
Price field to show the discount that the shopper gets from your Yahoo! Store.
Orderable: This field determines whether an item has an Order button. Set
Orderable to No when you’re temporarily out of stock on an item.
182
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Options: Use this field to specify product options, such as size or color. The
Options field is really cool! The first word on a line is the name of the option.
The second word is the first option in the pull-down menu. For example:
Color RED WHITE BLUE
You need to be aware of the following while exploring your options:
 Option phrases: Put straight quotes ('' '') not curly quotes (“ ”) around
multiple words or phrases for the Options field to treat the phrases as a
single concept. For example:
“Color of Flag” “REDCOAT BLOOD RED”
“ROYAL BLUE” “WHITES OF THEIR EYES WHITE”
 Multiple options: Separate multiple options with two hard returns
(press Enter twice). For example:
Color RED WHITE BLUE
Size SMALL MEDIUM LARGE X-LARGE
 Option upcharge: You can also add an upcharge by putting a plus sign
and the upcharge in parentheses inside an option. For example:
Size SMALL MEDIUM LARGE X-LARGE “XX-LARGE(+$5.00)”
 Inscription: Figure 12-1 shows an example of an Inscription, which is a
specialty Option function, replacing the drop-down menu with an input
field where customers can type information for monogramming or other
personalization. The format for Inscriptions is Option-name Inscription
number, which is the number of characters in the field. For example,
here’s an Inscription for a 20-character dog tag:
“Dog’s Name” Inscription 20
Figure 12-1:
This product
page has
three
options: Last
Name
(which is an
Inscription
field), Size,
and Color,
which shows
an upcharge.
183
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

 Personalization charge: If you want to charge for this added service,
use the Personalization-charge setting under Variables. If different items
have different costs to personalize, just override the Personalization-
charge variable on each product.
Note: In this chapter, I use ALL CAPS to differentiate between the 
options and the name of options. You have the option of not doing that
on your store.
Formatting options can be a little hairy. If you don’t format your options
exactly right, and you have your Store Manager set to validate options (the
default), customers will not be able to check out when they try to order items
with incorrectly formatted option fields.
For this reason, I go into the Store Manager to the Order Settings page and set
the Item Options Validation field to Allow Items With Unrecognized Options.
This setting can be potentially dangerous and allows malicious hackers to
change prices when adding items to the cart, but you shouldn’t have a prob-
lem if you see and/or touch every order. (See Chapter 15 for more about the
Store Manager’s Order Form settings for validating options and formatting.
Also check out http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/store-44.html
for more info on validating options.)
Headline: Anything you type in this field overrides the Name field and appears
as display-text to the right of (or below) the item’s image and above the cap-
tion. I always use the Headline field because of a quirk in the item template. If
you don’t have any text inside the Headline field, the name displays here. If you
do, the template also shows the name to the left of the Order button. This little
trick helps you with search engines. When I do a database upload, I usually use
both Headline and Name fields to take advantage of this “feature.” Eventually, I
try to write a compelling headline for each product that touts the benefits of
buying the product.
The headline is a smart field that recognizes line breaks in text created by
pressing the Enter key within a field. The only other fields that recognize line
breaks in fields and show them on the page are the Label and the Info field on
the Info page.
Figure 12-2 displays a product page. Notice how line breaks in the text help
you tighten up pages with long names or headlines. If a headline is wider than
the space between the right side of the image graphic, then the headline is
kicked down beneath the image. This results in wasted space to the right of
the photograph. I manually insert a couple of hard returns, and I break up
unusually long headlines into phrases of two or three words per line that
make sense.
184
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Caption: This is the description of the item that appears below the Image and
Headline fields. You need to use lots of keywords in several sentences to help
you with the search engines. You also need compelling reasons for your
shoppers to buy this product, so list the benefits of the product.
Abstract: This little-used text field can appear on section pages or on the
home page if you select Abstract in the Contents-elements field. I use the
Abstract to put teaser copy or a synopsis of the caption to pull customers
into a product page. Abstracts look better when the Column variable is set 
to 1 and the Contents-format variable is set to Ell or Wrap. I sometimes use
<small> tags in my Abstracts to make the text a bit smaller.
Icon: You can control what thumbnails appear on section pages with the Icon
field. The Store Editor automatically generates a thumbnail image for every
product or section with an image. The Icon property allows you to customize
your thumbnail by uploading another image. Just like the other thumbnails,
the size of the icon is determined by the Thumb-height and Thumb-width set-
tings under Variables.
Sometimes the autogenerated thumbnails look a little funky. Focus on a par-
ticular product detail or use a logo for an icon to make a better thumbnail.
Icons take more work, and they take a lot of time to upload by hand, but you
can get faster loading and better looking pages. 
Inset: The Store Editor lets you upload a secondary image to a product or
section. Most folks who use this feature upload a small manufacturer’s logo,
about the size of a thumbnail, which appears to the right of the image. You
can also put a detail photo here. Inset-height and Inset-width are set under
Variables.
Label: If you use this field, this text appears on your home page Special when
you select the home page setting Specials-format: As-thumbnails. If you don’t,
the Name field appears on the home page. The Label field is like the Headline
field, which remembers hard returns or line breaks. Break up long lines of
Figure 12-2:

pages.
185
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

text by pressing Enter every two or three words to kick text down to the next
line. If you don’t, long text labels display on one line, which looks weird and
pushes the next Special off the page.
Ship-weight: This field allows you to use the weight-based tables to deter-
mine shipping cost in the Store Manager’s Shipping Manager.
Taxable: If you have set up the tax calculation, you can use this field to
exempt nontaxable items from sales tax.
Download: You can use this field to sell soft goods. Upload a PDF, MP3, or
other file to be downloaded from the Checkout Confirmation page.
Family: This is the old way to cross-sell, or group related products together.
When a customer adds an item with a family to the Shopping Cart, he’s
offered three related items from the same family. See Chapter 13 for more on
the new, much improved cross-sell feature.
Product URL: This field is the URL of the published product page used by
Yahoo! Product Submit for inclusion into Yahoo! Shopping. I talk a lot more
about Yahoo! Shopping in Chapter 17.
Looking at Product Elements
Almost every page on your Store Editor–built store has the same template
showing Nav-buttons, the Name-image header, and the Final-text footer.
What’s unique on a page, or what’s inside the boilerplate template, is what
some folks call the pagelet. With basic templates, items and sections are built
pretty much the same way. I discuss what the properties (fields) are and
what settings control them in the following paragraphs. Here are the ele-
ments in the order that they appear.
Title tag: The Title tag of the page comes from the Name field (unless you
have created a new property named: Page-title, type: text).
Head tags: The Variable: Head-tags allows you to stick code inside your head
tags field. Use it for calling CSS or JavaScripts. Although you can’t see the
code on the page, every HTML page should have a head tags section, which
shows browsers (and search engines) meta or hidden information about the
page’s structure, content, and appearance. It’s not wise to override the Head-
tags variable, even though you need to do so to have unique meta descrip-
tions or meta keywords. If you want to do this kind of SEO, look to RTML for
relatively simple SEO custom programming in Chapter 26.
186
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

The variable Keywords creates a keywords meta-tag on the home page. If you
don’t use custom RTML, feel free to override the Keywords variable on every
page to create a custom keywords meta-tag for each page.
The variable Head-elements determines whether pages show the image
and/or the Display-text-title or neither. The variable Head-style determines
the alignment of the Head-elements. I prefer left-aligned pages, but aligning
your image and text to the right works, too. A center-aligned image eats up 
a lot of real estate on product pages, because it kicks the headline down
under the Image, so I don’t use it. For leafed pages, the -Config’s Leafed-
head-elements and Leafed-head-style setting do the same thing.
Product photo: The image comes from the page’s Image variable, and the
maximum height and width (in pixels) is controlled by the Variables: Item-
height and Item-width. If your image file is taller or wider than these con-
straints, the template generates a smaller version of the image, which you
can click to go to an empty page to see the larger original image.
Unfortunately, this resized image file is reformatted as a GIF file, which is a
pretty heavy file format for photographs. Either upload big images (up to 
600-x-800-pixel JPEGs) with lots of details or right-size all your images to fit
within the Item-height and Item-width settings for faster loading images.
Product headline: The text from the Display-text-title is from the page’s Name
field unless there’s a Headline. The look of the display-text is controlled by the
following variables: Display-text-color, Display-font, and Display-font-size.
Additional photo: If you upload a second image to the Inset image field on a
product, it shows up right under the headline as a thumbnail with the maxi-
mum size set in pixels by the variables Inset-height and Inset-width. Click the
inset image to see the larger uploaded file. I like to upload manufacturer
logos or secondary product photos to the Inset field.
Product description: The Caption field appears next. The font is controlled
by the variables Text-font, Text-size, and Text-color. Captions are HTML text,
which is very search-engine friendly. The caption is a versatile field because
you can insert HTML tags like <strong> tags around keywords to format
your text to look better. You can also add links like <a href=moreinfo.
html>More info</a> into the Caption field.
Order functionality: Next is my favorite part: how folks order. Here you show
the product’s price, product options (such as sizes and colors), quantity dis-
counts, product availability, and an Order button. Sometimes on product
pages with multiple options and quantity pricing, this order functionality can
get kind of hairy-looking.
187
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

Product availability: The Availability variable is a global setting, which is
turned off by default. It’s really good manners and good business to tell cus-
tomers the standard delivery time for a product. Customers hate ordering
something and finding out that you can’t ship it.
Unfortunately, you have to choose an average standard delivery time for all
your products. When you have custom or drop-ship items that may take
longer to ship, you can then override the Availability variable on a product-
by-product basis.
When you select an Availability from the Variables page (or override the
Availability variable), the Store Editor forces you to choose from several dif-
ferent availability messages. There’s gotta be an availability that suits your
business, but if not, database uploads may be for you because they give you
total control over the Availability field. You can upload whatever text you
want. Chapter 23 fully explores database uploads.
Product name: If you have any text in your Headline field, the text inside the
Name field appears here as bold text.
Product code/SKU: The Code field needs to be unique for each item. Codes
appear on the product, Shopping Cart, and Checkout pages, and even in the
order confirmation e-mails. Most people don’t know this, but your store’s
internal search functionality searches the Name, Caption, and Code fields.
Cool! Use the manufacturer’s product number, SKU, or UPC code as an item’s
Code because some folks search for products by the numbers.
Product price: The price is formatted differently based upon several factors,
including the presence of a sale price or quantity pricing. If you have a regu-
lar price and a sale price, text labels appear before each number. Edit the
Regular-price-text and Sale-price-text on the Variables page.
Price-styles: This variable controls the look of prices on product and section
pages and the home page when you use specials. Figure 12-3 displays Normal
(the default), Quiet, and Big Price-styles. Keep the following in mind when
working with Price-styles:
 If Price-style is set to Quiet, prices are formatted the same as the Normal
setting with bold formatting.
 If Price-style is set to Normal, the price appears without bold. If there’s a
Sale-price, the Sale-price is displayed in bold as well, and the color of the
Sale-price comes from the variable Emphasis-color.
 If you have Price-style set to Big, the sale price appears bigger in Display-
text-title, which matches the headline font, but the color is controlled by
Emphasis-color.
188
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Product options: Product options (like color or size) appear as drop-down
menus. The variable Order-style determines how options are formatted:
 Normal lets the options fall where they may, depending on length of 
the text.
 Two-line inserts a line break after the name, which kicks the code and all
the options down to the next line.
 Multi-line kicks each option down to a separate line, which looks a lot
better for stores that offer a lot of product options, such as apparel
retailers.
Figure 12-4 shows how Quantity pricing displays a little differently. For exam-
ple, if the regular price is $12, your Sale-price is $10, and you have a buy-12-or-
more price of $5, the Store Editor displays your price like this:
Regular Price: $12.00
Sale Price $10.00, 12/$60.00
Figure 12-4:

189
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

The text in the Quantity-text variable separates the quantity and the price
when you discount an item with quantity pricing. I think 12 for $60.00 reads
better than 12/$60.00. Change the / (slash) to the word for, and your price
looks like this:
Regular Price: $12.00
Sale Price $10.00, 12 for $60.00
Order button: The text on the Order button comes from the text in the vari-
able Order-text. Make that text Add To Cart or Add To My Cart for a higher-
converting product page.
After all the order and price stuff, any IDs inside the Contents field display
according to how you have your Leaf settings on the Config page, with
thumbnails, links, text, price, and sometimes an Order button.
Maintaining Your Pages 
in the Store Editor
In this section, I cover the basics of creating and maintaining a new store in
the Store Editor, including new ways to create pages, effective editing, how to
move pages, and painless page removal with a primer in deleting pages. If
your inventory changes pretty often or you have new products coming in,
you’ll spend a lot of time creating and editing pages. More time on the site
means more money in the bank!
Creating new pages inside the Store Editor
Creating a new page in the Store Editor is easy. All you do is click the appro-
priate button, type the page’s name, and click the Update button:
 To create a section page, click the Section button. The Store Editor cre-
ates a new section and takes you to that new section’s Edit page, where
you can type info or upload images.
 As shown in Figure 12-5, an Edit page is simply a Web form with all the
different fields for an item or section. Type some text in the Name field,
type a brief description in the Caption field, and click the Update button.
Your changes appear on the page. If you’re happy with your work, keep
on trucking. If not, simply click the Edit button, which takes you back to
the Edit page, and make any desired changes. Pages created with the
Section button are not leafed, and the Orderable, Taxable, and Leaf fields
are automatically set to No.
190
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 To create an item page, click the Item button. A new page is created
inside the page you were just on. The Store Editor is pretty smart and
anticipates that this new item page is going to be a product. The Edit
page, where you can input the Name, Code, and Price fields, appears for
this item. The Orderable, Taxable, and Leaf fields are automatically set
to Yes. Pages created with the Item button are also leafed so that when
you add accessories to an item page, they’ll have an Order button.
 To create an Accessory, you need to be on an item. If you are on an Item
page, the Item button on the Edit Nav-bar is replaced by the Accessory
button. Click the Accessory button to add a product to the Item page.
Accessory items are NIL templates, which means that they don’t have
their own page, but exist only on this item page.
Store Editor pages can change back and forth from section to item to acces-
sory and back. All you have to do is change a few settings on the Edit page
and add (or remove) some missing information. The Show Product/Hide
Product button makes the hidden product fields appear or disappear. These
product fields are Code, Price, Sale-price, Orderable, Options, Ship-weight,
Taxable, Download, Family, and Gift-certificate. These fields exist on the sec-
tion pages, but you just can’t see them until you click the Product button. I
use the words item and product interchangeably because a product is some-
thing you sell, but an item can really be anything.
Here’s how to switch pages from sections to items to Accessories and back:
 To make a section an orderable item, set Orderable and Taxable to Yes,
input a Code and a Price, and change Leaf to Yes. Click the Update
button, and you now have an orderable product.
 To change an item to an Accessory, first you must be in the Advanced
mode of Store Editor. Edit an item and change the template field to NIL,
which makes it a NULL page.
 To make an Accessory into an item (with its own page), you must be in
the Advanced Store Editor. Edit the item and change the Template field
from NIL to “Page.” (without the quotes but with the period) and click
the Update button.

Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

Advanced users can create new pages in other places, too: on the Contents
page and by performing database uploads. These other ways of adding pages
give you more control over the pages and allow you to do things you just
can’t do by clicking the Item, Section, or Accessory buttons. Here’s how I like
to add pages to my sites:
 Create items or sections on the Contents page. Click the Contents
button on the Edit Nav-bar, which takes you to the Contents (site map)
page. Figure 12-6 displays what you see when you click the New button.
Type the ID and select a type to create a new page. Creating products in
Store Editor from the Contents page gives you total control of the ID, but
the page isn’t inside a section page anywhere and is considered an
orphaned item. The page has the same settings as an item page (the
Orderable, Taxable, and Leaf fields are automatically set to Yes).
 Add thousands of products and sections with the click of a mouse.
Click the Database Upload button on the Edit Nav-bar, upload a CSV with
your new or updated product information, and click either the Add or
Rebuild button to update your store. Be careful. Creating products with
a database upload lets you control the ID, determine the Path (where
pages exist in your store’s navigational hierarchy), and control the con-
tents inside each page, among other things. Read the full details in
Chapter 23 before you start shaving with a chain saw.
When you create multiple items that are almost the same, it would be nice if
you could use a Clone button to create a new item with copies of all the same
settings. Unfortunately, this Clone button doesn’t exist for the Store Editor.
The best way to create many similar, yet slightly different, products or pages
is to use the Database Upload feature. Create a CSV file using Microsoft Excel,
create a record with the original info, and then copy the record, changing the
ID field for each variation of the product you have. Save the CSV and do a
database upload. I cover product uploads in loving detail in Chapter 23.

Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Editing product and section pages
Editing product and section pages is easy with the Store Editor. To edit a page,
browse to that page in the Editor and click the Edit button. Add or edit text,
upload images, or change prices. Click the Update button to save your
changes and then preview that page in the Store Editor. If you like what you
see, click the Publish button to make your edits to the live site. In a few
moments, the real version of the store is updated with your changes. You
don’t have to publish after every page you change, but I do like to publish
every hour or so as I’m working in the store to keep the published store
updated.
When you click the Edit button, the Edit page for that object appears, and
you can see the properties of the specific page in an HTML Web form that lets
you add, edit, or delete information in various fields (Name, Image, Code,
Price, or Caption). After you make your changes, you can accept your edits
by clicking the Update button or opt not to save them by clicking the Cancel
button.
When you click the Edit button on a page, you’re only editing that one page.
When you click the Variables button and change settings, you’re making
changes to the global Variables settings that affect virtually every page on
your store. There is only one Variables button, not a Variables button for
each page. This point confuses some folks.
Also, when you click the Edit All button on a section page, you can edit the
Name, Code, Price, Sale-price, and Options for all the items in that section in
one spot.
Moving pages by cutting to the Clipboard
The Clipboard and Cut function make it easy to move pages around in the
Store Editor. Here’s how it works: Browse to the page you want to move and
click the Cut button on the Edit Nav-bar to cut the page from whatever page
it was inside (removing the ID from the Contents field) and place it on the
Clipboard. The page appears just under the Edit Nav-bar as the name of the
product as a text link. Just browse to the wherever you want to move the
page and click the name of the page on the Clipboard to insert the cut page
as the last object on that page.
193
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

Using the Cut function removes the page from every other section or product
page it appears in. This deletion may be a problem if the page appears inside
many products and sections. Okay! Here’s some Clipboard content for your
consideration:
 Editing pages on the Clipboard is tricky. One way to edit them is to
temporarily paste the page on another page, edit that page, and then cut
it to the Clipboard again after editing it. A better way to edit pages cut to
the Clipboard is to use the Find button. Type the page’s ID to jump
straight to the page and click the Edit button to go to town.
 Cutting a page to the Clipboard makes the cut page an exiled item so
that it doesn’t appear on the published site. These pages look okay in
the Editor but are invisible on the published site as long as the page is
marked by a button at the top of the Unexile page.
 You can place exiled pages into section pages by typing or pasting the
ID into the Contents field, but the pages are still exiled. Exiled pages
may work in the Editor and look like good links, but the links aren’t click-
able on the published site, and visitors trying to get to the page from
search engines or by typing the URL straight in their browser either get
an error page or are dumped to your home page.
 If a page was on the Clipboard and then got knocked off (for whatever
reason), it may still be marked exiled. Exiled pages are bad news
because the pages don’t work on the published version of the site, but
they look okay in the Store Editor. You don’t really know you have a
problem until you publish and poke around on the published version of
the site. When customers complain about links not working or pages dis-
appearing, it’s usually a case of an exiled page.
 The only way to fix an exiled page is to click the Unexile button.
Unexiling a page and clicking the Publish button makes the page avail-
able on the published site.
 To see all the exiled pages in your store, go to the Contents (site map)
page and click the Siberia button. A page appears displaying all the IDs
of the exiled pages, whether or not they appear on the Clipboard.
When you do a database upload (see Chapter 23), pages on the Clipboard get
dumped back into the site because, for some bizarre reason, all exiled items
get unexiled. These dumped items from the Clipboard become orphaned pages
(pages without parent pages linking to them), and you can find them at the
bottom of the Contents page (site map). These pages appear in your internal
store site search results. Search engines can find them, which means that cus-
tomers can find them and order items you thought you took off the site.
194
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Copying pages into more than one section
Sometimes you want a product to appear in more than one section. For 
example, say that you sell a hundred different flashlights, and they all use the
same size batteries. Instead of making 100 different accessories with the
exact same information, just copy the batteries onto every flashlight page.
A faster way to put the same product into multiple section pages is to insert
the ID of the page into the Contents field of every page where you want that
page/object to appear. Browse to the section page, click the Edit button, type
the ID, and click the Update button. Repeat for each additional section page.
Deleting pages
Deleting pages can be scary! When you delete a page, you delete all the pages
inside that page, and the pages inside that page, and so on, and so on, and so
on, as well as every single reference to all those deleted IDs in any other page
on your site. When you click the Delete button on a section or item page, you
get a list of all the IDs you’re about to delete accompanied by a very scary
warning message:
“Warning: You are about to delete: {name of ID}. Deleting will remove all
instances of the above-listed item(s) and or section(s) throughout your store -
not just the items on this page. Deletions are not recoverable. Are you sure
you want to delete?”
This message is your only chance to reconsider. Carefully read through the
list of IDs and click the Yes button if you’re certain you never want to see
those pages again. After you click the Yes button, your deleted page(s) are
gone forever. This point is super-important: All the pages inside that page
(pages with IDs in the Contents field) get deleted, too, even if the pages exist
elsewhere. So if you delete a section containing section pages with tons of
subsections with potentially hundreds of products, who knows how many
pages you’re deleting. Talk about collateral damage!
To remove IDs from any particular page without deleting anything, simply
edit the section page, scroll down to the Contents field, highlight the object
ID with your mouse, and press the spacebar. If the page is the child of many
other pages, you aren’t really orphaning that product. If the object doesn’t
exist inside any other pages, it will be orphaned, and you can find it on the
Contents page or by using the Find button.
195
Chapter 12: Creating Product Pages with the Store Editor

When I delete pages, I usually create a new temporary page with the ID
delete-me-please. Then I paste all the IDs of all the pages I want to delete in
the Contents field of the new delete-me-please page and click the Update
button. If I’m really sure, I click the Delete button on the Edit Nav-bar and
then click the Yes button, and all those pages are gone forever.

Merchandising to Sell More
In This Chapter
 Picking the products you prefer to push
 Merchandising products across the entire site
 Cross-selling in the cart
 Navigating the virtual aisles
M
erchandising your online store is one of the keys to online retail suc-
cess. How you display your products on your Web site determines
which products get exposure. The products that people see are the products
that get sold.
Remember that the average visitor to your Web site will only see four or five
pages. You have a lot of control over which pages the average customer sees
by which products you feature on your home page and how you design your
store’s navigation. (For more on home-page design, see Chapter 11.)
In this chapter, I show you how to pick which products you should push, how
to organize your section and category navigation to get the most bang for
your buck, and how to maximize your most valuable real estate.
Specializing in Bestsellers
I could make this chapter extremely short if my editor, Kelly, would let me get
away with it. Here goes: 99 percent of Yahoo! Store merchandising is taking
your bestselling products and slapping them up on your front page where
everyone can see ’em. That’s it. Trust me. It’s better than free money.
Half of the people who hit your site visit your home page. Put your specials
near the top of your home page (within the first screen shot), and maybe
you’ll see 150 percent increases in sales per product like I do. You can cross-
sell from the Shopping Cart all you want, but 90 percent of the people who
visit your site will never add an item to their cart. Cross-link, accessorize,
upsell, and add on like crazy, but effective home-page specials kick your “You
want fries with that?” up and down the block.

Featuring specials
The Store Editor gives you an easy way to feature items, sections, or other
pages on your home page with the Specials feature. Specials are thumbnail
images and text that link to a featured product or section. Figure 13-1 shows
you an example of a home page that makes good use of specials.
Keep your site looking fresh by rotating new items and bestsellers as home-
page specials. Show as many specials as you want on your home page, but I
think anything more than two rows is wasted space. I prefer five-column rows
showing the thumbnail, a text link, and the price.
Figure 13-1:

Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 
It’s the little things that getcha!
Uh-oh! I may have just done you wrong in trying
to drive home a very important point. The reality
is that most small-business retailers don’t max-
imize the effectiveness of their home page spe-
cials, but that’s where most people get the
biggest bang for their buck. If I can’t get retail-
ers to do the big, easy things, how can I ever get
them to accessorize, cross-link, upsell, and add
on to every single customer?
As a retailer and a consultant, I tend to try to be
a home-run hitter. I like to swing for the fences
and knock it out of the park. I like to run the
bases and do the little dance. Home runs are
fun, but the reality is that bunts and singles and
sacrifice flies win baseball games. I recommend
that you do both. When you have a new break-
out product that looks like it could be a home
run, then swing for the fence. But with your
average, ordinary, everyday sale, just try to get
the guy to buy some batteries, too. Think of it as
a sacrifice fly to bring in that guy on third base.
No matter what you do, brilliant merchandising
is not going to double or triple the sales of the
majority of your products.

Making something special
To make an item a special, browse to that item in the Store Editor and click
the Special button, located in the middle of the Edit Nav-bar. The Editor 
creates a special link to that item on the home page and takes you there to
see it.
To remove a special, you need to browse to the item or section page that is
the special, and the fastest way to do that from the home page is to click the
special’s thumbnail. When the product page loads, look at the Edit Nav-bar.
Notice that the Special button now says Not Special, which reminds you that
this page is a featured item on the home page. To remove this item from the
specials, click the Not Special button, which removes the link from the home
page. The Editor whisks you back to the home page to show you it’s gone.
The Special/Not Special feature works in both Regular and Advanced mode. If
you see one row of buttons, you’re in the Regular mode of Store Editor. Click
the little red arrow that appears on the far right side of the Edit Nav-bar to
switch to the Advanced mode. When you see two rows of buttons on the Edit
Nav-bar, you’re in the Advanced mode of Store Editor, which gives you access
to all kinds of powerful store-building and -editing features. Click the button
on the far left side of the Edit Nav-bar to return to Regular mode.
There’s a quicker and better way to add or edit specials when you’re in
Advanced mode. Browse to the home page and click the Edit button to edit
the home page. When you have specials on your home page, the object-IDs of
the products or sections appear in the Specials field in the order that they
appear on the page. This field acts just like another Contents field, where you
control the specials by adding, shuffling, or removing object-IDs from the
Specials field.
199
Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More
Victoria’s other secret
If you don’t believe me, I’ll let you in on Victoria’s
Other Secret. There I was in sunny California at
Search Engine Strategies, and I happened to be
eating lunch with the former marketing some-
thing-something of Victoria’s Secret. Guess who
got to go to merchandising school and find out
about maximizing the most valuable real estate
on your home page by rotating and testing prod-
uct specials?
Now I don’t kiss and tell, but I discovered that
some companies live and die by home-page
specials. Some companies like to put three spe-
cials on the home page because that real estate
is more valuable than any runway model. Within
an hour, one special gets pulled because it’s not,
uh, fully supporting someone’s well-developed
marketing goals. I guess even supermodels live
and die by that conversion rate. Work it, baby!

Here’s how to manage specials a little bit faster by editing the home page:
 Make an item a special. Type the object-ID of any product or section in
the Specials field and click the Update button.
 Remove a special from the home page. Delete the object-ID from the
Specials field and click the Update button.
 Change the order of the specials on the home page. Change the order
of the object-IDs inside the Specials field and click the Update button.
Editing the look and feel of specials
To change the appearance of home-page specials, click the Edit button on 
the home page. When the Edit page appears, scroll down until you see the
Specials-format setting, which controls the two different ways specials appear:
As-thumbnails or As-contents. Figure 13-1 shows a page with the Specials-
format set to As-thumbnails, which is the default setting and renders specials
links as images with a thumbnail and label. As-contents displays specials just
like the Contents look on your home page.
Showing specials As-thumbnails is really good for new stores that haven’t fig-
ured out how to maximize the use of the Contents formatting settings, which
are kind of convoluted.
These different elements control the appearance of specials:
 Thumbnail: The thumbnail image is automatically generated from the
item’s Image field unless you uploaded a separate image to the Icon field.
The thumbnail image’s size is controlled on the Variables page by Thumb-
height and Thumb-width settings, which are set to 45 pixels by default.
 Label text: The label text (which really isn’t text, but a GIF file image of
text) comes from an item’s Label field, unless it’s empty and uses the
item’s Name field instead.
 Label settings: The appearance of the label text is controlled by three
settings on the Variables page: Label-font, Label-font-size, and Label-
color. The default settings are Helvetica-Bold, 10, Black (0 0 0), which
makes the label text read okay, but the letters are always all caps, which
is harder to read.
Match your Label-font to the other fonts you use on the site, but don’t
make your Label-font-size too big. I see a lot of new Yahoo! Stores with
huge labels! Keep your Label-font-size smaller than your Button-font-size
or Display-font-size.
 Price: The price comes from the real selling price, whether that’s the
Price or the Sale-price (if there is one). If the Variables setting Price-style
200
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

is set to Quiet, then price shows only on the item page, not the section
or the home page. The color of the price is controlled by the Variables
setting Emphasis-color.
Specials As-thumbnails show up only in one row, so the number of specials
you can have is limited to the page width. Also, unlike specials As-contents,
the Name field doesn’t automatically kick down to the next line. If the name of
a product is too long, it looks funky! Fortunately, the Label field comes to the
rescue. You can either type a short, snappy label or, because the Label field is
a “smart” field that remembers line breaks, type a few words, press Enter,
type a few more words, press Enter, and type the rest of your label on the
third line.
Specials shown As-thumbnails are images (even the text is a picture of text),
not a graphic, so you don’t get the benefit of anchor text for search engine
optimization. I cover SEO in Chapter 19.
Figure 13-2 shows Specials As-contents, which look just like your Contents.
The Contents of the home page are your top-level categories, which are deter-
mined by which Object-IDs are inside the Contents field of the home page.
When you use the Specials:As-contents setting, the look of both your Contents
and specials is controlled by the home page settings Contents-elements,
Contents-format, and Columns. On almost any other page, the look of
Contents is controlled by the Variables with the same names.
Figure 13-3 shows the Edit page of your home page, which has separate
Contents-elements, Contents-format, and Columns settings than the rest of
your site, so you can go for a slightly different look here. I talk about formatting
your section pages with these variables and the Leaf setting in Chapter 11.

Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More

Troubleshooting specials
Don’t panic if specials don’t show up on your home page when you think they
should. Specials are turned on by default, but you (or your designer) may
have changed your Page-elements settings. To make sure that the specials
element is turned on in your home page’s Page-elements setting, browse to
the home page, click the Edit button, and take a look. A list of all the elements
shows up in the order that they appear.
For example, I’m showing all my Page-elements on http://Ystorebooks.com:
Name, Specials, Image, Message, Contents, Address, Intro-text, Final-text,
Buttons, and Search. Click the Change button, and the Edit List Position (Page-
elements) form pops up, where you can change the numbers to the right of
the elements’ names to alter the order the elements appear on the home page.
If you don’t want certain elements to appear, remove the number from the
Order field. I talk a lot more about Page-elements and other settings unique to
the home page and other pages in Chapter 11.
Make sure there’s at least one real Object-ID in the Specials field, too. It’s easy
to make a typo if you’re just typing in the object-IDs. If you’re using Specials-
format:As-contents, make sure that some elements (Image, Screen-title-text,
Price, and so on) are selected in Contents-elements. Also, take a look at your
Variables page and make sure that Label-color and Link-color aren’t the same
color as your background.

Picking What Products to Push
Knowing how to promote products and merchandise your Yahoo! Store is
important, but knowing which products to promote can be the difference
between making it and not making it. When selecting products to feature or
to make a special on the home page, I look at overall sales volume, how much
profit I make per sale, and which products generate repeat business and
appeal to customers who are more likely to buy again and again.
Use the Store Manager’s Sales report to determine your products for mer-
chandising. I take my bestselling products and look at several different fac-
tors: revenue (sales), page views (popularity), number of orders, and number
of items sold. Product sales history is more about merchandising than it is
about statistics. In Chapter 20, I show you how to use your Sales report to
find which products to push and which sections and categories deserve the
largest portion of navigational real estate based upon what’s really selling.
Here’s how I decide what products to promote:
 Most of the time, a little sells a lot. For most retailers, 20 percent of
their products drive 80 percent of their sales. Looking at a real Yahoo!
Store’s sales for April 2005, 700 different products sold that month:
• The top ten products accounted for 35 percent of the revenue.
• The top 40 products accounted for 60 percent of the revenue.
• The top 120 products accounted for 80 percent of the revenue.
Make more by prominently displaying these top items. Highlight or fea-
ture these bestsellers within their various categories to maximize sales.
 Nothing succeeds like success. Pushing what items are already selling
can give you a lot more sales with just a little more effort. It’s far easier
to take a solid seller and turn it into a star than it is to get a slow-moving
item moving at all. Push the fact that your bestsellers are the best-
sellers. Most people feel more comfortable buying what other people
bought. If it’s popular, it may not be the best, but it’s probably not the
worst! I can increase a bestseller’s sales by 10 to 15 percent just by
adding “bestseller” to the name. Sounds sort of obvious, but it works!
 Promote products that encourage repeat orders. I also like to push the
pages that sell products to folks who tend to become repeat customers.
I am much more interested in getting a customer for life than I am in
simply making a single sale. I push anything that needs refills, or wears
203
Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More

out, or gets used up, or gets read or watched and has new releases
coming out.
 It’s not what you gross, it’s what you net. If my dad said that once, he
said it a thousand times. It’s taken me awhile, but I finally get it. I pro-
mote the stuffing out of products where I have a higher profit margin. All
things being equal, if a customer is trying to decide between two prod-
ucts that cost about the same and solve the same problem, I’m going to
push the product (or the distributor or manufacturer) that gives me the
better discount and the fattest margin. Sometimes that extra 5 or 10 per-
cent profit is the difference between making it and not making it.
Making small improvements to your top-selling product pages can result in
huge increases in sales, but the opposite is also true. You can screw up a per-
fectly good product page by trying to “fix” it. Be careful. Make small changes
and track your results. If something doesn’t work — or shoots your sales in
the foot — it’s easy to undo that last change and try something else.
Merchandising Top Sellers 
with Navigation
Generally, a typical Yahoo! Store’s top-level navigation is divided evenly
between the seven or eight major categories reflecting the breadth of the
store’s product mix. My experience is that more than half of a store’s sales
comes from its top two or three product categories. What’s funny is that the
subsections of these super-categories often outsell the nonperforming top-
level categories, even though the nonperformers get all that valuable naviga-
tion button bar real estate. Pretend you’re looking at licensing revenues for
all the starters on a pro sports team —say, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen,
some guy who looks kinda familiar, some other guy, and that guy no one ever
remembers. I bet Michael Jordan’s Pez dispenser revenues alone outsell the
rest of the team’s total licensing revenues combined.
Your business probably isn’t exactly what you envisioned when you started
it, but hey, you’re selling something. Here’s an idea: Let your customers tell
you what’s important on your Web site by where they go and what they buy.
For example, when Steve and I started selling comics and popular culture col-
lectibles way back in 1988, we let customers’ buying habits determine how
the stores were merchandised. We actually allocated physical retail floor
space and merchandising in our stores based upon what product categories
generated the sales and profits.
204
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Do the same thing with your store’s site-wide navigation. Take your best-
selling category and pull the top three subcategories up into the top naviga-
tion. Add these subcategories to your home page, add these pages to your
navigation button bar, and give them the space they deserve.
My best experience with allocating site-wide navigational real estate by sales
volume has been to take the best “shop by manufacturer” pages and include
them in the global site navigation and top-level category pages. For example,
if you sell MP3 players, chances are that Apple’s iPod is your #1 seller.
Instead of making a customer drill down into the MP3 Players section and
then into the iPod section, move the Apple iPod section to the top of the
heap. The iPod accessories are popular, too, so that category may warrant a
top-seven spot for this hypothetical electronics retailer.
Figuring out what to feature when 
you have no track record
If you’re a new retailer, it’s hard to figure out what products to merchandise
because you have no idea what’s going to sell. You have no sales history to
fall back on, no data to mine. You can be patient and wait for six months and
let your customers tell you what to promote, but if you’re as aggressive as I
think you are, you want to take action now. Here are ways to find out what
products to promote:
 Ask your suppliers what’s hot. Your wholesalers, dealers, distributors,
and manufacturers sell the same products you buy from them to many,
many other retailers. Hopefully, your supplier won’t tell you exactly
what items your direct competition is selling, but many times you can
get companywide bestsellers, top-100 product listings, and other aggre-
gate industry information. If lots of other folks are selling it, consider
moving it to the top of your promotions list.
 Check out the competition. Lots of times, your best competitors will tip
their hands and give you valuable information about what’s selling for
them. Poke around their Web sites to see what products they promote
as popular or bestsellers.
 Go shopping at Shopping.com. Shopping.com releases a weekly list of
bestselling products. Figure 13-4 shows the Shopping.com Consumer
Demand Index, which offers lists like Top 20 Shopping Searches and
What’s Hot, as well as a graph of what’s jumping this week online. See
www.shopping.com/cdi for what’s moving and shaking in e-commerce.

 Watch the big boys, too. When Amazon.com or other category killers
are promoting specific products on their home pages or section pages,
you can be absolutely certain that this real estate is generating revenue,
whether through direct online sales or kickbacks for product placement
by the manufacturer. Hide and watch!
 Pay to play. Buy yourself some test traffic. Spend the big bucks on a Pay-
Per-Click advertising blitz (which I talk about in Chapter 18) and watch
where all the traffic goes.
Featuring products across the site
You have many opportunities across your store to feature products. You can
promote new items, special offers, and featured products on the home page.
On section pages, you can add links to recommended products inside the
caption, as well as feature bestsellers. On product pages, you can feature sim-
ilar and even competing products with Compare To links. You can also upsell
by linking to higher end, best-in-class products. You can also display sup-
plies, accessories, and related items on every product page. When someone
adds something to the Shopping Cart, you can use the cross-sell feature to
show three related products or accessories.

206
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Here’s how I recommend featuring products across your site:
 Maximize your home-page real estate. Make one row of five specials
across the top of your home page. Rotate these on a weekly basis. Include
a loss leader, a new product, and three of your bestsellers from different
sections. Do anything you can to make the offer more exciting. If you can,
do a limited-time offer. Push new products in their own section.
 Push bestselling products on section pages. Sprinkle hypertext links to
specific products within the captions of other products. For example, on
Mom’s duck calls section page, I link to a related waterfowl identification
book. This link is not only helpful to customers, but it’s also very good
for search engine optimization as well.
Figure 13-5 shows how I push to the top three products that I would
really prefer to sell. I have a higher profit margin on these products, the
product pages convert extremely well, or these products are my best-
selling products in this section. Emphasizing your bestsellers on your
section pages helps customers like me who may not want to evaluate
every possible product you sell, but just want to find something that’ll
do the job and buy it.
Also, often times the last icon on the right of the first row gets all the
clicks. Put your bestselling or most profitable product here. Whatever
link gets the clicks gets the chance to convert a browser into a buyer.

Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More
Speeding up the clock with paid search
Several years ago, I spent around $2,000 buying
paid-search keywords and sold around $5,000
worth of hammocks in an affiliate pilot project.
In the end, I lost only a little bit of money after
paying for the hammocks ($3,500 wholesale
cost) and some overhead (around $500), but I
discovered which pages and products generated
sales a lot faster than I would have otherwise.
Paid-search advertising allowed us to buy the
most valuable keywords and turn several thou-
sand shoppers loose in our store. We saw
where they went and what they bought. We
found out that our most popular products were
buried way too deep in the Web site.
This research convinced us to move these prod-
ucts to the top of the home page and feature
them as home-page specials. We also discov-
ered that even though our site was organized
into seven major sections, the majority of our
sales came from two sections and all their sub-
sections. The first thing I did after that campaign
was to upgrade the subsections from those 
two super-selling sections to top-level section
navigation.

 Upsell on the product pages. Product pages are the perfect place to
upsell better merchandise. Make sure that your customers explore all
their options before deciding what to buy. As a shopper, I hate nothing
more than buying the wrong version of what I really need. You’re actu-
ally doing me a favor by trying to sell me the best product for my needs.
A real-world example of upselling is when retail salespeople start show-
ing you the top-of-the-line models and then work their way down the
product line until they find a product that has both the features you
need and a price you can afford. Unfortunately, you can’t control what
products customers look at first, but you can gently push people to the
products you think they should consider.
On mid-line or bargain-level products, link to more expensive products
with text like “Need more features? Consider the S-class Widget 600.”
Link to best-in-class or feature-rich, top-of-the-line products.
 Accessorize the product pages. Product pages are the perfect place 
to sell shoppers everything they possibly need to get the most out of
their merchandise. If a product needs batteries, sell batteries on the
product page. Push extended warranties, refills, and any accessories
that make sense.
If a particular product has multiple accessories, take three to five 
accessories and bundle them with the original product to make a kit, gift
basket, or ultimate version of the product. Throw in a little something
extra for free for a very inexpensive promotion and an easy upsell.

Finding $30,000 in Sales 
by Using Cross-Sell
Cross-sell is a relatively new feature for Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, which is
available for all accounts except those using the Starter package. The Cross-
sell feature uses item codes to connect items placed in the cart with corre-
sponding cross-sell items. Not only can you use cross-sell to suggest other
related items when someone adds a specific product to her cart, but when
someone buys one item, you can also give her a discount (as a percentage or
a dollar amount off) on other specific items. You can also set start and end
dates for promotions and special offers.
I used to believe that the Cross-sell feature was more clutter than it was worth
because when a shopper gets something into the cart, I like to get out of her way
and let her check out. When someone is in the mood to buy, I try to do two
things: make sure that she has everything she needs and then get out of her way.
I am obsessed with removing clutter from the shopping process. Remove all
impediments to buying. Anything that gets in the way of closing the sale is gone.
I’ll admit it. I was wrong! Here’s a cool story that illustrates the point that you
don’t need to close the sale until you make sure that the customer has every-
thing he needs.
Figure 13-6 shows how a new client’s site generates around $100 a day in
additional sales from cross-sells. That’s $36,000 a year. You can also see what
products are being cross-sold because items bought from cross-selling have
little + signs next to them on the individual Order page.
Figure 13-6:
Sales from
cross-
selling show
up on the
graph.
209
Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More

The best part about cross-selling products is that these sales are most likely
ones you wouldn’t have gotten otherwise, so all the gross profit really goes to
the bottom line. Usually, there’s no additional cost on the sales, because you
can just throw something extra in the box. Sweet!
As long as you know a little bit about cross-selling, you’re ready to try it out.
Go to the Store Manager under Promote and click the Cross-Sell link. If you
haven’t already turned on Cross-Sells, click the Get Started Now link. Figure
13-7 shows you the page where you can either create your cross-sell items by
hand, or you can create a table or CSV file with a list of product codes and
the corresponding codes of items you want to cross-sell with those products.
Retailers with large stores will probably never get around to listing three to
five items for every item in their store. I recommend starting with the top
100, and doing ten products a day until you start seeing some results. When I
don’t have a specific cross-sell item for a product, I like to have what I call a
global cross-sell item. A global cross-sell works great until you take the time
to hand-pick three or more cross-sell items for every single product in your
Yahoo! Store.
Stop and look at each product and figure out three to five things that 
someone buying this product also needs. Take a look at the orders for this
Figure 13-7:
Create
cross-sell
items in 
the Store
Manager
under
Cross-Sell.
210
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

product. Look at the other products people bought when they purchased 
this product. Consider those products as well when you create your cross-
sell database. The more time and thought you put into a product’s cross-sell
items, the better your cross-sells will do for you.
Here’s something easy to do that starts getting results immediately: Pick a
popular product that appeals to the broadest range of customers and offer it
as a default cross-sell on every product.
Do these two things: (a) Change the Code on that product to Cart-Special and
(b) create and upload a cross-sell table with a row for each product with each
product’s code in the purchase-item-code field and the code Cart-Special in
the every cross-sell-item-code field.
Here’s the cool part: Anytime you want, you can change what product is the
cart-special by changing which product has the code Cart-Special. This rocks!
Before you can create a Cross-Sell table to upload, you need a list of all your
product codes. You can get this list of codes by exporting your products
under Catalog Manager, under the product summary of the Controls in the
Store Editor, from the XML feed, or by using a third-party export tool like
David Burke’s Ystore Export tool at http://ydev.visualfuture.com (see
Chapter 23).
Cross-sells let you give free gifts with the purchase of selected items! I got a
20 percent increase in conversion rate by offering a free gift with a purchase
on one of our Yahoo! Stores. These free gifts cost us about a dollar, but the
perceived value to our customers is much, much higher. Our inventory of
free gifts changes quite frequently, and I can tell when we have a lame free gift
because sales tend to drop!
Make the discount on a cross-sell item 100 percent, which makes that item
free. Pretty cool! People can drive you crazy with free gifts, though, so be
careful. Some folks try to get something for nothing and will do things like try
to edit the quantity on their free gift. Make sure that you include proper dis-
claimers and terms and conditions on your free gifts just in case.
Merchandising Products in Other Ways
After you’ve figured out your most profitable categories and which items to
cross-sell, look at other ways to shop. You never stop coming up with new
ways to organize your products. See how your customers shop your store to
211
Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More

determine how you merchandise your Yahoo! Store. Perhaps they do one (or
more) of the following:
 Shop by product type: I prefer to group my merchandise in categories
by product type. It’s pretty easy to figure out category names, too.
Category names should be the generic keywords that most shoppers use
when searching for what you sell. By researching basic keywords (which
I talk about in Chapter 16), brainstorming, looking at the competition,
and asking some real customers how they shop, you can figure out
exactly what your main category navigation should be.
 Shop by manufacturer or brand name: I also like to group products by
manufacturer or brand name. Brand-name pages are also keyword
loaded. Sometimes your manufacturer pages will be your most popular
pages. Brand names are a very safe way for consumers to shop. For
example, I don’t know a lot about patio doors and windows, but if I buy a
top brand like Pella, I think I should be okay.
 Shop by problem (or solution): Lots of customers search for solutions
to their problems rather than by the specific name of a product or prod-
uct type. For example, if you sell dental hygiene supplies, create a Shop
By page called Ten Best Products To Cure Bad Breath, where you put the
alcohol-free mouthwash, the tongue scrapers, the dental floss, and
related products. I generated a lot of free search-engine traffic to one of
my dog sites when I created content pages about solving dog-training
problems: how to stop dogs from unwanted digging, how to stop dogs
from chewing, how to crate-train dogs (potty training), and how to stop
dogs from barking. Most of this content was free training information,
but I also linked to various products from these pages.
 Shop by customer type: You can classify your customers into several
different categories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced users; ama-
teurs, semi-pros, or professionals; personal, small business, or corporate/
government customers; and so on.
 Shop by name (author, artist, and musician): When I sell books, I also
like to create a Shop By Author or Shop By Artist category, where I can
feature all the creator’s work and include a short biography. These
author pages are also great for linking to other resource pages.
 Shop by bestselling products: You can feature your top ten bestselling
products across the whole store, as well as bestsellers by section and by
product type. For example, on a strollers section page, you could high-
light your top three bestselling baby jogging strollers.
212
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Shop new arrivals: Create a new arrivals section, where you can feature
the latest products to arrive in your online store. Feature this section on
the home page, too.
 Shop by occasion: Make special sections for each gift-giving holiday that
applies to your business — Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, birthdays,
Valentine’s Day, and especially Christmas.
 Shop by price: Price is a great way to merchandise products, especially
higher-end retail. Lots of people have a dollar amount in mind when
they’re shopping and either can’t or won’t spend any more or less.
For example, a few years back, I was looking to buy a bass amplifier, and
I made up my mind that it was going to cost around $1,000 to get what I
needed. The sales guy kept showing me $400 and $500 amps. They were
nice, but didn’t have enough thump. Argh! I kept saying, “I want some-
thing bigger. I want something louder. I have to compete with the world’s
loudest drummer.” Finally he got it, and I got the amp I wanted. Mo’ bass!
213
Chapter 13: Merchandising to Sell More
Would you like fries with that?
Retailing super-consultant Harry Friedman likes
to tell this story at his retailing seminars. Harry
tests his client stores to see how many times
their salespeople will add on to an existing sale
after someone has decided to buy something.
He sends mystery shoppers into his clients’
retail stores with a no-limit American Express
card, with instructions to say yes every single
time the salesperson adds on items to an exist-
ing sale. For example, someone selling a suit
may suggest a belt, or socks, or a tie, or a sport
coat, and the mystery shopper says yes every
time. It’s pretty funny (but probably not to the
retailer) to see how few add-ons salespeople
will attempt before they decide that you’ve
bought enough and decide to cut you off.
Recently, I had a chance to try out this approach
when I bought an Oreck vacuum cleaner. 
I wanted to see how many times the phone rep
would add on. First, I bought the vacuum cleaner.
Next I bought a year’s worth of bags. Then I
bought a multipurpose pocketknife. Next I bought
an air filter, and at that point, I was getting a little
nervous. I bought another multipurpose pocket-
knife, but then he stopped. Whew! I’m glad I did
my add-on experiment, but if anyone wants a
deal on some pocketknives, give me a holler. . . .

Checking Out the New 
Shopping Cart
In This Chapter
 Exploring the new Checkout Manager’s many features
 Designing your cart to match the look and feel of your store
 Selling more by streamlining checkout pages
A
well-designed Shopping Cart and secure checkout are extremely crucial
elements of any successful e-commerce business. Your checkout needs
to be easy to use as well as inspire trust and confidence in your company as
shoppers consider giving you their money and personal information.
In the past, Yahoo!’s checkout lacked customization options and was one of
the biggest liabilities of the Yahoo! Store platform. I have never liked the
checkout, but I just got over it instead of worrying about something I couldn’t
change. Well, suffer no more, Y!folks. Not only are the new Shopping Cart and
Checkout Manager real, they’re spectacular!
The new Checkout Manager is extremely well organized and well thought-out.
You now have control over the cart’s and checkout’s flow, appearance, navi-
gation, branding, fields, checkout buttons, and functionality.
In this chapter, I discuss all the cool, new changes in the brand-new Checkout
Manager. I really love the new cart and Checkout Manager. They’re screaming!
When this cart becomes the real checkout procedure (probably by the time
you read this book), it’s gonna rock! Bear in mind that the new Checkout
Manager was in beta at the time of this writing. By the time this book is pub-
lished, there may very well be some feature changes, so check out the Yahoo!
Help files for the most current info.

Introducing the New Checkout Manager
I’m happy to introduce the new V3 (Version 3) checkout. The more I dig into
it, the more impressed I am with all those smart folks in Sunnyvale in the
Store division at Yahoo! Retailers have been waiting for these changes for a
long, long time, but it looks like it was worth it! The checkout is a control
freak’s dream! Now you can customize everything.
Eventually, the new Checkout Manager will become the default checkout for
new Merchant Solutions accounts, so a lot of the things mentioned in this
chapter won’t show up on the Store Manager for new accounts.
Whew! The new Checkout Manager has more than 100 pages of documenta-
tion in the Yahoo! Store Help files, so this chapter is really more of an overview
of what you can do than how to do everything you can possibly do. For all 
the details, download Yahoo!’s excellent “Getting Started Guide for Checkout
Manager” at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/manage/checkout
and read over the Help files there, too.
To start playing around with the new cart, you must turn on the Beta test by
clicking the Store Manager link to the Checkout Manager (Beta) and accept
the Beta agreement. Click the Test Your Checkout Manager Settings link,
which takes you to a page where you can set the test cookie on your machine
so that you can place test orders in the New Checkout without mucking
about with your real store.
Exploring the Checkout Manager
The new Checkout Manager is accessible from a link in the Store Manager under
Order Settings. Checkout Manager is divided into four separate modules:
 Global Settings, which controls checkout flow and the checkout wrap-
per (HTML for navigation and branding) and is covered in the section
“Controlling Checkout Flow with Global Settings,” later in this chapter.
 Page Configuration, which defines page titles, whether top and/or side
navigation appears, and head tags and gives you total control of stan-
dard and custom fields and their labels, and is covered in the section
“Configuring Elements with Page Configuration,” later in this chapter.
 Visual Customization, which determines the look and feel through
Global styles (either default Visual Styles, a custom-configured Visual
Style, or totally customized CSS);  with Font, Text Links, Sections and
Sub-Sections, and Checkout Buttons; Progress Indicator, and Checkout
Buttons with Button Labels (text); and Button Style (CSS Button, HTML
216
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Button, Text Link, or Image Button). See the section “Customizing Your
Visual Design,” later in this chapter, for more info.
 Advanced Settings, which controls Order Button Behavior, Special
Handling (Downloadable Goods, Gift Certificates, and No Cost Goods),
Item Option Validation, and the Revert panel, where you can revert back
to the published settings or the default settings for the Checkout
Manager. For more info, read the section “Tinkering with Advanced
Settings,” later in this chapter.
Poke around the Checkout Manager’s four modules. Make a few small
changes and save them. Publish your Order Settings. Place a test order (see
the next section) and see how what you did looks in your cart. Make notes
about what you want to change.
Testing your settings
Figure 14-1 displays where you preview changes to checkout settings in an
enhanced preview function of Checkout Manager. This preview is so much
better than the old preview of the cart and order form.
Figure 14-1:

217
Chapter 14: Checking Out the New Shopping Cart

You can also place real test orders on your store through the new cart without
enabling the Checkout Manager for your customers. When you first activate
New Checkout Manager, the special Yahoo! cookie (tracking file) redirects you
from the old cart and checkout to the store.yahoo.net checkout on the
published site so that you can see exactly what your customers will see with
the new checkout. If you hate your changes, you can also revert to the system
defaults or revert to the current published version of the checkout.
Be careful when you revert! If you’ve published your checkout settings, then
you can revert to them, but if you revert to system defaults, all your changes
are undone and all your hard work is gone forever!
Publishing your new cart
You have to publish Order Settings to update saved changes to the Checkout
Manager (whether you’re just testing or have enabled the real deal). If you’re
testing the Checkout Manager, after you publish Order Settings, you’ll be the
only one who can place test orders and see the new checkout. If you’ve
enabled the new Checkout Manager (which I don’t recommend yet), your
published changes are live for everyone to see.
Anytime you make a change, you need to save it. You can save by choosing
Save, which just saves your changes, or Save & Preview, which takes you to a
Preview window, where you can see what your changes look like on a sample
order. If you’re at a stopping place and like what you see, go back to the Store
Manager and Publish Order Settings to make the saved changes live on your
published store.
The easiest way to kill your sales is to screw up something in the checkout,
so I always place a test order on another computer after making any changes
to any part of checkout, Shopping Cart, or Shipping or Tax settings to make
sure that I haven’t blown up something. If I’m making major changes, I ask an
opinionated third party, like my brother or my assistant, Nikki, because I
know that they’ll really tell me what they think!
Controlling Checkout Flow 
with Global Settings
Flow, the number of pages for each step in the checkout process, includes
the Shopping Cart, Shipping Information, Billing Information, optional Order
218
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Review, and Order Confirmation stages. You can place each checkout stage
on a separate page or design a true one-page checkout that merges the cart
with shipping and billing info. You can also have a regular cart with a merged
shipping and billing page for a faster checkout.
Click the Checkout Manager link in the Store Manager and then click the Global
Settings link. The Global Settings’ Flow Settings page appears with clickable
tabs that link to the Checkout Wrapper and Checkout Settings pages.
Flow settings
You now have total control over the Order Flow from Cart to the Confirmation
Page with the new Flow settings.
On the Flow settings page, Checkout Options lets you choose either single
page or multipage checkout. Single page lets you to have a true one-page
checkout with shipping and billing on the Shopping Cart page, if you want,
which is good for single-item stores. (Make sure that you set your cart to
secure under the Variables page.)
The Shipping and Billing information page can be on the same page or 
separate pages. As Figure 14-2 shows, when you collect shipping and billing
information on the same page, the checkout feels a little crowded, so I recom-
mend a multipage checkout here. The shipping charges, based on dollar
amount and default shipping method, show in the Shopping Cart (which is
really cool), but watch out!
If you have same-page shipping and billing and remove the Order Review like I
do and if you have additional shipping rates (based on other shipping methods,
zip code, country, or state) or charge sales tax (unless the customer selects the
shipping method and clicks the Apply button), the customer sometimes doesn’t
get to see the real total until after he places an order. Some folks are going to be
royally ticked off when you charge them more than you said you would.
Here’s a quick fix: You can always add text to the message in the shipping
methods section that says “Make sure you click the Apply button to see the
cost of your chosen shipping method.”
The Shopping Cart section can be top- or right-aligned. This section isn’t
really the Shopping Cart, but the Order Summary on your checkout page,
which shows what someone bought with the code and options. Pick Align
Right to move the cart to the right, which pulls all the checkout functionality
closer to the top of the page.
219
Chapter 14: Checking Out the New Shopping Cart

You can set the Order Review Page to Show (the default) or Hide. I call this
page the “Are you really, really sure you want to give me money? You can still
back out” page. I recommend turning off Order Review if you have separate
Shipping and Billing pages because you’ll get more orders. However, if you
merge these pages, keep the Order Review page to stay out of trouble.
Checkout Wrapper
Checkout Wrapper is Yahoo!’s branding/navigation fix, which is the key to the
look and feel and consistency of experience during checkout.
The Checkout Wrapper has two parts:
 Company branding: You can upload a logo to Checkout Wrapper’s
Company Image field, but don’t, because you’re limited to a 250 x 50 GIF
file. Instead, choose Display Text and delete all the text in the field. Save
your changes. Use the HTML fields for branding with your logo.
 Checkout regions: Keeping a consistent look and feel across the site
through the checkout is much easier with Top Navigation, Side
Navigation, and Footer text fields for HTML.
Figure 14-2:
A combined
Shipping
and Billing
page may
look a little
crowded.
220
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

I recommend matching the branding and navigation of your regular Yahoo!
Store pages with these text fields, but don’t use the Top Navigation field
(header for HTML) unless you absolutely have to. Top Navigation pushes all
the checkout functionality down lower on the page, and folks have to scroll
to see the Continue or Place Order buttons.
Instead, use the Side Navigation field and put your branding, trust symbols
(such as the Yahoo! Shopping 5-Star rating, HackerSafe logo, TrustE logo, and
so on), and reassuring links to privacy policies in the Sidebar text field.
After you put the HTML code in the Side Navigation field and save, you still
have go to the Checkout Manager’s Page Configuration module, enable
Display In Checkout Page, and click the Save button for each stage of the
checkout where you want the Side Navigation field to appear (Cart, Shipping
Info, Billing Info, Order Review, or Order Confirmation).
Checkout settings
You can use checkout settings to enable Customer Ratings and Gift Options,
switch to alternate URLs for utility pages, and enable Yahoo!’s third-party
(read: paid) services.
Configuring Elements with 
Page Configuration
Page Configuration is where you can configure the various checkout page ele-
ments: customize Page Titles, display custom HTML, add HTML and JavaScript
to the head tags field, add custom fields, and have total control of standard
fields and their appearance with labels. Also noteworthy is the fact that Page
Configuration changes according to the Flow Settings in Global Settings. It’s
magic! Page Configuration shows you only the number of pages in your check-
out flow, whether you use a single-page or multipage layout, or choose to show
a review page.
Page Settings
You can control each page in your checkout flow with Page Settings fields,
including the text fields Title and Page Message, as well as the Top Navigation
Bar (display or hide), Side Navigation Bar (display or hide), and Pay Using
PayPal.
221
Chapter 14: Checking Out the New Shopping Cart

Max out your checkout by making the most of these important text fields:
 Page titles: Title tags appear in the upper left corner of your browser
window. You can improve your checkout’s Page Titles for branding and
giving shoppers confidence. Instead of a lame Page Title like “Shipping
Information,” try something like “SECURE SERVER: My Shipping Info:
YourDomain.com (1-800-555-1212).”
 Message fields: A simple text box allows you to put text or simple HMTL
on each Checkout page right above the checkout functionality. Add
order information and trust-building messages to woo customers at the
most important stage in the buying process. Keep text in the message
field as short as possible so as to not push the big green button down
any lower on the page than you have to.
Page Sections
Page Sections displays all the sections and fields for each of the different
checkout stages and is where you can add, edit, or hide standard fields and
add, edit, hide, or delete custom fields. You can turn sections on or off, too, 
if you don’t use them or want to streamline the checkout process.
Embedding marketing and trust messages within the structure of the new
Checkout Manager is an efficient way to get your message across using what
used to be wasted space. For example, I edit and rename Section Names to
add useful shipping information or marketing messages. For example, I
change “Shipping Address” to “Shipping Address: Most orders ship out the
same business day.” Also, I like to expand “E-mail Address” to “E-mail
Address: We promise to protect your privacy and personal information.”
Fields
Figure 14-3 shows how you control section labels and formatting. You can
edit, hide, or delete standard fields; edit the text on field labels; or hide indi-
vidual field labels completely. You also can add, edit, and delete custom fields
and control the type of field, length, acceptable data input, and so on.
222
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Here’s what you can do to fields:
 Hide redundant or unnecessary fields and field labels. You can turn on
or off individual fields. Use Do Not Display Field Name In Checkout to
keep the field, but not show the label.
 Change the type of buttons from radio buttons to drop-down, and so on.
 Edit field names. You can now rename the field labels for every field
within checkout. For example, change Coupon to Source Code
(Optional) to reduce the “I’m getting screwed because everyone has a
coupon but me!” factor, which can kill your conversion rate.
 Add custom fields. Collect additional information or enhance checkout
with text. Also, enhance your design by placing these custom fields at
the top or bottom of any section.

Advanced Settings
Here’s what’s you can do inside Advanced Settings:
 HTML Head Section: Put JavaScript or HTML code inside the head tags
field for each page in the checkout. For example, you can stick in track-
ing code from Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly Overture) or Google
AdWords to help you see which paid-search ads converted into sales.
See Chapter 21 for more info. Merchants familiar with CSS can also use
embedded styles to override their global CSS styles set by Checkout
Manager.
 Cookie Check Alert: The Yahoo! Shopping Cart requires cookies for 
customers buying multiple items. Cookies are very small files that Web
servers place on computers to identify and track users. On the Shopping
Cart page, you can turn the Cookie Check Alert on or off and edit the
text in the Cookie Alert Message. This text appears to shoppers who
don’t have cookies enabled in their browser settings. The Yahoo! Store
cookie can also store limited amounts of information and remembers
customer info (except any credit-card data) typed into Checkout pages
for two weeks. This cookie saves repeat visitors from having to retype
all their info and helps convert more return visitors when they see that
they don’t have to retype all their personal data.
Customizing Your Visual Design
You have almost total control over the visual design of the Shopping Cart and
checkout. Visual customization lets you use the default settings and edit those
with a Variables-like interface controlling the fonts and colors. Advanced users
can have almost total control using CSS (cascading style sheets) to format
text. CSS is a relatively new way Web designers use global style codes to
format HTML pages.
Technical reviewer Michael Whitaker says that you should not use a custom
CSS unless you’re, in fact, proficient with CSS and have the ability to test the
way the checkout looks on different browsers and platforms.
Global styles
Global styles control the appearance of fonts, text links, colors of sections
and subsections, and appearance of Checkout buttons. Choose Default Visual
Styles, Configure Visual Styles, or Custom Uploaded CSS. Go with the default
224
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

look or control the look of the cart with Editor-style fields where you choose
colors and fonts or control the look with custom CSS. Simply download the
CSS file, modify it at your leisure, re-upload it, and you’re done.
Progress indicator
A progress indicator is a way to show shoppers where they are in the check-
out process and how far they have to go. Choose custom graphics or CSS
(which I like better). Here are few things you may want to try:
 Change page titles in the progress indicator. Add calls to action in the
Checkout page names in the progress indicator to tell folks what to do.
For example, instead of simply saying “Shipping Information,” I prefer to
use “Enter Shipping Info.” You have only 25 characters, so you can’t go
too crazy.
 Choose progress indicator colors and fonts to match your style. I
prefer grayed-out text for visited and not-visited checkout stages.
 Upload custom images for progress indicators. When you upload your
own custom images for progress indicators, you have to upload three
separate versions of each step of the checkout process: visited, not vis-
ited, and current. Also, Step 1 is not the Shopping Cart like you’d think,
but Shipping Info (or Shipping and Billing if combined). Limit your
images to 170 x 25 pixels.
Checkout buttons
This trick is one of my favorite things about the new cart! Now you can replace
all the Checkout buttons with custom image buttons or standard HTML but-
tons, or you can just customize the default CSS buttons, which I prefer. You can
control the text with Button Label text and the look with Button Style.
Edit text on Checkout buttons to improve conversions. Use a call to action
and capitalization for emphasis. For example, I change the Cross-sell button’s
text from Order to Add To Cart. In the Shopping Cart, I change the Checkout
button to Proceed To Checkout. On the Billing Info page, I change Place Order
to Place Your Order.
You can edit a Checkout button’s type, too. I change the pesky little Apply
button that appears on the Shipping Info page to the right of Shipping
Methods from a CSS button to a text link to deemphasize it. The Apply button
is too close to the Continue button at the bottom of the page for my taste!
225
Chapter 14: Checking Out the New Shopping Cart

Tinkering with Advanced Settings
Advanced Settings is where they stuck everything else. I recommend not wor-
rying about Item Option Validation and setting it to No. For more information
on Item Option Validation, go to Chapter 15.
Also, the Revert panel lets you jump backward in time to the published set-
tings or all the way back to the default settings for the Checkout Manager.
Take good notes because you lose everything if you totally reboot!
Jumping to the New Cart
Hey! The new cart has bugs. The beta secure servers are a bit slower. Don’t
click the Enable Checkout Manager link unless you’re sure. I have a real store
that I play with, and it probably costs me eight to ten orders every time I
enable the new cart, but I’m finding out enough monkeying around with it to
make it worthwhile by the time they roll out the new cart.
If you do decide to enable the cart, you can jump back to the old V1 or V2
checkout by clicking the Disable Checkout Manager link in the Checkout
Manager.

Mastering the Store Manager
In This Chapter
 Managing orders inside and outside the Manager
 Notifying customers about order status and shipments
 Customizing your order form
 Shipping out stuff
 Setting up methods and rates
T
he Store Manager is order-processing central, your virtual customer ser-
vice headquarters and online control panel to configure and manage the
backend of your Yahoo! Store. The Store Manager is where they show you the
money! You can review, manage, and process your orders, submit credit-card
statements, and view statistics and reports of how well you’re doing.
New store owners use the Store Manager to set up their stores by customiz-
ing secure Checkout pages; setting up tax rates, shipping methods, and rates;
defining international order rules; writing customer notification e-mails; con-
figuring and uploading inventory; controlling which user IDs have access to
the store; managing mailing lists; and lots, lots more.
This chapter is an overview of the Store Manager’s many features with some
cool Store Manager tips and tricks thrown in. In my world, I focus on building
and marketing stores. When someone clicks the Place Order button, that’s
when the customer service folks usually step in. You need to know all about
the Store Manager, so I’m breaking out the good stuff for you. I’ve discovered
a lot watching my brother and regular clients manage their stores for almost
ten years, and now I get to pass it on.

Getting (Store) Help When You Need It
Everything changes. Staying on top of all the new features of Yahoo! Store is
tough! Seems like almost every time I look up, the fine folks in Sunnyvale at
the store division at Yahoo! keep adding useful features to the Store Manager.
Lately, most of the improvements are backend features like the Shipping
Manager (integrated with UPS Online), the new Checkout Manager (Chapter
14), Risk Tools (customized credit-card approval rules), and most recently
PayPal as a payment method or alternative to a Merchant Account.
When you find that you need help with all these new features, the Help files
are just a step away. Fortunately, Yahoo!’s online Store Help files have kept
pace with all the updates. Although it doesn’t seem that long ago when the
online Store Help files for Store Manager were a little skimpy (and almost
nonexistent for store building), they now rock! Yahoo!’s own king of content,
Paul Boisvert, and the Yahoo! Store folks do an outstanding job writing help-
ful, retailer-friendly online documentation.
Needless to say, it’s hard to stay on top of all the new information coming
out. To keep this book from turning into a four-volume set, I’m going to cop
out more than once and point to the helpful Store Help files. Here are my
favorite ways to get information and stay current on all things Yahoo! Store:
 Get some help (online). More than a thousand pages of searchable
online Help files detail exactly how features of the Store Manager and
other Yahoo! Store elements work. Start at http://help.yahoo.com/
help/us/store and browse around or use the search box in your Store
Manager.
 Download the Getting Started Guide. Yahoo! now also offers a free online
e-book, Getting Started with Yahoo! Merchant Solutions. This 384-page guide
covers everything you need to know about opening your store, with spe-
cific details on how to do the nuts-and-bolts stuff. You can download this
PDF file by right-clicking the link at http://help.yahoo.com/help/
us/store/guides and choosing Save Target As.
 Download other guides. Yahoo! also offers these helpful downloadable
guides in a PDF format: Open for Business Checklist, Checkout Manager
Guide, Order Processing Guide, and the Store Editor Variables Guide.
Download them all.
 Check the System Status page. While not exactly a Help file, this link
goes to an extremely helpful System Status page, which displays any
technical difficulties going on with the Editor. Hmmm. A little bird tells
me that this page may switch to a blog pretty soon. Cool! That means
retailers can subscribe to the RSS feed and get system status updates via
their news reader, my.yahoo.com pages, e-mail, Yahoo! Messenger, wire-
less phones, or all of the preceding.
228
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Getting Anywhere from Here
The Store Manager (see Figure 15-1) is the navigational hub for all things
Merchant Solutions. With the click of your mouse, you can jump to all the 
different Merchant Solutions tools: Domain, Web Hosting, E-mail, and the store-
building and product-management tools. Update your Yahoo! info under the
Manage My Services button, which links to your billing info (http://billing.
yahoo.com) and contact information as well as the Manage My Services page
(http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/services), with links to all the
Yahoo! products and services assigned to your Billing ID.
Click the Store Editor link, and you’re magically transported to my favorite
store-building and product-management tool, the Store Editor. (See Chapter 9
for lots of information about the Store Editor.) Adjacent to that link is the
View Site link, which whisks you to the published version of your store.
If you use the Yahoo! Web-hosting method for store building, the Store
Manager has links to Catalog Manager and Store Tags Hub. The Catalog
Manager is where you manage products and tables, track inventory, upload
and download items, and publish changes when you’ve finished updating
information.
Figure 15-1:
The Store
Manager 
is the hub 
of your e-
commerce
universe.
229
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

Inside the Catalog Manager, you can add, edit, and delete items; add custom
fields to product pages; view and update inventory; and publish changes in
your product database. You can also adjust products and inventory informa-
tion by hand or by uploading a CSV (comma separated value) file. The Store
Tag Hub organizes all the tools you need to use Store Tags, including a wizard
for generating store tags for specific products, prebuilt modules of Store Tags
code, and various Store Tags documentation. (For more information on choos-
ing a store-building method, read Chapter 3 and http://ystorebooks.com/
storetags.html for more information about the Store Editor and Store Tags.
Shipping and Managing Orders
Every Yahoo! Store owner I know uses the Store Manager somewhat differ-
ently. Usually this system depends on how each merchant processes orders
and the volume of sales he does. I often get excited about the different techni-
cal ways we can solve a problem, but sometimes the simplest system is the
best. Low-tech is sometimes the best answer, especially when the folks using
the system are technically challenged. (I’m not picking on you, Mom!)
Low-tech order-management solutions
Some folks barely use the Store Manager at all. After their shipping methods
and rates and taxes are set up, they’re done with the Store Manager unless
something changes. These retailers use order-notification faxes as pick tick-
ets and invoices, process credit cards offline outside of Yahoo!, and use
paper-based methods to manage customers, orders, and inventory. These
folks send shipping confirmation e-mails by hand by responding to the order-
notification e-mails. For these retailers, their Yahoo! Store is a marketing tool,
and the Store Manager has a lot of untapped potential.
I know of stores tracking more than 50 orders a day that are still using a
paper-based system — a 3-ring binder with a list of order numbers, customer
names, and a status code sits beside the phone. This method works even
when the power is out and there are no real tech-support issues, but this
solution won’t scale if a company’s sales double year after year.
Other folks simply use Yahoo! Store as a store-building and order-collection
tool and export customer and order data to use in third-party programs.
There are all kinds of cool features in the Store Manager that the majority of
my clients never use because by the time you need them, you’re probably
ready for more powerful third-party inventory, customer service, and order-
management tools.
230
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

High-tech order-management solutions
Some merchants use the Store Manager every single day. These merchants
live inside the Store Manager, processing credit cards online by first getting
authorization when a transaction is made and then completing the sales by
clicking the Sale button as they ship orders. These retailers use the Store
Manager as an order-management tool, too, updating order status settings
and sending tracking information from one central location.
Sometimes the Store Manager runs painfully slowly, especially during peak
usage times when other retailers are using the Manager. The Store Manager 
is slow to begin with because you’re on a secure server, but there are other
reasons, too. Some Store Manager functions require a lot of heavy lifting 
(creating order summaries and large export files). Stores with thousands of
products take longer to do product- and order-related functions (order-related
reports and stats, database inventory, and so on). Finally, you’re sharing
resources with 35,000-plus other Yahoo! Store owners on a limited number 
of servers. There’s a reason I code RTML and play with the Store Manager 
at 4 in the morning. It’s so much faster!
231
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager
Go with the (order) flow
The folks at my mom’s warehouse use mer-
chant-order faxes for pick tickets and place
picked orders at the beginning of the process-
ing line. At the beginning of each shift, Allen
exports customer and order data from the
Yahoo! Store Manager and imports that data
into Microbiz, a somewhat generic general
retailing inventory program (inherited from
Mom’s retail store that she’s almost outgrown).
This cycle happens a couple or three times a day.
David opens up Microbiz, pulls up the cus-
tomer’s record, double-checks the pick ticket,
and creates an invoice, ringing up all the items
in the box. David then runs the credit card.
When he gets an authorization code, he rings
out a Microbiz invoice, which removes the prod-
ucts from inventory and adds the order to the
customer’s history. He prints two copies of the
invoice: He places one inside the box for the
customer and tapes one to the outside of the
box for our records. The box is then packed and
sealed and placed next to the digital scale by
the UPS Shipping workstation.
Next, Jonathan imports customer shipping data
to the UPS computer’s free UPS shipping soft-
ware called UPS WorldShip. He pulls up the
customer record, creates a shipping record
based on ship method and weight of the box,
and prints a label. Jonathan sticks the label on
the box and puts the box by the loading dock,
where it waits until the UPS guy shows up. UPS
WorldShip also assigns tracking numbers, orga-
nizes and summarizes the daily pickup data at
the end of the day, and finally e-mails customers
with their shipping notification, estimated deliv-
ery date, and a tracking number.

I completely avoid using the Store Manager when I can during regular business
hours around the Christmas shopping season. On Mondays, the Manager
seems particularly slow because retailers are processing orders from over the
weekend. The best way to not bog down the Store Manager is to avoid perform-
ing multiple Manager tasks at the same time and always wait for one process to
finish before firing something else up in the Manager. Check out http://help.
yahoo.com/help/us/store/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-09.
html for more methods to make your Manager move.
However, just because the Store Manager is slow, it doesn’t mean that the
published version of your store is slow. Unlike the extremely powerful multi-
million dollar load-balancing system that handles the millions upon millions
of Yahoo! Store shoppers every single day, you share a Store Manager with
multiple merchants.
Power-user solutions
Power users export order info out of their Store Manager, import that info
into third-party tools to process and ship orders, and then export and upload
the updated info back to the Store Manager. Doing all the data crunching and
order processing offline gives you the best of both worlds: You get to use all
the power of the Store Manager with almost none of the drawbacks. You don’t
have to deal with limited Internet bandwidth or server-sharing issues, but you
also can automate everything and not have to touch each order by hand.
Super-advanced users who can program or have access to programmers can
actually have Yahoo! post the order info right into their own secure server at
the same time Store Manager gets the order. These guys can process orders
and generate an order status update file, which they e-mail to Yahoo! Changing
the order status to “shipped” automatically triggers a customer-shipping noti-
fication e-mail. See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/order/
retrieve for more info. Merchants with a Starter account need to upgrade to
get access to these features.
Third-party order-management software
Maybe I’m just grumpy, but I prefer to use anything but the Store Manager for
managing inventory, my customer database, sales reporting, e-mail, and so
on. You can visit http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/guides and
download useful application notes about some of these Yahoo! Store–friendly
third-party services and tools including, UPS Online Tools, Paymentech,
QuickBooks, Stone Edge Order Manager, and OrderMotion. I have clients
232
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

using one or more of these software packages. Here are some popular order-
management solution options for you to consider, with my commentary:
 Mail Order Manager (M.O.M.), from Dydacomp: I have Yahoo! Store
clients who swear by Mail Order Manager. One of my long-time clients
actually gushes when he talks about M.O.M.’s drop-shipping capabilities.
M.O.M. is available in several different versions, which allow you to buy
what you need and trade up later. Dydacomp offers modules for cus-
tomer management, order entry, order processing, inventory, purchas-
ing/receiving, accounting, point of sale, list management/mailing, and so
on. For a $25 refundable deposit, you can get a fully-working trial version
that comes with a coupon good for $100 off the purchase of a system if
you decide to buy. M.O.M. (www.dydacomp.com) is priced from $995 for
the SOHO version.
 StoneEdge Order Management Software: Designed for stores doing any-
where from 10 to 2,000 orders per day, StoneEdge (www.stoneedge.com)
lets you manage customers, inventory, and orders from your desktop.
StoneEdge folks support Yahoo! Stores and several other shopping carts,
such as MonsterCommerce (Hey, Steph!), Miva, eBay, and ShopSite.
Multiple Yahoo! Stores aren’t a problem as long as Codes are the same
on each store. This software is priced from $995, depending on the fea-
tures and support needed.
 QuickBooks: Lots of Yahoo! Store owners must use QuickBooks based
upon the number of questions I see posted online. My brother, Steve,
uses the online version of QuickBooks (http://quickbooks.intuit.
com) for bookkeeping, but I don’t really see QuickBooks as an inventory
or customer-tracking tool unless you have a really small number of prod-
ucts, customers, and orders.
 OrderMotion: Imagine being able to afford a site license to a million
dollar enterprise-level order-management software. If you were process-
ing tens of thousands of orders a day, it would run you less than a buck
an order! OrderMotion has a progressive pricing model that assesses
you a minimum monthly charge, but what you pay is based upon how
many orders you process.
OrderMotion is an online multichannel Yahoo! Store–compatible order-
management and inventory control platform with a killer feature-set.
Because it’s an online application and you pay a per-order fee, you can
have as many of your employees use it as you have PCs with Web access
at no additional cost. While it’s a little more expensive than some other
software, I believe you get what you pay for. I have several clients using
the software, and they say the additional cost is worth all the extra time
you get. Just FYI: I’m making the jump to OrderMotion as soon as I finish
this book, so watch my blog at http://ystore.blogs.com for tales
from the migration.

Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

Processing Orders — Show Me 
the Money!
The Store Manager is where you process orders, catalog requests, and gift
certificates. You can view orders one at a time, view a range of orders, view
or download a summary of orders, print anywhere from one order to hun-
dreds, and export your orders in a variety of formats.
When you get a new order, a red asterisk (or star) appears by the Store
Manager’s Process Orders link to let you know you have work to do. This red
star displays only for unviewed orders (or catalog requests) and disappears
after the first person looks at all the new orders, which can be confusing when
multiple people use the Editor. Don’t assume that you have no new orders just
because you can’t see the red star. Personally, I keep a watch on incoming
orders by always keeping an eye on my merchant-order notification e-mails.
Taking orders all the way to the bank
I want to see some orders! Here’s how you get to the orders so that you can
ship some stuff and get some money. To view any or all of your orders, click
the Orders link, which takes you to the Order Manager page (see Figure 15-2).
This screen summarizes customer order data since your store first opened,
with links to new orders, canceled orders, returns, and orders on hold.
Figure 15-2:
You can
access
orders only
through the
secure
server.
234
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

You can use the Order Manager to access individual orders by order number,
view a range of orders (which is slower to load), print orders (up to 1,000 at a
time), view a summary of orders, or export orders (up to 3,000 at a time) in a
variety of standard formats.
You can view specific orders in many ways, but the easiest way is to type an
order number inside the View A Specific Order field and click the View
button. The order appears with all the information collected in the checkout
process, including Shipped To info, Bill To info, e-mail address, payment
information, IP address (from the buyer’s ISP), merchant-rating information,
repeat customer information with links to previous orders (if any), and store
merchant notes. Here are things you can do in the Order Manager and what
you need to know about managing orders:
 Modifying orders is relatively easy. Click the Modify button, and you
can change the shipping or billing information, edit what the customer
ordered, add items, or recalculate shipping and tax. When you modify an
order, you’re reminded to verify prices and item codes. Click the Done
button to save your edits. Here are some things to think about when you
modify orders:
• Use Merchant Notes. When you change the status of an order, your
Yahoo ID, the date, and what you changed shows up under
Merchant Notes. You can also type notes to yourself. Just remem-
ber to click the Update button to save your changes.
• Delete bad orders. Mark bad orders as fraudulent, canceled, or
returned so that you don’t have to pay Yahoo!’s revenue share per-
centage on sales where you never got paid. You have 90 days to
mark an order as a return to get your revenue share fee returned.
When you mark an order as canceled, an e-mail is sent to the cus-
tomer to notify her.
Cancel bad orders before fraudulent customers have a chance to
rate you. Merchant ratings e-mails usually go out two weeks from
the day the customers placed their orders.
• Don’t scheme. You can’t cancel all your orders (or just the really
big ones) and not have to pay the revenue share fee, which is a per-
centage of your sales that Yahoo! collects as an additional cost of
doing business on its platform and pays for things like the multi-
million dollar load-balancing infrastructure and Jerry Yang’s PB&J
sandwiches. When a certain percentage of your orders gets can-
celed, Yahoo! starts looking. Y! reserves the right to contact your
customers and see what’s up.
 Summarizing a range of orders shows you the order ID (linked to the
individual order), customer name, address, number of items, subtotal,
order date, marked (for deleted orders), and % Completed. Click the
Export To Excel link at the bottom left of the page to download the data
in a CSV file. Sometimes I use the View Summary feature a little after
midnight to get a current daily sales figure. (I guess I’m a little obsessed,
235
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

especially toward the end of the month when I’m really close to breaking
a sales record.)
 Printing orders lets you choose to print the full order, an invoice, or a
packing slip. When you print a range of orders, each order is printed on
a new page. Click the Options button to change the file format from PDF
to PostScript or HTML (but why would you?).
 Exporting orders is an easy way to get customer and order data out of
the Yahoo! Store and into another order-management system. Exports
are available in the following formats: Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access,
Generic CSV, Mail Order Manager (M.O.M.), QuickBooks, PC Charge,
XML, and Plain Text. Click the Option button to set specific M.O.M. para-
meters. You can export up to 3,000 orders at a time, and bad orders
(marked fraud, canceled, or returned) aren’t included in the export file.
Exporting orders in Microsoft Excel gives you the option of downloading
individual data files or all the tables zipped up in a tar file, a zipped or
compressed file that can be opened with any standard compression util-
ity, such as WinZip. (See www.winzip.com for a free trial download.)
For more information on exporting orders and file types, see the Yahoo!
Store Help pages or the documentation.
Searching for that one special order
Sometimes you need to find an order very quickly with very little informa-
tion. The Store Manager’s Order Lookup feature (hidden at the bottom of the
Order Manager page) is pretty helpful, even if it’s limited to orders from the
past year. Search results supposedly show only the first 50 matching orders,
too. Now you can search orders by name, phone number, e-mail, address,
city, zip code, last four digits of a credit-card number, or order date.
Zip code is probably the best way to search using Order Lookup because zip
codes are short and easy for customers to give over the phone, most folks
know all their possible shipping zip codes, and you probably don’t have that
many orders from the same zip code in the course of the year.
Handling catalog requests
I used to use the Catalog Request form on my Yahoo! Stores to collect e-mail
addresses. Click the Catalog Requests link to go to a page that should be
called the Catalog Request Manager (but it’s not). Here, you can view specific
catalog requests, view a range, summarize, print, and/or export catalog
requests. You control the fields on the Catalog Request form with the Order
Settings’ Order Form page.
236
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Changing order numbers
By default, every Yahoo! Store starts out on order number 485. I highly rec-
ommend asking Y! to change your order number so that sneaky competitors
can’t figure out exactly how many sales you’ve had since you opened for
business simply by placing an order and doing a little math.
Call Yahoo! Technical Support at 1-866-800-8092 (press 2, 2, and then 2 for
Merchant Solutions) and ask the rep to change your order number. If the first
guy to answer the phone says he doesn’t know what you’re talking about or
can’t do it, just ask for a supervisor. Remember that you can only increase
the order number, and after the Store Support folks change it, they can’t
change it back. Be sneaky yourself!
Working with Credit Cards
Real-time online credit-card processing is pretty cool. Your customer places
an order; types in his card number, and billing info; and clicks the Send Order
button. The credit-card number, expiration date, billing address info, and CVN
(credit-card verification number — sometimes called the CVC, CVC2, CVV, or
CVV2, which is the 3-digit verification code found on the back of a Visa or
MasterCard) get sent through the gateway to the Merchant Bank. Then your
customers’ credit-card company (the issuing bank) compares the data on file
with the information your customer just submitted through the order form.
This point is where the Risk Tools kick in. Depending on how you configure
Risk Tools, for example, if the billing zip code and/or phone number on the
order doesn’t match the same info in the credit-card file, the transaction is
flagged for review. After the transaction is authorized, that money is held in
your customer’s account, but it’s reserved for you after your merchant bank
verifies the card info and gives you an authorization code. When you ship the
order, you click a button to charge the customer’s card. Later that night, a
batch with all your orders is sent through the credit-card gateway, and the
money is swept from your customers’ credit-card bank to your merchant
bank. Depending on the specific terms you have with your merchant bank
regarding how long it can play with your money, that money (less your mer-
chant bank’s percentage fee) is transferred to your bank account within a few
days or more. E-commerce is pretty cool!
For security purposes, Yahoo! deletes credit-card numbers after 30 days.
Also, credit-card authorizations are good only for seven days, so make sure
that you reauthorize any orders shipping more than seven days after an
order was authorized.
237
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

Setting up credit-card processing
To set up online credit-card processing for an existing account, you need to
contact your Merchant Account bank and make sure that it’s compatible with
FDMS Nashville. To get your Merchant Account bank to set up things on its
end, it needs to know the following:
 Product Name: Yahoo! Store FDMS gateway
 Product ID: 819000
 Vendor Name: Yahoo!
 Vendor ID: 190
Then you need to have your Merchant Account number, the bank’s name, 
and your MID and TID numbers. Open the Store Manager and click the Order
Settings link under Pay Method. Now click the Payment Processing Setup and
Management link. Because you already have a merchant account, click the
Set Up Existing Merchant Account link, and paste the information into the
corresponding fields. Go back to the Store Manager and publish order set-
tings, and then place a test order with a real credit card.
If you have questions, Yahoo! Store tech support is very helpful in setting up
credit-card processing. Sometimes your merchant bank will give you a test
Discover card number to use to verify that your transactions are coming
down the gateway to your merchant bank for approval.

Processing online orders
Here are some things you need to know about online order processing:
 When you use real-time online credit-card processing, you have to
click the Sale button on each individual Yahoo! Store order to charge
the customer’s credit card. Clicking the Sale button (see Figure 15-3)
puts the transaction into your daily batch and charges the customer’s
credit card after you close when the batch is submitted to your
Merchant Account bank. The card’s issuing bank sends the money to
your Merchant bank, and you eventually get paid.
 If you made a mistake on an order before a batch was submitted, you
can void the sale and charge the correct amount. Voided charges don’t
appear on the customer statement; only the corrected charge appears.
238
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 If you catch a mistake after the batch has been submitted, you have to
issue a credit and then run a second corrected charge. The credit
appears on the customer’s statement.
 If you forget to click the Sale button, you don’t get the money! Don Cole
of YstoreTools.com has a cool tool to make sure that you have charged
every single customer that you’re supposed to charge. If you process
credit cards online, then you must get Don Cole’s YstoreTools Yahoo!
Store Order Checker (www.rtmltemplates.com/order-checker.
html). Don’s nifty utility double-checks orders to make sure that they’re
either canceled or they were shipped and charged. This relatively simple
piece of software doesn’t do any other charging or processing, but for
$99.95 for the first year, it’s worth every penny! Additional subscriptions
are $30 a year.
Handling manual transactions
When you have phone orders or additional charges for online orders, you
have a couple of choices. You can place the orders online yourself or process
the order as a manual transaction. Placing an order through the store creates
a record of the order with an order number and gives you access to all the
features of the Store Manager, but you pay the revenue share fee.
You also can click the Manual Transactions link under Process. This link
appears only when you have activated online credit-card processing. Here,
you can process nonstore orders received offline by phone, fax, or mail. You
process offline orders just as you process online store orders. You can obtain
an authorization, process the sale, or apply credit. You can also void sales or
credits, but only before the batch has been submitted. In addition, you can
charge customers for sales of additional items. Manual transactions aren’t
subject to the Yahoo! revenue share fee, but like Momma always says, “You
get what you pay for. . . .”

Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

Processing cards offline
Many of my clients don’t process their orders online because they get a very
low credit-card processing (%) rate from their local bank. Sometimes a local
bank can be more competitive than an online processor because of the volume
of business the retailer does locally. For example, I know of one multimillion
dollar Yahoo! Store that still hand-keys orders through a terminal (just like in a
retail store) and saves up to $40,000 a year because of a preferred local rate.
Call your banker and ask what she can do for you.
Configuring Order Settings
My guess is that eventually the Store Manager’s Order Settings fields (shown
in Figure 15-4) will be moved to the Checkout Manager when it comes out of
beta testing to become the official checkout method.
Figure 15-4:

Settings
allow you to
customize
the order
form and
more.
240
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Customize Order Form (Checkout)
The Order Form link is located in the Store Manager under the Order Settings
heading. Clicking the Order Form link takes you to a page where you can
update the following fields and settings:
 New Checkout Flow: This setting allows you to use the second version of
the Shopping Cart (on all orders or just Yahoo! Shopping orders), which
arguably looks better than the old Viaweb checkout. I still recommend
using the old version of the Shopping Cart checkout. In 2006, Yahoo!
plans to offer a more customizable checkout called the new Checkout
Manager, but until then, use the old Shopping Cart. See Chapter 14.
 Checkout Branding: Upload a 250-x-50-pixel logo to appear at the top of
the Checkout pages; otherwise, text from the Title variable (usually your
store’s name or domain name) appears.
 Gift Options: Offer Gift Wrap (on the Shipping Info page), set a Price
(either per order or per item), and turn on the Gift Message, which is a
comments field to let customers specify a message to be included with
the order.
 Shipping Info Message: Add text and simple HTML here to appear at the
top of your Shipping Info page. The Shipping Info page is the first page in
the checkout that is hosted on the secure server. To increase customer
confidence, I link to my Customer Testimonials, 100% Satisfaction
Guaranteed, Your Privacy Guarantee, and Shipping Rates & Information
pages. To keep the customer on task, these links open new browser win-
dows with code like so:
<a href=http://www.yourdomain.com/info.html target=_blank>Shipping Info</a>
Most of the customers who start to order drop their Shopping Carts
right here before completing all those pesky fields, so anything you can
do to assure customers helps increase the number of folks who order. I
add a message like this:
“You’re now on our SECURE server. This is the SHIPPING INFO PAGE (1st 
of 2 pages). Prefer to order by phone? Call 1-800-555-1212. Your privacy is
guaranteed and your personal information is safe & secure. — Your Name”
 Billing Info Message: When customers make it to this point, they really
want to buy. Of the folks who make it this far, 95 percent place an order. I
like to put a message like this on the Billing Info page to close the sale:
“You’re almost done! Enter your billing info and payment method. Your
100% satisfaction is guaranteed. Order online with confidence, or if you
241
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

prefer, call us at 1-800-555-1212. 99% of orders ship out the same business
day. — Your Name”
Both the Shipping Info and Billing Info pages let you edit the existing
fields and add custom fields:
• Edit Standard Fields: Use the Yes/No drop-down list to control
which fields appear on the page.
• Edit Extra Fields: Add, edit, and delete custom fields that appear
on the Shipping Info and Billing Info pages. These custom fields
appear below Shipping Options on the Shipping Info page and after
the Billing Address block on the Billing Info page. Unfortunately,
you can’t change the order of custom fields, so you have to create
them in the order you want them to appear.
When you click the Add New Field link, you choose the page where
the field appears (Billing, Shipping, or Catalog Request). You can
edit extra fields to move fields from the Shipping Info page to the
Billing Info page if a custom field makes more sense there. You also
choose the type of field (Text, Hidden, Text Area, Info, or Check
Box), the length of the field, the field name, and a description. You
then choose whether the field is optional or mandatory.
 Order Confirmation Message: This is the text that appears on your
Thanks For Your Order page, which is what the customer sees directly
after clicking the Place Order button. This field is also where you place
the tracking code from Google and/or Yahoo! for conversion rate track-
ing, which I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 20.
I like to reassure the customer on the Order Confirmation page that she
will actually get what she ordered, and if something goes wrong, I’ll be
here to back up the sale. Be friendly and reduce buyers’ remorse as well
as reduce WISMO (Where Is My Order?) phone calls and e-mails to your
customer service staff. Thank the customer for her order, include any
information about delivery time and product availability, and even link
to your FAQ pages.
I use the same information here that I do in my Thanks For Your 
Order page:
Thanks for your order! Most orders ship out via UPS the same business day
received. Postal orders and orders with personalized products may take a
little longer. We will contact you by e-mail if we have any questions
regarding your order, or if there will be a significant delay in processing your
order.
Some quantity discounts, free shipping on certain Internet specials, and
shipping costs on Canadian orders may NOT be shown on this copy, but
WILL be reflected on your final invoice. If you have any questions about your
order, comments about our site, or anything else you think we need to know,
please e-mail me or call 1-800-555-1212. We appreciate your business! —
Your Name
242
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Order Status Message: I don’t really use the Order Status page for cus-
tomers, but if you do, the Order Status Message field is the place where
you can place a text message.
 Catalog Request: Edit the Catalog Request Form Title, add a test mes-
sage, and add or edit extra fields.
 Advanced Features: Be careful in making customers jump through too
many hoops, such as forcing them to format addresses a certain way or
limiting the lengths of fields. Use Field Length Limits to set the length of
fields to match databases. Choose whether the Order Button increments
quantity or simply takes the customer to the cart page when that item is
already inside his Shopping Cart. Here is where you turn on the Got
Email collection setting, which adds customer e-mail addresses to your
database. You can also activate Webloyalty’s Reward Banner Program.
(This company really ticked me off when it convinced Yahoo! to auto-
matically opt every store into its program without asking us first, but
now you actually have to turn it on.)
 Item Options Validation: This security setting makes sure that all your
Item Options (size, color, style, and so on) are in the correct format and
match your database as customers place an order. If you have tons of
orders (100-plus a day) and a high rate of fraud, you probably want to
set this option to Yes. However, if you’re like I am and know you have
some improperly formatted item options, then select the Allow Items
With Unrecognized Options To Be Placed In The Shopping Cart check
box. This setting allows all orders with options to go through whether or
not they’re properly formatted. For a lot more information on options,
see Chapter 12.
Fax/e-mail order notification
When you get an order, you want to know about it as soon as possible. The
Order System Settings page is where you set up your e-mail addresses for
order notifications, when they’re sent, and how the e-mails are formatted.
Credit-card information is not included in the e-mail. You can also set up fax
notification, time sent, and format. (Merchant Starter accounts don’t get
faxes.) We use faxes as pick tickets in our warehouse.
For example, I found out how handy the Resend feature was the first time our
ancient fax machine ran out of toner and kept printing (although you couldn’t
read anything). All you do is set the range of orders you want to have re-sent
and the merchant e-mail and fax notifications are resent (but not the cus-
tomer e-mails). This option is also helpful when your e-mail software or fax
machine has been down or offline.
243
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

Configuring inventory
Set your inventory options to None (which does nothing); Real-Time inven-
tory (for power users only), which queries a script on another server to
check your inventory; or Database inventory, which checks a CSV file you
upload to see whether an item is in stock.
If you ever want any repeat orders, you have to be honest with your cus-
tomers about what you have in stock and how long it will take for items to be
delivered. However, I recommend not using the inventory feature unless you
have a huge inventory (thousands of items), your inventory isn’t very deep
(only one or two of a product, and reorders take forever), or your inventory
fluctuates a lot (on a minute-by-minute basis). Even then, you must keep your
computer files current and update the Yahoo! Store.
When you turn on Database Inventory, an Inventory link appears under the
Process column. This link takes you to a page where you can upload or down-
load inventory files.
Payment methods
With the addition of the new Checkout Manager, Yahoo! Stores are now com-
pletely integrated with PayPal. Adding PayPal as a payment method is rela-
tively new, and it requires you to use the new Checkout Manager (which should
be out of beta test mode — or pretty close — by the time you read this book;
see Chapter 14). Please see the Yahoo! Help section at http://help.yahoo.
com/help/us/store/order/paypal for lots more info than I can fit in here.
Here’s what you need to know about using PayPal as a payment method:
 You must be a PayPal Premier or Business member to use PayPal as
your merchant account. If you have a personal account, you can
upgrade it. If you don’t have an account, you can apply for a new one.
 After you have an account at PayPal, you have to log in to your PayPal
account and turn on the APIs so that PayPal can talk with Yahoo!. See
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/order/paypal/
paypal-02.html.
 Back at Yahoo!, you need to identify yourself as who you say you are 
by logging in to your PayPal account, testing your account, and saving
any changes.
244
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

 Setting up a Yahoo! Store to accept PayPal as an alternate payment
option is kinda complicated. In the Checkout Manager’s Page
Configuration module, you have to enable PayPal on each of the various
pages, including the Shopping Cart, the Shipping/Billing page on a
merged checkout, or the Billing page on a two-step checkout.
 Because you’re bypassing the Yahoo! checkout, PayPal can’t be in the
drop-down list of Pay methods like Visa or MasterCard, but displays as 
a button below Payment methods. This button takes the customer from
the retailer’s site to the PayPal site and then back to the retailer’s site to
complete the transaction.
 If a retailer’s PayPal account isn’t set to automatic capture, the transac-
tion acts much like a typical credit-card procedure, where authorization
is requested at the time of purchase.
 Within 29 days of authorization, the retailer has to capture the autho-
rized funds (when the order ships) by going into the Store Manager’s
Process Orders, finding the order, and clicking the Capture Funds
button.
 After 29 days, retailers have only one more chance to reauthorize by
browsing to the order in the Store Manager and clicking the Reauthorize
button.
Again, read the documentation. The new Checkout Manager should be out of
beta testing sometime in early 2006, probably by the time you read this.
Setting tax rates
Setting up taxes is pretty straightforward. Pick your state, and the tax rate
appears in a field that you can edit. State legislatures seem to raise state
sales tax rates faster than Yahoo! can keep up with the changes, so contact
your local tax authority for current rates. For more information on tax 
settings, see http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/manage/
ordersettings/ordersettings-61.html.
Setting Up Your Sites for Success
The Store Manager gives you all kinds of different controls over your store.
Here’s how to control who accesses your store, set up custom 404 “file not
245
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager

found” error pages, and password-protect your published site if you ever
want to keep customers out of your site:
 Use the Store Manager’s Editor access page to control who has access
to the Store Manager and Store Editor by giving certain Yahoo! IDs lim-
ited permissions. Choose from three settings: All (which can do every-
thing); Edit Content & See Stats; or see Orders Only. You can add or
delete any Yahoo! IDs, but you can’t delete the master Yahoo! ID that cre-
ated the store account. You can’t delete yourself, which is a good thing.
 Email when site updates: Under Notification Preferences, select the
E-mail Me When My Site Is Updated check box and click the Change
button to get an e-mail sent to the main contact address whenever the site
is published. This option is very convenient for big stores with lots of
products because it may take 15 to 20 minutes for large sites to publish.
This e-mail lets you know that your site is published so that you can check
out the changes on the published site or go back into the Store Editor.
 404 Error Pages/Page Not Found Handling: When someone types a 
URL for a page that doesn’t exist or clicks an old link to a page you have
deleted, Yahoo! automatically redirects him to a copy of your home page,
such as http://yourdomain.com/youraccountname. This redirec-
tion may be confusing to users, but it’s also bad for search engines
because it may look like you have a duplicate copy of your home page.
Search engines tend to penalize pages that they think are exact or close
copies of other pages, so you need to create a custom 404 page.
Go into the Store Editor and create a page with the ID 404 (or whatever
you want the error page’s ID to be). Make the Name field something like,
“Whoops! Sorry! The page you are looking for no longer exists.” Add
some text like the following to the Caption field for users: “Try the site
search to find what you were looking for, or try these links to our most
popular pages.” When you’re happy with how your new error page looks,
publish the site and then go back to the Store Manager’s Preferences page
and change Page Not Found Handling to “Use a custom Store Editor page
Custom” and enter the ID in the field. Click the Change button. Publish
your order settings and then, in about 5 minutes, look for a page that you
know doesn’t exist.
 Domain Names: Merchant Solutions stores (after 9/24/2003) control
their domains under Manage My Services. See Chapter 24 for more on
domains.
 Customer Access: The Customer Access link is sometimes mistaken for
the Access link. This feature allows you to enable passwords for viewing
the published site. You create the username and password. I have sev-
eral wholesale clients who use this feature to hide wholesale pricing
from their regular retail customers, but because the information isn’t
super, super secret, we just use customer e-mail addresses for both the
username and password.
246
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

Setting Up Shipping Settings
A simpler shipping model is so much easier for you and your customers.
Think about shipping as a marketing cost and not as a profit center. Free
shipping sells stuff online, and if you make this offer, create a shipping
method called something like: “FREE SHIPPING via UPS Ground (Orders over
$99 US48).”
I use the Ship-weight field on individual products to add costs to super-bulky
or heavy items, especially on express methods.
Shipment and order-status e-mails
The main reason I use Yahoo! Store is because it’s so easy. A perfect example
of this ease is setting up and sending customer Order Confirmation E-mails.
To turn on this feature, all you do is click the Shipment & Order Status link,
type your e-mail address in the Order Confirmation E-mail field, and click the
247
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager
Customer ratings give you good feedback
Allow customers to give you feedback on shop-
ping with your store by activating merchant rat-
ings on the Order Form page (under Order
Settings) in the Customer Ratings section. You
can also specify a separate e-mail address for
receiving customer ratings e-mails. See Chapter
3 for more info on ratings.
Customer ratings appear on the Store Manager
page. You see how many responses you have, a
graph of your ratings, and a comparable graph
to all of Yahoo! Shopping. If someone gives you
a bad rating and you fix her problem (and you
know that she’s a happy customer), or if some-
one screws up and rates you badly even when
his comments were positive, or if someone
doesn’t respond to the first Ratings Request
E-mail, you can always give it a second shot.
Click the Rating Request Email link on the right
side of the individual order page to be sent to a
form where you can add a message to your cus-
tomer and resend the Ratings Request E-mail.
Customer ratings are visible on Yahoo! Shopping
and, combined with a relevancy score, deter-
mine how well merchants who participate in
Yahoo! Shopping rank in the search results.
Y!Shopping merchants are required to enable
ratings.
I wouldn’t recommend surprising any (possibly)
unhappy customers with a “second chance”
customer ratings request. Also, folks who never
rated you the first time may view a second
request as spam, so be careful. See Chapter 22
for more e-mail dos and don’ts.

Publish Order Settings link on the Store Manager page. Order confirmation
e-mails are then automatically sent to customers immediately after they place
an order. Here are a couple of other things you need to know about:
 Confirmation e-mail: Please change the Confirmation E-mail because the
default text is “This email is to confirm the receipt of your recent order
from Yhst-17192271484370,” which is pretty bland. I use the same infor-
mation that’s in my Order Confirmation page; see the section
“Configuring Order Settings,” earlier in this chapter.
 Shipment tracking: The Store Manager has some pretty impressive 
shipment-tracking features that notify customers via an e-mail alert and
change shipping information on the Order Status page when you make a
change in an order’s shipping status. You can edit this information man-
ually on the individual order page or (power users only) by e-mailing an
XML file containing the order number, the status change, and a pass-
word. See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/order/
retrieve/retrieve-12.html for more information on automating
shipment-tracking updates.
Shipping Manager
The Shipping Manager is a new addition to Merchant Solutions. Recently 
all the old Yahoo! Stores were automatically upgraded with the Shipping
Manager, which allows you to calculate shipping, set free shipping, offer dif-
ferent shipping methods, accept foreign orders, create shipping tables, set up
shipping rates and rules, and experiment with a shipping and tax test before
publishing order changes. See Chapter 3 as well as Yahoo!’s Help page at
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/shipping for more on the
Shipping Manager.
UPS shipping tools
UPS WorldShip is software that runs on your computer that’s hooked up to a
digital scale and thermal label printer you rent from UPS. Sometimes UPS
loans you a PC at no charge when you ship enough stuff. WorldShip lets you
import customer address information from your Yahoo! Store so that you
don’t have to retype labels.
After you pack and ship all your boxes, you can upload tracking numbers and
update shipment statuses to your Yahoo! Store. WorldShip also shows you
current UPS rates (without fuel surcharges), and you can track packages
248
Part III: Building and Managing Your Store 

through www.ups.com, print labels for each package, view and print proof of
delivery, create international documents, and batch-process end-of-day files
so that your UPS driver doesn’t have to scan every box you ship. I use it. It
rocks!
See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/shipping/shipping-51.
html for more information on integrating UPS WorldShip with your Yahoo!
Store or just download the files at http://store.yahoo.com/lib/vw/
Yahoo-UPSWorldShip-documentation.ZIP for some cool stuff!
Merchant Starter accounts can’t export to UPS WorldShip because they lack
XML export ability.
Shipping foreign orders
It’s a small world after all. And now they’re telling me it’s flat again. Shipping
internationally is not as easy as some folks make it out to be, but if you have
the profit margins and the ambition, maybe you can be the next Dutch East
India Trading Company. Not me!
249
Chapter 15: Mastering the Store Manager
UPSOnline Tools: Is it the right tool for the job?
UPSOnline Tools is now integrated with Store
Manager, so you can process orders and online
shipments within the Store Manager. You can
print UPS shipping labels from your information
without having to retype info or even export
data from Yahoo! to another platform. It also val-
idates customer address information.
UPSOnline Tools is kind of like UPS WorldShip
but it’s an online application, so you need
Internet access to print shipping labels and
process orders. To get UPSOnline Tools to use
real-time shipping methods, you have to use the
official UPS Rates and Service Selection for
shipping methods.
In theory, it sounds great! Personally, I get really
nervous when several unrelated techni-
cal things I have no control over have to work
at exactly the same time for orders to come
through or for me to process orders. The origi-
nal reason I didn’t use real-time UPS shipping 
is because the UPS shipping server had to 
be functioning when someone was placing an
order. I’m the guy who processes credit cards
offline, too, so when someone’s card gets
declined, at least I have the chance to call him
and try to save the order.
I also don’t want UPS giving my customers error
messages at the point of purchase when they
don’t type their addresses in just right. I prefer
having a simpler shipping rate table, which is
easy for customers to understand, than exact
UPS rates. My shipping rates with free shipping
offers are a marketing tool, not a profit center. I
prefer to process my shipments offline, but I do
export order information from Yahoo! Store.

You control which countries can place orders under the Foreign Orders link
under Order Settings. You can choose from a default list of countries, opt for
USA only, pick the countries you want from a list, or select all countries. Just
because a country isn’t listed doesn’t mean that international customers not
on your list won’t try to place an online order. Also, not to be an isolationist,
but we eliminated all foreign orders except Canada (home of Geddy Lee,
Todd “Oilman” Friesen, and Andrew Goodman), and our sales dropped 2 per-
cent, but our problem orders dropped 25 percent, which was a very, very,
very big deal, eh. I recommend that beginning retailers avoid the complica-
tions of international e-commerce until they have totally mastered the
domestic arena.

Part IV
Profiting from
Internet Marketing

In this part . . .
I
n this part of the book, I talk about my favorite subject:
profiting from Internet marketing no matter where you
live. I live out in the sticks, three miles out in the country
just outside a sleepy little college town in rural
Mississippi.
Living in Starkville (pop. 25,000) is great! All my family
is here (six nephews!), and with the university, you can
always find something to do, especially if you like college
sports. The cost of living is extremely cheap, the people
are nice and well-educated, crime is nonexistent, and the
town is almost recession-proof because the college is
here. But there’s always been a downside.
As a brick-and-mortar retailer, my store’s success has
always been limited by how many people could physically
get to my store and shop. That was a big problem. But not
anymore! With the Internet, I now have access to every
other retailers’ customers! This makes a big difference in
what and how much I can sell. For example, one of my
stores just passed one million visitors for the past year.
Holy cow! I couldn’t imagine that kind of foot traffic in a
retail store in these parts!
Finding your best keywords, optimizing your store pages
for search engines, and buying paid search ads are the
keys to successfully marketing your Yahoo! Store. In this
part, I cover how to get more Web traffic, how to maxi-
mize your use of keywords, and how to make sure that
your store is found when shoppers are looking to buy
what you’re selling. I also introduce several other ways
to market your business online.

Chapter 16
Searching for the Right Words
In This Chapter
 Unlocking the secrets of how shoppers search

 Seeing how shoppers search when they’re almost ready to buy
C
hoosing the right keywords for your business is the foundation of a
smart Internet marketing strategy. The key to driving more qualified
visitors to your online store is to make sure that you rank well in the search
engines when folks search for your best keywords.
After eight years of selling online, I’ve figured at least one thing out: You’ll
make more money when you focus on the exact search terms buyers use to
find your store, and then optimize your site and buy pay-per-click ads for
those converting keywords. By targeting more of these potential buyers at
the exact moment they’re in a buying mood, you get much more bang for
your buck out of your advertising budget.
Whether you target online traffic by optimizing your site to appear higher
and higher in the free search results or by buying your way to the top with
paid-search ads, or both, you’re much more likely to increase your Yahoo!
Store’s sales by focusing on the keywords that convert into cash than by
chasing any other kind of traffic.
In this chapter, I show you the difference between good search terms and
great ones. I also cover how to mine keyword gold hidden deep within your
Yahoo! Store, how to discover new keyword phrases using online keyword
research tools, and how to continuously collect, categorize, classify, and
consequently cash in on your converting keywords.

Introducing Keywords
Keywords are the search words users type into search engines when they’re
looking for something on the Internet. Keyword, keyword phrase, search word,
and search term all mean the same thing: The words folks are typing into that
search engine’s search box to find your Yahoo! Store.
The most important thing about search marketing is knowing the most popu-
lar and the highest converting search terms buyers use to find what you sell.
These search terms are your converting keyword phrases. When you know
what exact keyword phrases convert for you, you can do everything possible
to make sure that your store ranks as high as possible in the search results
for those specific words and phrases in both the free search results and pay-
per-click results.
Some keywords are more popular than others. Some keywords generate more
sales than others. But what you’re interested in is the subset of search terms
called converting keywords. These phrases are the words actual shoppers
type into the search engines when they’re ready to buy what you sell.
Lots of Yahoo! Store owners get distracted chasing extremely popular key-
words. These popular keywords have a lot of searches, drive a lot of traffic,
and sometimes convert into sales. They’re also very, very competitive.
Popular keywords are extremely hard to rank for search engines, and pre-
mium positions with paid-search ads are often cost prohibitive. I’ve had
much more success going after the less popular but higher converting key-
words, but if I rank well for the popular words, too, that’s great.
Often, my consulting clients aren’t aware that they’re sitting on buried key-
word gold in their e-mail inboxes and Yahoo! Store References and Order
data. You have valuable information hidden all over the place, and I’m about
to tell you how to find it and dig it out!
Considering Where Keywords Come From
Because keywords are so important, it’s very helpful to see where keywords
come from. Consider what happens when a searcher types a specific keyword
phrase and clicks the Search button. The search engine results page (or
SERP) that appears is a combination of several different sources of informa-
tion working together to find what the searcher is looking for, whether that’s
free information or product pages. This chapter is about making sure that
your store is found in as many of those different places as possible when
folks are looking to buy what you sell. Conquering keywords is the key to
making the most of Internet marketing.

Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Figure 16-1 shows a search results page from a search on Yahoo! for the key-
word phrase dog beds. Take a closer look at a search results page and notice
all the different elements, especially paid-search ads and free search results.
When you surf to Yahoo!, type a keyword phrase into the search box and
click the Search button, several things happen:
 Yahoo! Search pulls free results from its search index and shows the
Top 10 Web pages for that search phrase. These Web pages are listed in
descending order by relevancy sorted by a top-secret, always-changing
algorithm. The free search results from Yahoo!’s search engine appear
under the sponsored results.
Pre-2003, Yahoo!’s free search results were limited to searches from the
Yahoo! Directory supplemented by secondary results from another
search engine. Yahoo! then used rebranded results from Google until last
year, when Yahoo! started its own search engine.
 Yahoo! Search Marketing displays paid-search ads, which are triggered
by the keyword phrase searched for. These Sponsored Results (pay-per-
click text ads) are sorted in descending order by bid and appear above,
to the right, and at the bottom of the free results. The top three to four
ads (Premium Results) appear above the free listings and get most of
the clicks, so advertisers are willing to pay top dollar for premium
positioning.

Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

Paid-search advertising is one of the best ways you can get qualified
shoppers to your online store. Because most businesses can’t break into
the Top 10 positions in the free search results to save their lives, they
get their wallets out and buy their way to the top. For the lowdown on
paid search, see Chapter 18.
Advertisers bid for position by keyword, and their rankings move up
and down all day as advertising budgets get maxed out, or advertisers
change bids.
 Yahoo! Shopping links appear when Yahoo! recognizes a search term
as a product search. Yahoo’s shopping portal was built on the Yahoo!
Store database with thousands of merchants with millions of products.
At one time, the only way into Y!Shopping was to open a Yahoo! Store
or sign a $250,000.00 annual Featured Merchant contract. Now anyone
who is willing to pay-per-click can participate in Yahoo! Product Submit.
Yahoo! charges different rates for different industries. These pay-per-click
(PPC) rates can range anywhere from 15 cents to $1 a click. For a current
rate card, see https://productsubmit.adcentral.yahoo.com/
sspi/us/pricing.
 Yahoo! suggests several more specific keywords when search terms
are pretty generic. When you use pretty broad search terms, Yahoo!
helps you out with a list of popular, related, more specific keywords.
This “Also try . . .” list is good for surfers, but great for marketers look-
ing for more keywords.
Most people search for general phrases and then become progressively
more specific as they home in on what they want. For example, if you
sell pet products, you might see more search traffic from the keyword
phrase dog beds, but more specific searches like big waterproof dog beds,
large red cedar dog beds, or discount acme dog beds will convert at a
much higher rate than general phrases.
Oddly enough, search results pages for Yahoo!, Google, MSN, AOL, and
Ask.com look very similar. These search engines also change their search
results page design often and switch advertising network partners every time
I turn around. Most of the SERP layouts are similar to the format initiated by
Google, with free (organic, natural) search results on the left and paid-search
ads on the right, with sometimes two or more ads in the premium real estate
at the top above the free listings.
AOL Search has a slightly different feel than the other search engines. AOL
now offers Smartbox Suggestions on the fly while you type. AOL also shows
more keywords with Web Offers & More, which gives you more AdWords ads.
256
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Conquering Converting Keywords
Converting keywords are as good as cash because they’re the search terms
that result in online sales. While the majority of online searches are queries
for one- or two-word phrases, converting keywords are usually three-word,
four-word, five-word, or even longer keyword phrases. These keyword phrases
are often very specific, including the product name with the manufacturer’s
name, brand, model number, and/or a modifier or two. A good example of a
very specific converting keyword phrase is Eastover 05 Stealth Connexion -9
Senior Bat, which weighs in at seven words!
When you know your top converting keywords, you can easily monitor your
progress in attracting traffic from both free search-engine traffic and paid-
search ads.
Converting keyword phrases can be very obscure. They don’t tend to show
up in the various keyword tools. You won’t find most of these phrases in the
top 100 traffic keywords. The last time I analyzed my own sites’ converting
keyword phrases for the last six months, more than 300 of the single-order
converting keyword phrases were so obscure and specific that they had 100
percent conversion rates. That percentage means one search, one order.
If you follow the search-marketing industry at all, you hear industry folks talk
about the “long tail of search.” What they mean is that millions and millions
of unique keyword phrases get only one or two searches a month, at best.
If you stop and think about it, the longer a keyword phrase is, the more spe-
cific it is, which really helps a search engine deliver only the most relevant
pages in its search results. When your product pages are relevant enough to
rank for extremely specific keyword phrases, the odds are visitors will find
what they’re looking for and convert into sales at a much higher rate than vis-
itors who don’t really know what they’re looking for.
Also, if your paid-search ad or free listing in the organic results has the exact
keyword phrase a customer typed into a search box, you’re much more likely
to get the click because your page speaks the customer’s language. And if
your product is named exactly what a shopper is looking to buy, you’re going
to get the sale. I call this phenomenon the “Hey! That’s exactly what I’m look-
ing for” effect.
Think about the language potential customers use when you name your prod-
ucts. Sell folks exactly what they’re looking to buy. Consider making multiple
versions of your products with different names to sell the same thing to dif-
ferent types of buyers.
257
Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

It’s so easy to optimize your store for these phrases because you have virtu-
ally no competition. The best way to rank well on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN
searches for these very specific search terms is to beef up your store’s prod-
uct pages and write tons of unique content for your site. Write FAQs and
articles about the products that you sell, answer customer questions,
write product reviews, provide solutions to problems your customers
may have, and generally inform the people who use the products you sell.
(See Chapter 19 for more on optimizing your store for search engines.)
Lots of folks keep keyword lists. You’re more interested in your list. My con-
verting keywords are different than your converting keywords, even if we sell
the exact same thing. Different stores have different styles, attract different
kinds of customers, and sell differently.
Collecting converting keywords
Collecting converting keywords may be the most important concept in this
book. Your Merchant Emails and the orders themselves from Yahoo! have
keyword gold in them, and I’m not talking about the credit-card information,
either. A little more than half of the orders in my Yahoo! Stores show which
search engine the order came from and which keyword search was used to
find the site and turned into a sale. Look at the Referrer for the referring
search engine (and sometimes the keyword used). Look at the Rev-Share URL
field for the full search-engine search string, which shows both keyword and
engine. For example, a URL might look like www.google.com/search?hl=
en&q=keyword+phrase where you can see the keyword phrase embedded
in the URL.
You can pinpoint your converting keywords using many different methods,
but my favorite is looking at referring search-engine data in your Merchant
Order E-mails and in the orders themselves shown in the Store Manager.
Digging keywords out of your orders
One way you can find your converting keywords is to look at the orders
themselves. In Store Manager, click the Orders link under the Process head-
ing to see orders placed on your Yahoo! Store. The Retrieve Orders screen
appears. Click the View button, and the last order placed appears.
If an order has referring search-engine and keyword data attached to it, you
see the Entry Page (which is the first page someone went to on your site), the
Referrer (which shows you the source of the traffic and sometimes the key-
word), and/or the Yahoo! Rev-Share URL (which sometimes has the keyword
embedded in the URL). If you use Yahoo! Store’s Track Link feature, this infor-
mation appears on the order, too.
258
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Figure 16-2 shows you an example of an actual order containing converting
keyword information. In this order, the customer purchased about $130
worth of stuff.
The order shown in Figure 16-2 gives me a lot of valuable information:
 The order from this customer came from a repeat visit. I can tell because
the click came from an e-mail newsletter, which means that the customer
placed a previous order or signed up on the newsletter list. The Track
Link appears as Link from 05.05.05-SPECIAL Text Link, which even tells
me what link the customer clicked on in a specific e-mail. For more on
track links, see Chapter 18.
 I know the customer originally came from a Google AdWords ad because
the Referrer shows him coming from a www.google.com search for the
word tritronics, and his Entry Point shows his entry page on the site to
have a Google AdWords landing page embedded in the URL string:
tri-tronics1.html? engine=adwords &keyword=tritronics.
 The customer bought two additional items from the related cross-sell
items we display in the shopping cart, which you can see by the icons
next to the items with little arrows and plus signs. For more on cross-
selling and other merchandising techniques you can use to increase
your sales, see Chapter 13.

Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

 The Rev-Share URL shows another search on Google for Dog Den 2 —
www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Ddog%2Bden%2B2. The
%2B are encoded space characters. If you hold your nose just right, you
can see the keywords dog den 2 right there in the URL. I don’t know how
many times I’ve seen Dan Boberg of Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly
Overture) present at search conferences, but the last time I did, he said
that the average customer makes more than a dozen different searches
before buying something. Holy cow!
When I’m looking at orders in the Store Manager, I click the link shown in the
Referrer or Rev-Share URL and visit the search engine to try to re-create the
exact search results page that the customer saw, so I can see exactly what
the customer saw. I discover more about how people search (and shop) by
replicating these exact customer searches on an order-by-order basis. I see
what ads and free listings prompt customers to click. I don’t check every
order, every day, but I try to do it as often as I can. The search engines seem
to change results every few days, and paid-search ads change as budgets get
spent, so the closer to the actual order time I check on the link, the more
likely I am to see exactly what the customer saw.
Prying keywords out of product reports
You can extract your converting keywords product by product through a cool
report that most Yahoo! Store owners don’t really know about. The Sales
report lists the products that are selling well. You can sort the various prod-
ucts by the number of items sold, order count, or revenue, but I always sort
by revenue because that’s where the money is!
260
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 
Playing with orders
When you do a Sales report, when an item has 50
or fewer orders in a given date range, the Orders
number becomes a link back to a summary report
of all the original orders for that specific product.
When you see 50 orders for the same product
with all the search-engine and keyword data for
one specific product all on one page, you can see
some really cool things — converting keywords
being the coolest! You can usually see where the
customer came from (Referrer) and what he
searched for (Rev-Share URL).
Only products with less than 50 orders in a given
time frame have a link to the orders. Why
exactly? My guess is that because it takes a
while for the Store Manager to generate these
pages of orders, more than 50 orders would
take too long or overtax the server.
On your bestselling products, you’ll have more
than 50 orders in a year. How can you see all the
orders? Simply shorten the time frame to get the
number of orders down to less than 50 by
selecting the radio button with the next shortest
time frame. Try the last 180 days (6 months), but
if you have a ton of orders, you can do it month
by month for the last 6 months.

Here’s how to get your top 200 converting keywords out of your Sales
reports:
1. Go to your Yahoo! Store Manager.
2. In the Statistics column, click the Sales link.
Your top 50 product sales from the last 365 days appear sorted in
descending order by the number of items sold. The first 50 items appear
261
Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words
Converting keywords really are worth more!
The following table shows stats from a real
Yahoo! Store with about eight weeks of really
good sales data from early 2005. I exported the
data from software called EngineReady (www.
engineready.com) and totaled up the date
in Excel. More than 10,000 unique keyword
phrases generated almost 81,000 visitors from
free search-engine traffic and paid-search ads.
It’s time to start separating the wheat from the
chaff!
Nonconverting keyword phrases: The bad
news is that almost 9,100 of the top 10,000 key-
word phases sent more than 55,000 visitors to
this Yahoo! Store, but those visitors didn’t place
a single order. Ouch. Still, it’s good to know what
keywords are popular, but didn’t convert. I’m
sure some of these folks may have placed a
phone order, bookmarked the site for later use,
or deleted their cookies so that I lost the ability
to track them, but for now, I’m not losing sleep
over these keyword phrases.
Converting keyword phrases: The good news is
that more than 900 other keywords converted
into sales and sent 34,000-plus visitors who
spent over $142,000. That’s more like it!
What’s weird is that the top 150 converting key-
words (ranked by revenue per phrase) didn’t
generate the majority of the sales. By dollar
volume, 55 percent of all sales came from 758
unique keyword phrases with just one order per
search term. These single-sale keyword
phrases averaged almost a 9 percent conver-
sion rate, too! These obscure phrases are liter-
ally worth their weight in gold. What phrases do
you think I’m optimizing for and buying pay-per-
click for now? Oh, yeah!
It’s pretty sad, but thinking about what I can do
with converting keyword data keeps me up at
night! I think I need to get a life.

Revenue is really what you’re really interested in. Configuring the Sales

stores I work on.
5. Click the See More link again to bump up the number of products to
200 products.
After you have six months or so of sales on your Yahoo! Store, you can really
see what words buyers use to find what you sell. Until then, you just don’t
have a big enough sample. You can compile a list of converting keywords
from simply looking at your orders. Having access to all this converting key-
word info is kinda cool, but it sometimes takes years to develop these lists. If
you have a new Yahoo! Store, you probably don’t have years and years to
wait to jump into PPC advertising.
Working with Your Top
Converting Keywords
Now you’re convinced that converting keywords are critically important and
that you must collect them. I keep my converting keyword list of all the
words that converted into sales on all my Web sites in Microsoft Excel, and I
have thousands of these phrases. Here’s what I do with this very valuable
information after I collect all my converting keyword phrases:
 Classify converting keywords. I split the list into product-specific key-
words and more generic searches that need to be sorted into groups.
 Categorize nonproduct converting keywords by sorting them into dif-
ferent buckets so that you can save time and work on similar search
terms at the same time. A bucket is a just a funny name for a group of
similar things (keywords, products, customers, landing pages, or any-
thing else you want to organize). I like saying “bucket” and using it as a
verb! You can group your keywords into buckets in a variety of ways.
262
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

You can bucket keyword phrases by manufacturer, by product type, or
by the type of customer. Most keyword phrases are easily sorted into
their corresponding bucket.
For example, say that someone bought a baseball bat and the converting
keyword phrase was Eastover Junior League baseball bat. I have at least
three different ways to bucket that phrase: by manufacturer (Eastover),
by league (Junior League), and by product type (baseball bat). Usually a
store has anywhere from 40 to 100 different buckets or groups of key-
words, depending on the variety of merchandise sold and how detailed
you want to get in your categories. I prefer to work with one bucket at a
time when buying paid-search ads and optimizing pages for search
engines, but especially when I’m slopping the hogs. Woooo, pig, sooey!
 Pick a page for each converting keyword phrase so that you use that
page as a landing page for paid-search ads (see Chapter 18) and so
that you can optimize that page for free search-engine traffic (see
Chapter 19). The easiest way to select a specific page is to ask yourself
what the most relevant page on your site would be if a new visitor could
see just one page. Look over your most popular section pages and make
sure that you have good landing pages for these converting keywords.
Here’s how I pick pages for several different types of converting keywords:
• Product-specific keywords should use the actual product page as
a landing page. For example, someone searching for the phrase
Dental Kong DK1 needs to be directed to that specific product
page, so I optimize the DK1 product page for that converting key-
word phrase.
• Buckets of similar keyword phrases usually match up nicely with
a specific Yahoo! Store section page or two. Make sure that these
words are used in the Caption on their matching section pages. For
example, with my softball site, if the keyword phrase is Eastover
Junior League baseball bat, then the section is Eastover and the
subsection would be Junior League bats.
• Keyword phrases without a matching section page give you the
opportunity to create new section pages to match those key-
words. For example, if you have a dog store and folks are searching
for Irish Setter chew toys and Irish Setter dog beds, you probably need
to make an Irish Setter section in your Shop By Breed category.
• Brand-specific keyword searches do better matched to Shop By
Brand pages. Experience tells me that folks who search by brand
are ready to buy, and they want that specific brand. For example,
if someone searches for Konga brand chew toys, she needs to be
directed to the Konga product page, not the more generic Chew
Toys page, which has products from Kong as well as other brands.
263
Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

Unfortunately, you don’t control which pages come up for search queries in
the search engines, but you can control exactly which page prospective cus-
tomers land on when you buy paid-search ads. See Chapter 18 for what you
need to know about buying paid-search advertising.
 Check your rankings on the top three search engines to see how well
you’re positioned for each converting keyword phrase. You want to be
in the top ten results on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, but I aim for the top
three rankings. You’ll definitely see a correlation between high rankings
of specific keyword phrases and record-breaking sales. When the search
engines are churning all around like they tend to do, I can tell how my
sales are directly affected by how well I rank for certain critical convert-
ing keyphrases.
Here’s how to keep up with your search rankings:
• Begin by checking your search engine position by hand on each
engine for each keyword, one at a time. Just do a search for the
phrase and pray. Your site should appear in the top ten results. If
not, you have some work to do. I tell you how to optimize your
Yahoo! Store for search engines in Chapter 19.
 Eventually you can automate your ranking reports for your top con-
verting keyword phrases. I love using Bruce Clay’s tools at
SEOToolSet.com to check my ranks and analyze my pages. In the past,
I’ve also used Web Position Gold (www.webposition.com). See
Chapter 25 for more info on the tools you can use.
After you start ranking well for lots and lots of converting keywords,
you don’t have to worry about your search-engine position for every
single word or phrase on every single engine so that you sleep a little
better at night.
 Buy paid-search ads on Google and Yahoo! Search Marketing (and
soon MSN) for the exact same collection of converting keywords. I buy
anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 keywords on a given project, so I never
can remember what I’ve bought and what I haven’t. To help keep track, I
take my converting keyword phrase and do a quick PPC check.
I search on Overture.com to see whether I’m buying that word with Yahoo!
Search Marketing, and I search on Google to see whether I’m buying it on
Google AdWords. If not, I add it to my list of words to buy. Because I’ve
already got a landing page for each keyword (or bucket of keywords), the
only work I have to do is to write a compelling search ad. See Chapter 18
for more about buying your way to the top with paid search.
I record all this information in my Converting Keywords Excel file and do it
again tomorrow when (hopefully) I’ll have a whole new batch of converting
keywords.

Seeing How Your Shoppers Search
You need to know how shoppers search. People don’t just search for some-
thing, click an ad or free listing, and then go to an online store and buy 
something. Shoppers go through several different stages of searching.
They start with gathering information about what’s available. Then they shop
the features of different brands until they find what they want to buy. Finally,
they compare retailers by looking at prices, shipping options and costs,
taxes, and product availability.
Shoppers who are ready to buy use more brand-name queries right before
they make their purchase. These customers know what they want to buy,
including the make, model number, and style of the product. If you have a
competitive price, they just want to see whether you have it in stock, when
they can get it, and how much shipping is going to cost them.
You want these customers to find you when they’re searching, because
they’re about to open up their wallets. Sometimes these folks haven’t even
been to your store. They may have been doing their information gathering on
other competitors’ Web sites. This search is your only shot at getting these
folks to your store, so you want to rank well, so hopefully Joe Customer will
click your store’s listing.
The higher a product’s price, the longer the buying cycle (the time it takes for
someone to buy it). For more expensive purchases, shoppers have to think
about their purchases, do their homework, and generally get more comfort-
able with a retailer before shelling out their dough. I cover increasing conver-
sion by earning visitors’ trust in your Web site in Chapter 21. If you sell lower
priced items or impulse-buy items, then you’ll have a much quicker selling
cycle with customers spending less time on research, fewer searches to actu-
ally buying something, and generally higher conversion rates.
Researching Keywords
Several online tools are available to help you with your keyword research.
The paid-search advertising networks (Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search
Marketing) have some free tools, and several third-party software companies
have tools like Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com), Keyword Intelligence
(www.keywordintelligence.com), and Trellian’s Keyword Discovery (www.
keyworddiscovery.com), where you pay a reasonable subscription fee to
access their massive online databases.
265
Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

Overture’s free keyword selector tool
Overture, formerly Goto.com, is now Yahoo! Search Marketing. Its ad network
has millions of keyword searches each month, which are incorporated into a
big database, usually after the first of the month. Fortunately for you and me,
the folks at Y!SM are nice enough to share their data.
To access Overture’s free keyword suggestion tool, go to http://inventory.
overture.com, type your keyword phrase into the search box, and click
the arrow button. The search results page appears and tells you the number
of times that phrase was searched for last month across Yahoo! Search
Marketing’s entire network. Every time a person does a search on Yahoo!, MSN
(for now), Overture.com, and the rest of their network partners, those searches
are added to the total number of searches. You also see a list of related
searches that include your keyword phrase (with up to 100 subphrases).
When you know a few things about these numbers, you’ll take these monthly
search figures with a grain of salt:
 Overture Keyword Selector Tool combines singular, plural, misspellings,
and even some broad matching terms in these search counts.
 More popular search terms have their monthly counts skewed by PPC
rank-checking software, where PPC advertisers automatically check
their Overture position by running search queries every few minutes.
 Lots of advertisers search on Overture.com to see their ads’ position,
and these searches inflate the monthly keyword counts. Some popular
words seem to have a lot of rank-checking inflation, while some obscure
terms have none.
For example, when you read that 64,639 searches occurred for dog bed in
March 2005, that number includes dog bed, dogbed, dog beds, and every time
an advertiser (or his software) checked his ad position for that keyword
phrase on Overture, as shown in Figure 16-3.
When you play with the Overture keyword tool, start with your most general
root keyword so that you can see all the related subphrases containing that
word. For example, if you’re selling dog beds, type the word dog. The tool
shows you every related keyword phrase that contains the word dog, which
may give you some ideas on other popular products you should carry.
Google AdWords free keyword tool
You can use the Google Keyword Sandbox at https://adwords.google.
com/select/main?cmd=KeywordSandbox to generate additional keywords
or to see which related keywords can trigger your ads.
266
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Google gives you three types of keyword suggestions: More Specific Keywords,
Similar Keywords, and Additional Keywords:
 More Specific Keywords is a list of other keywords that includes your
keyword phrase. Google advises you to buy these specific phrases
instead of using broad matching to catch these keywords. If you’re 
selling dog beds, then some examples include best dog beds, big dog
beds, bolster dog beds, bowser dog beds, cedar dog beds, cheap dog beds,
and so on.
 Similar Keywords are keywords that are related to your keyword phrase
and that trigger your ad if you select broad matching. (For more on
broad matching, see Chapter 18.) These keywords are synonyms and
singular or plural variants. For example, if you’re searching for dog beds,
then some examples include dog bed, pet beds, and pet bed.
 Additional Keywords are mostly modifiers that you can use to expand
your entire list or add to your negative match list for words you don’t
want to buy. For an ad campaign on dog beds, my negative match list
starts with the word cat. (For more on negative matching, see Chapter 18.)
Negative matches for dog bed ads include cat, club, hammock, humane
society, kennel club, photos, pics, picture, pictures, pictures of, rescue, 
shelters, and spca.
Additional keywords are usually modifiers and include other names for
your products, synonyms, trademarks/brands, styles, retailer names,
misspellings, geographic terms, and other related products.
For example, good modifiers for a dog bed ad campaign include heating,
igloo, kuranda, large, luxury, orthopedic, outdoor, pads, pet bedding, puppy
beds, therapeutic, thermal, warmer, waterproof, and wicker.

Wordtracker keyword research tool
Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com), shown in Figure 16-4, is a subscrip-
tion-supported keyword tool based in the United Kingdom. The Wordtracker
keyword tool pulls its data from various meta-crawlers and their search
queries for the past 60 days with a database of keywords from 373 million
search queries. Meta-search engines combine results from multiple search
engines (Google, Yahoo!, MSN) so that their numbers aren’t skewed by PPC
bidding tools or SEO position-checking software like Overture. I log into
Wordtracker the first thing every morning and run the tool all day long.
Wordtracker may be a little expensive, but it offers many benefits:
 Wordtracker gives you separate search counts for each search term for
singular and plural, all misspellings, and even capitalization.
 You can import a list of keywords from another source to see how many
searches a day your keywords receive.
 Wordtracker has a deal with Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly
Overture) so that you can automatically see what different Overture
clients are bidding for each keyword phrase, which saves a lot of time
when you have a big list of bids to check.
 Wordtracker allows you to drill down into each keyword, find related
phrases, add the words you want to your keyword list, and expand the list
to include all the related phrases you want. You can then get the Overture
bids for each keyword phrase and export them in several formats.

(Meaning) elements of style
Search marketer Tor Crockatt created the con-
cept of keyword meaning elements to break
keywords into their smallest components that
still have a meaning relevant to your site. After
she has a keyword list broken down into the
various meaning elements, she can mix and
match all these modifiers with all these root
keyphrases and build massive lists of keywords
in a big ol’ Excel spreadsheet.
Sometimes the smallest meaning element is
a two-word phrase. A perfect example is the
keyword phrase Yahoo! Store, a compound
phrase with a singular meaning. I really don’t
care how I rank for Yahoo! or how I rank for the
word Store, but I’m very concerned with ranking
well for Yahoo! Store. Tor says there are seven
types of meaning elements: comparison words,
product/price adjectives, intended use, type of
product, manufacturer, geographic modifiers,
and action verbs. Here’s an example using most
of these element types: hire best US Yahoo!
Store designer for cheap online store facelift.

 Wordtracker has a synonym generator, which simply pulls a list of syn-
onyms from a thesaurus database.
 Wordtracker’s KEI (keyword effectiveness index) analysis allows you to
see how many competitors (and competing pages) you have on each
search engine for each keyword. I don’t really use this tool, but some
keyword researchers swear by it.
 You can keep up to seven separate projects or lists of keywords.
 Compressed search (combining results from capitalized and noncapitalized
search results) is wonderful for grabbing keyword data. I use it multiple
times a day.
Okay. With less than 400 pages in this book, I can barely scratch the surface
of what you can do with Wordtracker, much less all these other tools. Take a
day when you have nothing to do (yeah, right!) and play on Wordtracker all
afternoon or evening. For around $8, you can get full-day pass access to
Wordtracker. I bet you’ll sign up for the $200-a-year deal the next day.
Tracking Converting Keywords
Converting keywords from your paid-search ad campaigns are easier to track
than the converting keywords from free search-engine traffic because you
can use free conversion tracking tools offered by Google AdWords and Yahoo!
Search Marketing (formerly Overture), in addition to watching Yahoo! Store
referrer data.

Chapter 16: Searching for the Right Words

When you put this tracking code on the Order Confirmation Page of your
store’s checkout, it tells Google or Overture that a visitor from a paid-search
ad bought something, and this code ties this order to the keyword search
that resulted in a sale. Google or Overture then pulls this data back into its
database, and you can see which of your keywords and which of your ads are
converting and driving the most sales to your Yahoo! Store. See Chapter 20
for more on the magic of metrics and consult Chapter 21 for conversion rate
improvement ideas, but commence collecting converting keywords quickly
or consider the consequences!

Driving Traffic That Converts
In This Chapter
 Revving up the search engines with SEO and paid search
 E-mailing for fun and profit
 Discovering multiple marketing methods
You don’t just want to attract more traffic to your Yahoo! Store; you want
more folks to actually buy something. You need to fish for the right kind
of fish, use the right kind of bait, and fish where the fish are biting, or you’re
going to go hungry tonight.
In this chapter, I tell you all you need to know and more about fishing for the
right buyers, introduce you to search engine optimization and pay-per-click
ads, and fill you in on lots of other ways to get more buyers to your Yahoo!
Store.
Fishing the Right Way
When I tell you to “Fish for the right kind of fish,” I mean that you should
target the folks who spend the most money, buy the most profitable products
you sell, and buy from you again and again. You don’t want the little minnows
who may place a small order and then never return. You probably also don’t
want the Great White sharks — international buyers who want to order a 
container-load of what you sell and pay you cost plus a dollar.
You also want to fish with the right kind of bait. You’re an expert in what you
sell, right? Your search-engine marketing must show that and speak your cus-
tomer’s language. Your search listings have to tell that guy to click your ad
and buy from you. Shopping with you is better than shopping with the other
guy, even though he probably sells the exact same things you do.
Lastly, you need to fish where the fish are biting. If your customers are soccer
moms who have never changed their home page from MSN.com, you’d better
show up under the MSN free search results and buy Yahoo! Search Marketing

(formerly Overture) ads. If your customers are tech geeks who only search
on Google, then you need to rank in the free search results and buy Google
AdWords. If your customers are sports fans who live on Yahoo! Sports, then
you need to be all over Yahoo!

Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 
“What one man can do, another can do.”
The Edge (1997) is one of my favorite movies. I
can watch it every time it shows up on my TiVo.
A billionaire (Anthony Hopkins) and his super-
model wife’s favorite photographer (Alec
Baldwin) survive a pretty horrific seaplane
crash and are trapped in the Alaskan wilder-
ness. Things get really hairy when a big ol’ griz-
zly bear gets a hankering for a billionaire
sandwich. In short, Mr. Billionaire (realizing that
humans have survived bears and worse for
centuries) motivates Mr. Baldwin’s character to
help him fight the bear with this mantra: “What
one man can do, another can do.”
He’s absolutely right. Things are a lot easier to
do after someone else has shown you that’s it
possible! Not only does this mindset work with
man-eating grizzly bears, it also works with
succeeding online. Thousands and thousands
of other people are making a living selling
online, and you can do it, too. Here’s my grizzly-
bear story:
My brother and I launched our first Yahoo! Store
way back in April 1997, when Yahoo! Store was
still called Viaweb. My mom and dad’s dog-
supply store was under siege from a new
PetSmart store, which opened literally across
the highway. Our store’s sales had taken a
tremendous hit, and we were looking for any-
thing to generate revenue. Fortunately, we had
an 18-month head start because we knew
PetSmart was coming, and large companies
make a lot of noise when they sneak into a
market. My folks had started the business as a
mail-order company way back in 1972, and we
went back to our roots, ramping up the catalog
side of the business. We spent hundreds of hours
creating a small black-and-white dog-supply
catalog that we mailed to everyone on our mail-
ing list, which got almost no response — maybe
$5,000 in orders in six months, which was
nowhere near enough to offset our lost sales.
One night, Mom saw an AT&T commercial on
TV where two (fictional) female inventors/entre-
preneurs opened an online store to sell their
floppy sunglasses because they couldn’t get
snooty brick-and-mortar retailers to carry their
products. The light bulb went off! Mom became
obsessed with that commercial. All she ever
said was, “Get me on the Internet. I know we
need to be on the Internet!” She would not stop
talking about getting online, so to appease her,
I built a simple five-page site with a catalog
request form. After I got listed in the Yahoo!
Directory, we started getting hundreds of cata-
log requests. My dad freaked. He said we
couldn’t afford to mail all these catalogs with-
out knowing that they would generate sales, so
I had to either cut off the Web site or put our
catalog online and sell products that way.
In 1997, I knew absolutely nothing about Web-
store design, Web-site development, or online
marketing. I was a graphic design major turned
retailer selling comic books and baseball cards
for a living. I was also in charge of all our print
marketing campaigns. I had friends who were
Webmasters, and were supportive, but I had no
Web-development experience. To get an online
store built seemed doable, but I didn’t know
where to start. Then Steve found Viaweb’s
online store builder and everything seemed to
come together.

Cranking Up Search-Engine Marketing
Search-engine marketing (SEM) is just a part of Internet marketing, but these
days, search engines drive the most traffic. Search-engine marketing consists
of two parts: free search and paid search. You use search engine optimization
for getting listed and improving your rankings in the free search results
(sometimes called organic, natural, or unpaid), and you buy paid-search
advertising (called paid-search, pay-per-click, or sponsored results).
Every day, millions of folks search Google, Yahoo!, and MSN for stuff that they
want to buy. Anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of search-engine traffic comes
from free search results, and anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of users click on
pay-per-click ads. You need to crank up your search engine marketing to
drive this traffic to your Yahoo! Store.
273
Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts
Fortunately, we already had the raw materials
to build a site with 50 or 60 pages of catalog
descriptions and graphics from our failed paper
catalog attempt, and we started our store.
While building the most basic online store, I did
research at night for ways to get people to the
Web store. I knew I needed traffic, but had no
idea how to get it. How about buying some ban-
ners? Because the Yahoo! Directory seemed to
do so well, I called Yahoo! advertising, and
those folks wanted a one-year contract with a
$10,000-a-month minimum for a banner cam-
paign. Wow! There was no way we could afford
that. What about finding some other small guys
like me and partnering with them?
One of the first things I did was to poke around
and try to find all the popular sites where, unbe-
knownst to them, our future customers were
hanging out. I found a very active community of
dog enthusiasts that had a hopping message
board, tons of classifieds, a full calendar listing
dog events all over the world, and many free
articles. The site had a huge user base and did
regular e-mail newsletters. I contacted the
owner of the site and got his rates for banner
ads, which were extremely reasonable.
I talked to my dad about running $750 worth of
banners, and I thought his head was going to
explode. “No way.” Well, I thought it would
work, so I did it any way. I told Mom what I was
doing and put it on my credit card, so it was my
gamble. Eventually, I signed a contract for three
months for $250 a month.
That one site generated the majority of our rev-
enue until we got picked up in the search
engines and in the Yahoo! directory. The first
month, we sold more than $5,000 worth of dog
products, which is actually still a pretty good
first month for an online store, but this was way
back in May 1997. Ever the loveable curmud-
geon, my dad, ponied up the $750, and I was in
charge of online marketing from then on!
I think our initial success with sponsoring ban-
ners on a content site really spurred us on to
take Internet marketing seriously and discover
the ins and outs of selling on the Net. It bothers
me to no end to think what may have happened
had I not taken that calculated risk (besides
being out $750). Some risks are worth taking,
and you’ll never know it if you don’t try. “What
one man can do, another can do.”

Driving free traffic from search engines
Google, Yahoo!, and MSN can send you hundreds of thousands of visitors a
year. I have seen free search-engine traffic generate millions of dollars in real
sales to real Yahoo! Stores.
Nowadays, only three search engines matter: Google, Yahoo!, and MSN. AOL
is powered by Google, and the fifth engine that almost matters is Ask Jeeves
(which is powered by Teoma). The Big Three are so big that the smaller
crawlers, directories, and portals just don’t have enough traffic to move the
needle. You’ll get some traffic and sales from all these little sites, but if you
want to sell something, you’d better be well-ranked in the Big Three.
Introducing search engine optimization
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of making changes to
your Web site to rank better for relevant keywords in the search engine
results pages (SERPs). Most effective SEO is done in two ways: by implement-
ing the current best practices and by testing new methods, tracking your
results, and then keeping what improves your rankings.
The two basic building blocks of search engine optimization are text and links.
Text refers to the words on the page — visible text you can see and a search-
engine spider can read. If you can see it on your screen and highlight text with
your mouse and cut and paste it in a text editor like Notepad, then it’s visible
text. A link is a hyperlink pointing to the page from other pages on your site or
from other sites. I go into a lot more detail about SEO in Chapter 19, but here’s
what you need to know:
 Text: You want to have keyword-rich text on each of your pages using
your most relevant keywords in well-written product descriptions and
other useful content such as product reviews, articles, FAQs, and more.
These keywords also appear in various HTML elements in places like
your title tag, meta keywords and description tags, inside header tags,
body text, and links on your site.
These HTML elements are generated by the product information you
type in your Yahoo! Store product database in the fields Name, Headline,
Code, Caption, Abstract, Label, and the site-wide variable Final-Text, and
you can see them on any Web page by choosing View➪Source and view-
ing the actual HTML source code of the page.
274
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

 Links: You also need links pointing to each page. The links can come
from your site (internal links from your other pages or navigational text
links), or the links can come from other people’s Web sites linking to
your Yahoo! Store. Good examples of other folks linking to you are
directory listings, resource pages, reciprocal link exchanges with
similar sites, suppliers and manufacturers linking to their retailers,
product review sites, and even people linking to you from their blogs.
Buying search-engine traffic with PPC ads
The search engines finally figured out how to make money and still provide
value to their users. In addition to the free-search results, search engines now
display paid-search ads (also know as sponsored links or pay-per-click ads)
above and to the right of the free results. Shoppers are searching — a lot.
Here’s how paid-search ads work:
1. Select the search terms or keywords relevant to what you sell that you
want to trigger your text ads as folks search for those words.
For more info on keywords than you ever probably want to know, see
Chapter 16.
2. Write search listings (text ads) for each keyword.
These text ads consist of a title, a short description, and your URL.
Writing good ads is important to get qualified buyers to click your ads.
Tell folks why they should shop with you, but ads with less hype do
better. See Chapter 18 for more on creating effective paid-search
advertising campaigns.
3. Determine how much you can bid for each keyword.
Paid-search ads are sold by the keyword, and ad position is auctioned
off to the highest bidder. Advertisers who bid more get better position
on the page, which drives more traffic. You control your ad’s position by
how much you bid on each search term.
4. Submit your keywords and ads.
Yahoo! Search Marketing ads get reviewed by a person, and a few days
later, they appear across the Ad Network. Google AdWords spot check
your ads with software and then get around to reviewing your ads. The
folks at Google like to automate everything through software with an
algorithm, which is pretty smart. I guess I would, too, if I could!
5. When users search for your keyword phrases, your ads appear in the
search results pages in order by bid amount.
You pay only when someone clicks on your ad.
275
Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts

If you want to guarantee that you’re in the search engines, buy pay-per-click
ads. If you want to guarantee top positions for your keywords, then bid high
amounts for your keywords. He who bids the most gets positioned the highest.
Fund your account and sell some stuff online!
Marketing with E-Mail Newsletters
E-mail marketing with newsletters is a great way to keep in touch with your
customers and prospects, target offers to specific groups of customers, and
boost your Yahoo! Store’s sales and profits. The flip side is that when used
incorrectly, e-mail marketing is the easiest way to tick off your customers.
By spamming them with too-frequent or irrelevant e-mails, you can also run
afoul of ISP bandwidth or spam filters, and nowadays, the legal implications
of sending unwanted e-mail have huge penalties for the smallest mistakes.
E-mail marketing can be extremely effective, but it does have many pitfalls.
I cover e-mail marketing in detail in Chapter 22.
Before you start your e-mail marketing, stop and read Seth Godin’s Permission
Marketing to change your marketing mindset. Permission Marketing (Simon
& Schuster) is an awesome book and a must-read for any online marketer.
Mr. Godin was way ahead of his time in recognizing the value of someone
saying, “Hey. I’m interested in what you sell. Please e-mail me when you have
something I need to know about.”
Directing Traffic from Directories
Directories are the Web’s equivalent of the yellow pages, essentially huge lists
of links, where Web sites are reviewed, cataloged, sorted, and categorized by
type of site, usually by human editors. Directories are important for many 
reasons, but mostly because they offer you a source of qualified traffic, an
easy way to get high-quality links, and a place where search-engine spiders
begin crawling the Web to find your site.
Sometimes you have to pay to get a directory listing, and sometimes you get
a free listing. There are big directories that try to cover everything on the
entire Internet, little niche directories that focus on specific industries, and
everything in between. These tips get you started in the right direction:
 The Yahoo! directory (http://dir.yahoo.com) is probably the most
popular example of an online directory. Yahoo! started off in February
1994 as Stanford grad students David Filo and Jerry Yang’s personal
bookmarks and has since grown into a world-class media company.
276
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

In the good ol’ days, a Yahoo! Directory listing was free. A good Yahoo!
listing was the Holy Grail of the Internet because Yahoo was the #1 source
of visitors and sales. It’s ironic, but Yahoo! doesn’t use the directory as the
main source for search results on Yahoo.com because Yahoo! now has its
own search engine.
A Yahoo! Directory listing is still a good thing to get if you can afford
the $300 or so a year. Links from the Yahoo! directory are very helpful
from an SEO standpoint with the other engines. Lots of search engines
start spidering the Web following links from directories like Yahoo! and
DMOZ, so being in the Yahoo! Directory gets you in some search engines
right away.
 DMOZ (a.k.a. the Open Directory Project) began as an alternative to
the Yahoo! Directory, offering free listings for quality sites. The direc-
tory is staffed by an all-volunteer army of editors who maintain their
individual category pages in their particular areas of expertise. 
There is no cost to submit a site to the DMOZ, but there’s also no guar-
antee that your site will get a listing, even if your site rocks! Almost
everything depends on your category editor. Before you submit your
store to the directory, you need to make sure that your site meets
several requirements:
• Make your site unique. The DMOZ isn’t anti-commercial, but if
your store looks like a hundred other stores in the same category
with the same exact products and descriptions, you probably
won’t get a listing. 
• Make sure that you submit your site to the proper category, and
only submit your site once. Multiple submissions only get your
site deleted because the DMOZ keeps up with how many times
your domain has been submitted and in which categories.
• Be patient after submitting. Wait a couple of months before even
starting to worry about it. You can always ask the powers-that-be
to take a look at your site’s submission by posting a help request
at www.resource-zone.com.
• Be polite and respectful. Read the site’s guidelines and lots of
other posts before you ask senior editors to review your listing
request because you may only get one shot.
If you get a link in the Yahoo! Directory and the DMOZ, you’re ahead of 95 per-
cent of the other stores out there, but take a look at other directories, too. Lots
of these directories are free or cheap. I recommend taking a look at About.com,
JoeAnt.com, GoGuides.com, BOTW.com, Gimpsy.com, and Zeal.com for folks
really hungry for links!

Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts

Heeding the Call of the Mall
What better place to be than in a mall when you’re a retailer? Shopping portals
like Shopping.com, Yahoo! Shopping, and BizRate have lots of shoppers, but
they also have high rent and tons of competitors. If you’re buying paid-search
ads, you’re probably in the shopping engines already because many of them
feed their supplemental results with ads from Google AdWords and Yahoo!
Search Marketing.
Sometimes you get listed at no charge because the shopping sites (Froogle,
Shopping.com, and BizRate) sometimes pull product data from your Yahoo!
Store’s XML feed. Every Yahoo! Store has an XML document containing prod-
uct information that’s updated every time you publish your product catalog
data. For more information on the turning on the XML feed, see Chapter 15.
Getting listed in Yahoo! Shopping
With tens of thousands of stores, millions of products, and more than a bil-
lion dollars a year in sales, Yahoo! Shopping combines product search with
comparison shopping. Yahoo! Shopping was originally built on a database of
Yahoo! Store merchants and products, and now it’s open to anyone who will
pay, pulling product data from both Yahoo! and non-Yahoo! merchants, and
additional results from crawling the Web to find stores and products.
Yahoo! Shopping is currently in third place after Shopping.com and BizRate,
with a 14.4 percent market share in the shopping search business.
Users can compare prices and features among merchants as well as review
products. Shoppers also get to rate merchants in multiple categories (cus-
tomer service, fulfillment, pricing, and so on), which is why Merchant
Solutions customers are required to enable customer ratings.
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions customers and Yahoo! Store (legacy) customers
have their product data pulled directly from their stores. To flesh out the data-
base, Y!Shopping also actively spiders the Web, looking for additional prod-
ucts, and includes nonpaying Yahoo! Stores data, but these stores rank poorly.
Get your wallet out because you’re gonna have to pay. To sign up for
Y!Shopping, go to your Store Manager and click the Yahoo! Shopping link.
Create a new Product Submit and fund your account with a credit card. You
pay a cost-per-click fee for each visitor (anywhere from $0.15 to $1, depending
on how your products are categorized). You get a leg up on the competition
because Yahoo! Stores get a 20 percent discount off the rate card, which you
can see at the following Web site:
http://productsubmit.adcentral.yahoo.com/sspi/us/pricing
278
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Your success in Yahoo! Shopping depends in a large part on whether your
products appeal to the average consumer, how much competition is inside
Yahoo! Shopping, and how well you optimize your product listings. Yahoo!
Shopping is now an open platform, which means more competition for me
and you. Shopping search results are sorted by several factors, including how
relevant your product listings are, the quality of your customer ratings, and
your relationship with Yahoo! Merchants who pay to get better listings in
Yahoo! Shopping than results from the Web crawl. Merchants are ranked by a
ratings system that favors merchants who have given good service and have
been positively rated.
 Froogle: Froogle is Google’s shopping search engine and Google’s answer
to Yahoo! Shopping. Getting your products in Froogle is pretty easy when
you’re a Yahoo! Store because Froogle uses the XML feed from all Yahoo!
Stores. You can also submit your products in a datafeed via FTP, which
allows you to optimize your product listings. See https://www.google.
com/froogle/merchants for Froogle for merchants. (Google makes
money from advertising off of the Google AdWords that run alongside the
free product listings. See Chapter 18 for more on Google AdWords.)
 Feed Services: Some companies take your Yahoo! Store product data,
chop it up, reformat it, and submit it to all the different shopping
engines for a fee. My favorite would have to be Don Cole’s feed service
(www.ystoretools.com), which I talk about a bit more in Chapter 25.
Buying Text-Link Ads for Traffic
and Link Popularity
By now, you probably know you need to get links to your Yahoo! Store to get
traffic as well as the SEO benefits. One way to get links is to buy them. An easy
way to buy links is to hook up with text-link brokers like Text-Link-Ads.com.
Make buying text links another part of a real link-building campaign, which is
anything you do to get folks to link back to you. Request links from quality
content sites, directories, your own suppliers’ and manufacturers’ Web sites,
industry associations you belong to, and any other sites related to your
industry that will link to you. See Chapter 19 for more on the power of links
and link building.
Here are a few tips for buying text links:
 Buy text links on sites with a similar theme to your Yahoo! Store. You
want to benefit from the additional traffic that you’d get from that site,
regardless of any search engine optimization benefits. For example, if
you have an online pet store, buy text links on sites that have articles
about pets, not automotive shop sites.
279
Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts

 Buy links not only to your home page, but also deep links (links to
interior pages of your store) as well. Make sure that you use different
keywords in the anchor text (the text in the link).
 Don’t buy run-of-site links (links on every page) on huge 100,000-page
sites. After a few dozen pages, you quickly reach a point of diminishing
returns. Including 100,000 links from a single site looks like spam to most
search engines.
I’ve got a general rule that I use for budgeting funds for buying text links.
I take 10 percent of what I’m spending on paid-search ads, and I use that
number as my text-link budget.
Sponsoring Forums, Directories,
Nonprofits, and Clubs
Odds are that most of the affinity sites, hobby sites, interest sites, or commu-
nity sites similar to your Yahoo! Store niche sell advertising (links or banners)
or have sponsorship opportunities. Some sites, especially nonprofits, don’t
want to look like they’re out for the money, so you see the word sponsorship
used, but it really means the same thing: advertising.
If these sites don’t currently accept advertising, you can always suggest that
they do. Contact the owner or Webmaster and ask about sponsoring the site,
underwriting the site’s hosting expenses, or donating prizes for events or
contests in exchange for some marketing attention. All sponsoring a site
means is that you give the site money, and it gives you exposure (with ads,
links, mentions in their newsletters, and so on).
Many sites related to what you sell have forums or bulletin boards that are
teeming with potential customers. By sharing your expertise, lending a helping
hand, answering beginner questions, and participating in discussions in an
online community, you can build your reputation in the industry as an expert,
which lends credibility to your store. Make sure that you always abide by
forum rules and posting guidelines and really participate. Forums can be fun!
Commissioning Sales through
Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate programs are marketing relationships between retailers and Web sites.
Affiliates send traffic to the retailer’s Yahoo! Store in exchange for a percentage
of sales. Retailers provide sales copy, product databases, advertising graphics,
280
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

and banners for the affiliates to advertise their stores. These ads have links
that use a tracking code and go through a third-party like Commission Junction
(www.cj.com). Commission Junction’s tracking software keeps up with which
affiliate sent the retailer the traffic, and when someone buys something, the
affiliate gets credit for the sale.
Affiliate marketing has its upsides:
 You can get a ton of traffic very quickly.
 Merchants pay only when someone buys something.
 Merchants don’t pay for phone orders, newsletter signups who convert
later, people who surf at work but buy at home, or users who delete
their cookies. (Sometimes there are sales affiliates should get paid for,
but they don’t because their sales don’t track.)
Commission Junction is the only Yahoo! Store–approved affiliate solution. CJ
is a little expensive, but the interface is great, and CJ’s people know affiliate
marketing. Last time I talked with CJ, it had a one-year minimum commit-
ment, which ran about $5,000.
CJ gives you an independent third party to connect you with the affiliates (it
calls them publishers). You have an interface where you watch your stats,
upload your ads, and promote your program. Once a month, you pay CJ. CJ
pays your affiliates and charges you a fee of 30 percent of whatever you pay
your affiliates. For example, if you have a $100 sale where you pay your affiliate
10 percent, you pay 13 percent to CJ and CJ pays 10 percent to your affiliate.
One of the most successful marketing methods I’ve seen has been revenue
share programs. These deals are much like affiliate programs, but you usually
have a single affiliate dealing with a single Yahoo! Store.
In this model, the marketer gets a percentage of sales for designing, develop-
ing, improving, and maintaining a store, in addition to driving search-engine
traffic though search engine optimization and paid search. If the store doesn’t
sell anything, the marketer goes hungry, so you usually have an extremely
motivated search-engine marketer. If the store does sell something, the mar-
keter participates in the success of the store. This model allows the retailer to
concentrate on retailing and the marketer to concentrate on driving qualified
traffic to the online store.
Exploring eBay Auctions for Yahoo!
Store Owners
Auctions are a great way to sell things when you’re not selling products at full
retail or when you have samples or other products you want to liquidate.
281
Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts

Factory seconds, returned products, overstocks, and scratch-and-dent prod-
ucts make good auctions. While other auctions sites exist, eBay is about it
unless your industry has a niche auction site with a lot of activity.

Blogging for Retailers
I have to admit that I got caught up in the blogging phenomenon in the last 18
months. A blog (short for weblog) is a loose-format online journal where you
can write about almost anything. Blogs can address almost any subject, but
industry-specific blogs do well as marketing tools. Blogs are a lot less formal
than most corporate communications, so they allow you to present a more
personal face to your customers and vendors.
My Yahoo! Store Blog (http://ystore.blogs.com) started out as an
archive of some marketing columns I had written and turned into a soapbox
where I could rant and rave about various Yahoo! Store issues, and list tips
and tricks or marketing resources as I ran across them. I knew my clients, my
fellow developers, and even my friends at Yahoo! corporate headquarters
could read my posts.
Use blogs to feature new products and services, demonstrate your expert
knowledge about what you sell, and leverage all the content you’ve written in
e-mails and other places to a much larger audience. 
Sometimes blogging really pays off:
 Get access to opportunities in your industry. My acquisitions editor,
Steve Hayes, read my 100-plus blog posts (http://ystore.blogs.
com), which ultimately led to me writing this book. Had he only read
what was on my regular Web site trying to sell my marketing services, 
I may never have gotten the phone call that resulted in this book.
 Network over the Internet. I live in rural Mississippi, okay, which means
I never run into my dot-com peers down at the tractor pull. (Okay, I’ve
never really been to a tractor pull.) Frequent blog posts about my
obsession with converting keywords got me in on the beta test of
Swivel’s (www.swivel.com) cool new online marketing tool that tracks
and graphs your online advertising spending and conversion data with
an intuitive, visual interface. Participating in the beta test gave me input
on product development, which I never would have gotten otherwise.
282
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

 Tap into unknown customer needs. I wrote a blog post just the other
day about a company called SLI Systems (www.sli-systems.com),
which offers a Yahoo! Store–friendly customized search solution. While
somewhat expensive, the search is light-years ahead of the free-search
tool included in Yahoo!. Now I have multiple clients asking me to set up
custom searches for them. I had no idea my clients would be interested
in something like this, but one blog post, and wham!
Exploring Other Ways to Get Traffic
You can market your business and sell online in many ways. Realize that I
hyperfocus on two or three (SEO, paid search, and blogging) because they
work really well for me. Each client of mine has a unique approach to selling
online. I guess you just have to keep looking until you find what works for
you. Here are some other marketing avenues you should pursue:
 Swap links with related sites. Become a resource yourself with links
and reviews to the best content so that your customers come back to
your site even when they’re not specifically looking to buy something.
 Collect e-mail addresses and create weekly e-mail newsletters with spe-
cials. Have contests to collect some e-mail addresses and get folks excited
about your site. Run a survey or offer an online quiz to your readers.
 Write interesting articles and offer them to other sites. Give your visi-
tors this free content in exchange for an e-mail address. For example,
think about something like a “Buyer’s Guide: Ten Things You Should
Know Before Buying Anything.”
 Advertise offline. Trade journals and industry publications have cheap
classified ads. Consider radio, TV, billboards, direct mail, and catalogs.
The list is practically endless.

Peeling One Potato at a Time . . .
You can easily get overwhelmed with all the things you have to do. My dad
had a saying that probably has saved my sanity: “Peel one potato at a time.
You can only do one thing.” But how do you pick which thing to do? My Uncle
Paul always tells me to make sure that whatever you’re doing is the highest
priority and best use of your time.
283
Chapter 17: Driving Traffic That Converts

The secret weapon for prioritizing my work is to apply the 80/20 rule to
everything I do. Also known as the Pareto Principle, the 80/20 rule is simply
the observation that not all customers, products, or activities are created
equal and that the results you get from similar activities may vary widely.
If you focus on what activities get the most results, instead of trying to work
on everything, you’ll go much farther, much faster.
For example, 20 percent of your customers may generate 80 percent of your
revenues, 20 percent of your products can make up 80 percent of your sales,
and 20 percent of your keywords may generate 80 percent of your traffic and
conversions. After you know what the most effective 20 percent are, you can
concentrate more of your time and effort on those items and get a huge boost
in productivity.
For example, when you work on improving your product pages, start with your
bestsellers and work your way down the list in order of descending sales. By
the time you stop or run out of time, or something catches on fire, odds are
you’ve done the most important work. If you have a site with thousands of
products, odds are that most of your sales come from your top 100 items. If
you work alphabetically, you could optimize hundreds of pages before getting
to any of your bestsellers, which is probably not the best use of your time.
The 80/20 rule applies to many things, including marketing to your customers,
schmoozing with your vendors/suppliers, managing your PPC accounts, work-
ing on your SEO campaigns, maximizing products sales, writing buyer’s guides,
managing your keywords, grooming your employees, and so on.

S
earch ads are a fast and effective way to drive extremely targeted, qualified
Web traffic straight to your store. Your ads are shown only to potential
customers because you get to choose the keyword phrases that trigger your
ads. Open an advertising account, pick your search terms, write your ad copy,
set your budget, and off you go. You decide how much you can afford to pay
per visitor, and you budget your advertising up and down as needed.
Paid-search advertising works, too, and you can prove it with conversion-
tracking software. You can track almost everything, so throw money at what’s
generating sales while culling the losers. You have total control over where
you send the person who clicks your ad, too, so you can make sure that poten-
tial buyers land on the most relevant page on your site for their search query.
In this chapter, I give you a quick overview on how to cost-effectively use
pay-per-click advertising to help push up your sales in your Yahoo! Store, and
I tell you everything you need to know to improve your pay-per-click perfor-
mance. You find out how to track your visitors, create a winning landing page,
fine-tune your campaigns, and more.
Introducing Paid-Search Advertising
The search engines have finally figured out how to make a buck or two.
Scratch that. More like ten billion. Analysts estimate global spending on paid

search was close to $10,000,000,000.00 in 2005. The search-engine advertising
business is on fire, growing at a whopping 40 percent-plus a year. Holy cow.
And I’m supposed to cover all you need to know in less than 20 pages?
Paid search, sometimes called pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, is the advertis-
ing part of search-engine marketing. Paid-search ads usually appear at the
top or right of a search engine’s free results page, triggered by keyword
searches. Only ads relevant to the specific keyword-phrase search display
alongside the search engine’s regular or free results. Here’s how you buy into
paid-search advertising:
1. Open a search-marketing account.
Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing are the ones you want,
and all you need is a credit card. Check out the promotional offers
page at http://sbs.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/marketing/
promotional_offers.php with a $50 promotional credit available
for folks opening new accounts with Y!SM and Google AdWords. The
paid-search companies are always giving away coupons at all the search
conferences I attend, so hit me up for some freebies, too!
2. Select keywords relevant to your business.
See Chapter 16 for more than you want to know about choosing keywords.
3. Write search listings ads with titles and descriptions.
Describe the benefits of doing business with you — the less hype, the
better. Read about writing effective search ads in the section “Creating
clickable ads,” later in this chapter.
4. Determine how much you want to bid for each search term.
You control your ad’s position by how much you bid compared to your
competitors. Discover bidding strategies in the section “Bidding smart
from the start,” later in this chapter.
5. Pick the most relevant landing page.
Each keyword phrase and search ad should point to the one page on
your site that solves that specific customer’s problem. Sometimes every
keyword needs a separate page. Read about landing pages in the section
“Coming in for a landing,” later in this chapter.
6. Submit your ads and cross your fingers.
Your ads must pass Google’s or Yahoo!’s editorial review to make sure
that the words you buy are relevant to your landing page. When
approved, your ads start to appear across the ad network and, if you
choose, on content sites as well. Read all about the network and differ-
ent distribution options in the section “Choosing syndication and distri-
bution options,” later in this chapter.
286

7. Track what works (and what doesn’t) with free conversion-tracking
software.
Monitor your ads. Test different keywords, ad copy, and landing pages.
Start cramming on improving your search-ad campaigns in the section
“Measuring Search-Advertising Results,” later in this chapter.
Deciding between Paid
and Free Searches
The instantaneous gratification of pay-per-click ads can be tempting. Here’s
where paying to get listed in the top results beats hoping to be listed in the
free results:
 With paid search, you’re totally in control. You choose the keywords,
write the ads, and pick which pages get promoted. With SEO, the search
engines (and sometimes the spammers) are in control of the rankings.
 With paid search, your ads appear almost immediately. You don’t have
to wait weeks or months for your site to appear in paid-search ads like
you do in the free search results.
 With paid search, you’re not at the mercy of search-engine spiders
and ranking algorithms to determine the most relevant page. Just get
out your wallet and buy your way to the top, because (like in the real
world) the highest bidder gets the best real estate.
 With paid search, you choose what keyword phrases you rank well
for by how much you’re willing to pay. Free search-engine rankings for
keywords sometimes seem almost random, even though you optimize
for your best words. For example, my #1 referring keyword phrase from
Google on my dog-supply site is Dog Boots, but we sell only two kinds of
dog boots and have around 1,500 other kinds of products. Go figure.
 With paid search, you can test keyword phrases that you don’t rank
well for in the free results. That way, you can see whether you want to
optimize for those words, too. Sometimes very competitive or expensive
keywords don’t convert like you think they should.
 With paid search, you also write the ads so that you determine what
users see. You choose the link text (title) and the little snippet of text
(description) that appear on the search results pages. With the free 
listings, you have little or no control over what the search engines 
display.
287
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top

 With paid search, you also choose what pages folks land on for each
keyword. Instead of hoping that your best landing pages rank for your
best keywords, you get to pick where folks go on your Web store. You
can also change your landing pages as often as you want to maximize
their effectiveness. When your pages rank really well for your best
keywords in the free search results, you’re almost afraid to touch
the pages.
Unfortunately, paid search has a dark side as well:
 Paid-search advertising is expensive and consumes a lot of time.
Babysitting your ad campaigns takes a lot of time and mental energy. If
you don’t closely monitor your campaigns, a good campaign can go
down the tubes fast.
 Customers trust the free, natural, organic results. Free results are seen
as independent and more authoritative than ads. More sophisticated
surfers seem to avoid clicking ads.
 Competitors can be foolish and bid insane amounts, thus temporarily
making your search-ad campaign ineffective or unprofitable.
Competitors can also click your ads. Click fraud can be costly and
frustrating.
 More retailers lose money than make money on pay-per-click ad cam-
paigns (in my experience). This loss is probably due more to ego-
bidding, mismanagement, or neglect than from evil-doers.
 Keywords just keep getting more and more expensive! The average
cost per click just keeps going up. Two or three years ago, most traffic
was free. You can still get thousands of people per day to your Web site
at no cost-per-click with good old-fashioned SEO. There’s nothing like
free traffic from search engines. Develop some good unique content, get
a ton of links, and that’s pretty much it.
Combining the one-two punch
of SEO and PPC
Truth be told, ’round here we like both kinds of search marketing: paid and
free. Search marketing is the one-two punch of search engine optimization
(SEO) + paid search, which can be an effective match to your SEO campaigns.
Free search is not enough. According to an iProspect study in May 2004
(IProspect, Search Engine User Attitudes, 5/2004), almost 40 percent of the
traffic from the Big Four portals comes from PPC ads.
288
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

I believe you should buy paid-search (PPC) ads when you already rank well
for your keyword terms in the free results from your search engine optimiza-
tion (SEO) strategy. When do you normally get two chances to make an adver-
tising impression with a prospect who is ready to buy? It’s like buying an ad
in the newspaper that runs right next to your feature story. You can’t control
what they write about you, but the ad is all yours!
Planning Your PPC Ad Campaign
You need to start any advertising campaign with a good plan. Before you
start shelling out greenbacks to Google and Yahoo!, ask yourself the following
questions to determine the best way to spend your ad dollars:
 What are my store’s PPC goals? Decide what you want prospects to do
when they come to your store. Usually the primary goal is to get
browsers to turn into buyers by placing an order. Secondary goals
include signing up for a newsletter or downloading a buyer’s guide.
 How much is this campaign worth to my business? Take time to figure
out how much you’re willing to pay for an order. I give you an equation
to follow in the section “Knowing what to bid,” later in this chapter,
that can help you determine this amount. You also need to decide how
much you’re willing to pay per customer, as well as the lifetime value of
a customer.
 What are my store’s numbers? Determine your store’s conversion rate.
Conversion rate is the percentage of unique visitors that actually buys
something. You can figure this rate by dividing the number of orders by
the number of unique visitors. Next, figure your gross profit margin (your
retail price minus the cost of the goods sold) and the amount of your
average order.
 What is my store’s budget? Determine your initial monthly budget for
PPC advertising, how much time you can spend managing your PPC
campaigns, and, for every dollar you spend, the amount of sales you
have to generate to make a profit.
Buying Traffic with Paid-Search Ads
The paid-search advertising networks — for example, Yahoo! Search
Marketing and Google AdWords — serve ads on hundreds of Web sites and
give you access to millions of searchers each day, and they want to rent them
to you for mere pennies a click. If you want to guarantee that your company
289
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top

shows up on the first page of search-engine results, get your wallet out
because it’s time to buy some ads. The good news is that you incur little or
no upfront costs, make no commitment whatsoever, and you pay nothing if
no one clicks your ads.
Picking keywords
The keyword phrase is the word or words that someone types into a search
engine. When the user clicks the Search button, that search phrase triggers
both free results and paid ads (sponsored links). Before investing in a PPC
campaign, you need to know exactly what keyword phrases your customers
use when they’re looking to buy what you sell because these converting key-
words are the words you’ll bid on for your ads to appear on Yahoo! and Google.
You can determine the best keywords for your business in a number of ways.
Did a keyword phrase convert into a sale? Did a keyword phrase generate
traffic to your Web site? Are your competitors buying that keyword phrase or
optimizing their Web site for that keyword phrase? For more information
about keywords than you’ll probably ever want to know, see Chapter 16.
Deciding on matching types
When you advertise on a keyword, you also choose how specific the keyword
matching is. One major difference between Google and Y!SM is default match-
ing type. With Google, you get broad match by default. Overture’s standard
match (default) displays your ads for exact matches to your search terms, as
well as singular/plural variations, common misspellings, and “topics that are
highly relevant to your keywords, titles and descriptions.”
Here are your matching choices:
 Broad match (or standard match) shows your ad on every search con-
taining your keywords in any order.
 Phrase match shows your ad only on searches containing your exact
phrase.
 Exact match shows your ad only for searches that contain that exact
keyword phrase.
Eliminate keywords you don’t want with negative matching
Negative matching allows you to pick stop words that kill your ad for any
searches containing that term, because sometimes you don’t want to be
found for certain keywords phrases. Usually, these negative keywords are
either very popular searches that don’t match your business model (free,
cheap, wholesale, downloads, samples, and so on) or phrases where your key-
words overlap with phrases in other unrelated industries.
290
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Buying your company name and domain
One way to improve performance is to buy your company name and URL.
This strategy may seem a bit obvious, but no one does it. You probably already
rank very well for your domain name and your company name, but buy them
anyway. When someone is searching for me, I want to make sure that I’m found.
Buy every possible variant of how someone could search for your company
name. Buy misspellings of your name. Buy your name as all one word. Buy
every variant of your domain name. Buy the singular and plurals of your
name. Buy your e-mail addresses. Watch for other ways folks butcher your
name and buy those variants, too.
Creating clickable ads
Keywords are only one part of a PPC campaign. You also need to write an
actual advertisement to appear along with the keyword. After I assemble my
list of keywords, I start out writing ads for each bucket of keywords.
 Headline/Title: The headline or title is the blue underlined link that folks
click to go to your Web site. Google AdWords gives you up to 25 charac-
ters. Yahoo! Search Marketing limits you to 40 characters in titles.
A headline is the most important marketing copy you’ll ever write. I have
better results when the title of the ad is exactly what folks are searching
for. I try to include something to make the title/headline relevant.
 Description: The description is the ad text that appears after your link.
Yahoo! Search Marketing gives you 190 characters in your caption, but
some search partners show an abbreviated listing with only 70 characters.
Make sure that your description makes sense with only 70 characters.
With a Yahoo! Search Marketing ad, you can actually write a more
descriptive sentence than with a Google ad because Google gives you
only two lines with a maximum of 35 characters on each line, which can
be a little frustrating. After you get the hang of writing concisely, creat-
ing Google ads can be fun, almost like writing a marketing haiku.
 URL: Your paid-search ad also has a URL, which is the address of a page
on your site where you want to send visitors who clicked on that spe-
cific ad. Every ad could have a unique URL to a unique landing page
designed especially for that ad. Both Yahoo! Search Marketing and
Google AdWords give you 1,024 characters for your URL so that you
have plenty of room for long page names and tracking codes. Y!SM dis-
plays only your domain name.
 Display URL: Google AdWords also gives you an additional field called
Display URL with a maximum length of 35 characters. Name your landing
page with your keywords or ad copy so that you can call additional
attention to your AdWords ad. Make your Display URL something like
http://domain.com/keyword-phrase-sale.html.
291
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top

Coming in for a landing
Usually, when someone clicks one of my ads, I either send them to the front
page (rarely), a section page (uncommon), a product page (more often), or a
search results pages from my Yahoo! Store’s internal search engine.
Lazy marketers land folks on the home page. Sometimes that’s appropriate
for the most generic words. People can discover what your company is about
and poke around your site, but you can usually choose a more relevant page
depending upon the search word.
If folks are looking for information about various product groups using more
generic keyword phrases such as Plasma HDTV or Automatic Swimming Pool
Cleaners, I like to send them to my Product Buyer’s Guides. Section pages are
also good places for these folks to land on your site, but I usually link to the
sections from the Buyer’s Guides. Product-related keywords definitely need
to use product pages as landing pages.
Here are a few more tips about landing pages:
 If you have to think for more than two seconds about where you want a
prospect to land on your site, then you know that you need to create a
specific landing page for that keyword phrase.
 Check to make sure that your landing pages are up, especially if you have
multiple people working on your Web site. There’s nothing like paying for
terms that have a 404 error page when folks click on a $5-a-click ad.
 If you’re targeting very specific terms, consider making a landing page
template without normal site navigation, but experiment with different
types of landing pages to see which types of pages get you a better con-
version rate.
 Use the search term in the headline of your landing page. I always try to
get the “Hey! That’s exactly what I was looking for!” response.
 Talk about the benefits of buying the product in the first screen shot of
the landing page. Tell your reader what problem this product solves.
Bullet points are great for pointing out features and benefits.
Determining bid amounts
The bid amount is how much money an advertiser is willing to pay for some-
one to click his ad and go to his Web site. They’re called pay-per-click ads
because an advertiser only has to pay when users click the ad. You don’t
have to pay for impressions (the number of times your ad is shown), only for
clicks on your ad.
292
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Y!SM has a very straightforward auction where the highest bidder gets the
highest number position. Google is a little different and rewards advertisers
with ads that generate the most revenue with better positions. Let me explain.
For example, imagine if you will, one advertiser bidding $1.00 a click for a cer-
tain keyword phrase, and getting a 1% click-through rate, or CTR, on the ad.
Google makes $1.00 for every 100 people seeing the ad. Imagine a second
advertiser bidding a little more than half as much, say only 51 cents a click,
but this second advertiser had a 2 percent CTR (perhaps because she had a
better written ad). Google would make $1.02 per 100 visitors because of the
higher CTR and reward the second advertiser with the #1 position.
Bidding smart from the start
When planning a PPC advertising campaign, an important early step is deter-
mining how much you can spend per click. When you set up an advertising
account, you set the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for a visitor for
each search term. You can change these bids at any time, and you can pause
your ad campaign with the click of a button. However, you need to have some
general ideas of how much you can pay for an average sale to set a baseline
for building a profitable campaign. When you have some real conversion
data, it’s easier to pay a lot more for the big fish and ignore the minnows and
the snapping turtles.
There’s a very delicate balance between bidding high enough to be well-
ranked in the paid-search results and converting enough of those shoppers
into buyers to make sure that your advertising makes money.
293
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top
Looking at bids with the View Bids tool on Y!SM
Yahoo! Search Marketing will show you adver-
tisers’ maximum bids at any given time. To view
them, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.overture.com and do a

research.
2. In the upper-right corner, click the View
Advertisers’ Max Bids link.
A screen appears, asking you to type the
search term again and a random code word.
3. Type the term and random code word.
The maximum that all the current advertis-

My good friend, David Karandish of FindStuff.com (who some folks will recog-
nize as the SEO on Martha Stewart’s Apprentice), gave me this advice about
bid throttling — the process of bidding much higher in the short term than
you’re willing to pay in the long term — and how it’s fundamental for estab-
lishing a click-through rate on new AdWords campaigns:
Google’s advertising revenue is maximized by getting more and more clicks.
It is in their best interest to show ads that get clicked on as often as possible.
New advertisers must bid significantly higher to get activated in order to
establish a click-through history. Once a track record is established, you can
slowly throttle down (lower) your bids and maintain better positioning for a
much cheaper cost per click.
Knowing what to bid
You need a pretty good idea of the most you can spend per visitor before you
get started. After a campaign gets going, you can then optimize different key-
words with different bid amounts, but you need to know your numbers for an
average visitor to your Yahoo! Store.
Are you advertising products that tend to generate repeat orders? Take this
factor into account when deciding how much you can afford to pay for that
first sale. Raise your maximum cost-per-order (CPO) for ads for products that
create repeat buyers.
Remember that customers from PPC convert at somewhat different rates
than free traffic, and all keywords convert at wildly different rates, so aim to
beat your averages. Some ads and keyword phrases perform better, and some
perform worse. You can adjust individual keywords and bids accordingly as
you develop your campaigns.
Getting the best bids for your bucks
The top spots above the free search results on a search engine are called the
premium listings. These listings are the same as the text ads that run down
the right side of the page. If you want your ad to go to the top — or even
appear at all — you have to pay premium dollars. Some of Google’s and
Y!SM’s partners only use the top three or four bids.
If you’re in the #1 spot, you can expect about a 10 percent click-through rate
(CTR), which means you get 1 click per 10 impressions. A #2 position gener-
ates somewhere around a 5 percent CTR and a #3 position around 4 percent,
and the amount of clicks you get drops almost exponentially as your position
decreases.
To get premium positioning on Google, you also have to pass an editorial
review where someone at Google performs a hand-check on your ad to make
sure that your ads are relevant to the search term. After you get your ads to
294
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

the top, if you have strong bids with high click-through rates, it’s somewhat
difficult to get knocked off by a competitor unless he’s willing to bid two to
five times what you’re paying.
So is it worth it to be the #1 ad on a search engine? Actually, I’ve had better
luck in the #2 or #3 position, and the industry thinking seems to be along the
same lines. Sometimes the #1 position gets all the clickers who are just curi-
ous and don’t really read the ad. The #1 position also is vulnerable to com-
petitors who like to click other advertisers’ ads.
Choosing syndication and
distribution options
Right now, only two paid-search advertising networks really count: Yahoo!
Search Marketing (a.k.a. the ad network formerly known as Overture) and
Google AdWords. The Big Four Portals — Yahoo!, Google, MSN, and AOL —
and their affiliates drive 94 percent of all traffic (millions upon millions of visi-
tors) from search engines to Web sites.
Yahoo! and Google also syndicate their search ads across multiple search
partner sites, which run ads on their much smaller search engines or other
Web sites.
Content ads: PPC by any other name
Content partners are just like search partners, but instead of running search
ads on search-engine search queries, content partners display ads on top of
articles, using sophisticated spidering tools to read the content of a page and
then display relevant ads on top of that content.
In my experience, content ads do not convert at anywhere near the level of
search marketing ads because folks visiting those content sites aren’t
actively searching for information or looking to buy products, so you may be
burning through your valuable advertising dollars on content match ads
when you think all your dollars are being spent on paid search.
Setting different distribution options
Sometimes you want your ads to run in only certain cities, or states, or parts
of the world, or you want your ads to run everywhere except a particular
area. When you’re setting up a campaign, you usually have to indicate
295
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top

whether you want your ads to run in the United States and/or across the
entire world, but you have other options, too. Exploring the details of the var-
ious geographic ad distribution options may be for you if you only sell locally
or have certain limitations on your sales territory.
Measuring Search-Advertising Results
Conversion-tracking software allows you to see what ads drive tire-kickers
and what ads drive buyers. When you have this information, you can start
improving the efficacy of your paid-search campaigns. You can cull the non-
performing ads, tweak the underperforming ads, and study the overperform-
ing ads to see whether you can take the magic and sprinkle some of it back
on the rest of your campaign.
Here’s a conversion-tracking tip: When you start using conversion tracking,
put the start date in the campaign name. If you run conversion rate reports
where the date range overlaps the time before you were tracking conver-
sions, your data will be off because all the clicks you got before adding the
code look like they had 0 percent conversions.
Using free conversion tracking
Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing now offer free conversion-
tracking code, which shows you which campaigns, ads, and keywords are
turning into sales and which are turning your stomach. If you advertise on
both networks, you need both tracking codes.
Google conversion-rate tracking doesn’t count all Google partners, and it’s
likely that Y!SM has similar problems. You get what you pay for, and 100 per-
cent accuracy is impossible. I always use multiple tracking methods to be sure.
Getting your JavaScript tracking code from Google and Yahoo! Search
Marketing consoles is pretty straightforward, but if you have any problems,
just consult their Help pages. After you have one or both of the tracking
scripts, all you do is paste them inside the message field on your Order
Confirmation page. Here’s how:
1. Log in to your Yahoo! Store and click the Store Manager link.
The Store Manager page appears.
2. In the Order Settings column, click the Order Form link.
The Customize Your Order Form page appears.
296
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

3. Scroll down to the Order Confirmation section and paste your track-
ing code(s) inside the Message field.
4. Scroll to the top of the page and click the Done button.
You return to the Yahoo! Store Manager.
5. Click the Publish Order Settings link to publish your Google and/or
Y!SM tracking code.
Buying third-party tracking tools
If you spend more than $500 a month on PPC, you need Yahoo! Store–friendly
conversion-tracking software. You just put a little snippet of code in your
Head-tags field and on your Order Confirmation page, and these programs
track where visitors come from, what they search for, and what they do. You
can use tools, such as Clicktracks, Keywordmax, or Indextools that have
workarounds or hacks that actually do capture the amount of the sale. I like
all three programs and have used them on various projects. I talk more about
these products in Chapters 20 and 25.
Working with trackable links
The Store Manager’s Track Links feature is an easy way for Standard and Pro
accounts (sorry, Starter accounts!) to track sales from paid-search and other
campaigns so you can see which campaigns or banners or keywords are
working. Here’s how Track Links works:
Create a link with a descriptive name. The Store Manager then generates a URL
with a unique tracking code. You use that link as the URL in the ad you want to
track. When someone visits your site using this URL, the Store Manager makes
a note and redirects him to the normal URL for the landing page.
Go to the Store Manager’s Track Links page to see stats of the number of visi-
tors, number of orders, and sales per link within a day or so of user activity.
Orders from customers who clicked on Track Links are also marked with the
name of the link right on the order so you can see which campaigns are work-
ing as orders come in.
Here’s how to create a trackable link:
1. Log in to your Yahoo! Store and go to Store Manager.
2. Click the Create Links link.
The Manage Trackable Links page appears.
297
Chapter 18: Buying Your Way to the Top

3. In the blank field, type the name of the link.
Name your links with obvious names and as much information as possi-
ble so that you know which campaigns convert when you look at your
Track Link stats. I like names like “041305 Google AdWords, Campaign 2,
AdGroup 3, Ad 2” or “050506 Cocker Spaniel Keywords.”
4. Click the Create New Trackable Link button.
The Link page appears with your track-link URL, which includes your
account name, a random-looking unique alphanumeric code (uXEP5p),
and the name of the page you link to. For example, here’s a Track Link:
http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?YourAccountName+uXEP5p+index.html
Track Links point to the home page (index.html) by default, but you can
change the page name to whatever page you want to send clickers to by
replacing index.html with any other page name. For example, if you want
to track links to a landing page called buy-this-product.html, you’d use
something like this code as your URL in your PPC:
http://store.yahoo.com/cgi-bin/clink?youraccountname+MAyg4J+buy-this-product.html
After creating my trackable links, I usually place a test order to make sure
that everything is working. Just allow 24 to 48 hours for the stats to update.
Improving Your Campaigns
Running an ad campaign is about more than just coming up with winning key-
words and great landing pages. You have to maintain your campaign, just like
you would regularly do yard work to have a great yard. You need to get rid of
keywords that aren’t paying off and replace them.
Just to be absolutely sure that all my ads are working, I dig in and cull the
losers. I’m looking to pause or fix ads where I’m spending a lot of money to
get traffic that either doesn’t convert at all or where the cost-per-order is way
out of whack with what we make on an order.
Nonperforming keywords
Some keyword phrases do send me traffic but for some reason don’t convert
into sales. Eventually, I set a dollar threshold with the maximum amount of
money I think I can spend on a keyword phrase over a given period of time
without getting a conversion (usually $10 a phrase), and I pause or delete any
keywords above this threshold.
298
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Underperforming keywords
Another group of keywords are relevant to my site, get a lot of traffic and
clicks, and actually convert, but at an extremely low conversion rate. These
underperforming keywords make my cost-per-order (CPO) higher than my
profit per sale. Ouch. If my cost per order is, say, $20, based on what I’m get-
ting paid as a revenue share partner, I can’t afford to spend that. I can spend
more like $12 CPO. So I go and I cut off any ads that are more than $15 CPO in
a given time period, even though I know these words are relevant and convert.
I keep a list of words I removed from my PPC campaigns, and I check this list
from time to time to see whether any words should be added back to my
active campaigns. Sometimes I get inspired to see whether I can take an
underperforming word and make the perfect ad and landing page to make it
worth buying.

Discovering Search Engine
Optimization (SEO)
In This Chapter
 Discovering that search engine optimization is all about text and links
 Optimizing Yahoo! Stores in five easy steps
 Creating good content using assets you didn’t even think you had
 Getting links and winning bass tournaments
 Outsourcing SEO or doing it yourself
S
earch engine optimization (SEO) is sometimes looked upon as a mysteri-
ous, black art where you have to be a whacked-out mad scientist or an
idiot savant or mathematical genius to crack the secret algorithms of the
search engines to get free traffic. Nope! You’ve been watching too much TV.
For e-commerce folks like you and me, the best search engine optimization
strategy is a two-pronged strategy: make sure that the engines can tell exactly
what your site is about and get more links than the other guy.
A couple of my SEO friends think I expose way, way too much of my personal
search engine optimization methodology, but what the heck! Things change
so fast, and I’m not telling you everything I know! I do think you’ll get your $25
worth out of two specific pages in here. You find out the steps to successful
Yahoo! Store search engine optimization, including how to know what HTML
elements are missing from your store, assign keywords to pages, create com-
pelling title tags, master meta-tags, write search-engine-friendly copy, and
love links.
In this chapter, I really give you more strategy than specific tactics. The most
important thing to do is to make sure that the search engines know that your
site is really about what you say it’s about. And keep your nose clean,
because when you get busted, it hurts!

Discovering How Search Engines Work
When you do a search on a search engine like Google, Yahoo!, or MSN Search,
the search-engine server checks its index for pages that contain the words
matching your search query. This list of pages can literally be in the millions
of pages, depending on your keyword phrase. The search engine then quickly
sorts the pages to show you the most relevant listings at the top of the page.
And it does this process almost instantly!
Order, please!
The order of search results is determined by these super, super secret algo-
rithms (rules used to rank Web pages) and filters that are the secret behind
the billion dollar search-engine companies’ technology. If you knew exactly
how a search engine ranked pages, in theory you could jump to the #1 posi-
tion for almost any search keyword by building the perfect page. After play-
ing with search engines for almost ten years, I now think of all the different
algos and filters used to order search results kinda like a kaleidoscope where
something’s always changing. I guess it’s harder to hit a moving target!
Back in 1997, search engines used what today would be considered extremely
unsophisticated methods to rank Web pages, primarily using many different
on-page factors (elements on the page) in their ranking algorithms. For exam-
ple, keyword density (the percentage of the occurrence of a keyword compared
to the total text) was extremely important, so SEOs spent a lot of time looking
at pages that outranked them, measured their keyword density, and then
tweaked their pages to match. Keyword frequency, the number of times a key-
word appears in a given page, was somewhat important, too. Then everything
changed.
Enter Google
A little startup no one had ever heard of, called Google, started using a radi-
cal new idea to dramatically improve the relevancy of its search results. With
Google’s search engine, it didn’t really matter what you said about your site
with meta-tags or even keyword density because Google relied more on what
other sites said about you. Google performed reputation analysis on every
page in its index by looking at the quantity and quality of links from other
Web pages linking to a particular page. When more important pages linked to
your page, the more important your page was. Google founder Larry Page
called this ranking PageRank. Nowadays, all the big search engines do some
sort of link popularity and reputation analysis and figure these rankings in
their search algorithms.
302
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Along came a spider
Search engines use special software called spiders (or robots) to crawl the
Web looking for new pages to add to their index. The crawl starts from a data-
base of pages already in their index so that the ’bot can make sure that old
pages still exist, find and index changes to the old pages, and then follow any
new links to discover new Web pages.
If you ever want to see what your site looks like to a search-engine spider,
turn off images and JavaScript in your browser. All you see is text and links.
It’s pretty plain. Now you’re probably starting to see why text and links are
important to your search-engine rankings, because search engines can only
index and rank what they can see!
When you have a new site, you want the search engines to find your site —
and fast! The easiest way is to get links from sites already in the index. It’s
easy to find these indexed sites because they’re the ones that come up when
you do a keyword search. For example, the Yahoo! Directory is a great place
to buy a link ($299 a year if approved) because spiders crawl all over Yahoo!’s
directory. See Chapter 17 for more on the Yahoo! Directory and other places
to get links.
After the ’bot finds your site, it crawls (visits) all your pages. The search-
engine spider indexes the text on your pages and counts and follows links on
your site. After your pages get indexed, you start to get a trickle of traffic to
your site when folks search for phrases relevant to your site. The more links
you get and the more relevant the text on your site, the more traffic you get.
Honestly, all that search-engine math makes my head hurt. I was an art major!
I just find what works for ranking my sites, and I keep doing that until it
doesn’t work anymore. My best secret weapon is my really, really smart
friends who I roll with at search-engine conferences all around the country.
Speaking of SEO buddies, SEOMike, whose real name is Mike Black, president
of Internet Marketing Resources (www.im-resources.com), took a gander
at the fourth or fifth version of this chapter and reminded me to plug some-
thing new. Google has a great way to allow you to help its spider find all your
pages: Google Sitemaps.
Google offers free tools to help you create an XML file for Google’s robot,
which tells it what pages you want indexed, how frequently you want them
indexed, and what new pages you have added. Google also provides you with
spidering reports that you can view from your Google account. These reports
tell you whether the Googlebot is having any problems with your pages, which
makes me sleep better at night. Visit www.google.com/sitemaps/login for
more information.

Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Uh, is this spam?
Don’t do anything you know you’re not supposed to do because search
engines detect spam. Don’t try to deceive the search engines. Don’t link to
spammy sites. Don’t do anything you don’t want your competitors reporting
on a search-engine spam report.
I e-mail a couple of SEO friends of mine every week or so with examples of
sites aggressively marketing their products online, and I always use the same
subject line “Uh, is this spam?” Good friend Joe Morin of BoostRanking.com,
SEO to the CEOs, always replies with some variation of “Cousin, if you have
to ask, then you know it’s spam!” I know, cousin. I know.

examples of search-engine spam on his personal Web site, www.mattcutts.

on the cheap.
Appreciating Yahoo! Stores
for Ease of SEO
Yahoo! Stores are search-engine friendly from the get-go with no custom pro-
gramming required. I’ve sold millions of dollars over the years with Yahoo!
Stores using the standard, built-in RTML templates, even though I make some
pretty serious RTML tweaks these days. Here’s why Yahoo! Stores work well
for free search-engine traffic:
 Store Editor–built pages are static HTML pages that are very search-
engine friendly. Static means that they sit in a folder on a Yahoo!
server somewhere and are much better for search engines than
dynamic (database-generated) pages. Dynamic pages are used by
most other e-commerce packages because dynamic pages don’t exist
until someone asks for them by clicking a link or doing a product search.
 Yahoo! Store pages are easy to edit, so making SEO improvements is
very easy. Anytime you’re editing your store — for example, making
price changes — you can also make tweaks to the various SEO elements.
 Yahoo! servers have an extremely high uptime, which is critical for
searchbots. If your site isn’t there when the search engine spider or ’bot
shows up, the ’bot assumes that you most likely deleted the pages and
removes them from the index. Ouch! “No, wait! Come back, Googlebot! I
was in the shower. . . .”
304

Optimizing Yahoo! Stores
without Programming
The secret to the Yahoo! Store standard template SEO is pretty simple:
 Put your keywords at least once in the Name field, and at least twice in
the Caption field on all product and section pages using normal language
to accurately describe your products.
 Link to up to 25 of your big-money section and product pages in the
Variables Final-text field. Use the most important keywords for the
anchor text (words in the links).
 Use the Abstract fields on section pages and the home page.
I also recommend that you go a little bit overboard in the link development
category if you don’t spring for custom RTML. A decently optimized page
with tons of links to it beats a perfectly optimized page with fewer links
every time.
Optimizing Your Store for Search Engines
Okay. Here’s how I do SEO. If you’re a competitor of any of my clients, this is
really just a filler chapter, and none of this stuff works, anyway. Go check out
Chapter 13. Serious, professional Yahoo! Store search engine optimization
consists of five parts: custom RTML programming, keyword research, SEO
copywriting, link development, and tracking results. This process is cyclical;
as you add more content and expand what products you sell, your keywords
grow and change over time.
Custom RTML programming
Custom SEO RTML templates are sexy! Make structural changes to your
RTML templates to make your already SEO-friendly Yahoo! Store into a search
engine’s dream date. It’s like building the perfect, uh, page. After this new
RTML framework is built, most of the thinking work still has to be done, but
now you have a place to put everything. It’s like getting a new house with
tons of storage space! Now pay your RTML guys, kick ’em out of the store,
and get to work on the keywords.
305
Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Disclaimer: The “custom RTML” part is optional (see Chapter 26), because
you really can optimize Yahoo! Stores right out of the box and do fine in the
search engines. You may have to override several variables on every page,
which is a major pain, but you can do it. RTML programming isn’t for every-
one, and not everyone has the couple of thousand dollars or so needed to
hire the right programmers to make the right SEO templates for your store.
I’ll let you in on a little secret: If you get only one extra order a day from
super SEO RTML templates (and you should!), the extra orders you get within
the first year will more than pay for the couple of thousand bucks you need
to spend to get your templates done right. Plus, think of all the time you’ll
save by not having to override variables every time you make a new page! For
more on RTML, see Chapter 26.
Here’s what I do with my RTML tweaks. You can use this checklist when you
complete your custom templates:
 Replace or supplement the built-in image-based Nav-bar buttons. Add
text-link navigation, navigational text breadcrumbs, sidebars with text
links, and text link footers to the pages. I think I see a trend here. . . .
 Add certain missing SEO elements to the templates for custom title,
meta descriptions, and meta keyword tags. Create custom fields on
each page to store this info or use existing fields, such as Label and
Abstract, for other purposes.
 Replace images with text wherever possible. For example, replace the
part of the template that generates Headlines as image files (pictures of
pretty fonts) with more search-engine-friendly <H1> heading tags around
the text in your Headline or Name field.
 Create separate RTML templates for product pages. I like products to
have a more conversion-oriented focus. Section and content pages are
more about navigation and education.
 Separate products from sections. Stores with more than seven or eight
major sections, or sections with 100-plus products, need a separate
RTML category template for each major section complete with section-
specific navigation (to related subsections and products).
Keyword research
Keyword research is so important. You need a list of your top 200 keywords,
which you then assign to about 40 or 50 pages. Every optimized page needs
four or five keywords and phrases assigned to it. See Chapter 16 for more on
keywords.
306
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Different types of pages have different types of keywords assigned to them.
For example, product pages are better for model numbers, specific brand
names, and singular versions of words. Section pages are better for some-
what more generic keywords and plurals. Home pages are better for really
broad phrases.
One of the best ways to figure out which keywords match up with a page is to
ask yourself what the searcher is trying to find and see which page is most
relevant. You can see how well your site is optimized by doing the same
query on Google or Yahoo! with a site: filter. For example, if the keyword
phrase for Big Ed’s WidgetWorld.com is “Widget 2000 replacement parts,” I
do a search (without quotes) for:
site:WidgetWorld.com widget 2000 replacement parts
The search engine then returns only results from WidgetWorld.com containing
the words widget and 2000 and replacement and parts. From this example
alone, you can see the words you need to add to your section and product
pages.
Honestly, you could do nothing else for SEO besides adding the words buyers
use to find your site to the pages relevant to those keywords, and your site
would rank better and better. It’s virtually impossible to rank for words not
on your site (unless someone links to your pages with those words, or the
search engines start using synonym matching in their algorithms).
Someone needs to figure out your most valuable keywords. I prefer to use my
converting keywords for my top 200 keywords, rather than the more generic
words that drive traffic but don’t convert into sales. See Chapter 16 for the
secrets to unlocking keywords.
SEO copywriting
SEO copywriting starts after you’ve assigned the four or five page keywords
to each page. Write a page title and a two- to three-sentence description.
Then expand the page keywords list to 15 to 20 keyword phrases. Make sure
your product description uses your keywords in a compelling Caption that
sells your product.
Here are the different elements you need to write:
 Title: Every page needs a compelling title tag (anywhere from 6 to
12 words) that describes the page with the most valuable keywords
used in it.
307
Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

 Description: You need to write a 15- to 25-word abstract that sums up
the page using all the page keywords in a couple or three sentences
for the meta description.
 Keywords: Expand your page keywords to a total of anywhere from 12
to 18 keyword phrases (including singulars and plurals, misspellings,
alternate spellings, related words, and so on) for the meta keyword list.
 Caption: Make sure that the four or five page keywords are used on the
page itself within the Caption field. Sometimes you can use the copy you
wrote for the Abstract for the first paragraph of the Caption.
 Internal links: Make sure that you link to this page from other pages on
your site using these keywords in the link text (anchor text). For exam-
ple, link to your replacement parts page with the anchor text Widget
2000 replacement parts from as many different pages as make sense.
Writing descriptive product names for title tags
Page titles (or titles or title tags) should describe the content of a Web page
in a compelling and informative sentence filled with relevant keywords. For
example, consider a real product page at http://gundogsupply.com/
adremtrainsy.html.
By default, the page title is the name of the product: Innotek ADV-300. A
better page title would beef up the name with these keywords: Innotek ADV-
300 Remote Training Collar. My dream page title would be Innotek ADV-300
Remote Training Collar $129.99, You Save $39.96 + FREE Shipping UPS Ground*
1-800-624-6378.
A bad page title would be just using your domain name in the title. A worse
page title would be stuffed with keywords like Innotek ADV-300, ADV300,
Innotech adv-300, INNOTEK Collars, and Cheap! The worst page title would be
no page title or using the same page title on multiple pages.
The page title displays in the upper left corner of your browser window when
you view a page. Search engine results pages (SERPs) show the page title as
the link to your site, so you need a well-written title to get searchers to click
your site’s listing to visit your Yahoo! Store.
Ultimately, page titles should be as long as they need to be, but I get better
rankings using 6 to 12 important keywords in a headline-like sentence that
offers solutions to my customers’ problems. Every page on your site needs a
unique title. Make sure that you use keywords in your titles, but don’t be like
some folks and just throw a list of keywords in the title.
308
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Store Editor standard templates take the page title from the text inside the
Name field unless a Page-title field is on the page, as in, for example, the
home page. You can create a better title tag on Yahoo! Stores in three ways:
 Just add keywords to the Name field.
 Create a new property on a page called Page-title and totally customize
your title tag however you want.
 Go all out with RTML and make super-smart title tags. I write RTML tem-
plates that look at each product page and add several details to the title
tag. The template looks to see whether there is a Price and a Sale-price.
If so, the template adds the retail price and the cost savings to the page
title like this: Name of Product, Only $76, Save $24.95.
If the Sale-price is higher than the minimum order needed to get free
shipping, the template throws in “- FREE Shipping US48 UPS Ground” at
the end of the title tag. RTML is cool!
You can make your titles better than the competition’s by adding text that
shows the benefits of doing business with you rather than with those other
guys. For example, add phrases like “free shipping, money-back guarantee,
your savings $10, special offer, free gift with $50 order,” or whatever promo-
tions you like to do to your title tags to get more folks to click your search-
engine listings.
Creating keyword-rich content in captions
Well-written Caption fields with your keywords used at least twice are the key
to search engine optimization. Don’t just paste a list of keywords in the Caption
field. Your customers will probably be more confused than the search engines!
You need well-written product descriptions if you want to sell something, so
make sure that you use your page keywords inside the content of your Caption
field. Find out more about keywords in Chapter 16.
One of the hardest things I have to do is convince clients to create their own
content for their Web pages. We all hear “Content is king,” but what does that
mean? From an SEO perspective, content is well-written copy, words, and
unique text that you or employees write for your Web store, which includes
everything from product captions, articles related to what you sell, buyers’
guides, product reviews, forum posts, answers to FAQs (frequently asked
questions), extended product descriptions, answers to people’s questions,
or even a glossary of industry terms. Content is really just text that the search
engine can see, but it needs to be well-written content for your visitors!
309
Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

You can even hire professional copywriters to write your content, but get
your wallet out. Good copywriters are expensive. Writing is hard work, the
mental equivalent of ditch digging. I understand that so much better than I
did a year ago after writing almost 500 pages of content for the first draft of
this book.
Duplicate content is a problem. These days, the search engines are really
good about weeding out pages with duplicate content, or pages with exactly
the same or very similar paragraphs of text that appear elsewhere on the
Web. For example, if you sell the same products as a thousand other Web
stores and you use the same product Names and Captions as all the other
retailers, Google is going to push you to the bottom of the list. You don’t
really get banned, but a filter kicks your listings two or three pages down in
the SERPs, which has almost the same effect as being banned.
The meta description isn’t as important as it once was, but I still use it. I
write a good description — a short paragraph that summarizes the products
in each section page — and place it in the Caption field and inside the
Abstract field on each section. I also show Abstracts on the section pages
and the home page.
Google shows the meta description on the SERPs page when the keyword is
found in the description. You really need a unique meta-description tag for
each page, and the only way to do unique meta descriptions with the stan-
dard templates is to override the Head-tags Variable on each page, write a
custom Meta Description tag, and paste it inside the Head-tags field.
Also, in a standard template store, you have to override the Keywords
Variable on each page and paste in a list of 15 to 20 keywords phrases to have
unique meta keywords for each page.
Standard templates also generate the Headline on section and products as an
image using the pretty, but search-engine-unfriendly, vw-img tags. You can
turn these headlines off by deselecting Display-text from the Head-elements
setting under Variables, but then you have to hand-code <H1> tags and place
them inside the Caption field. Without formatting, <H1> tags look big and
clunky, but you can easily control the look using CSS (cascading style sheets).

Even if you don’t use the Headline field, put the text from the Name inside the

bold right above the order functionality.

Linked development
Links are more than half of the SEO battle. There are three kinds of links: links
to your site from other sites, links from your site to other sites, and internal
links on your site to other pages within your site. Search engines use the
anchor text (the words in the links) from all these kinds of links to figure out
what your site is about. Link development on Yahoo! Stores includes getting
links, giving links, and optimizing your internal links.
Manipulating your own links with no guilt
Internal links help search engines see how you structure your site, how you
organize your site, and how you prioritize your pages. You have two kinds of
links in your site: navigational links that run across the site on almost every
page and spot links that occur only on one or two pages:
 Site-wide text-link navigation helps because when each page on a site
has a link to the top 20 pages in your navigation, you get a bump in
the search engines. When you’re designing your site’s navigation, con-
centrate first on helping visitors find what they’re looking for, but
include your best keywords in text links to your major section and prod-
uct pages. Tightening up your internal text navigation links can really
help your SEO efforts. If you’re using the standard templates, stick these
links in the Final-text field on the Variables page.
 Internal links from the text in your Caption fields work great, especially
when you use <strong> tags around anchors. I like four or five internal
links for each of my major keywords sprinkled around the site. Place these
links on logical, related pages, but don’t overdo it. For example, make your
site more friendly by pasting links to related products inside the Caption
fields on pages where they make the most sense. For example, if you sell
duck calls and you also sell duck call lanyards, you can link to the lan-
yards page with the following code in the Duck Calls Caption:
Also check out our <a href=duck-call-lanyards.html>duck call lanyards</a>.
You also want to make sure that your site uses similar keywords else-
where in links to the duck-call-lanyards.html page on other
relevant pages. For example, you can put lanyard links on these pages:
Gifts for Duck Hunters, Presents under $20, Retriever Training Supplies,
LanyardCorp Products, and so on. Be helpful. If you mention a related
product in a Caption field, link to it with keywords within the anchor
text. If it’s a high-priority keyword, put <strong> tags around the
keyword, too.
311
Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Linking to other cool sites actually helps your site
Outbound links (links from your site to other Web sites) tell search engines
what you think your site is about by the type of sites you link to. Momma
always said you’re known by the company you keep — birds of a feather
and all that. Your outbound links are counted as personal recommendations,
so link only to sites and pages your users would find useful and wouldn’t
embarrass you.
For example, on the Duck Calls section page, you can link to Tom Wiley’s
secrets of duck calling Web site. On product pages, you can link to the manu-
facturer’s warranty page, other product information, industry news, forums,
enthusiast sites, and even to indirect competitors’ pages if they sell what you
don’t have and your customers would appreciate it.
Look. It’s okay for people to leave your site! You’re not going to lose all your
traffic when you link to other pages. On average, you have five page views
before the average surfer is off your site to visit another site. One thing you
can do is make sure that your users can easily get back to your site after
looking at a site you link to by simply making all external links open new
browsers windows. Just add the target attribute target=_new to your
anchor tags like so:
<a href=http://www.externaldomain.com/ target=_new>anchor text</a>
Getting links to your site
Inbound links (links from other Web sites) send you Web traffic, but they also
help search engines understand your site by the content of the page linking
to your site. You get links by buying directory listings, asking more estab-
lished sites for links, buying text-link ads, doing reciprocal link exchanges
with related sites, and more. You also get links (almost by accident) by creat-
ing a Web site with useful content (articles, reviews, buyers’ guides) that
folks consider enough of a resource to link to it from their Web site.
When you ask for links, you want all links pointing to your site to use the
exact same URL (Web address) so that one domain gets credit for all those
links. I prefer the URL www.yourdomain.com with the www in the URL. It’s
important to use a consistent URL so that all your link popularity will pass to
one page for maximum bang for your buck.
I talk about buying text links, getting into directories (Yahoo! Directory,
DMOZ, JoeAnt), and acquiring links in other ways in Chapter 17, but here are
more links you need to know about:
 Deep links are links to a page deep within your site, not just your home
page. For example, a deep link is a link to a URL like www.yourdomain.
com/helpful-product-review.html or any other page other than
312
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

your home page. Search engines really like deep links! The more good
content you have, the more likely other Webmasters will link to pages
deep inside your site. I asked a manufacturer we buy from for permis-
sion to put a copy of a great article on dog training up on my site. The
article is really helpful, and I actually got a coveted DMOZ directory link
to that page.
 Reciprocal links are an example of the “You scratch my back, I’ll scratch
yours” principle. Lots of folks know that they need links, so swapping
links with other sites that swap links is a great way to get easy, if some-
what off-target, links. The search engines, especially Google, are devaluing
the benefit of reciprocal links because most of those links are swapped to
manipulate the search engines.
Without the SEO benefit, Webmasters probably wouldn’t link to most of
those sites. Make sure that any reciprocal links you swap are to related
sites and that you have plenty of good links from places you don’t link
to, like directories, your wholesalers and suppliers, and customer pages.
How many links do you need? My friend Troy Matthews (www.1twc.com)
says link building is a lot like fishing in a bass tournament. You don’t have to
be Bill Dance or catch a record-breaking fish to win the trophy; your fish just
has to be a little bit bigger than anyone else’s that day!
Look at your competitors’ back links to get an idea of how big your fish has
to be!
You know you need links, and sometimes it’s just easier to get someone else
to worry with the hassle! I’m hesitant to give away one of my secret sources,
but I do have one person I completely trust and recommend for high-value
link development. Debra O’Neil-Mastaler (www.alliance-link.com) is one
of my search-engine conference buddies. She runs with Jill Whalen and the
HighRankings.com crew, and I can’t say enough nice things about her! She’s
like my mom away from mom.
Measured results
Measuring results is mission critical. You’ll never know how well (or poorly)
you’re ranking on Google, Yahoo!, or MSN Search if you don’t measure your
results. The best measurement to track with your analytics software is how
many orders (conversions) you get from each engine and what keyword
searches converted into a sale. Who cares about traffic? I want orders! I’m in
the e-commerce business, not the e-visitor business! See Chapter 20 for more
information about seeing the details of search-engine traffic through the Store
Manager’s References reports.
313
Chapter 19: Discovering Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

You can also track how many pages you have indexed in the engines, how
many back links (pages linking back to you) you have, and what position
your site is ranked for each keyword phrase.
Use position checkers to see how well you rank for specific keywords. Get the
Maalox first, though. I hope you don’t get motion sickness because you’re
going to move up and down in the SERPs. Bruce Clay’s SEOToolset.com offers
a suite of SEO Tools that I love. It’s an online tool, so you can check how you’re
doing from any online connection. See Chapter 25 for more on this and other
tools I use for SEO improvement and reporting.
Before I start making any changes to a new site, I gather my top 200 keywords
and take a baseline ranking. See where you rank today and check it pretty
regularly. Hopefully, I can watch my position in the engines improve as I add
more content and get more links. Engines don’t like anything automated that
queries their engines too much, so be careful. Every week or so should be
fine for your top 200 keywords.
Create some SEO pet projects. Take more competitive keywords where you
don’t rank as well as you would like and work on them in particular. Develop
more content and actively target links for those pages. Track a “favorite”
competitor who is beating you on certain engines. Try to figure out how the
company is beating you and then use its SEO techniques against it. Have fun
and try not to stress out about your search-engine rankings.
Doing Your SEO Homework
“Free” search-engine traffic comes with a price to be paid. The opportunity
cost of SEO can be very high. Staying on top of the search-engine game
means that you’re always working to keep up with changes the search
engines make. You also have to stay ahead of folks in your industry who are
trying to get your biscuit.
Search engine optimization is a zero-sum game. That means that it has win-
ners and losers. A given keyword has only ten positions on page one. If
someone moves up into the top ten for a keyword, that means someone
else is moving out.
It’s a jungle out there! Some of your competitors will do almost anything to
get ahead of you in the search results. It can be incredibly frustrating when
spammers try to cheat the engines by using short-sighted tactics to deceive
the engines. Sometimes the engines don’t catch the most blatant spammers
because they have bigger fish to fry, such as the porn, pills, and casino guys.
314
Part IV: Profiting from Internet Marketing 

Also, much of the information that is publicly available on SEO is either out-
dated, misinformation, or simply just wrong. There is also a lot of information
on techniques that may work for a short while but result in getting you
banned from various engines.
You can do basic SEO yourself, or you can outsource it to any number of SEO
consultants or agencies. Most SEO is done by figuring out which factors the
search engines use to determine which pages are most relevant for a given
search and then making sure that your pages are as relevant as they can be
for the topics they’re about. My recommendation, like everything else, is to
do a little bit yourself and see whether you have a knack for it; if so, keep on
keeping on. If you find an SEO you trust and can afford, then give him the
keys and let him drive.
One of my old clients was paying a major SEO firm $2,100 a month for
“advanced” SEO. All the SEO company did was come in and write custom
meta keyword and description tags for 100 section pages and then send him
ranking reports every month. That’s pretty cold! My client slept better at
night knowing that he was doing something about SEO, but he was really get-
ting, uh, underserviced for what he was paying.
If you’re hiring someone for search engine optimization work, look at exam-
ples in her portfolio. View the source on the home page of one of her projects
and make a list of all the keywords in the title tag. Do some rank checking to
see how well this site ranks on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN for all the keywords
listed in the keywords tag on her home page. If the site doesn’t rank in the
top ten results, you may want to consider hiring another firm.
Also, lots of snake-oil SEOs are aggressive telemarketers and cold-call folks
with new domains with promises of top ten rankings. Buyer beware! These
folks are sometimes so rude that you can’t get a word in edgewise, so I often
end up hanging up on them.
If you get anywhere near the amount of spam in your Inbox that I do, you’re
painfully aware that many folks describe themselves as “Search Engine
Experts.” Some of these folks use dangerous or deceptive practices, and in
the end, you, the site owner, are the one who pays the price.
Need a good firm? You have friends. Ask around. Find someone else who is
happy with his SEO firm and has been for years. Go with a solid referral and
do your homework. Be careful!
I do my own SEO and most of my own link development, but because I go to
all these search-engine conferences five or six times a year, I have a Rolodex
full of world-class SEOs. Drop me an e-mail for a list of folks I recommend
because Yahoo! Stores are a little funky. The RTML part makes some SEOs’
heads explode.

Exploring more with SEO resources
Here are a few more resources for you — just in
case you were mesmerized by this topic!
 Brett Tabke’s WebmasterWorld.com has
millions of pages on every subject from
search engine optimization to e-commerce
to basic Webmaster questions. The site is
free, but all the really, really good stuff is
posted in the supporters’ forum, which you
can access for $149 a year. Brett also hosts
PubCon several times a year all over the
world, and I attend every chance I get.
 Danny Sullivan’s SearchEngineWatch.com
is a tremendous resource on search
engines and Internet marketing. SEW has
forums, articles, and a valuable newsletter,
and hosts the Search Engine Strategies
conferences in New York, Chicago, and San
Jose every year. SES is expensive, but worth
it. I also go to every SES conference I can.
 Jill Whelan is a top white-hat SEO,
author, and speaker, as well as owner of
HighRankings.com, where you can sign up
for Jill’s newsletter, read articles, and par-
ticipate in the forums.
 The name Bruce Clay has been synony-
mous with search engine optimization since
1997 or so. BruceClay.com has tons of free
information. His other site, SEOToolset.com,
has a suite of valuable search engine opti-
mization tools, which I use. Bruce also
offers a search engine optimization training
course, which I took and highly recommend
for retailers.
 Matt Cutts is a senior engineer at Google in
charge of search quality, which is really
just a polite way of saying he hunts down
and kills spammy Web sites. Read his un-
official, but extremely relevant, search blog
at www.mattcutts.com/blog for
firsthand information on what Google
wants and doesn’t want in a Web site.

Making More
Money with Your
Yahoo! Store

In this part . . .
W
hen I talk to most Yahoo! Store owners, I find that
every question they ask me pretty much fits into
one of two buckets: either how to save time or how to
make more money. I don’t know about you, but I’m in this
business for the money. Don’t get me wrong! I love what
I do, and people are way more important to me than pro-
fits, but when I’m at work, I’m here to make a buck. I’m
either working on things to take better care of my clients
(and sell more stuff) or automating repetitive tasks and
minimizing, or completely eliminating, mindless tasks
and busywork to save my ever-dwindling supply of time.
In this part, I show you how to do a little bit of both: save
time and make more money. You discover how to increase
traffic and sales by seeing where customers come from
and improving your store (reading store statistics), convert
more of the existing traffic you have into sales (conversion
rate), spend less time getting new products up on your
Web store (product uploads), get more sales from existing
customers (e-mail newsletters), and make sure that your
domain name is configured in a search-engine-friendly way.
I also introduce Yahoo! Small Business Web hosting and
the other ways to build Yahoo! Stores, Store Tags + Catalog
Manager, just so you know what you’re (not) missing.
Look: Some of this part isn’t for the squeamish or newbies.
Here, I talk about very powerful and effective ways to save
time building and managing your Yahoo! Store, but it’s not
unlike working with a nail gun! There’s a pretty big down-
side if things get out of control. Please be careful! Don’t play
with database uploads if you don’t feel extremely comfort-
able because you could blow up your store. And don’t mess
with your domain name and where it points unless you
have a new store or understand the implications with
search engines.

Running Your Business
by the Numbers
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with traffic, revenue, conversion rate, and more
 Keeping your eye on the most important metrics
 Crunching numbers to product profits
W
hen I talk about running your business by the numbers, I’m more con-
cerned with the “running your business” part than the “numbers” part.
Minding the numbers is extremely important for the success of your business,
but you don’t want to get lost in a jungle of data. You have to see both the
forest and the trees. Your Yahoo! Store Manager comes with all these cool
tools, graphs, reports, and statistics, but you need to watch the right indicators
to measure how you’re doing and to see what you need to work on.
In this chapter, I show you what information you can get out of your Yahoo!
Store Manager and which part of it is worth looking at. I explore the full range
of Store Manager reports and introduce some third-party tools. I also explain
why I track the things I do. Pretty much every evening, I take a quick daily
pulse to make sure that my Yahoo! Stores are healthy. I track other numbers,
too, so when a site has a hiccup and sales drop suddenly, I can quickly dis-
cover what’s wrong and fix it.
Discovering What You Need to Know
This chapter is not about accounting! When it comes to the numbers in this
chapter, I’m really looking at traffic and sales on your Yahoo! Store. As a busi-
ness owner, you’d better be watching all the other numbers, too, especially
your overhead and profit margin. Payroll seems to be the biggest expense for
growing retailers, but pay-per-click advertising can eat you alive, as I discuss
in Chapter 18. Your accountant (and you better have a good one!) can give
you better benchmarks to make sure that your overhead doesn’t pull you

under. Fortunately, we have accountants in the family. Uncle Paul crunches
the numbers and keeps us on track, but more importantly, he shares his
Mississippi State tickets (and I mean the good seats)!
I really got into the Yahoo! Store stats back in 1997 when I opened my first
Viaweb store. It blew my mind that you could see exactly how your cus-
tomers found you and watch their actions in your store. Remember, I’ve
always been a retailer, and prior to 1997, all my experience was in owning
brick-and-mortar stores. I used to pour over my sales statistics from my
point-of-sale system, but I never really geeked out on statistics until I opened
a Yahoo! Store.
Every day I look at daily sales, visitors to the site, and number of orders. I
also track conversion rate (percentage of visitors who order), number of
Shopping Carts started compared to actual orders, how much I spent on
Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly Overture) clicks,
how much free traffic I got from the search engines, and even more. When
something’s on fire, I’ve got to know what the deal is.
Figure 20-1 shows the Store Manager of a real Yahoo! Store (and, no, I’m not
telling what it’s selling), which displays the sales and Page Views from the
last 120 days. I wish the fine folks in Sunnyvale would let us pick which
graphs to show on the front page, but having those two isn’t all bad. You
have to have traffic (visitors) to your site before you can sell anything, but
for me, conversion rate is the most important number for a Web retailer.
Conversion rate (%) is the percentage of visitors to your Web site that buy
something. You can find this number for your Yahoo! Store by looking at the
Orders/Customer graph in the Store Manager. If you can increase your con-
version rate even just a little bit, you can exponentially increase your store’s
success.
Tracking and improving your conversion rate is the secret to the e-commerce
universe.
The longer the date range you’re looking at, the larger the sample of data.
Larger samples mean longer periods of time, which seem to even out the
daily ups and downs of business. Larger samples give you more reliable infor-
mation on trends. Any trend less than 90 days can be a fluke. Ask your
favorite economics professor for his opinion, but my dad wouldn’t listen to
me when I got excited about a change in the site if the time period was any-
thing less than three months.
You can choose from several date ranges in Store Manager’s Sales report
(under Statistics): Last 10 days, Last 30 Days, Last 60 Days, Last 90 Days, Last
120 Days, Last 180 Days, and Last 365 Days. You can also view stats by the
calendar month (for the last five months). Graphs have custom date ranges
so that you can see patterns over months or even years.
320
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Introducing Yahoo! Store Statistics
The smart folks who designed the Store Manager back in the mid-1990s
understood that certain numbers are important to retailers, so the first thing
you see when you log in to the Store Manager are graphs for Page Views and
Revenue for the last 120 days. I love my Yahoo! Store stats, especially Store
References. You can see where folks are coming from, what words they
searched for, and whether that keyword resulted in a sale.
Yahoo! Store stats are good, but they’re far from perfect. Sometimes the stats
don’t track certain types of sales. Sometimes they’re way off, listing a referrer
that was for another Yahoo! Store. Sometimes the cookie data gets garbled. It
can be a little frustrating to have missing or plain wrong information. Even if
Your Yahoo! Store stats aren’t perfect, they’re consistent, which means that
you can use them to see how you’re doing.
I overcompensate for the holes in Yahoo! Store tracking by running two or
three additional Web analytics programs and return on investment (ROI)
tracking tools. Multiple programs give me overlapping results.
Figure 20-1:

321
Chapter 20: Running Your Business by the Numbers

If you use a third-party tracking tool, make sure that it’s compatible with
Yahoo! Store and can import the revenue number. More tracking packages
will work with the new Checkout Manager (see Chapter 14), which should
be online full-time in early 2006, but I highly recommend taking a look at
ClickTracks (www.clicktracks.com), Keywordmax (www.keywordmax.
com), and EngineReady (www.engineready.com) for more and better infor-
mation about who’s visiting your store and what’s selling. I discuss it a little
more in Chapters 18 and 25.
It’s probably overkill, but I want to grab every converting keyword I can. I’m
not ashamed to admit that I’m obsessed with conversion rate, and the secret
to conversions is converting keywords, which you can read more about in
Chapter 16 and at http://ystore.blogs.com in my Yahoo! Store market-
ing blog.
Most of the numbers I’m interested in are found under the Store Manager’s
Statistics tab, which links to separate reports for Page Views (shows most
popular pages by hits), Sales (shows bestselling products), References
(shows referral information on sources of traffic and sales), Graphs (creates
graphs of page views, sales, customers, and so on), Click Trails (looks at indi-
vidual customer click trails over time), Reports (provides downloadable
reports of traffic and sales), and a few others. I cover all these reports in the
upcoming sections.
Page Views
Page Views is the first link under the Statistics tab and shows you the top 50
section or item pages in descending order by hits (or page views) for the past
365 days. You can sort By Hits, By Count Of Items Sold, By Count Of Orders,
or By Revenue.
Keep in mind that even though the Page Views report shows revenue (sales)
info, the Sales report (see the next section in this chapter) is a much better
report for looking at what’s selling.
I use the Page Views report to see which section pages are the most popular
pages. First, I make sure that my site-navigation features link to these pages. I
also make sure that these pages feature links to my best deals and promo-
tions. Finally, I want these pages to load fast, so I minimize slow-loading
graphics. See Chapter 21 for more information.
322

Sales
Figure 20-2 displays the Sales report from a third real-live Yahoo! Store (and,
no, I’m still not telling), which is the second link under the Store Manager’s
Statistics Column. Click the Sales link to see your top 50 products in descend-
ing order By Count Of Items Sold for the past 365 days. You can also sort the
Sales report By Count Of Orders or By Revenue (sales).
Click the See More, See All, or See Fewer link to change the number of results
in your report, but if you want to get all the data, click the Spreadsheet link to
download a CSV spreadsheet file with the following fields: Name, Items Sold,
Revenue, Page Views, ID, Code, and Price.
I use the CSV file to get all kinds of info. Having the IDs makes all the differ-
ence in the world!

Chapter 20: Running Your Business by the Numbers

For more established stores, the bestselling products tend to generate 50 or
more sales per month, not per year, so this feature is best accessed on reports
with smaller date ranges. For specific product information, set a really short
date range, such as Past 30 Or 60 Days, to dig out those golden nuggets.
Also look at the products that sell the most dollar volume. If you sell a thou-
sand products, the majority of your sales probably come from the top 200
items. I want to find out more about those top-sellers, and I’m not really inter-
ested in the conversion rate of whatever is ranked #878.
Don’t forget to look at your bestselling products that have the highest con-
version rates. You have to figure out this number yourself by dividing the
number of orders by the number of page views, which is much easier to do
in Excel. Popular product pages that don’t convert as well as other product
pages have a flaw somewhere. The product may be flawed or overpriced, or
the page design may be the problem. The product page may be too heavy
or lack compelling sales copy.
References
Figure 20-3 shows a References report from another real-live Yahoo! Store
(where yet again I’ve erased all identifiable store data), with visits, orders,
revenue, revenue per visit, and referring URL. Most of your traffic will be from
Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and high-traffic sites that link to you. Roughly 60 per-
cent of your sales will have referrer data, and the rest winds up in the
Bermuda Triangle.
Some sales don’t have referrer data because shoppers come from bookmarks
or they type your domain name in their browser, which is a really good thing
because it means that people like you well enough to remember your URL.
Some third-party tracking tools (such as ClickTracks and Engine Ready) can
track up to half of this “missing” referrer data, which is why I pay extra each
month for my third-party analytic tools. I discuss these tools in Chapter 25.
Google bought an analytics company called Urchin last year and now gives
away its analytics software to gather more information about how people use
the Web, as well as in the hope that you’ll use it to improve your site and
spend more on Google AdWords. For more information on this free program,
visit www.google.com/analytics. For more about Google AdWords and
paid search, see Chapter 18.
Figure 20-4 shows that the dollars are in the details. All the really good data in

ring URL for an eye-opening look at exactly what pages or keyword searches
are sending you sales and traffic.

You can find out a lot by reviewing the information in the Details link:
 Scroll to the bottom to change the report’s Period (date range) or the
Sort method (Visits, Orders, or Income). The report defaults to the last
180 days and sorts in descending order by visits.
 Click the Referring URL link, and you see the current search results on
the search engine for that particular keyword phrase. Each of the
Details links next to the Referring URL is a link to the search results for the
keywords that sent you the traffic. Clicking is much easier than typing!
 Click the By Income link to sort the Details page in descending order
by revenue. This is a great way to see your converting keywords, which
are the search phrases that result in a sale. (For more on keywords, see
Chapter 16.)
 Look in the upper left corner of Referrer Details to see how many
unique keyword phrases folks sent you traffic for that particular
engine. You can also see the total number of visitors sent on the
References page or on the bottom of the Referrer details page. For exam-
ple, the Google Details report says 50/8414 entries shown, which means
that 8,414 different keyword searches on Google drove those 140,383
people from Google to this client’s site. See Chapter 19 for more on
search engine optimization for free traffic.

the date range set at the bottom of the report page. Sometimes it’s
easier to view all the data offline than online.
 The CSV export is limited to 10,000 lines, so if you have more key-

 Set the date range to the earliest calendar month by selecting the
applicable radio button, click the Show button, and then click the
Download: Spreadsheet link. Do this every month for each engine that
sends you a lot of traffic. Your Yahoo! Store only saves this Referring
URL info for the last six months. Every month, you lose a month’s worth
of keyword data. The converting keyword data is still attached to each
individual order, but it’s worth the trouble of grabbing this data every
month to see which words you rank well for, which words get traffic but
don’t convert, and so on.

Store Searches
See what search words are popular on your internal store site search by
clicking the Store Searches link under Statistics. Scroll to the bottom of the
report and change the report from Search Strings (phrases) to Individual
Words to see the most popular words used. Store Searches aren’t available
in the Merchant Starter package.
Results from Store Searches tell you a lot about what folks can’t find on your
store. Popular keywords give you ideas to improve your site navigation by
seeing what folks couldn’t find by simply navigating your store. See what
people really call the things that you sell by the names they type into search.
Collect popular misspellings to beef up your meta-tags and misspellings

currently sell.
Shopping Searches
See last week’s top 100 searches on Yahoo! Shopping. This report shows
you how seasonal Yahoo! Shopping can be. In May, it’s all about the prom
dresses, and then the next month, wedding dresses are shooting up the
charts. Around Halloween, Star Wars costumes are hot. For more information
on Yahoo! Shopping, see Chapter 17. Shopping Searches aren’t available in
the Merchant Starter package.
Graphs
Graphs is the sixth link under the Statistics tab and gives you 20 different
graphs over any date range you want. Although there may be 20 graphs, only
four of them matter to me: Customers, Revenue, Number Of Orders, and
Orders/Customer.
Because the information in graphs is pretty broad, it doesn’t take up that
much room, so Yahoo! doesn’t delete any of it. There’s also a custom date
range, so I can set the date range to the month of June back in 1997 and
remember the good ol’ days. . . .
Figure 20-5 displays a store’s Revenue. Orders/Customer is really your con-
version rate, or the percentage of visitors who buy something. Everything
else is what my dad would call “neat to know (but what can you do with it?).”
Again, see Chapter 21 for more information on increasing usability and (more
importantly) conversion rate.

Figure 20-6 shows Customers from another honest-to-goodness Yahoo! Store
over the past 365 days. The label Customers is somewhat of a misnomer
because to me, a customer is someone who buys something; these folks are
visitors. Of course, 1.3 million “customers” is nothing to sneeze at!
Reports
Reports is the eighth link under the Statistics tab and lets you see Page Views,
Customers, Page Views/Customer, (Number Of) Orders, Income, Items Sold,
and Average Order. You can see this data Monthly, Weekly, or Daily, but Yahoo!
only keeps the daily data for about six months.

Click the Export To Excel link to get this data in a handy CSV text file, which
is cool for looking at trends over weeks or months. Sometimes the data in
Reports doesn’t update as fast as the rest of the site, and sometimes deleted
orders still show up. This information is very good for broad decision making,
but I don’t use it for accounting or anything that needs to be 100 percent right.
Click Trails
Click Trails is the seventh link under the Statistics tab and gives you another
(kind of wacky) way to measure customer traffic and see where folks went on
the site. You can see the number of users as well as each individual Click
Trail for each day’s traffic with these three links: Click Trails, Trails Where
The Order Button Was Pressed, and Trails That Resulted In An Order. Click
Trails aren’t available in the Merchant Starter package.
Unfortunately, you have to look at click trails day by day. You can’t download
them, and Yahoo! deletes them after 60 days or so. My assistant logs in every
week and grabs those three numbers by hand for every store we track. It’s
that important! I call these trails, carts, and orders. On an average Yahoo!
Store, for every 100 trails, I see 3 or 4 carts and 1 or 2 orders.
Here are a few things you should think about:
 Look at Trails That Resulted In An Order to retrace the steps used by an
actual customer to place an order. I find out more about how customers
use a site by looking at this level. Notice that almost all new customers
look at your info.html page.
 Also look at Trails Where The Order Button Was Pressed (but didn’t
result in an order) to see whether you can figure out what happened
from when the fish was on the line to why it didn’t make it into the boat.
 When your traffic shoots up, sometimes your conversion rate suffers
because you get a lot of junk traffic.
 If you ever want to see what time of the day people do things, select
Graph Daily Cycle when you’re playing with Graphs. Even in 1997, I see
the same thing I see today: The majority of traffic and sales are in a 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. hump followed by a second, slightly smaller hump from 5 to
9 p.m. If you take phone orders, consider being open later for the folks
shopping after work.

 Understanding conversion rate and Web usability

 Increasing your conversion rate to make more money
 Decreasing load time by slimming down your image files
 Increasing sales by making your site user-friendly
F
irst impressions are critical for converting shoppers into buying cus-
tomers. When new visitors first land on your store pages, your store must
look as though you have what they are looking for long enough to keep them
from clicking the Back button. Next, your online store must be easy enough
to navigate and search so that customers can quickly find what they want.
Your customers might not know exactly what they want, so you must be pre-
pared to help them out with informative articles, product reviews, and
buyers’ guides that tell them what kinds of products solve their problems.
Product pages must sell using words and pictures to create enough interest
and direct customers to buy through calls to action in the copy and on the
Order buttons. Your store must look credible to instill enough confidence for
customers to click the Add To Cart button. Finally, your checkout process
must appear safe and secure, be easy enough to use, and focus on the task of
completing an order.
In this chapter, I discuss the keys to improving your store’s conversion rate
and Web usability, show you how to make your store easier to use, and
explore some things I’ve discovered over the past nine years to convert more
browsers into buyers!
Getting Shoppers to Buy
Conversion rate is so important, but jumping through all those hoops sounds
pretty hairy! Fortunately, it’s not that hard. You can make a few simple (but
extremely important) changes to your site that will increase your conversion

rate. Conversion rate is the percentage of shoppers that visits your Web store
and actually places an order. I believe that this is the most important number
for most e-commerce businesses to be aware of.
Unfortunately, many merchants don’t even track their store’s conversion
rate, much less attempt to improve it. You have several ways to increase con-
version rate, but the easiest is to improve your Web site’s usability. Web
usability is the study of making Web sites easier to use by using established
design conventions, making your site load faster, using positive language,
communicating clearly, and testing your site with real users.
Increasing your site’s traffic is not enough
Getting traffic to your Web site can be a full-time job in itself. After all this
traffic gets to your site, you still have to jump over several more hurdles
before you get the first order!
First, you have to make sure that your site grabs and holds the attention of
your shoppers. Second, you have to do everything in your power to improve
your customer conversion machine (your store) before you start spending
big bucks to attract more visitors to it. Fixing the “machine” gets you more
traffic. So, make your site easier to use by implementing Web usability best
practices (which I discuss a little later in this chapter).
Make sure that you’re selling something that folks want to buy, and at a com-
petitive price. Check out Chapter 2 for some ideas on business models and
how to figure out what else to sell.
Increasing sales by creating 
quality content
When you make a point of improving the quality of your content, something
very cool happens: More and more shoppers are converted to buyers.
Adding articles, buyers’ guides, product FAQs, additional product pictures,
reviews, and so on is like pouring chum into the water when you’re going
fishing. Customers just eat that stuff up, and the search engines do, too!
Explain which products are good for what, and take an editorial position on
them; that is, describe what you like and dislike about certain models.
Provide more information about products than what anyone can cut and
paste from the manufacturers’ sites: a stock product photo and a lame prod-
uct description. Take additional photos of the product, explain its features,
and describe how those features solve people’s problems. This information is
what makes folks want to buy what you sell.
332
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

For example, after our dad died, my brother, Steve, became the president of
our family business, and Steve was much more willing than my dad ever was
to share his expertise and opinions on dog-training gear in public. My brother
is, uh, rather opinionated sometimes with online editorials and product
reviews, but this works to his advantage because people want to know what
real people think about products they are thinking about buying. After Steve
began sharing his opinions on the site, sales immediately went up, especially
for items with expanded product information or product reviews.
When you add content to your site, you also increase the stickiness of your
site, or the length of time folks stay on your site. My friend, Internet market-
ing guru Craig Paddock, says that he sees a direct correlation between the
amount of time someone spends on your site and that person’s likelihood to
convert into a paying customer. This fact alone is an argument in favor of
bulking up the product information on your site.
Some folks don’t buy on the first visit. It’s completely understandable when
a brand-new visitor says, “Uh, I just don’t think we’re ready to Place Order at
this point in our relationship. I mean, I just found you on Google two minutes
ago. I don’t even know you. How about I just Add To My Cart for now?”
Craig Paddock believes in micro-conversions, or steps to conversions. He
says that because it often takes many visits to your site before some people
buy, your job is to get them one step closer to the Shopping Cart or checkout
than they would have taken otherwise. This is the secret to increasing your
online sales.
Some folks who visit your site will never buy. Period. This includes those
conducting shopping research for purchases to be made offline, tire-kickers,
competitors, and irrelevant traffic from weird search-engine queries that are
the Internet equivalent of a wrong telephone number. You probably have a lot
of unqualified traffic, too, or folks who might be interested in what you sell,
but aren’t very likely to buy something. These folks will click your paid-
search ad just to see what your site sells.
Building Customer Confidence
Instill confidence in shoppers by looking like a professional organization, but
at the same time, give your site a human face. It’s like what Momma always
said: “Just be yourself.”
 Have a professional-looking site. Make sure that your information is
always current (keep copyrights up to date, eliminate seasonal promo-
tions and special offers that are past due, and so on). Spell-check your
site. The only typos you want are for search engines on your “commonly
misspelled words page,” with links to the real pages. Watch out for any
333
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

anti-customer language such as “We reserve the right to refuse service
to anyone” or anything that sounds as though it were written by a
bureaucrat.
 Tell me how to reach you. Provide full contact information. Divulge
your physical address, phone numbers, fax number, e-mail address, busi-
ness hours, and any other pertinent contact data I need to get in touch
with you. Look like a real company, not someone hiding behind the
anonymity of the Web.
 Give me your number. You need an 800 number displayed prominently
on your site. Feature that number on every page, in the Shopping Cart,
and all over the checkout pages. Put your phone hours under your 800
number. You might prefer that folks order online, but give them the
option to order by phone. Offering customers the option of ordering via
your 800 number significantly increases Web conversions because cus-
tomers feel more secure when they have another way to reach you —
even if they never use it.
Also, an 800 number is much better than the other free prefixes (such as
866, 877, or 888) because everyone knows what an 800 number is.
Having an 800 number makes your business look more established, too.
There aren’t any “fresh” 800 numbers left these days, but if you insist,
your telephone service provider will find you someone’s old, discarded
number, which will work just great!
 Tell me your story. Write bios of the company’s principals. Write a com-
pelling (but truthful) About Us or company background page.
 Show me some pictures. Provide real photos of you, your employees,
your location (your building or shipping warehouse), and even some of
your customers if they’ll give you permission (by e-mail is fine). Don’t
use clip art or stock photography. Look, you don’t have to be a super-
model to have your photo on the Web. The less slick the photos look,
the more real they look.
 Be your own company spokesmodel. If you’re in retail, you’re probably
the public face of your company, whether or not you want to admit it.
Put your name (and reputation) on your Web site; doing so gives a signif-
icant boost to the credibility of your content.
 Be small if you’re small. On the Internet, it’s hard to tell the size of a
company by the size or quality of its Web site. Take advantage of the fact
that you’re a tiny operation and that customers therefore receive per-
sonalized service and support from the owner of the company. It’s okay
to admit that you’re a small, one-woman operation because you’ll give a
level of attention that someone won’t get shopping at an Amazon.com.
Personally, I don’t want to buy from BigBoxCo, Inc. with 24-hour phone
support. I want to buy from someone real who knows what they’re talking
about. Someone who will be there when I have questions and if I have a
problem. Someone who cares about me as a customer. I prefer to deal
334
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

with the owner so that if I have a problem, I know I’m talking with some-
one whose house payment depends on keeping me a happy customer.
 Prove that you are a legitimate business. Tell me your history. In the
Internet age, the length of time you’ve been in business says a lot. No
one will toot your own horn for you. Tell me about your certifications;
that you’re licensed, bonded, and insured; and that you’ve won industry
awards for exceptional customer service. List your bibliography of 
credibility-building articles, books, or speaking engagements.
 Collect and publish customer testimonials. It’s pretty cool for you to
tell folks how great you are, but when folks who gave you money want to
brag on you, let ’em brag. Get permission before using folks’ names, but
don’t be shy about asking. When you get e-mails of praise, reply and
simply ask permission to add their name and comments (but not their
e-mail address) to your testimonials page. After I get permission, I put
their comments online and then e-mail them the URL to make sure that
they’re happy with how it looks; if they’re not, I fix it to their satisfaction
like a duck on a June bug. Link to these customer comments pages from
your Shopping Cart and checkout where appropriate.
Employ trust symbols
Trust symbols are visual icons or logos representing known institutions that
are somehow affiliated with a retailer to verify an online merchant’s credibil-
ity. Trust symbols work even better when they are linked to independent
Web sites and offer independent reviews or complaint resolution. Examples
of trust symbols that you pay for one way or another (through dues, fees,
percentage of sales, and so on) are industry trade associations (shop.org),
shopping sites (Yahoo! Shopping), consumer protection groups (TrustE,
BBBonline), and Internet security companies (ScanAlerts’s Hackersafe logo,
www.scanalert.com).
Some trust symbols that don’t cost a thing are credit-card logos such as Visa,
MasterCard, Discover, American Express, and PayPal, and you can use these
to show accepted payment methods. Show the Y! hosting logo and, as noted
previously, Yahoo! Shopping logo. Shipping carrier logos (UPS or FedEx)
linked to your shipping info pages work well. Show manufacturer and brand
logos on product pages. Display a graphic emphasizing that your checkout is
safe and secure through SSL (Secure Socket Layer) with 128-bit encryption.
Offer better customer service
Reduce or eliminate risk with a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Make returns,
exchanges, and canceled orders easy. Have a well-organized Info page with
FAQ-style links. Answer e-mails quickly — within one business day, tops.
Take the time to write answers to FAQs and put them on the site. Consider an
335
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

autoresponder, which is an automated e-mail tool that instantly replies to
e-mail questions with links to FAQs when you’ll be away from your e-mail for
a while. I use www.aweber.com for all my autoresponders. Ask for questions
and feedback on the Web site. Offer help everywhere with links to info and
privacy pages. Have a simple, understandable privacy policy.
Improve product pages to increase sales
The product page is where the decision to buy occurs. Improvements on the
product level give you the best chance to sell more to folks on your site. Get
the biggest bang for your buck by spending your time grooming your best-
selling products’ product pages. Don’t distract folks from focusing on the task
at hand because of hyperactive navigation. In fact, I like to isolate product
pages from site-wide navigation to minimize distractions.
These tips can help you improve your product pages:
 Write a compelling headline that gives a benefit. Turn features into
benefits. For example, “This car goes 180 mph, which means that you’ll
never be late to work again. . . .”
 Call it what it is. Make sure that the Name field contains the exact prod-
uct name, brand, and model number as well as what everyone else calls it.
 Tell me all about it. Write a unique product description in your Caption
field with more information than the manufacturer’s product page pro-
vides. Link to warranty information and show all accessories and related
products.
 Make the price bigger. No, even bigger than that. And red. Have a Sale-
price and List price (if you discount) because you’ll sell more when
people know they’re saving money. 
 Show product availability. Display estimated ship date and delivery time
on the product page before customers add a product to their Shopping
Cart. Add a quantity field if you sell items commonly bought in bulk. You’ll
need RTML to do this (see Chapter 26). When something sells out and you
can’t get it anymore, either delete these extinct items or link to alternative
or replacement products, but either way, remove these links from normal
section or category pages. Nothing is worse than having a customer want-
ing to buy something that you can’t sell her!
 Show more photos, bigger photos, better photos. Show a picture of the
box. Show product details that you couldn’t see even if you were in a
real store. Make sure that you watermark your name or domain all over
these photos, because competitors will steal them. See Chapter 8 for
more info on images.
 Nothing succeeds like success. Put the word Bestseller in your best-
selling products Name field (top 40) for another boost in sales. Shoppers
feel more comfortable buying what other folks buy.
336
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

 Write a Buyer’s Guide for each product category. Write a product FAQ
(frequently asked questions) list if you get asked many questions about
specific products.
 Change text on your Buy buttons from Order to Add To Cart. This is
the Order-text setting under Variables in the Store Editor. Add To Cart is
much less of a commitment than Order or Buy.
 Change the name of the button that links to your Shopping Cart. The
default Show-order-text setting under Variables is Show Order, which I
change to Show Shopping Cart or My Shopping Cart.
 Make the Add To Cart button really, really, really big. And red. And
place it high on page, preferably on the right side, and above the fold so
that folks can see it when they first see the product page without
scrolling. You’ll need RTML for this, so see Chapter 26 for more info.
This point is so important that it’s worth repeating: The product page is where
the decision to buy occurs. Make sure that your bestselling product pages put
their best face forward with fantastic photography. Craft compelling headlines
with a call to action (Order now!) and the benefits of buying. Produce personal,
sales-driven copy with well-written product captions that turn features into
benefits and motivate browsers to become buyers.
Convert more Shopping Carts
Here’s a real-world example using a Yahoo! Store that’s been around for at
least three years. For every 100 people who visit Merchant X’s online store,
5.2 percent of all shoppers click the Add To Cart button and place a product
into the Shopping Cart; 4.5 percent of all shoppers start the checkout
process; 3.6 percent of all shoppers make it to the second page of checkout
(billing page); and 3.1 percent of all shoppers place an order online. Another
1 percent of all shoppers call in to place an order over the phone.
Almost 95 percent of visitors (what Yahoo! calls customers, or unique visitors)
never even use the Shopping Cart. Ouch! Only around 5 percent of all visitors
start a Shopping Cart, with 61 percent of those folks actually placing orders
(completed carts). Around 70 percent of folks who start the checkout
process actually finish and place an order, which I call a completed cart.
Ultimately, you want to make checking out fast, easy, and stress-free. Make sure
that customers can focus on completing the checkout process by eliminating
distractions such as external site navigation. Also, the only links to have here
are ones that go back to the cart and that continue the checkout process. Make
sure that your checkout branding (logos) and look and feel (colors and fonts)
match the look of your store so that no disconnect occurs when customers
move from store pages into the checkout process.
337
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

Improve your Shopping Carts
Call your cart a Shopping Cart, not a shopping basket or a shopping bag or a
shopping bucket. The online Shopping Cart is a well-known Web convention at
this point. Virtually everyone knows that e-commerce sites use Shopping Carts,
so don’t be cute. Here are some tips to get more folks to the Checkout pages:
 Place a View Cart button or link prominently on every page. I prefer
to place a Shopping Cart/Checkout icon or link (or both) in the right-
uppermost corner of every page.
 Make the Proceed To Checkout button big and place it high on the
Shopping Cart page. See Chapter 14 for more on the new Checkout
Manager. I like to minimize the branding and navigation that appears
above the cart’s contents to pull up that Proceed To Checkout button.
 Make the Keep Shopping button or link go back to the previous product
page. By default, the Yahoo! Store’s Keep Shopping link takes customers
back to the previous product page unless you change the variable
Continue-url. Don’t change this unless you have a very good reason.
 In the Shopping Cart, tell customers how to do three things: keep shop-
ping, edit the contents of their cart, or check out. Show your 800 number
and phone hours. Push your 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Link to your
info.html page for contact information. Push the free shipping offer.
Talk about shipping and delivery on the Shipping Info Checkout page
Tell customers that you have their stuff (Availability), what company you’ll
ship it through (Shipping Options), and how fast they’ll get their stuff
(Delivery Time). Push free shipping or other shipping promotions. Here’s
more on what to show on the Shipping Info Checkout page:
 Display all shipping charges before checkout to reduce the number of
abandoned carts. Show shipping prices on the product page if you can.
Estimate ship date and delivery time.
 Make your shipping rates easy to understand. I like having a free ship-
ping promotion on all domestic (US48) orders above a certain dollar
amount (usually my average sale), and flat-rate shipping for all other
domestic orders, which covers 95 percent of your orders. I have separate
shipping rates for bulky items, express delivery, Alaska/Hawaii/Puerto
Rico, APO, and Canada.
 Free shipping works great if you can afford it. Make free shipping an
incentive to increase order size. Push FREE SHIPPING on every page and
in title tags and abstracts for items that qualify.
 Remove unnecessary data fields on the checkout forms. Don’t collect
any info you don’t need. See Chapter 14 on how to remove unnecessary
fields and clean up your store’s checkout.
338
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

 Use a Progress Indicator graphic. This graphic says, “You are here.
Here’s what’s left to do to place an order,” and it is now provided in
the new Checkout Manager (Chapter 14). Back in the good ol’ days
(2005 and earlier), we had to make our checkout progress indicators
by hand and we liked it that way.
 Link to shipping information pages. Links to helpful info pages, policy
pages, express shipping options, and international info should open in
pop-ups or new windows to avoid taking the customer out of the check-
out path.
 If you must use coupon codes in your checkout (please don’t), rename
the coupon code field something else (such as Source-code). This way,
the 95 percent of customers who don’t have coupons won’t feel like
they’re getting screwed because they don’t have a coupon. Trust me.
Your conversion rate will thank you.
 Provide links to contact information. Show your 800 number with
phone hours and other contact info. Link to Cart Help pages.
Talk about safety, security, and privacy 
on the Billing Info Checkout page
Tell shoppers that they are on a secure server and that their personal infor-
mation is safe and secure. Assure customers that their satisfaction is com-
pletely guaranteed (if you do that). Display or link to pages with testimonials
from satisfied customers. Here are more ways to make your customer feel
comfortable buying from you:
 Link to other ways to order or pay. Link to a fax or mail-order PDF order
form if you can accept those types of orders.
 Emphasize privacy when you ask for customers’ e-mail. Tell them
you’ll safeguard their personal information, and that you don’t spam.
 Accept a variety of payment methods. Accept four major credit cards
(Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express) plus PayPal, and
show their logos on-site. Consider taking online checks, too. I like to put
a GIF file with these trust symbols in the Variable Final-text field.
Improving Your Store’s Usability
to Increase Conversions
Improving the usability of your Yahoo! Store is one of the most effective
things you can do to increase your conversion rate, and thus your sales.
Achieving this usability includes perhaps boring but definitely important
339
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

stuff such as increasing the load speed of your store; optimizing and reducing
image files to make them load faster; designing your store to display cor-
rectly on the browsers and monitors that the majority of folks visiting your
site are using; writing copy in a Web-friendly style; using established Web-
design conventions; and more.
Web usability isn’t a magic bullet! Just because you make your site easier to
use doesn’t mean that you will sell anything. Shoppers will jump through
hoops of fire and shop in the world’s worst online store if it’s the only place
that sells what they want to buy. The opposite is true, too! If your prices are
too high, your site looks amateurish or shady, your shipping rates and poli-
cies are hard to find or nonexistent, your returns and exchanges policies are
draconian, or you’re selling something that no one wants to buy in the first
place, no matter how much you improve the usability of your site, no one is ever
going to buy from you!
Here are some ways to improve your Yahoo! Store’s usability and (I hope!)
your conversion rate:
 Follow well-established Web-design conventions. Blue underlined links
look like links. Buttons look clickable when they look three-dimensional
and raised off the page. Pages less than 800 pixels wide mean no hori-
zontal scrolling. Intrusive pop-ups get blocked by browsers or run folks
off your site.
 Use better error pages. Make a custom 404 error page that pops up
when a page cannot be found with a site search box, links to popular
pages, and uses a friendly “Whoops! Page not found but it’s not your
fault” tone. (See Chapter 15.)
 Watch others use your site. Find a newbie. Get “civilians” to surf the site
and have a specific tasks such as finding a type of product with a spe-
cific feature, or finding a product that will solve a particular problem
and is priced below a certain point. Watch what users do, not just what
they say — but do get them to verbalize their thought process as they
click around.
 Ask customers for feedback about your site design on your Web site.
Put a Feedback link in the Final-text field.
Understanding how little time you have
Jakob Nielsen (www.useit.com) is best known as the father of Web usability,
which is the study of how people use the Internet and how to make Web sites
easier to use. Nielsen’s research says that you have about 10 seconds before
the average user starts to give up on a slow-loading page and clicks the Back
button. Other research shows that the average dialup user waits an average
of 30 seconds for each new Web page he or she views.
340
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

There’s a big difference between 10 seconds on a super-fast DSL or cable
modem and 10 seconds on a bad dialup connection. Ten seconds on a
modem gets you anywhere from 34K to 50K worth of files, depending on
everything from modem speed to where the files actually are on the Internet.
Ten seconds on a broadband connection gets you anything from 250K on up.
Fortunately, you are probably a typical e-commerce retailer and your target
customer base mirrors most of America, with about half the users on high-
speed Internet connections with DSL or cable modems and the other half on
telephone dialup. This means that some of your users need faster-loading
Web pages than others because the faster your page loads, the more pages
the average visitor will view. The more pages visitors view, the more they
will buy.
A fast-loading Web page is never a bad thing, even if someone is on a high-
speed Internet connection. There is a direct relationship between fast-loading
Web pages and higher conversion rates.
Revving up your site’s load speed
Load speed is the first critical function of your Web site. Remember that if a
page doesn’t load within 10 seconds, it doesn’t matter how cool your site is;
you will lose some customers. One client’s sales jumped up tens of thousands
of dollars the first month after I put his site on a “diet.” I decreased his
thumbnails to make the section pages load faster, and I actually increased the
size of his product images. The slow load was causing customers to bail
before having a chance to order.
Think 50K file as a maximum file size for a Web page and all its elements. This
maximum gives you about 10KB for your HTML file (compressed) and 40K for
images. With a section page, this gives you ten 4KB thumbnails or twenty 2K
thumbnails.
Use HTML or text over graphics. HTML text downloads faster because HTML
code files weigh much, much less than image files, and search engines can read
the text. For example, the headlines created on the Yahoo! Store product pages
are actually images, or pictures of words, not words themselves. These image
files are small but at least ten times the file size of the same text in HTML.
Your biggest problem: Images
Images are the main culprit when it comes to load speed. Here are some solu-
tions to common problems with images:
 Compressing individual image files works wonders. For example, an
uncompressed photograph for a product image can result in an 80K
JPEG file, which is way too big! Compressed, that photo is a 20K file.
341
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

The slightest amount of compression can vastly reduce file sizes, so
make sure that you adjust your compression settings in your graphics
software. I set my JPEG compression to 15 percent, and I reduce my
GIF files to 16 colors with no dithering. Adobe Photoshop and Corel’s
Paint Shop Pro both have compression wizards. You can always use
an online tool such as those found at www.jpegwizard.com or www.
321webmaster.com/optigif.php if you prefer.
 Reduce the number of images on a page to increase load speed. Usually,
the problem with images is that the file size of all the images put together
is too large. The easiest way to speed up image load speed on a Yahoo!
Store is to have fewer items in section pages (up to 20 products per sec-
tion, maximum). For example, 40 thumbnails of product shots on a section
page load very slowly! My average thumbnail icon is usually about 3.5K.
 Use smaller thumbnail images (closer to 45 x 45 pixels than 125 x 125
pixels). In the Store Editor under the Variables settings, change Thumb-
height to 55 and Thumb-width to 55 and click the Update button. Now
see how your thumbnails look by browsing your most popular section
pages.
Multiply the number of thumbnails you have by the Variables Thumb-
height and Thumb-width to get a rough guess at the weight of those
graphic images based upon pixels. For example, if you have 45-x-45-pixel
thumbnails, you can have up to 20 products in a section. Twenty thumb-
nails x 45 pixels x 45 pixels = 40,500 pixels.
 Optimize your Icons for faster-loading thumbnail images. The best
way to reduce the load time of section or category page is to crunch the
stuffing out of a 45-x-45-pixel GIF file. Don’t get stuck with a big, fat 5KB
autogenerated thumbnail. Take that image, compress it to 2 or 3KB, and
upload that to the Icon image property. If you want to get the biggest
bang for your buck, maximize your top 20 section pages.
 Save images in a Web-friendly format and file size. When you create or
edit your images in a graphics program, save photographs as JPEGs and
save graphics such as logos as GIF files. I aim to make any custom icons
(thumbnails) no larger than 2K. Product photos should be less than 30K,
and preferably 20K.
 Formatting images helps. Crop product photos on a white background
to remove white space around the image.
 Recycling images works, too. I’ve been guilty of this: using one logo on
the home page, a slightly different one in the footer of every page, and
yet another version of my logo on my info pages. What a waste of band-
width! Now I use the same logo across the site. When users visit a second
page that contains that logo, the image is already on their hard drive and
it doesn’t have to be downloaded again.
342
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

When you have an image-heavy navigation scheme, remember that these
images have to be downloaded only once. Reuse persistent navigation
and other elements (Search button, Add To Cart button, Info graphic,
and so on) on other pages.
Don’t use big images below the fold. Almost half of Web users won’t
scroll down even on Web pages that are longer than their browsers are
tall. If an image doesn’t show in the first screen shot (above the fold),
then don’t have an image there.
Everything depends on access speed
Speed is everything. Fifteen years ago, I accessed Usenet newsgroups with a
1200/2400-baud modem that let me read the words a letter at a time on the
screen as files downloaded. Ten years ago, 28.8K modems were the standard.
Five years ago, everyone had upgraded to 56K modems, and DSL and cable
were first coming online. Now, half the country is using broadband at home
with speeds anywhere from 256KB to 3 megabits, with folks living in the
boonies (like me) stuck on dialup or satellite. Today, people access the Web
at many, many different speeds.
A user’s Internet access speed determines how long it takes for an HTML
page and all the images and other elements on that page to download and
display in a browser. The faster a user’s Internet access speed, the less time
it takes for a page to load. The faster the load speed of a page, the better the
experience will be for your average shopper. Better shopping experiences
turn into sales. Slow-loading pages are extremely frustrating, and after 10
seconds, most folks give up.
You may have no control over the speed of your visitors’ Internet access, 
but you have total control over the size of your Web pages, how many images
you display on a page, and the file size of each image. If you want to sell to
only 50 percent of the population, don’t worry about the file sizes of your
images and HTML pages. For my part, I’d rather have a shot at every dollar.
Looking at Who’s Looking at You
Read on as I share some demographic information from one of my higher-
traffic Yahoo! Stores. Besides telling you what pages were the most popular,
what keywords converted into sales, and where all this traffic is coming from,
most third-party analytics software also collects demographic information.
This includes the browser, browser version, and monitor resolution settings
of all your visitors.
343
Chapter 21: Converting Browsers into Buyers

Operating system and browser software
Depending on your customer mix, most users (95.5 percent) will be using
some version of Windows. Less than 5 percent will be using a Macintosh or
the Linux operating system. If you sell to early adopters, designers, musi-
cians, or anyone else who fits the Macintosh profile, you need to make sure
that your site looks good on a Mac, too.
You need to know the types of browsers that visitors use to look at your Web
store. Web sites display somewhat differently (and sometimes very differ-
ently) in different browsers. 
Most people surfing the Internet today use Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE).
I prefer Firefox for surfing the Internet, but when I’m building a Yahoo! Store,
I like to see what the vast majority of my customers will see, so I use Internet
Explorer.
Screen resolution in pixels
A Web page of an online catalog is very different from the printed page of the
mail-order catalog. With print, you have absolute control over how the shop-
per sees your catalog page. You make the images and text fill up the page with
a pleasing design. On the Web, you have some control, but visitors will see
different-looking catalogs depending on their browser settings and monitor’s
screen resolution (how many pixels tall and pixels wide a monitor displays).
Most monitors can display multiple settings. The higher the settings, the
smaller everything appears. You’ve probably seen the super-geek’s computer
with a 23-inch monitor whose screen resolution setting is so high that you
can’t read the text, and Web pages appear the size of postage stamps.
In July 2005, the most popular screen resolution on one of my sites was 1,024
x 768 (favored by 54 percent of users). In a very distant second place was
800 x 600 (22 percent). This means that if you design a store that’s around
800 pixels wide (or just a little smaller), it will look good on more than 99 per-
cent of the users looking at your Web site, which is good enough for me!
By default, Yahoo! Stores have an absolute width, meaning that if you’re look-
ing at a 790-pixel-wide store on a 50-inch plasma monitor, it might look a little
small. Most folks don’t surf the Web on a 50-inch plasma monitor but rather
on a regular old CRT monitor set to 1,024 x 768. Make sure that you design
your store to look good on the average shopper’s monitor!

So, how big can your pages be?
There’s a very delicate balancing act between using pretty pictures and
determining how patient visitors can be to wait for images to download.
There are three types of files: the HTML page itself, site-wide navigation/
branding images, and page-specific product images.
You don’t have much control over the file size of your HTML pages. The file
really has to be as big as it needs to be. You can cut down a little on file size
by doing a couple of things: moving some code off the page by externalizing
some files such as JavaScripts, and moving some formatting off the page by
using cascading style sheets (CSS).
Yahoo! seems to be compressing HTML files on its servers. This is a fancy
way to increase the load speed of a page by compressing the HTML file into a
Zip file that the browsers can read. My home page on one site weighed in at
79K, but after I looked at the file with the download speed analysis tool, I
found that it weighed in at just over 55K.
Focus on what makes money
While most of my ad agency–based Web-development friends were mastering
all the ins and outs of the latest version of Flash and Photoshop to make sexy
Web pages, I made the very conscious decision not to. Instead, I focused on
discovering how to make my sites convert better and how to drive more and
more traffic through search-engine marketing to my very profitable, but not
quite as flashy, Web stores.

Free speed test
Use this free speed test on your pages to see
the total load time of any Web page. The Results
page tells you the file size (weight) of all the ele-
ments on the page including scripts and images,
gives you links to them in descending order by
file size, and then gives you some helpful tips
based upon your results. You can find it here:
www.websiteoptimization.com/
services/analyze
It’s fun! Run your competitor’s pages through
the tool either for laughs or a wake-up call,
depending on how fast they are. My top five
competitors’ home pages weighed in at 265K,
252K, 182K, 165K, and 73K. I weighed in at 51K.
Zoom, zoom!

I’ll admit that sometimes I feel as though I’m searching for the magic bullet
for improving my conversion rate. If I could only find that one magical phrase
(100% Satisfaction Guaranteed) that keeps folks from dropping their
Shopping Carts and bailing out of the checkout process, I’d be rich! If it were
only that simple!
The truth is that all these little things add up to increasing your conversion
rate. It’s not just one thing. As you make changes to your store, document what
you do, and make changes slowly to see what the impact is over time. Every
site is different, so techniques that work on one site may not work for another
site. Some changes may decrease sales and conversions, so watch out!

E-Mailing Your Customers
for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
 Exploring e-mail marketing
 Staying away from spam
 Maintaining your e-mail lists
 Keeping your customers’ private information private
 Selling more with effective e-mail newsletters and promotions
E
-mail is the #1 killer app of the Internet. More people use e-mail than
use the Internet for e-commerce, online dating, and reading the news
combined.
Marketing through e-mail is a great way to keep in touch with your customers,
educate them about things they’re interested in, “shake the tree” to get traffic
to your Yahoo! Store, and sell lots of cool stuff.
E-mail marketing is also the easiest way to tick off your customers, get your
domain banned from major service providers, get booted off Yahoo! Merchant
Solutions, and even do some hard time in the big house. You want to be care-
ful before you e-mail thousands of people on your customer list.
In this chapter, I outline the various ways you can use e-mail to communicate
with your customers, talk about dealing with spam, explore managing your
e-mail lists, and touch on creating newsletters to connect with and sell to
your customers and prospects.

Discovering E-Mail Marketing Tools
E-mail is the most popular online activity and one of the most powerful ways
to communicate with your customers. You can use e-mail in several ways to
tap into the power of e-mail marketing:
 E-mails to customers who placed an order, such as:
• Order Confirmation e-mail or Thanks For Your Order message.
• Shipping notification with tracking number and delivery info. You
can send it by hand or use UPS (or another carrier) to automati-
cally notify customers that their orders have shipped.
• Rate This Merchant e-mail sent two weeks after the order was
placed.
• Order Status message (if you use this feature). For example, if an
item is delayed, back-ordered, or being sent in separate boxes, you
can change the status setting on the order and notify the customer
by e-mail.
 Personal replies to questions: You can also shine when folks e-mail you
with questions about products or your shipping policies.
 Viral marketing: Customers can use their e-mail to spread your market-
ing for you (like a virus). You can encourage them to “e-mail this page
(or newsletter) to a friend.”
Thanking customers with e-mails
The main reason I use Yahoo! Store is because it’s so easy. A perfect example
is customer Order Confirmation E-mails. To turn on this feature, just click the
Store Manager’s Shipment & Order Status link, type your e-mail address in
the Order Confirmation E-mail field, click the Update button, and then click
the Publish Order Settings link on the Store Manager page. Order confirmation
e-mails are then automatically sent to customers immediately after they place
their orders. This confirmation also contains additional shipping information,
answers to other frequently asked questions (FAQs), and full customer service
contact information with names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and hours
of operation.
One of the best ways you can reduce your workload is by including
very detailed shipping and customer service information in your Order
Confirmation e-mail. Edit this e-mail on the Store Manager’s Shipment &
Order Status page. Scroll to the Confirmation Email message field, type
or paste your message text, and click the Update button. When the Store
Manager appears, click the Publish Order Settings link to make your change
permanent.

Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Include all the information that folks are most likely to call you about, such as
business hours, shipping schedules, and links to your shipping information
pages and FAQs.
Here’s a pretty good “Thanks for your order!” message:
Thanks for your order! Most orders ship out via UPS the same business day
received. International orders and orders with personalized products may take
a little longer. We will contact you by e-mail if we have any questions regarding
your order, or if there will be a significant delay in processing your order.
Some quantity discounts, free shipping on certain Internet specials, and
shipping costs on international orders may NOT be shown on this copy, but
WILL be reflected on your final invoice. If you have any questions about your
order, comments about our site, or anything else you think we need to know,
please e-mail me at sales@yourdomain.com.
We appreciate your business! Thanks, Owner’s Name
Company Name Customer Service, 1-800-555-1212
I would also recommend including a link to your information page (info.html
page) as well as your FAQ page if you have one. If some products take a certain
amount of time to ship, I try to include that in the availability field, which also
reduces the amount of customer service e-mails and phone calls. About one-
third of the calls we get are “where is my order” (WISMO) calls, but we would
get a lot more if we did not include this information.
One last thing! One of the most important things I believe you can do in your
Order Confirmation e-mail message is to really thank the customer for his
order. Be a bit more personal about it. Set the tone of your relationship with
your customer. Say something like “We appreciate your business. We are a
small business and without customers we wouldn’t be here, so thanks for your
order,” or “Our job is to take care of you. Customer satisfaction is extremely
important to us, and if you have any questions, here is what you can do. . . . ”
Sending Order e-mails
Consider the following tips when sending Order e-mails:
 When the orders have shipped, I send a “Your Order Just Shipped”
e-mail to thank customers again for their orders and to notify them that
the orders are on the way.
 UPS WorldShip software also sends each customer a generic e-mail that
contains her UPS tracking number with links to the UPS Web site for real-
time tracking info and the package’s expected date of delivery.

Chapter 22: E-Mailing Your Customers for Fun and Profit

 When merchants enable the ratings feature in the Store Manager under
Customer Ratings, customers receive an automated Yahoo! Shopping
“Rate This Merchant” e-mail two weeks after placing their order.
Taking advantage of personalized replies
When customers e-mail you directly to ask product questions or query about
the status of their order, you have the opportunity to shine. Here are some
ways you can maximize the personal contact you have with customers via
e-mail:
 Stay on top of your e-mail. Customer service and order inquiries are
extremely time sensitive and usually need an immediate response.
These days, folks expect a reply within hours, if not minutes. The faster
you can jump on a problem, the greater the chance of fixing something
before it spirals out of control.
 Writing and speaking are totally different ways of communicating
information. When people read your e-mail, they can’t hear the inflec-
tions or the pitch in your voice. To avoid coming across as too blunt,
I always turn on my “polite” filter when replying to customer e-mails.
My dad always started his replies with “Thank you for e-mailing Gun Dog
Supply” and then responded to a customer’s e-mail. Whatever your per-
sonal style, remember that while the customer isn’t always right, he is
always the customer. Spelling and punctuation are important, too. If you
can’t spell, run a spell checker before you send your e-mail.
 Be a real person, not a nameless, faceless automaton. Sign your e-mails
with your name, not “yourdomain.com customer service.” I think that
being a small company, where customers can get personalized customer
service from a real person (sometimes even the owner), is an extremely
important advantage when competing with big, impersonal corporations.
 Dress up your signature file. At the bottom of every e-mail that I send is
my signature file (or sig file), which is a text file that lists all my contact
information: my name, phone numbers, mailing address, e-mail addresses,
Web-site URL, and a link to my blog. If I’m promoting anything specifically,
I can promote it in my sig file. You send lots of e-mails on a daily basis, and
most of these folks will eventually need your contact information.
Get the benefit of branding your URL in their brain. Customers can see
“Click here to read my blog” or “Click here to buy my book.”
 Pimp up your reply name. I usually stick my 800 number and URL in
my reply name. Instead of an e-mail saying it’s From: Rob it says From:
Rob Snell, 1-800-332-7601, http://ystore.com, which is usually
a clickable link in most e-mail software. When folks preview my e-mail in
their Inbox, they actually see some, if not all, of my 1-800 number in the
From line, which makes it really easy for folks to call me.
350
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Responding to e-mail addresses
on your Web site
You may notice that all the e-mail addresses you have published on your site
seem to get a lot of spam. If you get much e-mail, you probably have a hard
time picking the wheat from the chaff. Certain e-mails I receive need my
immediate attention, so I use different addresses for different things.
To make sure that the important messages get to the top of your Inbox, use
a different reply address for customers than your generic “contact us” e-mail
address on your Web site. For example, you can make orders@yourdomain.
com the reply address to your Order Confirmation e-mail. That way, you know
that e-mails to that address can be only folks who ordered something who are
asking questions. Note: Make sure that e-mail address appears nowhere else
on your site to reduce the amount of spam you get by 80 or 90 percent.
Referral e-mail marketing
Another way to market yourself via e-mail is to ask your customers to pass
along your info. Tell them to tell their friends! Unfortunately, Yahoo! Store
doesn’t come with a service that allows you to add an E-Mail This Page To A
Friend button. However, many third-party services, such as Constant Contact,
offer this feature. Usually, your bulk e-mail or newsletter service gives you the
code to add this capacity to your Web site. The Constant Contact service is
easy to use, offers a free trial, and has tons of other cool tools you can use to
market to your customers. Take a look at www.constantcontact.com.
Advertising in e-mail newsletters
Buying ads in other folks’ e-mail newsletters is a very cost-effective form of
e-mail marketing. It’s a great way to use e-mail to get access to folks who are
not on your customer list. No matter what your industry, people create
newsletters somewhat related to what you sell, and they’ll let you sponsor
their newsletter. You can actually buy a text ad with a link for $50 on up. Most
ads are sold on a CPM (cost per thousand people) basis.
Create an ad, put a tracking link in the URL, and see whether it converts into
sales. If you get any sales or new customers from it, keep doing it. If not, try
some different ads or offers. If newsletter publishers archive their content on
their Web site, sometimes you get the added bonus of a link to your Yahoo!
Store.
351
Chapter 22: E-Mailing Your Customers for Fun and Profit

Marketing products and services
with autoresponders
Another way to collect e-mail addresses of potential customers is to offer free
reports via e-mail using autoresponders. An autoresponder is an e-mail program
that automatically sends a response when someone e-mails that specific
address. Sometimes a series of messages are sent over several days, and
then the prospect is added to your regular newsletter.
I like using autoresponders because they’re a quick way for folks to get
instant information in exchange for their e-mail address. For more informa-
tion on using autoresponders, visit www.aweber.com, which is my favorite
e-mail vendor.
Marketing in a Spam-Filled World
About a year ago, it looked like the spammers had destroyed e-mail market-
ing, but now it looks like things are actually getting better. The software
people have created better spam filters, Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
have done a better job blocking spammy domains, and now the Feds have
stepped in to try to take down the spammers. Industry initiatives are also
under way to help address the problem of e-mail spoofing and phishing by
verifying the domain name from which the e-mail is sent. Right now, spam-
mers can hide behind fake e-mail addresses.
I am not a lawyer. You need to have your attorney look over how you run
your business and address any of your concerns. Best practices, acceptable
use, terms of service, and laws change every day. By the time you read this
book, everything in this chapter may have changed, but this section is meant
to give you a general idea of what’s considered spamming and what’s not. In
other words, don’t e-mail people who haven’t done business with you or who
ask you not to e-mail them.
The CAN-SPAM Act and you
The CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and
Marketing) Act of 2003 was effective January 2004. The CAN-SPAM Act applies
to American businesses that use e-mail for commercial purposes, spammers,
and those who hire spammers. The CAN-SPAM Act is the federal govern-
ment’s first step dealing with e-mail spam.
352
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Now businesses can send unsolicited commercial e-mail to an e-mail address,
but they have to stop sending e-mails to folks who don’t want it. The law also
created guidelines for marketers, and created consequences for those who
violate the law. The punishments aren’t just a slap on the wrist, either. They
have some teeth, with serious fines and even jail time for violating CAN-
SPAM. Spammers are also liable for civil damages.
The CAN-SPAM Act classifies commercial e-mail into three kinds of messages:
transactional or relationship messages, messages to an opt-in list, and other
types of commercial e-mails:
 Transactional or relationship e-mails include order confirmations,
order status e-mails, and messages to existing customers. Yahoo! Store
Order Confirmations and Order Status messages are not spam because
the customer placed an order and gave you an e-mail address. This
relationship allows you to e-mail him. You can also send newsletters
to the folks that have ordered from your Yahoo! Store before because
you have a prior relationship with them, but an Opt-In approach is
preferred.
 Opt-In List e-mails are messages to folks who gave you permission to
e-mail them. For example, when folks signed up for your newsletter, they
gave you permission to e-mail them. (For more on opting in, see the
nearby sidebar “Opting In, double opting in, and opting out.”)
 Other types of commercial messages include ads, newsletters, or com-
mercial solicitation being sent that don’t qualify as the relationship mes-
sages or opt-in messages. These messages must state that the e-mail is
an ad or a commercial message somewhere in the e-mail.
Here’s what you need to do to comply with CAN-SPAM:
 State somewhere in your commercial e-mails that the e-mail is a com-
mercial message or ad. Just in case someone doesn’t have a prior rela-
tionship with you or doesn’t opt-in, I recommend saying this somewhere
in the footer of the message:
“You are receiving this message with our special offers because you are on
our list of friends and customers. If you don’t want to receive promotional
messages from us, simply give us a holler, and we’ll take you off the list.”
 Include your postal mailing address with all e-mails. It is a good idea to
put this and other contact information, such as links to your Web site, at
the bottom of all your e-mails anyway, but the U.S. government requires
it now.
353
Chapter 22: E-Mailing Your Customers for Fun and Profit

 List clear removal or unsubscribe options in every e-mail. Most bulk or
newsletter e-mail vendors do this for you by attaching an unsubscribe
option at the bottom of all the newsletters. Honor the remove request
within ten business days.
 Live by your privacy policy. If you tell people that you’re not going to
sell, rent, or give away e-mail addresses and personal information that
you collect on the site, then you shouldn’t do it.
 Don’t use misleading From addresses or misleading subject lines in
your e-mails. In other words, your e-mail needs to say that it is from you,
and the subject lines need to be about what the e-mail is about.
Having permission to send commercial e-mail to someone is a privilege. Don’t
abuse it by mailing your list too often. Weekly e-mails are about as often as I
want to get promotional e-mails. Live by your privacy policy or die. If you say
you won’t rent, sell, or even reveal personal information, then don’t.

Opting in, double opting in, and opting out
E-mail marketing is confusing enough as it is, so
I opted to include some information explaining the
ins and outs of opting in and out of e-mail lists.
Opt-in means that a person took action to add
her e-mail address to your list and gave her per-
mission for you to e-mail her. Subscribers (folks
on e-mail lists) can opt-in several ways:
 When they buy something, by checking a
box that says “Yes, I want to receive your
weekly e-mail newsletter with money-saving
coupons” on a form
 When they type their name into an e-mail
newsletter signup form on your Web site
 When they tell someone on the phone that
it’s okay to add them to your e-mail newslet-
ter list
Double opt-inis opt-in with an added hurdle: After
subscribers give you their e-mail address, they
receive a confirmation e-mail to double-check
that they really want to be on your list. If they don’t
reply to that confirmation e-mail, they don’t get
added to your list. Double opt-in actually radically
reduces the number of folks who make it to your
mailing list for several reasons. Some folks
change their mind. Some folks get the e-mail and
never respond to it. Some e-mail confirmations
get caught in spam filters. However, double opt-
in e-mail newsletters virtually guarantee you that
your new subscriber actually owns that e-mail
address, verify that they wanted to receive e-mail
from you, and are a pretty good indicator that
someone is a very qualified prospect.
Opt-out is when you have a customer’s e-mail
address and assume that you have permission
to e-mail him until he tells you otherwise — and
we all know what happens when you assume.
A customer can opt-out by replying to your mail-
ings with a remove request or by using the auto-
matic removal link usually included at the
bottom of automated, bulk e-mail newsletters.
From a permission marketing standpoint, opt-in
and double opt-in are the way to go because
you have the express permission of the cus-
tomer or prospect asking for more e-mails from
you. Opt-out is a little bit spammier.

Yahoo’s take on spam
Yahoo’s Terms of Service require you to follow the Yahoo! Store guidelines,
which are pretty specific about spam. Yahoo! says that you can’t send mass
e-mail to folks who don’t request it; send e-mail with a fake e-mail address;
promote a store with multiple submissions in public forums; use inappropri-
ate links, titles, or descriptions; or use content that doesn’t belong to you.
For more details, see http://store.yahoo.com/guide.html.
If someone is spamming you from a Yahoo! Store, report it here:
http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/sbiz/cgi_abuse.
Managing Your E-Mail Lists
When someone places an order, her name and e-mail address is added to your
Yahoo! Store’s Mailing List database. This database is located under the Mailing
Lists link under Promote on the Store Manager page. From this database, you
can add the new names to different lists (customers, prospects, and so on),
create new mailing lists, add names and e-mail addresses, delete names and
addresses, and export your entire list. Also, you can export these names in a
CSV (comma separated value) text file, which you can use to export the names
to a third-party mailing list, such as Constant Contact or Aweber.
Managing your e-mail list can be complicated. I like to use my Yahoo! Store as
my master list.
Sign ’em up!
How do you get people to sign up for your newsletter? The first thing you can
do is use the Catalog Request form. Yahoo! Store has a catalog request form
that you can use to collect names and e-mails. I personally don’t like this
form because it has many other fields that your customer has to complete,
which makes it a little more difficult to collect the information.
Usually, when you have a third-party bulk e-mail vendor, the vendor gives you
a very simple signup form. We use Bcentral. I’ve had clients who have used
Constant Contact, Relevant Tools, Got Marketing (Yahoo!’s designated part-
ner), Aweber, and Topica. Signup forms are a great way to collect e-mail
addresses from folks who are actually interested in receiving marketing mate-
rials and product information from you. Your bulk e-mail vendor gives you a
snippet of code that allows you to put a signup box or form on any HTML
page. It’s really easy to add that to your Final Text field (under Variables) or
elsewhere on your site.
355
Chapter 22: E-Mailing Your Customers for Fun and Profit

Keep signup forms as simple as possible. I ask for name and e-mail address
only. Make sure that you tell people why they should sign up for your
newsletter (free coupons, product information, reviews, contests, and so on).
I usually emphasize the fact that I never give away, rent, or sell my cus-
tomer’s personal data.
Every week, I take all the new customers and newsletter signups, add them to
the Yahoo! Store list, and then copy the addresses to my Bcentral account. A
mailing list is born!
Weeding your list
When someone asks to be removed from future e-mails, I actually delete his
name twice. I go into the Yahoo! Store and delete his name from the Yahoo!
Store mailing list. I then go into Bcentral and delete his name from that soft-
ware, too, to make sure that we don’t have his e-mail address anywhere
inside our marketing system. The system automatically removes e-mail
addresses that bounce multiple times.
Some folks get e-mails and never read them, never reply, never ask to be
removed, and never order anything again. E-mailing customers is so cheap,
that I just keep on e-mailing these folks, hoping that one day they may order
again. The profit from an average order pays for the cost of sending around
10,000 e-mails, so I’ll e-mail a customer forever on the chance that he might
just order again!
356
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 
Offer free downloads
One way to collect e-mails is to have a free
download in exchange for an e-mail address
via newsletter signup. If I can give away a free
report, free e-book, marketing piece, software
sample, or PDF report, then I’m more likely to
acquire subscribers. This worked really well for
one of my clients, an attorney who specializes
in real estate investing. He has all these free
legal forms you can download. I suggested that
he “charge” an e-mail address as the price for
downloading all these free boilerplate legal
documents. He said that one idea (not really
invented by me) was perhaps the best piece of
marketing advice he ever got because that ten
minutes of conversation exponentially increased
the size of his mailing list. See his site at
www.legalwiz.com.

Crafting Effective E-Commerce
Newsletters
The appearance of e-mail messages is much like Web pages because the pre-
sentation to your subscribers totally depends on what software they’re using
to read their e-mail. Messages read on AOL or Gmail are going to look differ-
ent than e-mail read with Outlook Express, and messages on a PDA are going
to look totally different. You don’t have absolute control over how messages
appear to your customers, but you can do a lot of things to help.
Nowadays, most subscribers’ e-mail software is sophisticated enough to
receive complete Web pages with full HTML, rich with multimedia content. In
the good old days, you didn’t have to worry about how your message was
going to look because we had only text available. Now you have to choose
among sending plain text, HTML-enabled e-mail, or both.
I try to send the simplest e-mails possible. I usually include an image at the
top of the e-mail to look sexy, but I try to make my e-mails as simple as possi-
ble. When you use simple text, you know folks are going to be able to read it.
The more complicated the HTML, the more likely you are to set off spam fil-
ters, and your e-mail will never get opened, much less read or responded to.
With HTML e-mails, most third-party bulk e-mail vendors allow you to have
an alternate message, which usually just consists of a paragraph of simple
text and a link to a page on your Web site, and it appears whenever the full
HTML e-mail doesn’t display.
357
Chapter 22: E-Mailing Your Customers for Fun and Profit
Did you get my e-mail?
You need to make sure that the e-mail you send
actually arrives. The only way I’ve ever been able
to tell for sure is to set up test accounts at Gmail,
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL. If your e-mails
don’t arrive, it may be because your domain is a
blocked domain because you appear on a black-
list. Blacklists are lists of spammers and their
domains compiled by independent third parties.
To be safe, I have several AOL accounts. I want
to see whether AOL subscribers are actually
getting my e-mails and how the e-mail looks in
the different versions of AOL’s e-mail software.
Lots of times, HTML-rich e-mails don’t appear
on AOL. AOL’s e-mail software is a little strange,
and you have to do some things when you send
your e-mail to make sure that it shows up. AOL
is important! Ten percent of the people on any
given mailing list these days seem to be AOL
users. AOL users like to shop online, so you
don’t want to miss out on selling them stuff.

Connecting with your customers 
through a weekly newsletter
Chuck Rosanski’s weekly e-mail newsletter from
Mile High Comics (www.milehighcomics.
com) is the best retailer’s newsletter I’ve run
across in eight years of selling online. Mile High
Comics is the world’s largest comic book retailer
and sells millions of dollars in comics every year.
Here’s why I like it:
 The format is simple HTML, mostly text with a
photo or two. His copywriting isn’t commer-
cial at all, which doesn’t trip off spam filters.
 Chuck’s newsletter is personal and makes
customers feel like they’re part of his family.
Chuck’s writing style is real, down home,
and conversational. I don’t really have the
time, but I want to read it when it comes out.
Every week, you get to find out what Chuck
has been up to this week, and what kind of
crazy deals and specials he’ll have next.
 Chuck has a great “hook.” He travels all
over the world to buy all these huge comic
book collections, so he has to sell his exist-
ing stock at ridiculous prices to be able to
afford to buy the next collection. Every
week, some other group of comics is 20 to
80 percent off retail.
 When he’s not running his comics empire,
he works in his garden and grows organic
produce that he sells at the local farmer’s
market.
Why do I know this? I read his newsletter. I don’t
even really collect comics anymore, but Chuck
still gets my money, usually because I see
something that would make a great present. You
need a cool e-mail newsletter? Subscribe to the
Mile High Comics newsletter to see how it’s
done right!

Getting Down with 
Product Uploads
In This Chapter
 Building a product database CSV upload file
 Uploading thousands of products in minutes
 Rebuilding your store from the ground up
 Exporting your store’s product data with XML files
O
ne of the most powerful tools in your Store Editor toolbox is database
uploads. Both the Store Editor and the Catalog Manager allow you to
upload product databases to build, rebuild, or update your online store. You
can edit your product data offline and then quickly upload the updated infor-
mation for extremely fast and easy Web-store maintenance.
This chapter is about the Store Editor Database Upload feature. Stores using
the Catalog Manager should stay out of the Store Editor and refer to the
Yahoo! Store Help files for more information. If you use the Store Editor, you
should never really use the Catalog Manager to create, edit, and manage your
products. I prefer the Store Editor hands down for store building.
You can use database uploads to manage your store in two ways: You can
update existing products and add new items with load files, or you can com-
pletely rebuild your store from the ground up with a master database file you
build offline. If you’re comfortable with Excel and CSV files, database uploads
are extremely easy. It’s almost like trimming your nose hairs with a Bowie
knife.
In this chapter, I show you how to create a product database, upload it to the
Store Editor’s server, preview the uploaded file to make sure that the data is
correct, update the store with the uploaded file, and publish your changes.

I’ll be very upfront about this. I’m trying to scare you. Newbies do not need to
mess with database uploads. This is my disclaimer: Don’t think about touch-
ing a functioning, money-making Yahoo! Store with database uploads unless
you’re prepared to completely rebuild your store from scratch. If you’re not
comfortable with Microsoft Excel and CSV files, you have some work to do
before you can play with database uploads. Open a second account and play
with a test store.
On the other hand, if you have a new account with no product pages, creating
and uploading a CSV via the database upload functionality is really a no-lose
proposition. There’s no better time to explore the power of database uploads
than on a brand-spanking new store, especially if you have Microsoft Excel
and have your product info in a CSV file.
A Word of Warning
If you think you’re up to the challenge of database uploads, you need to be
aware of the potential consequences. You can do the following:
 Nuke your entire site and overwrite old products with new data. You can
make enough changes that you cannot undo without calling Yahoo! engi-
neers to restore your account from backups.
 Change or corrupt the prebuilt Yahoo! function pages (index, norder,
nsearch, info, and privacypolicy).
 Totally mess up your site’s hierarchy and navigation if you screw up the
Path and Contents fields. You can accidentally create multiple versions
of the same section page, resulting in some products being in the first
section and some in the second section.
 Drop hundreds or thousands of new products on your home page if you
forget to include where the new products are supposed to go.
 Dump the contents of your Clipboard and never know it. Usually things
on your Clipboard are new products not yet available or out-of-stock
products, so you discover that you made this mistake after someone
orders something you can’t sell her. Frustrating!
Think about setting up a test store to practice doing database uploads. It’s
worth the $40 a month when you consider the real cost of accidentally delet-
ing your real store. I mean, how much is your ulcer worth? Master doing data-
base uploads, practice your RTML skills, and try other design tricks behind
closed doors. Train new employees in a safe environment instead of learning
on a live store without a net. I found out more by building new stores from
scratch and blowing things up before the client ever got to see the first demo.
360
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

When you’re playing with your demo account (or a brand new store), you can
totally destroy all the products and sections in a store and use the magic of
the Rebuild button to wipe the slate clean.
This stuff changes from time to time. Read the Help files and be careful!
Introducing Database Uploads
Database uploads make dull, repetitive work easy! Instead of using the Store
Editor to add products, you build a simple database of products in a spread-
sheet and upload store data in a matter of minutes. You can create hundreds or
thousands of products and sections in a single text file. You can also update
existing products and move products around on your store with load files.
Database uploads can only create or update product data (text and numbers)
and don’t allow you to upload graphics like Images, Icons, or Insets. (See
Chapter 8 for info on uploading product images. See Chapter 25 for unofficial,
third-party tools for uploading and downloading other image files.)
You have to be in the Advanced mode of Store Editor to do database uploads.
If you don’t work in Advanced mode, you can’t even see the Database Upload
button, and you have no business playing with database uploads. This fea-
ture is for power users only.
Store Editor database uploads are really pretty straightforward. You create a
product database file that contains product information, such as name, price,
code, and maybe some other fields, too. You save the file as a CSV text file.
You log in to the Store Editor and navigate to the Database Upload page.
The upload is really a two-step process: You upload your CSV, and then, after
you’ve previewed the file, you commit to updating the store. If you make a
mistake, you have a chance to undo your snafu with the Revert function. If
the file looks fine, click the Publish button, which updates the public version
of your store with your changes.
Creating Products with Uploads
You really have to know what you’re doing when you’re working with database
uploads, or you can overwrite your entire store with the click of a button. You
don’t have to have custom programming skills. I teach “civilian” retailers how
to do database uploads all the time. All you really need are basic chops in
Excel.
361
Chapter 23: Getting Down with Product Uploads

The only software you need is a text editor and spreadsheet software like
Microsoft Excel. If I’m not using Excel because the files are really small or
simple, I use Notepad (which comes free with Windows) or UltraEdit-32. You
can download a 30-day free trial of the latter from www.ultraedit.com or
just go ahead and pay the $40 and get the world’s best text editor.
You have to be able to open a file, sort and filter records, use find and replace
to correct data, add and remove text, and export files (or “Save As”) in the
CSV (comma separated variable) format. Knowing how to do triple back flips
with text such as concatenating multiple fields into a single field helps, too!
If you want to tweak your geek chops, check out Microsoft Excel For Dummies,
by Greg Harvey (Wiley Publishing).
Formatting Your Upload Files
The Store Editor accepts database upload files in two formats: CSV text files
and Bar-Delimited files (fields separated by pipes: | ). Bar-Delimited files are
much harder to use, so just don’t!
CSV files are simple text files where the fields are separated by commas and
have no font or color formatting. CSV files are really easy to make in widely
available programs like Notepad or Microsoft Excel. Here’s an example of a
simple CSV database upload file:
Name,Code,Price
iPod,1234,$200
iPod Case,2345,$18
This file creates two orderable products on the home page. All the other fields
are blank or the default. Because there is no ID field, the code generates the ID.
Here are some basic things you need to know about CSV files for Store Editor
uploads:
 The first row of any database upload file is for the field names.
 At a minimum, you need an ID or Code field, and one other field.
 Fields can be in any order.
 Prices can have dollar signs or not.
 Empty database fields are not a problem, but empty lines are a problem.
 The ID and Code fields for each item must be unique.
362
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

 The ID field determines the object-ID. If you don’t have an ID field in an
upload, then the Code field also becomes the ID. Naming products with
the same Codes and IDs is good product management. If your upload file
doesn’t have a Code field or an ID field, the Store Editor randomly gener-
ates an ID, such as gensym-1234.
 You don’t have to upload something to every field, but empty YES/NO
fields (such as Taxable, Orderable, and Leafed) default to Yes unless you
upload something different.
I like to build my files in Microsoft Excel, save them as CSV text files, and close
Excel. I open the CSV file in Notepad to make sure that my file is properly for-
matted. I name my CSV file with the time it was created somewhere in the file-
name so that I can tell which is the latest version. It seems I always have to
tweak my upload files for some reason or another, because I always forget a
field or something or have an error message usually caused by me mistyping
a field name.
Uploading Data in the Right Fields
Here are the various product fields you can upload to a Yahoo! Store using
the database upload functionality:
 Yahoo! Help files say that you can upload the following fields: Abstract,
Availability, Caption, Code, Headline, Label, Name, Options, Orderable,
Path, Price, Sale-price, Ship-weight, and Ypath.
 I upload the ID as a separate column instead of letting the code deter-
mine the ID. I also like to upload Contents fields with a list of object-IDs.
 Yahoo! Help files say that you can’t upload content on section pages, but
I do it all the time. Here’s a two-item load file:
Name,ID,Caption
Section,sample-section,Looking for what’s in this section?
Section,sample-subsection,It might be in this subsection!
Doing Uploads
Doing your first database upload can be very exciting. Instead of uploading
thousands of products with every field imaginable, start small.
Here’s an example of an upload file:
Name,Code,Price,Path
Gadget,1234,$199,Widgets:Gismos
363
Chapter 23: Getting Down with Product Uploads

This file creates a Widgets section page with a Gismos subsection. It also cre-
ates a Gadget product page, which shows up at www.yourdomain.com/
1234.html because the order-ID determines the document name.
The following file adds the Sale-Price to the same product:
Name,Code,Price,Sale-Price,Path
Gadget,1234,$199,$165,Widgets:Gismos
The following file adds a drop-down option menu named Color, where you
can choose Black or Red for the same product:
Name,Code,Price,Sale-Price,Path,Options
Gadget,1234,$199,$165,Widgets:Gismos,Color Black Red
Uploading Data with the 
New Upload button
After you click the New Upload button on the Database Upload page, the New
Upload page appears (see Figure 23-1). Four drop-down menus let you select
a data format (CSV or Bar-Delimited), the item type and template, and the
section type and template. An Upload field with a Browse button lets you
choose the file from your disk and upload your product database file to the
server.

364
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

If you’re not using custom types and templates, just leave everything set to
the defaults (CSV, item., page., item., page.), click the Browse button to select
a file from your computer, and then click the Upload button to upload the file.
For the data format, you can choose either CSV or Bar-Delimited:
 Bar-Delimited is old-school. Think: 1997. Bar-Delimited files have pipes
( | ) delimiting or separating the various fields in your database. Type a
pipe. Look in the upper-right corner of your keyboard. Press Shift+\. I
can’t believe they still allow bar-delimited database uploads, because in
1998, the Viaweb folks started saying they were going to discontinue it
any day now, so I figured out how to do CSV files in Excel.
 CSV (comma separated variable) files are much easier to make using
Microsoft Excel. I talk a lot more about CSV files earlier in this chapter.
If you’re using custom types and templates, select the type and template you
want for this upload, click the Browse button to select a file from your com-
puter, and then click the Upload button to upload the file.
Reviewing your data
No matter whether you’re using the standard or custom types and templates,
the Upload Summary page appears with a Summary, Warnings And Errors,
and View Individual Records fields:
 Summary displays the upload file’s time and date, a list of all the fields
in the file, and a count of how many records are in the upload file. If you
misspelled a field name, it appears here as well.
Check the number of records. If this number is way off, then something’s
wrong with your formatting.
 Warnings And Errors shows you all the records with problems, links to
those individual records, and the corresponding error messages for
each record. Each record that has a problem, such as a blank line or
missing field, appears here.
 View Individual Records starts with the first record of upload. Here you
can jump to any record in the file or use the Next button to page through
individual records. At a minimum, I like to check the first record, a middle
record, and the last record to make sure that I didn’t screw something up.
You need to check your data before you add it to your store or completely
rebuild your store. Start by making sure that your upload file is the right file
type (CSV), is not corrupted (has no garbage characters), has the correct
number of records, has correctly spelled field names, and has the data in the
right fields. After you’re pretty happy with your file, you have to decide how
you want the data added to your Yahoo! Store.
365
Chapter 23: Getting Down with Product Uploads

Updating product data
Store Editor database uploads have two options for updating product data:
Add or Rebuild.
 The Add button creates new products and updates the fields for existing
products.
 The Rebuild button totally deletes all products and sections and literally
rebuilds your store from the ground up (except your prebuilt Yahoo!
function pages, such as index, info, privacypolicy, and so on), which
allows you to wipe the slate clean and upload a brand new store. Be
careful! You can delete your entire store by clicking one button.
Fortunately, Yahoo! gives you an extra chance to cancel before com-
pletely rebuilding your store (see Figure 23-2).
My experience is that Add is better than Rebuild unless you have a com-
pletely new database every time you need to do an upload. I like to be able to
make tons of adjustments and edits in my Store Editor when I want to and not
have to worry about overwriting them with a database upload. Add is good
for this task!

366
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

BobtheJanitor.com is a revenue-share store I manage. Almost once a month,
the product database experiences major changes, such as added or dropped
products, price adjustments, and product availability changes. Instead of
updating each of these products by hand, I use the Rebuild function to
delete all sections and products and rebuild the store with the most current
information.
Rebuild is perfect for sites that receive complete product databases from
third-party vendors. Rebuild also works great for retailers who generate their
Yahoo! Store data from an internal master database file — for example, from
customer service and inventory-tracking software like OrderMotion or Stone
Edge.
Any changes you make to the Store Editor on any page other than the home
page, info page, or Variables is deleted when you click the Rebuild button.
This is extremely dangerous because it is too easy for new users to com-
pletely overwrite their store.
The reason the home page doesn’t get deleted with Rebuild is because the
home page is a Main. type. A cool trick that Luke at Yahoo! Tech Support
taught me a few years back was that you can create pages with Main. as the
type on the Contents page. These new Main. pages survive a Rebuild because
the Store Editor thinks that they’re the home page.
Revert button
If you accidentally delete something important while updating your store,
you can try the Revert button. The Revert button reverts all your products
and sections to the way they were before you did the last upload and
add/rebuild. Revert also has a great warning message: “Revert will restore
your items to the state before your last upload Add or Rebuild. Are you sure
you want to Revert?”
You only have one chance to use Revert to undo your last upload. If you upload
a database (for example, rebuild205am.csv), rebuild your store (which
deletes everything and rebuilds your store using the file rebuild205am.
csv), decide that’s not right and upload another database (for example,
rebuild217am.csv), and press the Rebuild button again, pressing the Revert
button reverts your data back only to your first mistake (rebuild205am.
csv); the Revert button doesn’t work after that.
The Revert button reverts only your product data or objects (products/
sections) back to how they were before you clicked the Add or Rebuild button.
It doesn’t restore changes to Variables, templates, types, or anything else.
367
Chapter 23: Getting Down with Product Uploads

The worst thing that could happen is that you do two uploads, realize that
you’ve made a tragic mistake, and now you can’t go back two steps.
When you really screw up . . .
If Revert doesn’t fix your problem, the only thing you can do is contact Yahoo!
Store Technical Support and beg the folks to restore your data. They really
don’t like to do this task, because it involves pulling the data tapes from the
last 36 hours of backup files and choosing the most current version — and
even then, you still lose hours and hours of work. Unfortunately, Yahoo! can’t
press a magic button and have your Store Editor magically transformed to
match the published version of your store.
I’ve only had to go to the backup one time, and that was in 1999 when Mom
deleted a redundant site map page, which deleted every single category and
product on the site. Man, she freaked! Getting the site restored almost
instantly involved much groveling and bribery including a huge overnight
shipment of Mom’s famous homemade chocolate chip cookies for the Yahoo!
Sales and Tech Support folks, but mostly for Dave Greten, the engineer who
saved the day!
Troubleshooting Database Uploads
Performing Yahoo! Store database uploads is like shaving with a chain saw!
It’s very effective and powerful, but the slightest wrong move and you have a
real problem on your hands! You can totally gum up your site hierarchy with
database uploads, dump tons of items on the home page with no path infor-
mation, fragment your site, and create multiple versions of section pages
where some products are on the original section page and the rest are on the
alternate section pages, and even worse.
Here’s a cool trick: I like to make the first column and the last column in an
upload file the ID field. As long as the data in both columns is exactly the
same, the file is fine, and it’s a good way to make sure that every record in
your file has the correct number of fields.
Here are a few more things you need to know about database uploads:
 “Unknown field will not be used” means you have a typo in your field
names. Don’t Add or Rebuild; just fix the field name, save the file, and 
re-upload the file.
368
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

 When you upload a CSV file, you also dump the contents of the
Clipboard to the site. They may be orphaned items, but you can find
them with site search. Before doing an upload, I make a temporary sec-
tion on the home page called storeroom. I paste all the objects on the
Clipboard into the storeroom section. I upload my product database
and then cut the storeroom section to the Clipboard.
 If you accidentally use the same ID for a new product that you were
using on an old product, you create a Frankenstein’s monster of a
product. Your upload adds the new information to the old product, thus
screwing up two items. The old product has some data from the new
product, but will probably have the old product’s picture and be in the
old product section. Make sure that you use unique IDs. If you have a big
site, with tens of thousands of items, sometimes weeks or months can
pass before you figure out what happened.
 You can accidentally change the templates on Yahoo! function pages:
index, info, norder, privacypolicy, ind, and so on. Be careful when
creating a product upload database. Make sure that you don’t have any
objects in the file that you don’t want to create or update. Several third-
party sites take the XML feed of all your sections and products and turn
this information into a CSV file.
These files sometimes include the object IDs of the Yahoo! Store Editor
prebuilt function pages: your home page (index), your info page (info),
your alphabetical index (ind), your search page (nsearch), your privacy
policy page (privacypolicy), and your Shopping Cart (norder).
When you do a database upload, you specify the type and template of
each object-ID in your file. The defaults are “item.” for type and “page.”
for template. Remember, you can’t change the type of an object, only the
template. Each of these prebuilt function pages uses separate templates
and is made of separate types. If you do a database upload for these
object-IDs, you change the template to whatever you specify, before
you upload your file, which can really mess up your info and index
pages. It’s easy enough to change these back to the correct template
by editing each function page, but you shouldn’t upload these object
IDs in the first place!

 Pointing domains at the right place
 Managing and protecting your domains
C
hoosing your domain name or dot-com address is one of the most
important Internet marketing decisions you’ll make. When you open
your Yahoo! Store/Merchant Solutions account, you start by either registering
a brand new domain or pointing another domain you already own to your
new Yahoo! Merchant Solutions account.
Domains are serious business, too. Anytime you make changes to your domain
setup, a bone-headed mistake, a technical glitch, or even a bureaucratic snafu
can take your Yahoo! Store offline. Horrors! It’s not as scary as it sounds,
though. You just need to pay very close attention when messing with your
domains. Think of managing your domain like you’re changing a fuse in a
fuse box.
In this chapter, I talk about what you need to know about domains, how to
choose a good domain name, how to decide whether to point a domain name
to your store or to your hosting account, and other stuff. If you’re already
master of your domain, use this chapter as reference when you need it and
skip ahead. It’s a Dummies book!
Exploring Your Domain
Your domain name is the foundation of your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions
account, as well as the center of your Internet marketing universe. You must
have a domain name or register a new domain to open a new account with
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions.

A domain name is simply your dot-com, the unique address on the Web that
points to your Yahoo! Store or Web site. Your domain is your URL (Uniform
Resource Locator or address of something on the Internet). When someone
types your domain into his Web browser, that address can only point to one
place: your Yahoo! Store. A domain name is a lot like a phone number, and
having a great one is a very good thing.
Registering Your Domain Name
When you want to get a domain name, you just go to a registrar, a company
licensed by ICANN (the official licensing body of the Internet) to register and
manage domain names, to see whether the domain you want is available,
select a domain, agree to lots of terms and conditions, fill out a form, and
then pay the registrar around ten bucks to reserve that domain name for
the next year.
Do us both a favor and use one company to register all your domain names.
There are too many passwords and logins these days as it is!
Here are a few tips to remember when registering your domain:
 When registering your main domain, go ahead and pay to reserve
your domain for as long as you can (think five to ten years). That
way, you don’t have to think about reregistering it for a long period
of time.
 Make sure that your contact information has an e-mail address that
you’ll be using for a long time. Use a permanent mailing address,
perhaps your parents’ address or a permanent P.O. box. See the
nearby sidebar “Don’t panic: Changing your domain info” for good
reasons why.
 Have separate e-mail and mailing addresses for your administrative,
technical, and billing contacts. That way, when you have trouble, some-
one from the registrar will be able to reach you or someone working
with you.
 Make sure that you keep your contact information current when you
change e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, or phone numbers. ICANN
requires that your data be correct. Domains with false information can be
taken away.
 If you’re buying multiple domains, do yourself a favor and use the
same registrar. It makes keeping up with your domains a little easier.

Registering domains with Yahoo!
When you create your Merchant Solutions account and you sign up for a
brand new unregistered domain name, Yahoo! registers your domain with one
of its partner registrars, but you manage all the details through your Yahoo!
account. Very convenient! Yahoo! says the domain registration is free, but
you’re paying enough in your monthly hosting bill (which runs anywhere
from $11.95 to $300 a month, depending on the package you buy) to more
than cover the annual cost (around $10) of your domain registration fee.
The only downside to registering through Yahoo! is that after you’ve opened
your account, the domain is welded to your Merchant Solutions account so
that you can’t register the same domain multiple years in advance. Yahoo!
automatically renews your domain every year unless you close your account,
which makes you responsible for reregistering your domain with its registrar.
Registering domains with other companies
A few years back before domain names became a commodity item, Yahoo! was
charging full retail (around $35 a year) for registering domain names, so I used
GoDaddy.com as my registrar of choice. Now I keep using GoDaddy.com for its
great technical support. The folks at GoDaddy.com don’t outsource their tech
support phone calls to an offshore phone bank, and the friendly, knowledge-
able folks understand that you probably don’t have a computer science degree
from MIT. They don’t even make fun of me when I can’t figure out which button
to click to make the simplest changes or when I forget my customer ID, login,
and password. GoDaddy.com also has great TV commercials.
373
Chapter 24: Mastering Domains
Don’t panic: Changing your domain info
In 1997, I registered a domain for the next eight
years. The contact information was my
CompuServe e-mail address and parents’ mail-
ing address. Fast-forward to 2004, and it was
the first time I needed to make a change to my
domain. By then, my parents had moved, their
area code had changed, and that e-mail
address hadn’t been good for five or six years.
It is a major pain to get your domain information
changed, but it’s doable. Depending on your
registrar, you fax in a statement on company let-
terhead with a photocopy of your driver’s
license and a legal statement saying that you’re
the rightful owner of that domain. Unless some-
one contests it, the registrar will give you
access to your domain, usually the same day
you fax in your information. Remember that
you’re signing a legal affidavit, so no monkey
business!

When you use a different registrar than Yahoo!, there’s a little more work
involved in creating and maintaining your account. You have to log in to
your account at that registrar’s Web site to point your domain to Yahoo!’s
nameservers (yns1.yahoo.com and yns2.yahoo.com), which causes
your Web site or Yahoo! Store to appear when people type your domain
name. You also have to use the registrar’s Web site to make changes to
your contact information and to renew your domain. It’s not as convenient
as using http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains, but for me, it’s
too late!
GoDaddy.com charges only $8.95 a year to register a domain, but watch out
for all the add-on stuff in the checkout process. GoDaddy is very good at
upselling in its shopping cart and checkout (so take notes!) and tries to sell
you services that you really don’t need, such as e-mail, Web hosting, market-
ing software, clip art, and so on.
Non-Yahoo! registered domains and DNSs
When you already have your domain registered with a different registrar,
Yahoo! makes it easy to sign up. Just click the link next to Already Have A
Domain Name? Use It With A Yahoo! Plan. After signing up for your Yahoo!
account, you have to go to your registrar and point your domain name
servers (DNSs) to the Yahoo! Store Name Servers. The Yahoo! Store Name
Servers are the following: yns1.yahoo.com and yns2.yahoo.com.
It’s pretty easy to log in to your account at the registrar, change your DNS
settings, and save your changes. Usually within 24 to 48 hours, your domain
name will be working. Every registrar is slightly different, so check with
technical support if you have any questions.
Mastering Your Domains
Yahoo! makes setting up and making changes to your domain settings easy.
When you log in to Yahoo at http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
services, you’re one click away from your Domain Control Panel, shown
in Figure 24-1. In the Domain Control Panel, you can manage your domain
and subdomains, edit your Domain Registration Information (WHOIS),
and work with your Advanced DNS settings, which you’ll probably never
touch.

Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Determining your site entry point
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions is two, two, two stores in one! You have pages you
build in the Store Editor and pages you build offline and upload and host in
your Web-hosting account. By default, www.yourdomain.com points to your
Web-hosting account, and http://store.yourdomain.com points to the
Store Editor–built pages. Having two different ways to build stores is very
confusing to folks. It’s even confusing for developers! If you’re old school like
I am, the Store Editor is fine. (See Chapter 5 for more information, where I talk
a lot more about the Editor versus Web hosting and Store Tags.)
Figure 24-2 shows where you change your site entry point (where the
www.yourdomain.com URL points). You have to decide whether you want
your site entry point to be your Store Editor–built pages or pages hosted in
your Web-hosting account.
Figure 24-2:

Chapter 24: Mastering Domains

What this decision really means is “Do you want the front door to be the main
entryway to your store, or do you want to go ahead and make that side door
that everyone is really going to use the main entrance?”
If you use Editor, make it the site entry point. If not, leave well enough alone.
(If you don’t use Editor, you probably bought the wrong book, but hopefully
you’ll get your $24.95’s worth in marketing and other advice!)
To fix (okay, change) your site entry point, you need to log in to your store
and follow these steps:
1. Click the Domain Control Panel link on your Manage My Services page.
Your Domain Control Panel appears (refer to Figure 24-1).
2. Click the Manage Domain & Subdomains link.
You see a table that lists your domain and address and shows the desti-
nation My Web Hosting Site. This destination is what you want to
change.
3. Click the Edit link.
The Edit Your Domain Name Destination page appears.
4. Read all the notes and warnings.
If you disagree with anything, defer to Yahoo!’s expertise and call tech
support at 1-866-800-8092.
You see two radio buttons. Right now, it says Keep The Current
Destination As My Web Hosting Home Page.
5. Select the Change The Destination To My Store Editor Homepage
radio button, scroll to the bottom, and click the Submit button.
You return to the Manage Domain & Subdomains page, where the
Destination should show My Store Pages.
For those of you who are familiar with traditional Web hosting, all
the pages, images, and other files you upload to your Yahoo! Web-
Hosting account will be located in the subdomain site http://site.
yourdomain.com. All the pages built in the Store Editor will be inside
www.yourdomain.com. It takes a little while for Yahoo! to figure out
where to point your Web store.
6. Type your domain name in your browser.
If it’s a new domain hosted by Yahoo!, you see a page that says “This site
is under construction” until it points to your Store Editor home page.
376
Part V: Making More Money with Your Yahoo! Store 

Redirecting store URLs to your domain
Search engines don’t like mirror sites (when the same content or the same
Web site exists in multiple places on the Web) because duplicate content fills
up their index with redundant Web pages. If spammers thought they’d profit
from it and could get away with it, they’d crank out thousands of copies of
their Web sites.
Google is very good at picking out dupes and has a pretty harsh duplicate
content filter, which figures out which is the main site and then nukes all the
duplicate pages.
One of the problems that Yahoo! Stores have traditionally had is that multiple
URLs point to the exact same page. Search engines see this one page with mul-
tiple addresses as completely separate Web sites. You see how this can be a
problem: There’s really one page on a Yahoo! Store, but all these URLs point
to it: http://store.yahoo.com/youraccountname, www.yourdomain.
com, http://stores.yahoo.com/youraccountname, http://
youraccountname.store.yahoo.com, http://youraccountname.
stores.yahoo.com, http://youraccountname.shopping.store.
yahoo.com, and several other URLs. It looks like you’re spamming their
index with multiple copies of the same site. Google’s pretty good about
figuring out which site is the real site, but Yahoo!’s search engine and MSN
Search both index and list all the URLs.
To fix most of this problem, Yahoo! added a feature to automatically redirect
store URLs to domain URLs using a permanent 301 redirect. SEO guru Greg
Boser (of Webguerrilla.com) says that a 301 redirect is just like a change-
of-address form to a search engine, which says that the page at this old
Web address moved to this new Web address. Don’t worry about what a
301 redirect does in technical terms; just consider using 301’s good manners
for search engines. Your store pages show up in the search engines, and all
the back links (links back from other pages to your store) still count for link
popularity. (I discuss back links, link popularity, and other lucrative geeky
topics in Chapter 19.)
Always have links to your store point to one consistent URL so that your site’s
link popularity (“votes” from other pages) counts for the same “candidate”
page. For example, any links to your home page should point to the URL
http://www.yourdomain.com/ (with the www). Also, links to any interior
pages should point to http://www.yourdomain.com/pagename.html to
maximize link popularity. Search engines see www.yourdomain.com and
http://yourdomain.com (without the www) as two separate pages, so any
link popularity is split between the two.
377
Chapter 24: Mastering Domains

Here’s how to turn on the 301 Change Of Address Form inside your Store
Manager:
1. Click the Domain Names link under Site Settings on your Store
Manager.
Yahoo! Store most likely asks you for your security key, which is your
second-level password for scary things such as changing your credit
billing information or seeing customer orders. If you haven’t created
your security key, you’re going to have to create one. I detail all the
information about the security key in Chapter 3. Yahoo! is very good
about not allowing authorized people to make changes to your store.
2. Type your security key and click the Continue button.
The Domain Name Management page appears. You can add host names,
as well as adjust your Yahoo Domain Redirect Settings on this page. When
you first open a Merchant Solutions Account, all your published editor
pages are on the Yahoo! Domain URLs http://store.yahoo.com/
yhst-youraccountnamehere, as well as the subdomain http://
store.yourdomain.com. That’s what you don’t want.
3. Select www.yourdomain.com from the pull-down menu and click the
Set Redirect button.
After you select this setting, you should never need to change it again.
Your Domain Name Management Confirmation page is where Yahoo! help-
fully explains “You have selected to redirect all Yahoo! Store generated
URLs to www.yourdomain.com” and shows you a list of all the duplicate
URLs now redirected to your domain. The redirect takes effect usually
within a day or so. For example, after it is activated, when someone goes
to my http://store.yahoo.com/yhst-17192271484370 page,
Yahoo! instantly 301s (or redirects) her to www.ystorebooks.com,
which is my Store Editor–built home page. Pretty cool, Yahoo!

his part of the book is The Part of Tens, a Dummies
book tradition where every chapter is a list of ten
things. In The Part of Tens, I cover the ten types of tools
I use on a daily basis and tell you ten times why you
should turn to RTML.
When you’re building and managing your Yahoo! Store,
you have to have the right tool for the right job. In this
part, I list ten types of tools I can’t live without (with
examples!), including keyword-research programs, search-
marketing tools, store-backup software, additional Web
analytics, helpful utilities, and graphics software.
I also introduce you to RTML, the proprietary template
scripting language you can use to customize stores built
in the Store Editor. You discover the basic concepts of
RTML and all the cool things that you can do (or pay
someone to do) with RTML.

In This Chapter
 Looking for more keywords
 Tinkering with tools
 Utilizing helpful utilities
I
n this chapter, I give you ten or so types of tools you need to run your
Yahoo! Store and list the specific tools I use and recommend. Enjoy!
Searching for All the Right Words
(See Chapter 16 for a whole chapter on keywords and their importance to
your Yahoo! Store’s success.) Your Yahoo! Store References can tell you what
keywords are currently driving your traffic and sales, but you need to know
all the popular keywords in your market so that you can optimize your site
for search engines (see Chapter 19) and buy the words in paid-search ad
campaigns (see Chapter 18). Enter keyword research tools!
Wordtracker is my favorite commercial keyword tool. Type a general keyword,
and Wordtracker shows you how many people searched for that query in the
last 60 days and gives you a list of all the other phrases containing your key-
word query. Check out the free trial at www.wordtracker.com, where you
can sign up for a year’s subscription for around $250.
Keyword Discovery from Trellian is my new keyword tool of choice, generat-
ing even more keywords per search than Wordtracker. The Trellian folks live
in Australia and, besides making some cool SEO and keyword-research tools,
are also very successful sheep farmers. They’ll happily share SEO secrets or
how to deal with your wombat problem, but whatever you do, don’t ask them
to share their sheep. Visit www.trellian.com, where you can get Keyword
Discovery from only $32.50 a month.

Searching Engine Queries/Filters
Search engines are pretty good at finding what you’re looking for, but search
results can only be as good as the searcher’s query. Power users can use
these queries and filters to see how many pages they have in the engines and
who links to them and then use these tools to do a little recon on the compe-
tition. (Find more about what you’re searching for in Chapter 19.) You can
use many advanced search filters and advanced operators to do super-
focused surgical strike–style searches on the various search engines and
their indices, but here are my favorites:
 Search for site:YourDomain.com on Google, Yahoo!, or MSN to see
whether a site is indexed in a particular engine and to see how many
pages are in the index.
 Search for link:http://www.YourDomain.com on Google, Yahoo!, or
MSN for a list of pages that link back to a specific URL or domain. I like
to do the link: query for specific pages, not just home pages, to see
which interior pages have external links.
 Search for intitle: keyword phrase on Google or Yahoo! to see only the
pages that contain that keyword phrase inside the Title tag. This is a
great way to see how many pages are really optimized for a given key-
word phrase.
 Search for inurl: keyword phrase on Google or Yahoo! to see only the
pages with that specific keyword phrase in the URL.
 See Google’s page listing all their advanced operators at http://www.
google.com/help/operators.html

Using the Right YstoreTool for the Job
YstoreTools.com, an independent, third-party software site, offers tools that
make creating and managing your online store easier. Get the right tool for
the right job. Programmer/developer Don Cole has created a whole suite of
software tools and services available for the Yahoo! Store owner, including
Graphic Downloader, Graphic Uploader, Order Checker, Order Processor, and
the famous RTML Transfer Utility. Yahoo! Store Backup & Feed is Don’s rela-
tively new monthly service where he converts your Yahoo! Store product

data into files you can upload to almost any other shopping site or engine,
including eBay, Amazon, Yahoo! Shopping, Froogle, and about 20 other major
online shopping portals. See www.ystoreservices.com for more info.
Exporting Your Yahoo! Store
Yahoo! Store Export Tool, from David Burke’s VisualFuture.com, is one tool I
cannot live without! Export your entire store with the click of a button. Visit
www.visualfuture.com for access to this free service. Chapter 15 has
more information about enabling the XML export of your store’s items and
sections.
Checking Your Web Position
SEOToolSet is SEO guru Bruce Clay’s suite of online search-engine tools for
tracking, analyzing, improving, and optimizing your Web pages for the best
search-engine ranking results. Track your position on the top engines for up
to 200 keywords. Reverse-engineer SEO secrets of pages that outrank you
for any given keyword phrase. Keep up with who links to you and figure out
who links to your competition. It’s available at www.seotoolset.com and
www.bruceclay.com for $99 a quarter.
Webposition is a similar Web position tracking application, except it runs
from your desktop. I use it for larger lists of keywords. Available at www.
webposition.com with a free demo, the standard edition is $149 and the
Pro Edition is $389.
Tracking Trends with Analytics Software
As I discuss in Chapter 20, Yahoo! Statistics are pretty good, but if you want
to really know your visitors’ every move on your Web site, you need some
additional software. ClickTracks Pro Hosted rocks! John Marshall and the
ClickTracks crew have always had user-friendly Web analytics software, but
they went the extra mile to make their software Yahoo! Store compatible. See
which keywords on which engines generate traffic and sales with custom ROI
analysis. I love ClickTracks’ visual interface that maps visitor behavior over a
copy of your Web store so that you can see what navigational elements work
to drive traffic and sales. Now the new version (ClickTracks Pro 6.0) has built-
in A/B testing. I can’t wait to try out the new version, which is available at
www.clicktracks.com starting at $179 per month.

Chapter 25: Ten or So Tools of the Trade

EngineReady is another Web analytics software package I use to track which
keywords are driving traffic and sales. My favorite feature is a daily e-mail
containing an Excel file of my converting keywords from the previous day.
Available at www.engineready.com, it starts at $49.95 per month for up to
50,000 page views. Tell Justin I said howdy!
Checking Out Other Cool Tools
Wow! I almost ran out of room. Domain tools I like using are DNSStuff.com,
Whois.sc, and Godaddy.com’s DomainsbyProxy. For customer service and
inventory management, take a look at StoneEdge.com or OrderMotion.com.
Not only am I a slow typist, but I also edit while I type, so I’m extremely slow
at typing, but get me running my mouth, and I can talk a bookload! This For
Dummies manuscript is brought to you by Dragon Naturally Speaking. You
talk, and it types.
Google Tools I use almost every day: Gmail gives me access to my e-mail from
anywhere I have Internet access. Searching your e-mail instead of sorting is
great if you don’t mind the ads. Google Alerts is great for news and searches
to alert you of new pages in the search engine. The Google Toolbar lets you
search from your browser as well as see information about sites you visit.
Google Desktop Search organizes files on your personal computer and makes
finding files almost as easy as searching on Google.
Finally, don’t forget http://my.yahoo.com for your Yahoo! calendar, orga-
nizing RSS feeds for keeping up with blogs, and news, too.

Ten or So RTML Resources
and Recommendations
In This Chapter
 Dipping your toe into RTML
 Navigating the possibilities of RTML
R
TML is the proprietary template scripting language that the Store Editor
uses to generate HTML pages for products, sections, and other pages.
RTML is extremely powerful and is able to do things that regular old HTML
just can’t do. For example, RTML pages can know where a product is inside
the store’s hierarchy or display information on a Web page that’s stored
inside another page.
Don’t be scared of RTML! Some folks are extremely intimidated by RTML and
avoid it, but the reality is that your store already uses RTML. Every time you
click the Publish button, the prebuilt templates create static HTML pages
based upon settings you control on the Store Editor’s Variables page (and a
few other places). Yahoo! provides no tech support for RTML, and the official
documentation just whets your appetite for modifying templates, but isn’t
enough to get you started. Also, be aware that when some tech support folks
see custom or modified RTML templates, they use that to punt on the easiest
support questions.
Most retailers don’t need to know how to program RTML. Unless you’re going
to develop Yahoo! Stores for a living, it’s probably not worth learning the RTML
operators and syntax, but any retailer can benefit from knowing what RTML
can do. It’s much easier to hire a developer and know that you’re paying a fair
price for custom templates or RTML modifications when you know just a little
about RTML. That’s why I’m giving you ten or so RTML recommendations and
RTML resources you should check out.

Know HTML before Playing with RTML
Much of RTML is based upon regular HTML, so before you dive in to modifying
or customizing templates, you must be familiar with basic HTML, especially
table tags. I recommend HTML 4 For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley Publishing),
by Ed Tittel and Mary Burmeister.
Experiment with RTML
There’s a big difference between modifying copies of RTML templates (pretty
easy), customizing copies of RTML templates (more complicated), and creating
new RTML templates from scratch (you’d better know exactly what you’re
doing). The best way to understand RTML is to dive in and start playing with
copies of the prebuilt templates. Also, make new templates from scratch to
discover how operators work with simple examples. Finally, beg, borrow, or
buy someone else’s RTML templates so that you can reverse-engineer how she
did something. If you’re going to experiment with RTML, invest $40 a month to
get a second Yahoo! Store for testing so that you can play with RTML and not
worry about blowing up your real store.
Read Mike’s Books on RTML
This section is going to sound like an ad for my good friend (and this book’s
technical reviewer) Michael Whitaker, but I’m not getting paid for it, and it’s a
great resource, so take a look at it. Mike’s first book, RTML for Yahoo! Store —
A visual quick-start tutorial to modifying templates (Monitus), is a perfect entry-
level how-to guide for playing around with RTML, as well as a great brushup
for more advanced users. He shows you exactly how to do many RTML modifi-
cations that folks want to do on their stores, including adding a search box to
every page on your store, modifying your site’s navigation, and using a custom
image button for your Add To Cart button. See www.monitus.com/ebook.
htm and www.ystore101.com for more information.
Mike’s new book, Yahoo! Store Tips & Tricks (Ytimes Publications), just came
out and is cowritten with Istvan Siposs. Read that one, too. It’s got tons of
really specific tips for Yahoo! Store owners, with some useful advice even if
you never touch RTML, so take a look at it. He and Istvan have a series of very
educational Yahoo! Store training seminars where I’ve been a guest lecturer on
marketing. See http://ytimes.info/yahoo-store-tips-and-tricks.
html for more on this book.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Read Istvan’s Books on RTML
RTML guru Istvan Siposs knows more about RTML than anyone I’ve ever met.
I was blown away when he told me he reverse-engineered everything he knows
about RTML simply by experimenting with the prebuilt templates in the Store
Editor. Holy cow!
Unfortunately, I doubt there will ever be an RTML For Dummies book because
there might be 500 people who would buy it. Fortunately for you and me,
Istvan has written and published multiple books on RTML, including RTML
101: The Unofficial Guide To Yahoo! Store Templates, Custom Templates
NOW! (e-book), Deconstructing Y-Times (e-book), and Yahoo! Store Template
Reference (e-book), all published by Ytimes Publications. Visit his Yahoo!
Store at http://Ytimes.info and check out his stuff!
Use Don Cole’s Template Transfer Utility
Don Cole is one of my heroes. He’s a programmer, store developer, and all-
around nice guy. Not only does he develop these incredibly cool Y!Store tools
(www.ystoretools.com), but he also makes them available to other devel-
opers and the general public at extremely reasonable prices. Don even has a
free RTML Transfer Utility template upload tool that you can use to down-
load, archive, modify, and upload your custom RTML templates. You can
download templates at no charge, and he only charges you $1 (or less when
you buy upload credits in bulk) for every RTML template you upload. If you
have ever hand-built templates using the RTML Stack Editor, you’d probably
pay $20 per template to never do that again.
Don’s template upload tool saves your custom RTML in text files that you can
edit with any text editor (like Notepad) or even Microsoft Excel. Even if you
don’t code your own RTML, you can download and back up your templates
and sleep better at night knowing that you have the blueprints to your store
design safely tucked away.
Read the YstoreForums.com RTML forum
Lots of developers and power users hang out at Don Cole’s Yahoo! Store
forum (www.ystoreforums.com), and you can gain a lot of knowledge by
reading it. Ask seasoned development pros your RTML questions in the
RTML General Questions & Information forum at www.ystoretools.com/
forums/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=17.

Chapter 26: Ten or So RTML Resources and Recommendations

Look at Lots of Custom RTML Stores
One of the best things you can do is look at as many custom-built RTML
stores and make a list of the features you like and want on your store. Most
stores have similar needs (text link navigation, breadcrumbs, SEO modifica-
tions, related items, and so on), so lots of “custom” stores look very, very
similar. Look, the last thing you want to do is pay $2,500 and get a cookie-
cutter template that took an hour for some guy to tweak and upload.
Search on Google or Yahoo for RTML Yahoo -telescope, and you get a list of
around 400 sites that mention both Yahoo! and RTML. RTML also stands for
remote telescope markup language, so the -telescope removes those pages. I
found around 389 sites mentioning RTML and Yahoo! (and not telescopes!) on
Google. Look at the portfolio pages of developers listed in the top 30 sites,
and you’ll have a very good idea of what you can do with RTML.
Add Missing SEO Elements
RTML is perfect for adding a few missing search-engine-friendly elements to
a copy of the (Page.) template. I customize my copies of RTML templates
to beef up my title tag, add a unique meta keywords tag (for each page),
create a unique meta description, change the headline from an image to <H1>
tags, add the name at the bottom of the page in a page summary, link to the
next item within a section (with the name of the next item) to get the benefit
of the anchor text, link up to the previous section, create an SEO-friendly site
map, and lots of other things — but I’ve been sworn to secrecy and cannot
reveal them in print! If you can do it with text, you can do it with RTML.
Add RTML Navigational Elements
RTML is a great way to add more navigational elements to your Yahoo! Store.
The easiest elements to add are breadcrumbs, those navigational You Are
Here links, because Yahoo! Store has a hidden breadcrumbs RTML template
(Walk-up.) already built. I also like to add Previous/Up/Next links, a Browse
Next Item: Name of Item link at the bottom of every product page, and some-
times related products links to all the other items in the same section.
