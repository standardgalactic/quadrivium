Preface
The amount of money made from websites depends on how we can effectively manage and
optimize the advertisements. We can't just randomly add a bunch of banners to our websites
and wait for them to make money in an optimized way.
Professional advertising management needs more functions. We should be tracking how
advertisements perform and ensure that they are able to customize according to several
visitor parameters such as geographic location. The advertisements shown to website visitors
should be as relevant as they can be, according to the content of the web pages. We need 
a scalable-and easy–to-use ad server that is able to handle hundreds of campaigns at the
same time on multiple websites, if necessary. It should be very easy to replace a banner on
multiple websites with just a few clicks.
Most advertisers want to track how their advertisements perform and are able to make
several changes to ongoing campaign banners at any time. A professional ad server should
also provide such data-sharing capability to advertisers as well.
OpenX Ad Server is designed to provide these functions and much more.
OpenX is currently the market leader in the open source advertisement serving market,
reaching over 150,000 websites worldwide and serving over 300 billion advertisements 
per month, and has proved to be a scalable, reliable, and efficient ad-serving platform for
many years. 
OpenX system uses a sophisticated tracking system for advertisers and publishers to get
statistics and optimize campaigns from a central interface. It gives website publishers full
control over their advertising needs.
In this book, we will have lots of real hands-on examples to help the reader understand 
the OpenX Ad Server system.

Preface
[ 2 ]
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server introduces an example of an
advertising campaign to provide you with the basic concepts of online advertising. This
information will help you understand what you will achieve using OpenX Ad Server. It then
shows us a step-by-step installation of OpenX Ad Server on a hosting by emphasizing the
important points that we need to be careful with.
Chapter 2, Start Ad Serving with OpenX aims to start our first campaign and show the first
banner as fast as we can by using the minimum settings of OpenX Ad Server. It will prepare
you for the details of the OpenX Ad Server environment, which we will discuss one by one in
further chapters. We will use a real banner example from Amazon.
Chapter 3, Advertisers and Campaigns defines an advertiser and several different campaign
types. We will learn about several advertising and campaign terms including inventory,
campaign types campaign priority values, revenue models, delivery capping and so on. 
The next steps are the applications of such terms in an OpenX Ad Server environment with
hands-on examples. The chapter ends with tips about efficient campaign management.
Throughout the chapter, we will use some fictitious Apple Inc. campaigns about Mac  
and iPhone.
Chapter 4, Filling Campaigns with Banners gives details of OpenX banner definitions, types
of banners, advantages and disadvantages of using a certain banner type, and how they
are processed. We will apply several examples about banners including serving Google
Adsense banners in OpenX. We will learn about the vital aspect of banner serving, namely
Geotargeting. We will learn how we can customize banner deliveries according to several
factors. The chapter uses many examples on banner usage including an Apple Mac banner,
Google Adsense, and Amazon Halloween banner for Geotargeting, and so on.
Chapter 5, Adding Websites and Zones explains, with the help of a diagram, a typical
website and how advertisement spaces can be allocated in predefined zones. We learn
about different OpenX zone types, adding websites and zones, getting zone invocation 
code inserting web pages, linking banners or campaigns to zones tracking zone probability
screens, advanced zone type settings, and setting up dynamic zones that are ready to handle
different sized banners. Finally, we will learn how we can serve the advertisements on
popular blogging platforms such as WordPress and Blogger.
Chapter 6, Taking Advantage of Channels is all about how we can serve the advertisements
via channels to provide more relevancy. We will learn how to set up Site Source zone
parameter to differentiate the same zones according to site content. We will use channels to
target advertisements on specific content pages by using very easy-to-understand examples.
Finally, we will learn how we can target advertisements on a single website or multiple
websites using global channels.

Preface
[ 3 ]
Chapter 7, OpenX Account Management explains how we can turn our OpenX Ad Server
system into a multiuser management platform where website owners, ad agencies, direct
advertisers can work at the same time on their own assets. We will learn how we can define
accounts and assign users to these accounts, set permissions on the accounts, and the
differences between advertiser, website, and manager accounts.
Chapter 8, User and Account Preferences explains how advanced settings on accounts will help
us to customize ad server according to our needs. We will learn where we can change basic
account information such as name, e-mail and password and how we can set default banner
preferences, and time zone settings. We will end the chapter by learning how to audit the
OpenX system. We will learn how to track the changes on the system made by users.
Chapter 9, Upgrading OpenX will help protect the security. We will learn where we can
check the new versions of OpenX and how to upgrade to the latest version step-by-step. 
We will learn how we can export the currently used advertising data carefully into the
upgraded version.
Chapter 10, Using Reports and Statistics provides every tool to efficiently analyze the
performance of websites, website zones, advertisers, campaigns, and banners. We will learn
how we can get such statistics online. Then, we will investigate how we can export the data
into a spreadsheet such as in Excel and analyze it with a real example.
Appendix , Pop Quiz Answers contains the answers for the pop quiz questions.

Introduction and Installation of
OpenX Ad Server
Learning the essentials of online advertising with a sample will give you a very 
useful projection about what you can benefit using the OpenX Ad Server. It 
will provide you a strong foundation to get the most out of OpenX Ad Server
main features.
As the majority of web hosting service providers do not have one-click installation
for OpenX, we have to install OpenX on our own in most cases. Installing OpenX
Ad Server is not a difficult task and follows a standard procedure just like other
PHP and MySQL-based open source software. On the other hand, there are some
important key points that we should be careful about:
In this chapter, we shall learn about:

A brief introduction to OpenX Ad Server

The system requirements needed to install OpenX Ad Server

How to download and upload OpenX files to a web server

How to set file and folder permissions

How to create a MySQL database and user

How to complete installation with the wizard
This chapter is suggested for reading even if you are a tech-savvy computer user, as you 
can eliminate the possible problems while installing OpenX Ad Server.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 8 ]
Basics of OpenX Ad Serving
OpenX Ad Server system was designed to manage all aspects of an online advertising
business efficiently. Here, we will briefly look at the main OpenX terms and their interaction
with each other.
An advertiser is the person (people) or organization who owns the banners that you will
display in your advertisement serving environment (blogs, websites, e-mail newsletters, and
so on).
A campaign is a set of banners that is targeted to promote a service or product(s) typically.
A banner is a creative content that will be displayed as an advertisement. The most common
banner formats are images png, jpg, gif, animated gifs, text links, JavaScripts, Texts, HTML,
and Flash (SWF) files.
An advertiser can have multiple campaigns and each campaign can have any number of
banners inside. The following sample diagram shows the relationship among the terms—
advertiser, campaign, and banner:

A website is the representation of publisher side on OpenX system where advertisements
will be shown.
A zone is a predefined placeholder in a website to show banners. A website can have
multiple zones.
Zone 1
Website 1

An ideal advertisement statement is the complete presentation of a banner using all the
terms and target parameters.
For example, an iPhone case manufacturer (Fictitious Cases) wants to start a campaign 
for their latest leather case Model X on several blogs.
Now, let's define a sample ideal advertisement statement using several parameters.
The advertiser, Fictitious Cases wants to start iPhone Leather Case Model X campaign. The
campaign will be activated next week on Monday at 10:00 automatically. The campaign will
end in 120 days and banners will automatically expire from the system after 120 days. If the
campaign reaches 10,000 clicks or 4,000,000 impressions before 120 days, the campaign will
end up automatically as well as will not wait until the end date. 
The banners will be shown on the top 728x90 pixel zone of gadget blog A, on the right
125x125 zone of the mobile phone review site B, and as a text link on the zone defined at 
the end of each blog post of site A.
They have added three 728x90 banners namely A1, A2, and A3; two 125x125 banners
namely B1 and B2; and one text link as «Buy Super Model X here» namely C1.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 10 ]
As the company is selling its cases to only US customers, the website visitors coming from
other countries will not be able to see these ads, thus advertiser's inventory of clicks or
impressions will not be spent. The banners in the campaign will be shown to website visitors
only in US working hours.
The advertiser thinks that each visitor should only see a banner maximum of three times. 
So, if a banner reaches this impression count for a visitor, another banner will be shown
instead. So, if the banner A1 is shown three times for a unique visitor, A2 or A3 will be 
shown on next impression.
The advertiser thinks that A1 banner is much appealing than A2 and A3, and sets a higher
banner impression weight, 3 for A1, 1 for A2 and A3. So, A1 as three times more chances of
being shown than the others.
The following diagram shows this Sample campaign:

OpenX Ad Server allows defining a detailed campaign like in this example. We will learn how
to implement an example similar to this and more in OpenX system in further chapters and
see how OpenX is the vital solution to manage an advertisement network.

System requirements
While the book is being written, the latest OpenX release is 2.8.3, and the system requirements
are valid for this version. Previous versions may have the same or fewer requirements.
We must download and install OpenX Ad Server on our own or on a shared web hosting
solution. OpenX system runs on an Apache web server running with Linux. We will also 
need PHP and one of the supported database servers: MySQL or PostgreSQL. MySQL is the
preferred database server as it is easier to manage and work more efficiently with OpenX.
Some users suggested running OpenX on a Windows server with a PHP-enabled mode, but
as it is not officially supported by OpenX and open to errors, we suggest following an ideal
LAMP solution (Linux, Apache, MySql, and PHP). The following table shows the requirements
list for installing OpenX:
Linux 
Linux is essential and standard to work with
OpenX Ad Server. Some other Unix-based systems
can also run OpenX Ad Server but are not
supported officially.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 12 ]
Apache server 
An Apache server is required. The majority of
modern web hosting solutions have the latest
versions of Apache server, so it is not an issue.
PHP 
As OpenX Ad Server is written in PHP language, it
needs PHP installation.
Although PHP version 5.2 or newer is
recommended, 5.1.4 version or any greater
version is also supported.
PHP settings and
parameters
OpenX uses default PHP server settings, but 
as some server administrators change these
settings, it is wise to check whether the following
parameters are set before the installation
process:

memory_limit
Minimum 128 MB at the root settings is
required for 2.8.3 version. This is a must
for OpenX installation and operation.
Write to your web server technical
support to be sure, as not many web
hosts can provide this requirement as a
default.

magic_quotes_runtime
Off.

safe_mode
Off.

register_argc_argv
Must be on if you want to run
maintenance via command line.

file_uploads
Needs to be turned on to allow HTTP file
uploads.

mysql, ZLib, FTP, GD, openSSL
extensions
These extensions are needed for several
functions to operate correctly.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
MySQL 
It is the default OpenX Ad Server database.
Although MySQL 5.0 is recommended,. MySQL 
4.1 and greater versions are also supported
SMTP Server 
Required for sending reports by e-mail.
Installing OpenX
Make sure that your web hosting solution meets all the listed requirements before starting
the installation steps. The easiest way of determining this is by sending the requirements list
to web server technical support. We will complete installing OpenX using the following steps:

Downloading OpenX from http://openx.org

Uploading OpenX files to web host

Creating MySQL database and a user for OpenX

Using OpenX installation wizard

Making first login to OpenX management interface
Now, let's start exploring each section in detail.
Downloading OpenX
Downloading the latest version of OpenX Ad Server is an easy and straightforward task.
Let's see how we can achieve that.
Time for action – downloading OpenX
In this section, we are going to download OpenX files. 
1.
Browse to the http://www.openx.org/ad-server/download link. 
This link will open a web page where we can choose one from three types of
compressed files–zip, .tgz, and .bz2. The download page will look like this:
www.allitebooks.com

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 14 ]
2.
We have chosen default .zip file download option. On the next Thank you 
for downloading OpenX page, we save the file in the hard drive instead of
opening with the built-in ZIP file support of Windows Vista or WinRAR.
What just happened?
We have downloaded the OpenX files in the form of a compressed file on our computer.
Now, we are ready to upload the files to the web host.
Pop quiz – understanding system requirements

After you have asked your web hosting technical support to increase  
PHP memory_limit value in root settings to 128 MB, they replied that they have
temporarily increased this value from 32 MB to 128 MB. You have installed OpenX 
2.8.3 successfully and they have decreased memory_limit value to 32 MB again.
Will newly installed OpenX 2.8.3 system continue to work?
a. Yes
b. No

Uploading OpenX files
There are two common methods for uploading files to a web host:
• 
Using cPanel file manager utility 
Apply this method if you want to install OpenX on a subdirectory on your 
domain— for example, http://yourwebsite.com/openx  
• 
Using FTP client 
Apply this method if you want to install OpenX system on your root 
domain—for example, http://yourwebsite.com  
We will explain both methods with examples. 
Installing OpenX on a subdirectory is a better option, as we can hide 
the installation from search engines and from people who browse to 
our site directly.
Decide which method to choose and apply one of the actions accordingly.
Let's start with the suggested method.
Time for action – uploading OpenX using cPanel file manager
This is the first method of uploading OpenX files to web host. Many modern web hosting
solutions include a control panel called as cPanel and we can use cPanel file manager utility
to directly upload a ZIP file to web host and decompress the files there easily. 
1. 
Open File Manager utility at cPanel.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 16 ]
2. 
Web Root (public_html/www) is the default selection. Click on the Go button.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
3. 
Click on the Upload link and choose OpenX zip file using the Browse button
on the next screen.
4. 
After the upload completes, return to the main cPanel File Manager screen.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 18 ]
5. 
Right-click on the file and select Extract.
6. 
It will open a pop-up window. Just click Extract File(s) button to decompress ZIP file
into the root web folder.
All files are extracted to a folder named openx-2.8.3. As a result, OpenX Ad Server
will be reachable at http://yourwebsite.com/openx-2.8.3.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
As it is not a good path name, it is better to rename the folder with something easier
such as openx to reach at http://yourwebsite.com/openx once all installation
steps are complete.
7. 
Right-click on folder name and choose Rename option.
8. 
Rename the file as openx as shown in the following screenshot:

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 20 ]
What just happened?
OpenX files are now on the web host in a subdirectory. OpenX Ad Server will be reachable at
http://yourwebsite.com/openx after completion of all the remaining installation steps.
If you have already completed uploading OpenX files to a subdirectory using
cPanel file manager tool already, skip the following action and continue reading
setting file permissions.
Time for action – uploading OpenX using an FTP client
This is the second method of uploading files to a web server. In this section, we will learn
how to decompress the OpenX files in a local folder and upload to the root of web server
using an FTP Client. 
1. 
Right-click on the previously downloaded OpenX file and click on
Extract Here option.
As a result, we will have a folder named openx-2.8.3 with the structured folders
and files inside. Please note that the folder name will be different depending on the
OpenX version we downloaded.
2.
Upload the all files and subfolders in openx-2.8.3 folder to the web host. We
use a free FTP client software called as CoreFTP, which can be downloaded from
http://www.coreftp.com/.
Choose the all files and folders on the left pane and drag-and-drop into  
the right pane where the web root folder exists. In most cases, it is  
/www folder. The following screenshots show the process before dragging 
and dropping the files and after uploading the files to the website root:

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 22 ]
4. 
Note that it is a time consuming process as there are many files in the
OpenX system. Wait until all the files are uploaded to the web server.
What just happened?
We have uploaded all OpenX files and subfolders to web root. So, our OpenX system will 
be reachable at http://yourwebsite.com after completion of all installation steps.
Pop quiz – uploading OpenX files
Suppose that we have a very slow internet connection and want to install OpenX Ad Server
on a web host without any possible interruptions on file transfer. Which upload method is
more effective in terms of speed and reliability?
a. Using an FTP client program
b. Using cPanel file transfer utility
Setting file permissions
OpenX Ad Server system uses its several directories dynamically to create, change, and
delete files when needed. Because of this, we have to be sure that correct file permissions
applied on these folders.
Time for action – setting file permissions
Now, let's see how we will set the permissions using cPanel file manager.
1. 
Open CPanel and browse to /openx/var folder where we have uploaded
OpenX files. Right-click on the folder name and select Change Permissions.

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
2. 
Set permission level to 777 or select read, write, execute for all members
(User, Group, World). Click on Change Permissions button.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 24 ]
3. 
We must repeat this process for all the folders listed next including subfolders:

/openx/var

/openx/var/cache

/openx/var/plugins

/openx/var/templates_compiled

/openx/plugins

/openx/www/admin/plugins

/openx/www/images
What just happened?
We have set the necessary file and folder permissions to 777. It was needed for OpenX to
install and operate correctly.
Creating a MySQL database and user
This step is needed for OpenX to connect and store all the data in a MySQL database. We
will learn how to create a new database and user for this database. We will later use this
information in OpenX installation wizard.
Time for action – creating a MySQL database and user
We will use MySQL Databases link on cPanel. Even though there can be slight differences on
different versions, the main idea and flow is the same.
1. 
Click on MySQL Databases link on cPanel.
2. 
Enter a name for the database. Here, we named the database as openxdb.
Then click on Create Database button.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
3.
If we are on a shared hosting, a prefix will be added automatically to the name 
we provided. This is generally the username that we used to log in to the cPanel.
So, your database name will be of the username_databasename format.
4. 
Take a note of the database name including the prefix. 

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 26 ]
5.
Now, let's create a user and assign this user to our newly created database. 
We go back from the database creation result page and jump to MySQL Users
section. Choose a Username and Password. Repeat the password in the last
textbox and be sure that the password is not very easy to guess for security
(preferably a mixture of letters and numbers). We have chosen openx as
username. Click on Create User button after filling in all necessary textboxes.
Please note that a prefix will be added to user as well. Take a note of the username.
6. 
We need to add a user to database as the last step. Choose the newly created user
and database for OpenX, then click on Add button.
7.
In this step, we are going to assign privileges to the user in the database. Check
All PRIVILEGES option, then click on Make Changes button to give all privileges
to the user.

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
8. 
The following screenshot shows the results page after clicking on
Make Changes button:
What just happened?
We have seen how to prepare a database for OpenX Ad Server. The steps included:

Choosing a name for the database

Choosing a username and providing a secure password

Adding user to the database

Adding privileges to user for the database
Now, we are ready to continue our installation by using OpenX installation wizard.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 28 ]
OpenX installation wizard
OpenX installation wizard is the last step before we complete the installation. It is very
straightforward and OpenX installation wizard screens guide us very well.
Time for action – using OpenX installation wizard
Now, it is time to complete installation using OpenX Installation Wizard.
1.
Let's browse to domain name where we put OpenX files. In our example, it is 
http://yourwebsite.com/openx. You should use your own OpenX path. We
will be redirected to a "Welcome screen" automatically. Click on Continue to start.
2. 
Confirm the terms and privacy policy agreements. Click on I Agree button.

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
3. In this step, OpenX wizard is going to check system requirements automatically to 
ensure the integrity of the installation. The system check includes cookies, PHP
settings, and file permissions.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 30 ]
For example, the following screenshot shows that memory_limit was automatically
increased to 128 MB from 32 MB (which is minimum working requirement for
OpenX to install and operate). It is very important that our web hosting service
provider must have minimum 128 MB PHP memory_limit on the root or must
allow user installed program (OpenX, in this case) to increase this value.
4. As file permissions have no errors, we can go to the next screen by clicking
Continue button.

Chapter 1
[ 31 ]
If the system check finds any serious error, it will stop the installation temporarily
and will not let us go further until we solve the problem. If this is the case, please
check the requirements list section and file permission settings again carefully.
5. In this step, we will supply the database connection information to OpenX system. 
Choose Database Type as MySQL. As our MySQL database and PHP files operate on
the same server, we do not need to fill in Database Socket, Database Hostname,
and Database Port Number fields. Check Use local socket connection option.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 32 ]
Then, fill in Database Username, Database Password, and Database Name fields
according to information we collected in database creation step. Leave default
Advanced Settings unchanged. Then click on Continue to move to the next step.
6. If the database information is correct, an OpenX database will be created
and we will see message as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 33 ]
7.
Click on Continue button to define administration parameters.
9.
Just leave the default settings untouched in configuration checklist step and click on 
Continue button. These fields are automatically detected and filled in by the system.
10. Now, it is time to define main administrator account that we will use to manage
OpenX Ad Server.
Fill in the Administrator Username and Administrator Password fields. Enter 
a correct e-mail address in the Administrator email Address field. We have the
option to use OpenX in another language. The default is English. And finally, 
choose Timezone. 
www.allitebooks.com

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 34 ]
It is important to choose the correct time zone as the delivery of the date-and time-
dependent advertisements and delivery of reports will be made using this setting 
by OpenX Ad Server. Continue to move on to the next step.
11. In this step, several OpenX plugins will be installed one by one automatically. These
plugins are the core elements of OpenX system. The following screenshot shows
that all plugins are installed correctly. Click on Continue to move to the next step.

Chapter 1
[ 35 ]
12. Congratulations! OpenX installation is now complete. Optionally, we can join
the OpenX newsletter list to get updates and security alerts. Just click on
Continue to automatically log in and see the OpenX administration interface.

Introduction and Installation of OpenX Ad Server
[ 36 ]
13. If we see a screen like the following screenshot, it means that our OpenX installation
is correct and we are ready to add an advertiser and a campaign to start working.
What just happened?
We have completed the installation using OpenX wizard. The steps included the approval
of policy and terms agreement, system check (PHP settings, file permissions), providing
database connection information, configuration settings, opening administrator account,
selecting time zone, and installing core plugins.
We have now a working, but empty OpenX Ad Server. We will begin adding advertiser and
campaigns in the next chapter.
Have a go hero – adding another OpenX Ad server instance
Now, it is time to test your skills in installing another instance of OpenX Ad Server at your
local site http://yourwebsite.com/openxtest. Later, you can use this instance for
testing purposes as well as for applying some new things on the original installation that we
have completed together. Try to do the steps on your own without looking at the chapter
sections at first. If difficulties occur, read again the required chapter sections.

Chapter 1
[ 37 ]
Summary
It can be difficult to find a web hosting solution that suits the requirements for the latest
OpenX version (2.8.3) as there is a high PHP memory_limit parameter (128 MB). Do a
thorough search on Google with the phrases like OpenX hosting and so on, and e-mail host
supports to ensure that they provide it. Using OpenX.org user forums can also help us to
find the best OpenX web hosts.
In this chapter, we learned how to install OpenX on a web server. 
Specifically, we covered:

Requirements

Downloading and uploading files

Summary
In this chapter, we have gained a fundamental knowledge about how OpenX Ad Server works
basically. We followed the fastest possible way to start serving an advertisement without
entering the details of advertiser, campaign, and website settings.
Now, let's begin learning the details of OpenX Ad Server in the next chapter.

Advertisers and Campaigns
Understanding how advertisers need different campaign models is the key for
learning OpenX Ad Server system. The OpenX system is designed to manage
even the very detailed and sophisticated needs of a campaign to ensure
success. This chapter is essential for the correct organization of advertisers and
campaigns in an OpenX system.
In this chapter, we shall learn:

 How to add an advertiser and set report delivery options for each advertiser

 What the term Inventory means

 Differences between different campaign types (Contract, Contract-Exclusive 
and Remnant)

 How to set priorities for different campaigns and how they affect a 
campaign delivery

 The details of CPC, CPM, CPA, and Tenancy revenue models

 How to add a campaign using different campaign types

 What delivery capping and companion positioning are

 The tips for effective advertiser and campaign management

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 60 ]
Advertisers
Advertisers are the companies or the people who are the owners of advertisements that
are set to display on websites. A Campaign is a well-defined bunch of banners, text links, or
any other advertising media to be delivered on the defined zones of websites according to
several criteria. Advertisers can own more than one campaign on the OpenX system.
Adding an advertiser
The first step when using the OpenX system is to add an advertiser. We will not be able to
create campaigns and banners unless we add an advertiser.
Time for action – adding Apple as an advertiser
Suppose, we have made a fictitious contract with Apple Inc. and will serve their ads about
several devices such as iMac, iPhone, and many more on our website.
In this section, we are going to add Apple Inc. as a sample advertiser to OpenX Ad Server and
set the basic parameters.
1. 
Let's log in to the OpenX administration panel. Use the username and password that
we created in Chapter 1.
The login page looks like this:
2. 
Click on Inventory tab at the top menu, choose Advertisers submenu and then
click on Add new advertiser link. 

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
3.
We are now in the Add new Advertiser page. Fill in the Name, Contact, and Email
fields accordingly. Since this information will be used when the OpenX system
sends reporting e-mails to the advertiser, it is important to correctly define 
these fields. We have filled details in the fields fictitiously for our example.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 62 ]
4.
In the Advertiser report section, check Email when a campaign is automatically
activated/deactivated option. Check Email campaign delivery reports option 
as well. Put 15 as a value for the Number of days between campaign delivery
reports option.
5.
Check Display only one banner from this advertiser on a web page option.
Let's write some additional comments in the Comments textbox about the
advertiser. Click the Save Changes button to complete adding a new advertiser.
6. 
We can change the information about an advertiser at any time just by clicking
on its name on the advertiser list.

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
What just happened?
We have completed adding Apple Inc. as an advertiser to OpenX system. We have 
specifically covered:

Logging in to OpenX system with the username administrator

Opening Add new advertiser page

We have filled in basic information about the advertiser. It is wise to give a
fully descriptive advertiser name if we will work with many advertisers for ease 
of management

We have taken advantage of the OpenX built-in advertiser report delivery system

Since we checked Email when a campaign is automatically
activated/deactivated option, the advertiser will be reminded
about the end of a campaign. This is especially useful for big
advertisers who are dealing with tens or hundreds of campaigns 
at the same time and don't have enough time to track activation
and deactivation of campaigns manually. We have checked Email
campaign delivery reports option as well. It enables an advertiser
to get e-mail reports about their campaigns at defined intervals. In
our case, it was 15 days. It is useful, if we don't plan to give online
access to an advertiser on our OpenX system but still send regular
automatically generated reports to an advertiser about their
campaigns.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 64 ]

If we want to limit the impression of a banner on a page to only one banner for a
specific advertiser at a time, we check Display only one banner from this advertiser
on a web page option.
The following diagram shows a sample web page when this option was enabled.
Notice that as the banner on the right side is shown (served), the top and the
bottom banners will not be running at the same time from the same advertiser.
In another example, if we had shown a banner on the top, then the remaining zones
would not show a banner from the same advertiser if this option was checked.
Surely, these zones can be filled by the banners of other advertisers.
Finally, we have written some notes about the advertiser into Comments box
and completed adding a new advertiser.

Campaigns
The first thing we should be clear about is the term "inventory of a website" before
explaining the details of campaigns.

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
Inventory of a website
Inventory of a website is the total page views (impressions), that the website is getting
over a certain time, usually calculated monthly. Thus, it shows the approximate ad serving
capacity of a website for advertisers. For example, think of the potential of a website with 
an inventory of 10,000,000 monthly impressions for advertisers.
Impressions show how many times an advertisement (usually a banner) is shown
on a web page/website.
Typically if an ad is only once used on a web page, it will be counted as 1.
If you put same ad twice on a page with different places, then impression will be
2 for each page impression.
Clicks show how many times visitors click on this ad.
Let's say a banner got 100 clicks for 1000 impressions for a week. Then, CTR
(Click-through rate) would be 100/1000 = 10%
Surely, all these numbers are generally calculated in time frames such as daily,
weekly, monthly and so on.
In-house versus paid campaigns
There are basically two types of campaigns for websites which are being used in
online advertising. 
In-house campaigns refer to the campaigns in which a website doesn't sell its inventory to
advertisers directly. These campaigns cover usage of several affiliate marketing and online
advertising programs to earn money. For example, using Commission Junction (CJ.com)
advertisers and Google AdSense are two examples of popular in-house campaigns. 
Paid campaigns are the campaigns that are sold to advertisers directly. For example, a mobile
phone review site can sell its 20,000 monthly impressions (inventory) on the iPhone 3G
section of the website to an online iPhone accessories shop for an advertising campaign. 
Campaign types in OpenX
Before discussing campaign types, we should clearly understand what target types mean
for the campaigns.
Target types are the conditions and limitations that will cause a campaign to
automatically deactivate.
Let's look at the following examples:

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 66 ]

A campaign on a website with a target of 500 clicks and without an End Date. As a
result, this campaign will run until all 500 clicks will be delivered.

A campaign with a target of either 400 clicks or 100,000 impressions without an end
date. The campaign will stop running when 400 clicks or 100,000 impressions  have
been reached.

A campaign without any targets on clicks or impressions but with an End Date. This
campaign will end automatically after End Date is reached.
OpenX supports both In-house and Paid campaigns but names them differently on 
its system.
There are 3 types of campaigns that we can define on the OpenX system. 

Contract: 
This campaign type is suitable for Paid campaigns which we sell to advertisers
directly with target types such as limits on time, impressions and so on.

Contract (Exclusive): 
This campaign is essentially similar to Contract type. The difference is that the
Exclusive Contract will take all the impressions before all other campaign types. In
other words, it is the most prioritized campaign type in OpenX.

Remnant: 
This campaign type is suitable for in-house ads that we run. A remnant campaign
will be available only if there are no Contract and Contract (Exclusive) campaigns
running for the same zones. 
Understanding campaign priorities
Since multiple campaigns run at the same time on a typical OpenX Ad Server
implementation, it is essential to understand how often they will be delivered. The OpenX
system uses Campaign Weight and Priority Level naming to evaluate the banner impressions
percentage of a campaign. 
If there are Contract (Exclusive) campaigns for certain website zones, the others are
neglected. If there are Contract campaigns, Remnant campaigns will not be delivered.
Each campaign type is prioritized only in its group. While Contract type gets Priority Level
naming, Contract (Exclusive) and Remnant campaigns get Campaign Weight naming as a
term for prioritization in its own group.

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
The following sample chart shows how OpenX basically decides which campaign to give
priority, thus a percentage of total inventory impressions. Please, note that we assume all
campaigns target the same zone.
The last three campaigns will not be served because of the running Contract (Exlusive)
campaigns for this certain zone. So, a Remnant Campaign with Weight 7 cannot start if there
is still an inventory for the other Contract (Exclusive) or Contract campaigns. In this specific
example, only the first two Contract (Exclusive) campaigns will be delivered.If Contract
(Exclusive) campaigns stop running, the other Contract type campaigns can start. 
Campaign revenue information
Revenue types determine how the publisher will be paid by the advertiser as a result of
serving advertisement s.
Each campaign has to choose one of the four different revenue types in the OpenX system.
Let's learn each revenue type with an example. 
Note that campaign revenue information is called Pricing Model in
the OpenX environment.

CPC (Cost Per Click): The most common online advertising revenue model is CPC.
It shows how much an advertiser is willing to pay for a click on a banner in a 
certain campaign. Google AdSense is the most famous CPC advertising network. 
For example, an advertiser who will pay $0.20 for a single banner click on a
publisher website.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 68 ]

CPM (Cost Per Mille): CPM defines how much an advertiser pays for 1000 ad
impressions (not clicks). It is also widely used. If a publisher sells her/his 200,000
impressions inventory for $5 CPM, she/he has the potential to earn 200,000 / 1,000 
* 5 = $1000, if the website(s) can serve all the impressions for the campaign.

CPA (Cost Per Action): An action is a result of visitor activity. For example, they can
buy a book on advertiser's site after clicking a banner, sign up for a free newsletter
or become member for an online paid service. CPA shows how much an advertiser
will pay for the result of such actions. Let's give a concrete example. Think of an
online dating website which pays $10 to that the publisher for each new member
the publisher sends them using a website.

Tenancy: Some advertisers prefer to buy advertisement spots for their campaigns
on a certain monthly fee without paying for CPC, CPA or CPM. Think of a marketing
blogger who sells a space for the advertising of an e-book product for a monthly fee
of $100, no matter how many times the banner will be shown or how many times it
will be clicked.
Because we have learned the basic terminology and uses, we can start adding a campaign to 
an advertiser.
Adding campaigns to an advertiser
We will now learn how to add each campaign type in detail with examples.
Time for action – adding a contract type campaign for Apple
In this section, we will learn the most commonly used campaign type; Contract, which
enables publishers to sell their inventory to advertisers with limitations on delivery.
Please, read the What Just Happened section which immediately follows
this section very carefully after you complete the following actions to
understand all the details and tricks of Contract Type campaigns.
We will define a campaign for Apple Inc. which will be about different Mac devices.
1. 
Click on Advertisers on the left menu and then click Add new campaign
near the Advertiser's Name. 

Chapter 3
[ 69 ]
2. 
A default campaign name will be created by adding the text Default Campaign to
the end of the advertiser's name. 
3. 
Change the Name field to Apple Inc. – Mac Devices and then click the
Contract option.

4. 
Do not touch Start date and End date options in Date section. 
5. 
Let's continue with the Pricing section. The CPM option is selected by default.
Let’s change it into the CPC Pricing model option. 
6. 
Fill in the other fields according to the following screenshot:
7. 
We will now define Priority in relation to other campaigns. Fill the shown fields
according to the following screenshot:

8. 
Let's continue with Delivery Capping per Visitor section. Arrange the fields
according to the following screenshot.
9.
Let's finish adding a Contract campaign by filling in Miscellaneous options.
Select both Hide the advertiser and websites of this campaign and
Companion positioning options. Write some comments about the campaign
in the Comments textbox and finally click on the Save Changes button:
What just happened?
We have completed the addition of a contract type campaign. Now, let's learn why we have
chosen several options and investigate alternative Contract type definition possibilities. We
will now review each action item.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 72 ]
In this campaign, you can see that we have chosen the CPC pricing model. However, there
are other pricing models too. Let's now review each one of them.

CPC Pricing model: According to this setting, the publisher will earn $0.40 for each
click. As there is a maximum of 500 clicks; the advertiser can earn a maximum of
$0.40x500 = $200 for the campaign. If 500 clicks are reached, the campaign will be
deactivated automatically as well without looking at the End date.
Notice that we assume that we use USD currency for our system even though we only
provided the price without the $ sign.
We could leave Clicks number as Unlimited. In that case, the campaign serving
duration would depend on only the End Date parameter.
Let's also explain the alternative Pricing model definitions that we could choose.

CPM Pricing model: According to the following CPM settings, the publisher can
earn a maximum of 30,000 / 1,000 * 10 = $300 for this campaign. The campaign 
will be stopped if the campaign reaches its maximum impressions (in this case, it 
is 30,000 impressions) even though we set End Date as Don't expire in Date
section previously.

CPA model: Cost per Action(CPA) model is useful when an advertiser wants to
pay only for some action of the banner visitor. It can be a sale or a sign up to a
newsletter or trial offer, thus a conversion is needed for the advertiser. 
According to the following example, the advertiser will pay $3 for the each
occurrence of the action. The maximum number of Conversions is 1,000. So, the
publisher can earn up to $3,000. Notice that we have defined a maximum value for
the Clicks option. It means that the campaign will end regardless of the remaining
conversions in the inventory if the Clicks number reaches 50,000. The other case 
is also valid. If the campaign gets 1,000 conversions, the campaign will deactivate
automatically regardless of how many clicks are left.

Chapter 3
[ 73 ]
Some advertisers can set such multiple limits to control campaigns that get a lot
of clicks but have a small number of conversions.

Tenancy Model: This model is commonly used by bloggers and website owners
who sell their inventory for a monthly fee regardless of how many impressions,
clicks or conversions the campaign gets. In the following example, the campaign
pays $100 monthly:
While changing the campaign types, we need to change the different settings that suit a
particular campaign type. Let's now review each setting: 

Priority level: It defines how often the advertisements in a campaign will be
delivered (impressions) in comparison to the other campaigns in the same Contract
type campaign group. The Priority level can get a setting of 1 to 10; 1 being the
lowest and 10 being the highest priority. The default is 5.
www.allitebooks.com

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 74 ]
A campaign with a priority of 4 will have its banners shown two times more with
a same type campaign priority of 2. The OpenX Ad Server system automatically
optimizes priority-based deliveries with real-time calculations.
Look at the difference between the following sample screenshots, we have set
Priority Level to 7 and limited daily clicks to 50. The campaign stops delivery
temporarily if 50 clicks are reached per day and it continues the next day by trying
to reach 50 clicks again. If we had defined a CPC campaign with a maximum of 
500 clicks, it would take a minimum of 500 / 50 = 10 days to end this campaign
automatically as a best case scenario. (If the campaign banners can achieve reaching
the 50 clicks limit per day).
Let's look at the same example if we had set a specific date for the End Date field.
Notice that the limit options disappeared below. 
The reason behind this behavior is logical. As we set an end date and maximum
clicks options, the OpenX system will use its built-in automatic distribution system
to deliver clicks evenly for the remaining days in the campaign according to the 
End date.

Chapter 3
[ 75 ]
So, it needs careful planning when we play with the End Date and Limit options for
campaigns. The OpenX Ad Server campaign screens dynamically change according to
options that we choose. It helps us choose the correct campaign settings according
to our needs.

Delivery capping per visitor: This section can be an important setting for many
advertisers. It is proven that website visitors are used to seeing the same banners
multiple times over much time and even learn them visually and do not respond
them. If a visitor didn't click on a banner even after it was shown many times, it is
likely that they will never click on them because they are simply not interested in
that campaign. To remedy this situation, OpenX introduces us a useful setting, called
Delivery capping per visitor. Using this setting, we can control how many times a
certain campaign ad will be shown to a visitor.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 76 ]
Let's look at the following specific situation again, which we have set previously:
We have set Limit campaign views to: 9 in total and Limit campaign views to 3 per
session. We didn't touch the Reset view counters after option.
OpenX Ad Server has the ability to track individual website visitors by using cookies
(small text files which are saved on the user's temporary internet files). When a
user opens a website, a session starts. When the user closes the website and the
browser, the session ends.
Suppose that a visitor came to the website where our campaign banners were
shown using a web browser and he/she browsed five pages there and has already
seen three of the same or different banners from the same campaign. The fourth
banner will not be shown from this campaign for the user session. It is possible
that on the next day, a maximum of three banners will be shown to the visitor for
another session (starting a web browser again). At the end, this visitor will not
see any banners from this campaign after nine views as it is the total limit in our
example. 
If the user browser doesn't save the cookies information (cookies are disabled),
OpenX neglects Delivery capping per visitor settings. If the visitor deletes the
cookies after some time (it is generally done by clearing temporary files in browsers
such as Firefox, Internet Explorer etc.) the Delivery cappings are reset to zero.
It is wise to use the Reset view counters after option if there are major changes in
campaigns and visitors are expected to click on a new set of banners. For example,
if we set 240 hours counter, the visitor delivery capping limits will be set to zero for
every 10 days, thus increasing delivery chance for a certain visitor.

Chapter 3
[ 77 ]
Hide the advertiser and websites of this campaign. This option is useful when we
don't want certain user accounts, which were opened to get reports in the system,
to know in which websites this campaign is running. It is useful to hide full pricing
from advertiser. We will talk more about user accounts in Chapter 7.

Companion positioning: This option is an interesting feature to discover further.
This setting assures that if a banner from a campaign is shown on a page, all 
the remaining banners will be from the same campaign. This option is useful 
when an advertiser wants to run campaign banners exclusively on a page in 
all-or-nothing logic.
Let's give a concrete example. Assume that Campaign A has two banners; A1 and
A2. Another Campaign B has 3 banners; B1, B2, and B3 and their targeting zones on
a website are the following:

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 78 ]
If we apply companion positioning on campaign A, all the possible banner outcomes for 
each zone on every impression of the web page would be; 
Thus, banners from different campaigns cannot appear on the same page at the same time if
we apply companion positioning.
We will continue this example by adding a banner to Apple Inc – Mac Devices campaign
in the next chapter.  But before that, we should learn the differences between Contract
and Contract (Exclusive) campaigns clearly. So, let's go with defining a Contract
(Exclusive) Campaign.
Time for action – adding a Contract (Exclusive) type campaign
Contract (Exlusive) type gives the advertiser the most exclusive delivery of campaign as the
name implies. As soon as we start a Contract (Exclusive) campaign and target to a zone, this
campaign will have the priority to be shown on the zone, bypassing impressions of other
Contract and Remnant type campaigns.
Now, let's learn how to add a Contract (Exlusive) type campaign by action.
1. 
Click on Advertisers on the left-side menu and then click Add new campaign
near the advertiser's name. 

Chapter 3
[ 79 ]
2. 
A default campaign name will be created by adding the text Default Campaign
to the end of the advertiser's name.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 80 ]
3. 
Change the Name field according to the following screenshot and then click
the Contract (Exclusive) option:
4.
Fill the Date and Pricing sections according to the following screenshot. Choose
CPC option and give a Rate / Price value of 0.30. Notice that you cannot
further edit Clicks and Impressions fields. They were set to Unlimited.

Chapter 3
[ 81 ]
4.
When we continue scrolling down on the add a campaign page after the
Pricing section, we will see Set the campaign weight parameter. Write a
value of 3 for the sample.
5. 
Ignore Delivery capping per visitor and Miscellaneous sections. Click Save
Changes button to finish adding a Contract (Exclusive) campaign.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 82 ]
6.
After clicking Save Changes button, we will return to the campaign listings page.
Here we can see the basic details of a campaign on the right side for a 
quick review of each campaign.
What just happened?
We have learned how to start Contract (Exclusive) campaigns to deliver all target types
(impressions, clicks, conversions) as soon as possible by ignoring other campaign types such
as Contract and Remnant.
We can start a campaign as soon as we add it or on a future date automatically. When we
assign an End Date for a Contract (Exclusive) campaign, it is not allowed further defining of
a target delivery limit such as Impressions, Clicks and so on is not allowed. We cannot set
both an end date and target limits for an Exclusive campaign at the same time. It is a logical
application by OpenX as we want to give exclusive priority to the campaign by not counting
impressions using a specific end date or running the campaign until one of the assigned
delivery limits (clicks, impressions, conversions) reached without a specific end date. 

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
In the following sample screenshot for the latter case, we can see how we enabled Clicks and
Impressions fields by not setting a specific End Date. Specifically, we sell the inventory for
each click at $0.30 CPC and the campaign will run until 500,000 impressions are delivered.
Note that we didn't put a limitation on CPC as we want the campaign to get as many clicks
while it is active for 5,00,000 banner impressions.
Pop quiz – understanding different campaign types
Answer the following questions according to the following Campaign and Website Zone
Diagram. It shows currently running campaigns and their targets:

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 84 ]
1. For Zone C;as there are no campaigns targeting here, is it true that a blank space will
be shown to visitors?
a. True
b. False
2. For Zone D; which of the following statements is (are) true?
a.
All the campaign banners except the Remnant campaign will appear here
b.
Banners from only the Remnant campaign will appear here
c.
Even though Contract (Exclusive) Campaigns don't target this zone, they will
appear here
3. For Zone B; which of the following statements is (are) true?
a.
Contract (Exclusive) Campaign with Weight 2 has two times less delivery chance
than Contract Campaign with Priority 4
b.
Only Contract (Exclusive) Campaign with Weight 2 will appear here
c.
Only Contract Campaign with Priority 4 will be delivered in this zone
Have a go hero – adding a Remnant type campaign
As we have learned about Contract (Exclusive) campaign type in detail, now it is time for a
little challenge. Apply exactly the same steps of Contract (Exclusive) to create a Remnant
type and try to understand the main difference between Contract (Exclusive) and Remnant
types even though all the screen elements are the same.
Tips for efficient advertiser and campaign management
Try to apply the following tips whenever possible as a standard. They will help you manage
advertisers and campaigns more effectively. 
Tip 1: Using a consistent naming convention
Even though the OpenX system provides a great flexibility in usage and an easy management
environment, we can face difficulties if the number of managed advertisers and campaigns
increases to large numbers. So, a naming plan should be developed to apply all the elements
in OpenX system, specifically for advertisers and campaigns as it is the topic of this chapter.
Avoid using shortcuts for advertisers, names. Suppose we have named Fictitious iPhone
Case's advertiser as FIC. It would be difficult later to remember these shortcuts especially in
the reports section, if there are similar advertiser shortcut names such as FIG, FHC, and so
on. Then give full names instead.

Chapter 3
[ 85 ]
We can put a shortcut before or after the advertiser name and campaign name convention
to remind us which type of campaign it is, just by looking at its name.
To be specific, we could use CE for Contract (Exclusive), C for Contract and R for 
Remnant types.
For Example, Campaign Names:

Apple Inc. - iPhone Accessories – CE

Apple Inc - iMacs with Savings – C

Amazon.com - DVD – Adventure Blu-Ray - R
Tip 2: Using duplicate campaign function 
This is quite a handy shortcut, if we want to start new campaigns for an advertiser with the
same or similar settings.
Look at the Actions menu on the campaign listings page. There is a Duplicate link to create
a new campaign with the same settings. Then we should make the required changes on the
newly-created campaign including changing the campaign name.

Advertisers and Campaigns
[ 86 ]
Note the text Copy of added before the newly-created campaign.
Tip 3: Filtering active campaigns 
Suppose that we have 130 inactive and only 5 active campaigns in OpenX system. We don't
want to delete inactive campaigns as it is possible that they will be restarted at a future date.
To work easily with only 5 active campaigns, we can filter the listing by choosing the Show
Active campaigns link on the top right side of campaign listings.
Tip 4: Guaranteeing campaign impressions on a zone
It is quite possible that a website zone will not display any banners at all in OpenX system
and instead a blank space will be shown to the visitor, thus losing a valuable ad spot.
There are two reasons for this unfavorable situation:

There are no campaigns which target this zone

All campaigns which target this zone have expired or deactivated
To prevent this, we can use a Remnant campaign, which targets this zone with an End 
Date that is very far on such as a date on 2020. If there are Contract or Contract (Exclusive)
campaigns for the zone, the Remnant campaign will not be shown. In the case of where
there are no Contract or Contract Exclusive campaigns, this Remnant campaign will be shown
until 2020 by guaranteeing impressions on the valuable advertisement space.

Chapter 3
[ 87 ]
Summary
Managing campaigns effectively is a core part of OpenX Ad Server. 
In this chapter, at first, we have learnt the essentials of online advertising: inventory and
campaign types. Then, we have seen how to apply pricing models in these campaigns by
emphasizing on the differences among them. We have then examined important subjects
such as delivery capping per visitor and companion positioning. 
In the next chapter, we will learn adding banners to campaigns and managing them in detail.

Filling Campaigns with Banners
Choosing the correct banner types and applying them in a standardized
organization is essential in order to get high performance from OpenX Ad
Server. This chapter teaches you all of the vital aspects of banner management
in OpenX.
In this chapter, we shall learn about:

Different types of banners in OpenX system

How each banner type is processed differently

The advantages and disadvantages of each banner type

How to add a Google AdSense banner in OpenX

The importance of geotargeting and how to apply it

Defining different types of delivery limitations for banners
Banners
Banners are 'creative' for advertisements. They have many different formats including
images (jpg,.png), animated image files (.gif), Flash files(.swf), Textlinks, texts, HTML,
and JavaScript, that help in displaying advertisement s. Banners are added to campaigns 
and shown in the zones of websites.

[ 90 ]
Understanding banner types
There are five different ways to add a banner to OpenX Ad Server 2.8.3 system. Let's review
each of them and understand the differences.
Local banners using webserver
This is the most widely used banner type. It is used for image banner advertisements
including .jpg, .gif, and .png files. Banners are individually uploaded to OpenX Ad Server
and stored in a folder in the file system. The default storage folder is /www/images/ where
OpenX system is installed. When a banner is uploaded to OpenX system, it is automatically
renamed to a random unique string to keep the banner names unique in OpenX Ad Server.

Time for action – adding a local webserver banner
to Apple Inc - Mac Devices campaign
In this section, we will learn how to add one of the most popular banner types in OpenX Ad
Server system—a local web server banner to our Apple Mac Devices Campaign example. This
banner type is used when we want to store banner image files on our web server.
1. 
Click on the Campaigns link to see a list of all campaigns for an advertiser on
the  advertisers' listing page. In this special case, campaigns for Apple Inc.

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
2.
We will see all the campaigns for the advertiser. Click on Add New banner link for
 one of the campaigns. In this special case, we will add a new banner for
Apple Inc. – Mac Devices campaign.

3. 
By default, Upload a local banner to the webserver banner type is selected
automatically as in the following screenshot:
4. 
If it is not selected by default, select this banner type from the available
banner type options.
5. 
Now, it is time to give a name to our banner. For our example, we have chosen to
write 300x250_New_Mac. Give the same name.
6.
Let's upload the banner file to our webserver where the banner files will reside.
Click on Browse button and choose the banner image file. Choose any image file
you want with a size of 300 width and 250 height.
You can use Google (image search http://images.google.com) to find a banner
of the necessary size easily.

Chapter 4
[ 93 ]
In this example, we have used a real iMac banner that is of the size, 300x250.
7. 
Rename the image file you selected as 300x250 followed by _New_iMac.
8. 
The following screenshot shows what it will look like after we choose an image file:
9.
Enter the destination URL where the visitors will be sent when they click
on this banner. Notice the http:// protocol string at the beginning of
the string. Be careful to include this to open the correct URL on a web
browser. Write http://www.apple.com/imac for Destination URL.

[ 94 ]
10. Leave Target textbox blank.
11. In the Banner display section, we will provide extra information
about how a banner will be shown on Internet browsers.
12. Enter some text in the Alt text field.
13. Write imac.com in the Status text field.
14. Type the following text in the Text below image field.
15. Ignore the Keywords field in the Additional Data section. Give a
Weight value for the banner as in the following screenshot.
We can enter additional comments (notes) about the banner in the Comments field.
After completing all the fields, click on the Save changes button.

What just happened?
We have learned how to add a local webserver banner on the OpenX system and how it will
be saved on the OpenX Server using automatic image file renaming and size information.
We have followed a certain naming convention system for ease of management.
Concatenation of banner size and short banner description would be an effective method.
Our 300x250_New_iMac followed this rule: 
Note that we have also used a naming convention system for banner images and how we will
store them on our local folders for easy management.
Sample Template: 
c:\banners\advertiser_name\campaign_name
Banner Image: 300x250_New_iMac.jpg
Banner Folder: c:\banners\apple\mac\
Note that uploaded banners will be renamed by OpenX server to a random unique string and
they will be served from a certain directory in OpenX server. Local banner naming convention
is just for easy management.
As Target parameter was an advanced option; we did not explain the details
because this book is aimed at providing information at beginner level. For
curious readers: search the HTML Target Attribute phrase on Google to learn
the usage of Target parameter.
A small box will be opened under the cursor if text is provided. An alternate text, that is, Alt
text, is used to give a tip when a visitor moves the cursor over the banner on the web browser.
The following screenshot shows the section where the sample banner is shown on a blog
with Alt text:

Filling Campaigns with Banners
[ 98 ]
If the Alt text field is left blank, nothing will be displayed if you hover your cursor over the
banner on the web page.
Status text will be shown as target URL on the status bar of the web browser when the
cursor is on the banner. Note that it is just a text shown on the status bar and doesn't affect
the Destination URL that we have provided in one of the previous steps. Visitors will be
redirected to Destination URL anyway.
Actually, many modern web browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer don't hide the actual
URL even if we fill Status text field. 
In any case, it is wise to hide the destination from visitors for other browsers if we are using
affiliate links.
Text below image field can be used to provide a text under the banner to give extra
information when the banner is displayed on the website zone. Note that this option only
works with local image banner types. The following screenshot shows our banner with the
Text below image field as we have provided:

Weight shows the probability of a banner being displayed. For example, a banner with a
weight of four will be delivered approximately two times more than another banner in 
the same campaign with a weight of two.
Note that we didn't provide size information for the uploaded banner. The reason is that
OpenX Ad Server automatically recognizes the size information of the banners being
uploaded to webserver as in our example.
Local banners using SQL
By using a Local SQL banner option, the banners are uploaded to the OpenX system
individually as in local banners (webserver). The difference is that the banners are stored 
in the database as binary data instead of storing them in a folder.

Have a go hero – adding a local SQL type banner to OpenX
Now, add a local SQL type banner using Upload a local banner to the database option. You
should notice that there are not many differences between Local SQL and Local webserver
banner types except with regards to how the banner image is stored. Finally, read the following
local banner type advantages and disadvantages section to strengthen your knowledge about
both local banner types by knowing about their advantages and disadvantages.
Local banners using webserver—advantages and disadvantages
Let's first look at the advantages:

As the files are stored locally on a hard drive on OpenX Ad Server file system, it is
easy to reach them by direct access.

There is no database access for individual banners. It gives a better performance
result as compared to Local Banners (SQL) type banners, which are stored in 
MySQL database system.

Filling Campaigns with Banners
[ 100 ]
Let's now move on to the disadvantages:

It is necessary to back up \www\images folder regularly to protect the OpenX
system against any errors on hard drives or data loss.

As the image files are served from our server, it can bring bandwidth problems 
on large OpenX systems.
Local banners using SQL—advantages and disadvantages
Let's first look at the advantages:

Easy management and backups. We only need to take backups of OpenX system 
files and database. There are no image files to backup separately.
Let's now move on to the disadvantages:

As the image files are stored in database system, the database can grow very quickly.
It will result in performance problems in large systems, which is not recommended.

We can't access individual image files directly as there are no images in a folder.
Generic HTML banners
This banner type is suitable for anything that is intended to be shown using HTML. This
could be an HTML web form, multiple images, tables, JavaScript files, or even You Tube 
files. For example, Google AdSense code should be selected in OpenX system as a Generic
HTML banner, as it uses JavaScript to be delivered. We will give an example on how to define
Google AdSense code in OpenX Ad Server later in this chapter.
<Script type=”text/

Time for action – adding Google AdSense ads with OpenX
In this section, we will learn how to add a Google AdSense code to OpenX system. We 
will add Google as an advertiser and start a Remnant type campaign, then we will add a
sample banner using Generic HTML banner option. Note that this section assumes that you
are already working with Google AdSense platform and know how to retrieve the Google
AdSense code. 
For new Google AdSense users: please refer to  
http://www.google.com/adsense for more information about the 
Google AdSense program.
1. 
On the Advertisers page, click on Add new advertiser link.

Uncheck the options under Advertiser report section except the Number of 
Days between the campaign delivery reports field, leave this field the way it is.
Click on the Save Changes button to complete adding Google as an advertiser.
Google is listed in the advertisers section now. Click on Add new campaign link
to continue.
3. 
The next step is to start a Remnant campaign, which will not have any end
date or other limitations.

10. Give an informative name for the banner as in the following example:
11. Copy and paste Google AdSense code to the Create an HTML banner - banner code
section and choose Do not alter HTML option.
12. Leave the Banner link section to its default setting and move to Banner
display section.

Chapter 4
[ 107 ]
13. Fill the Width and Height fields for Google Adsense banner. Be careful to define
the exact size of Google Adsense code that we paste. As we have chosen to use a
300x250 Adsense banner, we have set these fields accordingly to 300 and 250.
14. Leave the Additional data section to its default setting. Click on the Save changes
button at the end.
15. Our banner is created on OpenX system now. Let's click on the banner name
to preview banner properties.

[ 108 ]
16. Note that the Google Adsense banner will be displayed at the top of the banner
properties screen for preview.
What just happened?
We have seen how to add a Google Adsense advertisement to OpenX Ad Server.
Note that we have written our e-mail address when defining Google as an advertiser, as 
we will run this advertiser's campaign in-house. Also note that we have unchecked the 
fields in the advertiser report section as it is better to keep track of reports of AdSense 
in Google's site.

Chapter 4
[ 109 ]
We have added Google – Adsense as a Remnant type campaign. Note that Remnant
campaigns run only if the Contract and Contract Exclusive campaigns, which target the same
website zone, are not present. We can also start Google-Adsense as a Contract Exclusive
campaign if it is our main income source and we don't use paid advertising for our inventory.
We have chosen especially Do not alter HTML option for Google Adsense ads. As Google is
very careful about the changes on their Adsense code, it provides us a safer way to work
with Adsense code on OpenX Ad Server.
Note that as using Google Adsense is not the topic of this book, we didn't additionally show
how to generate Adsense code. We assumed that we already have it.
You should visit Gogle AdSense website at http://www.google.com/adsense
for more information about registering with Google Adsense program and getting the
advertisemnt codes.
Generic HTML banners—advantages and disadvantages
We now move on to the advantages and disadvantages of this banner type. The only
advantage it has is that it is easy to define if the advertiser provides us with the HTML code.
All we need to do is to correctly copy and paste the code in a textbox in the OpenX banner
addition screen. The only disadvantage being the extra caution that we have to take while
writing or pasting HTML code in OpenX system. A missing character can affect the correct
delivery of banners—for example, an apostrophe or HTML tag closing bracket.
Generic Text banners
Generic Text banner type is suitable for anything that is intended to be shown as pure text.
Simple text links are popular usages. Moreover, we could also write long paragraphs of text
as advertisements.

Have a go hero – adding a generic text banner to OpenX
Now it is your turn to investigate more on Generic Text banners. Add a new Generic Text
banner and learn what it looks like by editing the banner again.
Generic text banners—advantages and disadvantages
There is only one advantage of generic text banners which is the fact that it is easy to define
them with no need for size definition or uploading/linking an image banner. All we need is to
write a text and define a link for it.
However, there are following two disadvantages:

We can't put HTML code in generic text banner. Even if we put HTML code it
will be shown as regular text on the web pages.

Generic text banners can only be linked to text ad zones. We will talk about 
zones in the next chapter in detail.
External banners 
This banner type is suitable especially for the campaigns, where we use banners of affiliate
networks. Simply, the image files are not stored in OpenX system. Instead, images are served
directly from the image provider's web server.

Time for action – adding an external banner type for Amazon
In this section, we will start a fictitious Amazon Halloween holiday campaign and add an
external type banner under it.
1.
Let's start by adding a Contract (Exclusive) Halloween campaign to Amazon
advertiser that we have already added in Chapter 2.
2.
Open the Advertisers list and click on Add new campaign link near Amazon.
3. 
Enter Amazon – Halloween as campaign name and select Campaign

8. 
Let's write Amazon – Halloween Special Promotion Banner for the Name field.
9. 
Provide an Image URL where our banner resides. Find any image that is the
size of 468x60 on the Internet and copy and paste the image location.
In the following screenshot, we have used a fictitious image URL.
We could take the real Amazon banner image from the Amazon Associates Program
website at http://affiliate-program.amazon.com.
10. Provide a Destination URL where visitors will be sent when they click on the
banner. Provide any web address of your choice. Here again, the link is fictitious.
We could provide our real Amazon affiliate banner link, which we would take from
Amazon Associates website banners section at http://affiliate-program.

11. Fill the Alt text field as in the following screenshot and fill the Size options
as 468 and 60:

Chapter 4
[ 115 ]
12. Give a value of 8 to the Weight field. And finally, let's click on the Save changes
button to create our banner.
What just happened?
We have seen how to add an external type banner.
Specifically, we have covered the following steps:

We have started a Contract (Exclusive) campaign and defined the start and end
dates. We made this especially as our Halloween campaign is seasonal, and should
have priority over other campaign types (Contract, Remnant).

We have added an external type banner.

Filling Campaigns with Banners
[ 116 ]

We provided an alt text, which will be shown in a tip box when the visitor moves
the mouse over the banner. The size was not automatically calculated as we didn't
upload the banner to OpenX Ad Server. So, we have provided the size information
manually for our banner.

As we want this banner to appear dominantly over other banners of the same 
size, which will target the same zone on a website, we have given a high weight
value of 8.
External banners—advantages and disadvantages
Let's see the advantages of External banners:

There are no bandwidth problems, as the images are not served from our servers.
This is the responsibility of the image provider.

It is a very quick process to define an external banner as we deal only with the URL
path of the image.
The following is the only disadvantage:

As images are stored somewhere else, we don't have control over them in most
cases if the image service doesn't give us some kind of FTP permission to manage
image files. If an image is deleted by them or the image server goes down, our
banner will not be shown.
Targeting visitors with banner delivery options
OpenX Ad Server allows us to deliver banners according to several criteria including client, site,
and time information, which is provided by the visitor to the OpenX system automatically.
For example, we can arrange our banner to be shown only to specific visitors originating
from a specific country. For example, the USA or Canada, or to visitors on certain hours or
days; or even to visitors, who use a Google Chrome browser, as an example. It is possible to
block several IP addresses from seeing the advertisements.
Understanding geotargeting
Suppose that we have an electronics review website and we have affiliate links of
Amazon.com for the devices that we review and earn commissions from each sale. We
realize that our eCPM (Earnings for thousand banner impressions) is low in comparison to
industry standards for the electronics market. After a brief investigation, we retrieve the
following chart about the origin of our website visitors over the last six months:

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
Finally, we find that even though we send lots of visitors to the Amazon.com website from
the UK and France, these visitors simply don't buy from Amazon.com or can't buy because
items from the Amazon electronics department are only shipped to US states.
As a solution, we sign up for Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.fr affiliate programs as well and
show the product banners according to the visitor's country of origin. So, a UK visitor sees
only the link for the reviewed device, which targets them to the Amazon.co.uk website,
while a French visitor sees the banners for the Amazon.fr website.
Showing banners according to the origin of the visitor is called geotargeting. It is very
important to use this feature if we have a significant range of visitor countries in order
to increase the profits. OpenX provides a free module for geotargeting at Continent and
Country level.
There are modules prepared for OpenX to extend geotargeting on a smaller level such as
State, City, Zip Code, and so on, but these are paid solutions and not the topic of our book.
We will now see how we can implement geotargeting at country level in this book.

Filling Campaigns with Banners
[ 118 ]
Time for action – Amazon Halloween banner targeting 
US visitors
As you will remember, we had added a special Amazon Halloween campaign that would
run only during the month of October. We had also added an external type banner for this
campaign.
Let's now change this banner to target only the US visitors, and assure that it will be available
between October 20 and October 30; and will be delivered only on the Halloween-related
pages of our site.
Let's assume that we have a site running at http://www.yourwebsite.com and we
have a handful of Halloween-related pages using Halloween keyword in the page URL such
as http://www.yourwebsite.com/halloween-history.html or http://www.
yourwebsite.com/best-halloween-party-supplies.html, and so on.
We will learn how to implement such a campaign banner effectively using banner 
delivery options.
1. 
Click on the tiny arrow near the Default manager link on the top right of any
OpenX page and switch to Administrator account.
2. 
Then, click on the Configuration link on top menu.
3. 
Click on the Geotargeting Settings option on the left-hand side OpenX menu.

We have to be sure that OpenX MaxMind (Flat file) option is selected. If it is
already selected, there is no need to change anything. If not, be sure to select 
this and click on Save Changes.

5. 
Now, let's return to Default manager.

Let's open Inventory and then select advertiser list, campaign list, and
finally banner list under it. Click on the Delivery link near the banner.

Note that we see the preview of our banner there. Click on the Add Delivery
limitation box and choose Geo – Country option, then click on the Add button.

[ 123 ]
14. The next step is to define the start date; 20 October 2009 is later than
or equal to option.
15. Let's add another Time – Date delivery limitation option and set the end date as
30 October 2009. Do not forget to select the is earlier than or equal to option:

[ 124 ]
16. Here is the final screen with all the delivery limitations:
17. Ignore Delivery capping per visitor section for this banner. Now, we can
click on the Save Changes button to finish defining the delivery settings.

Chapter 4
[ 125 ]
What just happened?
Before we started to set geotargeting for US visitors, we became assured that the
geotargeting module is loaded on OpenX Ad Server.
We used Site: Page URL delivery option to include all pages with keyword "Halloween" 
in the URL like the following sample web addresses:
http://www.yourwebsite.com/halloween-history.html
http://www.yourwebsite.com/best-halloween-party-supplies.html 
and, so on.
Now, our banner will be delivered to visitors who visit the web pages that have URLs
containing Halloween text embedded within them.
Delivery capping per visitor for banners is similar to the ones in the campaign section that we
have already covered in the previous chapter. So, we have just ignored it for this example.
Pop quiz– understanding different banner types
Suppose that we have a shared webhosting that gives us low bandwidth and little web space
for files. 
One of our clients asked us to start a few campaigns that will include tens of image banners
in each campaign. They also explained that they can't serve the images from their own
servers because of limited bandwidth there. 
What is the best solution for us to start this client's campaigns with regards to 
this situation?
1.
Use local SQL banner type and store the banners in our database .
2.
Find an affordable image hosting solution, that gives very high bandwidth 
and upload the images there and use External Banner type by directly linking 
to the images .
3.
Use local web server banner type and store the images locally in our
shared webhosting .
4.
Reject the advertiser and state that we can't fulfill their expectations .

Summary
In this chapter, we learned the different types of banners and how to add them on OpenX
Ad Server according to several situations. We have seen how to add the very popular Google
Adsense banner on OpenX. Following that, we learned what geotargeting is, and extended
our knowledge using delivery limitations for banners.
Specifically, we covered:

Different types of banners and how they are processed differently

Advantages and disadvantages of banners

Google Adsense and OpenX

Geotargeting

Delivery limitations for banners
In the next chapter, we will learn about adding websites and zones, linking our banners and
campaigns and serving the ads on our websites. This will complete the essential chapters 
for running a completed OpenX system.

Adding Websites and Zones
OpenX Ad Server allows publishers and advertisers to manage multiple websites
and its zones from a single interface. This increases the efficiency of overall
campaign management, especially on large website networks.
In this chapter, we shall learn the following:

What the zone types are and their differences

How to add a website and a banner type zone

About invocation code and how to apply on our web pages

How to link banners to a zone

Why zone probability screen is vital

Several advanced zone type settings

The importance of dynamic zone sizing

How to add zone invocation codes to Blogger and WordPress

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 128 ]
Websites and zones
A website can have multiple predefined sections to serve advertisements. Each section
is called a zone in OpenX. A zone is simply a placeholder in a website that is allocated for
advertisements. The following screenshot shows a typical web page with three zones, all
serving banners:
Zone types
There are four different types of zones in OpenX system and each is suitable for certain type
of banners. The zone types are as follows:

Banner, button, or rectangle: This is the most widely used zone type and suitable
to show any creative types including images, JavaScript, HTML, and so on. We will
investigate this zone type in detail in this chapter.

Chapter 5
[ 129 ]

Text ad zone type: This zone works only with text banners. Wherever you want to
sell text links on your websites, you should use this zone.

Email/Newsletter zone: Use this zone, if you want to send e-mails and newsletters
to your site subscribers. This zone lets you embed individual advertisement banners
in your e-mails.

Interstitial or floating DHTML: This zone type is used to show floating-or popup-
banners that have dynamic behaviors on the web browser such as appearing/
disappearing after some time, moving with the cursor, and so on. As it is an
advanced type, we will not cover it in this book.
If you are interested in this advanced topic, please search on Google with
phrases such as "Interstitial Banners", "Floating DHTML", "Floating Banners", and
so on.
Adding websites and zones to OpenX
We will now learn how to add websites and zones to OpenX Ad Server by action.
Time for action – adding a website to OpenX
In this section, we will learn how to add our first website where the banners will
be displayed.
1. 
After a brief log in, click on Inventory | Websites | Add new website link.

[ 130 ]
2.
Enter the Website URL and enter the name of your website in the Name field.
Be sure that you write your actual website URL where you want to 
serve advertisements.
3.
Fill Contact and Email fields similar to the following screenshot.
4.
At the end, click on Save changes button to complete website addition process
and return to websites' listings page.
What just happened?
We have learned how to add a new website to OpenX with basic fields. 
Optionally, we could also provide a category, country, and language information. Note that all
the additional fields are purely for informative reasons and have no effect on the operation
of OpenX.

Chapter 5
[ 131 ]
Time for action – adding a banner type zone to website
In this section, we will learn how to add a banner type zone to a website. 
1. 
On Websites listings page, click on Add new zone link. 
2. 
On the next page, we begin with Name field. Note that the zone name field was
automatically filled in as a combination of website name and the keyword Default.
3. 
Fill in the Name field according to the following screenshot:
4. 
After filling in the Name field, write a description for the zone in the
Description field.

[ 132 ]
5. 
Let's look at the Zone type option. The first option Banner, Button or
Rectangle is selected by default. So, no need to change anything here.
6. 
The next step is to select the zone Size. Choose IAB Medium Rectangle
(300x250) option. 
7.
And then, provide some comments in the Comments textbox for the zone.
8.
Finally, click on Save Changes button to finish adding a banner type zone to
 a website.

Chapter 5
[ 133 ]
What just happened?
We have seen how to add a banner zone type to a website. 
Specifically, we have covered the following points:

We have provided a descriptive name according to a common naming convention
template. We have also provided location and zone-size information in name as
well for informative purposes. We have used Global keyword at the end of the
zone name to understand that the zone will be globally available on all pages of
the website. We can understand this later by just looking at the zone name in the
listings. Optionally, we added a description line for the zone.
The drop-down box provided us with all the standard Interactive Advertising Bureau
(IAB) advertisement sizes. We have taken extra care to choose the correct size that
we need for this zone. Remember that the zone and targeted banner sizes should
match. We have chosen a 300x250 zone size here, so only 300x250 sized banners
can be connected to this zone. Optionally, we could assign a customized value for
the zone size, not included in IAB list.

We filled in the comments section to remember extra information about a zone.
Have a go hero – creating another zone for the website
Now, create another 300x250 sized zone with similar settings without looking at the previous
example. Try to give a descriptive name for the new zone.
Zone invocation code
Advertisements are generated on a zone of a website by using a special code that is pasted
into the HTML pages of the website. This code fetches a suitable advertisement from OpenX
server when this web page is browsed by a visitor. There are several invocation code options,
but we will cover only the most popular type. Now, let's see how we get this invocation code
and paste it to our web page.
www.allitebooks.com

[ 134 ]
Time for action – putting zone invocation code into our website
In this section, we will learn how to generate, copy, and paste invocation code into
a web page.
1. 
Click on the name of the zone on Zones listing page. 
2. 
On the next page, we will see the Zone properties. On the top menu,
click on Invocation Code tab.

Chapter 5
[ 135 ]
Now, we are on the invocation code settings page. Note that Javascript Tag
option and invocation Bannercode is automatically selected. If not, first select
JavaScript Tag option and apply Select All on the code text. Right-click on the
code and select Copy.

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 136 ]
3.
It is now time to create or open a sample HTML file. We will need to paste
this code into the section where we want the advertisements to appear.
In this example, we opened sample.htm and pasted the code after the
second paragraph of the HTML file. Do the same. Create a sample.
htm file and paste the code somewhere near the beginning.

Chapter 5
[ 137 ]
4. 
The next step is to upload the file to our web server. We can use an FTP client
such as Core FTP.
5. 
Let's  now check how our page looks on the web server:

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 138 ]
What just happened?
We have seen how to get zone invocation code and paste to the page where we want the
advertisements to appear. Next, we have uploaded the file to web server and checked how 
it looked.
We have already covered the topic of uploading a file to a web server with an FTP client in 
the first chapter of the book. You should read the example again if any difficulties occur.
Note that the place where we have put our code looks empty in the browser. It was shown
in the previous screenshot with a red area. The reason is that we didn't link any campaign or
banners targeting this place. Let's do this now!
We can define as many zones as we want on a single HTML page. This way, we
can deliver multiple advertisements on different positions of a web page.
Time for action – linking a banner to a zone
In this section, we will learn how to link a banner to a zone and check how the advertisement
will appear on the website.
1. 
Click on Linked Banners tab on Zone Properties page. 
2. 
Select Link individual banners option for zone-linking section.

Chapter 5
[ 139 ]
3. 
The next step is to browse advertiser, campaign, and banners sections until we
find our banner. In this example, we have chosen Google from advertisers list.
4. 
We have selected Google – Adsense (1 banner(s)) campaign.
5. 
Then select Google Adsense 300x250 Banner.

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 140 ]
6. 
After selection, click on the tiny arrow on the right-hand side to complete linking
300x250 Adsense banner to 300x250 zone.
7. 
The banner is now linked to the zone, which is shown in the following screenshot:
8. 
Wait for around 10 minutes and browse into the website where you have uploaded
the page with embedded zone code. Now, we see our banner is there and working.

Chapter 5
[ 141 ]
What just happened?
We had initially learned how to link a banner to a web zone and then checked its 
appearance on the zone. Here we have seen how we could choose individual banners to link.
Note that we have waited for a while before checking our banner on the web page. The
reason for this waiting time is that OpenX system caches all the banners and applies the
changes at certain intervals.
Pop quiz – understanding banner zone linking
Decide whether the following statements are true:
1. We can add as many different zone invocation codes as we want on the same page
of a website.

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 142 ]
2.
Several banners from multiple advertisers and campaigns with the size of 728x90
can be linked to any number of zones with the size of 728x90 on multiple websites.
3.
If we link a campaign to a zone, all the banners inside the campaign will also be
automatically linked to this zone.
4.
A Google Adsense banner (300x250) and an Amazon image banner (300x250) 
can be both linked to a zone of 300x250.
5.
We can link a 300x250 sized banner to the 350x250 sized zone.
Have a go hero – linking another Amazon banner to this zone
Now, start another sample Amazon campaign with a banner of the same size (300x250). Link
to the same zone that we have just created. Let's understand zone probabilities now.
Understanding zone probablities
Zone probabilities are the approximate percentages that tell us how many times the banners
will be delivered. We will now learn how different campaigns, banner priorities, and weights
affect the zone probabilities. The probability tab is used to see this information for a zone.
Scenario 1: Only one banner in the zone
The following screenshot shows a Remnant Google Adsense campaign that gets all the
impressions, as it is the only banner in this zone, that is, it has 100 percent probability:
Scenario 2: Two Remnant type banners from the same campaign
Look at the following fictitious scenario. Note that as the banners are from the same
campaign, the only factor that affects the probability is the weight of individual banners:

Chapter 5
[ 143 ]
Scenario 3: Two Contract Banners and One Remnant Banner
First of all, investigate the following fictitious zone probability screenshot and then read
the explanation:
Priority is calculated as a combination of campaign and banner weights.
In this scenario, we have added two contract banners from the same campaign. So, the
priorities of the banners are the same but individual banners compete with their own weight.
As the priority of the campaign is five for both banners, let's check individual weight of
each banner. 

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 144 ]
As you see, the second banner has a weight that is two times the weight of the first banner 
and it is the only factor that affects total probability. Remember that they are from the 
same campaign.
Finally, the remnant campaign is almost neglected and not delivered at all. It is an expected
behavior. We know that remnant campaigns will be delivered only if there are no contract
and contract (exclusive) campaigns on the same zone. 
The 0.10 percent probability tells us that the remnant banner has a chance to be shown 
and will reach 100 percent delivery if both the upper contract banners reach their daily 
limit (let's say, 50 clicks a day). 
Other options such as banner delivery limitations, capping per visitor and campaign
positioning also affect the probabilities.
Note that probabilities are never fixed and they change over time according to delivery
statistics. OpenX system tries to optimize the delivery of the banners and shows only
approximations on the screen.
Adding zones in Blogger and WordPress blogs
It is very easy to define zones on popular blogging platforms such as Blogger and WordPress.
Putting zone invocation codes in templates make the advertisements globally available in all
pages of blogs and we can effectively manage the campaigns on the blogs.
Time for action – adding zone invocation code to blogger
In this section, we will learn how to put zone invocation code to blogger using the gadgets.
Blogger is a free blogging platform run by Google. We can register and open a
blog easily on www.blogger.com
1. 
After we log into our Blogger account, let's browse into Layout | Page
Elements screen.

2. 
Let's choose one of the gadgets to add. Click on Add a Gadget link.
3. 
Click on HTML/JavaScript option from the list.

4. 
Paste the zone invocation code in the Content box and click on SAVE button.
5. 
We have now successfully added zone invocation code to the blogger as an
HTML/JavaScript widget.

Chapter 5
[ 147 ]
What just happened?
We have seen how to define and add zone codes to blogger. Now, the campaign
advertisements that are linked to this zone will be delivered on this section of the blog. We
can manage the advertisements on the blog without any change in blog template, by using
just OpenX campaign management screens later.
We can add zone invocation code to blogger HTML template directly, as well. For
example, you can embed zones into individual blog posts as a template.
Time for action – adding zone invocation code to a
WordPress blog
In this section, we will learn how to put zone invocation code into a WordPress installation
using widgets.
WordPress is one of the most popular free blogging tools on the Internet. You
can download the latest WordPress files and install on your server at www.
WordPress.org or start a free hosted blog at www.WordPress.com.
1. 
Let's log into our WordPress admin screen and browse into
Appearance | Widgets menu.

[ 148 ]
2. Let's drag-and-drop Text widget element from the left to the Sidebar 3 section on
the right.
3. A new Text window will be opened. Let's paste the copied zone invocation
text on this place and click on Save button. Then click on Close.

Chapter 5
[ 149 ]
4. We have completed adding zone invocation code to a WordPress blog. 
What just happened?
We have seen how to add a zone code to the WordPress blog. Once we have set up zones
on our blog, we don't need to change them anymore. We can manage all campaigns for the
zones using OpenX administration panel.
You can add zone invocation code to WordPress HTML templates directly using
WordPress file editor for more control on where the advertisements should
appear; such as embedding zones into individual blog posts.
Understanding advanced zone properties
Advanced zone properties provides us useful extra control over how a zone will operate. 

Zone chaining: Zone chaining is a technique that helps us ensure that a zone is
never empty, that is, it will always have at least a banner to display. If you didn't
assign a remnant campaign for a zone, eventually a contract campaign will be totally
delivered and the zone will not show any advertisements. To protect this situation
on the zone level, we can instruct OpenX to get the banners from another zone if
the original zone has no banners to show.

Delivery capping per visitor: Delivery capping per visitor allows us to set a limit 
on how many times zone banners will be shown to a unique visitor. Actually, we
don't need to use this setting except in extreme situations because it is better to set
banner delivery capping per visitor as we have seen in previous chapter.

Zone appending: Zone appending is useful if we want to deliver something globally
before or after a banner in a zone, regardless of the source of the banner.

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 150 ]
Time for action – setting advanced zone properties
In this section, we will do activities for zone chaining, delivery capping per visitor, and
zone appending.
1. 
Click on the zone we have previously created in zone listings in order
to open zone properties. Then click on the Advanced tab.
2.
We are starting with Chain settings. The default setting is Stop delivery and
don't show a banner when there are no banners to show for a zone.
3. Let's click on Display the selected zone instead option and select one of the
available zones.
Note that we should have at least one zone in the same website with the same
width and height values to make zone chaining available.
4. 
Enter 5 as a value for Limit zone views to option. 

Chapter 5
[ 151 ]
5.
Now, let's apply a simple zone appending. First check Prepend/Append even if no
banner delivered option. Then, add the HTML shown in the screenshot as it is.
<a href="http://www.openx.org">OpenX Official Website</a>
6.
Finally, click on Save Changes button to save advanced setting information

[ 152 ]
7.
Now, wait for some time and browse into same sample.htm file that we have
previously uploaded. Look at the following screenshot to see how the 
appended HTML code will appear:
What just happened?
We have learned how to apply advanced settings for the zone. This included zone chaining,
delivery capping per visitor, and zone appending.
Specifically we have covered the following in Time for action steps:
1.
We have seen that it is wise to apply chain setting for inventory optimization and
visual purposes on our sites.
2.
We have noticed that only the same sized zones can be chained.

Chapter 5
[ 153 ]
3.
According to this setting, the banners from this zone will be shown to a visitor only
five times and once the limit is reached,the zone must not show any  more banners.
But remember that we have set a zone chain previously and now OpenX will attempt
to bring a banner from the chained zone for the sixth impression.
4.
We have added a link to our website in HTML section, which will be displayed
under the zone. Note that whatever the banner is, this HTML link will be shown 
for all times in this zone. As we have checked Prepend/Append even if no banner
delivered, our HTML will be still shown even though there are no banners to deliver
for the zone.
Dynamic zone sizes
There are times when we want to have a dynamically sized zone. Let's look at the following
common scenario, which most publishers find difficult to solve.
Suppose we have a zone at the top of our page, which is sized to 300x250 and is serving
exactly 300x250 sized banners for some campaigns. 
One day a new advertiser offers to put a 250x250 sized banner over this area. We know that
zone and banner sizes should match, but we also don't want to reject the advertiser. The
solution is to convert this zone to a dynamic zone that accepts both 300x250 and 250x250
banners. Let's learn how to achieve such an action.
Time for action – applying dynamic zone sizes
In this section, we will learn how to apply a dynamic zone to allow different sized banners.
1.
Open Zone Properties screen and scroll down until you see the Size section.
2. Fill the Width and Height fields as shown in the following screenshot.
Do not forget to click on Save Changes after changing width.
3. Let's try to link a 250x250 and a 300x250 banner to this zone to test
dynamic zone sizing.

Adding Websites and Zones
[ 154 ]
4. If you haven't done it yet, add a 250x250 banner to one of OpenX campaigns
that already has a 300x250 banner. You can use Apple – Mac Devices
campaign that we have previously created to add another banner. We
assume that we have two such banners and continue with linking.
5. Click on Linked Banners tab on Zone properties screen.
6. 
We had already linked our 300x250 sized Google Adsense banner to this zone.
We can see it in the listed screenshot:
7. 
Let's select Link individual banners option. 

Chapter 5
[ 155 ]
8. 
Then, let's browse until we see all the suitable banners in Apple – Mac
Devices campaign.
Note that our newly added 250x250 banner is listed together with the other
300x250 Mac banner on the campaign. We can link this banner to this zone as well.
So, dynamic zone sizing works as expected.
What just happened?
We have seen how to solve fixed zone sizing problem using the dynamic zone sizing option. 
It lets us accept different sized banners for a zone.
Specifically for this example, we have applied * to the width of the zone and it allowed us 
to link different sized 300x250 and 250x250 banners.
Pop quiz – understanding dynamic zone sizes
Which of the following banners can be shown on a dynamically sized banner type zone with
a width of * and height of 60? Check all that apply:
a.
A local SQL Banner with a size of 120x60
b.
An HTML banner with a size of 125x125
c.
An HTML banner with a size of 728x60
d.
A text link banner

Summary
In this chapter, we have completed serving advertisements s on a website zone. It involved
three important steps—Choosing the correct zone type according to our needs, putting
invocation code correctly on a web page, and finally linking the banners to the needed zone.
We have also seen how to effectively serve different sized banners to a zone. Dynamic zones
enable publishers to become more flexible to the different advertisers' needs. Do not forget
to check the zone probability screen occasionally to ensure that the needed banners are being
delivered correctly.
In the next chapter, we will learn how we can target our zones according to content
channels, which will make it simpler for us to serve relevant advertisements according 
to content.

6
Taking Advantage of Channels
Most advertisers seek content targeting on the websites for their
advertisements to get more valuable click-through rates (as a result of relevant
advertisements) and hence, more returns on advertisements. So, it is essential
for publishers to define content-specific labeled zones on their websites to
increase their advertising sales rates and so, in turn, their revenue.
In this chapter, we shall learn:

What Site Source parameter is and how it helps determine content identification 
for banners

How to use Site Source parameter for banner and zone linking

What channels are, their types, and their advantages over Site Source parameter

How to use the website channel to achieve targeting

How to use the global channel to understand multiple website content targeting

[ 158 ]
Site Source
A website zone can be labeled with a parameter called Site Source. It enables the advertisers
to show banners according to this Site Source parameter which is used as a label for the
content on the zone of a website.
Let's think about a technology review blog, which publishes articles about the latest devices
and hi-tech innovations. Typically, ad spaces would be labeled according to blog categories
such as robots, mobile phones, HDTVs, and so on. In the best case, the zones of this blog
should show relevant ads.
Now, let's see how we achieve such labeling with Site Source parameter.
Time for action – labeling zones with site source parameter
In this section, we will learn how to label a zone with Site Source parameter.
Suppose we have an electronics review website and we want to target a New iMac
advertisement exclusively to a notebook reviews section. In other words, this banner should
appear only on the targeted places of our site. Let's see now how we can accomplish this
using Site Source parameter.
1.
After you log in, click on Inventory and then Websites link on the left-hand
side menu. Click on Zones link near yourwebsite.com website that we have
created previously.

write notebook-reviews in the Source field under Tag settings section.
4. Do not change the other fields. Then, click on Refresh button.

5. 
The next step is to right-click on the refreshed, selected code and
choose the Copy option.

[ 162 ]
6. Create an HTML file on your computer and name the file as
notebook-reviews-test.htm.
7. Edit the file with notepad and write the following one line HTML code
    Notebook reviews sample page <br>
Then paste the copied zone invocation code below it. Do not forget to save the
HTML file after editing.
8. The following screenshot shows the edited notebook-reviews-test.htm file:
9. Return to OpenX screen and find the Source field again where you have written
notebook-reviews as a text. Clear the text and write iphone-news this time.
10. Click on the Refresh button at the bottom of the page.

Chapter 6
[ 163 ]
10. The rest of the process is similar to the previous one. The next step is
to right-click on the refreshed, selected code and copy the code.

[ 164 ]
11. Create another HTML file on your computer and name the file as iphone-news-
test.htm.Edit the file with notepad and write the following line of HTML code:
    iPhone News sample page <br>
Now paste the newly copied zone invocation code below it. Do not forget to save the
HTML file after editing. The following screenshot shows the edited iphone-news-
test.htm file:
12. The next step is to upload these two HTML files to our web server where we
want to show the advertisements.
13. Use a free FTP client such as Core FTP (or cPanel file manager) and upload the
files to the root folder of the web server.

Chapter 6
[ 165 ]
14. The next step is to link the previously added 300x250_New_iMac banner.
Let's browse in OpenX until we get to the Banner Properties page of 
this banner. Then click on the Linked Zones link on the top menu.

the pages like the following screenshots. The notebook reviews page continues to
show the banner (http://yourwebsite.com/notebook-reviews-test.htm):

Taking Advantage of Channels
[ 170 ]
21. On the other hand, the iPhone news page doesn't show the banner
anymore (http://yourwebsite.com/iphone-news-test.htm):
What just happened?
We have learned how to apply Site Source parameter for targeting banners according to
content type. 
Specifically we have covered this in Time for action steps: 

As you may notice when we previewed two HTML files by a web browser; note
that our banners appeared on both HTML pages that use notebook-reviews and
iphone-news source parameters inside the invocation code. This is an expected
behavior as we only linked the banners to the same zone without any targeting
limitations according to the source parameter

We then defined a delivery limitation for linking the banner to the zone. We
stated that the banner should appear only when the targeted zone has Site Source
parameter as notebook_reviews.

When we browse both the HTML pages, we see that only notebook-reviews-
test.htm shows the banner. It is an expected behavior because of the
targeting with Site Source parameter as notebook-reviews in banner delivery
limitation settings.
Channels
Although the Site Source parameter provides a great advantage to target zones according 
to content labels, it has a major drawback. Suppose that we work with tens, even hundreds
of banners. It is quite possible that we could write a wrong Site – Source delivery limitation
name mistakenly when defining delivery limitations. This results in the banner not being
served at all because there is no such Site Source parameter on the zone! To protect such
direct typing errors and better management, we use channels. We can think of channels as a
middle pipe, connecting banners to target zones labeled with sources.

Chapter 6
[ 171 ]
The following scenario shows that all five banners are linked to the zone of a website with a
Site Source of LCD HDTVs, using a channel. All we need to do is change Channel 1 Site Source
to Plasma HDTVs to link banners to the same zone with another Site Source value without
modifying any of the banner delivery limitation properties.
There are two types of channels that we can use for content targeting:
Website channel
These channels are defined for a website and are valid only for the zones of the defined
website. Banners linked to a zone in the same website can use these channels, which means
that you cannot bind banners on multiple website zones using a website channel. We will
soon provide such global channel functionality , but before that, let's learn more about
website channels.

Taking Advantage of Channels
[ 178 ]
12. Note that the banner has disappeared from the iPhone news test page, 
(http://yourwebsite.com/iphone-news-test.htm).
What just happened?
We have seen how to use a website channel type for content targeted ads. 
Specifically, we have covered the following: 

We added a website channel for our zone and named it as ch_notebook.
Note that we used ch_ parameter to understand that it is a website channel.

We connected this channel to the website zone labeled with notebook_reviews
Site Source parameter.

We have opened the delivery limitations screen for our banner. First, we deleted
the old Site Source parameter for the banner. Second, we added ch_notebook to
delivery limitations. This way, we also linked our banner to notebook_reviews
labelled website zone indirectly.

As the last step, we reviewed our sample web pages and observed that only
notebook-reviews-test.htm page shows the banner as expected.
Global channel
This channel type can be used for any zones on any websites owned by a Manager account.
This channel enables OpenX managers to link any banners to any zone without using direct
banner zone linking.

[ 183 ]
What just happened?
We have seen how to add a Global Channel type. 
Specifically, we have covered the following: 

We opened my account link and then opened the targeting channel management
screen. We added a global channel named as gch_notebook. Note that 
gch_ prefix was used for the naming convention purpose and is a short name for
global channel.

We then declared the Site Source as notebook_reviews in the delivery limitation
settings of the channel.

Any zone in any website becomes available to banner linking in this account, if its
Source parameter is defined as notebook_reviews. In other words, any banner
which uses this global channel can be connected to these zones.

Finally, we observed that gch_notebook is available in our banner delivery
limitation settings. If you further investigate the other banners, you will see that
gch_notebook channel is available for every banner irrespective of whether the
banners are linked to a specific zone or not!.
Have a go hero – testing global channel behavior
Now, it is time to see whether you can achieve website content targeting using global
channels for multiple websites. Create another website definition in OpenX and try to
connect a banner to multiple websites, but to the same content zones, using the just created
global channel.
If you don't have another website, you can still add the same website
with a different name in OpenX Ad Server, but the zone invocation codes
will be totally different.
Pop quiz – understanding channels
Decide whether the following statements are true or false:
a.
A zone invocation code can have only one Site Source parameter inside
b.
A banner can be connected to multiple content zones at the same time using 
more than one Site – Channel parameter
c.
Direct usage of Site Source parameter for banners is a wiser way of usage rather
than using Site – Channels

d. Channels can be limited according to Site Source parameter. It is not possible to add,

Summary
A modern advertising solution needs to deliver advertisements according to the content of
website sections. We have learnt how to build an easy-to-use content targeting system by using
channels. If you have only a few websites, you can use a website channel. The common practice
is to identify channels according to website categories. On the other hand; we have seen how
the publishers who have many websites, can achieve easy targeting on multiple websites by
using global channels. Using channels, you can clearly increase your advertising rates.
In the next chapter, we will learn using advanced account settings and the management of 
multiple accounts.

OpenX Account Management
OpenX account system perfectly provides a multiuser management service
for ad serving business. This system enables advertisers, publishers, and
advertising agency managers to work in one OpenX system exclusively with
separate and personalized rights.
In this chapter, we shall learn:

Account types and their differences

Adding a manager account

Different uses of manager account

Adding an advertiser account

Uses of advertiser account
OpenX account types
There are four types of accounts that we can use in OpenX Ad Server. We can think of
account type as similar to user roles, thus specifying permissions for several actions on a user
login level. Each account type can have multiple users to log in and use OpenX environment.

Administrator account: 
Administrator account is the power user for an installed OpenX Ad Server
system and has all the rights over advertisers, campaigns, banners, websites, 
and zones. Besides these rights, an administrator is able to change global settings
and maintain them. An administrator account is created by default on OpenX Ad 
Server installation.

OpenX Account Management
[ 186 ]

Manager account: 
A manager account has all the rights over the advertisers and websites that are
created under its name. All manager accounts are separate and cannot access
account management domains of others  and global OpenX settings. 

Website account: 
A website account is defined for a certain website by a manager account. A website
account has the rights to create new zones and link banners to the zones under a
certain website defined by the manager account.

Advertiser account: 
An advertiser account is also defined for a certain advertiser by a manager account.
An advertiser account can view campaigns, activate/deactivate banners, and modify
banners for a certain advertiser defined by the manager account. 
The following diagram shows the relationship between different types of accounts:

(User : Mike)
(User : Jack)
(User : Kim)
(User : Ann)
(User : Julie)
(User : Admin)
(User : John)
(User : Marie)
According to the previous diagram, we can conclude the following facts about these users
and their permissions:

User John has rights on both manager accounts, so he can manage any advertiser
and website on both manager accounts.

As user Marie is not linked to Manager Account 2, she cannot access or have any
information about—for example, www.sample3.com. On the other hand, she can
manage www.sample1.com and www.sample2.com, Apple Inc advertiser, and any
other items listed under Manager Account 1.

Chapter 7
[ 187 ]

Users Mike and Kim only can access www.sample1.com settings and change zones
and link banners if permissions are provided by Users John or Marie.

User Ann is only able to manage Apple Inc. advertiser and is not able to access any
other websites or advertisers on both manager accounts.
As we already have a default administrator account upon installation, we will start with
manager accounts and see how we can create a manager account.
Working with manager accounts
We will now learn how to define another manager account on OpenX Ad Server and will see
why we need more than one manager account.
Time for action – adding a manager account
In this scenario, we suppose that another website network owner wants to use our OpenX
Ad Server system for a monthly fee to serve advertisements on his/her website. He/she also
wants to be able to add any number of advertisers and websites under his/her login that we
will provide.

17. Click on the arrow in the top right OpenX menu to switch to another account, but
you can see that only Manager Account 2 is available and there is no administrator
account listed.

Chapter 7
[ 195 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to add a manager account to allow another person to use our OpenX
Ad Server environment.
In the previous procedure, we performed the following activities: 

We changed into administrator account. We added a manager account and 
named it as Manager Account 2.

We have added a manager2 as a user under the Manager Account 2. Note that 
we didn't give permission to this user to be able to create additional users under 
this account. 

Remember that each account can have more than one user defined under it. You
can think of accounts as similar to user groups. While a user carries the common
properties of his/her account type, they can also get individual rights under the
account type.

We have seen that the administrator account can manage both default manager 
and Manager Account 2 accounts. 

We have changed into the default manager account and have seen that previously
added advertisers are there. If we further investigate, we will see websites, zones,
along with everything that we have previously created.

As the final step, we have made logout from default OpenX admin user and made a
login using manager2 user. This time, we have seen that that advertisers' screen was
empty. This is normal, an expected behavior because every manager account can
see and use only its working environment. 

We also noticed that the newly created manager account cannot reach to the
administrator account now.

Now, the manager2 user, being completely isolated from our default working area
and others, is ready to use OpenX Ad Server. This user can now create any number
of advertisers and websites, and can start ad serving on them. The other manager
accounts will not see what this account is doing!

OpenX Account Management
[ 196 ]
Working with advertiser accounts
We will now learn how to define an account and user on the advertiser level using the
advertiser account type. 
Time for action – adding an advertiser account
In this fictional scenario, we assume that we want to give rights to an Apple Inc. advertising
specialist to be able to change the banners in the campaigns, and to activate and deactivate
according to their wishes. He/she should not see any other advertisers and websites on the
OpenX Ad Server system. Logically, we also don't want the specialist to be able to stop any
campaigns without our knowledge as we have been paid for them! So, he/she must not have 
such permission.
1. 
Let's start entering the system with our default OpenX login that we have created
upon installation.

Chapter 7
[ 197 ]
2. 
Switch to Default manager account.
3. 
Click on Apple Inc. advertiser's name, or any other advertiser, if you haven't added
this in the previous chapters.

OpenX Account Management
[ 198 ]
4. 
Click on the User Access link on Advertiser Properties screen.
5. 
Open the Actions menu on the top right corner and click on Add user link.
6. 
Write specialist1 in the Username of user to add field on User Access screen and
then click on Add user button.

Chapter 7
[ 199 ]
7. 
Fill in Username, Password, Repeat password, Contact Name, Email, and
Language fields accordingly.

OpenX Account Management
[ 200 ]
8.
On the Permissions screen, uncheck Allow this user to create new accounts and
Allow this user to access the audit trail options. Leave the other options checked
at default settings. Click on the Add user button to complete adding the user.
9. 
The following screenshot shows the added specialist1 user:
10. Log out from the OpenX Ad Server.

Chapter 7
[ 201 ]
11. Log in to OpenX using specialist1 user.
You can see that Campaigns under Apple Inc. are listed as in the following screenshot:

OpenX Account Management
[ 202 ]
12. Click on the Banners link for one of the campaigns and see the list of
banners as in the following screenshot:
13. Try switching to another account by clicking on the tiny arrow in the top right
menu of OpenX. 

Chapter 7
[ 203 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to add an advertiser account to provide access to certain advertisers
for specialists.
We performed the following activities in the previous procedure:

We switched to default manager account from administrator account.

We have browsed until we can see the advertiser properties page of Apple Inc.
Then we have clicked on the user access tab.

We have then created the specialist1 user and have provided certain permissions.
These included the ability to activate/deactive banners and change banner properties.

We have logged out from the system and logged in using specialist1 user. We have
seen the campaigns available under Apple Inc. Note that this user cannot start a
new campaign, delete one, or deactivate one.

Next, we have browsed banners listing under a campaign. Note that the user cannot
add new banners or delete existing banners. The permission is limited to activate/
deactivate and change banner properties. This behavior is great for controlling the
campaigns for a manager account.
Have a go hero – adding a website account
Now, let's test our understanding of the account type system of OpenX. In this scenario, we
want to allow a website owner to be able to create zones, take invocation code, and link
available banners from the system solely for her/his website in the OpenX system. The new
user must not be able to create any new website, advertiser, campaign, or banner. Carefully
look at the Website Properties screen for a website to find User Access option.

OpenX Account Management
[ 204 ]
Accounts and permissions chart
The following chart briefly shows all the permissions for the account types in the
OpenX system:
Pop quiz – understanding OpenX account management
Decide whether the following statements are true or not:
a.
We are able to add a user on a campaign or banner level. 
b.
If we delete a manager account using the administrator account, all websites,
advertisers, channels, and other accounts defined under this manager account are
deleted as well. 

Chapter 7
[ 205 ]
c.
If we delete a user linked to a manager account using the administrator account,
all websites, advertisers, channels, and other accounts defined under this manager
account are deleted as well. 
d.
A user login can be linked to multiple accounts. For example, to a website account
under a manager account 1 and an advertiser account under a manager account 2.
Summary
In this chapter, we have seen how we can take advantage of account types for providing
multiple user access with permission levels on administrator, manager, website, and
advertiser. By using different accounts, you can open your OpenX Ad Server system for the
clients and for your in-house employees.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to change user and account properties, set banner
preferences, and audit the OpenX Ad server to track changes made by different users.

User and Account Preferences
OpenX provides an additional preferences section to provide more control 
with regards to how an account will behave and show default settings.
In this chapter, we shall learn:

Changing the name, e-mail, and password for a user 

Defining default banner preferences

Changing the time zone for an account

Checking user logs for auditing events and other users under an account
Changing OpenX name, e-mail, and password
We will now learn how to change the name, e-mail, and password of a user.

User and Account Preferences
[ 208 ]
Time for action – changing OpenX name, e-mail, and password
1. 
Click on My Account, then click on Name & Language under User Preferences menu.
2. 
Change Full Name according to your choice and click on Save Changes button.
3. 
Click on Change E-Mail under User Preferences menu.

[ 210 ]
5. 
Click on Change Password under User Preferences menu.
6. 
Type your Current Password, then Choose a new password and
Re-enter new password. Click on Save Changes button.

Chapter 8
[ 211 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to change the name, e-mail, and password for an account on 
OpenX Ad Server.
Specifically, we have covered the following Time for Action steps:

We learned how to change the name for a user. Actually, we could also change the
OpenX screens language for the user. OpenX supports a multi-language environment
for many widely-used worldwide languages. It is a useful setting if you have a team
of specialists from different countries.

We have changed the e-mail of the user. Note that we have provided our current
password as an extra security check before this change.

We have changed our password. It required providing the old password for security
and retyping the new password to prevent typing mistakes for the new password.
Banner preferences
We will now learn how to define default banners and default weight values for the account.
This way, we can guarantee that a default banner will be shown to visitors even if there are
no banners to be delivered in the inventory.
Time for action – changing banner preferences
1. 
Click on Banner Preferences link under Preferences menu in My Account menu.

User and Account Preferences
[ 212 ]
2.
In Default Banners section, write Default Image URL and Default Destination URL
of one of your banners in OpenX system.
3.
In Default Weight section, write any number between 1 to 10 for both Default
Banner Weight and Default Campaign Weight fields. Click on Save Changes button.
4. 
Go to Banners section and click on Add new banner link under any of
the campaigns.

Chapter 8
[ 213 ]
5. 
Scroll down on the banner screen. Note that 4 was written in Weight field as default.
What just happened?
We have learned how to change banner preferences for an account.
The default banners section is very useful to prevent visitors seeing blank pages when there
are no banners to show. In this situation, the banner that we have defined here will be
shown by default.

User and Account Preferences
[ 214 ]
When a default weight has been chosen for a banner or campaign, all new banners 
and campaigns under this account will have default weight numbers according to 
these parameters.
According to this example, all new campaigns and banners will have 4 as the default weight
which can be changed by the user.
Time zone preferences
Selection of the time zone affects the delivery and reports of the campaigns and banners. 
So, it should be properly defined for each account.
Time for action – changing time zone preferences
1. 
Click on Timezone Preferences link under Preferences menu in My Account tab.
2. 
Select from available time zones and click on Save Changes button.

Chapter 8
[ 215 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to change Time Zone Preferences for an account. Note that different
accounts can have different time zone settings. It indicates that all campaigns and banners
under an account behave according to the selected time zone.
For example, let's suppose that the manager account defined GMT+3 as the time zone and
he/she has a banner that works according to Time-Hour of day delivery limitation. If this
delivery limitation is set to work 09:00 to 18:00, the OpenX system will use GMT+3 time zone
setting as a reference.

User and Account Preferences
[ 216 ]
If he/she wants to show this banner to visitors of another country, let's say A (let's say in
GMT+1 time zone) in exactly the same hours in the local country time 09:00 to 18:00 then, it
is necessary to define a delivery combination of Time and GeoTargeting—Country: 07:00 to
16:00 and Country A because of the two hour time difference.
Another alternative solution is to open another account and set the time zone GMT + 1 
and copy the banner exactly with 09:00 to 18:00 time limitation.
User logs
The user logs section is a handy tool to check what actions the users under an account are
performing on the OpenX System. We can also track the changed history of any advertiser,
campaign, banner, website, and zone.
Time for action – checking user logs
1. 
Click on User Log link under My Account menu.
We will see a screenshot similar to the following:

Chapter 8
[ 217 ]
2. 
Select an advertiser from the Filters list and view the details of any event. 

User and Account Preferences
[ 218 ]
3. We should see the Event Details similar to the following screenshot:
What just happened?
We have learned how to audit users under an account using user logs. User logs also 
provide filters on advertisers, campaigns, and websites. We can further investigate user 
logs according to additional date filter.
Have a go hero – exploring user interface preferences
Now we have seen the most effective and widely used user and account preferences on
the OpenX system. 

Chapter 8
[ 219 ]
Investigate preferences menu more on to find out other available preferences options and
what additionally we can change on an user interface.
Pop quiz – understanding user and account preferences
Decide whether the following statements are true or false:
a.
All accounts on an OpenX server will be affected if we define a default banner 
image and destination URL under the administrator account in the banner
preferences section.
b.
Each account can have different time zone preference values.
c.
A website or advertiser account can reach users', logs (Audit trail) if permission is
given by a manager account. 
Summary
We have seen that OpenX provides us with tools to differentiate the behavior of accounts
using preferences. We have additionally learnt how to set different time zones for accounts
and how to audit user changes and track what's going on in the system overall.
In the next chapter, we will learn about upgrading to the latest OpenX version.

OpenX version to our computer as an archive. We have uploaded this archive file to our
server using the cPanel file manager tool. We have extracted the file to its default folder.
Finally, we have renamed the folder with a _newfiles suffix, which will remind us that
these are the files of the new OpenX version.
Another method for uploading files and renaming them is through the FTP client.
If you prefer, you can get more information about uploading files to the server
with CoreFTP Lite (free ftp client) in Chapter 1.

the _newfiles suffix.
Have a go hero – the upgrading process: advanced features
Now, go and download the conf.php file on your computer and explore the content. In case
you forget your MySQL database connection information for the OpenX installation, you can
find this information in this file.
Pop quiz – understanding the process of upgrading OpenX
Suppose that we have completed the upgrade wizard successfully, but in the next step we
have forgotten to rename old and new folder paths accordingly. Will the banners still be
served on the website zones on to which they are linked?
Summary
We have seen that upgrading OpenX Ad Server is very similar to its installation. Moreover,
we should be very careful on a few issues. These were correctly copying configuration file,
banner image files to their new places and changing the installation locations. Do not forget
to check for updates regularly. This will help you to avoid possible vulnerabilities on your
system and taking advantage of future releases.
In the final chapter of the book, we will learn how to track statistics online, get special
reports and analyze data on a spreadsheet.


10
Using Reports and Statistics
OpenX provides a very detailed and useful statistics and reports mechanism to
evaluate the progress as well as performance of any campaign. OpenX reports
and statistics tools have the ability to retrieve data on several groupings such as
advertisers, campaigns, banners, websites, and zones.
In this chapter, we shall learn:
• 
How to view advertisers and campaign statistics
• 
How to export data to Excel for further analysis
• 
Types of advanced OpenX reports
• 
How to retrieve advertising analysis reports using Excel
Advertisers and campaigns statistics
It is the default OpenX statistics type. It provides current statistics of all advertisers under an
account. It is also possible to retrieve statistics according to start and end dates.

Using Reports and Statistics
[ 250 ]
Time for action – getting advertisers and campaign statistics
Now, let's learn how to get the statistics for a certain advertiser and the campaigns under it.
We will then see how to analyze them on a spreadsheet.
1. 
Click on Statistics menu item. Advertisers & Campaigns screen should
automatically open. If not, click on Advertisers & Campaigns link.
2.
Now, we should be able to see current date's statistics as a default for all the
advertisers under an account. Note that following screenshots are from a real
OpenX Ad Server implementation and do not necessarily have to match  
with your screens.
3. 
Let's view all the statistics for the advertiser, starting from the installation
of OpenX Ad Server. Select All statistics option from the date list.

[ 255 ]
12. We can now see the banner history on a daily basis sorted according to clicks.
Let's sort it according to Day column as shown in the following screenshot:

Using Reports and Statistics
[ 256 ]
13. Let's click on Export Statistics to Excel link on the top of the statistics.
14. OpenX Ad Server automatically generated an Excel (.xls) file for us.
Let's open it with Excel.
Alternatively, if you don't have MS Excel, you can download and use Open Office
for free from www.openoffice.org. You can achieve everything in further
examples using Open Office as well. 

Chapter 10
[ 257 ]
15. Let's select three columns from the spreadsheet—Day, Impressions, and
Clicks columns in the spreadsheet. Then, let's insert a chart by choosing
Insert | Column | 3-D Column.

Using Reports and Statistics
[ 258 ]
16. We can now see that a chart is created and shows the progress of clicks and
impressions over a period of time.
17. Let's see clicks progressing only by time. To achieve this, right-click on the
chart and choose Select Data… option.

Chapter 10
[ 259 ]
18. Then choose Impressions column, click on Remove button, and Finally click on OK
button to complete the process.
19. We can now see only data pertaining to progress of number of clicks 
on the chart as shown in the following screenshot. Note that the Days row is
decreasing over time. This is due to order of the data selected before the 
chart retrieval. 

Using Reports and Statistics
[ 260 ]
20. Let's return to statistics screen and click on Website Distribution tab.
21. Now, we can see how the statistics for the banner was distributed among
the websites.
22. Click on the tiny arrow near a website name and we can see how the statistics are
distributed among the zones under the website. 

Chapter 10
[ 261 ]
What just happened?
We started with advertiser level statistics and progressed into banner level step by step.
During this process, we learned how effective advertisers and campaigns statistics screens
were, to see values such as impressions, clicks, and CTR (Click-through rates) for a certain
period of time. After this, we have exported the statistics of a banner to Excel for making a
simple analysis chart. Finally, we learned that it was possible to jump into website and zone
statistics for any advertiser, campaign, or banner.
Have a go hero – exploring other statistics screens
As we already know how to get statistics for advertisers and campaigns, we are ready to
further explore websites and zones and global history statistics. Let's find and investigate
these sections under statistics menu until we learn what kind of additional statistics we can
get from the OpenX Ad Server system.

Using Reports and Statistics
[ 262 ]
OpenX advanced reports
Advanced reports section provides a more organized and easier way to analyze OpenX
statistics to work further with MS Excel. There are three types of advanced analysis reports:

Advertising analysis report: This report provides a breakdown of advertising
statistics for a particular advertiser or publisher. The generated report has three
sections—daily, campaign, and zone breakdowns.

Campaign analysis report: This report type is suitable to analyze the details of a
particular campaign. There are three breakdowns including day, banner, and zone. 

Campaign delivery report: This advanced report shows the delivery
statistics of campaigns for a certain selected period. It also highlights the 
underperforming campaigns.

What just happened?
We learned how to generate an advertising analysis report in a few steps. This helps us get
very useful statistics to determine the daily progress, success rates of campaigns, and zones
that are organized in separate Excel tabs for easy analysis.

Now, go and examine other report types including campaign analysis report and campaign
delivery report. Try to understand the differences between the report types.

Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how to use reports and online statistics to evaluate the
performance of OpenX advertisers, campaigns, banners, websites, and zones.
We have specifically covered:

Advertisers and campaigns statistics

Exporting data to Excel for further analysis

Types of advanced OpenX reports

Getting advertising analysis reports in Excel
We have finished OpenX Ad Server Beginner's Guide. By completing this book, you should
now have a strong foundation of how the online advertising business works and how you
can achieve highly-qualified scalable advertising, serving implementations using OpenX
Ad Server. Rereading the chapters that cover areas in which you have less experience 
and applying the examples in real world situations is a good idea. Do not be afraid of
experimenting with new ideas either!


Pop Quiz Answers
Chapter 1
understanding system requirements
1 
OpenX 2.8.3 requires 128 MB root memory_limit both for
installation and operation. So, the correct answer is (b). No
2 
OpenX operates on a LAMP environment which is correctly stated in
answer (c). Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
Chapter 2
understanding the basics
a 
This is true as zones are placeholders on our web pages and we need
to declare these zones by adding zone activation codes.
b 
This is false as an image banner size and a zone size have to match
each other. Otherwise, we will not be able to link them.

Pop Quiz Answers
[ 270 ]
Chapter 3
understanding different campaign types
1 
True. We should have at least one campaign for active zones so that
a blank space is not shown. The correct answer is (a)
2 
( b) as only a remnant campaign targets to this zone.
3
 (b) as Contract (Exclusive) campaigns take all the impressions 
for a targeted zone. a is false as each campaign type is prioritized
according to its weight or priority setting in comparison to its own
group.
Chapter 4
understanding different banner types
1 
(b) Using SQL Banner Type is not a good idea as the images will be stored in
our database and served from our very limited webhosting in terms of space
and bandwidth. It is the same for the local web server type as well. Surely, we
don’t want to reject the advertiser and lose money. There are many cheap
affordable image hosting solutions around with very high bandwidth options.
Using one of them will solve our problems of bandwidth and space. They can
be useful for image management as well.
Chapter 5
understanding banner zone linking
1 
All statements are true except e. as banner and zone sizes have to match
to achieve linking.

Appendix
[ 271 ]
understanding dynamic zone sizes
1 
We can show all types of banners except text link on a banner type zone.
Text link only can be shown on a text type zone. It eliminates the option 
d. b is also not valid as the height is 125 pixels. a and c options have the
same height size with the zone and can be shown there even though they
have different width values. So, the correct answer is (a) and (c)
Chapter 6
understanding channels
a 
It is true. Zone invocation code can hold only one Site – Source
parameter.
b 
It is true. A banner can use any number of channels at the same
time. It enables banners to be connected to multiple content targets.
For example, an mp3 player advertisement appearing on both an
electronics review zone and a music album reviews zone.
c 
No, it is false. Such usage is open to typing errors and hard to
manage if you later change Zone Invocation codes, thus Site – Source
parameter of the zones.
d 
No, it is false. Channels can also hold any number of other delivery
limitations. So, it is possible to have two targeted MP3 player zones,
which are further channelled by Geotargeting and separately showing
ads to US and non-US visitors.

Chapter 7
understanding OpenX account management
a 
It is a false statement. There are four types of accounts including
administrator, manager, advertiser, and website.
b 
It is true. All items under a manager account are deleted when this
manager account is deleted. Thus, we should be very careful when
playing with manager account settings.
c 
No, it is false. The manager account will be still available
under administrator account with all sub items of the manager
account. Later, we can create a user to log in to this manager
account. So, we can disallow access to any manager account
without actually deleting the account by just deleting the user.
d 
Yes, it is true. We can connect a certain user to as many types
of accounts we need.
Chapter 8
understanding user and account preferences
a 
True. This way, we guarantee that visitors will never see a blank
space when defined campaign banners are not being delivered due
to limitations; it doesn't matter what the account, campaign, banner,
website, or zone is.
b 
True. It makes OpenX an excellent tool to deliver ads according to
locally defined times on multiple user environments.
c 
True. Manager accounts can provide advertiser and website users
such functionality to audit their own changes only.

Appendix
[ 273 ]
Chapter 9
understanding upgrading OpenX process
1 
No, as the zone invocation codes still have the old paths in HTML files
on which they run, we always need to rename the new OpenX folder
accordingly. This is essential.
Chapter 10
understanding OpenX reports and statistics
1 
Because the users of an  advertiser account can only manage their own
campaigns, they don’t have access to the reports of all advertisers. So,
advertiser analysis report is closed for them. Campaign delivery report
is exclusively open for the administrator-or manager-account users. So,
the correct answer is (b). An advertiser-account user can only see his or
her campaign analysis report.
