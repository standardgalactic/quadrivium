About the Author
Geraldine Woods began her education when teachers still supplied ink wells to their stu-
dents. She credits her 35-year career as an English teacher to a set of ultra-strict nuns armed
with thick grammar books. She lives in New York City, where with great difficulty she refrains
from correcting signs containing messages such as “Bagel’s for sale.” She is the author of
more than 40 books, including English Grammar For Dummies, Research Papers For Dummies,
College Admission Essays For Dummies, and The SAT I Reasoning Test For Dummies.


Dedication
For the students who labor (and occasionally smile) in the grammar portion of my English
classes.

English Grammar Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
G
ood grammar pays. No, I’m not making a sentimental statement about the importance 
of a job well done or the satisfaction of learning for learning’s sake, though I believe in
both of those values. I’m talking about cold, hard cash, the kind you fold and put into your
wallet. Don’t believe me? Fine. Try this little test: The next time you go to the movies, tear
yourself away from the story for a moment and concentrate on the dialogue. Chances are
the characters who have fancy jobs or piles of dough sound different from those who don’t.
I’m not making a value judgment here; I’m just describing reality. Proper English, either writ-
ten or spoken, tends to be associated with the upper social or economic classes. Tuning up
your grammar muscles doesn’t guarantee your entry into the Bill Gates income tax bracket,
but poor grammar may make it much harder to fight your way in.
Another payoff of good grammar is better grades and an edge in college admissions. Teachers
have always looked more favorably on nicely written sentences, and grammar has recently
become an additional hurdle that applicants must jump over or stumble through when they
sit for the SAT or the ACT, the two most important standardized tests for the college bound.
The good news is that you don’t have to spend a lifetime improving your English. Ten min-
utes here, ten minutes there, and before you know it, your grammar muscles will be toned
to fighting strength. This book is the equivalent of a health-club membership for your writ-
ing and speaking skills. Like a good health club, it doesn’t waste your time with lectures on
the physiology of flat abs. Instead, it sends you right to the mat and sets you up with the
exercises that actually do the job.
About This Book
English Grammar Workbook For Dummies doesn’t concentrate on what we English teachers
(yes, I confess I am one) call descriptive grammar — the kind where you circle all the nouns
and draw little triangles around the prepositions. A closely guarded English-teacher secret is
that you don’t need to know any of that terminology (well, hardly any) to master grammar.
Instead, English Grammar Workbook For Dummies concentrates on functional grammar — what
goes where in real-life speech and writing.
Each chapter begins with a quick explanation of the rules (don’t smoke, don’t stick your
chewing gum on the bedpost, be sure your sentence is complete, and so forth). Okay, I’m
kidding about the smoking and the chewing gum, but you get the idea. I start off telling you
what’s right and wrong in standard English usage. Next, I provide an example and then hit
you with ten or so quick questions. Just to make sure you know that I’m not wasting your
time, in every chapter I give you a sample from real-life English (with a fairly absurd situa-
tion, just to keep your funny bone tingling), so you can see how proper grammar actually
aids communication.
After filling in the blanks, you can check your answers at the end of the chapter. In English
Grammar Workbook For Dummies, I also tell you why a particular choice is correct, not just
for the sake of learning a set of rules but rather to help you make the right decision the next
time — when you’re deciding between their and they’re or went and had gone, for example.

As the author of English Grammar For Dummies (Wiley) and a grammar teacher for more
decades than I care to count (let’s just say that I had an inkwell in my first classroom), I
believe that if you truly get the logic of grammar — and most rules do rest upon a logical
basis — you’ll be a better, more precise communicator.
English Grammar Workbook For Dummies offers a special welcome to readers for whom
English is a second language. You’ve probably picked up quite a bit of vocabulary and 
basic grammar already. English Grammar Workbook For Dummies lets you practice the little 
things — the best word choice for a particular sentence, the proper way to create a plural,
and so forth. This book moves you beyond comprehension to mastery.
Finally, because standardized college entrance exams are now a permanent part of the land-
scape, I’ve taken special care to provide examples that mirror those horrible tests. If you’re
facing the SAT or the ACT in the near future, don’t despair. Everything the grammar-testing
gurus expect you to know is in this book.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make your practice as easy as possible, I’ve used some conventions throughout this
book so that from chapter to chapter or section to section you’re not wondering what the
heck is going on. Here are a few to note:
 At the end of each chapter is the “Answers” section, which covers all the exercises in
that chapter. You can find the answers by thumbing through the book until you come
to the pages with the gray trim on the outside edge. 
 The last exercise in each chapter is comprehensive, so you can check your mastery of
the material in that chapter and sharpen your editing skills. You can find the compre-
hensive answers and explanations in the “Answers” section. The callout numbers
pointing to the corrections in the exercise correspond with the numbered explanations
in the text. I also provide an appendix devoted entirely to providing comprehensive
practice with the grammar skills you develop as you consult English Grammar For
Dummies and as you complete the exercises throughout this workbook.
What You’re Not to Read
I promise you that I’ve kept the grammar jargon to a minimum in this workbook, but I must
admit that I have included a couple of terms from schoolbook land. If you stumble upon a
definition, run away as fast as you can and try the sample question instead. If you can get
the point without learning the grammatical term, you win a gold star. Likewise, feel free to
skip the explanation of any question that you get right, unless of course you want to gloat.
In that case read the explanation while crowing, “I knew that.”
Foolish Assumptions
In writing the English Grammar Workbook For Dummies, I’m assuming that you fall into one
or more of these categories:
 You know some English but want to improve your skills.
 You aspire to a better job.
2
English Grammar Workbook For Dummies 

 You want higher grades or SAT/ACT scores.
 You feel a bit insecure about your language skills and want to communicate with more
confidence.
 You’re still learning to speak and write English fluently.
I’ve made two more global assumptions about you, the reader. First, you have a busy life with
very little time to waste on unnecessary frills. With this important fact in mind, I’ve tried to
keep the explanations in this book clear, simple, and short, so you can get right to it and prac-
tice away. I’ve left the fancy grammar terms — gerunds, indicative mood, copulative verb, and
the like — by the wayside, where, in my humble opinion, they belong. I don’t want to clutter
up your brain; I just want to give you what you need to know to speak and write in standard
English. For the total, complete, and occasionally humorous explanations, pick up a copy of
the companion book, English Grammar For Dummies, also written by yours truly (and pub-
lished by Wiley).
Second, I assume that you hate boring, schoolbook style. You’d prefer not to yawn as you
read. No problem! I too glaze over when faced with sentences like “The administrative coun-
cil approved the new water-purification project outlined in by-law 78-451 by a margin of
three votes to two.” To keep you awake, I’ve used my somewhat insane imagination to
create amusing sentences that will (I hope) make you smile or even laugh from time to time.
How This Book Is Organized
Life gets harder as you go along, doesn’t it? So too English Grammar Workbook For Dummies.
Parts I and II concentrate on the basics — plopping the right verbs into each sentence, form-
ing singulars and plurals, creating complete sentences, and so on. Part III moves up a notch to
the pickier stuff, not exactly world record but definitely the state-champ level. In Parts III and
IV, you get to try your hand at the most annoying problems presented by pronouns (those
pesky little words such as I, me, theirs, whomever, and others), advanced verb problems, and
comparisons (different than? different from? find out here!). Part V is totally practical, polishing
up your writing style and explaining some common word traps into which you may fall. Now
for more detail.
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: 
Grammar Basics
In this part I take you through the basic building blocks — verbs (words that express action or
state of being) and subjects (who or what you’re talking about) — with a quick side trip into
pronouns (I, he, her, and the like). I show you how to create a complete sentence. In this part
you practice choosing the correct verb tense in straightforward sentences and find out all you
need to know about singular and plural forms.
Part II: Mastering Mechanics
This part’s devoted to two little things — punctuation and capital letters — that can make
or break your writing. If you’re not sure whether to head North or north or if you want to
know where a comma belongs, this part’s for you.
3
Introduction

Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct 
Verb and Pronoun Use
Paging who and whom, not to mention I and me. This part tackles all the fun stuff associated
with pronouns, including the reason why (for all practical intents and purposes) everyone
can’t eat their lunch. Part III also solves your time problems, making you decipher the
shades of difference in verb tense (wrote? had written?) and voice (not alto or soprano, but
active or passive).
Part IV: All You Need to Know about 
Descriptions and Comparisons
Part IV doesn’t tackle which stock is a bad investment (and which is even worse), but it
puts you through your paces in selecting the best descriptive words (good? well?). Part IV
also weeds out illogical or vague comparisons.
Part V: Writing with Style
In Part V, the wind sprints and stretches are over, and it’s time to compete with world-class
writers. The toughest grammatical situations, plus exercises that address fluidity and vari-
ety, face you here. I also throw in some misunderstood words (healthful and healthy, to
name just two) and let you practice proper usage in this part.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Here you find ten ways that people trying to be super-correct end up being super-wrong and
ten errors that can kill your career (or grade).
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the cute little drawings that attract your gaze and alert you to key points, pitfalls,
and other groovy things. In English Grammar Workbook For Dummies, you find these three:
I live in New York City, and I often see tourists staggering around, desperate for a resident to
show them the ropes. The Tip icon is the equivalent of a resident whispering in your ear.
Psst! Want the inside story that will make your life easier? Here it is!
When you’re about to walk through a field riddled with land mines, it’s nice to have a map.
The Warning icon tells you where the traps are so you can delicately run like mad from them.
Theory doesn’t go very far when you’re working on grammar. You have to see the language
in action, so to speak. The Practice icon alerts you to (surprise!) an example and a set of
practice exercises so you can practice what I just finished preaching.

Where to Go from Here
To the refrigerator for a snack. Nope. Just kidding. Now that you know what’s where, turn to
the section that best meets your needs. If you’re not sure what would benefit you most, take
a moment to think about what bothers you. No, I’m not talking about the fact that your
favorite brand of yogurt just cut two ounces from each container. I’m talking about the parts
of writing or speaking that make you pause for a lengthy head scratch. Do you have trouble
picking the appropriate verb tense? Is finding the right word a snap but placing a comma
cause for concern? Do you go out of your way to avoid sentences with who because you
never know when to opt for whom?
After you’ve done a little grammatical reconnaissance, select the sections of this book that
meet your needs. Use the “How This Book Is Organized” section earlier in this introduction,
the table of contents, and the index to find more detail about what is where. Turn to the
exercises that address your issues and use the rest to line the birdcage. Of course, if you
decide to read every single word I’ve written, you win my “favorite person of the month”
award. But don’t beat yourself up if you pick and choose from the selection of tune-ups.
If you aren’t sure whether a particular topic is a problem, no problem! Run your eyeballs
over the explanation and sample question. Try a couple of sentences and check your
answers. If everything comes out okay and you understand the answers, move on. If you
stub your toe, go back and do a few more until the grammar rule becomes clear.
When you understand each concept separately but have trouble putting the whole picture
together, take a stab at the comprehensive exercise that ends each chapter. You have to find
and correct mistakes in a short piece of lunatic writing. After you find them, check yourself.
One more thing: Don’t try to do everything at once. Hit your mind with a half cup of gram-
mar (about ten minutes or so) at a time. More will stick, and as a huge plus, you’ll have time
to go bowling.

Laying Out the Concrete
Slab: Grammar Basics

In this part . . . 
I
f you’ve ever built a house — with real bricks or with
kiddy blocks — you know that the whole thing is likely
to fall down unless it’s sitting atop a strong foundation.
This part provides the stuff you need to lay the best foun-
dation for your writing. Chapter 1 takes you through
Verbology 101, explaining how to select the best verb for
present, past, and future situations. In the same chapter,
you find the most popular irregular verbs and everything
you need to know about the ever-helpful helping verb.
Chapter 2 sorts verbs into singular and plural piles and
helps you match each verb to the correct subject. Then
you’re ready to pair pronouns and nouns (Chapter 3) and
to distinguish complete from incomplete or too-long sen-
tences (Chapter 4). Ready? I promise I won’t let the roof
fall on your head!

Chapter 1
Placing the Proper Verb 
in the Proper Place
In This Chapter
 Examining past, present, and future tenses
 Practicing the perfect tenses
 Navigating among irregular forms
 Handling helping verbs
A
s short as two letters and as long as several words, verbs communicate action or state
of being. Plus, even without a new Rolex, they tell time. Unfortunately, that handy little
time-keeping function, like the buttons on my watch, can be confusing. In this chapter, I hit
you with basic time questions. No, not “You’re late again because . . . ?” but “Which verb 
do I need to show what’s completed, not yet begun, or going on right now?” The first sec-
tion hits the basic tenses (past, present, and future) and the second hits the perfect tenses,
which are anything but perfect. After that, you can work on irregulars and helping verbs.
Choosing among Past, Present, and Future
Verbs tell time with a quality known as tense. Before you reach for a tranquilizer, here’s the
lowdown on the basic tenses. You have three, and each has two forms — lo-carb and fat-
free. Sorry, I mean plain (called by its basic time designation — present, past, or future) and
progressive (the -ing form of a verb). Progressive places a little more emphasis on process or
on action that spans a time period, and the present progressive may reach into the future.
In many sentences, either plain or progressive verbs may be used interchangeably. Here’s a
taste of each:
 Past tense tells what happened either at a specific, previous time or describes a pat-
tern of behavior in the past. (In the sentence “Diane tattooed a skull on her bulging
bicep,” tattooed is a past tense verb. In “During the Motorcycle Festival, Diane was flex-
ing her bicep,” was flexing is a verb in past progressive tense.)
 Present tense tells you what’s going on now at the present moment, or more gener-
ally speaking, what action is recurring. It also touches the future. (In the sentence
“Grace rides her Harley,” rides is a present tense verb. In “Grace is always polishing her
Harley” and “Grace is riding to Florida,” the verbs is polishing and is riding are in pres-
ent progressive tense.)
 Future tense moves into fortune-teller land. (The verb in “Grace will give Diane a ride
around the block” is will give, which is in future tense. In “Grace will be bragging about
her new motorcycle for months,” will be bragging is in future progressive tense.)

Okay, time to check out a sample problem. The infinitive (the grandpappy of each
verb family) follows every sentence. Stay in that family when you fill in the blank,
choosing the correct tense. When you’re finished with this sample, try the practice
problems that follow.
Q. Yesterday, overreacting to an itty-bitty taste of arsenic, Mike _______________ his evil twin
brother of murder. (to accuse)
A. accused. The clue here is yesterday, which tells you that you’re in the past.
1. Fashion is important to David, so he always _______________ the latest and most popular
poaching style. (to select)
2. Last year’s tight, slim lines _______________ David, who, it must be admitted, does not
have a tiny waist. (to challenge)
3. While David _______________ new clothes, his fashion consultant is busy on the sidelines,
recommending stripes and understated plaids to minimize the bulge factor. (to buy)
4. David hopes that the next fashion fad _______________ a more mature, oval figure like his
own. (to flatter)
5. Right now Diane _______________ an article for the fashion press stating that so-tight-it-
may-as-well-be-painted-on leather is best. (to write)
6. She once _______________ a purple suede pantsuit, which clashed with her orange “I Love
Motorcycles” tattoo. (to purchase)
7. While she _______________ the pantsuit, two shoppers urged her to “go for it.” (to charge)
8. Two days after Diane’s shopping spree, Grace _______________ about show-offs who
“spend more time on their wardrobes than on their spark plugs.” (to mutter)
9. However, Diane knows that Grace, as soon as she raises enough cash, _______________ in
a suede outfit of her own. (to invest)
10. David, as always, _______________ in with the last word when he gave Grace and Diane the
“Fashion Train Wreck of the Year” award. (to chime)
11. Two minutes after she received the award, Diane _______________ it on a shelf next to her
“Best Dressed, Considering” medal. (to place)
12. Every day, when I see the medal, I _______________ what “considering” means. 
(to wonder)
13. Grace _______________ it to me in detail yesterday. (to explain)
14. “We earned the medal for considering many fashion options,” she _______________. 
(to state)
15. David, who _______________ Diane tomorrow, says that the medal acknowledges the fact
that Grace is “fashion-challenged” but tries hard anyway. (to visit)

Shining a Light on Not-So-Perfect Tenses
The perfect tenses tack has, have, or had onto a verb. Each perfect tense — present
perfect, past perfect, and future perfect — also has a progressive form, which includes
an -ing verb. The difference between plain perfect tense and progressive perfect is
subtle. The progressive perfect is a bit more immediate than the plain form and refers
to something that’s ongoing or takes places over a span of time. In many sentences
the plain and progressive forms may be interchanged. Here’s when to use the perfect
tenses:
 Present perfect links the past and the present. An action or state of being
began in the past and is still going on. (In the sentence “Despite numerous
reports of sightings around the world, Kristin has stayed close to home,” the
verb has stayed is in present perfect tense. In “Kristin has been living within two
miles of the Scottish border for the last decade,” has been living is a present per-
fect progressive tense verb.)
 Past perfect places one event in the past before another event in the past.
(The verb in “Mike had dumped his dirty laundry in his mother’s basement long
before she decided to change the front-door lock” is had dumped, which is in
past perfect tense. In the sentence “Christy, Mike’s mother, had been threatening
a laundry strike for years, but the beginning of mud-wrestling season pushed her
to the breaking point,” had been threatening is a past perfect progressive tense
verb.)
 Future perfect implies a deadline sometime (surprise, surprise) in the future.
(In the sentence “Before sundown, David will have toasted several dozen loaves
of bread,” will have toasted is in future perfect tense. The verb in “By the time
you turn on the television, Eye on Cooking will have been covering the toasting
session for two hours, with six more to go,” is will have been covering, which is in
future perfect progressive tense.)
Practice, especially with these verbs, makes perfect, so try this example and then
plunge ahead. The verb you’re working on appears as an infinitive (the basic, no-tense
form) at the end of the sentence. Change it into the correct tense and fill in the blank.
Q. Kristin _______________ an acceptance speech, but the “Spy of the Year” title went to
Hanna instead. (to prepare)
A. had prepared. With two events in the past, the had signals the prior event. The preparing
of the speech took place before the awarding of the title, so had prepared is the form you
want.
16. Mike _______________ on thin ice for two hours when he heard the first crack. (to skate)
17. Diane _______________ Mike for years about his skating habits, but he just won’t listen. 
(to warn)
18. David — a delicate, sensitive soul — accompanied Mike to the pond and then to the hos-
pital. After David _______________ an hour, the doctor announced that the skater was free
to go. (to wait)
19. After today’s skating trip ends, David _______________ a total of 1,232 hours for his friend
and _______________ countless outdated magazines in the emergency room family area.
(to wait, to read)
11
Chapter 1: Placing the Proper Verb in the Proper Place

20. Grace _______________ to speak to Mike ever since he declared that “a little thin ice”
shouldn’t scare anyone. (to refuse)
21. Mike, in a temper, pointed out that Grace’s motorcycle _______________ him to the 
hospital even more frequently than his skates. (to send)
22. In an effort to make peace, Kristin _______________ quietly to both combatants before
they ever stop yelling at each other. (to speak)
23. Despite years of practice, Tim _______________ success only on rare occasions, but he
keeps trying to resolve his brother’s conflicts anyway. (to achieve)
24. At times Tim’s conflict-resolution technique _______________ of violent finger pokes in the
fighters’ ribs, but he is trying to become more diplomatic. (to consist)
25. After Mike _______________ that his brother’s wisest course of action was to “butt out,”
Tim simply ignored him. (to declare)
26. We all think that Tim _______________ up on conflict resolution by the time Mike turns 30.
(to give)
27. Despite failing with Mike every time he tries to avoid a quarrel, Tim _______________ 
interest in a diplomatic career several times over the last few weeks. (to express)
28. Although Mike _______________ several ambassadors about his brother’s career plans
during his visit to the United Nations last week, no one granted Tim an interview yester-
day, though he spent the day begging for “just five minutes.” (to approach)
29. Kristin, the soul of kindness, said that before Tim makes his next career move, she
_______________ that “it’s hard to break into this field” at least five times. (to declare)
30. David could help, as he _______________ as an ambassador for the last seven years and
won’t retire until 2010. (to serve)
Navigating among Irregular Forms
Designed purposely to torture you, irregular verbs stray from the usual -ed form in
the past tense. The irregularity, which doesn’t entitle you to the sale price the way it
does for irregular sheets or other things that are actually useful, continues in a form
called the past participle. You don’t need to know the terms; you just need to know
what words replace the usual -ed verb configuration (sang and sung instead of singed,
for example).
You can’t memorize every possible irregular verb. If you’re unsure about a particular
verb, look it up in the dictionary. The definition will include the irregular form.
Here’s a set of irregular problems to pickle your brain. Fill in the blanks with the cor-
rect irregular form, working from the verb indicated in parentheses. Notice that the
parentheses don’t, strictly speaking, contain a verb at all — just the ancestor of that
particular verb family, the infinitive. Check out the following example.
12
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

Q. With one leg three inches shorter than the other, Natalie seldom _______________ into
second base, even when the team was desperate for a base hit. (to slide)
A. slid. No -ed for this past tense! Slid is the irregular past form of to slide.
31. If you discover a piece of pottery on the floor, look for Natalie, who has _______________
many vases because of her tendency to dust far too emotionally. (to break)
32. Once, Natalie _______________ with sadness at her first glimpse of a dusty armchair. 
(to shake)
33. David, no mean duster himself, _______________ a manual of daily furniture maintenance.
(to write)
34. The manual, entitled Dust or Die, _______________ to the top of the best-seller list. (to rise)
35. News reports indicated that nearly all the copies had been _______________ by fanatical
cleaners. (to buy)
36. David once dusted the fire alarm so forcefully that it went off; the firefighters weren’t
amused because David had _______________ the fire alarm a little too often. (to ring)
37. The fire chief promptly _______________ to speak with the mayor about David’s false
alarm. (to go)
38. The mayor has _______________ an investigation into a new category of offenses, “False
Dust Alarms”; almost immediately, David _______________ to protest. (to begin)
39. “I have _______________ to a new low,” sighed David, as he enrolled in the local chapter of
Clean Anonymous. “I hear that Natalie has _______________ a new hobby. Maybe I can
too.” (to sink, to find)
40. Natalie _______________ David to a fly-catching meet, and soon his interest in grime
_______________ the dust. (to take, to bite)
41. Natalie, however, became completely excited by fly catching and _______________ a 
tapestry with a delicate fly pattern. (to weave)
42. David, worried about Natalie’s enthusiasm for winged pests, _______________ help. 
(to seek)
43. “Leave the flies,” _______________ David. (to say)
44. “Never!” Natalie declared as she _______________ her coffee. (to drink)
45. David soon _______________ up on Natalie and her new hobby. (to give)
Mastering the Two Most Common 
Irregulars: Be and Have
Two irregular verbs, to be and to have, appear more frequently than a movie star with
a new film to promote. And like a movie star, they tend to cause trouble. Both change
according to time and according to the person with whom they’re paired. (Amazing
13

that the movie-star comparison works on so many levels!) Because they’re common,
you need to be sure to master all their forms, as Table 1-1 shows.

A. has been. Been is the combining form used with helping verbs, such as has.
46. If pickling _______________ necessary, I’ll bring my own vinegar.
47. Who ever _______________ enough cucumbers on this sort of occasion?
48. “Not me,” replied Mike. “I _______________ totally comfortable with the green vegetables
in my refrigerator.”
49. Kristin, never outdone, _______________ a different idea.
50. “Grace and I _______________ firmly in the anti-vegetable camp,” she commented.
51. By the time she finishes the meal, Kristin _______________ three trophies for carbo-
loading.
52. Diane _______________ Champion of the Potato Salad Competition for three years in a 
row, counting this year.
53. Grace _______________ second thoughts about her entry choice; she now thinks that she
should have picked sides instead of main dishes.

with the prizes this year.
55. Give me a taste because I _______________ a judge.

Getting By with a Little Help 
from Some Other Verbs
In addition to has, have, had, and the be verbs (am, is, are, was, were, and so on) you
can attach a few other helpers to a main verb, and in doing so, change the meaning of
the sentence slightly. Helpers you need to consider hiring include:
 Should and must add a sense of duty. Notice the sense of obligation in these
two sentences: “David should put the ice cream away before he eats the whole
thing.” “David must reduce his cholesterol, according to his doctor.”
 Can and could imply ability. By the way, could is the past tense of can. Choose
the tense that matches the tense of the main verb or the time period expressed
in the sentence, as in these examples, “If Hanna can help, she will.” or “Courtney
could stray from the beaten path, depending upon the weather.”
 May and might add possibility to the sentence. Strictly speaking, might is for
past events, and may for present, but these days people interchange the two
forms. So far the sky hasn’t fallen. Check out these examples: “I may go to the
picnic if I can find a bottle of ant-killer.” “I told Courtney that she might want to
bring some insect repellent.”
 Would usually expresses a condition or willingness. This helper explains under
what circumstances something may happen. (“I would have brought the mouse if
I had known about the cat problem.”) Would may also express willingness. (“He
would bait the trap. . . .”) Would sometimes communicates repeated past actions.
(“Every Saturday he would go to the pet store for more mouse food.”) The pres-
ent tense of would, the helping verb will, may also indicate a condition in the
present or future. (“I will go if I can find a free ticket.”)
Now take a crack at this example and following exercises. Add a helper to the main
verb. The information in parentheses after the fill-in-the-blank sentence explains what
meaning the sentence should have.
Q. Steve said that he _______________ consider running for Parks Commissioner, but he
hasn’t made his mind up yet. (possibility)
A. might or may. The might or may shows that Steve hasn’t ruled out a run.
56. Melissa, shy as ever, said that she _______________ go to the tree-cutting ceremony only if
the press agreed to stay outside the forest. (condition)
57. Kirk, beat reporter for the local radio station, _______________ not agree to any condi-
tions, because the station manager insisted on eyewitness coverage. (ability)
58. Lisa, on the other hand, explained that if barred from the event she _______________ rely
on an interview with Steve after the event. (possibility)
59. Lisa knows that Steve _______________ leap to fame based on the tree-cutting incident,
and she doesn’t want to miss an important scoop. (ability)
60. All good reporters _______________ know that if a tree falls in the forest, the sound is
heard by a wide audience only if a radio reporter is there. (duty)
15

61. Sound engineers, on the other hand, _______________ skip all outdoor events if they
_______________ do so. (condition, ability)
62. On-air talent always _______________ find a way to weather all hardships, including bad
weather. (ability)
63. Some media watchers believe that reporters _______________ be a bit more modest.
(duty)
64. In response, reporters claim that the public _______________ not appreciate humility if
they _______________ choose greater entertainment value. (condition, ability)
65. Steve _______________ have allowed the press at the scene had he known about the fuss.

Time to sharpen all the tools in your verb kit. Read the memo in Figure 1-1, a product
of my fevered brain, and correct all the verbs that have strayed from the proper path.
You should find ten.
To: All Employees
From: Christy
Subject: Paper Clips
It had come to my attention that some employees will be bending paper 
clips nearly every day. A few copy clerks even bended an entire box. 
Because of my duty as your supervisor, I would remind you that paper 
clips have been expensive. In my ten years of superior wisdom as your 
boss, I always gave you a fair deal. I will have given you a fair deal in the 
future also, but only if you showed some responsibility. Therefore, I will 
begin inspecting the desks in this office this morning. By quitting time, I 
will have been checking every single one. If your desk contains a bent 
paper clip, you would find yourself out of a job.

Answers to Problems on Verbs 
and Verb Tenses
a
selects. Notice the time clues? The first part of the sentence contains the word is, a present-
tense verb, and the second part includes the word always. Clearly you’re in the present with a
recurring action.
b
challenged. Another time clue: last year’s places you in the past.
c
is buying or buys. The second verb in the sentence (is) takes you right into the store with
David, watching the unfolding action. Present progressive tense gives a sense of immediacy, so
is buying makes sense. The plain present tense (buys) works nicely also.
d
will flatter. The key here is next, which puts the sentence in the future.
e
is writing. The time clue “right now” indicates an ongoing action, so the present progressive
form is writing works well here.
f
purchased. Diane’s bad taste splurge happened once, which means it took place in the past.
g
was charging or charged. The second part of the sentence includes the verb urged, which
places you in the past. I like the past progressive (was charging) here because the word while
takes you into the process of charging, which went on over a period of time. However, the sen-
tence makes sense even when the process isn’t emphasized, so charged is also an option.
h
muttered or was muttering. The clue to the past is two days after. The second answer gives
more of a “you are there” feel, but either is correct.
i
will invest. The time words here, as soon as, tell you that the action hasn’t happened yet.
j
chimed. If David gave, you’re in past tense.
k
placed. The first verb in the sentence (received) is in the past tense, so you know that the
action of placing the award on the shelf is also in past tense.
l
wonder. The time clue here is “every day,” which tells you that this action is still happening at
the present time and should be in present tense.
m
explained. The “yesterday” is a dead giveaway; go for past tense.
n
stated. The saga of Grace and Diane’s award is in past tense, and this sentence is no exception.
Even without the story context, you see the first verb (earned) is in past tense, which works
nicely with the past-tense verb stated.
o
will visit. The time clue is “tomorrow,” which places the verb in the future.
p
had been skating or had skated. You have two actions in the past — the skating and the hear-
ing. The two hours of skating came before the hearing, so you need past perfect tense. Either
the plain or the progressive form works here, so give yourself a gold star for either answer.
q
has been warning or has warned. The second half of the sentence indicates the present 
(won’t listen), but you also have a hint of the past (for years). Present perfect is the best choice
because it links past and present. I like the immediacy of progressive here (I can hear Diane’s
ranting), but plain present perfect also is okay.
17
Chapter 1: Placing the Proper Verb in the Proper Place

r
had waited or had been waiting. The waiting preceded the doctor’s announcement, so you
should use past perfect. Progressive adds a “you are there” feel (good if you’re a fan of hospital
waiting rooms) but isn’t necessary.
s
will have waited, will have read. The deadline in the sentence (the end of today’s trip) is your
clue for future perfect tense.
t
has refused. Notice the present-past link? Mike declared and Grace is acting now. Hence you
need present perfect tense.
u
had sent. The pointing and the hospital-sending are at two different times in the past, with the
hospital occurring first. Go for past perfect for the earlier action.
v
will have spoken. The future perfect needs an end point (in this sentence, the end of the
yelling) before which the action occurs.
w
has achieved. If he keeps trying, you have a present-tense idea that’s connected to the past
(despite years of practice and on rare occasions). Present perfect connects the present and past.
x
has consisted. This sentence has a present-tense clue (at times). The sentence tells you about
the past (at times) and the present (is trying), so present perfect is the one you want.
y
had declared. The after at the beginning of the sentence is your clue that one action occurs
before another. Because both are in the past, you need past perfect tense for the earlier action.
A
will have given. A deadline at some point in the future calls for future perfect tense.
B
has expressed. The sentence ties the present to the past, as you see in the time clues failing
(which implies present) and over the last few weeks (which implies past). The present perfect
tense is perfect for present-past links. (Sorry for the pun.)
C
had approached. The sentence discusses two actions in the past. Mike’s action — an approach to
ambassadors — took place before Tim’s action — begging for “a few minutes of your time.” You
express the earlier of two past actions with the past perfect tense.
D
will have declared. A future deadline (before Tim makes his next career move) requires future
perfect tense.
E
has served. The sentence tells you that David was and still is the ambassador. To link past and
present, go for present perfect tense.
F
broken. The verb to break has two irregular forms, broke and broken.
G
shook. To shake has two irregular forms, shook and shaken.
H
wrote. For correct writing, use wrote, which is the past tense of the verb to write.
I
rose. You’ve probably heard that “a rose is a rose by any other name.” Be sure to rise to the
occasion and choose rose or risen, not rised.
J
bought. Let this verb remind you of other irregulars, including caught, taught, and thought.
Here’s a line to help you remember: I thought I was in trouble because I caught a cold when I
taught that class of sneezing 10-year-olds, but fortunately I had bought a dozen handkerchiefs
and was well prepared.
K
rung. The bell rings, rang, or has/have/had rung.
18

19
Chapter 1: Placing the Proper Verb in the Proper Place
L
went. Take a memo: I go, I went, and I have or had gone.
M
begun, began. The plain past tense form is began, and the form that combines with has, have,
or had is begun.
N
sunk, found. To sink becomes sank in the past tense and has or have sunk in the perfect tenses.
To find becomes found in both past and present/past perfect.
O
took, bit. These two forms are in simple past; the perfect forms use taken and bitten.
P
wove. The past tense of to weave is wove.
Q
sought. This irregular form wandered far from the original. The past tense of to seek is sought.
R
said. This irregular verb is the past tense of to say.
S
drank. Three forms of this verb sound like a song to accompany a beer blast: drink, drank, and
drunk. The middle form, which is past tense, is the one you want here. The form that combines
with has and have (in case you ever need it) is drunk.
T
gave. The verb to give turns into gave in the past tense.
U
is. Here you’re in present tense.
V
has. You need a singular, present verb to match who in this sentence.
W
am. The verb to be changes to am when it’s paired with I.
X
has or had. This answer depends on the tense. If you’re speaking about a past event, choose
had, but if you’re speaking about something in the here and now, has is your best bet.
Y
are. You need a plural to match Grace and I.
z
will have. The sentence speaks about the future.
Z
has been. The sentence requires a link between past and present, so simple past won’t do. You
need present perfect, the bridge between those two time periods. Has been does the job.
1
had. The sentence calls for a contrast with now, so opt for past tense.
2
will be. Once more into the future!
3
am or will be. You may choose either present or future, depending upon the context.
4
would. The going is dependent upon the press arrangement. Thus would is the best choice.
5
could. The agreement wasn’t possible, and the whole thing is in past tense, so could wins the
prize.
6
may or might. Lisa, if she’s in the mood, will cover the tree-cutting without seeing it. This possi-
bility is expressed by the helpers may or might.
7
can. You need to express ability in the present tense, which can can do.
8
should. Gotta get that duty in, and should does the job.

9
would, could or will, can. If you’re speaking in past tense, go for the first answer pair. The
second set takes you into the present. Don’t mix and match! If you’re in one time period, don’t
switch without a good reason to do so.
0
can. Now you’re firmly in present tense (clue word = always) and can adds a sense of ability.
!
should. When duty calls, opt for should.
@
would, could or will, can. The public’s appreciation is conditional, and would expresses that
fact. The second half of the sentence talks about ability, using could. The would/could pair is
best for past tense, and will/can does the job for present. Be sure to stay only in one tense. No
mixing allowed.
#
would. The first part of the sentence talks about a condition that is not actually happening, and
would fills the bill.
$
Had come is wrong because it places one action in the past before another action in the past —
not the meaning expressed by this sentence. Instead, sentence one needs a verb to link past
and present, and has come fills the bill.
%
Will be places the action in the future, but the memo once again seeks to establish that the
bending went on in the past and continues in the present, so present perfect tense (have been
bending) does the job.
^
Bent is an irregular past form. Bended is never correct in standard English.
&
Because you’re talking about duty, should works nicely here. You may also select am reminding
because the boss is in the process of reminding the employees of paper clip prices.
To:  All Employees

Subject: Paper Clips
It had has come to my attention that some employees will be have

would  should remind you that paper clips have been are expensive.  In 
my ten years of superior wisdom as your boss, I always gave have

*
Present tense is better because the boss is concerned about current expenses.
(
The boss is bragging about fairness in the past, which continues in the present. Thus present
perfect tense (have given) is best. Note: The always may be placed between the two words of
the verb (have always given) if you wish.
)
Will give is correct; will have given implies a deadline.
-
The boss is talking about the present and future, not the past, so showed is inappropriate. Go
with the present tense form, show.
_
No need for progressive here, because the boss wants to tell the underlings when the investiga-
tion will end, not when it will be going on.
=
You’re expressing a real possibility here, so will or may works well. The helper will is more defi-
nite. May leaves a little wiggle room.

Pairing Subjects and Verbs Correctly
In This Chapter
 Forming plural nouns
 Pairing subject and verb forms in common sentences
 Dealing with difficult subjects
I
n Grammarworld, which is located somewhere under the ground that normal people
walk on, the difference between singular (the one, the only, the solitary) and plural (any-
where from two to a crowd) is a big deal. In this respect, grammar follows real life. When the
obstetrician reports on the ultrasound or your date lists ex-spouses, the difference between
one and more than one is a matter of considerable interest.
In this chapter I show you how to tell the difference between singular and plural nouns, pro-
nouns, and verbs, and I get you started on pairing them up correctly in some common sen-
tence patterns. I also help you tackle difficult subjects such as everyone, somebody, and
either and neither.
When One Just Isn’t Enough: Plural Nouns
When I was in elementary school, the only spell-check was the teacher’s very long, very
sturdy, and very often employed ruler. “Don’t you know you’re supposed to change the y to i
and add es?” Miss Hammerhead would inquire just before the ruler landed (Bam!) on a pupil’s
head. Hammerhead (not her real name, or was it?) was teaching spelling, but she also was
explaining how to form the plural of some nouns, the grammatical term for words that name
people, places, things, or ideas. Here are Miss Hammerhead’s lessons, minus the weaponry:
 Regular plurals pick up an s (one snob/two snobs and a dollar/two billion dollars).
 Nouns ending in s, sh, ch, and x tack on es to form the plural (kindness/kindnesses,
splash/splashes, catch/catches, and hex/hexes), unless the noun has an irregular
plural. I tell you more about irregular plurals in a minute.
 Nouns ending in ay, ey, oy, uy — in other words, a vowel before y — simply add 
an s (monkey/monkeys and boy/boys).
 Nouns ending in y preceded by a consonant change the y to i and add es
(butterfly/butterflies and mystery/mysteries).
 Irregular nouns cancel all bets: anything goes! Sometimes the noun doesn’t change at
all, so the plural and singular forms are exactly the same (fish/fish deer/deer); other
times the noun does change (leaf/leaves and child/children). When you’re unsure
about an irregular plural, you can check the dictionary. The definition lists the plural
form for each noun.

When making the plural of a proper name — say, Smith — just add s. Don’t change
any letters even if the name ends with a consonant-y combo (Smithy, perhaps). Just
add s for the Smiths and the Smithys.
Are you up for some multiplication? At the end of each sentence is a noun in paren-
theses. Write the plural in the blank, as in this example:
Q. Jennifer remained doubtful about the existence of flying dinner _______________. (plate)
A. plates. Love those regular plurals! Just add s.
1. Jennifer’s previous arguments have been so dramatic that her friends have frequently
inquired about committing her to any of several local mental health _______________.
(clinic)
2. Jennifer, with her usual wit, refers to these establishments as _______________. (nuthouse)
3. The town eccentric, Jennifer has several _______________ of light green hair, courtesy of a
bottle of dye. (thatch)
4. Jennifer sees her unusual hair color as a weapon in the battle of the _______________. (sex)
5. Few people know that Jennifer, an accomplished historian and mathematician, has 
created a series of _______________ on the Hundred Years’ War. (graph)
6. Jennifer also knows a great deal about the role of _______________ in colonial America.
(turkey)
7. She discovered that the average colony had four turkeys — a guy who never paid his bills,
an idiot who thought “Come here often?” was a good pickup line, and two _______________
who plucked out their _______________ to protect against witchcraft. (woman, lash)
8. The _______________ of envy at Jennifer’s scholarship were quite loud. (sigh)
9. A couple of professors, however, think that Jennifer’s _______________ are filled with bats.
(belfry)
10. Perhaps they’re right, because Jennifer has encountered quite a bit of wildlife in her bell
towers, including _______________, _______________, and _______________. (deer, squirrel,
goose)
Isn’t Love Groovy? Pairing 
Subjects and Verbs
To make a good match, as every computer-dating service knows, you have to pair like
with like. In Grammarworld, you have to link singular subjects with singular verbs
and plural subjects with plural verbs. The good news is that most of the time English
verbs have only one form for both singular and plural. “I smirk” and “the dinosaurs
smirk” are both correct, even though I is singular and dinosaurs is plural. You have to
worry only in these few special circumstances:
24
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

 Talking about someone in the present tense requires different verb forms for
singular and plural. The singular verb ends in s, a strange reversal of the regular
nouns, where the addition of s creates a plural. (“He spits” and “They spit.” Spits
is singular; spit is plural.)
 Verbs that include does/do or has/have change forms for singular and plural.
With one important exception (that I explain in a minute), singular verbs use
does or has. (“Does John paint his toenails blue?” Does paint is a singular verb.
“John has stated that his toenails are naturally blue.” The verb has stated is sin-
gular.) Now for the exception: I (the one, the only, always singular pronoun) pairs
with do and have. Why? I have no idea. Just to make your life more difficult,
probably.
 The verb to be changes form according to the noun or pronoun paired with it.
The singular verb forms and some matching pronouns include I am, you are,
he/she/it is, we/they are, I was, you were, he/she/it was, we/they were.
 Two subjects joined by and make a plural and take a plural verb. As you dis-
covered in kindergarten, one plus one equals two, which is a plural. (“Kristin and
David plan a bank job every two years.” Kristin and David forms a plural subject,
and plan is a plural verb.)
 Two singular subjects joined by or take a singular verb. The logic here is that
you’re saying one or the other, but not both, so two singles joined by or don’t
add up to a double. (“David or his friendly branch manager is cooking the books
to cover the theft.” David is a singular subject, and so is manager, and each is
matched with the singular verb is cooking.)
 Ignore interrupters when matching subjects to verbs. Interrupters include
phrases such as “of the books” and “except for . . .” and longer expressions such
as “as well as . . .” and “which takes the cake.” Some interrupters (as well as, in
addition to) appear to create a plural, but grammatically they aren’t part of the
subject and, like all interrupters, have no effect on the singular/plural issue.
(“Kristin, as well as all her penguins, is marching to the iceberg today.” The sub-
ject, Kristin, is singular and matched with the singular verb is.)
 Here and there can’t be subjects. It’s in their contract. In a here or there sen-
tence, look for the subject after the verb. (“Here are five pink beans.” In this sen-
tence, beans is a plural subject, and are is a plural verb.)
 The subject usually precedes the verb but may appear elsewhere. (“Around
the corner speed Kristin and David, heading for the getaway car.” Kristin and
David form a plural subject, which is matched with speed, a plural verb.)
Test yourself with this example. In the blank, write the correct form of the verb in
parentheses.
Q. John’s podiatrist _______________ interested in the toenail-color issue. (remain/remains)
A. remains. The subject is singular (John has only one foot doctor!) so the verb must also
be singular. The letter s creates a singular verb.
11. Hinting delicately that blue _______________ not a natural color for nails, Nadine
_______________ her toes in distress. (is/are, wriggle/wriggles)
12. John, whose hair _______________ been every color of the rainbow, says that he
_______________ from a toe condition. (has/have, suffer/suffers)
13. We _______________ not buying his story. (am/is/are)
25
Chapter 2: Matchmaker, Make Me a Match: Pairing Subjects and Verbs Correctly

14. You probably _______________ John because you _______________ everyone the benefit of
the doubt. (believe/believes, give/gives)
15. _______________ you think that John’s friends always _______________ the truth?
(Does/Do, tell/tells)
16. _______________ his story fallen on disbelieving ears? (Has/Have)
17. No one ever _______________ when John _______________ avoiding reality. (know/knows,
am/is/are)
18. He _______________ sometimes created very convincing tales. (has/have)
19. Why _______________ everyone believe him? (does/do)
20. I _______________ completely dismayed by John’s dishonest tendencies. (was/were)
21. There _______________ six security guards in the safety deposit area. (was/were)
22. David, as well as such a well-known criminal mastermind as Alissa, _______________ easily
caught. (was/were)
23. His arrest on a variety of charges _______________ being processed as we speak. (is/are)
24. There _______________ a movie director and a literary agent in the crowd trying to gain
access to David. (was/were)

autobiography and a reality television show. (includes/include)
26. Imagine the show: Formally dressed as always, across the screen _______________ David
and Kristin. (waddles/waddle)
27. The producer of the series _______________ guaranteed a hit. (has/have)
28. Kristin or Carrie, driven by a desire for fame and stretch limos, _______________ sure to
be interested in the deal. (is/are)

Taming the Brats: Difficult Subjects 
to Match with Verbs
Like a child who has missed a nap, some subjects delight in being difficult. Difficult
though they may be, most, all, either, each, and other brats will, with a bit of attention,
quickly turn into well-behaved subjects. Here are the rules:
 Pronouns ending in -one, -thing, and -body (everyone, something, and anybody,
for example) are singular, even though they sometimes sound plural. (“Everyone
is here.” Singular subject everyone must be matched with the singular verb is.)
26
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

 All, some, most, none, and any can be either singular or plural. Subjects that
can be counted are plural. (“All the ears that stick out are going to be super-glued
to the scalp.” The subject all is plural, because you can count ears.) A subject that
is measured but not counted is singular. (“Most of my hatred for broccoli stems
from an attack by a renegade vegetable salesman.” The subject most is singular
because hatred, at least metaphorically, can be measured but not counted.)
 Either and neither alone, without or and nor, are singular. (“Neither of my
uncles has agreed to take me to the movies this afternoon.” The singular subject
neither matches the singular verb has.)
 In either/or and neither/nor sentences, match the verb to the closest subject.
(“Either Josh or his partners are going to jail.” The verb in this sentence, are
going, is closer to partners than to Josh. Because partners is plural, you need a
plural verb. If the sentence were reversed, the verb would be singular: “Either his
partners or Josh is going to jail.”)
 Each and every are always singular, no matter what they precede. (“Each of
the five thousand computers that Elizabeth bought was on sale.” “Every com-
puter and printer in the office has been certified ‘stolen’ by the FBI.” In these
sentences the addition of each and every creates a singular subject that must be
paired with a singular verb.)
Ready to relax? I don’t think so. Try these problems. Underline the correct verb from
each pair.
Q. Neither the fire marshal nor the police officers (was/were) aware of the bowling 
tournament.
A. were. Did you use a ruler? The subject police officers is closer to the verb than marshal.
Because police officers is plural, the verb must also be plural.
31. All the dancers in Lola’s musical (is/are) required to get butterfly tattoos.
32. Either of the principal singers (has/have) enough talent to carry the musical.
33. Every orchestra seat and balcony box (is/are) sold already.
34. Why (does/do) no one understand that Lola’s musical is extremely boring?
35. Most of the songs (has/have) been written already, but the out-of-town tryouts suggest
that more work is needed.
36. Everyone (has/have) invested a substantial amount in Whatever Lola Wants, but no one
(is/are) expecting a profit, despite the strong ticket sales.
37. Neither her partners nor Lola (is/are) willing to speculate on the critical reception.
38. Any of the reviews (has/have) the ability to make or break the production.
39. (Has/Have) either the director or the musicians agreed on a contract?
40. Everyone (agrees/agree) that Lola should cut the fifth song, “Why I Tattoo.”
41. Lola is much more interested in tattoos than most of the members of the audience
(is/are).
27
Chapter 2: Matchmaker, Make Me a Match: Pairing Subjects and Verbs Correctly

42. I don’t understand the tattoo fixation because neither of Lola’s parents (has/have) any 
tattoos.
43. Perhaps every one of Lola’s 20 tattoos (is/are) a form of rebellion.
44. Some of the tattoos, of course, (is/are) to be covered by makeup, because Lola’s charac-
ter is an innocent schoolgirl.
45. However, each of the tattoos (has/have) special meaning to Lola, and she is reluctant to
conceal anything.
46. “Truth,” she says, “is important. All the fame in the world (is/are) not as valuable as 
honesty.”
47. Lola talks a good line, but all her accountants (believes/believe) that she will go along
with the necessary cover-up.
48. (Has/Have) someone mentioned the Tony Awards to Lola?
49. Either Lola or her producers (is/are) sure to win at least one award — if nobody else
(enters/enter) the contest.
50. Every Tony and Oscar on Lola’s shelf (is/are) a testament to her talent.
51. Neither of her Tony awards, however, (has/have) been polished for a long time.
52. Perhaps someone (has/have) neglected to hire a cleaning professional to spruce up 
Lola’s house. 
53. Both of Lola’s brothers (is/are) in the field of furniture maintenance. 
54. (Was/Were) either of her brothers called in to consult about trophy cleaning?
55. If so, perhaps either Lola’s brothers or Lola herself (is/are) on the verge of a cleaner
future.
56. Most of us, I should point out, (believe/believes) that Lola will never forget to shine her
Oscar statuettes.
57. In fact, some of the Oscars that Lola has won (sparkles/sparkle) blindingly.
58. All of the Oscar-night attention (is/are) very appealing to Lola, who doesn’t even attend
the Tony ceremony, even when she’s nominated.
59. Because neither Tom Cruise nor his costars (attends/attend) the Tony ceremony, Lola
makes a point of being “on location” when the big night rolls around.
60. Each of the last fifteen Oscar nights, however, (is/are) an almost sacred obligation, in
Lola’s view.

Answers to Subject and Verb 
Pairing Problems
a
clinics. For a regular plural, just add s.
b
nuthouses. Regular plural here: Add an s.
c
thatches. For a noun ending in ch, add es.
d
sexes. To a noun ending in x, add es to form a plural.
e
graphs. Did I fool you? The h at the end of the noun doesn’t, all by itself, call for es. Only words
ending in sh or ch require an added es in the plural form. For graph, a plain s will do.
f
turkeys. For nouns ending in ay, ey, and oy, add s to form a plural.
g
women, lashes. The plural of woman is irregular. The second noun ends in sh, so you must tack
on es for a plural.
h
sighs. Regular plurals are fun; just add s.
i
belfries. The plural of a noun ending in consonant-y is created by dropping the y and adding ies.
j
deer, squirrels, geese. The first and third nouns form irregular plurals, but good old squirrels
follows the rule in which you simply add s to the singular.
k
is, wriggles. You need two singular forms here: blue is and Nadine wriggles.
l
has, suffers. The verbs has and suffers are singular, as they should be, because the subject-verb
pairs are hair has and he suffers.
m
are. The plural verb are matches the plural subject we.
n
believe, give. The pronoun you always takes a plural verb such as believe and give.
o
Do, tell. Both verbs are plural, matching the plural subjects you and friends. In the first pair, the
subject is tucked between the two parts of the verb because the sentence is a question.
p
Has. You need a singular form here to pair with the singular subject his story.
q
knows, is. Both answers are singular and match the singular subjects no one and John.
r
has. Because he is singular, the verb has must also be singular.
s
does. The pronoun everyone is singular, so it matches the singular form does.
t
was. The singular verb was matches the singular subject I.
u
were. The subject is guards; there is never a subject. Guards is plural and takes the plural 
verb were.
v
was. Ignore the interrupters (as well as . . . Alissa) and zero in on the real subject David. Match
the singular verb was to the singular subject.

31
Chapter 2: Matchmaker, Make Me a Match: Pairing Subjects and Verbs Correctly
w
is. The subject is arrest, not charges or variety. Arrest is singular, so you need the singular verb is.
x
were. Add one movie director to one agent and what do you get? A big fat check, that’s what . . .
and a plural subject that takes the plural verb were.
y
include. The subject is offers, which matches the plural verb include. Everything else is 
camouflage.
A
waddle. The subjects in this sentence appear at the end of the sentence. David and Kristin =
plural, so pair them with the plural verb waddle.
B
has. Pay no attention to series, which is a distraction. The real subject is producer, which needs
the singular verb has.
C
is. The little word or tells you to take the subjects one at a time, thus requiring the singular
verb is.
D
Is. The subject is hope, which takes the singular verb is.
E
broadcasts. The subject is Network. Don’t be distracted by the interrupter but not its partner sta-
tions. Network needs the singular verb broadcasts.
F
are. You can count dancers, so are is best.
G
has. Without a partner, either is always singular and rates a singular verb, such as has.
H
is. The word every may as well be Kryptonite, because it has the power to change seat and 
balcony to a singular concept requiring the singular verb is.
I
does. The subject is no one, which is singular, so it must be paired with does, a singular verb.
J
have. The pronoun most may be singular (if it’s used with a measurable quantity) or plural 
(if it’s used with a countable quantity). You can count songs, so the plural have is best.
K
has, is. The pronouns ending in -one are always singular, even though they seem to convey a
plural idea at times. They need to be matched with singular verbs.
L
is. The closest subject is Lola, so the singular verb is wins the prize, the only prize likely to be
associated with Lola’s musical.
M
have. The pronoun any may be either singular or plural, depending upon the quantity to which
it refers. Reviews may be counted (and you can be sure that Lola’s investors will count them
extremely carefully), so any takes the plural verb have in this sentence.
N
Has. This sentence can be decided by distance. The sentence has two subjects, director and musi-
cians. The verb in this sentence has two parts, has and agreed. The subject director is closer to
the part of the verb that changes (the has or the have); agreed is the same for both singular and
plural subjects. The changeable part of the verb is the one that governs the singular/plural issue.
Because that part of the verb is near the singular subject director, the singular has is correct.
O
agrees. The singular verb agrees matches the singular subject everyone.
P
are. The pronoun most can be either singular or plural. In this sentence, members can be
counted (and it won’t take too long, either, once the reviews are in), so the plural verb are is
what you want.

Q
has. The pronoun neither is always singular and needs to be paired with the singular verb has.
R
is. Did I catch you here? The expression 20 tattoos suggests plural, but the subject is actually
one, a singular.
S
are. You can count tattoos, so the pronoun some is a plural subject and needs to match the
plural verb are.
T
has. The word each has the power to turn any subject to singular; has is a singular verb.
U
is. You can measure, but not count, fame, so a singular verb matches the singular pronoun all.
V
believe. Accountants are countable, so all is plural in this sentence and needs the plural verb
believe.
W
Has. The pronoun someone, like all the pronouns ending in -one, is singular, and so is the 
verb has.
X
are, enters. In an either/or sentence, go with the closer subject, in this case, producers. Because
producers is plural, it is paired with are, a plural verb. The singular verb enters matches the sin-
gular pronoun nobody. All pronouns ending with -body are singular.
Y
is. The word every has the ability to make the subject singular, matching the singular verb is.
z
has. The pronoun neither is singular, so the singular verb has is needed here.
Z
has. Pronouns ending in -one are always singular and thus always match with singular verbs.
Here the subject is someone, so has wins.
1
are. The pronoun both is plural, as is the verb are.
2
Was. This sentence illustrates a common error. The pronoun either is singular and calls for the
singular verb was. If I had a nickel for every time I heard someone pair either with a plural, I
could retire to a luxury hotel and sip margaritas all day.
3
Is. A sentence with an either/or combo is easy; just match the verb to the closest subject. In
this sentence, the singular Lola is closer to the verb than brothers, so you need a singular verb.
4
believe. The pronoun most shifts from singular to plural and back, depending upon context. If
it’s associated with something that you can count (such as us), it’s plural. Tacked onto some-
thing that you can measure but not count (fame, perhaps), most becomes singular. Here most is
plural and joins with the plural verb believe.
5
sparkle. Some is a pronoun that may be either singular or plural, like most in the preceding
explanation. Here it’s associated with Oscars, a countable item. Thus the plural verb sparkle is
the one you want.
6
is. This sentence has another changeable pronoun; this time it’s all. As explained in the preced-
ing two answers, all is singular if it’s attached to something that you can’t count, such as atten-
tion. Go for the singular verb is.

attend. Any sentence with a neither/nor pair requires a ruler: The subject that’s closer to the
verb dominates. If the closer subject is singular, go for a singular verb. If the closer subject is
plural, opt for a plural verb. In this sentence the plural costars is closer to the verb than the 
singular Tom Cruise, so a plural verb (that is, attend) is called for.

Dear Adelie,
 
Oh, my little fluffy sweetheart, how I long to be with you on this 
cold, cold day! Neither of the iron bars of my cell have has kept me from 
dreaming about sweeping you away to our long-planned vacation in 
Antarctica. Through the vast blue skys skies, speeding swiftly as wild 
turkies turkeys, go goes my heart.
 
Either my jailors or my honey, who is the best of all possible 
honies honeys, have has taken over every thought in my brain. I never 
think about the fishes fish in the sea. Every single one of my waking 
moments are is devoted to you, cuddliest of all the cuddly teddy 
bear bears.
 
But, Cow Pat, I and all the other prisoners, except for my 
cellmate, has have waited impatiently for your visit. Two months has have 
passed, and everyone (though not the cellmate, as I said) are is impatient. 
I know you was were busy, but the taxs taxes are paid, your new downhill 
racing skies skis are waxed (I know you love to ski!), and still you is are 
not here!
 
Here is are two tickets for the policemans policemen you 
befriended. They can accompany you on the train. (I know you hate to 
travel alone.) Speaking of alone, please bring the loots loot from our last 
job. I need escape money. Also bring two gold watchs watches, which 
are very handy for bribes.

Chapter 3
Who Is She, and What Is It? The
Lowdown on Pronouns
In This Chapter
 Sorting singular and plural pronouns
 Using possessive pronouns correctly
 Avoiding double meanings
 Dealing with confusing pronouns
P
ronouns aren’t for amateurs, at least when it comes to formal grammar. These tricky little
words (most are quite short) take the place of nouns and frequently come in handy. Who
can make a sentence without I, me, ours, them, us, that, and similar words? Unfortunately, pro-
nouns can trip you up in a hundred ways. Never fear: In this chapter I show you how to distin-
guish singular from plural pronouns (and when to use each) and how to use possessive
pronouns (the kind that won’t let you go out on Saturday night). I also help you avoid vague
pronouns and guide you through the maze of its/it’s, their/there/they’re, whose/who’s, and
your/you’re.
Separating Singular and Plural Pronouns
Pronouns bump nouns from your sentences and make the words flow more smoothly. When
choosing pronouns, you must follow two basic rules:
 Replace a singular noun with a singular pronoun.
 Replace a plural noun with a plural pronoun.
Pronouns have another characteristic — gender. Fortunately, the rules governing pronoun
gender are nowhere near as complicated as the ones about who pays for what on the first
date. Masculine pronouns (he, him, himself) take the place of masculine nouns, and feminine
pronouns (she, her, herself) fill in for feminine nouns. Some pronouns are noncombatants in
the gender wars (it, itself, who, which, and that, for example) and function in a neutral way.
Other rules also govern pronoun behavior, but I’ll leave those for another time and place —
specifically Chapters 2, 10, and 11, and, for those who want to perfect the most obsessive
points of pronoun usage, Chapter 21.

Just for the record, here are the most common singular and plural pronouns:
 Singular: I, me, you, he, she, it, my, your, his, her, its, myself, yourself, himself,
herself, itself, either, neither, everyone, anyone, someone, no one, everything,
anything, something, nothing, everybody, anybody, somebody, nobody, each,
and every
 Plural: we, us, you, they, them, our, ours, your, yours, their, theirs, ourselves,
yourselves, themselves, both, and few
The -self pronouns — myself, himself, and so on — have very limited usage. They can
add emphasis (I myself will blow up the mud balloon) or circle back to the person
doing the action in the sentence (She will clean herself later). If you’re tempted to use
a -self pronoun without the circling back action (Rachel and myself hate mud balloons,
for example), resist the temptation.
Okay, get to work. Without peeking at the answers (and I am watching), decide which
pronoun may replace the underlined noun. Consider the singular/plural and gender
issues. Write your choice in the blank provided.
Q. I hope that Charlie Burke and Dr. Eileen Burke will attend tonight’s symphony, even
though Charlie is tone deaf and Eileen tends to sing along during the quieter moments.
_______________
A. she. Dr. Eileen has been known to hit the doughnut tray a little too often, but Eileen is still
just one person. She is a singular, feminine pronoun.

the fashion press. _______________

Taking Possession of the Right Pronoun
When I was a kid I often heard the expression, “Possession is nine-tenths of the law.” I
never quite understood the legal meaning, but I do know that possessive pronouns
(my, mine, your, his, her, hers, its, our, ours, their, theirs, and whose) are governed by
just a few, easy laws:
 Use a possessive pronoun to show ownership.
 Match singular pronouns with singular owners.
 Match plural pronouns with plural owners.
 Take note of masculine (for males), feminine (for female), and neutral pronouns.
 Never insert an apostrophe into a possessive pronoun. (If a pronoun has an apos-
trophe, it’s a contraction. See the next section for more information.)
Okay, here’s a mini-test. Choose the correct possessive pronoun from the choices in
parentheses and plop it into the blank.
Q. The little boy grabbed a grubby handkerchief and wiped _____ nose. (his/her/its/he’s)
A. his. Because you’re talking about a little boy, you need a masculine pronoun. Did I catch
you with the last choice? He’s = he is.
16. Jessica spent the morning polishing _____ new motorcycle, for which she had paid a rock-
bottom price. (her/hers/she’s/her’s)

It’s All in the Details: Possessives 
versus Contractions
Think of this section as a map of a desert island with “scary monster’s favorite cave,”
“poisoned water source,” and “cannibal headquarters” clearly labeled. In other words,
this section points out some dangers in the pronoun world and shows you how to steer
clear of them. Specifically, I take you through the wonderful world of its/it’s, their/there/
they’re, and whose/who’s. Briefly, here’s how to tell them apart:
 Its/it’s: The first shows possession (the bird grasped a seed in its beak), and the
second is a contraction meaning it is.
 Their/there/they’re: The first shows possession (the birds grasped seeds in
their beaks). The second is a location (don’t go there). The third is a contraction
meaning they are.
 Whose/who’s: The first shows possession (the bird whose beak is longest). The
second is a contraction meaning who is.
38
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

Try the following questions. Choose the correct word from the choices in parenthe-
ses. Underline your selection.
Q. Marybelle sewed (their/there/they’re) lips shut because the little brats refused to keep
quiet.
A. their. The sentence expresses possession, so you want the first choice. The second there
is location, and the third means they are. If you plug they are into the sentence, you’re not
making any sense.
36. George and Josh need watches because (their/there/they’re) always late.
37. George found a watch that keeps atomic time, but (its/it’s) too expensive.
38. Josh, playing with the atomic watch, broke (its/it’s) band.
39. I notice that (your/you’re) band is broken also.
40. “(Whose/Who’s) watch is this?” Josh asked innocently.
41. “(Your/You’re) sure that (its/it’s) not Jessica’s?” asked George.
42. “Put it over (their/there/they’re) and pretend you never touched it,” said George.
43. “I can’t lie,” whispered Josh. “(Their/There/They’re) security cameras caught me.”
44. (Its/It’s) impossible for Josh to lie anyway because he is totally honest.
45. “(Your/You’re) honor demands only the truth,” sighed George.
46. (Whose/Who’s) going to pay for the watch, you may wonder, Josh or George?
47. (Your/You’re) wrong; Josh isn’t willing to pay the full cost.
48. (Their/There/They’re) funds are limited, so each will probably pay half the cost of a new
watch band.
49. George, (whose/who’s) ideas of right and wrong are somewhat fuzzy, asked Rachel
whether she would contribute to (their/there/they’re) “charity campaign for underprivi-
leged watches.”
50. Rachel replied, “(Your/You’re) joking!”
51. “(Whose/Who’s) going to help my watch?” she added.
52. “I don’t think (its/it’s) battery has ever been changed,” continued Rachel.
53. (Its/It’s) slowing down, according to Rachel, as the battery begins to die.
54. George told Rachel, “(Your/You’re) battery is crucial and should be changed or recharged
regularly.”
55. “Who thinks about batteries?” commented Jessica. “(Their/There/They’re) easy to 
overlook.”

Avoiding Double Meanings
Unless you’re a politician bent on hiding the fact that you’ve just increased taxes on
everything but bubble gum, you’re probably interested in communicating clearly.
Double meanings, the darling of all sorts of elected officials, have no place in your
speaking and writing, right? Self-interest dictates that you choose a pronoun that
can’t be misunderstood because accuracy and specificity in pronouns invariably lead
to the correct interpretation of your meaning. One basic rule says it all:
If any confusion arises about the meaning of a pronoun, dump it and opt for a
noun instead.
In practice, this rule means that you shouldn’t say things like “My aunt and her
mother-in-law were happy about her success in the Scrabble tournament,” because
you don’t know who had success, the aunt, the mother-in-law, or some other lady.
College entrance exams often hit you with a double-meaning sentence. Frequently the
faulty pronoun is underlined. When asked to point out the error, keep your eye out for
double-meaning pronouns.
Pronoun practice now begins. Hit these exercises with brainpower, rewriting if a pro-
noun may have more than one meaning. (When you rewrite, choose one of the possi-
bilities, or, if you love to work, provide two new unmistakably clear sentences. If
everything is hunky-dory, write “correct” in the blank.
Q. Stacy and Alice photographed her tattoos.
________________________________________________________________________________
A. Stacy and Alice photographed Alice’s tattoos. Or, Stacy and Alice photographed Stacy’s
tattoos. Which answer is better? Neither. If you’re saying something like this in real life,
you know whose tattoos are under the lens. The reason the sentence needs a revision 
is that either meaning fits the original. To be clear, rewrite without the pronoun.

Sharpen your (that’s your, not you’re) editing skills. Look for ten mistakes involving
pronouns in the letter in Figure 3-1, written by an unfortunate merchant. After you
find an error, correct it. Take note of singular/plural, gender, clarity, and confusion.
Dear Mr. Baker:
Its come to my attention that the watch you looked at yesterday in our 
Central Avenue store is broken. The band is disconnected from the 
watch, which is quite valuable. Their is no record of payment beyond a 
very small amount. The clerk, Mr. Sievers, told me that you paid her 
exactly 1 percent of the watch’s price. When you and you’re brother left 
the store, Mr. Sievers was still asking for additional funds. He’s blood 
pressure still has not returned to normal levels.
Frankly I do not care whose to blame for the broken watchband or Mr. 
Sievers’s medical problem. I simply want it fixed. The watch and it’s band 
are not your property. The store needs their merchandise in good 
condition.

Answers to Pronoun Problems
a
it. The hat is singular, and so is it.
b
they. More than one photographer means that you need the plural pronoun they.
c
it. The hairpiece is singular and has no gender, so it is the best choice.
d
us. Two nouns are underlined, so you’re in plural territory. Because Eileen is talking about her-
self and Charlie, us fits here.
e
she. Mama is a singular feminine noun, so she is your best bet.
f
themselves. Two people make a plural, so themselves, a plural pronoun, is best.
g
he or she. You don’t know whether the subway conductor is male or female, though you do
know that you’re talking about one and only one person. The best answer is he or she, covering
all the bases.
h
you. Because the conductor is talking to Eileen, you is the best choice. You, by the way, func-
tions as both a singular and a plural.
i
they. Cars is a plural noun, so they works best.
j
me. Because Eileen is talking about herself, me is your answer.
k
she. The singular, feminine (she always wears a skirt, never pants!) Eileen calls for a singular,
feminine pronoun, in this case, she.
l
he. The singular, masculine (he never wears a skirt) Henry Todd calls for a singular, masculine
pronoun, he.
m
it. The singular bus isn’t masculine or feminine, so it fills the bill.
n
me. Eileen is talking about herself here (not a surprise, because she never talks about anything
else!), so me is appropriate.
o
you. The driver is talking to Eileen, using the pronoun you.
p
her. You need a feminine singular pronoun, no apostrophe. Bingo: her.
q
its. I placed a trap here: her. The sentence does refer to a female, but the female doesn’t have a
fender; the cycle does. Thus you need the possessive pronoun its.
r
theirs. One of the choices — their’s — doesn’t exist in proper English. The first choice, their,
should precede the thing that is possessed (their books, for example). The middle choice is just
right.
s
mine. The last two choices don’t exist in standard English. My does its job by preceding the
possession (my blanket, for example). The second choice, mine, can stand alone.
t
theirs. You need a word to express plural possession, because you’re talking about Neil and
Rachel. Of the three plural choices (the last three), the first should precede the possession
(their motorcycle, for example), and the second has an apostrophe, a giant no-no in possessive-
pronoun world. Only the last choice works.
43
Chapter 3: Who Is She, and What Is It? The Lowdown on Pronouns

u
his. The hairpiece belongs to Neil, so her, a feminine pronoun, is out. The last choice is a con-
traction of he is.
v
its. The first choice isn’t possessive, so you can rule it out easily. The second choice is plural,
but the pronoun refers to poodle, a singular noun. Bingo: The last choice, a singular possessive,
is correct.
w
his. No possessive pronoun ever contains an apostrophe, so the first choice is the only possi-
bility. He’s, by the way, means he is.
x
its. Did I catch you here? In everyday speech, people often refer to stores and businesses as
“they,” with the possessive form “their.” However, a store or a business is properly referred to
with a singular pronoun. The logic is easy to figure out. One store = singular. So Matthews
Department Store is singular, and the possessive pronoun that refers to it is its.
y
my. The pronoun mine stands alone and doesn’t precede what is owned. My, on the other hand,
is a pronoun that can’t stand being alone. A true party animal, it must precede what is being
owned (in this sentence, actions).
A
yours. In contrast to sentence 25, this sentence needs a pronoun that stands alone. Your must
be placed in front of whatever is being possessed — not a possibility in this sentence. All the
choices with apostrophes are out because possessive pronouns don’t have apostrophes. The
only thing left is yours, which is the correct choice.
B
his. The contraction he’s means he is. That choice doesn’t make sense. The second choice is
wrong because possessive pronouns don’t have apostrophes.
C
ours. Okay, first dump all the apostrophe choices, because apostrophes and possessive pro-
nouns don’t mix. You’re left with two choices — our and ours. The second is best because our
needs to precede the thing that is possessed, and ours can stand alone.
D
his. The possessive pronoun his, like all possessive pronouns, has no apostrophe. The last
choice, he’s, means he is and isn’t possessive at all.
E
mine. The pronoun mine works alone (it secretly wants to be a private detective, operating
solo). In this sentence it has a slot for itself after the preposition of. Perfect!
F
my. The form that attaches to the front of a noun is my. In this sentence, my precedes and is
linked to dead body.
G
your. The possessive pronoun your has no apostrophe. The second choice, yours, doesn’t
attach to a noun, so you have to rule it out in this sentence.The last choice, you’re, is short for
you are.
H
her. Right away you can dump the last choice, her’s, because possessive pronouns are allergic
to apostrophes. The pronoun hers works alone, but here the blank precedes the item pos-
sessed, fingers. Her is the possessive you want.
I
their.  Because you’re talking about both Jessica and Neil, go for their, the plural.
J
our. In this sentence the possessive pronoun has to include me, so our is the winner. Ours isn’t
appropriate because you need a pronoun to precede what is being possessed (hairpieces). As
always, apostrophes and possessive pronouns don’t mix.
K
they’re. The sentence tells you that they are always late, and the short form of they are is
they’re.
44
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

L
it’s. The meaning needed here: it is too expensive. No possessive is called for.
M
its. The band belongs to the watch, so possession is indicated. The possessive pronoun its does
the job.
N
your. The contraction you’re is short for you are, clearly not right for this context.
O
Whose. The sentence doesn’t say, “Who is watch is this?” so go for the possessive whose.
P
You’re, it’s. Two pronouns, neither possessive. The sentence really means “You are sure that it
is not Jessica’s?”
Q
there. The meaning of the sentence calls for a location, so there is the one you want.
R
Their. The security cameras belong to them, so their is needed to show possession.
S
It’s. The sentence should begin with “It is impossible” and it’s = it is.
T
Your. A possessive is called for here, not a contraction (You’re = You are).
U
Who’s. The sentence should begin with Who is, and who’s = who is.
V
You’re. Here you want the contraction you’re = you are.
W
Their. The funds belong to them, so their is needed to show possession.
X
whose, their. Both spots require a possessive, showing that the fuzzy ideas belong to George
and that the campaign belongs to both George and his more honest brother Josh.
Y
You’re. The joking isn’t a possession. The sentence calls for the contraction you’re = you are.
z
Who’s. You need Who is in this sentence, so go for the contraction.
Z
its. The battery belongs to the watch, so the possessive pronoun its fits well here. The contrac-
tion (it’s, for it is), doesn’t belong here at all.
1
It’s. In this sentence you want the contraction of it is.
2
Your. Here the possessive pronoun is called for, to show that the battery belongs to you.
3
They’re. The contraction They are makes sense in this sentence, not the possessive their or the
location word there.
4
correct. Chad is male and his sister is female, so she may refer only to one person, Chad’s
sister. No double meanings, so no corrections.

Chad sent a donation to Mr. Hobson in hope of furthering Chad’s cause. Or, Chad sent a pres-
ent to Mr. Hobson in hope of furthering Mr. Hobson’s cause. The problem with the original 
is the his. Does his mean Chad’s or Mr. Hobson’s? The way the original reads, either answer is
possible.

If Chad wins an Oscar, he will place the statue on his desk, next to his Emmy, Tony, Obie,
and Best-of-the-Bunch awards. The Oscar is his favorite honor. Okay, maybe the Tony is his
favorite honor, or maybe the Obie. The original is so unclear that almost anything may be
plugged into the blank. Whichever one you choose, fine. Just don’t let It stand for any one 
of five awards, which is what it does in the original.

7
correct. The two pronouns in this sentence, her and who, can only refer to Chad’s sister.
Everything is clear, and no changes are necessary.
8
Rachel, who served as a model for Chad’s sister, thought her own interpretation was the
best. Or, Rachel, who served as a model for Chad’s sister, thought the sister’s interpretation
was the best. Either answer is okay, illustrating the problem with the original. You can’t tell
what her means — Rachel’s or Chad’s sister’s.

In the film, the artist creates giant sculptures out of discarded hubcaps, although the hub-
caps are seldom appreciated by museum curators. Or, In the film the artist creates giant
sculptures out of discarded hubcaps, although these sculptures are seldom appreciated by
museum curators. The problem with the original sentence is the pronoun these. (Did you know
that that, this, these, and those may function as pronouns?) You have two groups of objects in
the sentence: the sculptures and the hubcaps. These could refer to either. To eliminate the
uncertainty, replace these with a more specific statement.
0
Rachel was pleased to be allowed to keep the leftover chair cushions and hubcaps. Or,
Rachel liked the leftover chair cushions, which she was allowed to keep. She also held onto
the hubcaps. Or, Rachel liked the leftover hubcaps, which she was allowed to keep. She also
kept the chair cushions. If you’ve read all three suggested answers (and more variations are
possible), you understand the problem with the original sentence. What does which mean?
Cushions? Hubcaps? Keeping leftovers? That last possibility, by the way, can’t be expressed by a
pronoun, at least not according to the strictest grammar cops. Reword so that your reader
knows what which means.
!
correct. Surprised? All the pronouns are clear, in the context of this story about Rachel. The
she refers to Rachel, and the which refers to objects.
@
Chad’s sister kept one hubcap for a souvenir. Or, Chad’s sister kept one sculpture for a sou-
venir. Or, Chad’s sister kept one Rachel for a souvenir. Just kidding about the last possible
answer. (There’s only one Rachel.) In the original sentence, one is too vague. Clarify by adding a
specific souvenir.
#
correct. The sentence refers to two females (Rachel and Chad’s sister) and one male. Because
only one male is in the sentence, the masculine pronouns he and his are clear.
$
Rachel remarked to Chad’s sister, “Chad can drink my iced tea if he is thirsty.” Or, Rachel
remarked to Chad’s sister, “Chad can drink your iced tea if he is thirsty.” In the original sen-
tence, you can’t tell whether her refers to Rachel or to Chad’s sister. 
%
Chad called his brother and asked him to bring the cream from Chad’s refrigerator. If you
want to make Chad a cheapo who is always mooching someone else’s stuff, reword the sen-
tence so that Chad is asking for his brother’s cream, perhaps using a direct quotation, as in
Chad called his brother and asked, “Bring me some cream from your refrigerator.”
^
“Are you crazy?” asked Rachel, giving her own straw to Chad’s sister. Or, “Are you crazy?”
asked Rached as she picked up Chad’s sister’s straw and gave it to her. The original sentence
doesn’t make clear who owns the straw.
&
Chad’s sister took a straw and a packet of sugar, stirred her coffee, and then placed the
coffee on the table. The original sentence contains a pronoun (it) with several possible mean-
ings (the straw, the sugar packet, or the coffee).

which and the watch is quite valuable. Their There is no record of 
payment beyond a very small amount. The clerk, Mr. Sievers, told me that 
you paid her him exactly 1 percent of the watch’s price. When you and 
you’re your brother left the store, Mr. Sievers was still asking for 
additional funds. He’s His blood pressure still has not returned to normal 
levels.
Frankly I do not care whose who’s to blame for the broken watchband or 
Mr. Sievers’s medical problem. I simply want it the band fixed. The watch 
and it’s its band are not your property. The store needs their its 
merchandise in good condition.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

Finishing What You Start: 
Writing Complete Sentences
In This Chapter
 Recognizing what makes a sentence complete
 Avoiding fragments and run-ons
 Combining sentences legally
 Placing endmarks properly
H
ave you heard the story about the child who says nothing for the first five years of his
life and then begins to speak in perfect, complete sentences? Supposedly the kid grew
up to be something important, like a Supreme Court Justice or a CEO. I question the story’s
accuracy, but I don’t doubt that Supreme Court Justices, CEOs, and everyone else with a
good job know how to write a complete sentence.
You need to know how to do so too, and in this chapter I give you a complete (pardon the
pun) guide to sentence completeness, including how to punctuate and how to combine
thoughts using proper grammar.
To write a proper, complete sentence, follow these rules:
 Every sentence needs a subject/verb pair. More than one pair is okay, but at least one
is essential. Just to be clear about the grammar terms: a verb expresses action or state
of being; a subject tells you who or what is acting or being.
 A complete sentence contains a complete thought. Don’t leave the reader hanging
with only half an idea. (“If it rains” = incomplete thought, but “If it rains, my paper
dress will dissolve” = complete and truly bizarre thought.)
 Two or more ideas in a sentence must be joined correctly. You can’t just jam every-
thing together. If you do, you end up with a run-on or a “fused” sentence, which is a
grammatical felony. Punctuation marks and what grammarians call conjunctions — 
joining words — glue ideas together legally.
 Every sentence finishes up with an endmark. Endmarks include periods, question
marks, and exclamation points.
Just four little rules. Piece of cake, right? In theory, yes. But sometimes applying the rules
gets a little complicated. In the following sections I take you through each rule, one at a
time, so you can practice each step.

Seeking Out the Subject/Verb Pair
The subject/verb pair is the heart and soul of the sentence. To check your creation,
zero in on the verb. At least one word must express action or a state of being. Next look
for a word that expresses who or what is doing that action or is in that state of being;
that’s the subject. Now for one more, essential step: Check to see that the subject and
verb match. They must go together and make sense (“Mike has been singing,” “Lindsay
suffered,” and so forth). For practice on properly matching subjects and verbs, flip to
Chapter 2.
Some words that look like verbs don’t function as verbs. So you may wrongly identify a
verb. Checking for a match between a subject and a verb eliminates these false verbs
from consideration, because the pairs sound incomplete with false verbs. A couple of
mismatches illustrate my point: “Lindsay watching,” “Mike’s message having been
scrambled.”
You try some. In the blank, write the subject (S)/verb (V) pair. If you find no true pair,
write “incomplete.” (By the way, Duke, who appears several times in the following
sentences, is my grand-dog.)
Q. Mike, with a cholesterol count climbing higher and higher, gave in and fried some
sausages. ______________________________
A. Mike (S)/gave (V), fried (V). Did I catch you with climbing? In the preceding sentence,
climbing isn’t a verb. One clue: cholesterol count climbing sounds incomplete. Just for 
comparison, cholesterol count is climbing makes a match. See the difference?
1. Duke, sighing repeatedly and frustrated by her inability to score more than ten points at
the dog show. ______________________________
2. Dogcatcher Charlie fed a chopped steak to Truffle, his favorite entry in the Dog of the
Century contest. ______________________________
3. Duke, my favorite entry, snarfed a bowl of liver treats and woofed for about an hour 
afterward. ______________________________
4. Entered in the Toy breed category, Duke is sure to win the Most Likely to Fall Asleep
Standing Up contest. ______________________________
5. Having been tired out by a heavy schedule of eating, chewing, and pooping.
______________________________
6. Duke sleeps profoundly. ______________________________
7. Once, having eaten through the kibble bag and increased the size of her stomach by at
least 50 percent. ______________________________
8. One of the other dogs, biting the vet gently just to make a point about needles and her
preference not to have them. ______________________________
9. The vet is not upset by Duke’s reaction. ______________________________
10. Who would be surprised by a runoff between Truffle and Duke?
______________________________
50
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

11. Not surprised by anything, especially with liver treats. ______________________________
12. Truffle, sniffing the new dog toy on the couch. ______________________________
13. Toto, the winner of last century’s contest in running, jumping, and sleeping.

14. Duke is guided by a strong handler around the judges’ platform and television booth.

15. Duke loves her time in the spotlight and the attention from the national media.

16. Dogcatcher Charlie, covered in tanning cream and catching a few rays at the side of the
arena. ______________________________
17. Truffle and Duke sniffed the tanning cream while running around the arena.
______________________________
18. Swiftly across the arena sped the two dogs. ______________________________
19. Stopping next to Dogcatcher Charlie at the arena wall, Truffle and Duke.
______________________________
20. They lapped a few gallons of tanning cream from his skin.
______________________________
Checking for Complete Thoughts
Some subject/verb pairs form a closed circle: The thought they express is complete.
That’s the quality you want, because otherwise your reader echoes the outlaw who,
with his head in the noose, said: “Don’t leave me hanging!”
Some expressions are incomplete when they’re statements but complete when they’re
questions. To illustrate my point: “Who won?” makes sense, but “Who won” doesn’t.
Try this one on for size. If you have a complete thought, write “complete.” If the reader
is left in suspense, write “incomplete.” Remember, the number of words doesn’t indi-
cate completeness. The thought does.
Q. Whenever the cow jumps over the moon. _______________
A. incomplete. Aren’t you wondering, “What happens whenever the cow jumps over the
moon?” The thought is not complete.
21. The cow, who used to work for NASA until she got fed up with the bureaucracy.

Going for Flow: Joining Sentences Correctly
Some sentences are short. Some are long. Joining them is good. Combined sentences
make a narrative more interesting. Have I convinced you yet? The choppiness of the
preceding sentences makes a good case for gluing sentences together. Just be sure to
do so legally, or else you’ll end up with a run-on sentence.
To join sentences correctly, you need one of the following:
 A conjunction: Don’t worry about the grammatical terminology. But if you must
know, a conjunction is a verbal rubber band that unites things. To connect two
complete sentences more or less equally, use and, or, but, nor, and for, and put 
a comma before the conjunctions. To highlight one thought and make the 
other less important, use such conjunctions as because, since, when, where, if,
although, who, which, and that — among others. These conjunctions are some-
times preceded by commas and sometimes not. For more information on comma
use, check out Chapter 5.
 A semicolon: A semicolon (a little dot over a comma) pops up between two com-
plete sentences and glues them together nicely. The two complete thoughts need
to be related in some way.
Some words look like conjunctions, but aren’t. Don’t use nevertheless, consequently,
therefore, however, or then to join complete thoughts. If you want to place one of these
“false conjunctions” between two complete thoughts, add a semicolon and place a
comma after the “false conjunction.” For more information on commas, see Chapter 5.
52
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 

Okay, put on your thinking cap and decide whether you have a legally combined, cor-
rect sentence or (gasp) an illegal, glued-together mess. In the blank after the sen-
tence, write “correct” or “incorrect.” Likewise, take a stab at changing the messes to
legal, complete sentences. Notice the teacher trick? I provide space to revise every
sentence, including the correct ones, so you can’t judge the legal sentences by the
length of the blanks.
Q. Kathy broke out of jail, five years for illegal sentence-joining was just too much for her.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
A. incorrect. Kathy broke out of jail; five years for illegal sentence-joining was just too
much for her. The comma can’t unite two complete thoughts. Change it to a semicolon
and you’re in business. An alternate correction: Kathy broke out of jail because five
years for illegal sentence-joining was just too much for her. The because connects the
two ideas correctly.
36. The grammarian-in-chief used to work for the Supreme Court, therefore his word was law.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
37. His nickname, “Mr. Grammar,” which had been given to him by the court clerks, was not a

________________________________________________________________________________
Finishing with Flair: Choosing Endmarks
When you’re speaking, the listener knows you’ve completed a sentence because the
thought is complete and your tone says that the end has arrived. In writing, the tone
part is taken care of by a period, question mark, or exclamation point. You must 
have one, and only one, of these marks at the end of a sentence, unless you’re writing
a comic book, in which characters are allowed to say things like “You want my
what??!!?” Periods are for statements, question marks are for (surprise) questions,
and exclamation points scream at the reader. Endmarks become complicated when
they tangle with quotation marks. For tips on endmark/quotation mark interactions,
check out Chapter 8.
Punch the time clock now and go to work on this section, which is filled with sen-
tences desperately in need of an endmark. Write the appropriate endmark in the
blank provided.

Complete or Incomplete? That Is the Question
Time to get it together, as quite a few second-rate songwriters sang during the 1960s,
one of my favorite decades that I almost remember. If you’ve plowed your way
through this entire chapter (and if you have, my compliments), you’ve practiced each
sentence skill separately. But to write well, you have to do everything at once —
create subject/verb pairs, finish a thought, combine thoughts properly, and place the
appropriate endmark.
Length and completeness aren’t related. A very long sentence may be incomplete.
Similarly, a very short sentence (“Grammar bores me,” for example) may be com-
plete. Make sure that the sentence follows the rules outlined in this chapter instead of
counting words.
Take a test drive with the questions in this section. Decide whether the sentence is
complete or incomplete and plop a label in the blank. If the sentence is incomplete,
repair the damage. Notice that I’ve cleverly included a fix-it blank even for sentences
that are already correct. In the military, that’s called camouflage. In teaching, it’s
called a dirty trick.
Q. Though the spaghetti sticks to the ceiling above the pan on rainy days when even one
more problem will send me over the edge.

________________________________________________________________________________
A. incomplete. The statement has no complete thought. Possible correction: Omit “Though”
and begin the sentence with “The.”

at romance than grammar, managed to write ten sentences about Alissa’s charms, but
only five are complete and correct. Can you find the five that don’t make the grade?
Dear Alissa,
Your smile, with its capped teeth and strikingly attractive knotty pine 
denture. I can think of nothing I would rather do than contemplate the 
gap between your molars. Inspired by your eyebrows, I think of stars, 
constellations, and furry little bears. In the future, when I will have the 
time to write poetry about those brows. Your nose alone merits a poem, a 
sonnet should be dedicated to its nostrils. A wrestler would be proud to 
have a neck such as yours. Your shoulders slope invitingly, moreover, 
your hips swivel better than my office chair. Across those noble 
shoulders slides your hair, as thick as extra-strength glue. How can I 
forget your eyes I am yours forever, Alissa, unless I get distracted by a 
better offer.

Answers to Complete Sentence Problems
a
incomplete. Did you zero in on sighing? That’s part of a verb (a present participle, if you
absolutely have to know), but all by itself it isn’t enough to fill the verb category. Likewise, if
you try to pair sighing with a subject, the only candidate is Duke. Duke is sighing would be a
match, but Duke sighing isn’t. No subject/verb pair, no sentence.
b
Dogcatcher (S)/fed (V). Start with a verb search. Any action or being verbs? Yes, fed. Now ask
who or what fed. Bingo: dogcatcher fed. You have a good subject/verb match.
c
Duke (S)/snarfed (V), woofed (V). Your verb search (always the best first step) yields two,
snarfed and woofed. Who snarfed and woofed? Duke. There you go — an acceptable subject/
verb pair.
d
Duke (S)/is (V). Were you tricked by entered? Entered may be a verb in some sentences, but in
this one it isn’t, because it has no subject. But is does have a subject, Duke.
e
incomplete. Something’s missing here: a subject and a verb! What you have, in grammarspeak,
is a participle, a part of a verb, but not enough to satisfy the subject/verb rule.
f
Duke (S)/sleeps (V). Start with a verb search, and you immediately come up with sleeps, which,
by the way, is an action verb, even though sleeping seems like the opposite of action. Who
sleeps? Duke, bless her snoring little self.
g
incomplete. You have some action — having eaten — but no subject. Penalty box!
h
incomplete. The sentence has action (biting), but when you ask who’s biting, you get no answer,
because one biting is a mismatch.
i
vet (S)/is (V). No action in this one, but is expresses being, so you’re covered on the verb front.
Who or what is? The vet is.
j
Who (S)/would be (V). Are you surprised to see who as a subject? In a question, who often fills
that role.
k
incomplete. A quick glance tells you that you have a verb form (surprised), but no subject.
l
incomplete. Another verb form (sniffing) is easy to find here, but when you ask who is doing
the sniffing, you come up blank. Truffle sniffing doesn’t match.
m
incomplete. In this one you have a subject, Toto, but no matching verb. True, the statement
talks about running, jumping, and sleeping, but those aren’t matches for Toto. (If you care,
they’re actually nouns functioning as objects of the preposition in.)
n
Duke (S)/is guided (V). Start with a verb search. Any action or being verbs? Yes, is guided.
Now ask who or what is guided. Bingo: Duke is guided. You have a good subject/verb match.
o
Duke (S)/loves (V). A verb hunt gives you loves, and asking that universal question (who loves?)
yields Duke loves. Bingo — a subject/verb pair and a legal sentence.
p
incomplete. Dogcatcher Charlie makes a fine subject, but in this one he’s not matched with a
verb. The two verb forms in the statement, covered and catching, describe Charlie. (They’re par-
ticiples, if you like these grammar terms.) Neither makes a good match. Charlie covered sounds
like a match, but the meaning here is incorrect because Charlie isn’t performing the action of
covering. Charlie catching sounds like a mismatch because it is.

60
Part I: Laying Out the Concrete Slab: Grammar Basics 
q
Truffle (S), Duke (S)/sniffed (V). First, find the verb. If you sniff around this sentence looking
for an action word, you come up with sniffed. Now ask, Who sniffed? Bingo: Truffle and Duke
sniffed. A good compound (double) subject for a good verb — you’re all set with a complete
sentence.
r
dogs (S)/sped (V). This one may have surprised you because the subjects follow the verb — 
an unusual, but perfectly fine position. If you follow the normal procedure (locating the verb
and asking who did the action), you find dogs, even though they appear last in the sentence.
s
incomplete. This statement contains a verb form, stopping, but no subject matches it. Verdict:
ten years in the grammar penitentiary for failure to complete the sentence.
t
They (S)/lapped (V). The action here is lapped, which unites nicely with they. Completeness
rules!
u
incomplete. The reader is waiting to hear something about the cow. The way the sentence
reads now, you have a description of cow — who used to work for NASA until she got fed up 
with the bureaucracy — but no action word to tell the reader what the cow is doing.
v
complete. The sentence tells you everything you need to know, so it’s complete.
w
complete. The question makes sense as is, so the sentence is complete.
x
incomplete. The statement gives you an idea — milking — and some descriptions but never
delivers with a complete thought about milking.
y
complete. Short, but you have everything you need to know about the protesting cow.
A
incomplete. The word because implies a cause-and-effect relationship, but the sentence 
doesn’t supply all the needed information.
B
incomplete. What did the mama cow do when she was only a calf? The sentence doesn’t actu-
ally say, so it’s incomplete.
C
incomplete. Not enough information appears in this sentence, which, by the way, also lacks a
subject/verb pair.
D
complete. All you need to know about moon-jumping (that it’s enough for any cow) is in the
sentence.
E
complete. This sentence contains enough information to reform NASA, should it indeed choose
to enter the field of moon-jumping.
F
incomplete. The sentence begins to make a statement about sheep but then veers off into a
description (which were once rejected from moon duty). No other thought is ever attached to
sheep, so the sentence is incomplete.
G
complete. This question makes sense as is. You may wonder what NASA will do, but you won’t
wonder what’s being asked here because the question — and the sentence — is complete.
H
incomplete. The first part of the sentence is a description, and the second is a qualifier,
explaining a condition (though female sheep produce milk). Neither of these two parts is a 
complete thought, so the sentence is incomplete.
I
complete. You have everything you need to know here except why anyone would want to send
sheep to the moon. Grammatically, this is a complete thought.

Chapter 4: Finishing What You Start: Writing Complete Sentences
J
complete. The statement comparing sheep performance to cow performance is finished, and
the cows win. You’re not left hanging, wondering what the sentence is trying to say. Verdict:
complete.
K
incorrect. Here you have two complete thoughts (everything before the comma equals one
complete thought; everything after the comma = another complete thought). A comma isn’t
strong enough to hold them together. Try a semicolon or insert and after the comma.
L
correct. No problems here! The extra information about the nickname (which had been given 
to him by the court clerks) is a description, not a complete thought, so it can be tucked into the
sentence next to the word it describes (nickname). The which ties the idea to nickname.
M
correct. Surprised? The nevertheless in this sentence is not used as a joiner, so it’s legal.
N
correct. Did I get you on this one? The word for has another, more common grammatical use 
in such expressions as for the love of Pete, for you, for the last time, and so on. However, for is 
a perfectly fine joiner of two complete thoughts when it means “because.”
O
correct. The semicolon here joins two complete thoughts correctly.
P
incorrect. To connect these two ideas, look for a stronger connection word. Then can’t do the
job. Try and then or but then. Still another good solution is to replace the comma with a semi-
colon (; then).
Q
correct. The words although and if join thoughts to another, more important, main idea about
Kathy’s sanity.
R
correct. The tacked-on description (which appeal to something in her character) is legal because
the which refers to the preceding word (fragments).
S
incorrect. Just because you’re quoting, don’t think you can ignore run-on rules. The quotation
itself contains two complete thoughts and thus needs to be expressed in two complete sen-
tences. Easiest fix: Place a period after exclaimed.
T
correct. No grammatical felonies here: Two ideas (she is free and Kathy intends to burn grammar
textbooks for fuel) are linked by while.
U
incorrect. Nevertheless is a long word. It looks strong enough to join two complete thoughts,
but in reality it isn’t. Plop a semicolon before nevertheless and you’re legal.
V
incorrect. One complete thought (History books create a satisfactory snap and crackle while they
are burning) is glued to another (the flames are also a nice shade of orange) with nothing more
than a comma. Penalty box! Use a semicolon or add a comma after burning, followed by the
conjunction and.
W
incorrect. As in the preceding question, one complete thought (Because she loves history, Kathy
rejected The Complete History of the Grammatical World) and another (she burned Participles
and You instead) are attached by a comma. I don’t think so! Use a semicolon or place a but after
World.
X
incorrect. Therefore isn’t a legal joiner. Substitute so or place a semicolon before therefore.
Y
correct. The word but is short, but it does the job of joining two complete sentences without
even working up a sweat.
z
. (period). Because this sentence makes a statement, a period is the appropriate endmark.

Dear Alissa,
Your smile, with its capped teeth and strikingly attractive knotty pine 
denture. I can think of nothing I would rather do than contemplate the gap 
between your molars. Inspired by your eyebrows, I think of stars, 
constellations, and furry little bears. In the future, when I will have the 
time to write poetry about those brows. Your nose alone merits a 
poem, a sonnet should be dedicated to its nostrils. A wrestler would be 
proud to have a neck such as yours. Your shoulders slope invitingly, 
moreover, your hips swivel better than my office chair. Across those 
noble shoulders slides your hair, as thick as extra-strength glue. How can 
I forget your eyes I am yours forever, Alissa, unless I get distracted by a 
better offer.

n my hometown, it’s possible to find stores where signs
proclaim “merchant’s sell Bagels.” You have to give me
a minute to shudder at the small but important mistakes
(and I don’t mean mistake’s) in bagel signage. First of all,
the apostrophe (the little hook at the end of the word 
merchant) is wrong, as are, in my informal count, 99.99 per-
cent of the apostrophes I see in all sorts of official spots.
Plus, despite the fact that bagels are extremely delicious,
they don’t deserve a capital letter. Sigh. Such are the daily
trials of a grammarian in New York City.
Wherever you live, in this part, you can practice 
some aspects of what grammarians call mechanics —
punctuation and capitalization. When you’re done, you’ll
be the master of the dreaded comma (Chapter 5), apostro-
phe (Chapter 7), and the quotation mark (Chapter 8). Plus,
you’ll know how to place hyphens and dashes and semi-
colons, not to mention colons (Chapter 6). Tucked into
Chapter 9 are the basics of capitalization. If all these
details fry your brain, feel free to refresh yourself with

 Punctuating lists correctly
 Signaling a direct address
 Placing commas in dates and addresses
 Using commas to insert introductory words and interrupters
 Deciding when descriptions need to be set off by commas
T
he well-dressed writing of a hundred years ago boasted far more commas than today’s
fashionable sentences. The current trend toward what grammarians term open style
punctuation calls for commas to be used sparingly. Dwindling though they may be, these
little punctuation marks have their place — in lists, direct address, dates and addresses,
introductory expressions, interrupters, and certain types of descriptions. In this chapter
you can practice inserting and deleting commas until your writing is as proper as a maiden
aunt and as stylish as a supermodel.
Making a List and Checking It Twice
When you’re writing a free-standing list, line breaks signal when one item in a list ends and
another begins. Commas do the same thing in sentences. Perhaps Professor MacGregor
wants you to do the following:
 Go on the Internet.
 Locate the origin of the handheld meat patty.
 Write a paper on hamburger history.
Inserted into a sentence, the line breaks in the preceding list turn into commas:
Professor MacGregor wants you to go on the Internet, locate the origin of the handheld
meat patty, and write a paper on hamburger history.
Notice that the first item isn’t preceded by a comma and that the last two items are sepa-
rated by and, which has a comma in front of it. Although that last comma is optional, many
style manuals, which are stricter than the bouncer at this year’s most popular club, want
you to insert a comma before the and or whatever word joins the last two items of the list.

If any item in a list has a comma within it, semicolons are used to separate the list
items. Imagine that you’re inserting this list into a sentence:
 Peter McKinney, the mayor
 Agnes Hutton
 Jeannie Battle, magic expert
In a sentence using only commas, the reader wouldn’t know that Peter McKinney is
the mayor and may instead think that Peter and the mayor are two separate people.
Here’s the properly punctuated sentence:
Because he has only one extra ticket to the magic expo, Daniel will invite Peter
McKinney, the mayor; Agnes Hutton; or Jeannie Battle, magic expert.
Get to work! Insert the list from each question into a sentence (I supply the begin-
ning), and punctuate it properly.

You Talkin’ to Me? Direct Address
If the name or title of the person to whom you’re talking or writing is inserted into the
sentence, you’re in a direct-address situation. Direct-address expressions are set off
from everything else by commas. In these examples, Wilfred is being addressed:
Wilfred, you can have the squash court at 10 a.m.
I expect you to remove all the seeds from the squash, Wilfred.
When you hit a zucchini, Wilfred, avoid using too much force.
The most common direct-address mistake is to send one comma to do a two-comma
job. In the last of the three preceding examples, two commas must set off Wilfred.
Can you insert commas to highlight the direct-address name in these sentences?
Q. Listen Champ I think you need to get a new pair of boxing gloves.
A. Listen, Champ, I think you need to get a new pair of boxing gloves. In this example,
you’re talking to Champ, a title that’s substituting for the actual name. Direct-address
expressions don’t have to be proper names, though they frequently are.

9. Really? Man I can’t believe you knew that!

Dating and Addressing
No, this section doesn’t tell you what to wear when taking a comma to dinner and a
movie. Nor does this section deal with what sort of speech you need to make when
you first meet a comma. Instead, this section enables you to practice placing commas
in dates (as in July 20, 2009) and addresses (as in Boise, Idaho).
The date rules are fairly simple:
 For a date that includes (in order) the month, day, and year, place a comma
after the day. If this kind of date is in a sentence that continues beyond the year,
place a comma after the year. (“I plan to blow up the rutabaga patch on August 4,
2006, unless I find a more enticing vegetable.”)
 For a date that includes (in order) the day, month, and year, open-style punctu-
ation, which drops commas faster than Superman drops Kryptonite, favors no
commas anywhere — before, after, inside, over, or under. You get the idea; no
commas. (“The last rutabaga will be harvested on 4 August 2006 and sold at auc-
tion.”) Some very traditional English teachers (I’m one) always place a comma
after the month and after the year, unless the year ends the sentence, in which
case the endmark follows the year. (“The last cabbage will be picked on 30
September, 2008, and made into a doll.”) If you’re writing for a particular person
(a professor or a boss), you should check his or her preference. As always, what-
ever style you choose should be consistent throughout.
 For a date that includes (in order) only the month and day, you don’t need any
commas. (“In honor of farmer Bill, I will send a contribution to Save the Rutabaga
on September 12.”)
 For a date that includes (in order) the month and year, no commas are
required. (“Bill bought the farm in January 2006 and sold it five years later.”)
70
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

Traditional punctuation places a comma between the month and the year and
after the year within a sentence; however, open-style punctuation favors fewer
commas, and that’s what I’m advocating. Many style manuals drop both commas
if the sentence continues. Which style should you follow? Your call, unless the
Authority Figure for whom you’re writing has a preference. No matter what you
do, be consistent.
As far as addresses are concerned, the following rules apply:
 If you’re writing an address in block form (not in a sentence), use a comma to
separate only the city from the state.
 If the address is inserted into a sentence, use a comma to show where one line
of the address ends and the next begins and between the city and state, which is
standard practice. If the sentence continues after the address, insert a comma
after the last bit of the address. (“I sent the rutabagas to Evelyn O’Hara, 1322
Wilson Street, Corville, Iowa 70202, but she never replied.”) Note: No comma is
placed between the state and the ZIP code.
Punctuation party time! Place commas where you need them in these sentences.
Q. On December 12 2007 I received a letter from Evelyn O’Hara, who now resides at 722 Park
Avenue New York City New York 10027 in the heart of Manhattan’s Upper East Side.
A. On December 12, 2007, I received a letter from Evelyn O’Hara, who now resides at 722
Park Avenue, New York City, New York 10027, in the heart of Manhattan’s Upper East
Side. Commas separate the day from the year, the whole date from the rest of the sen-
tence, and each part of the address (the house number and street, city, and state). A
comma also follows the address. Notice that no comma ever comes between the state and
the ZIP code. (They’ve been going steady for years and allow nothing to come between
them. Ah, love.)
16. An article in The New York Times of 12 November 2006 reports that rutabagas have very
few calories.
17. Evelyn is partial to the rutabagas sold by Clearview Nurseries 17 Fort Benn Parkway
Kalama Florida 05789 although they are quite expensive and its rates are going up in
September 2007.
18. Her last will and testament is dated April 8 1990 and specifies that rutabaga roses be
placed on her grave.
19. Her attorney, Hubert Wilberforce, may be contacted at 78 Crescent Square London
Connecticut 86689 for more information.
20. Instead of flowers, Evelyn wrote that friends and loved ones should contribute to the
United Rutabaga Society 990 Pacific Street Northwest Agonis Oregon 98989.
Introducing (and Interrupting) 
with the Comma
Do you want to start your sentences off with a bang, or at least a small pop? Fine. 
Just don’t forget to set off the introductory expression with a comma. Grammatically,
introductory expressions are a mixed bag of verbals, prepositional phrases, adverbial
71
Chapter 5: Exercising Comma Sense

clauses, and lots of other things you don’t have to know the names of. In short, an
introductory expression makes a comment on the rest of the sentence or adds a bit of
extra information. It may include a verb form or just mention a place; it may even be
as short as yes, no, or well; or it may be much longer. Check out the italicized portion
of each of these sentences for examples of introductory expressions:
Snaking through the dark tunnel, Brad Jones thought about the book deal he’d get
for his memoirs.
To get out in one piece, Brad planned a diversion.
While he was crossing the lighted area, an order of takeout pizza would be 
delivered.
Interrupters vary in length. A direct-address element (see the “You Talkin’ to Me? Direct
Address” section earlier in this chapter) may be considered a type of interrupter and so
may some of the introductory expressions in the preceding samples, even when you
move the introducers to the middle of the sentence. The same principle that applies to
direct-address elements applies to interrupters: They comment on or otherwise inter-
rupt the main idea of the sentence and thus are set off by commas. In these sentences,
the interrupters are italicized:
Cindy Jones, snaking through the dark tunnel, didn’t think about the book deal
she’d get for her memoirs.
There was no guarantee, of course, that Cindy would even be asked to write about
herself.
Some short introductory expressions or interrupters don’t require commas. For
example, in the sentence “In the morning Brad drank 12 cups of coffee,” in the morn-
ing isn’t set off by a comma. If the expression doesn’t have a verb in it and is tied
strongly to the main idea of the sentence, you can sometimes get away without
commas. This test may help: Say the sentence aloud (or in your head, if you’re afraid
of attracting the wrong sort of attention). If you hear a natural pause, plop in a
comma. If everything runs together nicely, don’t plop.
Up for some practice? Insert commas where needed and resist the temptation to
insert them where they’re not wanted in these sentences.
Q. Disgruntled after a long day delivering pizza Elsie was in no mood for fireworks.
A. Disgruntled after a long day delivering pizza, Elsie was in no mood for fireworks. The
comma sets off the introductory expression, Disgruntled after a long day delivering pizza.
Notice how all that applies to Elsie? She’s the subject of the sentence.
21. In desperate need of a pizza fix Brad turned to his cellphone.
22. Cindy on the other hand checked the phone number in the pizza directory she had
thoughtfully stashed in her purse.
23. Yes pizza was an excellent idea.
24. The toppings unfortunately proved to be a problem.
25. Restlessly Brad pondered pepperoni as the robbers searched for him.
72

26. Cindy wondered how Brad given his low-fat diet could consider pepperoni.
27. Frozen with indecision Brad decided to call the supermarket to request the cheapest
brand.
28. Cindy of course wanted to redeem her coupons.
29. To ensure fast delivery was crucial.
30. Lighting a match and holding it near his trembling hand Brad realized that time was

31. Worrying about toppings had used up too many minutes.
32. Well the robbers would have a good story to tell.
33. With renewed determination Cindy speed-dialed the market and offered “a really big tip”
for ten-minute service.
34. As the robbers chomped on pepperoni and argued about payment Brad slipped away.
35. Cindy let’s just say was left to clean up the mess.
Setting Off Descriptions
Life would be much simpler for the comma-inserter if nobody ever described any-
thing. No descriptions would mean no comma problems. However, solving your punc-
tuation problems in that way leads to writing that resembles a pay-by-the-word text
message — limited in scope, expensive, and not a good idea!
A better plan is to find out more about these basic principles behind punctuating
descriptive expressions:
 If the description follows the word being described, decide whether it’s extra
information or essential, identifying material. If the description falls into the
“nice to know but I didn’t really need it” (extra) category, surround it with
commas. If the description is in the “gotta have it” bin, omit the commas. For
example, in the sentence, “The dictionary on the table is dusty,” the description
in italics is necessary because it tells which dictionary is dusty. However, in the
sentence, “Charlie’s dictionary, which is on the table, is dusty,” the description in
italics is set off by commas, because you already know Charlie’s dictionary is the
one being discussed. The part about the table is extra information.
 For descriptions that precede the word described, place commas only when
you have a list of two or more descriptions of the same type and importance.
You can you tell when two or more descriptions are equally important; they can
be written in different order without changing the meaning of the sentence. For
example, in the sentence, “The tan, dusty dictionary has never been opened,” the
two descriptions — tan and dusty — can be reversed without changing the mean-
ing, so you need a comma. However, in the sentence, “Two dusty dictionaries
need some cleaning power now!” the two descriptions aren’t the same type —
one is a number, and one is a condition. You can’t say, Dusty two, so you don’t
insert commas.
73
Chapter 5: Exercising Comma Sense

 When descriptions containing verb forms introduce a sentence (see the pre-
ceding section on introductory elements), they always are set off by commas.
An example: Sighing into his handkerchief, Charlie looked for a dust cloth. The
description, sighing into his handkerchief, has a verb form (sighing) and thus is
set off by a comma from the rest of the sentence.
Got the idea? Now try your comma skills on the following sentence. If the italicized
words need to be set off, add the commas. If not, go waterskiing. (Just kidding. Leave
the sentence alone if no commas are needed.)
Q. The ruffled striped blouse belongs to my oldest sister Mary.
A. The ruffled, striped blouse belongs to my oldest sister, Mary. The first two descriptions
precede the word being described (blouse) and may be interchanged without a problem,
so a comma is needed between them. The second description (which, the strictest gram-
marians would tell you is really an equivalent term or appositive) follows the word
described (my oldest sister). Because you can have only one oldest sister, the name is
extra, not essential identifying information, and it’s set off by commas.
36. Oscar’s favorite food which he cooks every Saturday night is hot dogs.
37. The place where he feels most comfortable during the cooking process is his huge brick 
barbecue.
38. Oscar stores his wheat buns in a large plastic tub.
39. One of the horses that live in Oscar’s barn often sniffs around the horseshoe.
40. Oscar rode his three favorite horses in an important race honoring the Barbecue King and

Rob will consider his party a success if he can get three phone numbers, arrange at least
one future date, and avoid police interference. Fortunately, Rob’s standards of success are
fairly low. So is the standard for a correctly punctuated list. All you have to do is plop a comma
between each item.

item from another. Why? The first item on the list has commas in it, so a plain comma isn’t
enough to separate the list items.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I present the Fifth Annual Elbox Championships. Even though Ladies
and Gentlemen doesn’t name the members of the audience, they’re still being addressed, so a
comma sets off the expression from the rest of the sentence.
g
I know, Mort, that you are an undefeated Elbox competitor. Would you tell our audience
about the sport? Here you see the benefit of the direct-address comma. Without it, the reader
thinks I know Mort is the beginning of the sentence and then lapses into confusion. Mort is cut
away with two commas, and the reader understands that I know that you are . . . is the real
meaning.
h
Elboxing is about 5,000 years old, Chester. It originated in ancient Egypt. You’re talking to
Chester, so his name needs to be set off with a comma.
i
Really? Man, I can’t believe you knew that! Before you start yelling at me, I know that Man is
sometimes simply an exclamation of feeling, not a true address. But it can be, and in this sen-
tence, it is. Hence the comma slices it away from the rest of the sentence.
j
Yes, the sport grew out of the natural movement of the elbow when someone tried to inter-
fere with a diner’s portion by “elbowing,” Chester. No one’s hitting Chester’s funny bone.
Instead, Chester is being addressed directly, so you need the comma.
k
Excuse me a moment. The reigning champion has decided to pay us a visit. Miss William,
could you tell us how you feel about the upcoming match? Here the person being addressed
is Miss William.
l
Certainly, Sir. I am confident that my new training routine will pay off. The very polite Miss
William from the previous exercise talks to Sir in this sentence, so that term is set off by a
comma.

m
What type of exercises did you do, Placida? I may call you “Placida,” right? Placida is being
addressed, so the name requires a comma. Also, as reigning champ, she requires a bowl of jelly
beans with the green ones removed. It’s in her contract.
n
Sure! I arm-wrestled for eight hours a day, Mort, and then swam a mile or so for the aerobic
benefit. The direct address term Mort is in the middle of the sentence, so two commas are
needed to cut it away from the main idea.
o
We wish her the best of luck, don’t we, folks? In this sentence, folks are being addressed, so
the term must be set off by a comma.

An article in The New York Times of 12 November 2006 reports that rutabagas have very
few calories. Or, An article in The New York Times of 12 November, 2006, reports that
rutabagas have very few calories. Surprise! Two answers are possible. The more modern 
solution calls for no commas. The very traditional, “I learned English when quill pens were 
the rage” style calls for commas between the month and year and the year and the rest of the
sentence.
q
Evelyn is partial to the rutabagas sold by Clearview Nurseries, 17 Fort Benn Parkway,
Kalama, Florida 05789, although they are quite expensive, and its rates are going up in
September 2007. Each line of the address is separated from the next by a comma. A comma
also follows the address. The last date doesn’t need a comma, but you may place one between
the month and the year if you wish to follow the older, traditional style.
r
Her last will and testament is dated April 8, 1990, and specifies that rutabaga roses be
placed on her grave. Traditional month-day-year style dates take commas between the day 
and the year and also after the year within a sentence.
s
Her attorney, Hubert Wilberforce, may be contacted at 78 Crescent Square, London,
Connecticut 86689, for more information. The lines of Hubert’s address are separated by
commas, and the whole thing is followed by a comma. No comma ever appears between the
state and the ZIP code.
t
Instead of flowers, Evelyn wrote that friends and loved ones should contribute to the United
Rutabaga Society, 990 Pacific Street Northwest, Agonis, Oregon 98989. Did the Northwest
throw you? I made it part of the street line, so it doesn’t need to be set off by a comma from
Pacific Street. If you interpreted the location as Northwest Agonis, no problem. In that case the
comma follows Street. (Neither Agonis nor Northwest Agonis exists, so I don’t care which you
choose. In real life, of course, you have to use the proper address.)
u
In desperate need of a pizza fix, Brad turned to his cellphone. The introductory expression
here merits a comma because it’s fairly long. Length doesn’t always determine whether you
need a comma, but in general the longer the introduction, the more likely you’ll need a comma.
v
Cindy, on the other hand, checked the phone number in the pizza directory she had
thoughtfully stashed in her purse. The expression inside the commas makes a comment on 
the rest of the sentence, contrasting it with the actions of Brad. As an interrupter, it must be
separated by commas from the rest of the sentence.
w
Yes, pizza was an excellent idea. Yes and no, when they show up at the beginning of a sen-
tence, take commas if they comment on the main idea.
x
The toppings, unfortunately, proved to be a problem. The unfortunately is short and closely
tied to the meaning of the sentence. However, setting the word off with commas emphasizes the
emotional, judgmental tone. I’ve gone with the commas, as you see, but I can accept a case for
omitting them.

Restlessly Brad pondered the pepperoni question as the robbers searched for him. The
introductory word restlessly is short and clear. No comma is necessary.
A
Cindy wondered how Brad, given his low-fat diet, could consider pepperoni. The expression
given his low-fat diet interrupts the flow of the sentence and calls for commas.
B
Frozen with indecision, Brad decided to call the supermarket to request the cheapest brand.
Introductory expressions with verb forms always take commas.
C
Cindy, of course, wanted to redeem her coupons. The of course interrupts the flow of the sen-
tence and comments on the main idea. Hence the commas.
D
To ensure fast delivery was crucial. Did I catch you here? This sentence doesn’t have an intro-
ductory expression. To ensure fast delivery is the subject of the sentence, not an extra comment.
E
Lighting a match and holding it near his trembling hand, Brad realized that time was almost
up. Introductory expressions containing verbs always take commas. This introductory expres-
sion has two verbs, lighting and holding.
F
Worrying about toppings had used up too many minutes. This sentence has no introductory
expression, so no comma is needed. The verb form (Worrying about toppings) is the subject of
the sentence, not an introduction to another idea.
G
Well, the robbers would have a good story to tell. Words such as well, indeed, clearly, and so
forth take commas when they occur at the beginning of the sentence and aren’t part of the
main idea.
H
With renewed determination, Cindy speed-dialed the market and offered “a really big tip”
for ten-minute service. I admit that this one’s a judgment call. If you didn’t place a comma after
determination, I won’t prosecute you for comma fraud. Neither will I scream if you, like me,
inserted one. This sentence falls into a gray area. With a comma, the introductory expression
stands out a little more. Your call.
I
As the robbers chomped on pepperoni and argued about payment, Brad slipped away. This
introductory expression has a subject and a verb and clearly needs a comma.
J
Cindy, let’s just say, was left to clean up the mess. This sentence is another that couldn’t pos-
sibly make sense without the commas. Cindy isn’t attached to the interrupter, let’s just say, but
absent the commas, the reader runs all those words together. Penalty box! You have to add the
commas.
K
Oscar’s favorite food, which he cooks every Saturday night, is hot dogs. After you find out
that the food is Oscar’s favorite, you have enough identification. The information about Oscar’s
datefree Saturday nights is extra and thus set off by commas. Descriptions beginning with
which are usually extra.
L
The place where he feels most comfortable during the cooking process is his huge brick
barbecue. The term place is quite general, so the description is an essential identifier. The two
descriptions preceding barbecue aren’t of the same type. One gives size and the other composi-
tion. You can’t easily reverse them (a brick huge barbecue sounds funny), so don’t insert a
comma.
M
Oscar stores his wheat buns in a large plastic tub. The paired descriptions (his and wheat,
large and plastic) aren’t of the same type. His is a possessive, and you should never set off a
possessive with a comma. (They get very annoyed. Don’t ask!) Large indicates size and plastic,
composition.

79
Chapter 5: Exercising Comma Sense
N
One of the horses that live in Oscar’s barn often sniffs around the tub. Which horses are
you talking about? Without the barn information, you don’t know. Identifying information 
doesn’t take commas. Hint: Descriptions beginning with that are nearly always essential 
identifiers and thus aren’t set off by commas.
O
Oscar rode his three favorite horses in an important race honoring the Barbecue King and
Queen. The three descriptions preceding horses aren’t of the same type: One (his) is posses-
sive, and another (three) is a number. Commas never set off possessives and numbers. The
second descriptive element explains which race you’re talking about. Without that information,
the topic could be any important race. As an identifier, it isn’t set off by a comma.
P
Oscar will never sell one of his horses because he needs money. Without a comma the itali-
cized information is essential to the meaning of the sentence. The comma-free sentence means
that Oscar may sell a horse because he hates the animal or wants to please the prospective
buyer, but never for financial reasons. (Perhaps he bought into Microsoft early on or won the
lottery.) With a comma, the italicized material is extra. The sentence then means that Oscar will
never sell a horse, period. The reason — he needs the money — may mean that the horses are
worth more in Oscar’s stable than they would be anywhere else. The first interpretation makes
more sense, so don’t drop in a comma.
Q
Oscar dedicated a song to the filly that was born on his birthday. Which filly? You don’t
know without the italicized identification. Thus you need no comma.
R
The jockeys became annoyed by Oscar’s song, which he played constantly. Even without the
italicized material, you know which song the jockeys hate. The italicized material gives you a
little more info, but nothing essential.
S
The deep, horrible secret is that Oscar can’t carry a tune. These two descriptions may be
reversed without loss of meaning, so a comma is appropriate.
T
His guitar, a Gibson, is missing a few important strings also. The his tells you which guitar is
being discussed, so the fact that it’s a Gibson is extra and should be set off by commas.
Annual Self-Evaluation: Kristin DeMint
Well, Ms. Ehrlich, that time of year has arrived again. I, must think about 
my strengths and weaknesses as an employee, of Toe-Ring International. 
First and most important, let me say that I love working for Toe-Ring. 
When I applied for the job on September 15, 2005, I never dreamed how 
much fun I would have taking two, long lunches a day. Sneaking out the 
back door, is not my idea of fun. Because no one ever watches what I am 
doing at Toe-Ring, I can leave by the front door without worrying. Also, Ms. 
Ehrlich, I confess that I do almost no work at all. Transferred to the plant in 
Boise, Idaho, I immediately claimed a privilege given only to the most 
experienced, most skilled, employees and started to take an extra week of 
vacation. I have only one more thing to say. May I have a raise?

Commas surround Ms. Ehrlich because she’s being directly addressed in this sentence.
V
See the preceding answer.
W
The pronoun I is part of the main idea of the sentence, not an introductory expression. No
comma should separate it from the rest of the sentence.
X
The phrase of Toe-Ring International is an essential identifier of the type of employee being dis-
cussed. No comma should separate it from the word it describes (employee).
Y
A comma follows the introductory expression, First and most important.
z
In this date, a comma separates the day from the year.
Z
A comma follows a year when a date is inserted into a sentence.
1
Two descriptions are attached to lunches — two and long. These descriptions aren’t of the same
type. Two is a number, and long is a different sort of quantity. Also, numbers are never sepa-
rated from other descriptions by a comma. The verdict: Delete the comma after two.
2
In this sentence the expression sneaking out the back door isn’t an introductory element. It’s the
subject of the sentence, and it shouldn’t be separated from its verb (is) by a comma.
3
The introductory expression Because no one ever watches what I am doing at Toe-Ring should
be separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
4
Also is an introduction to the sentence. Slice it off with a comma.
5
A comma separates the city from the state.
6
A comma follows Idaho for two reasons. If an address is embedded in a sentence, a comma gen-
erally follows the last bit of the address — in this case, the state. Also, Idaho is the last bit of an
introductory element.
7
Two descriptions are attached to employees: most experienced and most skilled. Because these
descriptions are more or less interchangeable, a comma separates them from each other.
8
No comma ever separates the last description from what it describes, so the comma before
employees has to go.

Made You Look! Punctuation 
Marks That Demand Attention
In This Chapter
 Placing hyphens where needed
 Using dashes for drama and interruptions
 Examining colons and semicolons
T
he punctuation marks I discuss in this chapter don’t sit in the corner at parties murmur-
ing, “Just forget about me.” Instead, they scream, “I’m important! Pay attention, NOW,”
wherever they appear. Happily, placing these marks in the proper spots is a cinch.
Connectors and Dividers: Hyphens
Hyphens (-) are the shortest horizontal marks in the punctuation world. (Dashes are the
long ones.) Sometimes, hyphens function as word breakers. When you arrive at the right-
hand margin in the middle of a word, a hyphen enables you to finish the word on the next
line. Just break the word at the end of a syllable (the dictionary guides you on this point),
but don’t leave only one or two letters all by themselves, and don’t attempt to divide any
one-syllable words, even a long one such as through (if you’re working on a computer, though,
you can count on your word processing program to take care of end-of-line hyphenation 
for you).
Hyphens also create compounds (two words linked to create one meaning) and sometimes
to attach a prefix to a word. Prefixes (pre-, post-, ante-, un-, and so on) grab onto the front of
other words, thereby changing the meaning. Most prefixes attach without hyphens, but a
couple (self-, for example) tend to appear with hyphens.
As with other punctuation marks, the hyphen is subject to fashion. Many prefixed and
hyphenated compounds of a hundred years ago have now become single words. What used
to be non-negotiable is nonnegotiable these days. To make matters worse, the major style
guides and publishing companies sometimes differ on the to-hyphenate-or-not question.
The dictionary is a good guide for the everyday writer who’s unsure about a particular case.
If you can’t find a dictionary, follow these guidelines:
 You need a hyphen if your reader will become confused without one. You may, for
example, be going to re-create a work of art or recreate at your local amusement park.
Without the hyphen, how can the reader tell?
 If two vowels show up together, chances are you need a hyphen. Anti-insurance and
re-examine, for example, need hyphens.

 If a prefix latches onto a capitalized word, a hyphen separates the two. Consider
anti-Republican and post-Renaissance.
 If you’re talking about part of a word (as I did earlier in this section when I
listed the prefixes pre-, post-, and others), a hyphen signals that the word isn’t
complete. The hyphen functions in this way when you want to link two prefixes
to one root word, as in the expression pre- and postwar anxiety.
Hyphens also link two words that form one description of the same person or thing.
You may make a third-base error (one bungled play) and allow a run to score. Or, if
you’re having a really bad day, you may make a third base-error (the third of three bad
throws to any base, made obvious by the creation of compound base-error). The
hyphen brings clarity, though it can’t improve your baseball skills.
Enough talk. Time for some action. Use a caret (^) to tuck a hyphen wherever it’s
needed in this sentence. If you find a misplaced hyphen, cross it out with a vertical
slash. If the sentence is okay, go bowling.
Q. The best known actress of the preSpielberg era has recently begun to respond to fans 
via email.
A. best-known, pre-Spielberg, e-mail. Both best and known describe actress, so the descrip-
tions are hyphenated. The pre- is attached to a capitalized word; hence the hyphen. The
current spelling of e-mail includes a hyphen. Ten years from now, however, you may be
sending email . . . or teleporting, for all I know.
1. Jim, the second string quarterback, hates mice.
2. Among the antirodent forces was Megan, who doesn’t like glue-traps.
3. Megan prefers a short preexecution period.
4. As a matter of fact, Megan is profoundly antiPestbegone, a new product that traps mice in
a sticky web.
5. Debbie is too wrapped up in a selfimprovement program to worry about pests.
6. In Debbie’s opinion, the supremely-annoying pest is Calvin, who insists on taking her
skiing this weekend.
7. Calvin is into both tele- and miscommunication.
8. A two or a three way telephone call is Calvin’s favorite way to arrange a ski-trip.
9. Tomorrow Megan, who is Latvian-American, will ask Calvin to take her skiing instead of
Debbie.
10. Megan wants to show off her extremely-expensive ski equipment.
Just Dashing Through
The dash is the egotist of punctuation marks. It calls your attention faster than a fire
drill in the middle of a test. Hence you need to use the dash sparingly, in these situa-
tions only:
82
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

 To interrupt the flow of thought with another idea. “I will not attend the ball —
how could I when my glass slipper is cracked? — no matter how much you beg.”
Notice that the material inserted into the sentence between the two dashes
doesn’t begin with a capital letter, even though in another situation it can stand
alone as a complete sentence.
 To summarize or define a list. “Lip gloss, bug repellent, stun gun — Megan had
everything she needed for her big date.” The dash divides the list from its defini-
tion, which is everything Megan thinks she needs on a date.
If you’re not feeling dramatic, use a colon to precede a list. A colon does the
same job grammatically, with less flash than the dash.
 To show incompleteness. “You don’t carry stun —” Megan was nearly speech-
less at the thought of a date without her trusty stun gun. The dash shows that
the sentence is incomplete.
 To create drama. “May I introduce the best golfer in Antarctica — Sam Spearly.”
The dash is the equivalent of a drumroll in this sentence. In the sample sentence,
“Sam Spearly” may be preceded by a comma, if you favor a quieter approach.
(See Chapter 5 for more information on commas.)
When you plop a dash into a sentence, don’t place a comma before or after it, unless
you’re showing incompleteness and the sentence requires a comma after the dash.
Dashes aren’t appropriate in some situations. Keep these points in mind:
 Too many dashes are really annoying to the reader.
 Dashes can’t be used to join complete sentences.
 You can’t send a dash to do a hyphen’s job.
Now dash through these questions, inserting dashes where appropriate. By the way,
did you notice that I didn’t say where needed? That’s because dashes aren’t required
anywhere. Other punctuation marks (colons or parentheses, for example) may substi-
tute for the dash, though they’re usually less dramatic. Note that you may have to
knock out another punctuation mark before inserting a dash.
Q. As usual Debbie brought too many snacks, chocolate antlers, cherry-coated sardines, and
unsalted popcorn.
A. As usual Debbie brought too many snacks — chocolate antlers, cherry-coated sardines,
and unsalted popcorn. The dash works better than the comma in this sentence, because
the comma after snacks blends in with the list.
11. Jim plans to attend the truck race, I really don’t know why, along with his personal trainer.
12. “I can scarcely believe that he has a trainer because . . .” sputtered Debbie.
13. He needs help with his fitness routine, four push-ups, a walk around the block, and a 20-
minute nap.
14. His personal trainer worked with one of the best athletes on the planet, Karen Green.
15. Push-ups and walking, not exactly demanding exercises, are so easy that even an old lady
can do them.
83
Chapter 6: Made You Look! Punctuation Marks That Demand Attention

Sorting Out Semicolons
A semicolon ( ; ) is the punctuation mark that people use to create winks in electronic
messages. Not surprisingly, that isn’t its main job. Instead, semicolons link two com-
plete sentences and separate items in a list when at least one of those items contains
a comma. (Chapter 5 tells you more about this function of the semicolon.) One impor-
tant note: Don’t join two sentences with a semicolon unless the ideas are closely
related.
Get to work. Insert or delete semicolons as required in Fran’s thoughts on a recent heat
wave. If no semicolons need to be added or deleted, write “correct” in the blank after
the sentence.
Q. Fran is allergic to hot weather, she plans to crank up her air conditioner to maximum cool.
_______________
A. Fran is allergic to hot weather; she plans to crank up her air conditioner to maximum
cool. The original sentence sends a comma to do a semicolon’s job. Not a good idea!

Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

Placing Colons
A colon (:) often shows up — to grammarians’ intense disapproval — in e-mails and
the like to create smiley faces and other emoticons. Its real job is to introduce a long
quotation or a list. Don’t place a colon after a form of the verb to be or a preposition
(from, by, to, and similar words). Also, in the absolute strictest English (and not even I
am that picky), a colon may introduce a list or a quotation only when the words
before the colon form a complete sentence. If you follow this rule, you can’t insert a
colon after for example, but you can use one after take a look at this example. Most
business and technical handbooks allow colons after introductory phrases.
Time to “colon-ize” (or not) the sentences in this section. Add or remove colons (and,
if necessary, subtract other punctuation). If everything’s okay, write “correct” in the
blank after the sentence.
Q. The weather this year may be described with these words, horrible, freezing, humid, and
windy. _______________
A. The weather this year may be described with these words: horrible, freezing, humid,
and windy. The list of weather descriptions doesn’t include words. Placing a comma after
words allows words to blend in with the list of descriptions. A colon marks the separation
between the introduction and the list.
26. As I watched the thermometer rise, I told my friend what I felt: “There should be a
national monument to the inventor of air-conditioning. If I had to live in the days when 
a bucket of ice and a fan were the only remedies for hot weather, I’d move to the North
Pole.” _______________

Answers to Punctuation Problems
a
second-string. You’re not talking about second quarterback and string quarterback. These two
words join forces to form one description of quarterback — one who isn’t on the starting team
but rather is on the second-string team.
b
glue traps. You don’t normally need a hyphen between the prefix anti and the word it’s glued
onto. The word glue describes traps and doesn’t form a compound.
c
pre-execution. Two vowels together, created by the attachment of a prefix, call for a hyphen.
d
anti-Pestbegone. The name of the product that Megan opposes is Pestbegone, which begins
with a capital letter. When you clap a prefix onto a capitalized word, a hyphen needs to sepa-
rate them.
e
self-improvement. The prefix self- likes to show up with a hyphen.
f
supremely annoying. These two words don’t form one description. Instead, supremely
describes annoying. How annoying? Supremely annoying. In general, descriptions ending in -ly
aren’t linked by a hyphen to other descriptions.
g
correct. The sentence links two prefixes to one word. The hyphen after the first prefix tells the
reader to attach it to communication.
h
two- or a three-way and ski trip. Calvin likes a two-way telephone call or a three-way telephone
call. The hyphen links the descriptions. Ski describes trip and doesn’t form a compound.
i
Latvian American or correct. Here hyphens enter the realm of politics. If you hyphenate the
term, you give equal importance to both, so Megan appreciates her Latvian and her American
heritage equally. If you don’t hyphenate, the second term dominates because it’s described by the
first. Without a hyphen, Megan sees herself as primarily American, though the Latvian side has
some influence. Which form should you use? It depends on your point of view, but be consistent.
j
extremely expensive. The first word describes the second. How expensive? Like everything
Megan buys, extremely expensive! They aren’t linked as one description, so no hyphen should
be inserted.
k
Jim plans to attend the truck race — I really don’t know why — along with his personal
trainer. The interrupting words I really don’t know why are set off by dashes. But just so you
know, parentheses can also do the job.
l
“I can scarcely believe that he has a trainer because —” sputtered Debbie. Or, correct. The
ellipses (three dots) in the question do the job perfectly well, but the dash is more dramatic.
Your call.
m
He needs help with his fitness routine — four push-ups, a walk around the block, and a 
20-minute nap. The comma doesn’t work after routine because otherwise the definition just
blends in and creates a list of four things: routine, push-ups, a walk, and a nap. If you’re allergic
to dashes, a colon or parentheses may substitute here.
n
His personal trainer worked with one of the best athletes on the planet — Karen Green. Or,
correct. Once again, if the comma is your preference, go for it.
o
Push-ups and walking — not exactly demanding exercises — are so easy even an old lady
can do them. A dash sets off a comment on push-ups and walking.
87
Chapter 6: Made You Look! Punctuation Marks That Demand Attention

p
The reasons why I hate the summer are sweat, sweat, and sweat. The items in this list are
single words, not phrases containing commas. Semicolons therefore aren’t needed to separate
the items in the list. Commas do the job.
q
They say global warming is a myth. I bought two watermelons today. A semicolon can’t join
two unrelated ideas. These random thoughts — Fran always talks this way — shouldn’t be linked
by a semicolon. Apart from punctuation, throwing two unrelated ideas together isn’t a good idea.
The reader should have a logical thread to follow between one sentence and another.
r
correct. Surprised? This list contains one item (Ross, Alaska) that includes a comma. If the three
places were separated only by commas, the reader would not be sure whether Ross and Alaska
were two items or one. The semicolon tells the reader where one item ends and another begins.
s
I will turn on the weather report, but I am sure that it will be sunny and mild. The word but
joins these two sentences, so you don’t need a semicolon too. Change it to a comma. A comma
precedes and, but, or, nor, and similar words when they connect two complete sentences.
t
My saltshaker will run freely again. I may buy a winter coat. The semicolon implies a rela-
tionship between the things it links. You can argue that the two halves of this sentence show
what Fran wants out of the cold front, but if the relationship isn’t immediately clear to the
reader, add some words or make two separate sentences. Better yet, add one or more sen-
tences that join the two ideas in a logical way.
u
Of course, winter coats are now on sale; the fact that winter doesn’t arrive for three more
months is irrelevant. These two complete thoughts both relate to the maddening habit of sell-
ing out-of-season merchandise. Because both statements are complete thoughts, a semicolon
joins them legally.
v
Stores like to sell merchandise in advance; shoppers prefer to buy season-appropriate
goods. Each of these two statements could stand alone as a complete sentence, and that’s why
they can’t be mashed together without a legal connection. You need a semicolon to link them.
w
Macy’s has a sale on boots with fur linings, cashmere scarves, and leather gloves. Take the
semicolons out of this list. You need a semicolon to separate items in a list only if one of the
items contains a comma — not the case here.
x
correct. In this sentence, two complete thoughts are correctly united by a semicolon.
y
July is quite cool in Sydney, Australia; Canberra, Australia; and Wellington, New Zealand. A
comma separates the city and state in each of the items on this list, so a semicolon is needed to
separate one item from another.
A
correct. This quotation from Fran is quite long and introduced by a complete sentence. Thus it
may be introduced by a colon.
B
Did I tell you that I bought books by Marv Heatfree, Helen Icicle, and October Surprise?
Don’t place a colon after the preposition by; just dive into the list.
C
When I return, I will say, “Great vacation.” The colon after say isn’t a good idea, because the
quotation is short and (I have to admit) run-of-the-mill. The colon is appropriate for long or
extremely dramatic quotations only.
D
The announcer will explain that a strong cold front has wiped out the humidity. Drop the
colon! It only interrupts the main idea, which shouldn’t be interrupted, particularly in the case
of cold fronts. (I’m writing this in mid-July, when everyone is sweating.) No punctuation is
needed after explain.
E
I am astonished — a great, heat-free day! If you want the punctuation equivalent of a drum-
roll, go for a dash, not a colon.
88
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

F
No punctuation needed here. Why? The sentence has no interrupting thought that should be
set off by a dash.
G
No punctuation needed here, because a colon should never follow a preposition (by, in this 
sentence).
H
Two complete sentences can’t be placed next to each other without a joining word or appropri-
ate punctuation. Insert a semicolon or make two separate sentences.
I
These two descriptions should not be linked because they don’t form a single description of
mansion. Instead, restored describes mansion and lovingly describes restored. In general, words
ending in -ly aren’t linked by hyphens to other descriptions.
J
The dash is out of place here because including introduces the list. Drop the dash. (I’d also
leave La Bocaville Resort on the first available jet, but maybe that’s just me.)
K
The hyphen is needed to join water and filled because they create one description of the bal-
loon and a very messy volleyball game.
L
The term secretary-treasurer is always hyphenated.
M
The two complete sentences are already joined by and. The semicolon is overkill. Drop the and,
or drop the semicolon.
N
The colon after Restaurant implies that a list or a quotation follows, but the next few words
don’t fit into those categories. A comma is better here.
O
Bug describes spray. No hyphen is needed, because you don’t have a compound word.
La Bocaville Resort welcomes — you to the best vacation of your life! 
When you arrive at the airport, you’ll be greeted by: a stretch limo and a 
driver, a complimentary box of chocolates, and a bottle of mosquito 
repellent. No need to hike 10 miles to LaBocaville; the limo will take you 
to the resort. After you’ve checked in to our lovingly- restored mansion, 
you can choose amoung many alternatives, including — volleyball 
played with a water-filled balloon and a chat with our secretary-treasurer, 
who is also our President of Having a Great Time! She’s dedicated to 
your vacation;, and she knows her job depends on your happiness with 
La Bocaville. You may also want to visit the BocaBite Restaurant:, 
conveniently located inside the pool area. Be sure to take bug- spray 
along.

One Small Mark, a Whole New
Meaning: Apostrophes
In This Chapter
 Shortening words and numbers with apostrophes
 Showing possession
A
n apostrophe is a little hook (’) that snags many writers at some point. With a little
practice, you can confidently plop apostrophes into the proper spots in your writing.
The most common apostrophe mistake is to place one where it’s not appropriate. Don’t use
an apostrophe in either of these circumstances:
 To create a plural: You have one arrow and two arrows, not two arrow’s. The 
no-apostrophe-for-plural rule holds true for names. I am one person named Woods, 
and members of my family are the Woodses, not the Woods’.
 With a possessive pronoun: Don’t use an apostrophe in a possessive pronoun (my,
your, his, hers, its, ours, theirs, whose, and so on).
Traditionally, an apostrophe was used to create a particular (and unusual) type of plural —
the plural of symbols and numerals. It was also used to create the plural of a word referred
to as a word. (Confused? Keep reading for an example.) In old books you may find a sen-
tence like Henry sprinkled 20’s and therefore’s throughout his story. Don’t panic. Grammar
goes through changes. What was once correct is now passé. Just recognize an outdated
custom and move on with your life.
Hook into the exercises in this chapter so that no apostrophe snags you ever again.
Putting Words on a Diet: Contractions
Apostrophes shorten words by replacing one or more letters. The shortened word, or con-
traction (not to be confused with the thing pregnant women scream through), adds an infor-
mal, conversational tone to your writing.
The most frequently used contractions, paired with their long forms, include those in 
Table 7-1.

College entrance tests won’t ask you to insert an apostrophe into a word, but they may want to
know whether you can spot a misplaced mark or an improperly expanded contraction. An apos-
trophe shortens a word, and a common mistake is to re-expand a contraction into something 
it was never meant to be. The contraction should’ve, for example, is short for should have, not
should of. The expressions should of, could of, and would of don’t exist in standard English. If you
see one of these turkeys on the SAT or the ACT, you know you’ve found a mistake.
Contractions aren’t just for words. You also can slice numbers out of your writing with 
apostrophes, especially in informal circumstances. This punctuation mark enables you to
graduate in ’07, marry in ’15, and check the maternity coverage in your health insurance
policy by early ’18.
Feel like flexing your apostrophe muscles? Look at the underlined words in these sentences
and change them into contractions. Place your answers in the blanks.

Taking Possession
The pen of my aunt that you learn in foreign-language class becomes my aunt’s pen in 
standard English, with the help of an apostrophe. To show possession with apostrophes, 
keep these rules in mind:
 Singular owner: Attach an apostrophe and the letter s (in that order) to a singular
person, place, or thing to express possession (Henry’s tooth, Rome’s dentists, the 
drill’s annoying whine).
 Plural owner: Attach an apostrophe to a regular plural (one that ends in s) to express
possession (the boys’ restroom, the cities’ mayors, the billboards’ message).
 Irregular plural owner: Add an apostrophe and the letter s (in that order) to an irregular
plural (one that doesn’t end in s) to express possession (the children’s toys, the data’s
significance).
 Joint ownership: If two or more people own something jointly, add an apostrophe and 
an s (in that order) to the last name (Abe and Mary’s sofa; George, Jeb, and Barbara’s
memories).
93
Chapter 7: One Small Mark, a Whole New Meaning: Apostrophes

 Separate ownership: If two or more people own things separately, everyone gets an
apostrophe and an s (Abe’s and Mary’s pajamas; George’s, Jeb’s, and Barbara’s shoes).
 Hyphenated owner: If the word you’re working with is hyphenated, just attach the 
apostrophe and s to the end (mother-in-law’s office). For plurals ending in s, attach the
apostrophe only (three secretary-treasurers’ accounts).
 Time and money: Okay, Father Time and Mr. Dollar Bill don’t own anything. Nevertheless,
time and money may be possessive in expressions such as next week’s test, two hours’
homework, a day’s pay, and so forth. Follow the rules for singular and plural owners, as
explained at the beginning of this bulleted list.

Chapter 7: One Small Mark, a Whole New Meaning: Apostrophes

Answers to Apostrophe Problems
a
aren’t. The contraction drops the letter o and substitutes an apostrophe.
b
I’m, you’ll. In the first contraction, the apostrophe replaces the letter a. In the second, it
replaces two letters, w and i.
c
won’t. This contraction is irregular because you can’t make an apostrophe-letter swap. Illogical
though it may seem, won’t is the contraction of will not.
d
Don’t. Drop the space between the two words, eliminate the o, and insert an apostrophe to
create don’t.
e
you’re, don’t. The first contraction sounds exactly like the possessive pronoun your. Don’t 
confuse the two.
f
would’ve, wouldn’t. Take care with the first contraction; many people mistakenly re-expand
the contraction would’ve to would of (instead of the correct expansion, would have). The
second contraction, wouldn’t, substitutes an apostrophe for the letter o.
g
can’t. Did you know that cannot is written as one word? The contraction also is one word, with
an apostrophe knocking out an n and an o.
h
he’s. The same contraction works for he is (as in this sentence) and he has.
i
I’d. You’re dropping the letters woul.
j
you’d. The same contraction works for you would (as in this sentence) and you had.
k
She’s. The apostrophe replaces the letter i.
l
could’ve. Be careful in re-expanding this contraction. A common mistake is to write could of, an
expression that’s a total no-no.
m
’99. A date may be shortened, especially if you’re out with Adam. Just be sure that the context
of the sentence doesn’t lead the reader to imagine a different century (2099, perhaps). This 
one is fairly clear, given that we’re nowhere near 2099, and 1899 is probably not the intended
meaning.
n
’06. Not much chance of the reader misunderstanding which numbers are missing here (unless
he or she is really old)!
o
we’re, we’ll. The apostrophes replace the letter a and wi.
p
’12, they’re. In the first part of this sentence, the apostrophe replaces two numerals. It’s okay
to drop numerals as long as the reader is likely to understand what’s been left out. In the
second part of this sentence, the apostrophe replaces the letter a.
q
we’re. The apostrophe replaces the letter a in this contraction of we are.
r
who’s. The apostrophe replaces the letter i in this one.
s
He’s. Only one letter is replaced here (i ), but in this hurried world, every letter counts.
t
We’ll. This one is a bargain. Drop two letters (wi ) and plop in an apostrophe instead.
96
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

97
Chapter 7: One Small Mark, a Whole New Meaning: Apostrophes
u
He’d. The apostrophe is a real space saver in this contraction; it replaces woul.
v
should’ve. If you take out the ha, you can insert an apostrophe and create a contraction.
w
couldn’t. I’m not sure why anyone cares about gossip, but I’m sure that the contraction has an
apostrophe in place of the letter o.
x
isn’t. Drop the o and replace it with an apostrophe.
y
can’t, doesn’t. Two for the price of one here: In the first blank, you substitute an apostrophe for
the letters no. In the second, just the o drops out in favor of the apostrophe.
A
Carol’s, tonight’s. Carol owns the car, so you just need to attach an apostrophe and an s to a
singular form to create a singular possessive. The second answer illustrates a time/money pos-
sessive expression.
B
three months’. The value of time and money can be expressed with a possessive form. Because
you’re talking about months, a plural, the apostrophe goes after the s.
C
Jess and Marty’s. The sentence tells you that the boys own the tires together, so only one 
apostrophe is needed. It’s placed after the last owner’s name. The possessive pronoun her, like
all possessive pronouns, has no apostrophe.
D
boys’, sister-in-law’s. The plural possessive just tacks an apostrophe onto the s, in regular, 
end-in-s plurals. Hyphenated forms are easy too; just attach the apostrophe and an s to the end.
E
Jill’s, brothers’. The first form is singular, so you add an apostrophe and an s. The second form
is a regular plural, so you just add the apostrophe.
F
a day’s, Women’s. The first form falls into the time/money category, and because day is singu-
lar, you add an apostrophe and an s. The second is an irregular plural (not ending in s), so you
tack on an apostrophe and an s.
G
car’s. A singular possessive form calls for an apostrophe and an s.
H
Jess’s and Marty’s. Okay, the brothers are close, but they draw the line at shared toothbrushes.
Each owns a separate brush, so each name needs an apostrophe.
If a word ends in s (Jess, for example), adding an apostrophe and another s creates a spit factor:
People tend to spray saliva all over when saying the word. To avoid this unsanitary problem,
some writers add just the apostrophe (Jess’ ), even though technically they’ve neglected the
extra s. Grammarians generally allow this practice, perhaps because they too dislike being spit
upon. In all but the strictest situations, either form is correct.
I
helpers’. To create a plural possessive of a word ending in s, just attach an apostrophe.
J
judge’s, two thousand dollars’. The first answer is a simple, singular possessive, so an apostro-
phe and an s do the trick. The second is a time/money possessive, and two thousand dollars is
plural, so just an apostrophe is needed.
K
Carol’s, court’s. Two singular words, so only an apostrophe and the letter s are needed to make
each possessive.
L
mother-in-law’s. The apostrophe and the letter s follow the last word of the hyphenated term.
M
Ten hours’. The apostrophe creates an expression meaning ten hours of begging. Because hours
is plural, only an apostrophe is added.

N
car show’s, animals’. The first is a singular possessive, and the second is plural.
O
geese’s. The word geese is irregular. In an irregular plural, an apostrophe and the letter s are
added.
P
fish’s. The word fish is irregular (and unusual); the singular and plural form are the same. To
create a possessive, add an apostrophe and the letter s.
Q
weeks’. To create a plural possessive, add an apostrophe after the letter s.
R
animals’. This regular plural ends with the letter s. To show possession, add an apostrophe.
S
months’. This regular plural needs only an apostrophe after the s to become possessive.
T
cook’s. When one cook becomes possessive, he hogs all the desserts. Oops. That’s life, not
grammar. Just add an apostrophe and the letter s.
U
The doctor belongs to John (in a manner of speaking), so the apostrophe is needed to show
possession.
V
This time expression needs an apostrophe and an s.
W
A simple plural (not possessive, not a numeral, and so on) takes no apostrophe.

“Let Me Speak!“ Quotation Marks
In This Chapter
 Punctuating directly quoted material
 Placing other punctuation marks in sentences with quotations
 Dealing with speaker tags and embedded or interrupted quotations
 Punctuating titles of literary and media works
W
hen I first started teaching, I used to curve and wiggle two fingers of each hand
whenever I was quoting someone else’s words. I assumed the students knew that my
fingers represented the two little lines that precede and follow a direct quotation (“ ”). Big
mistake. It was June before I discovered that they had interpreted my wiggles as a strange
form of wave. Sadly, this error was only one of many they made with quotation marks.
Quotation marks may puzzle you, too, because they’re subject to so many rules, most of
which come from custom and tradition rather than logic. But if you’re willing to put in a
little effort, you can crack the code and ace this important punctuation mark.
Quotation marks have a few important jobs:
 Directly quoted material: Quotation marks surround words drawn from another
person’s speech or writing. In fiction, quotation marks indicate dialogue: “I would love
to receive a single rose,” sighed Sandy. Quotation marks don’t belong in a sentence that
summarizes speech, such as He said that he had caught a cold.
 Titles: Quotation marks surround the titles of certain types of literary or other artworks:
Emily’s first poem, “Ode on a Grecian Olive,” was printed in the school magazine.
 Distancing: Quotation marks sometimes are used to indicate slang or to tell the reader
that the writer doesn’t agree with the words inside the quotation marks: I don’t always
appreciate Emily’s “art.”
In this chapter, you get to practice direct quotations and titles (lucky you!) along with a few
other delights, including the interaction between quotation marks and other punctuation
and quotations embedded inside other quotations. Let the games begin.
Lending Written Words a Voice: 
Punctuating Direct Quotations
The basic rule governing quotation marks is simple. Place quotation marks around words
drawn directly from someone else’s speech or writing to distinguish their ideas and expres-
sion from your own. Or, if you’re writing the Great American Novel, place quotation marks

around dialogue. The tricky part is the interaction between quotation marks and
other punctuation, such as commas, periods, and the like:
 If the quotation has a speaker tag (he murmured, she screamed, and so forth),
the speaker tag needs to be separated from the quotation by a comma.
• If the speaker tag is before the quotation, the comma comes before the
opening quotation mark: Sharon sighed, “I hate hay fever season.”
• If the speaker tag is after the quotation, the comma goes inside the closing
quotation mark: “What a large snout you have,” whispered Richard lovingly.
• If the speaker tag appears in the middle of a quotation, a comma is placed
before the first closing quotation mark and immediately after the tag:
“Here’s the handkerchief,” said Richard, “that I borrowed last week.”
Just because you’re quoting, don’t think you have a license to create a run-on
sentence. (See Chapter 4 for practice with run-ons.) If you have two complete
sentences, quoted or not, they should be written as separate sentences or linked
correctly with a semicolon or a joining word such as and.
 If the quotation ends the sentence, the period goes inside the closing quota-
tion mark. Richard added, “I would like to kiss the tip of your humungous ear.”
 If the quotation is a question or an exclamation, the question mark or the
exclamation mark goes inside the closing quotation mark. “Why did you slap
me?” asked Richard. “I was complimenting you!”
Note: Question and exclamation marks serve as sentence-ending punctuation, so
you don’t need to add a period after the quotation marks.
 If the quotation is neither question nor exclamation, but the sentence in
which the quotation appears is, the question mark or exclamation point goes
outside the closing quotation mark. I can’t believe that Richard said he’s “a
world class lover”! Do you think Sharon will ever get over his “sweet nothings”?
If the quotation is tucked into the sentence without a speaker tag, as in the previ-
ous two sample sentences, no comma separates the quotation from the rest of
the sentence. Nor does the quotation begin with a capital letter. Quotations with
speaker tags, on the other hand, always begin with a capital letter, regardless 
of where the speaker tag falls. In an interrupted quotation (speaker tag in the
middle), the first word of the first half of the quotation is capitalized, but the first
word of the second half is not, unless it’s a proper name.
 Semicolons and colons always go outside the quotation marks. Mary explained
that the book was “too long”; I told her to read it anyway.
Enough with the explanation. Put the pedal to the metal in each of the following sen-
tences. Your job is to identify the direct quotation, and fill in the proper punctuation,
in the proper order, in the proper places. Here and there I add extra information in
parentheses at the end of the sentence.
Q. The annual company softball game is tomorrow declared Becky.
A. “The annual company softball game is tomorrow,” declared Becky. Don’t count 
yourself right unless you placed the comma inside the closing quotation mark.

3. No one knew how to answer Andy, who in the past has been called overly sensitive.
4. Gus said No one wanted Andy at third base; the entire Snyder family has terribly slow
reaction time (The first part of the sentence — No one wanted Andy at third base — is a
quotation, but the second part is not.)
5. Who wants to win asked the boss in a commanding, take-no-prisoners tone.
6. Did she mean it when she said that we were not hard-boiled enough to play decently
7. Sarah remarked I dare anyone to call Andy soft (The statement Sarah is making is an
exclamation.)
8. The opposing team, everyone knows, is first in the league and last in our company’s heart

Embedding One Quotation inside Another
You had to ask. Sigh. Embedded quotations don’t turn up very frequently, but when
they do, you must pay close attention. Here’s the deal: The embedded quotation is
enclosed in single quotation marks (‘ ’), and the surrounding quotation is placed in
the usual double quotation marks (“ ”). So far, so good. The problem comes when this
sort of situation requires other punctuation, and it pretty much always does. Follow
these guidelines:
103
Chapter 8: “Let Me Speak!” Quotation Marks

 If the embedded quotation is at the end of the larger quotation, the two clos-
ing quotation marks are next to each other, with the single mark first. Any
commas or periods you need go inside both closing marks. “I hate the term
‘frozen rope,’” said Sharon. Question marks and exclamation points follow the
rule of logic: If the internal quotation is a question or an exclamation, place the ?
or the ! inside the single closing mark. If the internal quotation isn’t a question or
an exclamation but the larger quotation is, place the ? or the ! outside the single
closing mark but inside the double closing mark (simply put, in between them).
 If the embedded quotation is at the beginning or in the middle of the larger
quotation, any commas surrounding it follow the rules described in the previous
section. In other words, commas that precede the embedded quotation go in
front of the opening double quotation mark. Commas that follow the embedded
quotation go inside the closing single quotation mark. Sharon exclaimed, “‘A
frozen rope’ is what she hit!” and “When Sharon started talking about ‘a frozen
rope,’ I cheered,” said Harry, who is supposed to be neutral.
The rules in this chapter follow American-style English. In Britain, single and double
quotation marks are called inverted commas, and they’re reversed. If you’re in London
(lucky you! I love London!), you may want to write a single quotation mark wherever
I’ve placed a double, and a double wherever I’ve plopped a single.
Can you place the quotation marks and other punctuation in the right places in these
sentences? Write the appropriate punctuation marks in the appropriate spots. Some
helpful information is in parentheses at the end of the sentence.
Q. I think that I shall never see a summer’s romance more lovely and more temperate
intoned Richard, who believes that quoting Shakespeare is the best way to impress
women. (The embedded quotation is more lovely and more temperate.)
A. “I think that I shall never see a summer’s romance ‘more lovely and more temperate‚’”
intoned Richard, who believes that quoting Shakespeare is the best way to impress
women. Notice that the comma after temperate goes inside both closing quotation marks,
the single and the double.
21. Jane Austen would have a lot to say to Richard about his more lovely nonsense com-
mented Sharon. (The embedded quotation is more lovely.)
22. Sharon went on to say that her favorite quotation concerns a truth universally acknowl-
edged (The embedded quotation is a truth universally acknowledged.)
23. Did Richard really ask about Shakespeare’s sonatas asked Clair. (The embedded quotation
is Shakespeare’s sonatas.)
24. Betsy replied, No, he asked about Shakespeare’s bonnets (The embedded quotation is
Shakespeare’s bonnets.)
25. I can’t believe he talked about beauteous bonnets sighed Sharon. (The embedded quota-
tion is beauteous bonnets. Just to make this one harder, make the larger quotation an
exclamation.)
26. Betsy has no patience for what she terms Richard’s posturing explained Clair. (The
embedded quotation is Richard’s posturing.)
104
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

27. Clair went on to ask Don’t you think that Richard is what I call an educated guy who
means well (The embedded quotation is an educated guy who means well.)
28. No, he claims he’s just trying to make girls think he’s a player commented Sharon. 
(The embedded quotation is a player.)
29. I can’t believe that anyone would call him a player exclaimed Betsy.
30. I’m going to give him A Summer’s Pay said Sharon, who had a copy of the poem in her
bag. (The embedded quotation here is actually a poem title, A Summer’s Pay. Poem titles,
as I explain in the next section, belong in quotation marks. Treat the title like any other
embedded quotation.)
Punctuating Titles
Punctuating titles is easy, especially if you’re a sports fan. Imagine a basketball player,
one who tops seven feet. Next to him place a jockey; most jockeys hover around five
feet. Got the picture? Good. When you’re deciding how to punctuate a title, figure out
whether you’re dealing with Yao Ming (NBA player) or Mike Smith (Derby rider), using
theses rules:
 Titles that are italicized or underlined: The basketball player represents full-
length works — novels, magazines, television series, plays, epic poems, films,
and the like. The titles of those works are italicized or underlined.
 Titles that are placed in quotation marks: The jockey, on the other hand, repre-
sents smaller works or parts of a whole — a poem, a short story, a single episode
of a television show, a song, an article — you get the idea. The titles of these
little guys aren’t italicized or underlined; they’re placed in quotation marks.
Okay, I admit that my sports comparison falls apart in one case: Pamphlets, which
can be short, fall into the underlined-title category because regardless of length,
they’re still considered full-length works.
These rules apply to titles that are tucked into sentences. Centered titles, all alone at
the top of a page, don’t get any special treatment: no italics, no underlining, and no quo-
tation marks. The centering and placement are enough to call attention to the title, so
nothing else is called for, unless the centered title refers to some other literary work. In
that case the embedded title is punctuated as described in the previous bulleted list.
When a title in quotation marks is part of a sentence, it sometimes tangles with other
punctuation marks. The rules in American English (British English is different) call for
any commas or periods after the title to be placed inside the quotation marks. So if
the title is the last thing in the sentence, the period of the sentence comes before the
closing quotation mark. Question marks and exclamation points, on the other hand,
don’t go inside the quotation marks unless they are actually part of the title. For
example, suppose you write a poem and call it “Why Is the Sky Blue Again?” because
you can’t stop wondering why the sky isn’t green. The question mark must always
appear inside the closing quotation mark because it’s part of the title.
If a title that ends with a question mark is the last thing in a sentence, the question
mark ends the sentence. Don’t place both a period and a question mark at the end of
the same sentence.
105
Chapter 8: “Let Me Speak!” Quotation Marks

All set for a practice lap around the track? Check out the title in this series of sen-
tences. Place quotation marks around the title if necessary, adding endmarks when
necessary; otherwise, underline the title. Here and there you find parentheses at the
end of a sentence, in which I add some information to help you.
Q. Have you read Sarah’s latest poem, Sonnet for the Tax Assessor (The sentence is a ques-
tion, but the title isn’t.)
A. Have you read Sarah’s latest poem, “Sonnet for the Tax Assessor”? The title of a poem
takes quotation marks. Question marks never go inside the quotation marks unless the
title itself is a question.
31. Sarah’s poem will be published in a collection entitled Tax Day Blues
32. Mary’s fifth best-seller, Publish Your Poetry Now, inspired Sarah.
33. Some of us wish that Sarah had read the recent newspaper article, Forget About Writing
Poetry.
34. Julie, an accomplished violinist, has turned Sarah’s poem into a song, although she
changed the name to Sonata Taxiana.
35. She’s including it on her next CD, Songs of April.
36. I may listen to it if I can bring myself to turn off my favorite television show, Big Brother
and Sister
37. During a recent episode entitled Sister Knows Everything the main character broke into
her brother’s blog.
38. In the blog was a draft of Who Will Be My First Love?, a play that, trust me, will never be
produced.
39. Tonight Mary and Sarah are drafting an article entitled A Resolution to Revolutionize
Poetry
40. They plan to publish their article in The New York Times.

What I Did during Summer Vacation
by Tommy Brainfree
This summer I went to Camp Waterbug, which was the setting for a 
famous poem by William Long entitled Winnebago My Winnebago. At 
Camp Waterbug I learned to paddle a canoe without tipping it over more 
than twice a trip. My counselor even wrote an article about me in the 
camp newsletter, Waterbug Bites. The article was called How to Tip a 
Canoe. The counselor said, Brainfree is well named. I was not upset 
because I believed him (eventually) when he explained that the comment 
was an editing error.
 
Are you sure? I asked him when I first read it.
 
You know, he responded quickly, that I have a lot of respect for you. 
I nodded in agreement, but that night I placed a bunch of frogs under his 
sheets, just in case he thought about writing How to Fool a Camper. One 
of the frogs had a little label on his leg that read JUST KIDDING TOO.
 
At the last campfire gathering I sang a song from the musical 
Fiddler on the Roof. The song was called If I Were a Rich Man. I 
changed the first line to If I were a counselor. I won’t quote the rest of the 
song because I’m still serving the detention my counselor gave me, even 
though I’m back home now.

Chapter 8: “Let Me Speak!” Quotation Marks

Answers to Quotation Problems
a
“I plan to pitch,” added Becky, who once tried out for the Olympics. The directly quoted
words, I plan to pitch, are enclosed in quotation marks. The comma that sets off the speaker 
tag added Becky goes inside the closing quotation mark.
b
Andy interrupted‚ “As usual I will play third base.” The speaker tag comes first in this sen-
tence, so the comma is placed before the opening quotation mark. The period that ends the
sentence goes inside the closing quotation mark.
c
No one knew how to answer Andy, who in the past has been called “overly sensitive.” The
quotation is short, but it still deserves double quotation marks. Single quotation marks, in
American usage, are reserved for embedded quotations. British custom is different, perhaps
because they eat all those cucumber sandwiches. The period at the end of the sentence is
placed, as periods always are in American usage, inside the closing quotation mark. Notice that
this quotation doesn’t have a speaker tag, so it isn’t preceded by a comma, and it doesn’t start
with a capital letter.
d
Gus said, “No one wanted Andy at third base”; the entire Snyder family has terribly slow
reaction time. The speaker tag is followed by a comma. A semicolon always goes outside the
closing quotation mark, unless you’re quoting a long passage that has a semicolon somewhere
inside. A period ends the sentence.
e
“Who wants to win?” asked the boss in a commanding, take-no-prisoners tone. Because 
the quoted words are a question, the question mark goes inside the closing quotation mark.
Okay, everybody knows that boss’s questions aren’t real questions — they’re more like threats.
Grammatically speaking, however, they fall into the question category and thus take a question
mark.
f
Did she mean it when she said that we were “not hard-boiled enough to play decently”? The
quoted words aren’t a question, but the entire sentence is. The question mark belongs outside
the closing quotation mark. By the way, if both the sentence and the quotation are questions,
the question mark belongs inside the closing quotation mark.
g
Sarah remarked, “I dare anyone to call Andy soft!” A comma separates the speaker tag (Sarah
remarked) from the quotation and precedes the opening quotation mark. Because the quoted
words are an exclamation, the exclamation point belongs inside the closing quotation mark.
h
The opposing team, everyone knows, is “first in the league and last in our company’s heart”!
The hint in parentheses gives rationale for the answer. Because the whole statement is an excla-
mation, the exclamation point belongs outside the closing quotation mark.
i
“The odds favor our opponents,” sighed Becky, “but I will not give up.” Here’s an interrupted
quotation, with the speaker tag in the middle. Unlike the rude comments that seem to occur
every five minutes when I’m trying to make a point about grammar, this sort of interruption is
perfectly proper. Just be sure that the two parts of the quotation are punctuated correctly. In
this question, the quoted material makes up one sentence, so the second half begins with a
lowercase letter.
If each part of the quotation can stand alone as a complete sentence (see Chapter 4 for more
detail), don’t run the two together as one sentence. Instead, put a period after the speaker tag
and make the second half of the quotation into a separate sentence enclosed in quotation
marks. Or, place a period after the first half of the quotation and capitalize the first word of the
rest of the quotation. Here’s an example, adapted from question 9: “The odds favor our oppo-
nents,” sighed Becky. “I will not give up.”

j
The league handbook states that “all decisions regarding player placement are subject to
the umpire’s approval.” Here’s a nice little quotation tucked into the sentence. Because it’s
tucked in without a speaker tag, it takes no comma or capital letter. The period at the end of
the sentence goes inside the closing quotation mark.
k
The umpire has been known to label us “out-of-shape players who think they belong in the
Olympics.” Ah yes, the joy of amateur sport! This quotation is plopped into the sentence with-
out a speaker tag, so the first word takes no capital and isn’t preceded by a comma. It ends with
a period, which is slipped inside the closing quotation mark.
l
“Do you think there will be a rain delay?” inquired Harry, the team’s trainer. Harry’s words
are a question, so the question mark goes inside the closing quotation mark.
m
Harry also asked‚ “Has anyone checked Becky’s shoes to make sure that she hasn’t sharp-
ened her spikes again?” This speaker tag Harry also asked begins the sentence. It’s set off by a
comma, which precedes the opening quotation mark. The quoted words form a question (actu-
ally, they’re a last-ditch effort to avoid a trip to the emergency room), so the question mark
belongs inside the quotation marks.
n
Surely the umpire doesn’t think that Becky would violate the rule that states, “Fair play is
essential”! Okay, the parentheses tell you that the writer is exclaiming. The whole sentence is
an exclamation, and the quoted words are fairly mild, so the exclamation point belongs to the
sentence, not to the quotation. Place it outside the closing quotation mark.
o
“Becky has been known to cork her bat,” commented Harry. A straightforward statement with
a speaker tag commented Harry calls for a comma inside the closing quotation mark. The quota-
tion is a complete sentence. In quoted material, the period that normally ends the sentence is
replaced by a comma, because the sentence continues on — in this case, with commented Harry.
Periods don’t belong in the middle of a sentence unless they’re part of an abbreviation.
p
“The corking,” muttered Becky, “has never been proved.” A speaker tag breaks into this quo-
tation and is set off by commas. The one after corking goes inside, because when you’re ending
a quotation or part of a quotation, the comma or period always goes inside. Ditto at the end of
the sentence; the period needs to be inserted inside the closing quotation mark. (Think of these
punctuation marks as couch potatoes who never go outside.)
q
“Oh yes it has,” countered Sarah. “I drilled a couple of holes and found plenty of cork.” Did 
I catch you here? The quoted words form two complete sentences. You can’t join two complete
sentences with a comma, even if the sentences are quotations. The comma is too weak to do
the job. The first quotation ends with a comma tucked inside the quotation marks, and the first
sentence ends with Sarah. The second sentence should be surrounded by quotation marks, and
the last period goes inside.
r
Sarah has not often been called “a team player.” Okay, dokey. No speaker tag (no one is iden-
tified as the one who called), so no comma or capital letter marks the quotation. The sarcasm
of team player is indicated by the quotation marks.
s
“If we could just find a player of Babe Ruth’s caliber!” Because the sentence is an exclama-
tion, the exclamation mark takes its rightful place inside the closing quotation mark.
t
Just then Becky hit her trademark “frozen rope” to left field. These quotation marks tell the
reader that frozen rope is slang, okay for informal speech or writing only.
u
“Jane Austen would have a lot to say to Richard about his ‘more lovely’ nonsense,” com-
mented Sharon. When one quotation is planted inside another, the embedded words are
enclosed by single quotation marks. I’m talking about America here; in Britain, this practice is
sometimes reversed.
109
Chapter 8: “Let Me Speak!” Quotation Marks

v
Sharon went on to say that her “favorite quotation concerns ‘a truth universally acknowl-
edged.’” You may want to sort out all these squiggles with a magnifying glass! The embedded
quotation gets single marks, and the embedder (sounds like someone you don’t want to meet at
a party) gets double quotation marks. When the two occur at the same spot — in this case at
the end of the sentence — the period plops down inside both closing marks.
w
“Did Richard really ask about ‘Shakespeare’s sonatas’?” asked Clair. At first glance this sen-
tence looks like a good example of why grammarians are unpopular. It appears far too compli-
cated to punctuate correctly. The secret is that in this sentence, the punctuation actually makes
sense. Just take it one step at a time. The embedded quotation takes single quotation marks.
Because the embedded quotation is not a question, the question mark follows the closing
single quotation mark. The larger quotation, on the other hand, is a question, so the question
mark goes inside the closing double quotation mark. See, I told you it was easy!
x
Betsy replied, “No, he asked about ‘Shakespeare’s bonnets.’” Another fun sentence. The
embedded quotation and the larger quotation are both statements, so the period goes inside
both closing marks.
y
“I can’t believe he talked about ‘beauteous bonnets’!” sighed Sharon. Are you having a good
time yet? The embedded quotation isn’t an exclamation, so the exclamation point stays outside
the single quotation marks. The larger quotation is an exclamation, so the exclamation point
goes inside the closing double quotation mark.
A
“Betsy has no patience for what she terms ‘Richard’s posturing,’” explained Clair. When
both quotations end at the same spot, any periods or commas go inside both closing marks.
B
Clair went on to ask, “Don’t you think that Richard is what I call ‘an educated guy who means
well’?” This is a complicated one. The embedded quotation isn’t a question, so its closing 
quotation mark precedes the question mark. The larger quotation is a question, so its closing
quotation mark goes after the question mark.
C
“No, he claims he’s trying to make girls think he’s ‘a player,’” commented Sharon. Once
again, both the embedded and the larger quotation end at the same place. The comma goes
inside both closing quotation marks.
D
“I can’t believe that anyone would call him ‘a player’!” exclaimed Betsy. The larger quotation
is an exclamation, so the exclamation point belongs inside the closing double quotation mark.
The embedded quotation is just a statement, so its closing quotation mark precedes the excla-
mation point.
E
“I’m going to give him ‘A Summer’s Pay,’” said Sharon, who had a copy of the poem in her
bag. Embedded titles are the same as embedded quotations, so the comma goes inside both
closing quotation marks.
F
Tax Day Blues. If it’s a collection, it’s a full-length work. Full-length works are underlined or ital-
icized, not placed in quotation marks.
G
Publish Your Poetry Now. The book title is underlined.
H
“Forget About Writing Poetry.” The period following a quotation or a title in quotation marks
goes inside the closing quotation mark.
I
“Sonata Taxiana.” The period always goes inside a closing quotation mark, at least in America.
In Britain the period is generally outside, playing cricket. Just kidding about the cricket.
J
Songs of April. A CD is a full-length work, so the title is underlined or italicized.
110
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

K
Big Brother and Sister. The title of the whole series is underlined. (You can italicize it instead.)
The title of an individual episode goes in quotation marks.
L
“Sister Knows Everything,” I don’t have a blog, but if I did, I wouldn’t want anyone breaking in!
The episode title belongs in quotation marks. The series title gets underlined. (Italics may sub
for underlining, if you wish.) The introductory expression calls for a comma, which should be
placed inside the quotation marks.
M
Who Will Be My First Love? This one is complicated. A question mark is part of the title, which
is underlined because a play is a full-length work. The comma in the sentence follows the title.
(See Chapter 5 for more information on commas.)
N
“A Resolution to Revolutionize Poetry.” A resolution isn’t a book-length work, so quotation
marks do the trick. The period ending the sentence goes inside the closing mark.
O
The New York Times. The newspaper name is underlined or italicized, in contrast to an article
title, which belongs in quotation marks.
What I Did during Summer Vacation
by Tommy Brainfree
This summer I went to Camp Waterbug, which was the setting for a 
famous poem by William Long entitled “Winnebago My Winnebago.” At 
Camp Waterbug I learned to paddle a canoe without tipping it over more 
than twice a trip. My counselor even wrote an article about me in the camp 
newsletter, Waterbug Bites. The article was called “How to Tip a Canoe.” 
The counselor said, “Brainfree is well named.” I was not upset because I 
believed him (eventually) when he explained that the comment was an 
editing error.
 
“Are you sure?” I asked him when I first read it.
 
“You know,” he responded quickly, “that I have a lot of respect for

his sheets, just in case he thought about writing “How to Fool a Camper.” 
One of the frogs had a little label on his leg that read “JUST KIDDING

At the last campfire gathering I sang a song from the musical 
Fiddler on the Roof. The song was called “If I Were a Rich Man.” I 
changed the first line to “If I were a counselor.” I won’t quote the rest of the 
song because I’m still serving the detention my counselor gave me, even 
though I’m back home now.

Hitting the Big Time: Capital Letters
In This Chapter
 Choosing capitals for job and personal titles
 Capitalizing geographical names
 Identifying school and business terms that should be capitalized
 Selecting capital letters for literary and media titles
 Placing capital letters in abbreviations
P
oetry is something I love, but even I have to admit that poets get away with murder.
Specifically, they murder the rules for capital letters whenever they want to. A poet can
write “i sent sally to sue,” and no one blinks. Unfortunately, the rest of us have to conform
to capitalization customs.
Most people know the basics: Capital letters are needed for proper names, the personal pro-
noun I, and the first letter of a sentence. Trouble may arrive with the finer points of capital
letters — in quotations (which I cover in Chapter 8), titles (both people and publications),
abbreviations, and school or business terms. Never fear. In this chapter you get to practice
all those topics.
Even for nonpoets, the rules for capital letters may vary. The major style setters in the land
of grammar (yes, grammar has style, and no, grammarians aren’t immune to trends) some-
times disagree about what should be capitalized and what shouldn’t. In this workbook I
follow the most common capitalization styles. If you’re writing for a specific publication or 
a particular teacher, you may want to check which twenty-pound book of rules (also known
as a style manual) you should follow. The most common are those manuals published by
the Modern Language Association (academic writing in the humanities), the American
Psychological Association (science and social science writing), and the University of
Chicago (general interest and academic publishing).
Bowing to Convention and Etiquette: 
People’s Names and Titles
Unless you’re a poet or an eccentric rock star who wants to buck the trend, you capitalize
your name — first, last, and initials. Titles — job or personal — are a different story. The
general rules are as follows:
 A title preceding and attached to a name is capitalized (Mr. Smith, Professor Wiley, Lord
Cummings, and so forth). Small, unimportant words in titles (a, the, of, and the like) are
always lowercased.

 Titles written after or without a name are generally not capitalized (George Wiley,
professor of psychology or Danielle Smith, director of paper distribution, for
instance).
 If the title names a post of the highest national or international importance (President,
Vice President, Secretary General, and the like), it may be capitalized even when used
alone, though some style manuals go for lowercase regardless of rank.
Now that you get the idea, test yourself. In the following sentences, add capital letters
where needed. Lowercase any extra capitals. (Just cross out the offending letter and
substitute the correct form.) Note: In this section, correct only personal names and
people’s titles — you can assume that everything else is correct.
Q. The reverend archie smith, Chief Executive of the Homeless Council, has invited senator
Bickford to next month’s fundraiser.
A. Reverend, Archie, Smith, chief, executive, Senator. Personal names are always capital-
ized, so Archie Smith needs capitals. Reverend and Senator precede the names (Archie
Smith and Bickford) and act as part of the person’s name, not just a description of their
jobs. Thus they should be capitalized. The title chief executive follows the name and isn’t
capitalized.

sticky tape.
2. Herman harris, chief city engineer, has promised to hold the line on tape spending.
3. However, the Municipal Dogcatcher, Agnes e. Bark, insists on taping “Lost Dog —

17. However, Holy, who has been a Bishop for twelve years, was puzzled by the question.
18. “I feel fortunate compared to my brother, who was General Manager of the New Jersey
Devils hockey team,” Bishop Holy remarked.
19. Reginald Holy joined the Devils twenty years ago as a Player Development Director.
20. Holy hopes to be appointed President of the National Hockey League someday.
Entering the Worlds of Business 
and Academia
Whether you bring home a paycheck or a report card, you should take care to capitalize 
properly. Surprisingly, the worlds of business and education have a lot in common:
 The place where it all happens: Capitalize the name of the company or school
(Superlative Widgets International or University of Rock and Roll, for example).
General words that may refer to a number of businesses or academic institutions
(university, conglomerate, and so forth) are written in lowercase.
 Working units: Business activities (management, advertising, or marketing, perhaps)
and general academic tasks, years, and subjects (such as research, sophomore, and his-
tory) aren’t capitalized. The name of a specific department (Research and Development
Division, Department of Cultural Anthropology) may be capitalized. Project names (the
Zero Task Force) and course names (Psychological Interpretations of Belly-Button Rings)
are capitalized. In these capitalized terms, articles and prepositions (a, the, for, and so
forth) are generally lowercased.
Course titles and the names of businesses or institutions are capitalized according to
the “headline style” rules of titles, which I describe in “Capitalizing Titles of Literary
and Media Works” later in this chapter. Briefly, capitalize the first word, all nouns and
verbs, and any important words in the title. Short, relational words such as of, for, by,
and from aren’t capitalized, nor are articles such as a, an, and the.
 Products: General terms for items produced or sold (widgets, guarantees, consul-
tation fee, and the like) aren’t capitalized. Neither are academic degrees or
awards (master’s, endowed chair, fellowship, doctorate, and so forth). If a specific
brand is named, however, roll out the big letters (Christopher Columbus Award for
Round-Trip Travel, Universal Widget Groove Simulator, and so on).
Some companies take a tip from poets and change the usual capitalization customs.
Sigh. As a grammarian, I’m not happy, but people (and companies) have the right to
ruin their own names. So if you know that a company prefers a particular format
(eBay or Banjos ’n Strings, for example), bow your head and accept fate.
Now that you have the basics, try these questions. I thoughtfully include both busi-
ness and school references so that everyone feels at home. If a word needs a capital
letter, cross out the offending letter and insert the capital. If a word has an unneces-
sary capital letter, cross out the offender and insert a lowercase letter.

Chapter 9: Hitting the Big Time: Capital Letters

Q. The eldest daughter of Matt Brady, founder of belly buttons are we, is a senior at the uni-
versity of southeast hogwash, where she is majoring in navel repair.
A. Belly Buttons Are We, University of Southeast Hogwash. The name of the company is
capitalized, as is the name of the school. The year of study (senior) isn’t capitalized, nor 
is the major.
21. After extensive research, the united nose ring company has determined that most college
freshmen prefer silver rings.
22. The spokesperson for the Company commented that “silver rocks their world.”
23. “I wore a gold ring to the curriculum critique committee last semester,” explained Fred P.
Stileless, who is the student representative to all university committees.
24. “The gold ring definitely turned off some juniors I was interested in romantically,”
explained Fred, who hasn’t had a date, he says, since he was a high school senior.
25. The spokesperson surveyed competing products, including a silver-gold combination
manufactured by in style or else, inc., a division of klepto industrials.
26. The silver that the Jewelers use is imported from “four or five big countries.”
27. The company claims that the silver attracts attention and costs less, though the depart-
ment of product development has issued a statement denying “any attractive power” for
the metal.
28. Stileless says that he doesn’t care about scientific studies because, though he originally
majored in chemistry, “introduction to fashion, a course I took in freshman year, opened
my eyes to art and beauty.”
29. Stileless expects to receive a bachelor’s degree with a concentration in fashion 
imperatives.
30. Import-export Companies will have to switch from gold to silver.
Capitalizing Titles of Literary 
and Media Works
If you write an ode to homework or a scientific study on the biological effects of too
many final exams, how do you capitalize the title? The answer depends on the style
you’re following:
 Literary, creative, and general-interest works are capitalized in “headline
style.” Headline style specifies capital letters for the first and last word of the
title and subtitle, in addition to all nouns, verbs, and descriptive words, and any
other words that require emphasis. Articles (a, an, the) and prepositions (among,
by, for, and the like) are usually in lowercase. All the headings in this book are in
headline style.
 The titles of scientific works employ “sentence style,” which calls for capital
letters only for the first word of the title and subtitle and for proper nouns.
Everything else is lowercased. (The title of a scientific paper in sentence style:
“Cloning fruit flies: Hazards of fly bites.”)
116
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

Ready to get to work? The following titles are written without any capital letters at all.
Cross out the offending letters and insert capitals above them where needed. The style
you should follow (headline or sentence) is specified in parentheses at the end of each
title. By the way, titles of short works are enclosed in quotation marks. Titles of full-length
works are italicized. (See Chapter 8 for more information on the punctuation of titles.)
Q. “the wonders of homework completed: an ode” (headline)
A. “The Wonders of Homework Completed: An Ode” The first word of the title and subtitle
(The, An) are always capitalized. So are the nouns (Wonders, Homework) and descriptive
words (Completed). The preposition (of) is left in lowercase.
31. moby duck: a tale of obsessive bird watching (headline)
32. “an analysis of the duckensis mobyous: the consequences of habitat shrinkage on popula-
tion” (sentence)
33. “call me izzy smell: my life as a duck hunter” (headline)
34. the duck and i: essays on the relationship between human beings and feathered species
(sentence)
35. duck and cover: a cookbook (headline)
36. “the duck stops here: political wisdom from the environmental movement” (sentence)
37. duck upped: how the duck triumphed over the hunter (headline)
38. “moby platypus doesn’t live here anymore” (headline)
39. “population estimates of the platypus: an inexact science” (sentence)
40. for the love of a duck: a sentimental memoir (headline)
Placing Geographical Capitals
Where am I? I’m in a city (lowercase), popularly known as New York (capitalized), or,
as my husband likes to say, on a small island (lowercase) off the coast of New Jersey
(capitalized). The island, by the way, is Manhattan (capitalized).
Get the idea? Place names are in lowercase when they’re generic, one-term-fits-all
(river, canyon, town, street, and so forth). Place names are capitalized when they’re
the specific, proper names (Manhattan, North Dakota, Tibet, Amazon River, and such).
One more point about places: the compass points are in lowercase when they refer to
directions (head south for ten miles, for example) and capitalized when they refer to
areas of the country (the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and so on).
Place names that have become so much a part of the common vocabulary that they
no longer refer to actual locations aren’t capitalized (french fries, russian roulette,
egyptian cotton, and so on).
Now that you’re oh-so-savvy about places and capital letters, peer at the underlined
words in the following sentences and decide whether a capital letter is appropriate. If
so, draw three lines under the letter needing to be capitalized. If not, leave the word
alone.
117
Chapter 9: Hitting the Big Time: Capital Letters

Q. Megan often revs up her motorcycle and speeds south, arriving at the shores of the 
mississippi river around sunset.
A. correct, Mississippi River. The first underlined word is a direction, not an area, so lower-
case is appropriate for south. The second underlined term is a proper, specific name, so
capital letters are needed.
41. Rowing across the hudson river is difficult for Andy, who hates oceans, lakes, and all
bodies of water.
42. Andy, who was born in schenectady, new york, pretends to be a ukranian prince.
43. His latest bride, Abby, hails from an island near Andy’s castle, which is just north of the
strait of gibraltar.
44. Megan gave a wedding present to the happy couple: two round-trip tickets to a beautiful
natural canyon in the southwest.
45. The last time Megan visited new mexico, she was arrested by a constable visiting from
europe.
46. “The fact that I am not from this continent is no reason to deny my arresting privileges,”
said Constable Creary. “The north american justice system was modeled after the one in
my country.”
47. “Do you expect me to honor a trans-atlantic arrest?” queried the judge.
48. The european cop, who was actually from belgium, was so discouraged that he grabbed a
turkish towel and sent out for a spanish omelet.
49. Megan did no jail time in santa fe, but she was imprisoned briefly in a small village north
of omaha.
50. Her offense was wading in a stream and trampling on six gardens in the west.
AM or p.m.? Capitalizing Abbreviations
Abbreviations save you time, but they also present you with a couple of annoying
problems, namely whether to capitalize or lowercase and whether a period is needed.
The world of abbreviations, I must confess, is prime real estate for turf wars. Some
publications and institutions proudly announce that “we don’t capitalize a.m.” whereas
others declare exactly the opposite, choosing “AM” instead. (Both are correct, but
don’t mix the forms.) So if you’re writing for an organization with a chip on its collec-
tive shoulder, you’re wise to ask in advance for a list of the publication’s or school’s
preferences. In this section I give you the one-size-fits-most abbreviated forms. These
are the general guidelines:
 Acronyms — forms created by the first letter of each word (NATO, UNICEF,
OPEC, and so forth) — take capitals but not periods.
 Initials and titles are capitalized and take periods (George W. Bush and Msgr.
Sullivan, for example). The three most common titles — Mr., Mrs., and Ms.— are
always capitalized and usually written with periods, though the current trend is
to skip the period because the long forms of these words are never used, with
the exception of “Mister,” and even that is rare.
118
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

 Latin abbreviations aren’t usually capitalized but do end with a period. Latinate
abbreviations include e.g. (for example), ibid. (in the same place), and etc. (and
so forth). The abbreviations for morning and afternoon may be written with capi-
tal letters and no periods (AM and PM) or without capitals but with periods (a.m.
and p.m.). Your choice, but be consistent.
 State abbreviations used to be written with an initial capital letter, lowercase let-
ters as needed, and a concluding period (Ind. and Ala. for Indiana and Alabama,
for example). However, people now use the two-letter, no-period, capitalized
forms created by the post office (IN and AL).
 A capitalized long form normally has a capitalized abbreviation, and vice versa
(lowercase long forms pair with lowercase abbreviations).
 When an abbreviation comes at the end of a sentence, the period for the abbre-
viation does double duty as an endmark. Don’t place two periods in a row!
Okay, try your hand at abbreviating. Check out the full word, which I place in lower-
case letters, even when capital letters are called for. See whether you can insert the
proper abbreviation or acronym for the following words, taking care to capitalize
where necessary and filling in the blanks with your answers.

Moby, the Life Of a Duck: A Book Report
If you are ever given a book about Ducks, take my advice and burn it. When 
i had to read Moby Duck, the Teacher promised me that it was good. She 
said that “Excitement was on every page.” I don’t think so! The story is set 
in the northwest, where a duckling with special powers is born. Moby 
actually goes to school and earns a Doctorate in bird Science! After a really 
boring account of Moby’s Freshman year, the book turns to his career as a 
Flight Instructor. I was very happy to see him fly away at the end of the 
book.

Answers to Capitalization Problems
a
Mayor. Titles and proper names take capitals; common nouns, such as servants and tape, don’t.
b
Harris. Names take capitals, but titles written after the name usually don’t.
c
municipal dogcatcher, E. The title in this sentence isn’t attached to the name; in fact, it’s sepa-
rated from the name by a comma. It should be in lowercase. Initials take capitals and periods.
d
Dogcatcher. Now the title is attached to the name, and thus it’s capitalized.
e
Ms. The title Ms. is always capitalized, but the period is optional. After you choose a style, how-
ever, be consistent. Write either Mr., Mrs., and Ms. or Mr, Mrs, and Ms but not some from each set.
f
dogcatchers, Agnes. The common noun dogcatchers doesn’t need a capital letter, but the
proper name Agnes does.
g
correct. The name of the champion must be capitalized. About that name — people are allowed
to spell their own names (and the names of their pets) as they wish. The capital letter inside
the name is a style; you may not like it, but the namer’s preference should be honored.
h
civil servants. Once again, the title and name are in caps, but the common job classification isn’t.
i
correct. This title isn’t attached to a name, so it takes lowercase.
j
correct. Names are in caps, but the title isn’t, except when it precedes the name.
k
vice president. A title that isn’t attached to a name shouldn’t be capitalized.
l
President. In this sentence the title precedes the name and thus should be capitalized.
m
chief financial officer. This title isn’t attached to a name. Go for lowercase.
n
president. Don’t capitalize the title of president written without a name unless you’re talking
about a major world leader such as the President of the United States. (Even then, some style
manuals call for lowercase.)
o
bank president. This title isn’t connected to a name; therefore, it should be lowercased.
p
Reverend. The title precedes the name and becomes part of the name, in a sense. A capital
letter is appropriate.
q
bishop. In this sentence bishop doesn’t precede a name; lowercase is the way to go.
r
general manager. I love the Devils (my son’s favorite team), but even so, lowercase is best for
this title, which isn’t connected to a name.
s
player development director. Another title that’s all by itself. Opt for lowercase.
t
president. To be president is a big deal, but not a big letter.
u
United Nose Ring Company. Although college freshmen think they’re really important (and, of
course, they are), they rate only lowercase. The name of the company is specific and should be
in uppercase.
121
Chapter 9: Hitting the Big Time: Capital Letters

v
company. A common noun such as company isn’t capitalized.
w
Curriculum Critique Committee. The name of the committee and the person (Stileless) should
be written in caps, but the other terms (student representative, university, and the like) aren’t
cap-worthy.
x
correct. Years in school and school levels aren’t capitalized.
y
In Style or Else, Inc., Klepto Industrials. The names of companies are capitalized according to
the preference of the company itself. Most companies follow “headline style,” which is explained
in the section “Capitalizing Titles of Literary and Media Works” in this chapter.
A
jewelers. Don’t capitalize common nouns.
B
Department of Product Development. The name of a department should be capitalized, but
the preposition (of) is lowercased.
C
Introduction to Fashion. Course titles get caps, but subject names and school years don’t.
D
correct. School degrees (bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate) are lowercased, though their abbrevi-
ations aren’t (B.A., M.S., and so on). School subjects aren’t capitalized.
E
companies. This term isn’t the name of a specific company, just a common noun. Lowercase is
what you want.
F
Moby Duck: A Tale of Obsessive Bird Watching In headline style, the first word of the title
(Moby) and subtitle (A) are in caps. Nouns (Duck, Tale, and Watching) and descriptive words
(Obsessive, Bird) are also uppercased. The preposition of merits only lowercase.
G
“An analysis of the Duckensis mobyous: The consequences of habitat shrinkage on popula-
tion” In sentence style capitalization, the first words of the title and subtitle are in caps, but
everything else is in lowercase, with the exception of proper names. In this title, following pre-
ferred scientific style, the names of the genus and species are in italics, with only the genus
name in caps.
H
“Call Me Izzy Smell: My Life As a Duck Hunter” Per headline style, the article (a) is in lower-
case. Did I catch you on “As”? It’s short, but it’s not an article or a preposition, so it rates a 
capital letter.
I
The duck and I: Essays on the relationship between human beings and feathered species
Sentence style titles take caps for the first word of the title and subtitle. The personal pronoun I
is always capitalized.
J
Duck and Cover: A Cookbook Headline style calls for capitals for the first word of the title and
subtitle and all other nouns. The joining word and is lowercased in headline style, unless it
begins a title or subtitle.
K
“The duck stops here: Political wisdom from the environmental movement” Sentence style
gives you two capitals in this title — the first word of the title and subtitle.
L
Duck Upped: How the Duck Triumphed over the Hunter Because this title is in headline
style, everything is in caps except articles (the) and prepositions (over).
M
“Moby Platypus Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” Headline style gives capital letters for all the
words here, as this title contains no articles or prepositions.
N
“Population estimates of the platypus: An inexact science” Sentence style calls for capital let-
ters at the beginning of the title and subtitle. The term platypus isn’t the name of a genus (a sci-
entific category), so it’s written in lowercase.
122
Part II: Mastering Mechanics 

O
For the Love of a Duck: A Sentimental Memoir Headline style mandates lowercase for arti-
cles (the, a) and prepositions (of). The first words of the title and subtitle, even if they’re arti-
cles or prepositions, merit capital letters.
P
Hudson River, correct, correct. The proper name (Hudson River) is in caps, but the common
terms (oceans, lakes) are lowercased.
Q
Schenectady, New York, Ukranian. All proper names, all caps here.
R
correct, correct, Strait of Gibraltar. The names are all in caps, with a lowercase of for the Strait
of Gibraltar. When capitalizing place names that contain several words, follow the “headline
style” of capitalization described in detail in the section entitled “Capitalizing Titles of Literary
and Media Works” in this chapter. The direction north is lowercased.
S
correct, Southwest. The common noun isn’t capitalized, but the area of the country is.
T
New Mexico, Europe. All proper names, all caps.
U
correct, North American, correct. Two common nouns (continent, country) are lowercased, but
the description North American is derived from a proper name (North America) and thus needs
capital letters.
V
trans-Atlantic. This question is a tricky one. The prefix trans- isn’t a proper name, so it’s written
in lowercase. The name of the ocean, on the other hand, needs a capital letter.
W
European, Belgium, correct, correct. Another tricky question. The first two are capitalized
because they’re proper, specific terms. The last two terms (turkish, spanish) are capitalized
when they refer to the countries, but not when they refer to common, everyday objects. A turk-
ish towel isn’t really talking about the country of Turkey but rather about a household object.
Ditto for the omelet.
X
Santa Fe, correct, correct, Omaha. Two names, both in caps. One common term (village) and
one direction (north), no caps.
Y
correct, West. The stream is a common term and doesn’t deserve uppercase. The area of the
country is capitalized.
z

The Pickier Points of Correct
Verb and Pronoun Use

In this part . . . 
W
hen was the last time you chatted with a grammar
teacher? Never? I’m not surprised. When people
find out that someone cares about proper English, they
tend to discover that silence is indeed golden. The urge to
clam up rather than to risk an error is nearly overpower-
ing. However, most grammar teachers aren’t out to nail
anyone for confusing verb tenses. Furthermore, most of
the issues that people obsess about are actually extremely
simple. Take who and whom, for example. Deciding which
one is appropriate is not rocket science; it’s just pronoun
case, which you can practice in Chapter 10. Chapters 11
and 12 help you master tricky (okay, picky) points of pro-
noun and verb usage. If you’ve ever stumbled over every-
one brought their/his/her lunch or she said she has/had 
a cold, these chapters rescue you. Finally, Chapter 13
explains how to deal with verb moods (not irritable or
ecstatic but indicative, imperative, and subjunctive).

 Placing pronouns in to be sentences
 Choosing pronouns for prepositional phrases
 Using possessive pronouns with -ing nouns
M
ost kids I know can switch from He and I are going to do our homework now (reserved
for adult audiences) to Him and me are playing video games (with peers) faster than
an eye can blink. The second sentence, of course, is nonstandard English, but if you need a
way to indicate that the world of rules and proprieties has been left behind, messing up pro-
noun case is a good bet. Just to be clear what I’m talking about: Pronouns are the words
that stand in for the name of a person, place, or thing. Popular pronouns include I, me, and
my (very big with swelled-head types), you and yours (for the less selfish), he, she, it, they,
them, and a bunch of others (good, all-purpose choices).
Case is one of the qualities that all pronouns have. Subject and object pronouns form two of
the three major cases, or families, of pronouns. The third is possessive. (Possessive pronouns
want to know where you are every single minute. Oops, that’s my mother, not possessive
case.) In this chapter I deal mainly with subject and object pronouns. You can find the basics
of possessive-pronoun usage, along with the lowdown on another quality of pronouns —
number — in Chapter 3, and the really advanced (okay, obsessive) pronoun topics, such as
double meanings, in Chapter 11. Here I discuss only one weird possessive situation — when 
a pronoun precedes a noun that was formed from a verb.
Meeting the Subject at Hand and 
the Object of My Affection
Subjects and objects have opposite jobs in a sentence. Briefly, the subject is the doer of 
the action or whatever is in the state of being talked about in the sentence. In the first para-
graph of this chapter, he and I are better than him and me because the sentence needs a
subject for its verb, are going, and he and I are subject pronouns. Objects receive; instead of
acting, they are acted upon. If you scold him and me, those two pronouns resentfully receive
the scolding and thus act as objects. Verbs have objects, and so do some other grammatical
elements, such as prepositions. (I deal with prepositions later in this chapter.) Here are the
contents of the subject- and object-pronoun baskets:
 Subject pronouns include I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who, and whoever.
 Object pronouns are me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, and whomever.

Some pronouns, such as you and it, appear on both lists. They do double duty as both
subject and object pronouns. Don’t worry about them; they’re right for all occasions.
Other one-case-fits-almost-all pronouns are either, most, other, which, and that.
Another type of pronoun is a reflexive, or -self pronoun (myself, himself, ourselves, and so
forth). Use these pronouns only when the action in the sentence doubles back on the
subject. (“I told myself that the grammar test would be easy.” “They washed themselves
50 times during the deodorant shortage.”) You may also insert the -self pronouns for
emphasis. (“She herself baked the cake.”) Don’t place a -self pronoun in any other type of
sentence.
In the following sentences, choose the correct pronoun from the parentheses. Take care
not to send a subject pronoun to do an object pronoun’s job, and vice versa. Violators will
be prosecuted. Try your hand at an example before moving on.
Q. Matt took the precious parchment and gave (she/her) a cheap imitation instead.
A. her. In this sentence, Matt is the one taking and giving. The pronoun her is on the receiv-
ing end because Matt gave the imitation to her. Her is an object pronoun.
1. Matt, Peyton, and (I/me/myself) have a date with destiny.
2. The parchment, which (he/him) discovered in the back pocket of a pair of jeans made in

The dreaded pronouns, who and whom, deserve some, but not all, of the fear that people
apply to them. Like all other subject/object pronoun decisions, you simply have to figure out
how the pronoun functions in the sentence. If you need a subject (someone doing the action
or someone in the state of being described in the sentence), who is your guy. If you need 
an object (a receiver of the action), go with whom. Why are who and whom such a pain?
Probably because they tend to occur in complicated sentences. But if you untangle the sen-
tence and figure out (pardon the expression) who is doing what to whom, you’ll be fine.
Take a ride on the who/whom train and select the proper pronoun from the parentheses in 
the following sentences.
Q. (Who/Whom) can decode the message? Codebusters!
A. Who. The verb can decode needs a subject, someone to do that action. Who is for sub-
jects, and whom is for objects.
21. Does Peyton know (who/whom) should get the information once she’s finished decoding?
22. Matt will discuss the parchment with (whoever/whomever) the buyer sends.
23. (Who/Whom) is his buyer?
24. His buyer is (whoever/whomever) believes Matt’s sales pitch.
25. Also, Matt will sell the parchment to (whoever/whomever) is willing to pay.
26. I don’t think NASA is interested, despite Matt’s claim that an expert from NASA, (who/
whom) isn’t saying much, was seen checking “Mars” and “Alien Life Forms” on the Internet.
27. Do you know (who/whom) the expert consulted?
28. No one seems to know (who/whom) Matt saw.
29. Peyton remains capable of conspiring with NASA, Codebusters, and (whoever/whomever)
else is able to sell a fraudulent document.
30. Matt, (who/whom) I do not trust, has the most sincere face you can imagine.
129
Chapter 10: The Case of It (And Other Pronouns)

31. Peyton, (who/whom) Matt once scolded for cutting class, has a reputation for sincerity.
32. I once heard Peyton explain that those (who/whom) have an honest face can get away
with anything.
33. “If you are one of those people (who/whom) can fake sincerity,” she said, “you can 
accomplish anything.”
34. Peyton states this theory to (whoever/whomever) is willing to listen.
35. I think that (whoever/whomever) trusts Peyton is in big trouble.
Linking Up with Pronouns 
in “To Be” Sentences
Most verbs express action, but mingling with this on-the-go group are forms of the verb “to
be” (am, is, are, was, were, has been, will be, and the like). These verbs are like giant equal
signs linking two equivalents, and for that reason, they’re sometimes called linking verbs.
“Jeremy is the president” is the same as “Jeremy = president.” If you’ve studied algebra, or
even if you haven’t, you know that these statements mean the same even when reversed
(“The president is Jeremy.”) This incredibly boring explanation leads to an important pro-
noun fact: A subject pronoun serves as the subject of a linking verb, and to preserve
reversibility, subject pronouns also follow linking verbs, in the same spot where you nor-
mally expect an object. Therefore, the answer to Who’s there? is “It is she” instead of “It is
her” because you can reverse the first (“She is it”) and not the second (“Her is it”).
When you select pronouns for a linking-verb sentence, be aware that sometimes the verb
changes, so to sound right, a reversible sentence may need a verb adjustment from singu-
lar to plural or vice versa. “It is they” is reversible, at least in theory, because they is a sub-
ject pronoun, even though “they is” doesn’t pass a sound check until you change the verb
to are.
Can you select the appropriate pronoun from the parentheses? Give it a whirl in the following
example and practice exercises. Just to make life more interesting, I’m sprinkling action verbs
into the mix — for more information on pronouns with action verbs, see the earlier section,
“Meeting the Subject at Hand and the Object of My Affection.”
Q. Angelina knows that the true culprit is (he/him) and not Brad.
A. he. Who is he? Only the gossip columnist knows for sure. The grammarian, on the other
hand, is positive that a subject pronoun is the one you want after the linking verb is.
Reverse that portion of the sentence to check yourself: Him is the culprit? I don’t think 
so. He is the culprit? Bingo.
36. The FBI recently announced that the criminals responsible for the theft of a 1972-era
parchment are (they/them).
37. Matt and Peyton met with three FBI agents and promised (they/them) that the parchment
would be returned to the rightful owner.
38. The “rightful owner,” according to Peyton, is (she/her), because Peyton herself purchased
the jeans in which the document was located.
130
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

39. “I can’t read the code,” added Peyton, “but I know a good pair of jeans when I see one, and
besides, the lawful purchaser of both the jeans and the parchment is (I/me).”
40. Matt isn’t so sure; it is (he/him) who will have to go to jail if the FBI decides not to buy
Peyton’s story that “the seller said the document was included in the price.”
41. Agent Tim told (they/them) that the document is vital to national security.
42. As Tim was explaining his theory of the code, his cell phone rang and drew (he/him) away
from the crowd.
43. Tim is an expert in undercover work and claims that with just a bit of makeup and a good
wig he can be “(whoever/whomever).”
44. This month he posed as a code breaker in order to entice Peyton to tell (he/him) more
about the parchment.
45. “Who was on the phone?” I asked Agent Tim. “It was (he/him),” Tim replied, “the master
criminal who created the fake parchment and sold it to Peyton.”
You Talkin’ to Me, or I? Pronouns 
as Objects of Prepositions
Prepositions, not to be confused with propositions (such as Are you busy tonight?) are words
that express relationships. (Come to think of it, propositions concern relationships too.)
Common prepositions include by, for, from, in, on, of, about, after, and before. Prepositions
always have objects, and sometimes those objects are pronouns. Check out the italicized
objects of prepositions in these examples:
Give that umbrella to me or I’ll break it over your head.
The embroidery on the umbrella was done by me alone.
Got the idea? In the first sample sentence, me and head are objects of the prepositions to and
over. In the second, umbrella and me are objects of on and by. Luckily, you don’t have to
worry about umbrella and head. They’re nouns, and they don’t change no matter where they
appear in the sentence. But the pronoun does change (sigh), depending upon its job in the
sentence. And if its job is to be an object of a preposition, it must be an object pronoun. You
can’t give an umbrella to I, nor was the embroidery done by I alone. Not in this grammatical
universe, anyway.
Take a stab at the following sentences, selecting the correct pronoun from the pair in
parentheses. In an attempt to fry your brain, I cleverly (she said modestly) scatter a few
subjects in the exercise.
Q. I won’t accept any packages from (he/him) because last week he sent a quart of pickled
cabbage to (I/me), and my mailbox was sticky for days.
A. him, me. The preposition from needs an object, so your first answer has to be him. To is
also a preposition and should be followed by the object pronoun me.
46. Jessica sang songs to Mom and (she/her) whenever the moon was full.
47. Her latest CD is entitled Of Mom, (I/Me), and the Moon.
131
Chapter 10: The Case of It (And Other Pronouns)

48. I’m going to buy the CD, although a lot of issues remain between Jessica and (I/me).
49. For example, when she broke up with her boyfriend, she stated that she was prettier than
(he/him).
50. However, she has been “looks-challenged” ever since her mother’s dog Spike ran after
(she/her) and took a large bite out of her nose.
51. Aggressive though he may be, you can’t put much past (he/him), and for that reason
Spike is a great watchdog.
52. Spike likes to walk behind (we/us) when we approach the house; he growls at (whoever/
whomever) comes too close.
53. “At (who/whom) is this dog snarling?” I once asked Jessica.
54. “He thinks the letter carrier wants to rob us, so he tries to keep an eye on (he/him),” she
replied as she pieced together a ripped catalogue.
55. “You have to run around (they/them),” added Jessica, speaking of her mother and Spike.
56. Carefully separating the letters addressed to “Spike” from the letters meant for Jessica,
the letter carrier gave the shredded mail to Jessica and (he/him).
57. Spike’s penpals generally include a dog biscuit when writing to (he/him).
58. Spike and Jessica both enjoy getting mail, but Spike loves letters even more than (she/her).
59. Spike’s letters sometimes contain meaty bones from (whoever/whomever) really wants to
catch his attention.
60. Jessica is as fond of meaty bones as (he/him), but she hardly ever receives any.
Matching Possessive Pronouns 
to “-ing” Nouns
I cheated a bit with the title of this section. When I say -ing noun, I mean a noun made
from the -ing form of a verb (swimming, smiling, puttering, and similar words). I’m not
talking about nouns that just happen to contain those three letters, such as king,
wingding, and pudding, among others. Nor am I talking about -ing verb forms used as
verbs or as descriptions of other nouns. For those of you who enjoy grammar terms,
the -ing-noun-made-from-a-verb-form is actually a gerund.
Here’s the deal with pronouns and -ing nouns. You should put a possessive form in
front of these nouns. Why? Because that form keeps the focus in the right place. Take
a look at this sentence:
Carrie hates (me/my) auditioning for the new reality show, Nut Search.
Putting on your thinking cap, you can see that Carrie doesn’t hate me. Instead, Carrie
hates the whole reality-show effort. (My auditioning threatens her sense of privacy
and pretty much guarantees that she won’t get a slot on the show.) Back to grammar:
132
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

my is the best choice because it shifts the reader’s attention to auditioning, where it
belongs, because auditioning is what Carrie hates.
In the situation described in the preceding paragraph, the possessive form of a noun
should also be your choice for the spot in front of an -ing noun. In the sample sen-
tence there, the correct form is Carrie hates Rick’s auditioning . . . , not Carrie hates
Rick auditioning . . . . The same reasoning applies; Carrie doesn’t hate Rick. She just
doesn’t want him on television.
Try your hand at the following example and practice exercises. Circle the pronouns
you love and ignore the ones you hate. To keep you alert, I’ve inserted a few sen-
tences that don’t call for possessive pronouns. Keep your eyes open!
Q. Although I’m not a literary critic, I think that (he/him/his) writing a novel about talking
ocelots is a bad idea.
A. his The bad idea here is the writing, not he or him. The possessive pronoun shifts the
attention to the task, which is the point of the sentence.
61. St. John Lincoln of the Times needs help with (he/him/his) editing and must hire addi-
tional editors.
62. Lincoln said that he loved everything the employment agency did last week except
(they/them/their) sending him too many pronoun-obsessed writers.
63. When Lori went for an interview, she saw (he/him/his) reading a review of The Pronoun
Diet, a new grammar text.
64. “I object to (she/her) insisting on one pronoun per paragraph,” he muttered.
65. When I applied, Lincoln took (I/me/my) editing seriously.
66. However, he hated (I/me/my) pronouncing his first name incorrectly.
67. Apparently his relatives insist on something that sounds like “Sinjun,” but (they/them/
their) demanding special pronunciation has backfired.
68. The editor-in-chief calls him “Sin” for short; speaking at a recent awards dinner, (she/her)
got a big laugh when she announced the nickname.
69. Do you think that St. John will appreciate (I/me/my) calling him “Johnny”?
70. I think that he will appoint (I/me/my) king of the newsroom.
Calling All Overachievers: Extra

Chapter 10: The Case of It (And Other Pronouns)
Answers to Pronoun Case Problems
a
I. The pronoun I is an actor, one of the subjects of the verb have (I have). Me is for objects.
Myself is only for emphasis (I myself) or for actions that bounce back on the subject (I told
myself not to stand under a tree during a thunderstorm!).
b
he. Who discovered? He discovered. He is a subject pronoun.
c
they. Someone has to do the solving referred to in the sentence. Therefore you need a subject
pronoun, they.
d
they, them. This sentence illustrates the difference between subject and object pronouns. In
the first parentheses, they is what you want because they should contact Matt. The pronoun they
does the action. In the second half of the sentence, he needs them, and them receives the action
from the verb needs.
e
he. Did I catch you here? If the sentence contains a comparison and some words are implied,
supply the missing words before choosing a pronoun. In sentence 5, Peyton is better . . . than he
is. After you throw in the verb is, you immediately see that you need a subject pronoun — he.
f
me, she. In the first part of the sentence, the pronoun receives the action (Peyton won’t tell
whom? Me.) In the second, you need someone to do the nodding, the subject pronoun she.
g
she. The tough part about this sentence is that the pronoun choice is camouflaged by other
words (Peyton’s friends and Lucy). If you isolate the pronoun, however, you see that it is she
who is obsessed with Martians. You need the subject pronoun. To add a technical grammatical
explanation — stop reading now before you die of boredom! — the subject is Peyton’s friends,
and Lucy and she forms an appositive to the subject. An appositive is always in the same case
as the word it matches.
h
she, they. Two parentheses, two subjects. The verbs have and will make need subjects; she and
they fill the bill.
i
I, ourselves. In the first part of the sentence, you need a subject for will glue. You can rule out
me because me is an object pronoun. The pronoun myself works only for emphasis, in which
case the sentence would read Elizabeth and I myself. In the second parentheses, you’re looking
for an object for the verb will glue. The pronoun we drops out right away because it’s for sub-
jects only. The next choice, us, is tempting, but because the actor and the receiver are the
same, ourselves is better.
j
him. Like sentence 7, this one has lots of camouflage. Cover everything between contacted 
and the pronoun choice. What’s left? Peyton just contacted he/him. Can you hear the correct
answer? Peyton contacted he? I don’t think so! You need the object pronoun him. If you really
want a grammatical explanation, and surely you have better things to do with your time, 
authorities is the object of the verb contacted, and Dan Moore and him forms an appositive.
An appositive is always in the same case as its equivalent.
k
us. Elizabeth is doing the action, and the pronoun’s on the receiving end. You can’t plug in we
because we is for subjects, and receivers are objects. Ourselves doesn’t fit because the -self 
pronouns are only for emphasis (we ourselves will go . . .) or for situations in which the actor
and receiver are the same (I told myself . . .).
l
she. A word is missing in this sentence: does. If you insert the missing word after the pronoun,
you’ll hear it: NASA knows a lot more than she does . . . . The pronoun she is the subject of the
implied verb does.

m
him. The verb offer, even in the infinitive form (to offer) takes the object pronoun him.
n
I or I myself. The first choice is an ordinary subject pronoun; the second is emphatic. Do you
want to scream this phrase or just say it? Your call.
o
she. A word is missing. After you supply it, you see what’s needed: No one is more dishonest
than Matt and she are. That last little verb tells you that you need a subject pronoun.
p
me. The object pronoun me receives the action from the verb told. You can probably “hear” the
correct answer if you use your thumb to cover the words Matt and. By isolating the pronoun,
you can quickly determine that Elizabeth told I is a nonstarter. Elizabeth told me sounds — and
is — correct.
q
we. In many comparisons, a word is missing. This sentence is easy if you insert the implied
word, are. Elizabeth is as suspicious as us are? Nope. Try again: Elizabeth is as suspicious as we
are. Bingo. The grammatical explanation is also simple: The implied verb are needs a subject
pronoun.
r
I. Here you need a subject pronoun for the verb were enrolled. The -self pronoun isn’t appropri-
ate because -self pronouns are only for emphasis or for actions that double back upon the sub-
ject, as in I told myself not to make a grammar mistake.
s
us. The object pronoun us receives the action of the verb gave in this sentence.
t
they. The verb are taking needs a subject, and they fills the bill.
u
who. Focus on the part of the sentence containing the who/whom issue: who/whom should get
the information. The verb should get needs a subject, so who is the proper choice.
v
whomever. The buyer is sending someone, so the pronoun you plug in receives the action of
sending. Receivers are always object pronouns, so whomever wins the prize.
w
Who. The verb is needs a subject, and who is a subject pronoun — a match made in heaven.
x
whoever. The verb believes needs a subject. Whoever is a subject pronoun.
y
whoever. This one is tricky. When you hear the word to (a preposition), you may want to 
jump for the object pronoun, because prepositions are completed by object pronouns such as
whomever. (Check out sentence 17, where whomever is the object of the preposition with.)
But in this sentence, the verb is needs a subject, and whoever fills that role. For those who dig
grammar (if you quake at the word, don’t read this part), the object of the preposition to is the
whole clause, whoever is willing to pay.
A
who. Somebody isn’t saying, so you need a subject pronoun. Who fills the bill.
B
whom. This sentence is easier to figure out if you isolate the part of the sentence containing
the who/whom choice: who/whom the expert consulted. Now rearrange those words into the
normal subject-verb order: the expert consulted whom. Whom is the object of the verb consulted.
C
whom. As in the previous sentence, isolating and rearranging are helpful: who/whom Matt saw,
Matt saw whom. The pronoun whom serves as the object of the verb saw.
D
whoever. The verb is needs a subject, so whoever has to do the job.
E
whom. Concentrate on the part of the sentence between the commas. Rearrange the words into
the normal subject-verb order: I do not trust who/whom. Now do you see that it has to be whom?
The pronoun I is the subject, and whom is acted upon, not an actor.
F
whom. The verb scolded needs an object, and the object pronoun whom does the job.
136
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

G
who. The verb have just has to have a subject (verbs are picky that way), so here you need who.
H
who. The verb can fake matches with the subject pronoun who in this sentence.
I
whoever. Did I fool you here? The preposition to needs an object, so at first glance whomever
looks like a winner. However, the verb is willing requires a subject, and that subject is whoever.
So what about the preposition? No sweat: The object of the preposition is the whole statement
(a clause, in grammatical terms) whoever is willing to listen.
J
whoever. The verb trusts can’t flap around without a subject, so you have to plug in whoever.
K
they. Okay, I know it doesn’t sound right, but you can reverse “the criminals are they” to get
“they are the criminals.” To put it another way: they is a subject pronoun and belongs after the
linking verb are.
L
them. To promise isn’t a linking verb; it expresses action. After an action verb you need an
object pronoun, and them fits the description.
M
she. The rightful owner is she, and she is the rightful owner. See how neatly that reverses?
N
I. The subject pronoun I belongs after the linking verb is.
O
he. It is he and he is it . . . in more ways than one! If Peyton points the FBI at Matt, he is certainly
it, as far as felony charges go. Speaking grammatically, I must point out that he is a subject pro-
noun and should appear after the linking verb is.
P
them. Telling is an action, so you need an object pronoun here, and them is an object pronoun.
Q
him. Drew is an action word that should be followed by an object pronoun such as him.
R
whoever. The verb can be is a linking verb, and whoever is a subject pronoun.
S
him. Peyton sings, rats, blabs, confesses, and tells, which is the action verb in this sentence and
which should be followed by an object pronoun.
T
he. The linking verb was is completed by the subject pronoun he.
U
her. The preposition to needs an object, and here it has two: Mom and her.
V
Me. The preposition Of has three objects, including Me.
W
me. The preposition between calls for two objects. In this sentence, Jessica is one and me is the
other. Don’t fall into the between-and-I trap; between calls for objects, not subjects.
X
he. I did warn you that I’m throwing in a subject here and there! The verb was is missing at 
the end of this sentence. When you throw it in, you hear that she was prettier than he was. The
missing word clarifies everything because you would never say that she was prettier than him
was. (Everyone knows that he once won an “Ugly as a Wart” contest!)
Y
her. The preposition after needs an object, and her takes that role.
z
him. Did you know that past may sometimes be a preposition? The object pronoun him works
well here.
Z
us, whoever. This is a hard one; if you got it right, you deserve an ice cream sundae. The pro-
noun us is best as an object of the preposition behind. But the preposition at is NOT completed
by the pronoun whomever. Instead, whoever functions as the subject of the verb comes. The
whole thing — whoever comes too close — is the object of the preposition at.
137
Chapter 10: The Case of It (And Other Pronouns)

1
whom. Change the question to a statement and you’ll get this one right away: This dog is
snarling at whom. The preposition at is completed by the object whom.
2
him. The preposition on needs an object, and him got the job.
3
them. Around is a preposition in this sentence, so it takes the object them.
4
him. The preposition to needs an object, so opt for him.
5
him. You can’t write to he, because he is a subject pronoun, and the preposition to can’t bear to
be without an object pronoun.
6
she. This sentence makes a comparison, and comparisons often contain implied verbs. The
missing word is does, as in Spike loves letters even more than she does. Once you include the
missing word, the answer is clear. You need she as a subject of the verb does.
7
whoever. The preposition from needs an object, but in this tricky sentence, the entire expres-
sion whoever really wants to catch his attention is the object, not just the first word. The pro-
noun whoever functions as the subject of the verb wants.
8
he. This implied comparison omits the verb is. Add the missing verb and the answer leaps off
the page: Jessica is as fond of meaty bones as he is. You need the subject pronoun he to match
with the verb is.
9
his. Lincoln doesn’t need help with a person; he needs help with a task (editing). Whose editing
is it? His.
0
their. Lincoln didn’t hate the people at the agency (except that guy with bad breath who called
him “Abe”). He didn’t love their sending pronoun-lovers. The possessive pronoun shifts the
focus to the action, where it should be.
!
him. I snuck this one in to see if you were awake. Lori saw him. What was he doing? Reading,
but the reading is a description tacked onto the main idea, which is that she saw him. A posses-
sive isn’t called for in this sentence.
@
her. The objection isn’t to a person (she) but to an action (insisting).
#
my. The point in this sentence is Lincoln’s reaction to the editing. The possessive pronoun my
keeps the reader’s attention on editing, not on me.
$
my. He didn’t hate me, he hated the way I said his name, which no one can ever pronounce
anyway. My ensures that the reader thinks about pronouncing.
%
their. They haven’t backfired; the say-it-my-way-or-take-the-highway attitude is the problem.
The possessive keeps you focused on demanding.
^
she. The expression inside the commas (speaking at a recent awards dinner) is just a descrip-
tion. Take it out for a moment and see what’s left: she got a big laugh. The pronoun she is the
one you want.
&
my. He does appreciate me, especially at bonus time. But in this sentence, I’m inquiring about
the calling. This -ing noun should be preceded by the possessive my.
*
me. The me is the focus here, not an action-oriented -ing noun. Also, the noun king wasn’t cre-
ated from a verb.

pronoun where an object pronoun is needed.

the reader’s attention on the taking, not on him.
[
whoever. The preposition for may have tempted you to opt for an object pronoun, but the verb
looks needs a subject, so whoever is best. The object of the preposition, by the way, is the whole
expression, whoever looks. . . .
{

ave you figured out that pronouns are the most annoying part of speech in the entire
universe? Pronouns are the words that stand in for nouns — words that name people,
places, things, and ideas. The language can’t do without pronouns, but when it comes to
error-potential, they’re a minefield just waiting to blow up your speech or writing.
I cover the basics of pronoun use in Chapter 3 and more advanced topics in Chapter 10. In
this chapter I hit the big time, supplying information about pronouns that your great-uncle,
the one who has a collection of antique grammar books that he actually reads, doesn’t even
know. If you master everything in this chapter, give yourself a gold pronoun . . . er, star.
Nodding in Agreement: Pronouns and
Possessives Come Head to Head
Pronouns substitute for nouns, but in a sincere effort to ruin your life, they also match up
with other pronouns. For example, take a look at this sentence: “When Charlie yelled at me,
I smacked him and poured glue on his homework.” The pronoun his refers to the pronoun
him, which stands in for the noun Charlie. This example sentence is fairly straightforward;
unfortunately, not all pronoun-pronoun couples get together so easily.
“Everybody is here.” Doesn’t that comment sound plural? So why do you need the singular
verb is? Because everybody is a singular pronoun. So are everyone, someone, anyone, no
one, somebody, anybody, nobody, everything, something, anything, nothing, each, either, and
neither. Chances are your ear for good English already knows that these pronouns belong in
the singular box.
If you extend the logic and match another pronoun — such as a possessive — to any of the
“every . . .,” “some . . .,” “any . . .,” and other similar pronouns, you may stub your toe. I
often hear sentences such as “Everyone needs their lunch pass” — a grammatical felony
because the singular everyone doesn’t agree with the plural their. And in the grammar
world, agreement (matching up all plurals with other plurals and singulars with other singu-
lars) is a Very Big Deal. To get out of the grammatical penitentiary, substitute his or her for
their: “Everyone needs his or her lunch pass.”

Not every pronoun is singular. Both, several, few, and many are plurals and may match
with their or other plural words.
Scan the following example sentence and practice exercises and plop a pronoun that
makes sense in each blank.
Q. Neither of my aunts has a wart on _______________ nose.
A. her. The singular pronoun neither must pair with another singular pronoun. True, the sen-
tence refers to aunts, a plural. But the word neither tells you that you’re talking about the
aunts individually, so you have to go with a singular pronoun. Because aunts are female,
her is the word you want.
1. My cousins may be easily found in a crowd because both have warts on _______________
noses.
2. My cousin Amy opted for surgery; relieved that the procedure went well, everybody sent
_______________ best wishes.
3. Many of the get-well cards sported miniature warts on _______________ envelopes.
4. A few even had little handwritten messages tucked into _______________ illustrations.
5. Because Amy is pleased with the result of her surgery, someone else in her family is going
to get _______________ nose done also.
6. “Doesn’t everyone need more warts on _______________ nose?” reasoned Amy.
7. Anybody who disagreed with Amy kept quiet, knowing that _______________ opinion
wouldn’t be accepted anyway.
8. Each of the implanted warts has _______________ own unique shape.
9. Several of Amy’s new warts model _______________ appearance on a facial feature of a
famous movie star.
10. Although someone said that _______________ didn’t like the new warts, the crowd reac-
tion was generally positive.
11. Neither of the surgeons who worked on Amy’s nose has opted for a similar procedure on
_______________ own schnozz.
12. I assume that nothing I say will change your mind about the nose-wart question;
_______________ will “go in one ear and out the other,” as my mother used to say.
13. Aftercare is quite extensive; not one of the warts will continue to look good unless Amy
gives _______________ a lot of attention.
14. Both Amy and her sister Emily look forward to having _______________ portraits painted,
warts and all.
15. Many will ask _______________ own doctors for cosmetic surgery after this event.
16. A few will opt for _______________ own version of “wart enhancement.”
17. Not everyone will want the same type of wart on _______________ nose.

Working for the Man: Pronouns for
Companies and Organizations
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), Sears Roebuck & Co., the United Nations,
and a ton of other businesses or community groups are waiting for the chance to
mess up your pronoun choices. How? They cleverly create names that sound plural,
and unsurprisingly, many people pair them up with plural pronouns. However, a
moment of logical thinking tells you that each is one business and must therefore be
referred to by a singular pronoun. Here’s what I mean:
Wrong: Saks Fifth Avenue has put their designer lingerie on sale.
Why it is wrong: I was there last week and the lingerie was full price. Also, the
pronoun their is plural, but Saks, despite the letter s at the end of the name, is sin-
gular because it’s one company.
Right: Saks sometimes puts its designer lingerie on sale.
Why it is right: Now the singular possessive pronoun (its) matches the singular
store name (Saks).
In the following example and set of practice exercises, choose the correct pronoun for
each sentence. Just to keep you alert, I mixed in a couple of sentences in which the
pronoun doesn’t refer to a singular company or organization. The same principle
applies: Singular matches with singular, and plural matches with plural.
Q. Carrie patronizes Meyer and Frank because (she/they) likes (its/their) shoe department,
which has a good supply of her favorite size-13 stiletto heels.
A. she, its. The first pronoun refers to Carrie, so she, a singular, matches nicely. Carrie is not
only singular, but also unique when it comes to shoe size. The second refers to the store,
which is singular also and thus merits the singular its.
21. Carrie, who is not noted for logical thinking, believes that the United Countries
Association should sell cookies to feed (its/their) “starving” staffers, even if the staffers
have been stuffing (itself/himself or herself/themselves) for years.
22. The World Health Maintenance Association (WHMA) answered Carrie’s letter with a sug-
gestion of (its/their) own.
23. “Please work locally to overcome starvation,” read the reply. “The WHMA will take care of
(its/their) own staff.”
24. Carrie, depressed by her failure to launch a cookie drive, immediately visited Mrs. Moo’s
Cookie World to sample (its/their) merchandise.
143

25. About 5,000 calories later, Carrie had completely drowned her sorrows and was ready to
take on the WHMA again. “The WHMA needs to do a better job with labor relations.
(It/They) won’t win!” she screamed.
26. Because her mouth was full at the time, Carrie choked on a bit of Macadamia Crunch,
which (she/it) had saved for last.
27. “I’ll sue Mrs. Moo’s Cookie World and all (its/their) subsidiaries,” vowed Carrie, after she
had been revived by a handsome emergency medical technician.
28. “Don’t sue the EMT service,” muttered the technician. “(It/They) can never get enough
funding.”
29. “I’m a supporter of the EMT service,” declared Carrie hoarsely because (she/it/they) still
had a bit of cookie in (her/its) throat.
30. The technician was so nervous around Carrie that he called the National Institute of
Health (NIH) to check (its/their) policy on impacted cookie crumbs.
31. The NIH wrote to the EMT service about the WHMA, and in (its/their) letter the NIH
requested additional information.
32. “The NIH cannot speak about individual cookie crumbs, but Mrs. Moo’s Cookie World did
report that macadamia nuts are (its/their) most popular ingredient,” read the letter.
33. Carrie’s response was to question the NIH about (its/their) integrity.
34. “I think that Mrs. Moo herself, the founder of Mrs. Moo’s Cookie World, has bribed the
NIH, and (it/they) will always rule in favor of those who contribute money,” said Carrie.
35. Mrs. Moo, distressed at Carrie’s accusation, ate 12 cookies to calm herself; (it/they) were
delicious.
Decoding Who, That, and Which
Most pronouns are either singular or plural, masculine or feminine or neuter, popular
or unpopular, good at math or barely passing arithmetic. Okay, I went a little too far,
but you get the point. The characteristics of most pronouns are fixed. But a couple 
of pronouns change from singular to plural (or back) and from masculine to feminine
without a moment’s pause. Who, which, and that take their meaning and characteris-
tics from the sentences in which they appear. Here’s what I mean:
May, who was born in April, wants to change her name. (The who is feminine and
singular because it replaces the feminine, singular May.)
Her sisters, who were named after their birth months of June and August, support
May’s changes. (The who is feminine and plural because it replaces sisters.)
A change in the meaning of who, which, or that would be an interesting but useless
fact except for one issue. Whether a subject pronoun is singular or plural affects what
sort of verb (singular or plural) is paired with it. In the preceding sample sentences,
the who is paired with was when the who represents May and with were when the who
represents sisters.
144
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

Deciding singular/plural verb issues is especially tough sometimes:
She is one of the few quarterbacks who (is/are) ready for prime time.
She is the only quarterback who (is/are) negotiating with the Jets.
Leaving aside the issue of a female quarterback (hey, it could happen!), the key to this
sort of sentence is deciding what the pronoun represents. If who means she, then of
course you opt for a singular verb because she is a singular pronoun. But if who
means quarterbacks, the verb should be plural, because quarterbacks is plural. Logic
tells you the answers:
She is one of the few quarterbacks who are ready for prime time.
She is the only quarterback who is negotiating with the Jets.
How many are ready for prime time? A few quarterbacks are ready — you football fans
can make the list — and she’s one of them. The who in the first example clearly stands
in for quarterbacks, a plural. In the second example just one person is negotiating — she.
Therefore, who is singular and so is the verb paired with it.
Catch as many correct verbs as you can in the following example sentence and practice
exercises. I promise that at least one of each pair in parentheses is what you want.
Q. Kristin is one of the many lawyers on the fishing boat who (want/wants) to catch a shark.
A. want. How many lawyers want to catch a shark, according to this sentence? One or more
than one? The sentence tells you that quite a lot of lawyers are in that category, so the
who stands in for the group of lawyers. Bingo: A plural verb is needed to match the 
plural who.
36. The shark that Kristin caught was the only one that (was/were) hungry enough to take the
odd bait that Kristin offered.
37. The bait that (was/were) on sale at the market when Kristin went shopping was extremely
cheap (just like Kristin herself).
38. “I know that there is at least one shark that (likes/like) peanut butter,” reasoned Kristin.
39. Kristin’s fellow shark fans, who (sails/sail) even in the winter, read a lot about these ani-
mals on the Internet.
40. The only one of the shark sites that (doesn’t/don’t) appeal to Kristin is the one sponsored
by the Stop Fishing Society.
41. Could it be that Kristin is one of the shark fans who (believes/believe) the Great White is a
vegetarian?
42. Why did Kristin choose a bait that (is/are) completely unappetizing when dunked in salt
water?
43. One of the many experienced sailors who (was/were) laughing at Kristin’s bait exclaimed,
“Peanut butter can’t catch anything!”
44. I’m going to take Kristin’s shark to the only taxidermist that (is/are) willing to stuff such a
catch.
45. In the mouth of the shark he is planning to mount a jar of one of the many brands of
peanut butter that (is/are) shark-friendly.

Chapter 11: Choosing the Best Pronoun for a Tricky Sentence

Getting Down to Specifics: Avoiding
Improper Pronoun References
Pronoun rules are far more rigid than even the U.S. tax code. The underlying princi-
ple, that one pronoun may replace one and only one matching noun, bends only a tiny
bit by allowing they, for instance, to take the place of more than one name. (Ida, Mary,
and Joan, for example, may be replaced by they.) In common, informal speech and
writing, pronouns are sometimes sent to fill other roles. But if you’re going for cor-
rect, formal English, don’t ask a pronoun to violate the rules.
A common error is to ask a pronoun to stand in for an idea expressed by a whole sen-
tence or paragraph. (Pronouns can’t replace verbs or noun/verb combos.) The pro-
nouns that, which, and this are often misused in this way.
Wrong: Jeffrey handed in a late, error-filled report, which annoyed his boss.
Why it’s wrong: The pronoun which improperly refers to the whole sentence. In
formal English the pronoun has to replace one and only one noun.
Right: Jeffrey’s report, which annoyed his boss, was late and error-filled. (Now
which refers to report, a noun.)
Also right: The fact that Jeffrey’s report was late and error-filled annoyed his
boss. (Sometimes the best way to fix one of these sentences is to eliminate the
pronoun entirely.)
Another common mistake is to send in a pronoun that approaches, but doesn’t
match, the noun it’s replacing:
Wrong: Jeffrey’s sports marketing course sounds interesting, but I don’t want to
be one.
Why it’s wrong: One what? Sports marketing course? I don’t think so. The one
replaces sports marketer (or sports marketing executive), but the sentence has no
noun to match one.
Right: Jeffrey’s sports marketing course sounds interesting, but I don’t want to
enroll in it. (Now it replaces sports marketing — a better match.)
Also right: Jeffrey is studying to become a sports marketer, but I don’t want to be
one. (Now one replaces sports marketer.)
Fix the pronoun problem in the following example sentence and practice exercises.
Some are correct as written. When you find one, write “correct” in the blank. Rewrite
the clunkers so that every pronoun refers to an appropriate noun. Remember that
sometimes you have to dump the pronoun entirely in order to correct the mistake.
Note: The incorrect sentences have more than one answer; in the following example, I
show you two possibilities, but in the answers section of this chapter, I provide only
one possible answer.
Q. Jeffrey’s dream job features a corner office, three-hour lunches, and frequent “research”
junkets to Tahiti, which is unlikely given that he has no skill whatsoever.

A. Given that he has no skill whatsoever, Jeffrey is unlikely to get his dream job, which
features a corner office, three-hour lunches, and frequent “research” junkets to Tahiti.
The preceding sentence is just one possible solution, in which the pronoun which takes
the place of job. Here’s another: The fact that Jeffrey has no skill whatsoever makes his
dream job, which features a corner office, three-hour lunches, and frequent “research”
junkets to Tahiti, unlikely. Any sentence that achieves the goal of one noun out, one pro-
noun in is fine. The original doesn’t work because which replaces an entire sentence,
Jeffrey’s dream job features a corner office, three-hour lunches, and frequent “research” jun-
kets to Tahiti.

Field Trip Report, 1/18/12
I left school at 10:03 a.m. with 45 freshmen, all of whom were excited about 
our visit to Adventure Land. The day passed without incident, which was a 
great relief to me. I sat in the Adventure Land Bar and Grille for five hours 
while the youngsters visited Space Camp, Pirates’ Mountain, and other 
attractions that are overrated but popular. The group saw me eating and 
said they wanted one too, but I replied that everyone had their school-
issued lunch. This was a disappointment, and several students threw them 
at me. We got on one of the vans that was overdue for maintenance. The 
motor whirred loudly, and it scared the van driver. We drove to Makoski 
Brake and Wheel Repairs because the driver said their expertise was what 
we needed. Makoski is also the only one of the many repair shops on Route 
9 that take credit cards, which was helpful because I had spent all my 
money in the Adventure Land Bar and Grille.

Chapter 11: Choosing the Best Pronoun for a Tricky Sentence

Answers to Advanced Pronoun Problems
a
their. The plural pronoun both matches with the plural possessive pronoun their.
b
his or her. Technically you can answer “his best wishes” and be grammatically correct, but I
always opt for the more inclusive term “his or her.” Don’t pair the plural their with the singular
everyone because singular and plural don’t socialize in the grammar world.
c
their. The plural pronoun many is a good mate for the plural possessive their.
d
their. The pronoun few is plural, and so is their. A fine pair — they may even get married!
e
his or her. The singular possessive his or her links up nicely with the singular someone.
f
his or her. Once again you’re matching a possessive with the singular pronoun everyone.
g
his or her. The singular pronoun anybody must be paired with a singular possessive pronoun
(or two, for gender fairness), so go for his or her.
h
its. Yes, the sentence refers to warts, but the each indicates that you’re talking about one wart
at a time. The singular each matches the singular possessive pronoun its.
Don’t confuse the possessive pronoun its with the shortened form of it is (it’s). The possessive
has no apostrophe.
i
their. The pronoun several moves you into plural territory, where their rules.
j
he or she. The pronoun someone is singular (notice the one inside the word?) and must pair
with the singular he or she.
k
his or her. If you know that the surgeons are both men (or both women), use one of the singu-
lar pronouns (either his or her). Absent gender knowledge, go for the inclusive his or her (writ-
ing both singular pronouns). No matter what, don’t opt for the plural their because neither is
singular.
l
it. The singular nothing pairs with the singular pronoun it in this sentence.
m
it. The singular not one needs the singular itself.
n
their. The plural pronoun both tells you that the girls are springing for two portraits. It also tells
you that you need the plural pronoun their.
o
their. The pronoun many is plural, so their is the best choice.
p
their. The pronoun few is plural and matches with the plural pronoun their.
q
his or her. The pronoun everyone, like all the -one pronouns, is singular and must be matched by
a singular pronoun. Because the gender is not specified, his or her allows for both possibilities.
r
her. The pronoun neither is singular, and the sentence concerns two females, Elizabeth’s daugh-
ters. Hence her, a singular feminine pronoun, is what you want here.
s
their. The plural possessive pronoun their refers to many stars, a plural.
t
it. This sentence is tricky. True, the sentence talks about warts, and warts is a plural. However,
the pronoun each is singular and has means that the group of warts is being considered one at
a time. Therefore you need a singular pronoun, it, to match with each.
150
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

u
its, themselves. In the first part of the sentence, the possessive pronoun refers to the organiza-
tion, the United Countries Association. Because the organization is singular, it should be matched
with a singular possessive, its. In the second part of the sentence, the pronoun refers to the
individual staffers, who like to chow down and party hearty. Because lots of staffers are stuff-
ing, themselves is the best choice.
v
its. The possessive pronoun refers to the WHMA, a singular organization. The singular pronoun
is the one you want.
w
its. I know, I know. The word that sounds correct here is their. Unfortunately, the correct word is
its, the singular pronoun that matches the singular organization.
x
its. Mrs. Moo’s Cookie World is one business, so it must pair with the singular its.
y
It. Use your logic. Carrie is referring to the WHMA, and thus it is appropriate. If she were refer-
ring to the staff or to the administration, they would work.
A
she. The singular feminine pronoun she refers to Carrie, a singular female.
B
its. The company is singular, so pronouns referring to it must also be singular.
C
It. The service is singular (and the technician, I happen to know, is also single). The singular
possessive works well here.
D
she, her. These two pronouns refer to Carrie, so singular and feminine rule.
E
its. The organization’s name implies a plural, but in reality a singular entity is referenced, and
its matches up correctly.
F
its. The National Institute of Health, an organization that in real life has never done anything
remotely like the actions in this exercise, should be referred to with the singular pronoun its in
this sentence.
G
its. Mrs. Moo’s Cookie World is one business, so its, the singular pronoun, is best.
H
its. To refer to the organization, use the singular pronoun its.
I
it. The NIH, an organization, takes the singular pronoun it.
J
they. This pronoun refers to the 12 cookies that Mrs. Moo scarfed down. Twelve cookies is a
plural, so the plural pronoun they makes a match.
K
was. The clue here is the only one. Not all, or even some, sharks would take Kristin’s unusual
bait. Only one was hungry enough. The pronoun that is singular.
L
was. The pronoun that replaces bait, a singular word that must match with the singular was.
M
likes. Now Kristin is talking about one shark, and the pronoun that is singular.
N
sail. The pronoun who refers to fans, so the who is plural and takes a plural verb, sail.
O
doesn’t. The only tells you that the pronoun that is singular and is therefore desperate for a sin-
gular verb, doesn’t. Okay, not desperate, but you get the idea.
P
believe. She’s not the only one; she’s one out of a crowd. The people in the crowd believe.
Q
is. The pronoun that represents bait, so that is singular and takes the singular verb is.
151
Chapter 11: Choosing the Best Pronoun for a Tricky Sentence

R
were. How many people are doubled over in mirth? Not just one. (Knowing Kristin, I’d guess
thousands.) The who is plural, as is its verb, were.
S
is. Just one taxidermist, so singular is the way to go.
T
are. Strange as it may sound, more than one brand of peanut butter is shark-friendly (no sharks
were harmed in the grinding or bottling operation). Bingo, you need a plural.
U
Jeffrey jogged for an hour in an effort to work off the pounds he had gained during his last
three-hour lunch, without success. The easiest way to fix the pronoun problem (in the original
sentence, this incorrectly refers to a complete sentence, not to a single noun) is to eliminate
this. You can dump this with any number of rewrites, including the one given here.
V
He’s always admired the superhero with flat abs, but no matter how hard he tries, he can’t
be one. Now the pronoun one refers to superhero. In the original, the noun superhero doesn’t
appear, just the possessive superhero’s, which doesn’t match the nonpossessive pronoun one.
W
correct. The pronoun that replaces one word: sit-ups.
X
The fact that Jeffrey’s next fitness effort ended in disaster did not discourage him. Eliminate
the pronoun and you eliminate the problem, which is the pronoun that. That may not refer, as it
does in the original sentence, to a whole sentence (Jeffrey’s next fitness effort ended in disaster).
Y
As a temporary solution, he simply ignored the arrest warrant and continued to run. The
pronoun this needs a one-word reference, but in the original, this replaces everything that
appears before the semicolon. As usual, an easy fix is to rewrite without a pronoun.
z
correct. Surprised? The pronoun which refers to sonnets. One word out and one in: You’re okay.
Z
The great poet inspired Jeffrey to study poetry also. In the original, no one can figure out
what it means. The solution is to insert a noun (poetry) and dump the pronoun.
1
“No, I did not see the car when I directed my bicycle into the street,” testified Jeffrey, “but
my distraction wasn’t the cause of the accident.” One possible fix is to cut that and insert a
specific. I’ve chosen distraction, but you may select blindness, lack of awareness, or something
similar.
2
correct. The pronoun which refers to phone, a legal use.
3
The judge was not impressed by Jeffrey’s testimony and fined him, and Jeffrey paid the
$500. Okay, pick any amount you want, so long as you dump the it. Why is it illegal? The origi-
nal sentence has no fine, just the verb fined. A pronoun replaces a noun, not a verb.
4
When Jeffrey paid the fine, he was impressed by the court clerk, who quoted Shakespeare.
The problem here is the pronoun which. In the original sentence, the which refers to the fact
that the court clerk spouted sonnets while Jeffrey counted out his money. In my suggested
rewrite, I drop the which altogether.
5
“I see you are a sonneteer,” commented Jeffrey as he smiled and gave the clerk a romantic
look; she was not impressed by Jeffrey’s efforts at all. The original sentence contains a vague
pronoun (this). You can eliminate this vagueness in a couple of different ways; just write a noun
instead of this and you’re all set.
6
“Please pay your fine and leave the room,” she roared, flattening Jeffrey’s hopes for a
Saturday night date. Jeffrey has no reason to hope for a Saturday night date (unless he signs
up for some sort of television makeover show). You have plenty of reason to hope for proper
pronoun usage. Simply rewrite the sentence to omit the vague pronoun that.
152
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

7
The clerk wisely never dates anyone from work. You can eliminate the vague pronoun which
in several different ways. Another possible correction: The clerk’s policy never to date anyone
from work is wise.
8
The clerk quotes poetry because she’s hoping to become a literary critic; Jeffrey majored in
literary criticism in college, so in theory he is a good match for her. In reality, they would hit
the divorce court within a month, but the problem with the original sentence is the pronoun,
not Jeffrey’s romance. In the original sentence it refers to nothing. Jeffrey didn’t major in literary
critic (the expression in the original); he majored in literary criticism, an expression that
replaces it in the corrected sentence.
9
In the original sentence, which refers to the fact that the day passed without incident. The pro-
noun can’t replace an entire sentence. One possible fix: “The fact that the day passed . . . was a
great relief to me.”

One what? The pronoun has no noun to refer to, just the verb eating. Reword to add some food
(“. . . saw me eating an ice cream cone”) and the one will make sense.
!
The pronoun everyone is singular, so it must be paired with his or her, not their.
@
The pronoun this needs one noun to replace, not a whole sentence. Eliminate the pronoun with
something like “The lunch packs were a . . . at me.”

Field Trip Report, 1/18/12
I left school at 10:03 a.m. with 45 freshmen, all of whom were excited about 
our visit to Adventure Land. The day passed without incident, which was a 
great relief to me. I sat in the Adventure Land Bar and Grille for five hours 
while the youngsters visited Space Camp, Pirates’ Mountain, and other 
attractions that are overrated but popular. The group saw me eating and said 
they wanted one too, but I replied that everyone had their his or her 
school-issued lunch. This was a disappointment, and several students threw 
them at me. We got on one of the vans that was were overdue for mainte-
nance. The motor whirred loudly, and it scared the van driver. We drove to 
Makoski Brake and Wheel Repairs because the driver said their its exper-
tise was what we needed. Makoski is also the only one of the many repair 
shops on Route 9 that take takes credit cards, which was helpful because I 
had spent all my money in the Adventure Land Bar and Grille.

Chapter 11: Choosing the Best Pronoun for a Tricky Sentence

#
In the original, the pronoun them refers to nothing. Add “lunch packs” or “sandwiches” and
you’re in business.
$
The sentence should read “one of the vans that were,” not “one of the vans that was.” The pro-
noun that is a stand-in for vans.
%
What does it mean? The motor didn’t scare the driver; the whirring sound scared him. But it
should replace a noun. Fix this problem by saying that “the driver was scared” or a similar
statement.
^
Their shouldn’t refer to a company. Try its.
&
This sentence should say that it was “the only one of the many that takes.” When you get into
“only one of ____” territory, you know that the pronoun is singular and needs a singular verb.
*
What does which mean? The fact that the repair shop takes credit cards! The pronoun can’t
replace all those words. Rewrite to eliminate the pronoun with something like “Makoski’s
acceptance of credit cards was helpful because. . . .”

Verb-Tense Situations
In This Chapter
 Choosing the proper tense to summarize speech
 Expressing unchangeable facts in the correct verb tense
 Putting events in order with verbals
I
’ve always been attracted to sci-fi movies in which the heroes move around through the
millennia. I probably like fiddling with verb tense for exactly the same reason; standard
English verbs allow writers and speakers to time travel. You may not have a chief engineer
to warn you when the motor’s about to overheat, but you do have this chapter, which allows
you to practice some tricky verb-tense situations. For example, did Arthur say that he has
or had a cold? Did or does Mars qualify as a planet? And what effect do verbals — hybrid
forms that are half verb, half another part of speech — have on the timing of events in a sen-
tence? If you’re sure of all these issues, drop the book and play a round of miniature golf. If
you’re not completely certain, try your hand at these exercises.
Telling Tales of the Past
Humans love to gossip, so I’m betting that your lunch table is filled with a ton of stories,
many of which include summaries of what others have said or written. Because you’re
telling (actually, retelling) something that already happened, your base of operations is past
tense. Note the past-tense verbs in italics:
She caught Arthur with Stella, but he told her that he was only tying Stella’s bow tie and
not nibbling her neck. Then she said that Arthur brought her a box of candy with a note
saying that no one else had eyes like hers.
What’s wrong with the preceding example? Apart from the fact that Arthur was indeed nib-
bling Stella’s neck, nothing. The verb tenses are all in the past because that’s where a sum-
mary of speech resides. So even if she still has incomparable eyes, in this paragraph the
verb had is better. (One important exception to the stay-in-past-tense-for-speech-summary
rule is explained in the next section, “The Unchanging Universe: When You’re Stuck in the
Present.”)
A common error is to switch from one tense to another with no valid reason. I often hear
statements such as this one (the verbs are italicized):
So she sat home and waited for the phone to ring. He finally called. Then he says that the
big dance is a waste of time and they will skip the whole thing!

Penalty box. If she sat and waited until he called (all past-tense verbs), the next three
verbs (says, is, and will skip) should be in past tense also (said, was, and would skip).
Take a crack at selecting the right verb from the choices in parentheses — circle your
answer. Just to be sure you’re paying attention, I sneak in a few verbs that aren’t sum-
mary of speech and therefore shouldn’t be in past tense.
Q. During yesterday’s tryouts for the new reality show, Grammarian Idol Factor, Roberta
(tells/told/will tell) the producer that she (likes/liked/will like) selecting pronouns 
while dangling 200 feet above the ground.
A. told, liked. The first answer is easy. If the tryouts were yesterday, the fact that Roberta
lied to the producer (she actually hates pronouns) has to be in past tense. Told is past
tense. The second part is trickier. She may always “like” selecting pronouns, but in sum-
mary of speech, past tense is the way to go (with one exception, which I note in the next
section of this chapter).
1. The director of the show, Grammarian Idol Factor, explained to the candidates that he
(has/had/will have) to select a maximum of 30 contestants.
2. Most of the contestants eagerly replied that they (want/wanted/would want) to make 
the final 30.
3. Roberta, who (likes/like/had liked) to play hard to get, screamed at the director that he
(doesn’t/didn’t) have the faintest idea how to select the best applicants.
4. One who didn’t make the cut, Michael Hooper, told me that Roberta (is/was/had been) 
the clear winner of the first three challenges — the noun toss, the pronoun shuffle, and
the verb race.
5. Michael also whispered something surprising: Roberta (fails/failed/had failed) the 
psychological screening.
6. Last week when the psychologist (asks/asked) Roberta her feelings about various parts of
speech, Roberta said that the linking verbs (do/did) present a problem.
7. “Why (don’t/didn’t) you like linking verbs?” continued the psychologist.
8. Roberta explained that any form of the verb to be (annoys/annoyed) her.
9. “I (try/tried) to avoid any sentence with that sort of verb,” added Roberta.
10. She went on to say that adjectives (are/were/had been) her favorite part of speech.
11. The psychologist later reported that he (is/was/had been) worried about Roberta’s reac-
tion to punctuation.
12. Roberta apparently said that commas (are/were/had been) “out to get her.”
13. She added that exclamation points (threaten/threatened/had threatened) her also.
14. The psychologist complained that quotation marks (hem/hemmed) him in and (make/
made) him feel trapped.
15. Roberta and the psychologist disagreed, however, when Roberta said that the semicolon
(is/was) the best punctuation mark.
156
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

16. The director said that he (doesn’t/didn’t) know what to make of Roberta’s punctuation
obsession.
17. He declared that she (is/was) too unstable for a show that relies heavily on question marks.
18. The assistant director, on the other hand, whispered that Roberta (is/was) faking a punc-
tuation phobia just to attract attention.
19. The camera operator added that he (knows/knew) many people who (are/were) truly ter-
rified by commas and apostrophes.
20. In the final report on Roberta, the psychologist mentioned that she (is/was/had been)
afraid of punctuation because of a childhood attack by a mad copy editor.
The Unchanging Universe: When 
You’re Stuck in the Present
Verb tenses express the march of time: past, present, and future actions. But some things
don’t march; they stay in one, unchanging state forever. When you talk about these things,
present tense is the only one that makes sense, no matter what else is going on in the sen-
tence. Take a look at these examples:
Wrong: Marty told me that the earth was a planet.
Why it is wrong: What is the earth now, a bagel? The unchanging fact, that the
earth is a planet, must be expressed in present tense, despite the fact that all
other summarized speech should be in past tense. (See “Telling Tales of the Past,”
the previous section in this chapter, for more information.)
Right: Marty told me that the earth is a planet.
Choose the correct verb from the parentheses in the following sentences. To complicate your
life, I mixed “eternal truths” with changeable information. The eternal truths get present
tense no matter what, but with the other stuff . . . you’re on your own.
Q. Although Marty knew that 10 plus 10 (equals/equaled) 20, she wrote “15” on the test as a
gesture of defiance.
A. equals. In our number system (I’m not sure what they do on Mars), 10 added to 10 
makes 20. No change is possible, so present tense is what you want here.
21. Marty’s job as a schoolteacher won’t last very long if she keeps telling her class that each
molecule of water (has/had) three oxygen atoms.
22. Science has never been Marty’s best subject, but she did explain that water (covers/
covered) nine tenths of the planet.
23. I gently confronted her with the fact that land (makes/made) up about a quarter of the
earth’s surface.
24. Marty sniffed and said that she (has/had) a cold and couldn’t think about the earth
anyway.
25. We went out for a snack (bagels and cream cheese), and Marty told me that cheese (is/
was) a dairy product.
157
Chapter 12: Traveling in Time: Tricky Verb-Tense Situations

26. “Not the way they make it here,” I replied, pointing out that the product (is/was) mostly
artificial.
27. Did anyone actually like guar gum, I wondered, and why (is/was) it on my bagel, pretend-
ing to be cheese?
28. Marty put on her best science teacher’s voice and intoned, “Dairy produce (comes/came)
from milk.”
29. “Do you know that guar gum (is/was) not naturally found in dairy?” I asked.
30. Marty shook her head and began to compute the tip, muttering that twenty percent of ten
dollars (is/was) two dollars.
31. Ten years ago I took Marty to a restaurant that served only peanut butter, which (is/was)
made from nuts.
32. Marty used to be a big fan of jelly, though she never liked strawberries because they
(have/had) seeds.
33. Marty is such a fanatic about seeds that she once counted all the seeds on a strawberry
before she ate it; there (are/were) 45.
34. Marty was very critical of the cuisine, even though she (knows/knew) almost nothing
about cooking.
35. Marty at the time was following a vegetarian diet, which (does/did) not include meat.
Tackling the Timeline: Verbals to the Rescue
In Chapter 1 I explain the basic and “perfect” tenses of verbs (past, present, future,
past perfect, present perfect, and future perfect). Here I drop you into a vat of boiling
grammar as you choose the best tense for some complicated elements called verbals.
Verbals, as the name implies, have a link with verbs, but they also have a link with
other parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, and adverbs). Verbals never act as the verb
in a sentence, but they do influence the sense of time that the sentence conveys. The
three types of verbals are as follows:
 Gerunds look like the -ing form of a verb but function as a noun; that is, a gerund
names a person, place, thing, or idea. (“I like smiling,” commented Alice, who had
just had her braces removed. In this sentence, smiling is a gerund.)
 Infinitives are what you get when you add “to” to a verb. Infinitives may function
as nouns or they may take a descriptive role. (“To be safe, Alice packed a few
hundred rolls of breath mints.” In this sentence, to be is an infinitive.)
 Participles are the -ing or -ed or -en form of a verb, plus a few irregulars. They’re
also the form of the verb that joins up with has, have, or had. Participles
describe, often explaining what action someone is doing, but they never function
as the actual verb in a sentence. (“Inhaling sharply, Elaine stepped away from the
blast of peppermint that escaped from Alice’s mouth.” In this sentence, inhaling
is a participle giving information about Elaine. The verb is stepped.)
All three verbals give time information. The plain form (without has, have, having, or
had) shows action happening at the same time as the action expressed by the main
verb in the sentence. The perfect form (with has, have, having, or had) places the
action expressed by the verbal before the action of the main verb.
158
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

The tricky part about choosing either the plain or perfect form is to decide whether the
events are actually simultaneous, at least in the grammatical sense. First, figure out how
important the timeline is. If the events are so closely spaced so as not to matter, go for the
plain form. If it matters to the reader/listener that one event followed or will follow another,
go for a perfect form.
Circle the correct verbal form from the parentheses in this example. In the practice exer-
cises that follow, get out your time machine and read about a fictional tooth whitener
called “GreenTeeth” — sure, the content is strange, but all that you need to worry about is
whether you circle the correct verbal form.
Q. (Perfecting/Having perfected) the new product, the chemists asked the boss to conduct
some market research.
A. Having perfected. The two events occurred in the past, with the chemists’ request 
closer to the present moment. The event expressed by the verbal (a participle, if you
absolutely have to know) attributes another action to the chemists. The perfect form
(having tells you you’re in perfect-land) places the act of perfecting prior to the action
expressed by the main verb in the sentence, asked.
36. (Peering/Having peered) at each interview subject, the researchers checked for 
discoloration.
37. One interview subject shrieked upon (hearing/having heard) the interviewer’s comment
about “teeth as yellow as sunflowers.”
38. (Refusing/Having refused) to open her mouth, she glared silently at the interviewer.
39. With the market research on GreenTeeth (completed/having been completed), the team
tabulated the results.
40. The tooth whitener (going/having gone) into production, no further market research is
scheduled.
41. The researchers actually wanted (to interview/to have interviewed) 50 percent more sub-
jects after GreenTeeth’s debut, but the legal department objected.
42. Additional interviews will be scheduled if the legal department succeeds in (getting/
having gotten) participants to sign a “will not sue” pledge.
43. “(Sending/Having sent) GreenTeeth to the stores means that I am sure it works,” said 
the CEO.
44. (Weeping/Having wept), the interviewers applauded the boss’s comment.
45. Next year’s Product Placement Awards (being/having been) announced, the GreenTeeth
team is celebrating its six nominations and looking for future dental discoveries.

Time: 1:10 a.m.
Place: Loading dock 
Guard on duty: P. Samuels
(Proceeding, Having proceeded) from the locker room where Grammarian Idol Factor was on 
television, I noticed smoke (coming, having come) from a doorway that leads to the loading 
dock. (Knowing, Having known) that no deliveries were scheduled, I immediately became 
suspicious and took out my two-way radio. I alerted the other guard on duty, M. Faulkner, that 
trouble might be brewing. Faulkner, not (turning, having turned) off the television, couldn’t hear 
me. Upon (screaming, having screamed) into the radio that I needed him right away, I crept up 
to the door.
I noticed that the smoke was not hot. As I waited, (touching, having touched) the door to see 
whether it was getting hot, I sincerely wished (to find, to have found) Faulkner and (to strangle, 
to have strangled) him for not (replying, having replied) when I called. (Arriving, Having 
arrived), Faulkner apologized and explained that the adverb competition (is, was, had been) 
his favorite. He also said that he (has, had) a clogged ear that he (has, had) not been able to 
clean out, no matter how many toothpicks he (uses, used).
“(Speaking, Had spoken) of heating up,” I remarked, “I don’t sense any heat from this door.” I 
reminded him that fire (is, was) hot, and where there’s smoke (there is, there was) fire. Then 
Faulkner and I, (hearing, having heard) a buzz from the other side of the door, ran for shelter. I 
told Faulkner that the buzz (is, was) not from a bomb, but neither of us (being, having been) in 
the mood to take chances, we headed for the locker room. We did not put the television on 
again, Grammarian Idol Factor (being, having been) over for more than ten minutes, but we did 
plug in a CD as we waited for the police to arrive, (calling, having called) them some time 
before. Therefore we didn’t hear the director yell, “Cut!” In no way did we intend (to disrupt, 
to have disrupted) the film crew’s work or (to ruin, to have ruined) the dry ice that caused the 
“smoke.” (Respecting, Having respected) Hollywood for many years, Faulkner and I wish Mr.

Chapter 12: Traveling in Time: Tricky Verb-Tense Situations
Answers to Advanced Verb Tense Problems
a
had. The tip-off is the verb explained, which tells you that you’re summarizing speech. Go for
the past tense had.
b
wanted. Replied is a clue that you’re summarizing speech, so wanted, the past tense, is best.
The last choice, by the way, imposes a condition (he would do something under certain circum-
stances). Because the sentence doesn’t impose a condition, that choice isn’t appropriate.
c
likes, didn’t. The first choice has nothing to do with summary of speech and is a simple state-
ment about Roberta. The present tense works nicely in this spot. The second choice is a
speech summary (well, a scream summary, but the same rule applies), so the past-tense verb
didn’t fills the bill.
d
was. The sentence tells you that Michael Hooper told. The past tense works here for summary
of speech.
e
failed. You can arrive at the answer in two separate ways. If Michael whispered, the sentence is
summarizing what he said. Another way to look at this sentence is to reason that Michael is
telling you something that already happened, not something happening in the present moment.
Either way, the past tense failed is best.
f
asked, did. The first answer comes from the fact that the psychological test was in the past.
The second is summary of speech (Roberta’s words) and calls for past tense.
g
don’t. Give yourself a pat on the back if you got this one. The quotation marks indicate that the
words are exactly what the psychologist said. The speech isn’t summarized; it’s quoted. The
present tense makes sense here because the tester is asking Roberta about her state of mind 
at the current moment.
h
annoyed. Straight summary of speech here, indicated by the verb explained. Therefore, past
tense is the one you want.
i
try. This statement isn’t a summary, but rather a direct quotation from Roberta. She’s speaking
about her current actions, so present tense fits.
j
were. Roberta’s comments are summarized, not quoted, so past tense is appropriate.
k
was. The psychologist may still be worried (I would be, if I were treating Roberta!), but the sum-
mary of what he said should be in simple past tense.
l
were. The parentheses contain two past-tense verbs, were and had been. The had form is used
to place one event further in the past than another, a situation that isn’t needed here, when
you’re simply summarizing what someone is saying and not placing events in order. Go for
simple past tense.
m
threatened. Roberta’s remark about exclamation points is summarized speech calling for past
tense.
n
hemmed, made. The psychologist’s comments should, like all summarized speech, be reported
in simple past tense.
o
was. I like semicolons too, though I hesitate to say that they’re the best. Whatever I say about
them, however, must be summarized in simple past tense.

162
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 
p
didn’t. “The director said” is your cue to chime in with simple past tense, because you’re
reporting his speech.
q
was. “He declared” tells you that you’re reporting what he said. Thus, past tense is the way 
to go.
r
was. The word whispered is the key here because it indicates summarized speech, which calls
for simple past tense.
s
knew, were. Your intuition may point you toward present tense in this sentence because the
camera operator may still be hanging around with people who can’t handle punctuation marks.
However, summarized speech needs past tense.
t
was. Regardless of how long Roberta’s fearful state lasts, go for past tense to indicate summa-
rized speech.
u
has. The composition of a molecule doesn’t change, no matter how wrong Marty is about the
number of oxygen atoms (the actual number is two). Present tense is called for here.
v
covers. Marty has apparently tried to change the amount of water on the planet (from three
quarters to nine tenths), but in reality the amount of water is constant and thus merits present
tense.
w
makes. The amount of land doesn’t change; go with present tense.
x
had. Colds come and go; they aren’t unchangeable conditions. The summary of speech rule
doesn’t change. Past tense is what you want. (See the section, “Telling Tales of the Past,” earlier
in this chapter, for more detail.)
y
is. For once, Marty is correct. Cheese is a dairy product and can’t change into anything else.
For an eternal truth, present tense is correct.
A
was. Product composition can change, and the speaker is summarizing what was said. Past
tense makes sense.
B
was. The guar gum’s location on the bagel doesn’t fall into the eternal truth category, and the
speaker is talking about the past. The past-tense verb was is the one you want.
C
comes. The definition of dairy doesn’t change, so present tense works best here.
D
is. This directly quoted remark refers to something that doesn’t change. Guar gum doesn’t
appear in dairy products unless someone’s been tampering with Mother Nature. Present tense
works for an unchangeable fact.
E
is. Math doesn’t change, so present tense is appropriate here.
F
is. Peanut butter is always made from nuts; the definition can’t change, so present tense is best
here.

G
have. What do strawberries have now? Press conferences? Because strawberries and seeds are
linked for eternity, go for present tense.
H
were. One particular strawberry had 45 seeds, but another strawberry may have a different
number. Because this sentence expresses a changeable and not an eternal truth and because
the sentence as a whole is in past tense, past tense is appropriate for the last verb as well.
I
knew. Marty (contrary to the opinion of every single one of her teachers) can learn, so this
statement expresses a fact that may change. The past tense works best here because the sen-
tence is talking about a previous time.
J
does. Vegetarian diets never include meat. The definition is set, so present tense is needed here.
K
Peering. Here the two actions take place at the same time. The researchers check out the sub-
jects’ teeth and check for trouble. The perfect form (with having) is for actions at different
times.
L
hearing. Once again, two actions take place at the same time. Go for the plain form.
M
Refusing. The “not in this universe will I open my mouth” moment is simultaneous with an “if
looks could kill” glare, so the plain form is best.
N
having been completed. The plain form completed would place two actions (the completing
and the tabulating) at the same time. Yet common sense tells you that the tabulating follows
the completion of the research. The perfect form (with having) places the completing before
the tabulating.
O
having gone. The decision to stop market research is based on the fact that it’s too late; the
tooth whitener, in all its glory, is already being manufactured. Because the timeline matters
here, and one action is clearly earlier, the perfect form is needed.
P
to interview. The have form places the action of interviewing before the action expressed by
the main verb in the sentence. But the legal department objected first. Dump the have form.
Q
getting. Three actions are mentioned in this sentence: scheduling, succeeding, and getting. 
The first action is placed in the future, so don’t worry about it. The last two actions take place
at the same time, because the minute somebody signs a legal paper, the attorneys are success-
ful. As it expresses a simultaneous action, the plain form of the verbal (without having) is
appropriate.
R
Sending. The CEO’s statement places two things, sending and being sure, at the same time.
Bingo: The plain form is best.
S
Weeping. The interviewers are all choked up as they clap their hands and hope for a very big
raise. Plain form works because the two things happen at the same time.
T
having been. The celebration and “time to get back to work” movement take place at the same
time as the announcement. No perfect tense is needed.
163
Chapter 12: Traveling in Time: Tricky Verb-Tense Situations

164
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 
U
The proceeding and the noticing took place at roughly the same time, so the plain form is the
one you want here.
V
The noticing and the coming of the smoke were more or less simultaneous, so go for the plain
form here. The perfect form would place one action earlier than another, which is contrary to
the intended meaning.

This sentence emphasizes the order of events. Because the television was not turned off first,
Faulkner couldn’t hear. The perfect form works to show an earlier action (not turning off the 
television).
Y
The screaming and the creeping are simultaneous; go for the plain form.
z
The touching of the door and the waiting are simultaneous, calling for a plain (no sprinkles
added) verbal.
Z
The narrator wished to find Faulkner (everyone’s looking for him, including his bookie), and the
wishing and finding are more or less simultaneous. Plain form doesn’t set up any special order
of events.
1
The plain infinitive to strangle is appropriate because the narrator wished to find and to strangle
Faulkner all at the same time. The actions are presented equally, not in time order.
2
The calling and replying are presented as simultaneous acts, so go for plain, not perfect.
3
The apologizing and the arriving are going on at the same time; a plain form is therefore best.
4
This verb expresses summarized speech, so past tense is what you want.
5
Another speech summary is expressed by this verb, so go for past tense.
6
In summarizing speech, always opt for past tense.
7
All these verbs fall into the category of summarized speech and thus take the past tense.
8
The I in the sentence is speaking now, so the plain form is needed.
9
Fire is always hot, so present tense works here.
0
This unchangeable fact (fire is never without smoke) calls for present tense.
!
These two cowards took off at exactly the same time they heard a buzz — no time lag here! The
perfect form would indicate two consecutive events, but these events were simultaneous and
thus need the plain form.
@
Summarized speech, indicated by told, calls for past tense.
#
Being keeps the speakers in the moment. The writer is not placing the mood before another
action. Go for plain form.
$
The perfect form is appropriate because the speaker is putting events in order. First, the show
ends. Second, they put on a CD.
%
In hopes of saving his job, the writer emphasizes the order of events, using the perfect form to
place the calling of the police earlier on the timeline.
^
The intending and the disrupting are simultaneous, so plain form is best.
&
Plain form works here because the intending and the ruining occur at the same time.
*
Here the writer is emphasizing a longstanding respect for the film world. The perfect form
extends the respectful feeling into the past.

Chapter 13
Are You and Your Verbs 
in the Right Mood?
In This Chapter
 Understanding the indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods of verbs
 Choosing verbs for statements, commands, and condition-contrary-to-fact sentences
N
o, they’re not pregnant or in the midst of midlife crises; nevertheless, verbs do have
mood swings. One minute they’re indicative, the regular, plain-vanilla, just-the-facts
sort of verb. (The dishes are dirty. No one has washed them. Little colonies of mold estab-
lished themselves all over the sink a couple of days ago.) Suddenly they’re issuing orders in
imperative mood. (Wash the dishes. Stop whining. Don’t think your allowance is off limits!)
And when you least expect a change, subjunctive pops up. (If I were rich enough to hire a
maid, I wouldn’t ask for your dishwashing help. I’m not a millionaire, so I request that 7 p.m.
be the official dishwashing hour.)
Got the idea? Of the three verb moods, you’re probably the most familiar with indicative.
Every statement of fact is in indicative mood, as are nearly all the sentences in this book. The
imperative mood gives commands, usually to an understood you who doesn’t appear in the
sentence. The subjunctive, the one designed to give you a headache, shows up in condition-
contrary-to-fact and in certain command/wish sentences. In this chapter I take you through all
three, with a little extra attention on the hard one, also known as the subjunctive.
Stating the Obvious: Indicative Mood
Just about everything I say about verbs in this book actually applies to indicative verbs,
which, as the name implies, indicate facts. Indicative mood is the one you use automatically,
stating action or being in any tense and for any person. Do you want to see some samples of
indicative verbs? No problem. Every verb in this paragraph is in indicative mood. I have
placed all the verbs in italics so you can locate them easily.
Indicative verbs change according to the time period you’re talking about (the tense) and,
at times, according to the person doing the action. I cover these issues in Chapters 1 and 2.
If you’re in the mood, circle the indicative verb that works best in each of the following sen-
tences. The verb choices are in parentheses.
Q. Mr. Adams (holds/held) a performance review every June.
A. holds. Both choices are indicative, but the present tense works better. The clue is the 
expression every June.

1. Each employee (is/was) summoned to Adams’ office for what he calls “a little chat.”
2. All the workers (know/will know) that the “chat” is all on Adams’ side.
3. Adams (likes/like) to discuss baseball, the economy, and the reasons no one (will/would)
receive a raise.
4. “(Is/Was) business good these days?” he always says.
5. He always (mentions/will mention) that he may have to make personal sacrifices to save
the company.
6. Sacrifices! He (means/meant) that he (earns/will earn) only a million instead of two mil-
lion next year!
7. Maybe he (replaced/will replace) the linen napkins in the executive dining room with
paper.
8. After the chat, the employees always (go/will go)  out for some conversation of their own.
9. (Does/Do) they review Adams’ performance in the most candid way?
10. Everyone (believe/believes) that the company needs new leadership.
Taking Command: Imperative Mood
I studied a couple of foreign languages in college, and I remember a major headache arriv-
ing right around the time I tried to learn the imperative mood. Each verb had a bunch of
rules on how to form commands — plus irregulars! English is much kinder than those other
languages. In English, the command, also known as the imperative mood, is the same
whether you’re talking to one person or 20, to a peasant or to a queen. The English com-
mand form is the infinitive minus the to. In other words, the unchanged, plain form of the
verb. Negative commands are slightly different. They take the infinitive-minus-to and add do
not, as in do not snivel, do not blink, and do not blubber.
Some examples, with the imperative verb italicized:
Stop sniveling, Henry.
Pull yourself together and meet your new in-laws.
Do not mention our engagement.
Prepare to die if they find out we’re getting married!
Fill in the blanks with commands for poor Henry, who is meeting his prospective in-laws.
The base verb you’re working with appears in parentheses at the end of each sentence.
Q. _______________ quietly on the couch, Henry, while I fetch Daddy. (to sit)
A. Sit. The command is formed by dropping the to from the infinitive.
11. Henry, _______________ my lead during the conversation. (to follow)
12. If Mom talks about Paris, _______________ your head and _______________ interested. 
(to nod/to look)
168
Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

13. Dad hates bad accents, so _______________ French. (to speak, negative command)
14. _______________ them to show you slides of last year’s trip to Normandy. (to ask)
15. _______________ asleep during the slide show, if you can help it! (to fall, negative command)
16. _______________ some of Mom’s potato salad, even if it’s warm. (to eat)
17. _______________ about unrefrigerated mayonnaise and the risk of food poisoning. (to talk,
negative command)
18. When she ignores you and serves the potato salad anyway, just _______________ an
appointment with your doctor and _______________ quiet. (to make/to keep)
19. _______________ them good night and _______________ them for a lovely evening. (to wish/
to thank)
20. _______________ that we won’t visit them very often after the wedding. (to remember)
Telling Lies or Being Passive: 
Subjunctive Mood
The subjunctive is a very big deal in some languages; whole terms were devoted to it in my
college Spanish class. Fortunately for you, in English the subjunctive pops up only rarely, in
two situations: condition-contrary-to-fact and indirect commands.
Condition-contrary-to-fact means that you’re talking about something that isn’t true.
If I were famous, I would wear sunglasses to hide my identity. (The verb were is
subjunctive.)
Had I known the secret password, I would have passed the bouncer’s test and
entered the club.
If I had not punched the police office, I would have avoided jail.
Notice that the subjunctive changes some of the usual forms. In indicative, the pronoun I 
is paired with was (see the section on indicative mood earlier in this chapter for more
detail). The switch to were in the first sample sentence tells you that you’re in fantasy land.
Referring to the first sample sentence, I must confess that I’m not famous, though I do wear
sunglasses. In the second and third sample sentences, the had does more than its usual
indicative job, which is to place events earlier in the past than other past-tense events. (See
Chapter 1 for more details on this use of had.) Instead, in a subjunctive sentence the had
also means that I didn’t know the secret password, the bouncer muttered something about
“getting in when it snows in July,” and I was forced to go the 19th Precinct instead of danc-
ing with sports stars and supermodels.
Condition-contrary-to-fact sentences always feature a would form of the verb. In standard
English, the would form never appears in the part of the sentence that is untrue.
Subjunctive verbs also express commands indirectly, as in these sentences, in which the
subjunctive verb is italicized:
The bouncer requested that he remove himself from the line as soon as possible.
The club owner declared that guests wearing unfashionable clothes be denied entry.
169
Chapter 13: Are You and Your Verbs in the Right Mood?

Subjunctive, indirect commands are formed by dropping the to from the infinitive. In the
first sample sentence, the pronoun he normally (that is, in indicative mood) pairs with
removes. In subjunctive, the infinitive to remove loses the to and becomes remove. In the
second sample, guests pairs with be, which is created by dropping to from the infinitive to
be. The indicative form would be guests are.
Write the correct verb in the blank for each exercise in this section. The verb you’re work-
ing with appears in parentheses after each sentence. Just to keep you honest, I tucked in a
few sentences that don’t require subjunctive. Keep your eyes open.
Q. If Ellen _______________ for her turn at the wheel, she wouldn’t have wrapped her car
around that telephone pole. (to prepare)
A. had prepared. The had creates a subjunctive here, because Ellen didn’t prepare for her
road test. Instead, she went to a drive-in movie, as a passenger.
21. The motor vehicle tester asked that Ellen _______________ ready for her exam at 9 a.m. 
(to be)
22. The test would have gone better if Ellen _______________ a morning person. (to be)
23. “If it _______________,” explained the instructor, “you will be required to take the test as
soon as the roads are plowed.” (to snow)
24. If the snow plow _______________ the entire route, Ellen would have passed. (to cover)
25. Unfortunately, the supervisor of the snow-removal crew declared that the highways
_______________ cleaned first. (to be)
26. Terrified of ice, Ellen requested that the examiner _______________ her test. (to postpone)
27. If he _______________, Ellen would have taken the test on a sunny, warm day. (to refuse,
negative form)
28. If Ellen _______________ about the examiner, the motor vehicle department would have
investigated. (to complain)
29. If an examiner _______________ unfair, the motor vehicle department schedules another
test. (to be)
30. The department policy is that if there _______________ a valid complaint, they dismiss the
examiner promptly. (to be)
31. If Ellen _______________ the test fives times already, she would have been more cheerful
about her grade. (to take, negative form)
32. If in the future Ellen _______________ to another district, she may have more luck. (to go)
33. Not every county, for example, cares if the driver _______________ into a tree. (to skid)
34. If only Ellen _______________ to Smithsburg, she would have a license already. (to travel)
35. Smithsburg requires that a driver _______________ “reasonable competency” and nothing
more. (to demonstrate)

Re: Coffee Break Control
July 31, 2006
As you know, I were now in charge of implementing the new directive that every 
employee submits to a coffee-residue test. If a test were given at a time when coffee-
sipping were not authorized and the results were positive, the policy require that the 
worker “donates” a pound of coffee to the break room.
Do not asked me to describe the union’s reaction to this directive. If I would tell you 
what the shop steward would have said, you had blushed. All I would say is that the 
steward were not happy.
Would you have known about the reaction before issuing the directive, you would have 
had reconsidered. One more thing: the coffee stains on my shirt, if they were to come 
out, should not make you thought that I were drinking coffee outside of the official break 
time. These stains result from coffee being thrown at me.

Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 
Answers to Verb Mood Problems
a
is. The sentence speaks of an on-going situation, so present tense is best.
b
know. The workers have been through this “chat” many times, so the act of knowing isn’t in the
future but in the present.
c
likes, will. The present-tense form for talking about someone (Adams, in this sentence) is likes.
The future-tense verb will explains that in the coming year, as always, employees will be shop-
ping in the bargain basement.
d
Is. The expression these days is a clue that you want a present-tense verb that talks about some-
thing or someone.
e
mentions. If an action always occurs, present tense is the best choice.
f
means, will earn. The boss is talking about the future (the clue is next year). The talking takes
place in the present (so you want means), but the earning is in the future (hence, will earn).
g
will replace. The maybe creates a hypothetical situation, wondering what the boss will do in
the future.
h
go. An on-going situation calls for present tense.
i
Do. The subject they calls for the plural form.
j
believes. Although everyone sounds like a plural, it’s actually a singular pronoun requiring a
singular verb.
k
follow. The command is formed by stripping the to from the infinitive.
l
nod, look. Drop the to and you’re in charge, commanding poor Henry to act interested even if
he’s ready to call off the engagement rather than listen to one more story about French wine.
m
don’t speak or do not speak. The negative command relies on do.
n
Ask. Poor Henry! He has to ask, which in command form is ask.
o
Do not fall. Take to from the infinitive and add one do and you have a negative command.
p
Eat. Henry’s in for a long evening, given the command Eat, which is created by dropping to from
the infinitive.
q
Don’t talk or Do not talk. The negative command needs do or it dies.
r
make, keep. Drop the to from each infinitive and you’re in imperative mood.

173
Chapter 13: Are You and Your Verbs in the Right Mood?
s
Wish, thank. The imperative verbs are created by subtracting to from the infinitives.
t
Remember. Somehow I doubt that Henry will forget this fact, but to order him, take to from the
infinitive.
u
be. The subjunctive is needed for this indirect command, expressed by the verb asked.
v
were. Ellen likes to sleep until mid-afternoon. As she’s not a morning person, the subjunctive
verb were expresses condition-contrary-to-fact. The verb were is better than had been because
Ellen still is not a morning person, and had been brings in the past.
w
snows. Surprise! This one isn’t subjunctive. The instructor is talking about a possibility, not a
condition that didn’t occur. The normal indicative form, snows, is what you want.
x
had covered. The plow didn’t finish (the clue here is  would have passed), so subjunctive is
needed.
y
be. An indirect command is created by the verb declared. The subjunctive be fits nicely.
A
postpone. The indicative (the normal, everyday form) of to postpone is postpones, when the
verb is paired with examiner. Here the indirect command created by requested calls for the sub-
junctive postpone.
B
had not refused. The examiner stood firm: Take the test or die. Thus the first part of this sen-
tence is condition-contrary-to-fact and calls for the subjunctive.
C
had complained. Ellen said nothing, as revealed by the conditional would have investigated in
the second part of the sentence. Subjunctive is the way to go!
D
is. Did I get you here? The possibility expressed in the if portion of the sentence calls for a
normal, indicative verb (is). Stay away from subjunctive if the statement may be true.
E
is. The first part of this sentence is not condition-contrary-to-fact. It expresses a possibility and
thus calls for the normal, indicative verb (is).
F
had not taken. She has taken it five times, so the statement isn’t true and needs a subjunctive.
G
goes. Here the sentence expresses a possibility. She may go and she may have more luck. Stay
away from subjunctive if the sentence may be true.
H
skids. As in sentence 32, this one talks about something that is true (or may be true). Go for the
normal indicative and give the subjunctive a rest.
I
had traveled. She didn’t travel, and she (thank goodness) doesn’t have a license. This condi-
tion-contrary-to-fact sentence needs the subjunctive.
J
demonstrate. The verb requires tips you off to the fact that subjunctive is appropriate for the
indirect command.

K
Correct.
L
The indicative is called for here because the sentences expresses a truth, not a condition-
contrary-to-fact or a command.
M
This part of the sentence expresses an indirect command, that every employee submit. The
indicative verb that matches the singular subject every employee is submits, but the subjunc-
tive form (submit) is needed here.
N
A normal indicative verb works here because possibility exists.
O
The indicative is works best in this sentence, which expresses a real possibility and not a 
condition-contrary-to-fact.
P
Because the possibility exists, the indicative is called for.
Q
This statement is simply a fact, so the indicative is needed.
R
The second part of the sentence is an indirect command (the employee “donate”) and needs
the subjunctive.

Part III: The Pickier Points of Correct Verb and Pronoun Use 

S
The imperative mood, the command, calls for the infinitive minus the to. As this is a negative
command, do not is added. In the original, the -ed at the end of ask is wrong.
T
The writer is not telling, so a subjunctive verb form is needed to express a condition-contrary-
to-fact.
U
The report referred to concerns what was actually said. Indicative rules!
V
In a sentence expressing a condition-contrary-to-fact, the “untrue” portion should be subjunc-
tive, with the “would” statement in the other part of the sentence. This sentence reverses the
proper order (and plops a correct indicative verb, said, in the middle). Another possible correc-
tion: Had I told you . . . you would blush.
W
A plain indicative verb is needed for this statement.
X
The original has a subjunctive (were) but indicative is called for in this simple statement.
Y
The sentence expresses an untruth, so you need subjunctive. The corrected sentence reads
“Had you known about the reaction. . . .”
z
The original has two “would” statements. The “would” doesn’t belong in the “untrue” portion of
the sentence. Replace the first with a had statement and you’re in business: Had you known . . .
you would have reconsidered.
Z
This sentence doesn’t express a condition-contrary-to-fact. Instead, it talks about a possibility.
Go with indicative, not subjunctive.
1
Stay in the indicative present here, not past.
2
Indicative present is needed here.
3
Correct.

In this part . . .
L
isten to a little kid and you hear language at its most
basic: Tommy want apple. Mommy go store? No nap! 
These “sentences” — nouns and verbs and little else —
communicate effectively, but everyone who’s passed the
sandbox stage needs a bit more. Enter descriptions and
comparisons. Also enter complications, because quite a
few common errors are associated with these elements.
In this part you can practice your navigation skills, steer-
ing around such pitfalls as the choice between adjectives,
adverbs, and articles. (Sweet or sweetly? Good or well? A
or an? Chapter 14 explains all.) This part also tackles the
placement of descriptions (Chapter 15) and the proper
way to form comparisons (Chapters 16 and 17). Mastering
all these topics lifts you out of the sandbox and places you
permanently on the highest grammatical levels.

D
o you write good or well — and what’s the difference? Does your snack break feature 
a apple or an apple or even the apple? If you’re stewing over these questions, you have
problems . . . specifically, the problems in this chapter. Here you can practice choosing
between two types of descriptions, adjectives and adverbs. This chapter also helps you
figure out whether a, an, or the is appropriate in any given situation.
Distinguishing Between Adjectives and Adverbs
In your writing or speaking, of course, you don’t need to stick labels on adjectives and
adverbs. But you do need to send the right word to the right place in order to get the job
done, the job being to communicate your meaning to the reader or listener. (You also need to
punctuate strings of adjectives and adverbs correctly. For help with that topic, check out
Chapter 5.) A few wonderful words (fast, short, last, and likely, for example) function as both
adjectives and adverbs, but for the most part, adjectives and adverbs are not interchangeable.
Adjectives describe nouns — words that name a person, thing, place, or idea. They also
describe pronouns, which are words that stand in for nouns (other, someone, they, and simi-
lar words). Adjectives usually precede the word they describe, but not always. In the follow-
ing sentence, the adjectives are italicized:
The rubber duck with his lovely orange bill sailed over the murky bath water. (Rubber
describes duck; lovely and orange describe bill; murky and bath describe water.)
An adverb, on the other hand, describes a verb, usually telling how, where, when, or why an
action took place. Adverbs also indicate the intensity of another descriptive word or add
information about another description. In the following sentence, the adverbs are italicized:
The alligator snapped furiously as the duck violently flapped his wings. (Furiously
describes snapped; violently describes flapped.)
Most adverbs end in -ly, but some adverbs vary, and adjectives can end with any letter in
the alphabet, except maybe Q or Z. If you’re not sure which form is an adjective and which
is an adverb, check the dictionary. Most definitions include both forms with handy labels
telling you what’s what.

Here I hit you with a description dilemma: which word is correct? The parentheses contain
both an adjective and an adverb. Circle your selection.
Q. The water level dropped (slow/slowly), but the (intense/intensely) alligator-duck quarrel
went on and on.
A. slowly, intense. How did the water drop? The word you want from the first parentheses
must describe an action, so the adverb slowly wins the prize. Next up is a description of a
quarrel, a thing, so the adjective intense does the job.
1. The alligator, a (loyal/loyally) member of the Union of Fictional Creatures, (sure/surely)
resented the duck’s presence near the drainpipe.
2. “How dare you invade my (personal/personally) plumbing?” inquired the alligator (angry/
angrily).
3. “You don’t have to be (nasty/nastily)!” replied the duck.
4. The two creatures (swift/swiftly) circled each other, both looking for a (clear/clearly)
advantage.
5. “You are (extreme/extremely) territorial about these pipes,” added the duck.
6. The alligator retreated (fearful/fearfully) as the duck quacked (sharp/sharply).
7. Just then a (poor/poorly) dressed figure appeared in the doorway.
8. The creature whipped out a bullhorn and a sword that was (near/nearly) five feet in length.
9. When he screamed into the bullhorn, the sound bounced (easy, easily) off the tiled walls.
10. “Listen!” he ordered (forceful/forcefully). “The alligator should retreat to the sewer and
the duck to the shelf.”
11. Having given this order, the (Abominable/Abominably) Snowman seemed (happy/happily).
12. The fight in the bathtub had made him (real/really) angry.
13. “You (sure/surely) can’t deny that we imaginary creatures must stick together,” explained
the Snowman.
14. Recognizing the (accurate/accurately) statement, the duck apologized to the alligator.
15. The alligator retreated to the sewer, where he found a (lovely/lovingly) lizard with an urge
to party.
16. “Come (quick/quickly),” the alligator shouted to the duck.
17. The duck left the tub (happy/happily) because he thought he had found a new friend.
18. The alligator also celebrated because he had discovered an enemy (dumb/dumbly)
enough to enter the sewer, the alligator’s turf.
19. “You go (first/firstly),” murmured the gator, as the duck entered a (particular/
particularly) narrow tunnel.
20. The duck waddled (wary/warily), beginning to suspect danger.
180
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 

21. “You look (worried/worriedly),” said the alligator.
22. The duck was (silent/silently), too frightened to quack.
23. Fortunately, the Snowman had also decided to explore the (winding/windingly) tunnel.
24. The Snowman sounded (angry/angrily) as he scolded the gator.
25. “I’ve had it!” he screamed. “I’m sealing these (filthy/filthily) pipes for once and for all!”
How’s It Going? Choosing Between
Good/Well and Bad/Badly
For some reason, the “judgment” adjective and adverb pairs (good and well, bad and badly)
cause a lot of trouble. Here’s a quick guide on how to use them. Good and bad are adjectives,
so they have to describe nouns (people, places, things, or ideas). Well and badly are adverbs
used to describe action. They also attach to other descriptions. In the expression a well writ-
ten essay, for example, well is attached to the word written, which describes essay.
Well can be an adjective in one particular circumstance: health. When someone asks how
you are, the answer (I hope) is I am well or I feel well. You can also — and I hope you do —
feel good, especially when you’re talking about your mental state, though this usage is a bit
more informal. Apart from health questions, however, well is a permanent member of the
adverb team. In fact, if you can insert the word healthy in a particular spot, well works in
the same spot also.
Check out these judgment words in action:
I gave a good report to the boss this morning. (The adjective good describes the
noun report.)
In my opinion, the report was particularly well written. (The adverb well attaches
to the verb written.)
Truffle, a bad dog, snarfed up an entire bag of kibble this morning. (The adjective
bad describes the noun dog.)
Truffle slept badly after his kibble-fest. (The adverb badly describes the verb slept.)
When a description follows a verb, danger lurks. You have to decide whether the descrip-
tion gives information about the verb or about the person/thing who is doing the action or
being. If the description attaches to the verb, go for an adverb. If it attaches to the person/
thing (the subject, in grammatical terms), opt for the adjective.
Put on your judge’s robes and circle the right word in each set of parentheses.
Q. Truffle’s trainer works (good/well) with all types of dogs, especially those that don’t out-
weigh him.
A. well. How does the trainer work? The word you need must be an adverb because you’re
giving information about an action (work), not a noun.
26. Truffle barks when he’s run (good/well) during his daily race with the letter carrier, Adam
Arbel.
27. The letter carrier likes Truffle and feels (bad/badly) about beating him.

28. Truffle, on the other hand, tends to bite the poor guy whenever the race doesn’t turn out
(good/well).
29. Truffle’s owner named him after a type of chocolate candy she likes very (good/well).
30. The slightly deaf letter carrier thinks high-calorie snacks are (bad/badly).
31. He eats organic sprouts and wheat germ for lunch, though his meal tastes (bad/badly).
32. Truffle once caught a corner of Arbel’s lunch bag and chewed off a (good/well) bit.
33. Resisting the urge to barf, Truffle ate (bad/badly), according to his doggie standards.
34. Truffle, who didn’t feel (good/well), barked quite a bit that day.
35. Tired of the din, his owner confiscated the kibble and screamed, “(Bad/Badly) dog!”
Mastering the Art of Articles
Three little words — a, an, and the — pop up in just about every English sentence. Some-
times (like my relatives) they show up where they shouldn’t. (I probably just blew my
Thanksgiving invitation.) Technically, these three words are adjectives, but they belong to the
subcategory of articles. As always, forget about the terminology. Just use them properly!
Here’s how to tell the difference:
 The refers to something specific. When you say that you want the book, you’re
implying one particular text, even if you haven’t named it. The attaches nicely to
both singular and plural words.
 A and an are more general in meaning, and they work only with singular nouns. If you
want a book, you’re willing to read anything, or at least to browse the bookshelves a bit.
A precedes words beginning with consonants, and an comes before words beginning
with vowels. In other words, you want a book but an encyclopedia.
If you want a general term but you’re talking about a plural, try some or any instead of
a or an, because these last two articles can’t deal with plurals.
Write an article covering the Miss Grammar Pageant — oops, wrong type of article.
Write the correct article in each blank in the sentences that follow.
Q. When Lulu asked to see _____ wedding pictures, she didn’t expect Annie to put on _____
twelve-hour slide show.
A. the, a. In the first half of the sentence, Lulu is asking for something specific. Also, wedding
pictures is a plural expression, so a and an are out of the question. In the second half of
the sentence, something more general is appropriate. Because twelve begins with the 
consonant t, a is the article of choice.
36. Although Lulu was mostly bored out of her mind, she did like _____ picture of Annie’s
Uncle Fred that caught him snoring in the back of the church.
37. _____ nearby guest, one of several attempting to plug up their ears, can be seen poking
Uncle Fred’s ribs.
38. At Annie’s wedding, Uncle Fred wore _____ antique bow tie that he bought in _____
department store next door to his apartment building.

41. Annie, who didn’t want to invite Uncle Fred but was forced to do so by her mother,

42. Annie’s plan was to zap him whenever he snored too loudly; unfortunately, Fred chose
_____ different seat.

roses that she was supposed to scatter in _____ center aisle.

Calling All Overachievers: Extra 
Practice with Descriptors
Show off the knowledge you gained from the sections in this chapter by finding the mis-
takes in this excerpt from a dress catalogue (see Figure 14-1). Twenty descriptive words are
underlined, but only some of them are wrong. Look for adjectives trying to do an adverb’s
job (and vice versa) or the wrong sort of articles. When you find an error, correct it. If the
description is okay, leave it alone.

Chapter 14: Writing Good or Well: Adjectives and Adverbs

Answers to Adjective and Adverb Problems
a
loyal, surely. What kind of member is the alligator? A loyal member. Because you’re describing
a noun (member), you need the adjective loyal. In the second part of the sentence, the adverb
surely explains how the duck’s presence was resented. Resented is a verb and must be described
by an adverb.
b
personal, angrily. In the first part of the sentence, personal describes a thing (plumbing). How
did the alligator inquire? Angrily. The adverb tells about the verb, inquire.
c
nasty. The adjective nasty describes you. Of course I don’t mean you-the-reader. You earned my
undying affection by buying this book. I would never call you nasty!
d
swiftly, clear. The adverb swiftly describes the action of circling. The adjective clear explains
what kind of advantage the creatures were seeking.
e
extremely. The adverb extremely clarifies the intensity of the descriptive word territorial. 
(If you absolutely have to know, territorial is an adjective describing you.)
f
fearfully, sharply. Both of these adverbs tell how the actions (retreated and quacked) were 
performed.
g
poorly. The adverb poorly gives information about the descriptive word dressed.
h
nearly. This was a tough question, and if you got it right, treat yourself to a spa day. The
expression five feet is a description of the sword. The adverb nearly gives additional informa-
tion about the description five feet in length.
i
easily. The adverb easily describes the verb bounced.
j
forcefully. The adverb forcefully tells how he ordered, a verb.
k
Abominable, happy. You can cheat on the first part of this one just by knowing the name of the
possibly imaginary monster that supposedly stalks the Himalayas, but you can also figure it out
with grammar. A snowman is a thing (or a person) and thus a noun. Adjectives describe nouns,
so abominable does the trick. In the second half you need an adjective to describe the snowman,
who was happy. You aren’t describing the action of seeming, so an adverb is inappropriate.
l
really. This sentence presents a common mistake. The word angry is a description; you need
an adverb to indicate its intensity, and really fills the bill.
m
surely. That horse in the fifth race might be a sure thing, because thing is a noun and you need
an adjective to describe it. But the verb deny must be described by an adverb, so surely is the
one you want.
n
accurate. Statement is a noun because it’s a thing. The adjective accurate attaches nicely to
statement.
o
lovely. A lizard is a noun, which may be described by the adjective lovely but not the adverb
lovingly. Incidentally, lovely isn’t an adverb, despite the fact that it ends with -ly.
p
quickly. The adverb quickly describes the verb come.
q
happy. This sentence presents a puzzle. Are you talking about the duck’s mood or the way in
which he left the tub? The two are related, of course, but the mood is the primary meaning, so
the adjective happy is the better choice. Happy, by the way, describes duck.
184
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 

r
dumb. The adjective dumb is attached to enemy. Most, but not all, adjectives are in front of the
words they describe, but in this case the adjective follows the noun.
s
first, particularly. The handy, adaptable word first functions as both an adjective (first prize)
and an adverb. In this sentence it’s an adverb telling about the verb go. The second answer is
also an adverb, attached to the descriptive word narrow.
t
warily. To describe the verb waddled, the adverb warily is best.
u
worried. The description isn’t talking about the action of looking but rather describing you.
The pronoun you may be described only by an adjective, so worried wins the prize here.
v
silent. This adjective describes the noun duck. The verb in between is a linking verb, which
may be thought of as a giant equal sign linking (how clever are these grammar terms!) the noun
and its description.
w
winding. As the Beatles once sang, you have to travel “a long and winding road” to this answer.
The adjective winding is attached to the noun tunnel.
x
angry. The adjective angry tells you about the Snowman. You’re not describing the action
(sounded) but instead the person doing the action (the Snowman). In this sentence, the verb
sounded is a stand-in for was, which is a linking verb that connects what precedes and follows it
(Snowman and angry).
y
filthy. If you’re describing pipes, a thing and therefore a noun, you need an adjective, which in
this case is filthy.
A
well. The adverb well tells you how Truffle has run.
B
bad. This sentence illustrates a common mistake. The description doesn’t tell you anything about
Truffle’s ability to feel (touching sensation). Instead, it tells you about the letter carrier’s state of
mind. Because the word is a description of a person, not of an action, you need an adjective, bad.
To feel badly implies that you’re wearing mittens and can’t feel anything through the thick cloth.
C
well. The adverb well is attached to the action to turn out (to result).
D
well. How does she like chocolate truffles? Almost as much as I do! Also, she likes them well.
The adverb is needed because you’re describing the verb likes.
E
bad. The description bad applies to the snacks, not to the verb are. Hence, an adjective is what
you want.
F
bad. The description tells you about his meal, a noun (also a truly terrible combination of
foods). You need the adjective bad.
G
good. The adjective (good) is attached to a noun (bit).
H
badly. Now you’re talking about the action (ate), so you need an adverb (badly).
I
well. The best response here is well, an adjective that works for health-status statements. Good
will do in a pinch, but good is better for psychological or mood statements.
J
Bad. The adjective bad applies to the noun dog.
K
the. The sentence implies that one particular picture caught Annie’s fancy, so the works nicely
here. If you chose a, no problem. The sentence would be a bit less specific but still acceptable.
The only true clinker is an, which must precede words beginning with vowels — a group that
doesn’t include picture.
185
Chapter 14: Writing Good or Well: Adjectives and Adverbs

L
A. Because the sentence tells you that several guests are nearby, the doesn’t fit here. The more
general a is best.
M
an or the, the. In the first blank you may place either an (which must precede a word beginning
with a vowel) or the. In the second blank, the is best because it’s unlikely that Fred is surrounded
by several department stores. The is more definitive, pointing out one particular store.
N
The, the, a, a. Lots of blanks in this one! The first two seem more particular (one clerk, one tie),
so the fits well. The second two blanks imply that the clerk selected one from a group of many,
not a particular microphone or transmitter. The more general article is a, which precedes
words beginning with consonants.
O
an. Because the radio station is described as obscure, a word beginning with a vowel, you need
an, not a. If you inserted the, don’t cry. That article works here also.
P
a. The word buzzer doesn’t begin with a vowel, so you have to go with a, not an. The more defi-
nite the could work, implying that the reader knows that you’re talking about a particular
buzzer, not just any buzzer.
Q
a. He chose any old seat, not a particular one, so a is what you want.
R
the. There’s only one air, so the, which is more specific, is what you need.
S
the, a, the. In the first and third blanks in this sentence, you’re discussing particulars, so the
fills the bill. In the middle blank, the more general article works well.
T
the, an. Because only one wedding ceremony is in question here, the does the job for the first
blank. In the second blank, he’s making an effort. The vowel in effort requires an, not a.

186
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 

U
The description comfortable must be intensified by the adverb surprisingly, not by the adjective
surprising.
V
The adjective comfortable describes the noun suits.
W
Polyester is a noun, so it must be described by an adjective. Easy, which is part of the combo
description easy-to-clean, attaches nicely to the noun.
X
The description varied is intensified by the adverb really.
Y
In this sentence office is an adjective describing grind, a noun here.
z
The adverb extremely intensifies the descriptive word bright.
Z
The adjective bright describes the club scene, a noun.
1
That wonderful word fast may be either an adjective or an adverb. Here it functions as an adjec-
tive describing track.
2
A particular sort of elegance is being discussed, so the definitive the is called for.
3
Elegance is a noun, so the adjective astonishing is the best description.
4
Eggplant is a color, which is a thing and therefore a noun. To describe a noun, the adjective
deep is needed.
5
To describe the noun curves, go for the adjective gentle, not the adverb gently.
6
An can only precede words beginning with vowels, and real begins with a consonant.
7
Natural is a descriptive word, so it must itself be described by an adverb, really.
8
The noun lining is described by the adjective silky.
9
The adverb delightfully attaches to another description, loud. Descriptions are always described
by adverbs, not by adjectives.
0
The article a is the one you need to precede a word beginning with a consonant.
!
The adjective strong describes the noun message.
@
Did I fool you here? True, you may have thought that softly described woven in this sentence,
but the meaning indicates otherwise. You’re not talking about how the cloth was woven.
Instead, you have two separate words (the comma clues you in on this) describing the noun
pants. Soft is an adjective, appropriate for noun descriptions.
#
Clearly you’re talking about one particular item, the extremely ugly jacket described as item A.
Hence the, which goes well with particulars, is better than the more general a.

Going on Location: Placing 
Descriptions Correctly
In This Chapter
 Placing even, only, almost, and similar words
 Avoiding misplaced, dangling, or confusing descriptions
M
y out-of-town friends always tell me that I can buy a ten-room mansion for the price
of a closet in New York City. My standard reply is that location is everything. That
statement is as true for descriptive words as it is for home prices. Plop one in the wrong
spot, and your meaning may sink like a stone.
First, some definitions: Descriptions in English may be composed of one word or, if you like
to pour it on, twenty or more. Regardless of length or form, descriptive elements fall into
one of two huge categories. They belong in the adjective bin if they describe people, places,
things, or ideas (in grammar terms, nouns or pronouns). The adverb family claims them if
they describe verbs (action or being words) or other descriptions. Flip to Chapter 14 for a
host of practice exercises with basic adjectives and adverbs.
The general principle guiding the placement of descriptions is simple: Descriptive words
should clearly relate to what they describe. Some sentences give you a bit more leeway than
others. Move a descriptive word an inch and the meaning still comes across. But a few
words require precision.
In this chapter you can practice that precision and, like a real estate agent, concentrate on
location, location, location.
Little Words Mean a Lot: Situating “Even,”
“Only,” and Similar Words
The other day I saw a tee shirt that made me want to turn my grammar book into a guided
missile. The shirt declared that My Grandma went to NYC and only bought me this lousy tee
shirt. Why, as a founding member of Grammarians Anonymous, was I upset? Because the
descriptive term only was misplaced. The sentence as written means that Grandma did
nothing at all in NYC except buy one tee shirt — no theater, no walk in Central Park — just
tee-shirt buying.
Little words — only, even, almost, just, nearly, and not — will torpedo the meaning of your
sentence if you put them in the wrong spot. Each of these descriptions should precede the
word being described. Take a look at these examples:

Even Mary knows that song. (Mary generally sticks to talk radio, but the song is
so popular that she recognizes it.)
Mary knows even that song. (Mary has 56,098 CDs. She knows every musical work
ever written, including the one that the sentence is referring to.)
Got the idea? Now take a look at the following sentences. If you find a misplaced
description, rewrite the sentence as it should be. If everything is fine and dandy, write
“correct” in the blank.

A. My Uncle Fred pays taxes only when he’s in the mood or when the IRS serves an arrest
warrant. The only has to move because it makes a comment on the conditions that make
Fred pay up (his mood and the times when the IRS puts him in the mood). This descrip-
tion should precede the conditions it talks about. The only is not a comment on pays, so
it’s out of place in the original.

It Must Be Here Somewhere! 
Misplaced Descriptions
If you’re at a car dealership and want to buy a new car from a sales associate with snow
tires, you’re in the right place. Unfortunately, the description — with snow tires — is not,
because its current placement attaches it to sales associate and thus indicates a car guy
whose feet have been replaced by big round rubber things, not a vehicle you can drive 
confidently through a storm.
This section deals with long descriptions (for the grammar obsessed: prepositional 
phrases, verbals, and clauses) that sometimes stray from their appointed path. I cover 
short descriptions — simple adjectives and adverbs — in Chapter 14. To keep your 
descriptions legal, be sure that they’re very close to the word they describe.
Except for a few place or time descriptions, nearly every multiword description directly fol-
lows the word it describes, as in these sentences:
I want to buy a car with snow tires from a sales associate. (The description with
snow tires describes car.)
The bread that Lulu baked yesterday is as hard as the rock of Gibraltar. (That Lulu
baked yesterday refers to bread.)
The leaf shimmering in the sunlight bothers Jeff’s light-sensitive eyes. (The expres-
sion shimmering in the sunlight describes the leaf.)
These descriptions quickly become absurd if they move slightly. (Imagine the sentence,
The bread is as hard as the rock of Gibraltar that Lulu baked yesterday. See what I mean?)
When you move a misplaced description, take care not to make another error. For example,
if I change I placed a stone in my pocket that I found in the playground to I placed a stone that
I found in the playground in my pocket, I have a problem. In the original sentence, I found the
pocket in the playground. In the changed sentence, I have a playground in my pocket. The
solution is to place a description at the beginning of the sentence: In my pocket I placed a
stone that I found in the playground.
Check out the following sentences. If all the descriptions are where they should be, write
“correct” in the blank. If anything is misplaced, rewrite the sentence in the blanks provided,
dropping the description into the right spot. Tip: In addition to moving descriptions, you
may have to reword here and there in order to create a sentence that makes sense.

Hanging off a Cliff: Dangling Descriptions
The most common structure in an English sentence is subject (the person or thing you’re
talking about) and verb (a statement of being or action about the subject), in that order. This
structure is a good workhorse to carry your meaning to the reader, but it’s a bit boring if
overused. To spice up your writing, you may begin some sentences with extra information —
introductory descriptions that may resemble verbs but not actually be verbs. (In official
grammar terminology, they’re verbals. Verbals can show up elsewhere in the sentence; in this
section I’m just dealing with those that introduce sentences.) Usually a comma separates
these introductory statements from the main portion of the sentence. Here are a couple of
examples, with the introductory description italicized:
Dazzled by the reflection from Tiffany’s new diamond ring, Lulu reached for her
sunglasses. (The introductory description gives more information about Lulu.)
To block out all visible light, Lulu’s glasses have been coated with a special plastic
film. (The introductory description gives more information about the glasses.)
A variation of this sort of introduction is a statement with an implied subject:
While wearing these glasses, Lulu can see nothing at all and thus constantly walks
into walls. (The implied statement is While Lulu is wearing these glasses.)
All these introductory elements must follow one important rule: The subject of the sen-
tence must be what the introduction describes. In the preceding examples, Lulu is the one
who is dazzled, Lulu’s glasses are what blocks out light, and Lulu is the one who is wearing
the sunglasses.
A common error is to detach the introduction from the subject, resulting in a sentence with
flawed logic, what grammarians call a dangling modifier or simply a dangler. (English
thoughtfully supplies you with plenty of room for error. Here I deal with faulty descriptions
at the beginning of a sentence. If you want to avoid misplaced descriptions elsewhere in
the sentence, check out the preceding section on misplaced description.) Here are some
dangers:
Perched on her nose, the stop sign was invisible to Lulu’s eyes.
Before buying them, the glasses carried a clear warning, which Lulu ignored.
In the first preceding sentence the stop sign is on her nose — not a pretty picture and also
not what the writer is trying to say. In the second sample sentence, the expansion of the
sentence would read Before the glasses were buying them. Illogical! These corrections tie up
the danglers:
194
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 

Perched on her nose, Lulu’s glasses made the stop sign invisible.
Before buying them, Lulu read a warning about the glasses and chose to ignore it.
Check out these sentences for danglers and rewrite if necessary. If everything is securely
attached, write “correct” in the blank. Your rewritten sentence may differ from the sug-
gested answer. No problem, as long as the introductory information refers to the subject.
Q. After waiting for a green light, the crosswalk filled with people rushing to avoid Lulu and
her speeding skateboard.
________________________________________________________________________________

A. After waiting for a green light, people rushed into the crosswalk to avoid Lulu and her
speeding skateboard. In the original sentence, the crosswalk is waiting for a green light.

where Lulu is riding blind, thanks to her non-see-through sunglasses.

Dazed and Confused: Vague Descriptions
If you’ve read the previous sections in this chapter, you already know that the general rule
governing descriptions is that they should be near the word they’re describing. If you place
a description an equal distance from two words it may describe, however, you present a
puzzle to your reader. Not a good idea! Check out this beauty:
Protesting successfully scares politicians.
Which word does successfully describe? Protesting or scares? You can’t tell. Now look
at these corrections:
Successful protests scare politicians.
Protests scare politicians successfully.
Which one should you use? It depends on what you want to say. The point is that each of
these sentences is clear, and clarity is a great quality in writing, if not in politics.
Check out the following sentences and decide whether they’re clear or unclear. If they’re
clear, write “correct” in the blanks. If not, rewrite them.

spoke last week is the one who voted against the Clarity Bill. You may find still other

or voted, you’re fine.

Calling All Overachievers: Extra Practice
Placing Descriptions
Breathing deeply, check out this yoga instruction manual (see Figure 15-1), which, my
lawyer begs me to mention, does not describe real postures that a normal human body can
achieve. Do not try these positions at home, but do look for ten errors caused by vague,
misplaced, or dangling descriptions. After you find the clunkers, correct them — cross out
misplaced words, insert words by using carats, and revise sentences in the margins of this
book. Note: The errors have several possible corrections, but in the answers section, I
show only one correction for each error.
Yoga and Y’all: An Excerpt
If you only learn one yoga posture, this should be it. Beginners can even do 
it. To form the “Greeting Turtle Posture,” the mat should extend from knees 
to armpits freshly laundered and dried to fluffiness. While bending the right 
knee up to the nose, the left ankle relaxes. You should almost bend the 
knee for a minute before straightening it again. Throw your head back now 
extending each muscle to its fullest, only breathing two or three times 
before returning the head to its original position. Tucking the chin close to 
the collarbone, the nose should wiggle. Finally, raise the arms to the sky 
and bless the yoga posture that is blue.

Answers to Description Placement Problems
a
Because she was celebrating an important birthday, Ms. Jonge gave us only ten hours of
homework. The implication of this sentence is that she could have given twenty hours.
Because the number of hours is the issue, the only belongs in front of ten hours, not in front 
of gave.
b
The first task seemed nearly impossible: to write an essay about the benefits of getting older.
If it nearly seemed, it did not seem — just approached that state. But that’s not what you’re
trying to say here. Instead, the task approached impossible but stopped just short, still in the
realm of possibility. Thus the nearly describes impossible and should precede that word.
c
After I had written almost two pages, my instant message beeped and I put my pen down.
How many pages did you write? That’s what the sentence discusses. When the almost is in the
right place, you have about a page and a half or a bit more. In the original sentence, you have
nothing at all on paper because the sentence says that the speaker had almost written (had
approached the action of writing but then stopped).
d
I figured that even Ms. Jonge, the meanest teacher on the planet, would understand the
need to take a break. Clearly the sentence compares this particular teacher with all others, 
so the even belongs in front of her name.
e
I made a cup of coffee, but because I’m dieting, I ate only one doughnut and ignored the
other three that were silently shouting, “Eat me.” This sentence compares the number of
doughnuts eaten (one) with the number available (four). The only belongs in front of the
number, not in front of the action (ate).
f
My friend Eloise gained nearly three pounds last week just from eating glazed doughnuts.
One word — just — is in the appropriate place, but nearly must be moved. The nearly tells 
you that the gain was a bit less than three, and the just tells you the reason (snarfing down
doughnuts).
g
Eloise, my brother, and I love doughnuts, but not all of us eat them; Eloise can’t resist. To
correct this sentence you have to play around with the verb a little, because you don’t need the
do in the new sentence. Here’s the logic: If Eloise eats the doughnuts and the rest keep their lips
zipped, not all but some eat doughnuts. The original sentence illogically states that no one eats
and then goes on to discuss Eloise’s gobbling.
h
Even Eloise draws the line somewhere, and she seldom munches a chocolate sprinkle out-
side of homework time. The even shouldn’t precede draws because two actions aren’t being
compared. Instead, Eloise is being singled out.
i
After I had sent a text message to Eloise, I returned to my homework and found I had only
five tasks left. The sentence comments on the amount of remaining homework (only five tasks,
not six or seven). Hence the only properly precedes five tasks.
j
correct. Some work made you yawn and some didn’t. Logic tells you that not all is what you want.
k
I had to read two chapters about an empire that covered almost half the known world. If the
chapters almost covered, they didn’t cover at all, they just approached the act of covering. If the
empire covered almost half, it spread over maybe 40 to 45 percent of the known world, a much
more logical meaning.
l
The conquerors invaded even countries that had superb defense systems. They’re willing to
go up against the best (countries with superb defenses), and that’s where the even belongs. In
front of the verb, you get an implied comparison of action (even invaded, didn’t just threaten).

200
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 
m
correct. In this one Ms. Jonge almost assigned but then changed her mind. She didn’t assign,
say, the first five chapters and half of the sixth.
n
“I love nearly all children, except those who fight or scribble on their homework, and I
wanted to celebrate my birthday with a homework holiday,” she said. Whom does she love?
Nearly all, with some notable exceptions. If nearly love is what she does, then she feels affection
that never reaches the level of love. Because the sentence compares all children with all chil-
dren minus a few clinkers, the nearly belongs in front of all.
o
I was startled to hear that Ms. Jonge considers ten hours of homework a holiday, but I know
that she wants only what’s best for us. If she only wants, she doesn’t do anything else — just
wants. But this sentence implies a comparison between only what’s best for us and water tor-
ture. Thus the only belongs in front of what’s best for us.
p
With flying colors, Julie passed the eye examination administered by a very near-sighted
clerk. You can easily see what’s wrong with the original sentence. Fixing it can be tricky. If 
you move with flying colors so that it follows examination, you solve one problem and create
another because then the colors are administered by a very near-sighted clerk. You can place
with flying colors, as I have, at the beginning of the sentence or, if you wish, after passed. In
either spot the description is close enough to the verb to tell you how Julie passed, and that’s
the meaning you want.
q
correct. The two descriptions, written and for cars skidding on ice, are close to the words they
describe. Written describes test and for cars skidding on ice describes maneuvers.
r
Another question, which required an essay rather than a multiple-choice response, inquired
about defensive driving. Defensive driving techniques don’t include essays, but test questions
do. The description belongs after question because that’s the word being described.
s
About a week after the written portion of the exam, the Department of Motor Vehicles sent a
letter lacking sufficient postage and giving Julie an appointment for the road test. The letter
is described by lacking sufficient postage, so that description must follow letter. I inserted and
after postage to clarify that the letter, not the postage, gave Julie her appointment. The and
attaches both expressions (lacking sufficient postage, giving Julie an appointment for the road
test) to the same word, letter. Another possible correction drops lacking sufficient postage and
inserts postage-due before letter.
t
Before the letter arrived, Julie asked her sister to drive her to the testing site. This sentence
mentions two actions: asked and drive. The time element, before the letter arrived, tells you
when Julie asked, not when she wanted her sister to drive. The description should be closer 
to asked than to drive because asked is the word it describes.
u
correct. The description is where it should be. The information about the examiner’s foot is
near nervous man, and he’s the one with the fidgety foot.
v
The first page, which was single-spaced, contained details about Julie’s turning technique.
The page is described by single-spaced, not Julie’s three-point turn, which always sends her into
a skid.
w
Julie hit only two pedestrians in the middle of a crosswalk and one tree. Common sense tells
you that the tree isn’t in the crosswalk, but the pedestrians are. The description in the middle of
a crosswalk should follow the word it describes, in this case, pedestrians.
x
The examiner relaxed in his aunt’s house in Florida soon after Julie’s road test. I’m sure he
needed a break! The relaxing took place in his aunt’s house in Florida. The road test took place
on Route 9. Move the description closer to the word it describes.

201
Chapter 15: Going on Location: Placing Descriptions Correctly
y
Because the examiner had fainted when the speedometer hit 80, Julie wasn’t surprised to
hear that she had failed her first road test, but the pedestrians’ lawsuit was a shock. The
because statement should be closer to was not surprised, as that expression is being described.
You may have been tempted to move because the examiner had fainted when the speedometer
hit 80 to the spot after test. Bad idea! If you put the because information after test, it looks as if
she failed because the examiner had fainted. Yes, the examiner fainted, but the because informa-
tion relates to Julie’s lack of surprise and thus needs to be near was not surprised.
A
To skateboard safely, you may find kneepads helpful. In the original sentence, no one is skate-
boarding. A person must be inserted into the sentence. I’ve chosen you, but skaters, people, and
other terms are also okay, as long as some sort of potential skater is in the sentence.
B
Sliding swiftly across the sidewalk, Lulu smashed into a tree. Lulu should be the one doing
the sliding, not the tree, but the original sentence has the tree sliding across the sidewalk.
C
Although Lulu was bleeding from a cut near her nose ring, a change of sunglasses was out 
of the question. The original sentence has a change of sunglasses bleeding. The easiest way to
correct a sentence with the wrong implied subject is to insert the real subject, which is Lulu.
Another correct revision: Although bleeding from a cut near her nose ring, Lulu said that a
change of sunglasses was out of the question. Now Lulu is doing the bleeding, a common state
for her.
D
To look fashionable, one must sacrifice a certain amount. Who is looking fashionable? In the
original sentence, no one. Add a person: one, you, everybody, or something similar.
E
While designing her latest tattoo, Lulu thought it would be a good idea to attach a small
camera to the frames of her glasses. Lulu has to be doing the designing, but in the original sen-
tence, a small camera is designing her latest tattoo. Another way to correct this sentence is to
insert Lulu into the first part of the sentence, making her the subject: While Lulu was designing . . . .
F
Covered in rhinestones, Lulu’s glasses made a fashion statement. Lulu’s glasses are covered
in rhinestones, not Lulu herself. Lulu’s glasses must be the subject of the sentence.
G
Discussed in the fashion press, Lulu’s choice of eyewear was criticized in many articles.
What was discussed? The eyewear, not the articles.
H
correct. Tiffany’s coming to the rescue, so the sentence is fine.
I
To pacify Tiffany and the pedestrians’ lawyers, Lulu eventually threw the glasses into the
trash can. The glasses can’t pacify, but Lulu can.
J
correct. Okay, it’s a stretch to see Lulu as reasonable, not to mention the discomfort of a stain-
less steel helmet, but grammatically this sentence is correct.
K
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: A single red-light infraction earned a stiff
fine. Running a red light earned a stiff fine at one time. The problem word is once, which
must be more clearly attached to either running or earned. Here you have to reword and drop
the once in order to be perfectly clear whether you’re talking about at one time or a single time,
both of which are meanings of once.
L
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: Backing swiftly away from the traffic cop
caused a reaction. Backing away from the traffic cop caused a swift reaction. Here swiftly
causes problems unless it is moved closer to backing or, changed to swift, it describes reaction.
M
correct. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would hear this sentence and attach last summer to
was. This one passes the clarity test.

202
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 
N
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: When the case came to trial, the judge said
that he would punish the drivers severely. The judge said that he would punish the drivers
severely when the case came to trial. The problem with the original is subtle but nevertheless
worthy of attention. The expression when the case came to trial may be when the judge made
his statement or when the judge intended to wallop the drivers. Move the expression and clar-
ity reigns.
O
correct. The description soon can describe only arrived. The word preceding the description,
division, doesn’t logically attach to a time element, so the sentence is okay as written.
P
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: Speaking forcefully to the driver made the
point. Speaking to the driver made the point forcefully. The problem with the original is that
forcefully could describe either speaking or made. To clarify the meaning, you have to move
forcefully closer to one of those words.
Q
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: The driver recently charged with reckless
driving went to court. The driver charged with reckless driving went to court recently.
Recently is a description that, like all descriptions, likes to nestle next to the word it describes.
If you place it between two possible descriptions, it has a nervous breakdown.
R
Several corrections are possible. Two examples: The redesigned driver education course 
won an award a year ago. The driver education course was redesigned a year ago and has
won an award. The problem with the original sentence is that a year ago, placed between
redesigned and won, could describe either. Fixing this one is a bit tricky; you have to reword 
to express a clear meaning.
S
The description only applies to the number, not to the act of learning.
T
The description even is attached to beginners to show how easy this posture is.

Yoga and Y’all: An Excerpt
If you only learn only one yoga posture, this should be it. 
Even Bbeginners can even do it. To form the “Greeting Turtle Posture,” the 
mat should extend from knees to armpits freshly laundered and dried 
to fluffiness from knees to armpits extend the mat, which has been 
freshly laundered and dried to fluffiness. While bending the right knee up 
to the nose, relax the left ankle relaxes. You should 
almost bend the knee for almost a minute before straightening it again. 
Now Tthrow your head back, now extending each muscle to its fullest, 
only breathing only two or three times before returning the head to its 
original position. Tucking the chin close to the collarbone,
the nose should wiggle the nose. Finally, raise the arms to the sky 
that is blue and bless the yoga posture that is blue.

203
Chapter 15: Going on Location: Placing Descriptions Correctly
U
The sentence begins with a verb form (To form the “Greeting Turtle Posture”), so the subject of
the sentence must be the person who is supposed to do this ridiculous exercise. In the cor-
rected sentence, an understood “you” fills that need.
V
The laundry description belongs to mat, not to armpits, though I do think fluffy armpits are nice.
W
In the original sentence the subject of bending is implied, not stated, so by default, the other
subject in the sentence (the left ankle) takes that role. But the left ankle can’t bend the right
knee, so the logic is flawed. Changing the second half of the sentence to “relax the left ankle”
makes the subject you (understood), and “you” works as the understood subject you want for
the first half of the sentence. Another possible solution: Change the first half of the sentence to
“While you are bending. . . .”
X
The description almost applies to minute, not to bending.
Y
In the original sentence now is equidistant from throw and extending, creating a vague state-
ment. Moving the description clarifies the meaning. Once you move now, add a comma between
back and extending to help the reader separate these two actions.
z
The description only applies to the number of times one should breathe, not to the number of
actions one should be doing.
Z
The introductory verb form must be an action done by the subject, and the nose can’t tuck the
chin. The understood subject you can tuck the chin.
1
The color description belongs to sky, not to yoga posture. Another, more concise correction is
to delete “that is blue” and simply say, “blue sky.”

For Better or Worse: 
Forming Comparisons
In This Chapter
 Creating the comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs
 Dealing with irregular comparisons
 Identifying absolutes that may not be compared
D
oes Nellie have a bigger ice cream cone? Whose cold is worse? Do you think Tom
Cruise is the most attractive, strongest, and richest star in Hollywood? If human beings
weren’t so tempted to compare their situations with others’, then life — and grammar —
would be a lot easier.
Comparisons may be expressed by one word (higher, farther, or sooner) or two words (more
beautiful, most annoying, or least sensible). Sometimes many words are needed (taller than
any other Lincoln impersonator or as much electricity as Con Edison). I deal with extended
comparisons in Chapter 17. In this chapter you get to practice creating and placing one- or
two-word comparisons that make your meaning come through loud and clear (Oops! What I
meant was more loudly and more clearly).
Visiting the -ER (And the -EST): 
Creating Comparisons
Adjectives (words that describe people, places, things, or ideas) and adverbs (describing
actions, states of being, or other descriptions) are the basis of comparisons. Regular
unadorned adjectives and adverbs are the base upon which two types of comparisons may
be made: the comparative and the superlative. Comparatives (dumber, smarter, neater, more
interesting, less available, and the like) deal with only two elements. Superlatives (dumbest,
smartest, neatest, most interesting, least available, and so forth) identify the extreme in a
group of three or more. To create comparisons, follow these guidelines:
 Tack -er onto the end of a one-syllable descriptive word to create a comparative form
showing a greater or more intense quality. For descriptions of more than one syllable,
the -er may sound awkward. Generally, comparatives of long words are created by tack-
ing more onto the description. For a comparative that shows inferiority, use less.
 Glue -est to one-syllable words to make a superlative that expresses superiority. Most
does the trick for most longer words. Superlatives expressing inferiority are created
with the word least.

 Check the dictionary if you’re not sure of the correct form. The entry for the
plain adjective or adverb normally includes the comparative and superlative
forms, if they’re single words. If you don’t see a listing for another form of the
word, take the less/more, least/most option.
As you may have guessed, a few comparatives and superlatives are irregular. I discuss
these in the next section, “Going from Bad to Worse (and Good to Better): Irregular
Comparisons.”
Ready for some comparison shopping? Insert the comparative or superlative form, as
needed, into the blanks for each question. The base word is in parentheses at the end of
the sentence.
Q. Helen is the _______________ of all the women living in Troy, New York. (beautiful)
A. most beautiful or least beautiful. The sentence compares Helen to other women in Troy,
New York. Comparing more than two elements requires the superlative form. Because
beautiful is a long word, most and least create the comparison. Which should you choose?
The answer depends on your opinion of Helen’s looks. Personally, ever since the do-it-
yourself face-lift, I’m going with least.
1. Helen, who manages the billing for an auto parts company, is hoping for a transfer to the
Paris office, where the salaries are _______________ than in New York but the night life is
_______________. (low, lively)
2. Helen’s boss claims that she is the _______________ of all his employees. (efficient)
3. His secretary, however, has measured everyone’s output of P-345 forms and concluded
that Helen is _______________ than Natalie, Helen’s assistant. (slow)
4. Natalie prefers to type her P-345s because she thinks the result is _______________ than
handwritten work. (neat)
5. Helen notes that everyone else in the office writes _______________ than Natalie, whose
penmanship has been compared to random scratches from a blind chicken. (legibly)
6. Helen has been angry with Natalie ever since her assistant declared that Helen’s coffee
was _______________ than the tea that Natalie brought to the office. (drinkable)
7. Helen countered with the claim that Natalie brewed tea _______________ than the office
rules allow, a practice that makes her _______________ than Helen. (frequently, productive)
8. The other auto-parts workers are trying to stay out of the feud; they know that both
women are capable of making the work day _______________ and _______________ than it
is now. (long, boring)
9. The _______________ moment in the argument came when Natalie claimed that Helen’s
toy duck “squawked _______________ than Helen herself.” (petty, annoyingly)
10. I bought the duck for Helen myself, and it was the _______________ toy in the entire store!
(expensive)
11. Knowing about Helen’s transfer request, I asked for a duck that sounded _______________
than the average American rubber duck. (international)

13. I replied that I preferred to deal with store clerks who were _______________ than he.

14. Anyway, Helen’s transfer wasn’t approved, and she is in the _______________ mood imag-
inable. (nasty)
15. We all skirt Natalie’s desk _______________ than Helen’s, because Natalie is even
_______________ than Helen about the refusal. (widely, upset)
16. Natalie, who considers herself the _______________ person in the company, wanted a pro-
motion to Helen’s rank. (essential)
17. Larry, however, is sure that he would have gotten the promotion because he is the
_______________ of all of us in his donations to the Office Party Fund. (generous)
18. “Natalie bakes a couple of cupcakes,” he commented _______________ than the average
Mack truck, “and the boss thinks she’s executive material.” (forcefully)
19. “I, on the other hand, am the _______________ of the three clerks in my office,” he contin-
ued. (professional)
20. When I left the office, Natalie and Larry were arm wrestling to see who was
_______________. (strong)
Going from Bad to Worse (and Good 
to Better): Irregular Comparisons
A couple of basic descriptions form comparisons irregularly. Irregulars don’t add -er or
more/less to create a comparison between two elements. Nor do irregulars tack on -est or
most/least to point out the top or bottom of a group of more than two, also known as the
superlative form of comparisons. (See the preceding section, “Visiting the -ER (And the 
-EST),” for more information on comparatives and superlatives.) Instead, irregular compar-
isons follow their own strange path, as you can see in Table 16-1.

Take a stab at this section’s practice exercises, but don’t go to the -ER if your aim is

at the end of each sentence) in the blank. Just read the explanation in the answers
section of the chapter and move on.

Q. Edgar’s scrapbook, which contains souvenirs from his trip to Watch Repair Camp, is the
_______________ example of a boring book that I have ever seen. (good)
A. best. Once you mention the top or bottom experience of a lifetime, you’re in the superla-
tive column. Because goodest isn’t a word, best is the one you want.

each of which Edgar can discuss for hours. (bad)

his fourth grade class, including the teacher. (many)
26. The classroom clock functions fairly well, but Ms. Appleby relies on Edgar to make it run
even _______________. (well)
27. Edgar’s scrapbook also contains three samples of watch oil; Edgar thinks Time-Ola Oil is
the _______________ choice. (good)
28. Unfortunately, last week Edgar let a little oil drip onto his lunch and became sick; a few
hours later he felt _______________ and had to call the doctor. (ill)
29. “Time-Ola Oil is the _______________ of all the poisons,” cried the doctor. (bad)
30. “But it’s the _______________ for watches,” whispered Edgar. (good)
Words That Are Incomparable (Like You!)
Because you bought this book, I’m assuming that you (like me) are perfect. Therefore
you can’t be compared to anything or anyone else because the word perfect — as well
as unique, round, circular, right, mistaken, and a few other terms — is an absolute.
Logic, which pops up from time to time in English grammar, is the basis for this rule.
If you reach an absolute state, you can’t be more or less absolute. Therefore an
expression such as more circular or really unique is a no-no. You can, however,
approach an absolute, being, for example, nearly perfect (okay, I admit that’s a better
term for me) or almost round.
Words for direction and shape tend to be absolutes. You can turn left and but not
lefter or more left. Nor can you be the squarest or most square of them all, at least
when you’re discussing a four-sided figure.
Check out the following sentence pairs and circle the correct sentence. Just to keep
you awake, I throw in some pairs in which both sentences are wrong or both sen-
tences are right. (For those sentences, just write “both wrong” or “both right” in the
margin.)

Calling All Overachievers: Extra Practice
with Bad Comparisons
Political campaign literature is heavy with comparisons — Why Seymour and not Sally?
How much more often did Seymour vote for tax increases, compared to Sally? — but not all
the comparisons are correct. (I’m talking grammar here, not politics.) Run your eyeballs
over the campaign leaflet in Figure 16-1. It’s for a completely fictitious race between two
fifth-graders hoping for higher office, specifically, President of Grade Six. Locate and cor-
rect ten errors in comparisons. To correct the errors, you may have to rewrite an entire
sentence or phrase.
Vote for Sally!
She will be the most unique president our grade hasever had!
Here is Sally’s campaign platform:
 
¸ Our cafeteria is dirtier than the cafeterias of William Reed  
 
 
School, Mercer Prep, and Riverton.
 
¸ Sally is gooder at organizing school events than her opponent.
 
¸ Sally will collect dues most efficiently than Seymour.
 
¸ Seymour is very wrong when he says that Sally spends dues  
 
 
money on herself.
 
¸ The principal likes Sally’s ideas because compared to   
 
 
Seymour’s, hers are best.
 
¸ Seymour is most frequently absent, and the class should choose  
 
 
the candidate who will attend all school events.
 
¸ Sally’s plan for the school field will make it more square and add  
 
 
really unique bleachers.
 
¸ Seymour’s face is unattractiver than Sally’s, and you’ll have to  
 
 
look at him all day if he is president.

Chapter 16: For Better or Worse: Forming Comparisons
Answers to Comparison Problems
a
lower, livelier. The comparative form is the way to go because two cities are being compared,
Paris and New York. One-syllable words such as low form comparatives with the addition of -er.
Most two-syllable words rely on more or less, but lively is an exception. If you aren’t sure how
to form the comparative of a particular word, check the dictionary.
b
most efficient. In choosing the top or bottom rank from a group of three or more, go for
superlative. Efficient, a long word, takes most or least. In the context of this sentence, most
makes sense.
c
slower. Comparing two elements, in this case Helen and Natalie, calls for comparative form.
The one-syllable word takes -er.
d
neater. Here the sentence compares typing to handwriting, two elements, so the comparative is
correct. The one-syllable word turns comparative with the addition of -er.
e
more legibly. Once you read the word everyone, you may have thought that superlative (the
form that deals with comparisons of three or more) was needed. However, this sentence actu-
ally compares two elements (Natalie and the group composed of everyone else). Legibly has
three syllables, so more creates the comparative form.
f
less drinkable. In comparing coffee and tea, go for the comparative form. Both more drinkable
and less drinkable are correct grammatically, but Helen’s anger more logically flows from a com-
ment about her coffee’s inferiority.
g
more frequently, less productive. The fight’s getting serious now, isn’t it? Charges and counter- 
charges! Speaking solely of grammar and forgetting about office politics, each description in
this sentence is set up in comparison to one other element (how many times Natalie brews 
tea versus how many times the rules say she can brew tea, Natalie’s productiveness versus
Helen’s). Because you’re comparing two elements and the descriptions have more than one 
syllable, go for a two-word comparative.
h
longer, more boring. When you compare two things (how long and boring the day is now and
how long and boring it will be if Natalie and Helen get angry), go for the comparative, with -er
for the short word and more for the two-syllable word.
i
pettiest, more annoyingly or less annoyingly. The argument had more than two moments, so
superlative is what you want. The adjective petty has two syllables, but -est is still appropriate,
with the letter y of petty changing to i before the -est. The second blank compares two (the duck
and Helen) and thus takes the comparative. I’ll let you decide whether Natalie was insulting
Helen or the duck. Grammatically, either form is correct.
j
most expensive or least expensive. A store has lots of toys, so to choose the one that will cost
the most or least (I’ll let you decide how cheap the narrator is), go for superlative. Because
expensive has three syllables, tacking on most or least is the way to go.
k
more international. Comparing two items (the sound of the duck you want to buy and the
sound of the “average American rubber duck”) calls for comparative, which is created with
more because of the length of the adjective international.
l
silliest. Out of all the requests, this one is on the top rung. Go for superlative, which is created
by changing the y to i and adding -est.
m
less snobby. Two elements (he and a group of store clerks, with the group counting as a single
item) are being compared here, so comparative is needed. The add-on less does the job.

n
nastiest. I can imagine many moods, so the extreme in the group calls for the superlative. The
final y changes to i before the -est.
o
more widely, more upset. Employee habits concerning two individuals (Natalie and Helen) are
discussed here; comparative does the job.
p
most essential. Natalie is singled out as the extreme in a large group. Hence superlative is the
one that fits here. Three-syllable words need most to form the superlative.
q
most generous. All includes more than two (both is the preferred term for two), so superlative
rules. Go for the two-word form because generous has three syllables.
r
more forcefully. This sentence compares his force to the force of a truck. Two things in one
comparison gives you comparative form, which is created by more for long words.
s
most professional. Choosing one out of three calls for superlative. (One out of two is compara-
tive, as in more professional.)
t
stronger. Natalie and Larry are locked in a fight to the death (okay, to the strained elbow). Two
elements being compared requires comparative. Because strong is a single syllable, tacking on 
-er does the trick.
u
more. Two elements are being compared here: the amount of detail Edgar uses and the amount
of detail people want. When comparing two elements, the comparative form rules.
v
worst. The superlative form singles out the extreme (in this case the most boring) item in the
scrapbook.
w
better. The sentence pits Edgar’s skills against the skills of one group (the downtown jewelers).
Even though the group has several members, the comparison is between two elements —
Edgar and the group — so comparative form is what you want.
x
worse. Two states of being are in comparison in this sentence, Edgar’s health before and after
he hears about a broken watch. In comparing two things, go for comparative form.
y
most. The superlative form singles out the extreme, in this case Edgar’s timepiece collection,
which included even a raw-potato clock until it rotted.
A
better. The comparative deals with two states — how the clock runs before Edgar gets his
hands on it and how it runs after.
B
best. To single out the top or bottom rank from a group of more than two, go for superlative form.
C
worse. The sentence compares Edgar’s health at two points (immediately after eating the oil
spill and a few hours after that culinary adventure). Comparative form works for two elements.
D
worst. The very large group of poisons has two extremes, and Time-Ola is one of them, so
superlative form is best.
E
best. The group of watch oils also has two extremes, and Time-Ola is one of them, so once again
you need superlative.
F
Sentence B. Because round is absolute, the term rounder isn’t standard English.
G
Sentences A and B. Two absolutes are in question here: circular and mistaken. The words
tacked on to the absolutes (probably in Sentence A and nearly in Sentence B) don’t express a
degree of circularity or mistakenness. Instead, probably expresses an opinion about whether or
not the absolute term applies, and nearly expresses an approach to the absolute.
212
Part IV: All You Need to Know about Descriptions and Comparisons 

H
Sentence A. You can’t go more west. The direction is absolute.
I
Sentence B. Because unique is an absolute term, most unique is illogical. Unusual, on the other
hand, isn’t absolute, so most may be attached.
J
neither. The shape is either circular or not. The reasonably in sentence A is a no-no, as is the
very in sentence B.
K
Sentences A and B. I tried to trick you here by sneaking in a non-absolute, elderly. You can be
very, extremely, really, and not-so elderly, depending upon your birth certificate and your degree
of truthfulness.
L
Sentence B. Right is an absolute, so you’re either right or wrong, not very right or wronger. You
can, however, be just right, implying that you have reached the absolute state.
M
Sentences A and B. Perfect is an absolute, but almost expresses an approach to the absolute
(legal) and surprisingly deals with the opinion of the speaker, not with a degree of perfection
(also legal).
N
neither. Mistaken is an absolute, so more and very are wrong. (Not wronger, or very wrong,
because wrong is also an absolute.)
O
Sentences A and B. If the button is uniquely suited, nothing else in the universe is suited in the
same way. No problem. Uncommonly means that more than one item may be suited, but this
button fits to a rare degree. Also no problem.

Chapter 16: For Better or Worse: Forming Comparisons

P
Unique is an absolute and can’t be compared.
Q
In comparing more than two elements, use the superlative (dirtiest).
R
Better is an irregular comparison. Gooder isn’t a word in standard English.
S
In comparing two items (the way Sally gets the money from her classmates and the way
Seymour does), go for comparative, not superlative form.
T
Wrong is an absolute and may not be compared.
U
The comparative form (better) works for a two-element comparison.
V
The implied comparison here is between two attendance records, so comparative form is what
you want.
W
Square is an absolute and may not be compared. You may, however, state how close to the
absolute a particular form is.
X
The absolute term unique may not be compared.
Y
A three-syllable word becomes comparative or superlative with the addition of more/less or
most/least.

Apples and Oranges: 
Improper Comparisons
In This Chapter
 Avoiding incomplete or illogical comparisons
 Handling double comparisons
You can’t compare apples and oranges, according to the old saying, but that error is
only one of many common comparison mistakes. Sitting in the bleachers at Yankee
Stadium, I once heard a fan compare the Yankee shortstop, Derek Jeter, to “the Yankee play-
ers.” The imaginary umpire I conjured up, the one who knows the rules of grammar as thor-
oughly as the rules of baseball, immediately screamed, “Foul! You should have compared
Jeter to ‘the other Yankee players.’” (The real me kept her mouth shut. My reputation for
nerdiness is bad enough as it is.)
Chapter 16 explains one- or two-word comparisons; this chapter takes you through more
complicated situations, including illogical comparisons like the Jeter comment and incom-
plete comparisons. You can also practice double comparisons, a sentence construction for
people who like to hedge their bets. As they say in Yankee Stadium, play ball!
No One Likes to Feel Incomplete, 
and Neither Do Comparisons
By definition, a comparison discusses two elements in relation to each other or singles out
the extreme in a group and explains exactly what form the extremism takes. For example,
She throws more pies than I do or Of all the clowns, she throws the most pies. A comparison
may also examine something in relation to a standard, as in Her comment was so sugary that
I had to take an extra shot of diabetes medication.
A comparison may be any of these things, but what it may not be is partially absent. If some-
one says, “The snapper is not as fresh” or “The sea bass is most musical,” you’re at sea. As
fresh as what? Most musical in comparison to whom? You have no way of knowing.
Of course, in context these sentences may be perfectly all right:
I considered the snapper but in the end went with the flounder. The snapper is not as
fresh.

In the preceding example, the reader understands that the second sentence is a con-
tinuation of the first. Also, some words in a comparison may be implied, without loss
of meaning. Take a look at this sentence:
The snapper makes fewer snotty comments than a large-mouth bass does.
The italicized word in the preceding sentence may be left out — and frequently is —
without confusing the reader. And that’s the key: The reader must have enough infor-
mation to understand the comparison.
So may also mean therefore, in which case it doesn’t pair with that. In informal speech,
so may also be the equivalent of very, as in I was so tired. In formal English, however, so
should be paired with that when it creates a comparison.
Read the following sentence; see whether you can catch an incomplete comparison. If
the sentence is correct, write “correct” in the blank. If not, rewrite the sentence to
complete the comparison. You may come up with thousands of possible answers, a
further illustration of why incomplete comparisons make for poor communication. I
give two suggested answers for the example, but only one suggested answer for the
exercises that follow, because I can’t cover everything. Check your answer by deter-
mining whether your comparison is clear and complete.
Q. “There are more fish in the sea,” commented the grouper as she searched for her posse.

A. “There are more fish in the sea than you know,” commented the grouper as she
searched for her posse. Or, “There are more fish in the sea than on a restaurant menu,”
commented the grouper as she searched for her posse. The key here is to define the
term more. More than what? If you answer that question, you’re fine.

Being Smarter Than Yourself: 
Illogical Comparisons
If I say that my favorite Yankee, Derek Jeter, is cuter than the Yankee players or better
at turning double plays than the Yankees, I’m making an error that’s a lot worse than
Derek’s occasional wild throw into the stands. Why? Because Derek is one of the play-
ers on the Yankees. According to the logic of those statements, Derek would have to
be cuter or better than himself. The solution is simple. Insert other or else or a similar
expression into the sentence. Then Derek becomes cuter than anyone else on the team
or better at turning double plays than the other Yankees.
Don’t insert other or else if the comparison is between someone in the group and
someone outside the group. I can correctly say that Derek is cuter than the Red Sox
players because Derek isn’t a Red Sox player and he is cute.
Another form of illogic that pops up in comparisons is overkill: the use of both -er and
more or less or -est and most or least. You can be either sillier or more silly, but not
more sillier.

Double Trouble: A Sentence Containing 
More Than One Comparison
Do you have trouble making up your mind? Well, yes and no. Does this statement
sound like something you’d say? If so, you probably employ double comparisons.
Some examples:
The new sculpture is as fragile as the old one, if not more fragile.
Eleanor is almost as annoying as Sarah, if not equally annoying.
Carrie’s speech on tariff reduction was as complicated as, if not more complicated
than, Jessica’s oration.
The preceding examples are correct because each falls into one of two categories:
 The first comparison is completed before the second begins. The first two sen-
tences in the preceding example set follow this pattern.
 The beginning of both comparisons may be logically completed by the phrase
at the end of the sentence. The third sample sentence in the preceding set falls
into this category. The first comparison in that sentence begins with the state-
ment as complicated as. Tack that statement to the conclusion of the compari-
son, Jessica’s oration, and you have a complete and logical comparison: as
complicated as Jessica’s oration. The second comparison begins with more com-
plicated than and is completed by the same statement, Jessica’s oration. Thus the
second comparison is complete: more complicated than Jessica’s oration. Because
both comparisons are completed by the same phrase, the sentence is correct.
219
Chapter 17: Apples and Oranges: Improper Comparisons

The most common mistake in double comparisons is to omit part of the first comparison:
Wrong: Carrie’s speech on tariff reduction was as complicated, if not more com-
plicated than, Jessica’s oration.
Why it’s wrong: Each comparison must be completed by the same phrase at the
end of the sentence. In the preceding sample sentence, the first comparison is not
completed by the phrase at the end of the sentence. The way it is now, the first
comparison reads as complicated Jessica’s oration. The word as is missing.
Right: Carrie’s speech on tariff reduction was as complicated as, if not more com-
plicated than, Jessica’s oration.
Also right: Carrie’s speech on tariff reduction was as complicated as Jessica’s ora-
tion, if not more complicated.
Double comparisons are so annoying that you may be tempted to make up your mind and
go for one statement only. I applaud that decision. But if you must give two alternatives, be
sure that each is correct. Here’s an example and a practice set of exercises. If you find an
error, rewrite the sentence. Note: More than one correction is possible with this sort of
error. Just pick one way to rewrite.
Q. Celeste put as many people — if not even more people — to sleep as Elizabeth, even
though Celeste’s speech was five minutes shorter.
A. Celeste put as many people to sleep as Elizabeth, if not even more than Elizabeth, even
though Celeste’s speech was five minutes shorter. The two comparisons should be logi-
cally completed by the same phrase, but in the original sentence, the second comparison
is faulty. The first comparison, Celeste put as many people to sleep as Elizabeth, is okay.
The second comparison in the original sentence, If not even more people to sleep as
Elizabeth, is illogical. The word than is missing. The corrected version supplies two com-
plete comparisons.
21. Celeste described every, or even more than, the provisions of the Snooty-Harvey 
Tariff Law.

22. Elizabeth concentrated on one of the most, if not the most important, provisions of

Calling All Overachievers: Extra Practice
with Improper Comparisons
Figure 17-1 is an excerpt from a completely fictitious review of an imaginary restaurant,
which I designed to give you a thorough review of the rules of comparisons. Be on the look-
out for undercooked sausage, incomplete or illogical comparisons, snobby waiters, and
messed-up double comparisons. You should find ten mistakes in comparisons and about a
million reasons not to eat at this establishment. Correcting the errors may involve adding,
removing, or rearranging quite a few words. Note: Often more than one correction is possi-
ble. I supply one answer for each error in the following section, but your answer may differ
slightly and still be correct.
Pembroke Diner: You Won’t Go Broke, but You Won’t Eat Well Either
A recent meal at the Pembroke Diner on 48th Street was most 
distressing. First of all, the tables are as close together, if not closer 
together, than bus riders during rush hour. I truly did not want to hear my 
neighbors’ conversation about their grandchildren, who are, they claim, 
so smart. Nor did I want to chew each bite of steak for ten minutes 
because the steak was tougher than any meat I’ve eaten in my life. The 
wine list of the Pembroke is the least interesting. I am, I admit, a wine 
snob, but even people who drink wine only once a year will have a hard 
time finding something that is as watery, if not more watery, than the 
house red. I was surprised to realize that I was less impressed than the 
diners munching happily in the restaurant. Surely the Pembroke can do 
better! The potato was much more raw and more expensive. I 
recommend that you find a place with better food. The Pembroke must 
revise its menu and its habits immediately, or the restaurant will be so 
unpopular.

Chapter 17: Apples and Oranges: Improper Comparisons

Answers to Complicated 
Comparison Problems
a
The trout, who is wealthier than the president of a Swiss bank, spends a lot of money on rap
CDs. The problem with the original is that you can’t tell what or who is being compared to the
trout. The missing element of the comparison must be supplied.
b
The octopus has almost as much money as the trout but prefers to keep the trout at arm’s
length. The original sentence begins the comparison nicely (almost as much money as) and
then flubs the ending (almost as much money as what? as who?). Supply an ending and 
you’re fine.
c
Mermaids are the most adept at financial planning of all marine mammals, in my experi-
ence. The original comparison doesn’t specify the group in which mermaids excel. Your answer
must provide context.
d
On the other hand, mermaids are less competent at purchasing shoes than other mammals.
In the original, the reader is left to wonder about the basis of comparison. In the corrected sen-
tence, the mermaids are compared to other mammals. Now the comparison is complete.
e
Not many people realize that mermaid tail fins are as sensitive as a duck’s foot. The original
sentence contains an incomplete comparison. As sensitive as what? Who knows? The sug-
gested answer finishes the comparison by supplying another sensitive object.
f
Whales are as fashion-challenged at shoe and accessory selection as mermaids. It doesn’t
matter how you finish the comparison so long as you finish it. In the suggested answer I
plugged in mermaids, but I could just as easily have placed myself or someone else. Your call.
g
This whole under-the-sea theme has become more boring than a lecture on the economics 
of pen nibs. Finish the comparison with your favorite example of excruciating boredom.
h
The marine jokes are so uninteresting that I may never go to the beach again. The so state-
ment must be completed by some sort of that statement.
i
correct. Let me explain. Normally a comparison (harder, in this sentence) must be placed in
context. In this sentence, however, the context is implied (harder than I did before).
j
correct. The phrase less than satisfying compares the comedy to an ideal state (satisfying). The
comparison is complete.
k
Despite the fact that they don’t use Metrocards, subway pigeons are no worse than any other
rider. The context makes clear that pigeons sometimes ride the subways. (I’m not kidding
about this one, honest! I have seen the little feathered guys on my train.) Without the other,
pigeons are no worse than themselves, an impossible situation.
l
Spotting a pigeon waiting for the subway door to open is no odder than anything else you
see on an average day in New York. The else serves an important purpose in this sentence; it
shows the reader that the pigeon waiting for the subway is being compared to other events in
New York City. Without the else, the sentence is irrational because then the sentence means
that seeing pigeons in New York is no odder than what you see in New York.
m
On a midtown corner I once saw a woman shampooing her hair in the rain, an experience
that was weirder than anything else I’ve seen in my life. More weirder is overkill. Drop the
more and you’re all set.
222

Singing a shower song with a thick New York accent, she appeared saner than other city 
residents. If she’s got a New York accent, she’s a city resident. Without the word other, you’re
saying that she’s saner than herself. Not possible!

Is this story less believable than the rest of what you read in this book? The story is in the

You may be surprised to know that it is more firmly fact-based than the other material in
this chapter. Your correction must indicate, in any of several ways, that this story is being com-
pared to the rest of the dumb jokes I placed in this chapter. The expressions other, rest, or any-
thing else can do the job.
r
Tourists to New York probably go home with stranger stories than visitors to other big cities.
New York is a big city, but the original sentence implies otherwise. The insertion of other solves
the problem.
s
New Yorkers themselves, of course, make worse tourists than travelers from other large met-
ropolitan areas. New York is a large metropolitan area, and the original indicates that it isn’t.
Trouble! Insert other and you’re all set.
t
correct. New Yorkers are compared to residents of small towns, and that comparison is legal
u
Celeste described every provision of the Snooty-Harvey Tariff Law, and even more. The orig-
inal sentence muddles two comparisons, braiding them together inappropriately. The first com-
parison is incomplete. If you untangle it, you get Celeste described every the provisions of the
Snooty-Harvey Tariff Law. You can easily see that the untangled comparison doesn’t make sense.
The second comparison is in better shape. Untangled it reads Celeste described even more than
the provisions of the Snooty-Harvey Tariff Law. One complete and one incomplete comparison
isn’t a good idea. The corrected version presents two complete ideas.
v
Elizabeth concentrated on one of the most important, if not the most important, provisions
of the law. Or, Elizabeth concentrated on one of the most important provisions of the law, if
not the most important. The original is faulty because the first comparison cannot be com-
pleted logically by the words supplied in the sentence. In the original sentence, the first com-
parison reads one of the most provisions of the law. Penalty box! The word important is missing.
The two corrections supply important.
w
Celeste’s choice of subject matter was equally important, if not more important than
Elizabeth’s. In the original sentence, the first comparison is incomplete: equally Elizabeth’s. In
the rewritten version, each separate comparison makes sense. Comparison one: equally impor-
tant. Comparison two: more important than Elizabeth’s.
x
Elizabeth insisted on the same amount of time as Celeste, or even more time than Celeste. 
In the original sentence the second comparison is incomplete as written. The than is missing. 
In the corrected version each of the two comparisons works separately. Comparison one: the
same amount of time as Celeste. Comparison two: more time than Celeste.
y
Celeste’s demand for a bowl of pink jellybeans during the lecture was as ridiculous as
Elizabeth’s request for green gummy bears, if not more ridiculous. In the original sentence the
first comparison is incomplete because it contains only one as. If you untangle it from the second
comparison, you hear what’s missing: Celeste’s demand for a bowl of pink jellybeans during the lec-
ture was as ridiculous than Elizabeth’s request for green gummy bears. The corrected version con-
tains two complete comparisons.

The expression most distressing must be placed in context. Your answer probably differs from

Pembroke Diner: You Won’t Go Broke, but You Won’t Eat Well Either
A recent meal at the Pembroke Diner on 48th Street was most 
distressing  the most distressing experience I’ve had since becoming 
a restaurant critic. First of all, the tables are as close together, if not 
closer together, than bus riders during rush hour  as close together 
as bus riders during rush hour, if not closer. I truly did not want to hear 
my neighbors’ conversation about their grandchildren, who are, they claim, 
so smart that no IQ test can measure them. Nor did I want to chew 
each bite of steak for ten minutes because the steak was tougher than 
any other meat I’ve eaten in my life. The wine list of the Pembroke is the 
least interesting of all the restaurants in the universe that serve wine. 
I am, I admit, a wine snob, but even people who drink wine only once a 
year will have a hard time finding something that is as watery, if not more 
watery, than the house red as watery as the house red, if not more 
watery. I was surprised to realize that I was less impressed than the other 
diners munching happily in the restaurant. Surely the Pembroke can do 
better! The potato was much more raw than an uncooked steak and 
more expensive than filet mignon. I recommend that you find a place 
with better food. The Pembroke must revise its menu and its habits 
immediately, or the restaurant will be so unpopular that it will go out of 
business.

you’ve arrived at the top. The topics in this part include
more than grammar; and when you master them, your
writing will be as stylish as a supermodel.
Chapter 18 tackles parallelism, the grammar term for
order and balance in a sentence. (In fashion terms, how
not to wear rain boots with an evening gown.) Chapter 19
lets you practice adding variety to sentences, so you don’t
end up wearing the same outfit . . . er, structuring every
sentence the same way. Chapter 20 concerns the little
errors (like wearing something that isn’t black in New York
City) that sabotage your writing.

ath teachers have all the luck. Not only can they play with compasses and protrac-
tors, but they also get to draw little circles and squares and parallel lines. English has
parallels too, but in grammar, parallels are created with words, not with pencils and rulers.
No fun at all!
Grammatical parallelism may not be party material, but it’s essential to good writing.
Parallelism refers to order and balance, the quality a sentence has when it flows smoothly.
No parallel sentence starts out in one direction (toward, say, Grandma’s house) only to veer
suddenly off the road (perhaps to a biker convention two states away). This chapter pro-
vides a road map and some practice drives to keep your sentences on track.
Geometry Invades English: Parallelism Basics
When a sentence is parallel, everything performing the same function in the sentence has
the same grammatical identity. If you have two subjects, for example, and one is an infinitive
(to ski), the other one will be an infinitive also (to fracture). You can’t mix and match; to ski
and fracturing shouldn’t show up as paired (or part of tripled or quadrupled or whatever)
subjects. Check these sentences out:
Nonparallel: Roberta didn’t enjoy paying full price for a lift ticket and that the cashier
treated her rudely.
Parallel: Roberta didn’t enjoy paying full price for a lift ticket and being treated rudely
by the cashier.
In checking for parallelism, don’t worry about terminology. Just read the sentence aloud
and listen: Parallel sentences sound balanced, but nonparallel sentences sound lopsided.
Keep your balance while you check out the following sentences. Decide whether or not
they’re parallel. If they are, write “correct” in the blank after each sentence. If they’re non-
parallel, correct the sentence in the blanks provided.

Q. Sliding down Thunder Mountain, artfully spraying snow across his rival’s face, and to get

________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
A. Sliding down Thunder Mountain, artfully spraying snow across his rival’s face, and get-
ting the best seat in the ski lodge were Robert’s goals for the afternoon. The sentence
has three subjects. The first two subjects are verb forms ending in -ing (gerunds, in official
grammar terminology), but the third is an infinitive (the to form of a verb). Mismatch! My
suggested answer makes all three subjects into gerunds. Here’s another possibility: To
slide down Thunder Mountain, to spray snow artfully across his rival’s face, and to get the
best seat in the ski lodge were Robert’s goals for the afternoon. Now all are infinitives, and
the sentence is parallel.

Avoiding Unnecessary Shifts 
in Tense, Person, and Voice
My driving instructor (my husband) patiently explained to me at least 1,000 times that
shifting at the wrong time was bad for (a) the engine and (b) his nerves. I did my best,
though the grinding noise that echoed through the car wasn’t always my teeth.
Sentences should stay in gear also, unless the meaning requires a shift. Every sentence has
tense (the time of the action or state of being), person (who’s talking or being talked
about), and voice (active or passive). A sentence has a parallelism problem when one of
those qualities shifts unnecessarily from, say, present to past tense, or from first person
(the I form) to third (the he or they form). Nor should a sentence drift from singular to
plural without good reason. For help with verbs, check out Chapters 1 and 2. Pronoun tips
are in Chapters 3 and 11.
Some shifts are crucial to the meaning of the sentence. If I hit you and then he hits me, the
shift from one person to another is part of what I’m trying to say. That sort of sentence is
fine. What’s not parallel is a statement like I hit him because you always want to be aggres-
sive in tight situations, where the you is a stand-in for I or everyone.
Hop in for a test ride. Check out the following sentences. If everything’s okay, write “cor-
rect” in the blank after each sentence. Rewrite the nonparallel sentences so they’re correct.
Q. Miranda read her introduction, and then the slides of our trip to Morocco were shown 
by me.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
A. Miranda read her introduction, and then I showed the slides of our trip to Morocco.
The original sentence unwisely shifts from active voice (Miranda read) to passive 
(slides . . . were shown). Verdict: Stripped gears, caused by a lack of parallelism.

Matchmaking 101: Either/Or, Not 
Only/But Also, and Similar Pairs
Like dating couples, some words that join ideas (conjunctions, in grammar-speak)
arrive in pairs. Specifically, either/or, neither/nor, not only/but also, and both/and work
as teams. Also like daters, these conjunction pairs tend to drift apart. Your job is to
keep them together by ensuring that they link parallel elements. All you have to do is
check that the elements being linked by these words have the same grammatical iden-
tity (two nouns, two noun-verb combos, two adjectives, or two whatevers). Check out
the following examples, in which the linked elements are underlined and the conjunc-
tions are italicized:
Nonparallel: Gertrude was not only anxious to achieve fame but also she wanted
to make a lot of money.
Parallel: Either by going to the moon or by swimming across the Pacific, Gertrude
is determined to become famous.
The linked elements in the parallel example are both prepositional phrases. (You
don’t really need to know the grammatical term.) If you say the underlined sections
aloud, your ear tells you that they match. In the nonparallel sentence, the first ele-
ment is just a description, but the second contains a subject-verb combo that could
stand alone as a complete sentence. Clearly these two aren’t going to make it through
dinner and a movie. Nor can you correct the problem by deleting she from the non-
parallel sentence, because then you’re pairing a description with a verb. Divorce
court looms!
A good way to check parallelism in this sort of sentence is to underline the elements,
as I do in the preceding example sentences. Then you can focus on whether or not
they match.

________________________________________________________________________________
A. Both the bird that swooped over my head and the surprise that I found in the garbage
pail startled me. In the original sentence, swooping over my head and surprise in the
garbage pail don’t match. The first element has a verb (swooping), and the second 
doesn’t. The corrected version matches bird that swooped to surprise that I found.

Calling All Overachievers: Extra 
Practice with Parallels
Look for any parallelism problems in this letter to an elected official from an unfortu-
nate citizen (see Figure 18-1). You should find ten mistakes in parallelism, various
shifts, and conjunction pairs. When you find a mistake, correct it.
Dear Mr. Mayor:
I do not like complaining or to be a nuisance, but if a person is 
persecuted, they should be heard. As you know, the proposed new 
highway not only runs through my living room but into my swimming pool 
as well. When I spoke to the Department of Highways, the clerk was rude 
and that he took my complaint lightly. He said I should either be glad the 
road didn’t touch the breakfast nook or the kitchen. I demand that the 
issue be taken seriously by you. I have written to you three times already, 
and you will say that you are “working on the problem.” I am angry and in 
the mood to take legal action. Moving the highway or to cancel it entirely 
is the only solution. I expect you to cooperate and that you will fire the 
clerk.
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

Chapter 18: Practicing Parallel Structure
Answers to Parallelism Problems
a
The ski pants that Robert favors are green, skin tight, and stretchy. The original sentence
links two adjectives (green and skin-tight) with a verb form (made of stretch fabric). Two adjec-
tives + one verb form = penalty box. The corrected version relies on three adjectives (green,
skin-tight, and stretchy) to describe Robert’s favorite pants. (In case you’re wondering why he
finds it hard to get a date, think about his wardrobe.)
b
When he eases into those pants and zips up with great difficulty, Robert feels cool. The origi-
nal sentence isn’t parallel because the and joins two verbs (eases and zipping) that don’t match.
In the corrected version, and links eases and zips. In fact, these verb forms are so well suited to
each other that they planned a date for Saturday night. Another possible correction: Easing into
those pants and zipping up with great difficulty, Robert feels cool. Now easing parallels zipping.
c
In this ski outfit, Robert can breathe only with great difficulty and loudness. The original
sentence matches up difficulty (a noun) and loudly (a description). These two are headed for
the divorce court. The correction pairs two nouns (difficulty and loudness).
d
The sacrifice for the sake of fashion is worth the trouble and discomfort, Robert says. The
clunker (the original sentence) joins a noun, trouble, and a whole clause (that’s the grammar
term for a subject/verb combo), how he feels uncomfortable. Not parallel! The correction links
two nouns, trouble and discomfort.
e
correct. The sentence yokes two -ing forms (sliding and coasting). Verdict: legal.
f
Robert has often been known to object to secondhand clothing and used equipment. You’re
okay with two nouns (clothing and equipment). You’re not okay with a noun (clothing) and a
clause (how some equipment is used), which is what you had in the original sentence.
g
“With a good parka or a warm face mask, I’m ready for anything,” he says. The or in the orig-
inal sentence links with a good parka and wearing a warm face mask. The second term includes
a verb form (wearing), and the first doesn’t, so you know that the parallelism is off. In the cor-
rection, parka and face mask are linked. Because they’re both nouns, the parallelism works.
h
The face mask is useful on the slopes and does double duty in bank robberies. The original
sentence isn’t parallel because is useful and doing don’t match. The corrected sentence pairs is
and does, two verbs, so it’s fine.
i
The ski pants can also be recycled, if they are ripless and clean. Ripless is an adjective, but
without stains is a phrase. Penalty box! The corrected version has two adjectives (ripless and
clean).
j
However, bank robbery and simple street muggings are more difficult in ski pants. In the
correction I match two nouns (robbery and muggings), but you could also go for two infinitives
(to rob a bank and to mug someone). Just be sure the two subjects have the same grammatical
identity.
k
Robbers need speed and privacy, but they also need pockets. The original sentence falls off
the parallel tracks because speed is a noun and to be private is an infinitive. The correction
joins two nouns, speed and privacy.
l
How to stash stolen money and where to put an unwanted ski mask are important issues. 
In the correction, the subjects are both clauses; that is, they’re both expressions containing
subjects and verbs. (Think of a clause as a mini-sentence that can sometimes, but not always,
stand alone.) Two clauses = legal pairing. The original sentence derails because the first subject
(stashing stolen money) is a gerund, and the second is based on an infinitive (to put).

238
Part V: Writing with Style 
m
Robert, who is actually quite honest and not inclined to rob anyone, nevertheless thinks
about crime and fashion. The original sentence links a plain-vanilla-no-sprinkles description
(honest) with an -ing verb form (not having the inclination to rob anyone). No sale. The answer
matches two descriptions, honest and inclined.
n
He once wrote and edited a newsletter called Crimes of Fashion. The answer matches two
past tense verbs, wrote and edited. The original matched a past (wrote) and a past perfect (had
edited) without any valid reason for a different tense, so it wasn’t parallel.
o
To ski and to pursue a career in law enforcement are Robert’s dreams. Pair two infinitives (to
ski and to pursue) and you’re fine. Or, pair skiing and pursuing for an alternate correct answer.
p
If you’ve studied biology, you know that a person must learn the names of hundreds, if 
not thousands, of organisms. The original sentence shifts from anyone (third person) to you
(second person). The correction stays in second. Another possible fix pairs anyone with he or
she knows — all third-person forms.
q
correct. Two questions. No shifts, no problem.
r
The Amoeba Family provides a good example of the process, so I will explain its name. The
original sentence shifts unnecessarily from active (provides) to passive (will be explained). The
corrected sentence stays in active voice. True, it contains a shift from third person (talking
about the Amoeba Family) to first, but that shift is justified by meaning.
s
You may not know that the first example of this single-celled organism was named Amy. 
The original sentence shifts inappropriately from present tense (may not know) to conditional
(would have). The tenses in the correction make more sense; the first part is present and the
second past, because you may not know right now about something that happened previously.
The shift is there, but it’s justified by meaning. The correction has another shift, also justified,
from active (may not know) to passive (was named). Because the person giving the name is
unknown, the passive must be used.
t
When they split in half, the new organisms name themselves. The question sentence is non-
parallel because it moves from the second person you to the third person organisms. The cor-
rection stays in third person (talking about someone), with they and organisms.
u
The right half of Amy still called herself Amy, but the left half now called herself Bea. In the
original, the extra by in the first half of the sentence unbalances the sentence. The correction
eliminated the problem by making both parts of the sentence active.
v
The next time Amy and Bea split, they formed four new organisms. Parallel statements
should stay in one person, in this case third person, talking about Amy, Bea, and they.
w
No one can imagine a conference between four single-celled organisms unless he or she wit-
nesses it. The issue here is singular/plural pronouns. The original sentence begins with the sin-
gular no one and then shifts illegally to they, a plural. The correction begins with singular (no
one again) and stays singular (he or she).
x
Amy Right Half favored a name that people would notice. The first verb in the original is
past, but the second shifts illogically to the future. Penalty box. In the correction, the past tense
favored is matched with a conditional (would notice), but that change is logical because Amy is
attaching a condition to her choice of name.
y
Amy Left Half thought about the choice for so long that she neglected her swimming. Why
change from active (thought) to passive (was neglected)? Two actives work better.

239
Chapter 18: Practicing Parallel Structure
A
Bea Right Half, a proto-feminist, opted for “Amy-Bea,” because she wanted to honor both
her parents. The original sentence has a meaningless tense shift, from past (opted) to present
(wants). The correction stays in past tense (opted, wanted).
B
Everyone always pronounced “Amy-Bea” very fast, and soon “Amoeba” was the preferred
spelling. The original sentence shifts from singular (everyone) to plural (their). The answer
avoids the problem by dropping the second pronoun entirely.
C
Single-celled organisms should have simple names that biology students can remember. The
shift from active in the original (should have) to passive (can be remembered) isn’t a good idea.
The verbs in the correction (should have, can remember) stay active, jogging for at least an
hour a day.
D
Bea Left Half, by the way, will change her name to Amy-Bea when she reaches the age of
seventeen days. The original contains an illogical tense shift. The first verb is future (will
change) and the second is past (reached), placing the sentence in some sort of time warp and
out of the realm of parallel structure. In the correction, both actions are in the future (will
change, when she reaches).
E
You know what teenagers are like; they always have to assert their identities. The corrected
sentence stays in plural (teenagers, they), but the original improperly shifts from singular (a
teenager) to plural (they).
F
When she traveled to the biker convention, Lola intended both to show off her new Harley
and to display her new tattoo. The paired conjunction here is both/and. The correction pairs
two infinitives (to show off and to display), in contrast to the original sentence, which joins a
noun (her new Harley) and an infinitive (to display her new tattoo).
G
Lulu would either accompany Lola or stay home to work on a screenplay about bikers. The
elements joined by either/or in the original sentence don’t match. One is a subject-verb combo
(Lulu would accompany) and one just a verb (stay). The new version links two verbs (accom-
pany and stay).
H
Neither Lulu nor Lola plans ahead. The corrected sentence links two nouns (Lulu, Lola) with
the neither/nor conjunction pair. The original sentence fails the parallelism test because it links
a subject-verb (Lulu plans) with a noun (Lola).
I
Lola writes screenplays not only about bikers but about alien invasions also. The original
isn’t parallel because the first element joined by not only/but also includes a verb (writes) but
the second doesn’t. The new version joins two prepositional phrases.
J
Lulu is jealous of both Lola’s writing talent and the award for “best cycle” on Lola’s trophy
wall. Here you’re working with both/and. In the original sentence both precedes is, a verb, but
no verb follows the and. In the correction, each half of the conjunction pair precedes a noun
(talent, award).
K
Lola not only scorns awards but also refuses to enter most contests. The conjunction pair, not
only/but also, links two verbs in the answer sentence (scorns, refuses). The original sentence

L
correct. The neither/nor combo precedes two nouns in the sentence (award, trophy). Verdict:
parallel.
M
Lulu, on the other hand, wants both the cycling award and the trophy. In the original sen-
tence, both comes before a verb (wants), but and precedes a noun (trophy). Penalty box. The
new version does better, linking two nouns (award, trophy).

Part V: Writing with Style 
N
Not only did Lulu bribe the judges, but she also ran a full-page ad bragging about herself.
The two conjunctions (not only/but also) link subject-verb combos in the corrected version (did
Lulu bribe, she ran), but in the original these conjunctions link a subject-verb and a verb (did
Lulu bribe, ran). Verdict: Five to ten in the grammar penitentiary.
O
Either the judges were unimpressed with Lulu’s efforts or they liked Lola better. The either/
or pair in the corrected sentence connects two complete sentences (the judges were unimpressed
and they liked Lola better). In the original, a description (unimpressed) incorrectly follows either,
but a verb (liked) follows or.
P
You may change complaining to to complain, as I did, or you may change to be to being. Either
way makes a parallel sentence.
Q
A person is singular, but they is plural. I change they to the singular he or she, but if you want to
keep they, you may scrap a person and insert people instead.
R
Each part of the not only/but also pair should precede a prepositional phrase.
S
The and may link was and took, two verbs, but not a verb (was) and a subject-verb combo (he
took). Another way to correct this sentence is to select an adjective to replace he took my com-
plaint lightly — dismissive, flippant, disrespectful, or a similar word. Then the verb was precedes
two adjectives, rude and dismissive, perhaps.
T
After the correction, each half of the conjunction pair either/or precedes a noun. In the original,
the either comes before a verb (be) and the or before a noun.
Dear Mr. Mayor:
I do not like complaining  to complain or to be a nuisance, but if a 
person is persecuted, they he or she should be heard. As you know, the 
proposed new highway not only runs not only through my living room but 
into my swimming pool as well. When I spoke to the Department of 
Highways, the clerk was rude and that he took my complaint lightly. He 
said I should either be glad the road didn’t touch either the breakfast nook 
or the kitchen. I demand that the issue be taken seriously by you you 
take the issue seriously. I have written to you three times already, and 
you will say said that you are “working on the problem.” I am angry and 
in the mood ready to take legal action. Moving the highway 
To move the highway or to cancel it entirely is the only solution. I expect 
you to cooperate and that you will to fire the clerk.
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

Chapter 18: Practicing Parallel Structure
U
The original sentence switches from active (I demand) to passive (be taken . . . by you). The
corrected version avoids the shift.
V
The original shifts from present perfect tense (have written) to future (will say) for no good
reason. The correction is in past tense, but that tense is justified by the meaning of the sentence.
W
Angry is an adjective, but in the mood is a phrase. Ready, an adjective, makes the sentence 
parallel.
X
Either two infinitives (my correction) or two -ing forms (Moving and canceling) are acceptable
here, but not one of each.
Y
Two infinitives (to cooperate, to fire) are legal, as are two subject-verb combinations (that you
will cooperate and that you will fire) but not one of each.

Compare the above paragraph to the next paragraph:
I am writing. The rain beats down on my window. I am glad that I am not outside. I am smil-
ing. I type away. I am dry and cozy.
Okay, admit it. The first version is better. Why? Because variety is not only the spice of life
but the spice of writing as well. In this chapter you practice adding variety to your sen-
tences by altering the underlying structure and combining ideas. You also get some scissor
practice by cutting repetitive or awkward expressions.
Beginning with a Bang: Adding 
Introductory Elements
The spine of most English sentences is subject-verb: Mary walks, Oliver opens, and so forth.
Most sentences also have some sort of completion, what grammarians call a complement or
an object: Mary walks the dog, Oliver opens the peanut butter.
Even when you throw in some descriptions, this basic skeleton is boring if it’s the only struc-
ture you ever use. The easiest and most effective way to change the basic pattern is to add an
introductory element, which is italicized in the following examples:
Sticking her finger in the jar, Agnes curdled the peanut butter. (The introductory verb
form tells something Agnes did.)
Despite the new polish on her nails, Agnes was willing to eat without a fork. (The intro-
ductory phrase gives information about Agnes’s willingness to get down and dirty with
the peanut butter.)
When she was full, Agnes closed the jar. (The introductory statement has a subject and a
verb, she was, and in grammar terms is a clause. Once again, you get more information
about Agnes.)

As always in grammar, you don’t need to clutter your mind with definitions. Just try some
of the patterns, but be sure to avoid a common error: The subject of the main part of the
sentence must be the one doing the action or in the state of being described by the intro-
ductory verb form. Check out Chapter 15 for more information on this sort of error.
Put boredom behind you by combining the two statements in each question, making one of
the statements an introductory element. Note: Several answers are possible for each exer-
cise. Your answer may differ from the one I provide in the answers section and still be cor-
rect. Check to see that you express the same ideas as the original statements and that the
action or state of being expressed by the introductory verb form relates to the subject of
the main portion of the sentence.
Q. The boss wants the memo immediately. Oliver stops cleaning his teeth and starts typing.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
A. Realizing that the boss wants the memo immediately, Oliver stops cleaning his teeth
and starts typing. This is just one of many possibilities. You may also begin with a state-
ment like Now that Oliver knows that the boss wants the memo immediately, he stops
cleaning his teeth and starts typing.
1. Jesse is considering retirement. Jesse’s mortgage holder thinks that Jesse should work at
least 100 more years.

all day.

his savings account.

8. The bank manager eventually decided to rob the bank. She drank martinis on a tropical

________________________________________________________________________________
Smoothing Out Choppy Sentences
The term subordinate doesn’t refer to the poor slob who has to make coffee and open
letters for the boss. Instead, a subordinate is the part of the sentence that, while still
containing a subject and a verb, occupies a position of lesser importance in relation
to the rest of the sentence. In the world of grammar, which is not a tourist destination,
the full name is subordinate clause. Try not to remember that fact. Do remember that
subordinate clauses may fall at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence.
Some examples, with the subordinate in italics:
The box, which Ellen was told never to open, practically screamed, “Look inside!”
After she had pried up the lid, Ellen ran screaming down the hall.
Ellen is planning to repair whatever was damaged if she ever manages to replace the lid.
(This one has two subordinates, whatever was damaged and if she . . . the lid.)
As you see, subordination is useful for tucking one idea into another. If you have a lot
of short sentences strung together, subordination can make your writing less choppy.
Take a shot at inserting ideas. Combine the ideas in these exercises into one sentence
per question, using subordinate clauses.
Q. Ellen’s boss held a press conference. The boss issued a statement about “the incident.”
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
A. Ellen’s boss held a press conference at which he issued a statement about “the inci-

Awkward but Interesting: Reversed 
Sentence Patterns
What wakes up an audience faster than a triple latte? The words in conclusion. Knowing
that a speech is almost over gives the listener an extra burst of attention. Similarly, in writ-
ing, the end of a chapter or a paragraph — and even the end of an individual sentence —
may be a high-interest spot. Yet most writers fail to take advantage of this phenomenon.
Instead, they lull the reader with the usual subject-verb-object/complement pattern. Run
your eyeballs over these two examples:
The hungry bear ran through the trees, across a clearing, and toward our SUV.
Through the trees, across a clearing, and toward our SUV ran the hungry bear.
Nothing is wrong with the first sample sentence, but isn’t the second a nice change of
pace? In the second, the hungry bear is a punch line. The sentence leads the reader through
the bear’s route before revealing the subject. Granted, you wouldn’t want to reverse all
your sentences. Doing so would simply create another pattern with the potential to bore
your reader. But stick an occasional reversed sentence in your writing, and your reader will
thank you.
Don’t reverse sentences by lapsing into passive voice. Active voice is when the subject
does the action (Mary poked Peter); passive is when the subject receives the action (Peter
was poked by Mary). Passive voice isn’t wrong. In fact, it comes in handy very occasionally
when you don’t want to say who did what (The window was broken). But passive is wordy
and awkward. If you can stay active, do so.
These sentences are in the usual order. Hit reverse gear and reword. Aim for the same
meaning expressed in a different order. To keep you awake, I tuck in a couple of passive-
voice sentences. Change them to active voice (any order) for a better, stronger expression.

Shedding and Eliminating Redundancy
Don’t you hate listening to the same thing twice? I hate listening to the same thing twice.
You probably hate listening . . . okay, I’m sure you get the point by now! Repetition is
boring. You should avoid it in your writing, regardless of the form it takes — and it does
take many forms, including doubled adjectives (calm and serene), extra phrases (six feet
tall in height), or just plain saying the same thing two different ways (in my opinion I think).

A. Extremely tense, Susannah approached the starting line. I chose extremely tense, but
you could cut those words and stay with anxious. Just don’t use both tense and anxious

Answers to Sentence Improvement Problems
a
Despite the fact that Jesse is considering retirement, his mortgage holder thinks that Jesse
should work at least 100 more years. My answer begins with a prepositional phrase. You may
also start with Although Jesse is . . . or Contrary to Jesse’s desire to . . . .
b
Because Jesse’s debt is quite large, the bank wants him to work hard. The first time I show
this sentence structure to my students, they often protest that “you can’t begin a sentence with
because.” Yes, you can, as long as you have a complete thought in the sentence.
Take care not to dangle an introduction here. (See Chapter 15 for more information on danglers.)
If you write something like Wanting Jesse to work hard, Jesse’s debt . . . , you’re saying that the
debt, not the bank, wants Jesse to work hard.
c
In addition to his desire to drink martinis on a tropical island, Jesse also wants to keep his
house. I start here with a prepositional phrase, but a clause (Even though Jesse wants to drink
martinis on a tropical island) would also be a good beginning, pairing nicely with the rest of the
sentence (Jesse also wants to keep his house).
d
Impractical in every way, the plan is especially unrealistic in letting Jesse drink martinis all
day. The introduction here is just another way to describe plan, the subject of the main part of
the sentence.
e
Speaking to Jesse in a loud voice, the bank manager points out that he has $.02 in his sav-
ings account. Here the bank manager is still speaking, but that thought is expressed by an
introductory verb form now, not by a separate sentence.
f
Angering easily, the bank manager admits that Jesse brings out the worst in her. I added
admits so that the bank manager is the subject of the sentence. A dangler (an error I explain in
Chapter 15) would be created by leaving Jesse as the subject and beginning with angering or a
similar expression. In such a sentence, Jesse would be the one angering easily — not the mean-
ing you want to convey. Another possible correction: Bringing out the worst in the bank man-
ager, Jesse angered her easily.
g
Even though he is an honest man, Jesse considered robbing the bank. The first part of the
sentence is a clause because it has a subject and a verb, but it depends upon the statement in
the second part of the sentence to complete the thought.
h
With martinis on a tropical island in her future, the bank manager eventually decided to
rob the bank. Here a nice set of prepositional phrases packs an opening punch.
i
Joseph Shmo, who is a prize-winning reporter, asked the boss a number of questions. You
can also drop the who is, leaving a prize-winning reporter to do the job. (The shortened form is
called an appositive, but you don’t need to know that. You don’t need to know what was in the
box either.)
j
The boss asked Joe to sit down and be quiet, but Joe, who was still looking for information,
refused. Here who tacks the extra information about Joe firmly to the rest of the sentence.
k
The CIA, which was interested in the case, sent several agents who were supposed to investi-
gate. The pronoun which stands in for the CIA and introduces extra information about that
secretive agency.
l
Ellen didn’t want to talk to the agents because her boss had told her that her job was in jeop-
ardy. The new, combined sentence has a cause-and-effect structure introduced by the word
because.
251
Chapter 19: Spicing Up and Trimming Down Your Sentences

m
When she slipped out of the office, Ellen bought a bus ticket. The word when ties the informa-
tion about slipping out to the reason Ellen slipped out.
n
If the CIA tracks her down, they will deal with her harshly. Ignoring the CIA isn’t nice. 
Writing choppy sentences isn’t nice either! If expresses a possibility, as does the verb may in
the original.
o
While Ellen is away, the boss is trying to manage the news media. A time expression works
nicely here, tying Ellen’s absence to the boss’s press conference.
p
Ellen has offered her story to an independent film company that is tentatively interested.
When you use that to introduce an idea, a comma is seldom necessary.
q
The box has been placed in the nation’s most secure prison, which is located in a desert.
When you use which to introduce an idea, a comma usually separates the which statement from
the rest of the sentence. (Check out Chapter 5 for more information on comma use.)
r
Whoever knows what was in the box is in danger. Sounds like the plot of a new TV series,
doesn’t it? When you’re tucking ideas into your sentences, don’t forget whatever and 
whoever — very useful little words!
s
Sprinting from the kitchen, sliding through the living room, and making a bee-line for the
lawn was Duke, our favorite Pug. By placing the subject, Duke, near the end, you gain drama.
t
In Duke’s way was the locked front door. Not a big change, but placing the locked front door 
at the end is a way to emphasize the tragedy of the barrier that the eager dog can’t surmount.
u
Duke didn’t chew the newspaper and advertisements. The original sentence is passive, not
usually a good choice. The correction is a straightforward, active voice, subject-verb-object
order. You can also flip the standard order and place the object before the subject and verb.
v
On the front door a few tooth marks and about a hundred scratches placed Duke. The new
order is dramatic, emphasizing Duke. It may sound awkward to your ear, however. That’s the
trade-off with reverse order sentences. You gain interest but startle (and perhaps disturb) your
reader. Use this sort of sentence sparingly!
w
Unsuccessful for Duke was puppy obedience school. Leading with the description unsuccessful
is a surprising, and therefore interesting, choice.
x
On the front porch listening to Duke’s frantic efforts stood the paper deliverer. Leading with
phrases (on the front porch and listening to Duke’s frantic efforts) is unusual but effective.
y
Not a fan of dogs was he. This reverse-order sentence has a comic effect, highlighting not a fan
of dogs by placing it in an unexpected position.
A
Seven dog-bite scars had his left leg. Like question 25, this reverse-order sentence focuses on
seven dog-bite scars.
B
Not to blame for the paper deliverer’s tooth marks was Duke. Leading with a negative (not)
isn’t something you’d want to do every day, but every seven days or so (just kidding — what I
mean is on rare occasions), you can get a lot of attention with this pattern.
C
On the other hand, Duke did inflict the mail carrier’s scars. The passive voice of the original
is a real no-no. You do know, because the sentence tells you, who chomped on the mail carrier.
Passive voice is therefore unnecessary and awkward.
252
Part V: Writing with Style 

D
Susannah’s new idea for racing strategy was to cut away quickly from the crowd. You may
cut new and leave innovative, but don’t use both. Also, you may drop to cut away quickly from
the crowd and leave separate herself. If that’s your option, you may want to move quickly to the
end of the sentence, just to retain the idea of speed.
E
Susannah has a great chance of winning. Why say I believe or in my view? If you’re saying that
Susannah has a chance, the listener or reader knows that’s what you think. Winning and finish-
ing in first place are the same; choose either one.
F
The spikes that she installed on her tire rims should easily cut her opponents’ tires. More
doubles: installed and put in match, as do easily and without much effort. Choose one of each,
but not both.
G
Bethany thinks that Susannah scattered tacks over the left side of the course, where her
chief rival rides. I imagine that a hardware specialist could explain the difference between
tacks and little nails, but to the general reader, the distinction is irrelevant. Ditto for chief and
most important.
H
Susannah and Bethany have different ideas about what is fair in a motorcycle race. The
whole first part of the sentence is unnecessary. Of course differing points of view exist, and as
the sentence goes on to specify, the general statement is a waste of words. Also, if the bikers
can’t agree on what’s fair, by definition they also don’t agree on what’s unfair, so that part of 
the statement may also be cut.
I
A little tack can alter the outcome of the race in an important way. If you prefer, drop impor-
tant and keep significant. Just don’t use the two together.
J
Susannah says that in the future she will win legally or not at all. Is there a future in the past?
Or somewhere else in time? Once you say future, you don’t have to add days to come. (If you’d
rather keep days to come, go for it and drop future.)
K
Three sentences — Darla was lying on the floor in a heap, Her legs were bent under her, and She
breathed in quick pants — may be easily combined. The ideas in the first two sentences are
turned into introductory elements, with the last of the three sentences as the main idea. If you
add an introductory element with a verb form, be sure that the subject of the main section of
the sentence is the person or thing doing the action or in the state of being mentioned in the
introduction. Another possible combination: After Darla fainted, she was lying on the floor in a
heap. With her legs under her, she breathed in quick pants.
Darla fainted. Lying on the floor in a heap, her legs bent under her, 
she breathed in quick pants at a rapid rate. Henry came r Running as 
fast as he could came Henry. Nearing Darla, he gasped, “My angel.” 
His heart was beating so fast that his cardiologist would worry. Henry 
did not care. Henry cared only about Darla, the love of his life, now 
unconscious. Kneeling next to her he said, “Angel Pie, you don’t have to 
pawn your engagement ring.”

L
The revision cuts repetition; rapid and quick are the same.
M
The sentence Henry came running as fast as he could has been reversed to create an interesting
variation on the standard sentence pattern.
N
Two sentences — He neared Darla and gasped. “My angel,” he said. — have been combined. The
new version, with an introductory element (Nearing Darla), is more concise.
O
A subordinate (that his cardiologist would worry) tucks an idea from one sentence into another.
Another possibility: He neared Darla and gasped, “My angel.”
P
The original story ends with several short, choppy sentences. The revision combines all but
the last sentence.
Q
The last two sentences of the original combine with an introductory verb form, kneeling. If you
begin with kneeling, be sure that he or Henry is the subject of the main part of the sentence.
You can also revise this section in this way: “Angel Pie, you don’t have to pawn your engage-
ment ring,” he said as he knelt next to her.

here. Peer through the lens and raise your writing to the highest level.
Separating Almost-Twins: Commonly 
Confused Words
Do you know any twins who resemble each other but have completely different personali-
ties? One is a professional hang glider, perhaps, and the other a librarian. Then you under-
stand that each half of a similar-looking pair may function in a vastly different way, and woe
to the writer who sends one to do the other’s job. This section divulges the ones that trip
up most people.
Affect usually expresses action: Mallory’s tantrum did not affect her mother’s decision
to leave the candy aisle.
Effect is most often used as a noun and means “result”: One effect of Mallory’s sweet
tooth was a truly impressive dental bill.
Both affect and effect may be used in other ways, though much less frequently. Affect as a
noun means “the way someone displays emotions.” Effect as a verb means “to bring about a
change in the face of opposition.” In this chapter, though, I concentrate on the more common
usage for each.
Got it? If you think you know how you’re affected by the effect of these almost-twins, check
out the next set of commonly confused words.
Farther refers to distance: Mallory runs farther than anyone else when a candy bar is at
stake.
Further refers to just about everything but distance (intensity, degree, time, and so
forth): When Mallory thought further about the matter, she decided that artificial sweet-
ener was never a good choice.

Other pairs (or triplets) are quite different in appearance, but for some reason people
mix them up:
Like expresses similarity, but it may not be attached to a subject/verb combo: She
jumps like Mike.
As expresses similarity too, but it’s the one you want in front of a subject/verb:
She jumps as Mike does, but she gets paid less for her leaps.
Such as introduces examples: Mallory’s cupboard is stocked with sweets such as
pie filling, pudding mix, and chocolate.
The last commonly confused words often go together, but they aren’t interchangeable.
Imply is “to hint”: Mallory never actually asked for a gumdrop, but she strongly
implied that one would be welcome.
Infer is “to figure something out that has been implied”: Hearing Mallory’s “Ode
on a Gumdrop,” I inferred that the bag of candy would probably be empty after
Mallory’s visit.

Comparing Quantities without Numbers
Lost in the fog of the history of English is the reason why different words are used to
describe singulars and plurals when you’re counting or measuring:
More than, many, and fewer work for plurals: more than nineteen witnesses, many prob-
lems, fewer than fifty coffee cups. These words work well with things you can count.
Less, much, and over take you into singular territory: less interest in the sport, much
unrest, over an hour. These words are best with things you can measure but not count.
The word over is frequently misused in place of more or more than.
Amount is appropriate when the item you’re discussing is singular: the amount of
enthusiasm.
Number applies to plurals: the number of bowties.
Between is the word you want when you’re talking about two people or things:
I’m having trouble choosing between pistachio and chocolate chip.
Among is for groups of three or more: Among the twelve candidates for mayor,
Shirley stands out.
Uncover your toes (in case you need to count higher than ten) and take a stab at this
sentence. Circle the correct word in each set of parentheses.
Q. Just (between/among) you and me, do you think he needs a dye job?
A. between. You plus me equals two, and between is the word for couples. Among comes into
play for three or more, as in among the five of us.
13. The boss sent (more than/over) 300 memos describing when and how we can order paper
for the copy machine.
14. We employees, all 4,546 of us, discussed the memo (between/among) ourselves, and
despite (many/much) difference of opinion, we eventually agreed on one thing.
15. We decided that e-mail uses (fewer/less) paper and is easier to ignore.
16. The boss’s (many/much) memos scold us for the (number/amount) of paper we waste.
17. Recently, the boss’s secretary collected (more than/over) 5,000 sheets of paper from our
desks, all of them memos sent to us by the boss.
18. Surely it takes (fewer/less) energy to shelve the issue altogether.
19. (More than/over) a year ago the boss caught “shredding fever.”
20. The (number/amount) of important material he shredded is impossible to determine.
21. Personally, in a contest (between/among) him and his dog, the dog would win the award
for “Best Boss.”

The expressions can’t help but and cannot help but are double negatives. English, not
always the most logical language in the universe, is logical in this instance: The two 
negatives (not and but) cancel each other and express a positive meaning. Thus the 
original sentence means that you can stop thinking this way if you want to do so.

Verbs That Will Give You a Headache
Sit (not set) yourself down for some practice with four headache-inducing verbs.
Afterward you can lie (not lay) down for a rest.
To lie is “to rest or recline the body.” (Yes, it also means that you aren’t telling the
truth, but that definition isn’t a problem.) The past tense of lie is lay. The form of
the verb lie that combines with has, have, or had is lain.
To lay is “to place something” or “to put.” The past tense of lay is laid. For lay, the
form that combines with has, have, or had is laid.
To sit is “to bend your knees and put your bottom on some sort of surface.” The
past tense and the combo form are both sat.
To set is “to place, to put something somewhere.” The past tense and combo
forms are also set.
To tell the difference between these two pairs of verbs, think of lie and sit as actions
that a person does to himself or herself: I lie down, I sit in the chair. Lay and set, on
the other hand, are actions that a person does to something else: I lay the check on
the desk, I set the vase down on the piano.
Don’t set down your pen until you try the following questions. Circle the correct form
of the verb in the parentheses.
Q. Yesterday Alice was so tired that she (lie/lay/lied/laid, lain) down for a nap even though
her favorite soap was on television.
A. lay. The meaning in this sentence is “to rest or to recline,” so the verb you want is to lie,
and the past tense of to lie is lay.
37. In the soap, the main character (lies/lays) in bed, comatose.
38. In the world of soaps, the rule is that the doctor must (sit/set) by the bed every day with
a look of concern and love on his or her face.
39. In yesterday’s episode, the doctor (sit/sat/set) a bouquet of flowers on the nightstand.
40. When the nurse told the doctor to go home and (lie/lay) down, the doctor replied that she
would “(sit/set) down for a while.”
260
Part V: Writing with Style 

41. Last week the doctor (lay/laid) a wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier.
42. The viewers think the wreath that (lies/lays) there is a sign that the soldier is really the
doctor’s long lost lover.
43. During sweeps week, the long lost lover will show up and (sit/set) next to the doctor in
the cafeteria.
44. The final show will reveal that the long lost lover has (lain/laid) in a bed, comatose too.
45. While the doctor (sits/sets) there gobbling tuna salad, the lover will explain what hap-
pened to the evil twin and other soap mysteries.
Combining Rightfully Independent Words
A few pairs are often written — erroneously — as a single word: a lot (never alot) and
all right (never alright). A couple of other pairs have both a single- and a double-word
form, and confusing these pairs changes the meaning of your sentence:
 Already (by this time) and all ready (completely prepared)
 Everyday (ordinary) and every day (daily)
 Sometime (at an unspecified moment) and some time (a period of time)
Can you find the correct form in the following pairs? Circle your choices.
Q. Because Jennifer sneezes (alot/a lot), Abigail has (already/all ready) packed a dozen 
handkerchiefs.
A. a lot, already. The single-word form alot is never correct. In the second parentheses, the
meaning you want is “by this time,” so already is the one.
46. The sneezing will end (sometime/some time).
47. Jennifer has devoted (sometime/some time) to the study of the nose and its explosions.
48. She has discovered that most people sneeze at least once (everyday/every day).
49. Jennifer herself sneezes at least ten times a day, so she buys (alot/a lot) of tissues.
50. When Abigail arrived to take Jennifer to the airport, Jennifer was (already/all ready).
51. Jennifer carried her (everyday/every day) handkerchief, a blue cotton square.
52. Abigail packed a fresh outfit for (everyday/every day) of the trip.
53. “Come on (already/all ready)!” sighed Abigail with impatience.
54. “It will take us (sometime/some time) to get to the airport and through security,” she
added.
55. “(Alright!/All right!) I’m coming,” yelled Jennifer.

learned 12 languages, including ancient Egyptian, and spent some time 
everyday studying Egyptian grammar so that his writing would be alright. 
Demos had just set down to supper when the Grim Reaper appeared at

though he was heard to say, “I would like to lay down for a while.” 
Demos, who wrote over 50 books, will be fondly remembered.

Answers to Tricky Word Problems
a
further. In this sentence you want a word that indicates a greater degree, so further fills the bill.
b
such as. The word must introduce a list of examples, so such as is the best choice.
If you introduce examples with like, you exclude those examples. In the preceding answer, like
means that the speaker in the sentence did not provide a photo of his car, a statement from his
girlfriend, or an attendance award. Instead he provided items that were similar to those on this
list.
c
implied. The speaker in this sentence is hinting that his finances are in bad shape, and to imply
is “to hint.”
d
As. In front of a subject/verb combo, as is the only appropriate choice.
e
further. The verb go makes you think of distance (and farther is the word you want for dis-
tance), but testimony is not a road that can be measured. Instead, the judge is referring to time,
and further does the job.
f
Like. The speaker resembles a statue, and like expresses similarity. Because no verb follows,
like is better than as.
g
inferred. Picking up on subtle hints, the judge inferred that the speaker was annoyed with the
speeding ticket.
h
effect. The sentence calls for a noun meaning result. Bingo: effect wins.
i
affected. Here you’re looking for a verb that’s the same as influence. Affect is that verb.
j
such as. The tickets are presented as an example of budget-wreckers, and such as introduces
examples.
k
further. Once you’re talking about time, farther isn’t an option, because farther refers to dis-
tance.
l
affects, infer. Substitute the verb influences and the sentence makes sense. Affect is a verb
meaning “influence.” In the second part of the sentence, the date will “figure out,” or infer the
poverty.
m
more than. Memos, a plural, calls for more than.
n
among, much. Because more than two employees are talking, among is the one you want.
Between works for couples, not mobs. In the second parentheses, much is the choice because
difference is singular.
o
less. The word paper is singular, so less is appropriate.
p
many, amount. Many works for plurals, and memos is a plural word. In the second paren-
theses, the singular paper is the issue. Number works with plurals, but amount is for singular
expressions.
q
more than. When you’re talking about sheets, you’re in plural land. Use more than.
263
Chapter 20: Steering Clear of Tricky Word Traps

r
less. It may take fewer employees to shelve the issue, but it takes less energy, because energy is
singular.
s
over. One year calls for over, the term for singulars.
t
amount. The word material is singular, even though the term may refer to a ton of stuff, as in
the material in my file cabinet that I don’t want to work on. Singular takes amount.
u
between. In comparing two potential candidates for leadership awards, between is best.
v
fewer. Employees is a plural, so fewer does the job.
w
amount. Here you’re talking about barking (yes, the boss barks too), so amount is needed for
the singular term.
x
Among. If you’re looking at all the inhabitants of New York City, you’re talking about more than
two people. Hence, among.
y
Regardless of the teacher’s views on technology in the classroom, Mark sends an instant
message to his brother. Irregardless is the Loch Ness Monster of formal English; it doesn’t exist.
Substitute regardless.
A
Kevin doesn’t answer immediately, because he is in the middle of the sandbox. Another non-
existent expression is being that. Use because or as.
B
“I’ll try to answer Mark after snack,” he thinks. The expression try and says that the speaker is
going to do two things: try and answer. But the real meaning of the sentence is “try to answer.”
C
The teacher doesn’t want any distraction from the peanut butter cookies she has prepared,
so she confiscates Kevin’s PDA, which sends and receives e-mail, keeps track of Kevin’s play
dates, and handles instant messages. Double negatives are a no-no. Change doesn’t want no to
doesn’t want any.
D
Kevin should have hidden his PDA until nap time. The expression should of sounds like
should’ve, but should’ve is the contraction of should have, not should of.
E
Mark can hardly believe some of the stories Kevin tells about kindergarten. Can’t hardly is 
a double negative, which reverses the intended meaning of the sentence. Go with can hardly,
which means that Mark thinks Kevin is exaggerating.
F
Mark remembers his own days in finger-paint land, which he should’ve treasured. The con-
traction should’ve is the short form of should have.
G
Because the third grade room is near the kindergarten, Mark could have walked out of the
classroom and spoken directly to Kevin. Either could have or could’ve is fine, but stay away
from could of.
H
correct. The expression can’t help is fine when it precedes the -ing form of the verb. Just don’t
place it with but, because then you’ll have a double negative.
I
Because the day is almost over, Kevin asks the teacher to return his PDA. Delete being that
wherever you find it; send in because instead.
264
Part V: Writing with Style 

J
correct. In this sentence being is fine because it’s a verb, not a faulty substitute for because.
K
“I can hardly wait until I’m in first grade,” he remarks. Can’t hardly, a double negative, flips
your meaning. Can hardly says that waiting is a tough task.
L
lies. The character, in suitably pale makeup, rests in bed, so lies is correct.
M
sit. The doctor isn’t placing something else on the bed but instead making a lap. Go for sit.
N
set. To place something somewhere calls for the verb set.
O
lie, sit. Both of these spots call for personal body movements, not the placement of something
else. To lie and to sit deal with plopping in bed, on the couch, or in a chair.
P
laid. Because the doctor placed the wreath, the verb of choice is to lay, and the past tense of to
lay is laid.
Q
lies. This one is a bit tricky. The doctor lays the wreath, but the wreath itself just lies (rests)
there.
R
sit. The lover will pull out a chair and sit in it, not place an object somewhere.
S
lain. The lover has been stretched out in a bed, in the traditional soapy coma, so the verb must
be a form of lie. The combo form of lie is lain.
T
sits. The doctor isn’t placing something, just staying in a chair, eating. The verb is to sit, and the
form that matches doctor is sits.
U
sometime. The sentence refers to a particular moment (knowing Jennifer, about an hour after
the first achoo). Sometime means “at an unspecified time.”
V
some time. You want to say “a period of time,” which, handily enough, is the meaning of 
some time.
W
every day. Here you’re going for “daily,” so the two-word form does the job.
X
a lot. Never, never, never one word! Always two! No matter what you see printed on signs,
awnings, and papers.
Y
all ready. She had her briefcase, suitcase, computer case, and every other case prepared.
Hence, all ready.
z
everyday. Her ordinary handkerchief (thus her everyday handkerchief) isn’t as fancy as the 
silk number she carries when she’s dressed up.
Z
every day. The meaning implied here is “every single day.”
1
already. Abigail means “by this time!”
2
some time. Because Jennifer never remembers to remove all her piercing jewelry, it does
indeed take a period of time (some time) to go through the metal detector.
3
All right! I know, I know. You just opened a magazine and saw a headline with the “word” alright
in it. Wrong. Wrong. Always wrong! It’s two words.
265
Chapter 20: Steering Clear of Tricky Word Traps

4
Farther refers to distance; further is for time, intensity, or duration.
5
Effected can be a verb, but as such it means “to be the sole agent of change.” In this sentence
“influenced” is the more likely meaning, so affected is the one you want.
6
A lot is always written as two words.
7
All ready as two words means “completely prepared,” but in this sentence you want “by this
time,” which is the definition of already.
8
Everyday as one word means “ordinary.” As two words, it means “daily,” the one you want here.
9
All right is always two words, never one.
0
Sat is the past tense of sit, which is the verb you want for plopping your body in a chair. Set is
to place something else somewhere else.
!
Irregardless doesn’t exist, but regardless expresses the same idea.
@
Lie is to rest or recline; lay (in the present tense) is to put something down somewhere. Demos
wants to rest, so lie is appropriate.

Fifty books is plural, so more than comes into play. Over is for singular terms.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he renowned Dummies Part of Tens gives you a list of
“overcorrections,” mistakes people make when they’re
trying to speak or write with extreme formality and not
quite managing to follow the rules of grammar. This part
also shows you the worst, avoid-at-all-cost, common
errors that can sink your writing faster than a torpedo
from a nuclear sub. No exercises here — just the best tips
for improving your English. Read on.

Chapter 21
Ten Overcorrections
In This Chapter
 Avoiding overly formal or incorrect English
 Putting a stop to unnecessary changes
E
nglish teachers recognize a certain tone of voice that comes into play the minute
people learn that they’re talking to a grammarian. All of a sudden the eyes glaze over,
the chin lifts, and the grammar/style portion of the brain goes into overdrive. Who becomes
whom for no reason at all. Verb tenses tangle up, and had is suddenly as common as shoul-
der pads at an ’80s party. Sadly, what I call “overcorrection” is as bad an error as whatever
mistake it’s designed to avoid. If you want to identify these grammar and style potholes so
that you can steer around them, read on.
Substituting “Whom” for “Who”
True, some uneducated people never utter the word whom, even when it’s needed in a sen-
tence. But throwing whom into every situation isn’t a good idea either. Sentences requiring
whom are actually quite rare. In fact, you need whom only when the sentence calls for an
object of some sort. (Check out Chapter 10 for more information on who and whom.)
Objects receive the action of the verb, as in Whom did you call? In this sentence, whom
receives the action of the verb did call. (You, in case you were wondering, is the subject.)
The problem with whom is that when it does show up, it’s often in a sentence containing
other thoughts, so you have to sort out the various threads. One common error: Whom 
shall I say is calling? Sounds nice, right? But it’s wrong. Untangling shows you why: I shall
say whom is calling. Whom is calling? Nope. Who is calling.
Inserting Unnecessary “Had’s”
As a helping verb, had is very good (hangs out in all the best clubs, does community service
without a court order, and so on). But it shouldn’t be overused. Had places an action in the
past before another action in the past, as in this sentence: Archie had already shaved when
the aerosol can exploded. On a timeline, the shaving precedes the exploding, and both pre-
cede the present moment. Bingo. The shaving part of the sentence gets the had. The over-
correction comes when people sprinkle had’s all over, without rhyme or reason: Archie had
already shaved when the aerosol can had exploded.

Throwing in “Have” at Random
Another helping verb, have, shows up where it has no business, I suspect because it makes
the sentence sound more complicated and therefore somehow more “advanced.” Like last
year’s style at a fashionable club, an unnecessary have stands out, but not in a good way.
The have error I hear the most is Nice to have met you. Oh really? The have places the
meeting in the past, before another, present action. So nice to have met you implies some
sort of deadline, as in nice to have met you before our wedding or nice to have met you
before it was time for me to clip your toenails. The better expression is nice to meet you
(now, in the present, as we talk).
Sending “I” to Do a “Me” Job
Me sounds childlike, doesn’t it? It conjures up memories of “Me Tarzan!” and similar state-
ments. But I isn’t the personal pronoun for every sentence. I is a subject pronoun, so it
belongs in a subject spot — or after a linking verb — and nowhere else. An error that pops
up frequently is I as the object of a preposition: between you and I or except you and I.
Penalty box! The correct phrases are between you and me and except you and me.
Speaking or Writing Passively
The government, in my humble opinion, is to blame for this particular overcorrection.
Official forms tend to throw passive verbs all over the place, perhaps because passive voice
allows the writer to omit the subject — the doer, and therefore the one responsible — for the
action. How much safer it must feel to write the taxes were tripled yesterday rather than I
tripled your taxes yesterday; now please vote for me. But passive voice comes across as stilted.
Unless you need it (perhaps because you truly don’t know who did the action or because the
subject isn’t the point of the sentence), opt for active voice.
Making Sentence Structure Too Complicated
Hey, I can handle complications. I live in New York, where buying an apartment involves a
two- or three-inch pile of official forms, each of which must be signed in triplicate. But com-
plicated sentences (which abound in the pile of forms I just mentioned) don’t make your
writing look more mature. They just make your writing awkward. Stay away from sentences
like It was this treaty that ended the war and substitute This treaty ended the war. Run from
That which he discovered yesterday is the invention which will make his fortune and toward
The invention he discovered yesterday will make his fortune.
Letting Descriptions Dangle
Description is good, especially when you’re agreeing to a blind date with someone you’ve
never met. (Think of the sentence Howie is pleasantly plump, in which pleasantly plump tells
you something important about Howie.) Descriptions containing verb forms are good too,
because they give you even more information: Howie, howling at the moon as he does every
270
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

evening, is happy to double date. The description howling at the moon as he does every
evening is certainly an eye-opener, giving you a lot of information about Howie. Descriptions
in the beginning of a sentence are especially good, because they vary the usual, boring sen-
tence pattern: Running with his friend Wolfie, Howie often stays out all night. The description
running with his friend Wolfie tells you something about Howie that you probably should
know.
But — and this is a big but — don’t overuse the introductory description, or you’ll simply
create a new, but immediately boring, sentence pattern. Also, be sure that the introductory
description applies to the subject — the first person mentioned in the sentence. If not, you
have a dangler, a truly big no-no.
Becoming Allergic to “They” and “Their”
For some writers, the pronouns they and their seem to be radioactive. Because many writ-
ers make the mistake of pairing the plural their with something singular (say, a person or
everybody), overcorrectors do the opposite. Even when a plural is justified, these writers
send in he or she and similar phrases. Bad idea! Plurals (the guys, three grapefruits, both, 
several, a few, and so on) match with other plurals (they and their). So don’t write The kids
blew off his or her homework and blamed the dog. Instead, keep the plurals together: The
kids blew off their homework and blamed the dog.
Being Semi-Attached to Semicolons
Semicolons (the dot on top of the comma) link two complete sentences. They also separate
items in a list, when at least one of the listed items contains a comma already. But that’s it
for the semicolon. It isn’t a fancy comma or a weak colon. It’s a semicolon and proud to be
one. (National Semicolon Day is next week.) Why am I talking about semicolons? Because
too many people throw them around like dog treats at a kennel. Don’t; throw them around.
Oops. I mean Don’t throw them around.
Not Knowing When Enough Is Enough
I’m a writing teacher, and as much as anyone else in the field, I’m guilty of asking for more,
more, and did I mention I want to see more detail? So when some poor kid hands me a
paper about an apple, I’m there with my red pen (teachers’ revenge color), writing What
color is the apple? How many seeds does it have? In the real world, however, I’m not particu-
larly interested in reading 15 sentences about an apple when all I want to know is who threw
it at my head when I was returning graded essays. The cure for underexplaining isn’t over-
explaining. The best path is to provide interesting and relevant details and nothing more.
And if your readers wander around wondering how many seeds were in that apple, that’s
their problem.

Ten Errors to Avoid at All Cost
In This Chapter
 Mistakes that ruin your writing
 Relying too heavily on computers
W
hat did you forget? Your lunch? A parachute? I ask these questions to point out that
some mistakes are worse than others. If the plane is going down, I personally am
willing to forgo the peanut butter and jelly, but not that handy little life-saving device.
Your writing can crash also, especially if you err in a few specific ways. Ten ways, actually,
which I explain here. Everyone makes mistakes, but this chapter shows you how to avoid
the big ones.
Writing Incomplete Sentences
Unless, of course, you want to make a style point. I pause to acknowledge that the preceding
sentence is incomplete. That’s my attempt at irony and also my way of pointing out that
sometimes breaking the rules is a good thing. In a forest of complete sentences, an occa-
sional incomplete statement calls attention to an important point. However, a forest of
incomplete sentences is not a style; it’s just poor English and calls into question whether
you know how to fashion a complete sentence. That’s a bad impression to give your reader.
Be sure that each of your sentences has a subject-verb pair, an endmark, and a complete
thought. (For more information on complete sentences, take a look at Chapter 4.)
Letting Sentences Run On and On
A run-on sentence is actually two or more sentences stuck together without any legal 
“glue” — a word such as and or a semicolon. The worst form of run-on is what grammarians
call a comma splice, in which a comma attempts (and fails) to attach one complete sentence
to another. Be especially careful with words that resemble legal joiners (consequently, how-
ever, therefore, nevertheless, and so forth). Use them for the meaning, but not for glue.
(Chapter 4 explains run-ons in greater detail.)
Forgetting to Capitalize “I”
Nothing screams louder than a sentence like Do you realize that i am yours forever? I’m not
even going to discuss i M yours 4ever. If you write this way, fine. I wish you a happy life.
Ditto if you put a little circle on top of the i instead of a dot. You and I will have to agree to
go our separate ways. But even if you don’t go that far, you risk alienating the reader by
breaking so basic a rule. The personal pronoun I is always capped. Period.

Being Stingy with Quotation Marks
Whether you’re writing for school, work, or personal reasons, honesty requires you to
credit your sources. Lifting someone else’s words, dropping them into your own writing,
and omitting the quotation marks is as dishonest as passing the teller a note demanding 
all the money. In school such practices earn “F” grades; in work or public life, you may be
sued. The solution is simple. If it’s not yours, credit the source, as I have in this example, in
which I cite a nonexistent author: As Martin Sherman writes, “Plagiarism is a fatal wound to
the body of knowledge.”
Using Pronouns Incorrectly
Pronouns — noun substitutes such as he, they, all, other, neither, and the like — are gov-
erned by more rules than the citizens of a fanatical tyrant. Even if you don’t know every
fine point, you should never neglect the basics: Pronouns should replace one and only one
noun, and that noun should be clearly identifiable. Don’t use an object pronoun in a subject-
pronoun spot. Singular pronouns should replace singular nouns, and plurals match with
plurals. (Check out Chapters 3 and 10 for details on these issues.)
Placing New Words in the Wrong Context
New words seep into your vocabulary gradually. First, they begin to look familiar when
they show up in something you’re reading. Later, you recognize them as old friends. Later
still, you feel comfortable using them in your own sentences. Don’t skip any of these stages!
Every teacher, including me, has received papers from someone who memorized the “100
words most likely to show up on standardized tests” and who is determined to get as much
mileage out of them as possible. The problem is that the nuances of a word’s meaning are
hard to grasp from a list or a couple of encounters. Let me assure you that premature use
of vocabulary can be really embarrassing. You may find yourself, as one of my students did,
writing about “New York City’s government suppository of documents.” (Hint: A suppository
is a way of getting medicine into the body without a needle or a spoon. Look it up.)
Letting Slang Seep into Your Speech
It ain’t that slang is a total bomb. In fact, slang can be bad — the real bee’s knees. But if you
don’t have the 411, you may miss the boat.
That paragraph contains a mixture of slang from several different eras. You may have rec-
ognized one of the slang expressions and missed another. Therein lies the problem. Slang
changes fast, so fast that no one can possibly keep up. If your reader understands that bad
in the sentence above is slang for “good,” fine. But the reader who grasps that concept may
not realize that bee’s knees is a term for the latest, best fashion. By the way, 411 means
“information.” Ain’t is a corruption of “isn’t,” and total bomb conveys “failure.” Bottom line:
A writer who uses slang risks confusion. Also, slang sounds informal; if you want to impress
a boss or a teacher, it’s not the best vocabulary to employ.
274
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Forgetting to Proofread
Even if you finished the paper or project only ten minutes before you have to cram it into
the mailbox, take the time to proofread your work. Yo maye ffind tat som latters are nut
where they sould be, not to mentione. punctuation,
Relying on Computer Checks 
for Grammar and Spelling
You can’t cash them in, but computer checks are popular anyway, and you should remem-
ber to glance at them as you write. (I’m referring to the red and green lines that show up on
the screen to alert you to a possible mistake.) I have to admit that sometimes they actually
help, but they’re not 100 percent accurate. First of all, plenty of eras slip through. (See what
I mean? That last sentence should read plenty of errors.) Secondly, the computer often iden-
tifies a mistake when the sentence is actually correct. I get little wavy lines lots of times,
and as you have figured out by now, I’m prefect. Er . . . perfect.
Repeating Yourself
In conclusion, at the end of this chapter, I would like to state and declare that saying the
same thing more than once repetitively is a real drag, an annoyance, and a pain. Don’t — do
not — repeat, because repetition isn’t a fun or enjoyable way to pass the time. Repetition
will send your reader away fast and quickly, not to mention rapidly. Shall I reiterate the
point? Once is enough.

ow sharp are your eyes? This appendix is the grammatical equivalent of an
optometrist’s chart. If you can see it with 20/20 vision, you’ll spot 30 mistakes in each
of the four exercises. Of course, after you spot the errors, your mission is to correct them.
The errors may involve faulty structure or word choice, punctuation, capitalization, and
anything else the English Grammar Workbook For Dummies covers.
Exercise One
Sneak a peek at the college catalogue (from a university that exists only in my mind) in
Figure A-1. This course description has many faults — 30, by my count. Your count may
differ slightly depending on how you group your answers. Don’t worry about numbers —
your mission is to search and destroy the mistakes.
6901 World Domination (3 credits): Professor Peck, Mr. Lapham, Ms. Austin. One two-hour 
lecture period per week is required. Three periods of fieldwork per week is also required.
This course on world domination and dictatorship involve both lecture and that they put into 
practice what students will learn. A student will report to their faculty advisors once a month. 
Everyone must keep a journal of revolutions started, governments overthrown, and peasants’ 
oppressed. Readings include Karl and Groucho Marx’s masterful essay, “Laughing All The 
Way to The Throne”, and Chairman Mayo’s autobiography, Hold the Bacon. This is sure to 
interest students who’s career plans are to be an emperor; tsar; dictator; or reality-show 
winner. By the time the course concludes, students have gathered all necessary information 
about what it takes to rule the world. We will be discussing topics like propaganda, media 
manipulation, and telegenic coronation clothes (including crown-jewel selection). Working in 
the field, spy networks will be set up, this will count as a quarter of the grade. The students’s 
task is to outmaneuver everyone in the course by becoming the first to conquer a hostile 
country that is required for graduation. Exams also emphasizes real practical skills, and 
theoretical ideas. Students only write two papers.
Admission to this course and it’s sequel (Universal Domination) are by permission of the 
Department of Politically Science Irregardless of age or class rank, applicants should be as 
motivated than the average freshman and should try and visit the departmental office for an 
interview.

Mr. Chester Slonton
33 Warwickville Road
Alaistair, CA 90990
Dear Mr. Slonton:
    Thank you for sending us your novel, “The Lily Droops at Dawn.” To read over 1,000 pages 
about a love affair between plants is a very unique experience. In your talented hands, both of 
the plants becomes characters that are well-rounded and of great interest to the reader. Before 
Mr. Higgen, whom you know is our founder, commits to publishing this masterpiece, I must ask 
for some real minor changes.
    Most of the editors, including Mr. Higgen, was confused about the names. You are 
absolutely right in stating that each of the lovers are in the lily family, scientifically they have 
similar characteristics. Calling the lovers Lila and Lyle would not of been a problem if the 
characters were distinguished from one another in personality or habits or appearance. 
Unfortunately, your main characters resembles each other in petal color and height. True, one 
of the lilies is said to be smartest, but the reader doesnt know which.
    A second problem are the love scenes. You mention in your cover letter that you can make 
them more lengthier. Mr. Higgen feels, and I agree, that you write vivid; nevertheless, we think 
you could cut them alot without losing the reader’s attention. After all, once a person has read 
one flower proposal, he or she has essentially read them all.
    Finally, the ending needs work. When the lily droops, the book ended. Are you comfortable 
with a tiny change. Market research shows that books with happy endings appeal to the 
readers, whoever he or she may be. These volumes sell good. Instead of drooping, perhaps 
the lily could spread it’s petals and welcome the dawn. Or become a rose.
    Higgen Publishing would like this novel for their fall list. I hope that you are open to the 
changes I had outlined in this letter. I cannot help but mention that Higgen Publishing is 
probably the only publisher with experience in plant romance volumes I look forward to having 
talked with you about the editing process.
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Higgen

Hold the Tights: a Former Television Star Plays Shakespeare
Silver, the actor that played a talking horse on the Emmy-winning series Mr. Said is now 
starring in the Royal Theater production of “Hamlet.” The handsome blond recently agreed to 
discuss his approach to acting. It were never about talking, in Silvers’ view. As he had 
munched oats and sipped delicately from a water pail, the colt explained that he learned to talk 
at the age of one. Him talking was not fulfilling enough, only acting met his need for 
recognition.
“I started by reciting monologues for whomever would listen,” he said. Then one day I got a 
call from a Hollywood agent offering me the part of Mr. Said.” Tossing his mane in the air, 
Silver continued, “I plays that role for nine seasons. You get typecast. Nobody want to take a 
chance on your dramatic ability if they can find someone else for the role.” He added, “Sitting 
by the phone one day, it rang, and my agent told me that I had a audition.” That audition 
resulted in him getting the part. Silver is the only horse that have ever played Hamlet, as far as 
he knows.
The actor has all ready began rehearsals. His costume includes a traditionally velvet coat but 
no tights. “Between you and I,” he whispered, “the tights snag on my fur.” Director Ed 
Walketers asked Silver to consider shaving, and he also tried several types of material for the 
tights. Even Silver’s wife got involved in this key costuming decision. “No one tried harder than 
her to find tights I could wear,” Silver said. Nothing was suitable for this extremely unique 
situation.
Silver is equally as involved with the role itself. “I relate to Hamlet’s problems,” he explained. 
“Us horses often find it hard to take action and being decisive.” The role is also exhausting; 
Silver lays down for a quickly nap everyday before going onstage as Hamlet.

Don’t you hate computer manuals? The one in Figure A-4 is even worse than the usual
techno-babble because it contains 30 mistakes. Correct them!
Installing You’re New Widget Wheel
To install the widget wheel, a computer should first be turned off, then follow these simple 
steps.
Important: If you have an A4019 or a newest model, please discard this manual. You must 
have sent for manual number 218B, or, in the case of a computer that previously has a widget, 
for manual number 330B. Being that your computer is not covered in this manual, discard it. 
Faulty directions have been responsible for explosions and that software crashed.
1. Unpack the widget wheel which looks like a sharks tooth.
2. Unpack the two disk poles. Grasp the disk pole that is more circular. Lining up the teeth with 
 
the teeth on the widget. Note: Teeth should be brushed everyday with a WidgetBrush. see  
 
enclosed order form for more information.
3. After the teeth are tight clenched, a person should insert the widget disk into slot C.  
 
 
However, if the widget disk has a blue strip, in which case it should be inserted into slot D. 
 
Don’t mix up the slots as the computer will catch fire. Neither of these slots are open when 
 
the computer is standing upright. Sit the computer on its side before beginning this step.
4. Turn on the computer. If the screen is blank call the service specialist at 914-555-5039. If 
 
the screen blinks rapid from red to green (or from blue to yellow in model 2W4T), run further 
 
from the screen. This means the widget was installed improper; the computer is all together 
 
unusable.
5. You are almost ready to enjoy your new widget!! Place a hand on the mouse that is not 
 
wearing any rings, including wedding rings. Depending upon the model number, either  
 
press firmly or softly. Some widgets can work good no matter what the pressure.

Appendix: Grabbing Grammar Goofs

a
The subject is three periods, a plural, so the verb (are) must also be plural.
b
The subject course is singular, so the verb (involves) must also be singular.
c
To keep the sentence parallel, the noun lecture should be coupled with another noun, not with
a subject/verb combo.
d
The practical application is simultaneous to the learning, so future tense isn’t what you want.
Go for present (learn).
e
The paragraph refers to students (plural), so a shift in one spot to singular is inappropriate.
Also, a student should never pair with their, because singulars and plurals don’t match.
f
The original sentence includes the possessive peasants’ for no valid reason. The possessive
form should be linked to a noun, but here it precedes a verb form (oppressed).
g
In titles, articles (such as the in this title) shouldn’t be capitalized.
h
When a comma follows quoted material, the comma is placed inside the closing quotation mark.
i
In the original sentence the pronoun this is vague. Insert the clarifying expression, reading list.
j
The contraction who’s means “who is,” but the sentence calls for the possessive whose.
k
Items in a series are separated by semicolons only when one or more of the items contain a
comma. In this series, no item contains a comma, so semicolons aren’t necessary.
l
A future deadline (by the time the course concludes) calls for future perfect tense (will have 
gathered).
m
Like excludes the items listed and refers to items that are similar. In this sentence the listed
items are examples and should be preceded by such as.
n
The original sentence contains a dangler, working in the field. An introductory element contain-
ing a verb form must refer to the subject, and spy networks aren’t working in the field. Reword
the sentence so that the students are working in the field.
o
Two complete sentences may not be joined by a comma. Substitute a semicolon or make two
sentences.
p
The pronoun this is too vague all by itself. Substitute a noun (fieldwork) to clarify the meaning.
q
To create a possessive form for a plural ending in the letter s, just add an apostrophe, not an
extra s.
r
The student is in the course and so must be compared to everyone else.
s
In the original, this misplaced description seems to say that a country is required for gradua-
tion, not the task. Descriptions should be close to the word they describe.
t
The plural subject, exams, requires a plural verb, emphasize.
u
The description practical should be intensified by an adverb (really), not by an adjective (real).
v
If you unite two complete sentences with the word and, a comma precedes the and. If you unite
two of anything else (in this sentence, two nouns — skills and ideas), no comma precedes the and.
282
English Grammar Workbook For Dummies 

w
The descriptive word only should precede the word being compared — in this case, only two as
compared to three or four or whatever the professor assigns.
x
Possessive pronouns have no apostrophes.
y
Admission is singular and takes a singular verb, is.
A
The adjective Political describes the noun Science. Politically is an adverb and may describe
only verbs (speaking politically) or other descriptions (politically inexperienced).
B
A statement should end with a period, which is missing in the original.
C
Irregardless isn’t standard English. Substitute regardless.
D
As and than don’t belong in the same comparison. An as comparison is for equal items and a
than comparison for unequal items.
E
Try and implies two actions, but the sentence refers to one that should be attempted. The
proper expression is try to.

Proper names are capitalized.
G
The title of a full-length work (in this case, a novel) is italicized or underlined, not enclosed in
quotation marks.
H
Over precedes a singular word, and more than precedes a plural.
I
Unique is an absolute, so no degrees of uniqueness (very unique, a little unique, and so on) exist.
J
Both is plural and should be matched with the plural verb become.
K
The original sentence isn’t parallel because it pairs the simple description well rounded with the

L
The pronoun who is needed to act as a subject for the verb is.
M
Real is an adjective and appropriate for descriptions of people, places, things, or ideas. The
adverb really intensifies the description minor.
N

O
Each of the lovers is a singular subject and requires a singular verb, is.
P
A comma may not join two complete sentences. Use a semicolon instead.
Q
Would of doesn’t exist in standard English. The proper expression is would have, here changed
to the negative would not have.
R
The plural subject characters needs the plural verb resemble.
S
Smartest is for the extreme in groups of three or more. Because only two lilies are compared,
smarter is correct.
T
The contraction doesn’t contains an apostrophe.
U
The singular subject problem takes the singular verb is.
V
Double comparisons aren’t correct. Use lengthier or more lengthy.
W
The verb write may be described by the adverb vividly but not by the adjective vivid.
X
The expression a lot is always written as two words.
Y
The present-tense verb ends works best with the rest of the sentence, which contains the 
present-tense verb droops.
z
This sentence, a question, calls for a question mark instead of a period.
Z
The plural pronoun they refers to readers.
1
Good is an adjective, but the sentence calls for the adverb well to describe the verb sell.
2
A possessive pronoun, such as its, never includes an apostrophe.
3
The expression or become a rose is a fragment and may not stand as a separate sentence.
4
A company is singular, so the matching pronoun is its.
5
The helping verb had is used only to place one action in the past before another past action.
6
Cannot help but mention is a double negative.
7
Every sentence needs an endmark. This statement calls for a period.
8
Having talked implies a deadline, and the sentence doesn’t support such a meaning.

also tried several types of material for the tights. Even Silver’s wife got involved in this key 
costuming decision. “No one tried harder than her she to find tights I could wear,” Silver said. 
Nothing was suitable for this extremely unique situation.
Silver is equally as involved with the role itself. “I relate to Hamlet’s problems,” he explained. 
“Us We horses often find it hard to take action and being to be decisive.” The role is also 
exhausting; Silver lays lies down for a quickly quick nap everyday every day before going 
onstage as Hamlet.

The first word of a title and a subtitle should always be capitalized.

Silver identifies the horse being discussed. The original sentence has a comma at the beginning
of the long, descriptive expression (the actor who played a talking horse on the Emmy-winning
series Mr. Said) but none at the end. The second comma is necessary because the information
supplied is extra, not essential to the meaning of the sentence. It should be set off from the rest
of the sentence by a pair of commas.
!
The title of a full-length work (in this sentence, a play) should be in italics or underlined.
@
The singular it pairs with the singular verb was.
#
A singular possessive is formed by the addition of an apostrophe and the letter s.
$
The helping verb had places one past action before another past action, but in this sentence
the actions take place at the same time. Drop the had.
%
The possessive pronoun his should precede an -ing form of a verb that is being used as a noun
(in this sentence, talking).
^
Two complete sentences shouldn’t be joined by a comma. Use a semicolon instead.
&
The subject pronoun whoever is needed as the subject of the verb would listen. The preposition
for may have confused you because normally an object follows a preposition. However, in this
sentence the entire expression (whoever would listen) is the object of the preposition, not just
the pronoun.
*
A quotation mark belongs at the beginning and the end of the quotation.
(
The past tense verb matches the meaning of the sentence.
)
The pronoun nobody is singular and requires a singular verb, wants.
-
Only singular pronouns (in this sentence, he or she) can refer to the singular pronoun nobody.
_
In the original sentence, it (the phone) is sitting by the phone — illogical! Reword in some way
so that the speaker is sitting by the phone. Another possible correction: Add a subject/verb
combo to the beginning of the sentence so that it reads When I was sitting by the phone.
=
The article an precedes vowel sounds, such as the au in audition.
+
The possessive pronoun his should precede the -ing form of a verb that is being used as a noun
(in this sentence, getting).
[
Because only one horse is the meaning of the pronoun that, the verb paired with that is singular.
Has is singular, and have is plural.
{
The single word already means “before this time,” the meaning required by the sentence.
]
Begun is the combination form of to begin and here is paired with has.
}
The adjective traditional describes the noun coat.
\
Between is a preposition and thus takes an object. The pronoun me is an object.

Appendix: Grabbing Grammar Goofs

|
Two males appear in the sentence (Silver and Ed), so the pronoun he is unclear. Substitute a noun.
;
The missing word in the original is did, as in than she did. Her is inappropriate as the subject of
the implied verb did.
:
Unique is an absolute and can’t be compared, so the extremely must be deleted.
,
The comparison equally should not be followed by as.
<
We is the subject pronoun needed here. Us is for objects.
.
To keep the sentence parallel, to be should be paired with to take action. Another alternative is
to change to take action to acting.
>
To lay is “to place something else somewhere.” To lie is “to rest or to recline,” the meaning here.
/
The noun nap must be described by an adjective (quick), not an adverb (quickly).
?
The single word everyday means “ordinary.” In this sentence you need the two-word form,
which means “each day.”

In the following figure the errors from the original manual are boldfaced and crossed out,
with a possible correction following each one, as well as an occasional addition of a miss-
ing word or mark. All corrections are boldfaced and underlined. Check the corresponding
numbered explanations that follow the revised manual.
Installing You’re Your New Widget Wheel
To install the widget wheel, a computer should first be turned off first turn the computer 
off, and then follow these simple steps.
Important: If you have an A4019 or a newest newer model, please discard this manual. You 
must have sent send for manual number 218B, or, in the case of a computer that previously 
has had a widget, for manual number 330B. Being that Because your computer is not covered 
in this manual, discard it the manual. Faulty directions have been responsible for explosions 
and that software crashed software crashes.
1. Unpack the widget wheel, which looks like a shark’s tooth.
2. Unpack the two disk poles. Grasp the disk pole that is more nearly circular. Lining Line up 
 
the teeth with the teeth on the widget. Note: Teeth should be brushed everyday every day 
 
with a WidgetBrush. sSee enclosed order form for more information.
3. After the teeth are tight tightly clenched, a person should insert the widget disk into slot C. 
 
However, if the widget disk has a blue strip, in which case it should be inserted into slot D 
 
insert the widget into slot D. Don’t mix up the slots as the computer will catch fire. Neither 
 
of these slots are is open when the computer is standing upright. Sit Set the computer on its 
 
side before beginning this step.
4. Turn on the computer. If the screen is blank, call the service specialist at 914-555-5039. If the 
 
screen blinks rapid rapidly from red to green (or from blue to yellow in model 2W4T), run 
 
further farther from the screen. This Blinking means the widget was installed 
 
improper improperly; the computer is all together altogether unusable.
5. You are almost ready to enjoy your new widget!! Place a hand that is not wearing any 
 
rings, including wedding rings, on the mouse that is not wearing any rings, including 
 
wedding rings. Depending upon the model number, either press either firmly or softly. 
 
Some widgets can work good well no matter what the pressure.

`
The contraction you’re means “you are.” In this sentence you want the possessive pronoun your.
~
An introductory verb form (to install the Widget Wheel) must refer to the subject, but the sub-
ject in the original sentence is a computer. Reword the sentence so that the subject is the
person who is installing — the understood you.
ú
The adverb then is not capable of uniting two complete sentences on its own. Delete the
comma and insert and.
á
The -est comparison singles out one extreme from a group of three or more. In this sentence
you’re talking about a comparison between two things only — model A4019 and the group of
everything newer. (The group counts as one thing because the items in the group aren’t dis-
cussed as individuals.)
â
The verb send is in present tense and addresses what the installer must do now, not what the
installer must have done previously. The present perfect tense (have sent) implies a connection
with the past.
ƒ
The word previously tips you off to the fact that you’re talking about past tense, so had works
better than has.
©
The expression being that is not standard; use because instead.
˙
The pronoun it must have a clear meaning, but the original sentence provides two possible
alternatives, computer and manual. The correction clarifies the meaning of it.
è
Two terms linked by and need a similar grammatical identity in order to keep the sentence par-
allel. The original sentence joins a noun (explosions) with a clause (that software crashed). The
correction links two nouns, explosions and crashes.
º
A description beginning with which is usually set off by a comma from the word it describes.
¬
The tooth belongs to the shark, so you need the possessive shark’s.
µ
Circular is an absolute. It may be approached but not compared. The disk pole may be circular
or more nearly circular.
Ø
The original sentence is a fragment; it has no complete thought. The correction has a subject
(the understood you) and a verb (line) and a complete thought.
é
Everyday means “ordinary.” Every day means “daily.”
œ
A sentence always begins with a capital letter.
®
Tightly is an adverb, needed to describe the verb clenched.
ß
A person is a new expression in this piece, which has been addressing you either directly or by
implication. For consistency, change a person to you understood.
ê
The original is a fragment, not a complete sentence. The reworded version has a complete
thought.
ì
The pronoun neither is singular and takes the singular verb is.
ò
Sit is what the subject does by bending knees and plopping onto a chair. Set means that you’re
placing something else into some position.
290
English Grammar Workbook For Dummies 

¥
An introductory expression with a verb is usually set off by a comma from the main idea of the
sentence. Insert a comma after blank.
ó
The adverb rapidly is needed to describe the action blink.
¡
Farther is for distance, and further is for time or intensity. Here you need the distance word.
™
The pronoun this is too vague. Go for the specific term, blinking.
£
The adverb improperly is needed to describe the action installed.
¢
All together means “as one.” Altogether means “completely,” the definition that fits this 
sentence.
È
Don’t double up on endmarks. One per sentence does the job.
§
The description is in the wrong place in the original sentence. Place it after hands, the word
being described.
¶
The duo either/or should link words or expressions with the same grammatical identity. In the
original sentence, a verb-description combo is linked to a description. Move either so that two
descriptions are linked.
·
The adverb well is needed to describe the verb can work.
