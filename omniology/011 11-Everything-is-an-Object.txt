Throughout this course, we’ll encounter many data types.
•
Integers (int)
•
Booleans (bool)
•
Floats (float)
•
Strings (str)
•
Lists (list)
•
Tuples (tuple)
•
Sets (set)
•
Dictionaries (dict)
•
None (NoneType)
and many more…
We’ll also see other constructs:
•
Operators (+, -, ==, is, …)
•
Functions
•
Classes
•
Types

But the one thing in common with all these things, is that 
they are all objects (instances of classes)
•
Functions (function)
•
Classes (class)  [not just instances, but the class itself]
•
Types (type)
This means they all have a memory address!
Any object can be assigned to a variable
Any object can be passed to a function
Any object can be returned from a function
As a consequence:
including functions…
including functions…
including functions…
def my_func():
…
my_func
function
state
0x1000
id(my_func)
0x1000
my_func is the name of the function
my_func() invokes the function
