Preface
Maths for Chemists Second
Edition
This revised edition of the Maths for Chemists introductory text
provides a foundation in the key mathematical topics required for
most degree level chemistry courses. While it is aimed primarily at
students with limited backgrounds in mathematics, the text should
prove accessible and useful to all chemistry undergraduates. We have
chosen from the outset to place the mathematics in a chemical
context, a challenging approach because the context can often make
the problem appear more difficult than it actually is. However, it is
equally important to convince students of the relevance of mathe-
matics in all branches of chemistry. Our approach links mathematical
principles with the chemical context, by introducing the basic
concepts first and then demonstrates how they translate into a
chemical setting.
Historically, physical chemistry has been the target for much of the
undergraduate level mathematical support. However, in all branches
of chemistry – be they the more traditional areas of inorganic, organic
and physical, or the rapidly developing areas of biochemistry,
materials, analytical and environmental chemistry – mathematical
tools are required to build models of varying degrees of complexity, in
order to develop a language for providing insight and understanding
together with, ideally, some predictive capability.
Since the target student readership possesses a wide range of
mathematical experience, we have created a course of study in which
selected key topics are treated without going too far into the finer
mathematical details. The first two chapters focus on numbers,
algebra and functions in some detail, as these topics form an
important foundation for further mathematical developments in
calculus and for working with quantitative models in chemistry. There
then follow chapters on limits, differential calculus, differentials and
integral calculus. Later chapters go on to cover power series, complex
numbers, and the properties and applications of determinants,
matrices and vectors. A final chapter on simple statistics and error
analysis is a new addition to this second edition of the book, and
covers the key principles required for a successful appraisal and
v

treatment of experimental errors – an area increasingly neglected in
formal undergraduate teaching, but which remains a vital component
in all areas of experimental chemistry.

Numbers and Algebra
Numbers of one kind or another permeate all branches of chemistry
(and science generally), simply because any measuring device we use
to record a characteristic of a system can only yield a number as
output. For example, we might measure or determine the:
N Weight of a sample.
N Intensity or frequency of light absorption of a solution.
N Vibration frequency for the HCl molecule.
N Relative molecular mass of a carbohydrate molecule.
Or we might:
N Confirm the identity of an organic species by measuring its boiling
point.
N Measure, or deduce, the equilibrium constant of a reversible
reaction.
N Wish to count the number of isomeric hydrocarbon species with the
formula C4H10.
In some of these examples, we also need to:
N Specify units.
N Estimate the error in the measured property.
Clearly then, the manner in which we interact with the world around us
leads us quite naturally to use numbers to interpret our experiences.
In many situations, we routinely handle very large and very small
numbers, so disparate in size that it is difficult to have an intuitive feel
for order of magnitude. For example:
N The number of coulombs (the basic unit of electrical charge)
associated with a single electron is approximately 0.000 000 000 000
000 000 160 2177.
N The equilibrium constant for the electrochemical process

is of the order of 1 followed by 4343 zeros.1 In chemical terms, we have
no problem with this answer, as it indicates that the equilibrium is

totally towards the right side (which means that the aluminium elec-
trode will be completely consumed and the gold electrode untouched).
These two widely different examples, of a type commonly
experienced in chemistry, illustrate why it is so important to feel at
ease using numbers of all types and sizes. A familiarity and confidence
with numbers is of such fundamental importance in solving
quantitative chemical problems that we devote the first two chapters
of this book to underpinning these foundations. Our main objective
is to supply the necessary tools for constructing models to help in
interpreting numerical data, as well as in achieving an understanding
of the significance of such data.
Aims:
In this introductory chapter, we provide the necessary tools for
working with numbers and algebraic symbols, as a necessary
prelude to understanding functions and their properties – a key
topic of mathematics that impinges directly on all areas of
chemistry. By the end of the chapter you should be able to:
N Understand the different types of numbers and the rules for
their combination.
N Work with the scientific notation for dealing with very large
and very small numbers.
N Work with numerical and algebraic expressions.
N Simplify algebraic expressions by eliminating common
factors.
N Combine rational expressions by using a common denominator.
N Treat units as algebraic entities.
1.1 Real Numbers
1.1.1 Integers
One of the earliest skills we learn from childhood is the concept of
counting: at first we learn to deal with natural numbers (positive,
whole numbers), including zero, but we tend to ignore the concept of
negative numbers, because they are not generally used to count
objects. However, we soon run into difficulties when we have to
subtract two numbers, as this process sometimes yields a negative
result. The concept of a negative counting number applied to an
object can lead us into all sorts of trouble, although it does allow us to
Counting numbers have been in
use for a very long time, but the
recognition of zero as a numeral
originated in India over two mil-
lennia ago, and only became
widely accepted in the West with
the advent of the printed book in
the 13th century.

account for the notion of debt (you owe me 2 apples is the equivalent
of saying ‘‘I own –2 apples’’). We therefore extend natural numbers
to a wider category of number called integers, which consist of all
positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero:
. . . , {3, {2, {1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
We use integers in chemistry to specify:
N The atomic number, Z, defined as the number of protons in the
nucleus: Z is a positive integer, less than or equal to 112.
N The number of atoms of a given type (positive) in the formula of a
chemical species.
N The number of electrons (a positive integer) involved in a redox
reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell.
N The quantum numbers required in the mathematical specification
of individual atomic orbitals. These can take positive or negative
integer values or zero depending on the choice of orbital.
1.1.2 Rational Numbers
When we divide one integer by another, we sometimes obtain another
integer; for example, 6={3~{2. At other times, however, we obtain
a fraction, or rational number, of the form a=b, where the integers a
and b are known as the numerator and denominator, respectively; for
example, 2=3. The denominator, b, cannot take the value zero because
a=0 is of indeterminate value.
Rational numbers occur in chemistry:
N In defining the spin quantum number of an electron (s~1=2), and
the nuclear spin quantum number, I, of an atomic nucleus; for
example, 45Sc has I~7=2.
N In specifying the coordinates (0,0,0) and a
2 , a
2 , a

, which define the
locations of two of the nuclei that generate a body-centred unit cell
of side a.
1.1.3 Irrational Numbers
Rational numbers can always be expressed as ratios of integers,
but sometimes we encounter numbers which cannot be written
in this form. These numbers are known as irrational numbers and
include:
At the time of writing, the heaviest
(named) element to have been
isolated is the highly radioactive
element copernicium (Z 5 112).
In June 2011, elements 114 and
116 officially joined the periodic
table. Element 116 was made
by bombarding targets made
of the radioactive element curium
(Z 5 96) with calcium nuclei
(Z 5 20). The nuclei of element
116 lasted only a few millise-
conds before decaying into ele-
ment 114, which itself lasted less
than half a second before decay-
ing to copernicium. The heaviest
naturally occurring element is
uranium, Z 5 92.

, which are obtained from the solution of
a quadratic or higher order equation.
N Transcendental numbers, which, in contrast to surds, do not derive
from the solution to algebraic equations. Examples include p,
which we know as the ratio of the circumference to diameter of a
circle, and e, which is the base of natural logarithms.
1.1.4 Decimal Numbers
Decimal numbers occur in:
N Measuring chemical properties, and interpreting chemical data.
N Defining relative atomic masses.
N Specifying the values of fundamental constants.
Decimal numbers consist of two parts separated by a decimal point:
N Digits to the left of the decimal point give the integral part of the
number in units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.
N A series of digits to the right of the decimal point specify the
fractional (or decimal) part of the number (tenths, hundredths,
thousandths, etc.).
We can now more easily discuss the distinction between rational and
irrational numbers by considering how they are represented using
decimal numbers.
Rational numbers, expressed in decimal form, may have either of
the following representations:
N A finite number of digits after the decimal point: for example, 3=8
becomes 0.375.
N A never-ending number of digits after the decimal point, but with a
repeating pattern: for example, 70=33 becomes 2.121 212…, with
an infinite repeat pattern of ‘12’.
Irrational numbers, expressed in decimal form have a never-ending
number of decimal places in which there is no repeat pattern: for
example, p is expressed as 3.141 592 653… and e as 2.718 281 82… .
As irrational numbers like p and e cannot be represented exactly by a
finite number of digits, there will always be an error associated with
their decimal representation, no matter how many decimal places we
include. For example, the important irrational number e, which is the
base for natural logarithms (not to be confused with the electron
charge), appears widely in chemistry. This number is defined by the
infinite sum of terms:

p
is obtained as a solution of
the equation x22250; likewise,
ﬃﬃﬃ

Decimal numbers are so-called
because they use base 10 for
counting.

where n! is the factorial (pronounced ‘n factorial’) of the number n,
defined as n!516263646…6n: for example, 4!51626364. The
form of eqn (1.1) indicates that the value for e keeps getting larger
(but by increasingly smaller amounts), as we include progressively
more and more terms in the sum; a feature clearly seen in Table 1.1, in
which the value for e has been truncated to 18 decimal places.
Although the value of e has converged to 18 decimal places, it is still
not exact; the addition of more terms causes the calculated value to
change beyond the 18th decimal place. Likewise, attempts to calculate p
are all based on the use of formulae with an infinite number of terms:

1.1.4.1 Working with Decimal Numbers
As we have seen above, numbers in decimal form may have a finite or
infinite number of digits after the decimal point: thus, for example, we
say that the number 1.4623 has 4 decimal places. However, since the
decimal representations of irrational numbers, such as p or the surd
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
, all have an infinite number of digits, it is necessary, when working
with such decimal numbers, to reduce the number of digits to those
that are significant (often indicated by the shorthand ‘sig. fig.’). In
specifying the number of significant figures of a number displayed in
decimal form, all zeros to the left of the first non-zero digit are taken
as not significant and are therefore ignored. Thus, for example, both
0.1456 and 0.000 097 44 have 4 significant figures.
There are basically two approaches for reducing the number of
digits to those deemed significant:
N Truncation of the decimal part of the number to an appropriate
number of decimal places or significant digits: for example, we
could truncate p, 3.141 592 653… to 7 significant figures (6 decimal
places), by dropping all digits after the 2, to yield 3.141 592. For
future reference, we refer to the sequence of digits removed as the
‘tail’ which, in this example, is 653…
N Rounding up or rounding down the decimal part of a number to a
given number of decimal places is achieved by some generally
accepted rules. The number is first truncated to the required
number of decimal places in the manner described above; attention
is then focused on the tail (see above).
(i)
If the leading digit of the tail is greater than 5, then the last
digit of the truncated decimal number is increased by unity
(rounded up), e.g. rounding p to 6 decimal places (d.p.) yields
3.141 593;
(ii) If the leading digit of the tail is less than 5, then the last digit of
the truncated decimal number is left unchanged (the number is
rounded down); e.g. rounding p to 5 d.p. yields 3.141 59;
(iii) If the leading digit of the tail is 5, then:
(a) If this is the only digit, or there are also trailing zeros, e.g.
3.7500, then the last digit of the truncated decimal number
is rounded up if it is odd or down if it is even. Thus 3.75 is
rounded up to 3.8 because the last digit of the truncated
number is 7 and therefore odd, but 3.45 is rounded down
to 3.4 because the last digit of the truncated number is 4
and therefore even. This somewhat complicated rule
ensures that there is no bias in rounding up or down in
cases where the leading digit of the tail is 5;
6
Maths for Chemists

(b) If any other non-zero digits appear in the tail, then the last
digit of the truncated decimal number is rounded up, e.g.
3.751 is rounded up to 3.8.
Worked Problem 1.1
Q. Compare the results obtained by sequentially rounding 7.455
to an integer with the result obtained using a single act of
rounding.
A. On applying the rules for rounding, the numbers produced in
sequence are 7.46, 7.5, 8. Rounding directly from 7.455, we
obtain 7.
Problem 1.1
Give the values of (a) 2.554 455, (b) 1.723 205 08, (c) p and (d) e
to:
(i)
5, 4 and 3 decimal places, by a single act of rounding in
each case,
(ii) 3 significant figures,
using p 5 3.141 592 653 and e 5 2.718 281 828.
1.1.4.2 Observations on Rounding
Worked Problem 1.1 illustrates that different answers may be
produced if the rules are not applied in the accepted way. In
particular, sequential rounding is not acceptable, as potential errors
may be introduced because more than one rounding is carried out. In
general, it is accepted practice to present the result of a chemical
calculation by rounding the result to the number of significant figures
that are known to be reliable (zeros to the left of the first non-zero
digit are not included). Thus, although p is given as 3.142 to 4
significant figures (3 decimal places), p/1000 is given to 4 significant
figures (and 6 decimal places) as 0.003142.
1.1.4.3 Rounding Errors
It should always be born in mind that, in rounding a number up or
down, we are introducing an error: the number thus represented is
Numbers and Algebra
7

merely an approximation of the actual number. The conventions
discussed above for truncating and rounding a number imply that a
number obtained by rounding actually represents a range of numbers
spanned by the implied error bound. Thus, p expressed to 4 decimal
places, 3.1416, represents all numbers between 3.14155 and 3.14165, a
feature that we can indicate by writing this rounded form of p as
3.14160 ¡ 0.00005. Whenever we use rounded numbers, it is prudent
to aim to minimise the rounding error by expressing the number to a
sufficient number of decimal places. However, we must also be aware
that if we subsequently combine our number with other rounded
numbers through addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
the errors associated with each number also combine, propagate and,
generally, grow in size through the calculation.
Problem 1.2
(a) Specify whether each of the following numbers are rational
or irrational and, where appropriate, give their values to 4
significant figures. You should assume that any repeat
pattern will manifest itself within the given number of
decimal places:
ið Þ 1:378 423 7842;
ii
ð Þ 1:378 423 7842 . . . ;
iii
ð
Þ 1
70 ;
(iv) p
4 ;
v
ð Þ 0:005068;
vi
ð Þ e
10 :
Note: The number e expressed to 9 decimal places, 2.718 281
828, appears to have a repeating pattern, which might wrongly
suggest it is a rational number; however, if we extend it to a
further 2 decimal places, 2.718 281 828 46, we see that there is
no repeating pattern and the number is irrational.
(b) In a titration experiment, the volume delivered by a burette
is recorded as 23.3 cm3. Give the number of significant
figures; the number of decimal places; and estimates for the
maximum and minimum titres.
1.1.5 Combining Numbers
Numbers may be combined using the arithmetic operations of addition
(+), subtraction (2), multiplication (6) and division (/ or 4). The
8
Maths for Chemists

type of number (integer, rational or irrational) is not necessarily
maintained under combination; thus, for example, addition of the
fractions J and L yields an integer, but division of 3 by 4 (both
integers) yields the rational number (fraction) L. When a number (for
example, 8) is multiplied by a fraction (for example, L), we say in
words that we want the number which is three quarters of 8, which, in
this case, is 6.
For addition and multiplication the order of operation is
unimportant, regardless of how many numbers are being combined.
Thus,
2 z 3 ~ 3 z 2
and
2 | 3 ~ 3 | 2
and we say both addition and multiplication are commutative.
However, for subtraction and division, the order of operation is
important, and we say that both are non-commutative:
2 { 3 = 3 { 2
and
2
3 = 3
2 :
One consequence of combining operations in an arithmetic
expression is that ambiguity may arise in expressing the outcome.
In such cases, it is imperative to include brackets (in the generic
sense), where appropriate, to indicate which arithmetic operations
should be evaluated first. The order in which arithmetic operations
may be combined is described, by convention, by the BODMAS rules
of precedence. These state that the order of preference is as follows:
Brackets
Of (multiplication by a fraction)
Division
Multiplication
Addition/Subtraction
For example:
N If we wish to evaluate 2 6 3 + 5, the result depends upon whether
we perform the addition prior to multiplication or vice versa. The
BODMAS rules tell us that multiplication takes precedence over
Numbers and Algebra
9

addition and so the result should be 6 + 5 5 11 and not 2 6 8 5 16.
Using parentheses ( ) in this case removes any ambiguity, as we
would then write the expression as (2 6 3) + 5.
N If we wish to divide the sum of 15 and 21 by 3, then the expression
15 + 21 / 3 yields the unintended result 15 + 7 5 22, instead of 12,
as division takes precedence over addition. Thus, in order to
obtain the intended result, we introduce parentheses to ensure that
summation of 15 and 21 takes place before division:
15 z 21
ð
Þ = 3 ~ 36 = 3 ~ 12:
Alternatively, this ambiguity is avoided by expressing the quotient in
the form:
15z12
3
However, as the solidus sign, /, for division is in widespread use, it is
important to be aware of possible ambiguity.
1.1.5.1 Powers or Indices
When a number is repeatedly multiplied by itself, in an arithmetic
expression, such as 3 6 3 6 3, or 3
2 | 3
2 | 3
2 | 3
2, the power or index
notation (also often called the exponent) is used to write such products
in the forms 33 and
3
2
 4
, respectively. Both numbers are in the
general form an, where n is the index. If the index, n, is a positive
integer, we define the number an as a raised to the nth power.
We can define a number of laws for combining numbers written in
this form simply by inspecting expressions such as those given above:
For example, we can rewrite the expression:
3
2 | 3
2 | 3
2 | 3
2 ~ 3

 3 3

 4
and we see that the result is obtained simply by adding the indices of the
numbers being combined. This rule is expressed in a general form as:
10
Maths for Chemists

anam ~ anzm
ð1:2Þ
For rational numbers, of the form a
b, raised to a power n, we can
rewrite the number as a product of the numerator with a positive
index and the denominator with a negative index:
a

which, in the case of the above example, yields:

1.1.5.2 Rational Powers
Numbers raised to powers 1
2, 1
3, 1
4,…., 1
n define the square root, cube
root, fourth root,…, nth root, respectively. Numbers raised to the
power m/n are interpreted either as the mth power of the nth root or as
the nth root of the mth power: for example, 3m/n 5 (31/n)m 5 (3m)1/n.
Numbers raised to a rational power may either simplify to an integer,
for example (27)1/3 5 3, or may yield an irrational number; for
example (27)1/2 5 3 6 31/2 5 33/2.

Consider the simplification of the expression (326103)2:

2 ~ 32 |103 | 32 | 103 ~ 34 |106:

Note that, when multiplying symbols representing numbers, the
multiplication sign (6) may be dropped. For example, in the

kinds of expression, n and m can be integer or rational. Finally, if the

1.1.6 Scientific Notation
As has been noted earlier, many numbers occurring in chemical
calculations are either extremely small or extremely large. Clearly, it
becomes increasingly inconvenient to express such numbers using
decimal notation as the order of magnitude becomes increasingly
large or small. For example, as seen in the introduction to this
chapter, the charge on an electron (in coulombs), expressed as a
decimal number, is given by:
0:000 000 000 000 000 000 160 2177
To get around this problem we can use scientific notation to write such
numbers as a signed decimal number, usually with magnitude greater
than or equal to 1 and less than 10, multiplied by an appropriate
power of 10. Thus, we write the fundamental unit of charge to 9
significant figures as:
1:602 177 33|10{19 C:
Likewise, for very large numbers, such as the speed of light, we
write c 5 299 792 458 ms21 which, in scientific notation, becomes
2.997 924 58 6 108 ms21 (9 sig. fig.). Often we use c 5 36108 ms21,
using only 1 sig. fig., if we are carrying out a rough calculation.
The conventional representation
of numbers using scientific nota-
tion is not always followed. For
example, we might represent a
bond length as 0.1461029 m
rather than 1.4610210 m, if we
were referencing it to another
measurement of length given in
integer unit multiples of 1029 m.
Numbers and Algebra
13

Sometimes, an alternative notation is used for expressing a number
in scientific form: instead of specifying a power of 10 explicitly, it is
common practice (particularly in computer programming) to give
expressions for the speed of light and the fundamental unit of charge
as 2.998e8 ms21 and 1.6e–19 C, respectively. In this notation,
the number after the e is the power of 10 multiplying the decimal
number prefix.
1.1.6.1 Combining Numbers Given in Scientific Form
Consider the two numbers 4.261028 and 3.561026; their product
and quotient are given respectively by:
4:2 |10{8 | 3:5 |10{6 ~ 14:7 |10{14 ~ 1:47 | 10{13
and
4:2|10{8
3:5|10{6 ~1:2|10{2:
However, in order to calculate the sum of the two numbers (by hand!),
it may be necessary to adjust one of the powers of ten to ensure
equality of powers of 10 in the two numbers. Thus, for example:
4:2 |10{8 z 3:5 | 10{6 ~ 0:042 |10{6 z 3:5 | 10{6
~ 3:542 |10{6
1.1.6.2 Names and Abbreviations for Powers of Ten
As we have seen in some of the examples described above, an added
complication in performing chemical calculations often involves the
presence of units. More often than not, these numbers may be
expressed in scientific form and so, in order to rationalise and simplify
their specification, it is conventional to use the names and
abbreviations given in Table 1.2, adjusting the decimal number given
as prefix as appropriate.

Thus, for example:
N The charge on the electron is given as 0.16 aC, to 2 significant
figures.
N The binding energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom is given by
2.179 6 10218 J, which is specified as 2.179 aJ.
N the bond vibration frequency for HF is 1.240461014 s21, which is
given as 124.04 Ts21 or 0.12404 Ps21.
Some of these data are used in the Problem 1.5.
Problem 1.5
(a) Given that 1 eV of energy is equivalent to 0.1602 aJ, use the
information given above to calculate the ionisation energy
of the hydrogen atom to 3 sig. fig. in electron volts (a
common macroscopic energy unit).
(b) Given that the Planck constant, h, has the value
6.626610234 Js, and that vibrational energy, evib, is related
to vibration frequency, v, according to evib 5 hv, calculate
the value of evib for HF to 3 sig. fig.
The results you obtain for Problem 1.5 should show that, since the
joule (J) is a macroscopic base unit of energy, property values on the
microscopic scale have extremely small magnitudes. We now explore
this idea further in Worked Problem 1.3 and in Problem 1.6 to give
more practice in manipulating numbers in scientific form; but, more
importantly, to provide further insight into size differences in the
microscopic and macroscopic worlds.

A. The number of molecules in 1 mol of benzene is equal to
6.022 6 1023 (to 4 sig. fig.). If we assume that a reasonable

multiplying the effective area of each molecule, a, by the
number of molecules in 1 mol, then;

where a 5 p 6 r2 for the area of a disc of radius r. Thus, if we

pitches, n, covered by 1 mol of benzene:
n ~ A

6:02|1023 mol{1 ~3:27|10{22 g:
Thus, the number of atoms per unit cell is:
n~ 1:31|10{21 g
3:27|10{22 g ~4:01:
Cubic close packing implies 4 atoms per unit cell so this result
would seem to conform to our expectation in this case. The
deviation from the theoretically correct result of 4 derives simply
from the precision with which we specify the density, the value for
a, the molar mass of Au and the Avogadro’s constant. If we had
chosen to specify some or all of these quantities to 4 or 5
significant figures rather than 3, then we might reasonably expect
to achieve a better match. It is worth remarking that in carrying
out this type of calculation, we need also consider whether the
metal in question is isotopically pure or not. For example, metallic
copper, which also crystallises in a cubic close-packed structure,
is made up of a mixture of 63Cu and 65Cu. In this case, the
calculated number of Cu atoms per unit cell will be affected by the
difference in isotopic masses in the sample because we assume that
each unit cell has the same isotopic composition (since the
definition of a unit cell describes it as the basic repeating unit).
Problem 1.8
Calculate the number of Au atoms per unit cell to 3 d.p., given
that the molar mass of
197Au (100%) 5 196.97 g mol21,
the density of metallic gold is 19.321 6 103 kg m–3, that

1.1.7 Relationships Between Numbers
Frequently in chemistry we find ourselves considering the significance
of a numerical quantity, associated with some property of a system, in
terms of its relationship to some accepted standard. For example, we
might measure a rate constant which tells us whether a particular
reaction is fast or slow but we can only draw a conclusion in this
respect by comparing it to some standard which we know to imply
one extreme or the other or somewhere in between. Of course, this
activity is important in all areas of life, and highlights the value of
being able to assess how numbers relate to one another. Historically,
this relationship has been made easier by associating numbers with
patterns, as shown in Figure 1.1.
These so-called figurate numbers (in this case, triangular numbers)
are more easily presented in order of increasing magnitude, simply
because it is easy to see that there are more dots to the right than to the
left. By following this convention, it is then straightforward to deduce
the next number in the sequence (here 21, by constructing a triangle
with a row of six dots at the base. Intuitively, we can see that 6 is of
greater (.) magnitude than 3, and of lesser (,) magnitude than 15
simply by counting dots. The mathematical notation for describing
these two relations is 6.3 and 6,15. Such relations are termed
inequalities. Note that it is equally true that 3,6 and 15.6. We can also
combine these two relations into one: either 3,6,15 or 15.6.3.
Problem 1.9
Use the inequality symbols (, and .) to express two relation-
ships between the following pairs of numbers:
(a) 2, 6;
(b) 1.467, 1.469;
(c)
p, e.
The association of numbers with
patterns was common in ancient
Greece. The so-called figurate
numbers 3, 6, 10 and 15 given in
the text are examples of triangu-
lar numbers; other examples
include square (1, 4, 9, 16, 25…)
and pentagonal (1, 5, 12, 22,
35…) numbers.
Figure 1.1
Expressing the
relationship between numbers is
made easier by associating them
with patterns. Their relative
magnitude is easily seen by the
increasing number of dots used to
represent them.

1.1.7.1 Negative Numbers
The question of negative numbers must now be addressed. All negative
numbers are less than zero, and hence we can say immediately that 26
, 3. Furthermore, as 6 . 23, we can obtain the latter inequality from
the former simply by changing the sign of the two numbers
(multiplying through by 21) and reversing the inequality sign.
Problem 1.10
(a) Use inequalities to express the fact that a number given as
2.456 lies between 2.4555 and 2.4565.
(b) Express each of the following inequalities in alternative
ways:
25.35 , 25.34, 25.35 , 5.34.
1.1.7.2 Very Large and Very Small Numbers
The numerical value of the Avogadro’s constant is 6.022 6 1023;
a very large number. An expression of the disparity in the size
between this number and unity may be expressed in the form
6.02261023 & 1; likewise, for the magnitude of the charge on the
electron, we can express its smallness with respect to unity as 1.602 6
10219 % 1.
1.1.7.3 Infinity
The concept of an unquantifiably enormous number is of consider-
able importance to us in many contexts, but probably is most familiar
to us when we think about the size of the universe or the concept of
time as never ending. For example, the sums of the first 100, 1000 and
1000 000 positive integers are 5050, 500 500 and 500 000 500 000,
respectively. If the upper limit is extended to 1000 000 000 and so on,
we see that the total sum increases without limit. Such summations of
numbers – be they integers, rationals or decimal numbers – which
display this behaviour, are said to tend to infinity. The use of the
symbol ? to designate infinity should not be taken to suggest that
infinity is a number: it is not! The symbol ? simply represents the
concept of indefinable, un-ending enormity. It also arises in situations
where a constant is divided by an increasing small number. Thus, the

clearly tends to infinity, whilst the same sequence of negative
terms tends to 2?. Once again, there is no limiting value for the
growing negative number {
1
10{n as the value of n increases (the
denominator decreases towards zero). Although it is tempting to write
1
0 ~?, this statement is devoid of mathematical meaning because we
could then just as easily write 2
0 ~?, which would imply that 152,
which is clearly not the case. We shall see in Chapter 3 how to
evaluate limiting values of expressions in which the denominator
approaches zero.
1.1.7.4 The Magnitude
The magnitude of a number is always positive, and is obtained by
removing any sign: thus, the magnitude of 24.2 is given using the
modulus notation as |24.2| 5 4.2.
Problem 1.11
(a) Give the values of |429|, |2326| and |924|.
(b) Give the limiting values of the numbers 102m, 10m, 2102m
and 210m, as m tends to infinity.
1.2 Algebra
Much of the preceding discussion has concerned numbers and some
of the laws of arithmetic used for their manipulation. In practice,
however, we do not generally undertake arithmetic operations on
numbers obtained from some experimental measurement at the outset
– we need a set of instructions telling us how to process the number(s)
to obtain some useful property of the system. This set of instructions
takes the form of a formula involving constants, of fixed value, and
variables represented by a symbol or letter: the symbols designate
quantities that, at some future stage, we might give specific numerical
values determined by measurements on the system. Formulae of all
kinds are important, and their construction and use are based on the
rules of algebra. The quantity associated with the symbol is usually
called a variable because it can take its value from some given set of
values: these variables may be continuous variables if they can take any
20
Maths for Chemists

value from within some interval of numbers (for example, tempera-
ture or concentration), or they may be discrete variables if their value
is restricted to a discrete set of values, such as a subset of positive
integers (for example, atomic number). One further complicating issue
is that, in processing a number associated with some physical property
of the system, we also have to consider the units associated with that
property. In practice the units are also processed by the formula, but
some care is needed in how to present units within a formula – an
issue discussed later on in Chapter 2. However, the most important
point is that algebra provides us with a tool for advancing from single
one-off calculations to a general formula which provides us with the
means to understand the chemistry. Without formulae, mathematics
and theory, we are in the dark!
1.2.1 Generating a Formula for the Sum of the First n Positive
Integers
Consider first the simple problem of summing the integers 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5. The result by arithmetic (mental or otherwise) is 15. However,
what if we want to sum the integers from 1 to 20? We can accomplish
this easily enough by typing the numbers into a calculator or adding
them in our head, to obtain the result 210, but the process becomes
somewhat more tedious. Now, if we want to sum the sequence of
integers from 1 to some, as yet unspecified, upper limit, denoted by
the letter n, we need a formula that allows us to evaluate this sum,
without actually having to add each of the numbers individually. We
can accomplish this as follows:
N Write down the sum of the first five integers, 1 to 5, from highest to
lowest, and introduce the symbol Ss to represent this sum:
S5 ~ 5 z 4 z 3 z 2 z 1
N Repeat the exercise by summing the same five integers from lowest
to highest:
S5 ~ 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z 5
N Add the two expressions to obtain:
2S5 ~ 6 z 6 z 6 z6 z 6 ~ 5 | 6 ~ 30 ) S5 ~ 15,
where the symbol ) means ‘implies’.
Symbols used to represent vari-
ables or constants in a
formula may additionally have
subscripts and/or superscripts
attached. For example, x1, k2 and
A12.
Numbers and Algebra
21

If we repeat this procedure for the first six integers, rather than the
first five, we obtain:
2S6 ~ 7 z 7 z 7 z 7 z 7 z 7 ~ 6|7 ~ 42 ) S6 ~ 21:
We can see that in each case, the respective sum is obtained by
multiplying the number of integers, n, in the sum by the same number
incremented by 1, and dividing the result by 2: that is:
S5~ 5|6
2
~15
S6~ 6|7
2
~21:
Problem 1.12
Use the result given above to deduce expressions that yield the
sum of the first:
(a) 100 positive integers;
(b) 68 negative integers.
The pattern should now be apparent, and we can generalise the
expression for the sum of the first n positive integers by multiplying n
by n+1, and dividing the result by 2:
Sn~ n| nz1
ð
Þ
2
It is usual practice, when symbols are involved, to drop explicit use
of the multiplication sign 6, thus enabling the formula for Sn to be
given in the form:
Sn~ n nz1
ð
Þ
2
ð1:7Þ
We can test our new formula, by using it to determine the sum of
the positive integers from 1 to 20:
S20~ 20|21
2
~210
22
Maths for Chemists

1.2.2 Algebraic Manipulation
The rules for manipulating algebraic symbols are the same as those
for numbers: thus we can formally add, subtract, multiply and divide
combinations of symbols, just as if they were numbers. In the example
given above, we have used parentheses to avoid ambiguity in how to
evaluate the sum. The general rules for expanding expressions in
parentheses ( ), brackets [ ] or braces { } take the following forms:
a b z c
ð
Þ ~ ab z ac ~ b z c
ð
Þa
ð1:8Þ
and
b z c
ð
Þ=d ~ b = d z c = d:
ð1:9Þ
When we want to multiply two expressions in parentheses together,
the first rule is simply applied twice. Thus, if we are given the
expression(a + b)(c + d), we can expand by letting X 5 (a + b), and
then:
a z b
ð
Þ c z d
ð
Þ ~ X c z d
ð
Þ ~ Xc z Xd
~ a z b
ð
Þc z a z b
ð
Þd
~ ac z bc z ad z bd:
ð1:10Þ
We can use these rules to expand our expression for the sum of n
integers above to obtain either
Sn ~ n2 = 2 z n = 2 or Sn ~ n = 2 z n2 = 2:
However, it would be usual in this case to stick to our original
expression because it is more compact and aesthetically pleasing.

A Formula of Chemical Importance
The spin of a proton has two orientations with respect to the
direction of a homogeneous magnetic field: either ‘spin up’ or
‘spin down’, often represented by the arrows q or Q,
respectively. In an NMR experiment, the two orientations have
different energies. Let us now consider how many possible spin
combinations there are for two and for three equivalent
protons, and then derive the result for n equivalent protons.
For two equivalent protons, the first proton can have one of
two possible spin states, spin up or spin down. Each of these can

combine with either one of the spin states possible for the second
proton. Thus the total number of two-spin state combinations is
2 6 2 5 22 (a result which is more useful than the arithmetic
result, 4). The four two-spin states are as follows:
First spin state ‘up’:
qq qQ
First spin state ‘down’: Qq QQ
If we now include a third equivalent proton, as would be appro-
priate for the methyl group, each parent two-spin state gives rise to
two three-spin states – thus doubling the overall number of spin
states to yield a total of 2 6 22 5 23 which is, of course 8:
First two-spin state:
qqq qqQ
Second two-spin state: qQq qQQ
Third two-spin state:
Qqq QqQ
Fourth two-spin state: QQq QQQ
It should now be apparent that, for each additional equivalent
proton, the number of spin states is doubled: thus, for 4 pro-
tons, there are 24 spin states and hence, for n equivalent protons,
there are 2n spin states.
Problem 1.13
The nuclear spin of the deuteron, which has a spin quantum
number I of 1, can have three orientations, represented
symbolically by q, R, Q. The expression derived above for
two-spin state systems can readily be extended to any number of
spin states – thus for n equivalent nuclei having m possible spin
orientations, the number of possible spin states is given by mn.
(a) Deduce the number of three-spin states for the CD2 radical
(where D is the chemical symbol for deuterium). Now do
the same for a fully deuterated methyl radical.
(b) Given that there are 2I + 1 spin states for a nuclear spin
quantum number, I, give the number of spin states
associated with n equivalent nuclei with spin I.
(c)
State the number of nuclear spin states for a single atom of
51V, which has a nuclear spin quantum number of 7=2 (this
is useful for understanding the electronic characteristics of
complexes of vanadium).
The deuteron is the name given
to the nucleus of deuterium which
contains one proton and one
neutron.

1.2.2.1 Dealing with Negative and Positive Signs
In the algebraic expressions considered so far, all the constituent
terms carried a positive sign. In general, however, we have to work
with expressions involving terms carrying positive or negative signs.
Dealing with signed terms is straightforward when we appreciate that
a negative or positive sign associated with a number or symbol simply
implies the operation, multiply by –1 or +1, respectively. For example,
the operation:
{a
ð
Þ | {b
ð
Þ
is equivalent to writing
{1 | a | {1 | b ~ {1 | {1

Þ | a | b ~ ab:
A simple set of rules can be constructed, using this reasoning, to help
us to carry out multiplication and division of signed numbers or
symbols:
These rules are valid if a, b are numbers, symbols, or algebraic
expressions.

1.2.2.2 Working with Rational Expressions
A rational expression (often called a quotient) takes the form a
b, where
a and b may be simple or complicated expressions. In many instances,
it is necessary to simplify the appearance of such expressions by
searching for common factors (symbols or numbers common to each
term) and, if necessary, by deleting such factors in both the numerator
and denominator. For example, in:
3x2{12xy
3
,
the numerator has 3 and x as common factors, whereas the
denominator has 3. Since the denominator and numerator both have
the common factor 3, this may be cancelled from each term to give:
x2{4xy
1
~x2{4xy,
which simplifies further to x(x 2 4y), once the common factor x has
been removed from each term. In this case, the rational expression
reduces to a simple expression. We should also be aware that,
whenever we are faced with a rational expression involving symbols, it
is necessary to specify that any symbol appearing as a common factor,
in both numerator and denominator, cannot take the value zero,
26

because otherwise the resulting expression would become 0
0, which is
indeterminate (i.e. meaningless!).

1.2.3 Polynomials
A polynomial is represented by a sum of symbols raised to different
powers, each with a different coefficient; for example, 3x3 2 2x + 1
involves a sum of x raised to the third, first and zeroth powers
(remember that x0 5 1) with coefficients 3,22 and 1, respectively. The
highest power indicates the degree of the polynomial and so, for this
example, the expression is a polynomial of the third degree.
1.2.3.1 Factorising a Polynomial
Since x does not appear in all three terms in the polynomial 3x3 2 2x + 1,
it cannot be common factor. However, if we can find a number a, such
that 3a3 2 2a + 1 5 0, then x 2 a is a common factor of the polynomial.
Thus, in order to factorise the example given, we need first to solve the
expression:
3a3 { 2a z 1 ~ 0:
Trial and error shows that a 5 21 is a solution of this equation, which
means that x 2 (21) 5 x + 1 is a factor of 3x3 2 2x + 1. It is
now possible to express 3x3 2 2x + 1 in the form (x + 1)(3x2 2 3x 2 1).
Note that the second degree polynomial in parentheses does, in fact,
factorise further, but the resulting expression is not very simple in
appearance.

1.2.4 Coping with Units
In chemistry, we work with algebraic expressions involving symbols
representing particular properties or quantities, such as temperature,
concentration, wavelength and so on. Any physical quantity is
described in terms, not only of its magnitude but also of its dimensions;
the latter giving rise to units, the natures of which are determined by
the chosen system of units. In chemistry, we use the S.I. system of
units: for example, if we specify a temperature of 273 K, then the
28
Maths for Chemists

dimension is temperature, usually given the symbol T, the magnitude
is 273 and the base unit of temperature is Kelvin, with name K.
Similarly, a distance between nuclei of 150 pm in a molecule has
dimensions of length, given the symbol l, a magnitude of 150 and a
unit of pm (10212 m). All such physical quantities must be thought of
as the product of the magnitude, given by a number, and the
appropriate unit(s), specified by one or more names. Since each
symbol representing a physical quantity is understood to involve a
number and appropriate units (unless we are dealing with a pure
number such as percentage absorbance in spectroscopy), we treat the
property symbols and unit names as algebraic quantities. All the usual
rules apply and, for example, in the case of:
N The molar energy property, E, we may wish to use the rules of
indices to write E 5 200 kJ/mol as 200 kJ mol–1.
N Concentration, c, we are concerned with amount of substance
(name is n, unit is mol) per unit volume (name is V, unit is m3).
If necessary, as seen earlier, we can manipulate the various prefixes for
the S.I. base units as required. Further practice is given in the
following problem.
Problem 1.19
(a) The expression RT
F
occurs widely in electrochemistry. The
gas constant, R, has units J K–1 mol–1 ; the Faraday
constant, F, has units C mol21, and temperature, T, is
measured in K. Given that 1 coulomb volt (CV) is
equivalent to 1 joule (J), find the units of the given
expression.
(b) The Rydberg constant, R?~ mee4
8h3ce02, occurs in models used
for interpreting atomic spectral data; me is the mass of the
electron (kg), e is the elementary charge (C), c is the speed
of light (m s–1), e0 is the vacuum permitivity ( J–1 C2 m–1 ),
and h the Planck constant (J s). Given that 1 J is equivalent
to 1 kg m2 s22, find the units of R‘.

Functions and Equations:
Their Form and Use
As we saw in Chapter 1, the importance of numbers in chemistry
derives from the fact that experimental measurement of a particular
chemical or physical property will always yield a numerical value to
which we attach some significance. This might involve direct
measurement of an intrinsic property of an atom or molecule, such
as ionisation energy or conductivity, but, more frequently, we find it
necessary to use theory to relate the measured property to other
properties of the system. For example, the rotational constant, B,
for the diatomic molecule CO can be obtained directly from a
measurement of the separation of adjacent rotational lines in the
infrared spectrum. Theory provides the link between the measured
rotational constant and the moment of inertia, I, of the molecule by
the formula:
B~
h
8p2Ic ,
where h is Planck’s constant and c is the speed of light. The moment
of inertia itself is related to the square of the bond length of the
molecule by:
I ~ mr2,
where m is the reduced mass. The relationship between B and r was
originally derived, in part, from the application of quantum
mechanics to the problem of the rigid rotor. In general, relationships
between one chemical or physical property of a system and another
are described by mathematical functions. Such functions are
especially important for building the mathematical models we need
to predict changes in given property values that result from changes in
the parameters defining the system – if we can predict such changes
then we are well on the way to understanding our system better!
However, before we can explore these applications further, we have to
define function in its mathematical sense. This is a necessary step
For a diatomic molecule, AB, the
reduced mass is given by
m~ mAmB
mAzmB
where mA and mB
are the masses of A and B,
respectively.

the issue.

measurement of angles.
N Be familiar with the use of trigonometric identities and
addition formulae.
2.1 Defining Functions
Our aim in this section is to show what features need to be understood
in order to define a function properly as a mathematical object. First
of all, let us consider the association between an arbitrary number, x,
and the number 2x + 1. We can thus associate the number 6 with 13, p
with 2p + 1, 1.414 with 3.828, and so on. It is conventional practice to
express this association as a formula, or equation:
y ~ 2x z 1,
where the unspecified number, x, is the input number for the formula,
and y the output number. Before we can say that this association
expresses y as a function of x, we need to:
32
Maths for Chemists

N Specify the set of numbers for which the formula applies (the domain)
N Check that each value of x is associated with only one value of y.
In the present example, we could specify the domain as either the
collection of all real numbers (conventionally described as the set R),
or the set of all integers, I, or a subset of either or both, thereby
satisfying the first requirement.
We can also see in this case that any number chosen as input
generates a single number, y, as output and so the second requirement
is also satisfied. It is very important to keep in mind that the function
is defined not only by the formula but also by the domain:
consequently, if we specify that the formula y 5 2x + 1 applies to
any real number as input, x, then we can define the function y 5 f(x)
where f(x) 5 2x + 1 with domain R. In this case f is the name of the
function that describes both the formula and the permitted values of
x. If we had specified that the same formula y 5 2x + 1 is used with
the domain consisting of all integers, I, then we would be dealing with
a different function, which we might wish to call y 5 g(x). For both
functions, y is the number produced by the formula for a given x
defined within the specified domain of the function. The association
between x and y defines different functions for different subsets of
numbers – although the formula of association is the same. Where a
function is defined by a formula, and the domain is not explicitly
stated, then it is assumed that the domain consists of all real numbers
for which the function has a real value. This is called the natural
domain of the function.

A. The value of f(x) is indeterminate for x 5 4 and x 5 23

It is often not necessary to specify the domain explicitly, as
any restrictions are evident from the formula: this is especially
true in the chemical context.
The symbols x and y, used in the function formulae, are con-
ventionally termed the independent variable and dependent variable,
respectively. This terminology conveys the idea that we are free to
assign values to the independent variable but that, once we have done
so, a unique value for the dependent variable results. A function may
have more than one independent variable, in which case a domain
needs to be specified for each variable. For example, the formula:
y ~ pq = r
expresses an association between the three independent variables p,
q and r and the dependent variable y. The domain is defined by
specifying the permitted values associated with each of the
independent variables. Having checked that only one value of the
dependent variable results for a given set of values of p, q and r, we
may then define the function:
y ~ f p, q, r
ð
Þ ~ pq = r:
ð2:1Þ
In practice, although many functions that we meet in a chemical
context have more than one independent variable, the function may
be reduced to a single variable by specifying that one or more of the
other variables remain constant.
Frequently, we specify functions by formulae that do not explicitly
involve a dependent variable, but express the function simply in terms
of the formula and the label used to denote the function. For example,
the formula f(x) 5 2x + 1 defines the function f that associates the
number 2x + 1 with the number x. Thus, f(25) 5 29 implies that f
associates –9 with –5, while f(3) 5 7 implies that f associates 7 with 3.
Although this way of presenting the function does not involve a
dependent variable, we can introduce one by letting y 5 f(x), and
rewriting the function as y 5 2x + 1. The most frequently encountered
labels used for the independent and dependent variables are x and y,
respectively, but these labels are entirely arbitrary. We might just
as easily use the labels p and r or w and r; similarly, when
The symbol s means ‘‘is an
element of’’ or alternatively
‘‘belongs to’’. Thus x s R means
that ‘‘x is an element of the set of
real numbers’’.

labelling the function, instead of f we might use g, h, F or y, or indeed
any label which we think appropriate: for example, if we wanted to
collectively label the group of 1s, 2s, 3s,… atomic orbital functions,
we might use the name w and then distinguish each function using a
numbered suffix, say, w1, w2 and w3. Our choice here is entirely
arbitrary, but is designed to allow us, in this case, to group similar
types of functions under a common name. You could rightly argue
that the labels w1, w2 and w3 provide little that the labels 1s, 2s, 3s,…
do not: the point here is that either will do, and it is really just a
matter of taste, context, convenience or convention that dictates what
labels and names we use. It is very important that we do not allow
unfamiliar labels to give the impression that an otherwise straightfor-
ward association or function is more complicated than it actually is!
Worked Problem 2.2
Q. The energies of the electron orbits in Bohr’s model of the
hydrogen atom take discrete values according to the expression,
En~ {mee4
8e02h2n2 , where me and e are the mass and charge of the
electron, respectively, h is Planck’s constant, e0 is the vacuum
permittivity and n is the principal quantum number. Write
down an equivalent expression using the labels x and y for the
independent and dependent variables, respectively, and any
labels you feel appropriate for the constants.
A. The formula for En has exactly the same mathematical form
as the formula y 5 2ax22. The energy En is the dependent
variable, equivalent to y in the second formula and carries units
of J. The principal quantum number, n, is the independent
variable, equivalent to x, and can take only integer values
greater than or equal to 1. The constants me, e, h and e0, can be
collected together into a single constant, equivalent to a in the
second formula. The domain of the original formula is restricted
to all positive integers. However, this restriction may not
necessarily apply to the second formula, which might have as
domain all real numbers, for example. Consequently, although
the formulae are identical in form, we define two distinct
functions, which are distinguished from each other by their
domains.
Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
35

The requirement that a function be single-valued, for a given input
value for the independent variable, will hold for the majority of
associations between one number and another. However, the
association between any real number and its square root always
yields both a positive and a negative result. For example, the two
square roots of 9 are ¡3, and so we say that 9 is associated with both
–3 and 3. Thus, if we write this association as y 5 x1/2, then we cannot
define the function y 5 f(x) 5 x1/2. However, if we explicitly limit the
values of y to the positive (or negative) roots only, then we can
redefine the association as a single-valued function. Alternatively, if
we square both sides to yield y2 5 x, we can take the association
between x now as dependent variable and y as independent variable
and define the function x 5 g(x) 5 y2 for which there is only one
value of x for any value of y.
An everyday example might be the association between price
and item in a supermarket. As there are in all likelihood many items
that have the same price, we cannot describe this association as a
function; however, the association of item with price does define a
function, as each article has only one price. In this latter case, the
domain of the function is simply a list of all items for sale in the
supermarket.

2.1.1 Functions in a Chemical Context
As we have seen in the previous section, functions involve associations
between numbers. However, when we work with functions in a
chemical context, we have to recognise that any association involving
chemical properties necessarily involves units. Consider, for example,
the relation between atomic number, Z, and atomic first ionisation
energy, IE. While there are clearly no units associated with atomic
number, the ionisation energy, IE, has units of kJ mol–1 (although we

could just as easily have chosen any other unit of energy such as eV,
cm-1, J, kcal mol-1 and so on). In this example, there is clearly a
relation between the subset of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, … 116),
corresponding to Z, and the subset of the 116 decimal numbers
corresponding to the values of IE / kJ mol–1. Note that the association
remains between two numbers devoid of units because, in the case of
the ionisation energy, we have divided IE by the units of energy
chosen. For example, in the case of atomic nitrogen, where Z 5 7, and
IE / kJ mol–1 5 1402.3, there is a relation between the positive integer
7, and the decimal number 1402.3. This relation has physical meaning
only for positive integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or
equal to 116 (alternatively written as 1 ¡ Z ¡ 116), since each value
of IE / kJ mol21 is associated with only one positive integer in the
subset of integers already identified. Hence, in mathematical terms,
we say that the relation, or association, just described defines a
function, as we have specified both the domain for which the
association is valid, and also checked that each number, Z, of the
domain has an association with only one decimal number.
In most chemical problems we usually deal with functions that are
defined in terms of a formula, in which the permitted values for the
variables appearing in the formula (given by symbols) are determined
by physical considerations. For example, in the case of temperature
on the absolute (Kelvin) scale, negative values have no physical basis
in reality.
In the next section, we explore in more detail the role that units play
in the relation of formula and function.
2.1.1.1 Understanding the Role of Units – The Mathematically Correct
Approach
Consider the ideal gas law, expressed in terms of the simple formula:
P ~ nRT = V
ð2:2Þ
where the symbols have the following roles: P is the pressure, n is the
amount of gas, V is the volume, T is the temperature and R is the gas
constant. Each of the properties listed has associated units, and the
units on both sides of eqn (2.2) must be equivalent, or equal. In the
S.I. convention, the following choices of units are common, with
the equivalent combinations of base S.I. units also given, where
appropriate: P in Pa (pascal), atm, or bar, which are names defining
appropriate multiples of the base units kg m21 s22; n in mol; V in m3;
T in K; R 5 8.314 J K21 mol21, equivalent to kg m2 s22 K21 mol21.
Thus, on the left-hand side of the formula the units are kg m21 s22,
Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
37

and on the right side, we have mol kg m2 s22 K21 mol21 K / m3 5 kg
m21 s22, as required.
The ideal gas equation is the outcome of a model devised for
understanding the properties of a gas, in which there is no interaction
between the atoms or molecules occupying the volume, V. In
mathematical terms, however, this ideal gas equation remains a
formula until we know how to use it as a function, a key aspect of
which is developed next.
2.1.1.2 Creating a Function from a Formula
As already noted, the ideal gas formula involves symbols that are
associated with a value and its associated units. As we know that the
units on the left- and right-hand sides of the formula are the same and
therefore cancel, we can express each symbol as a value multiplied by
appropriate units, leaving us with a relation involving new symbols
that stand for numerical values in the ordinary sense of algebra. In
particular, if we make the following substitutions:
P ~ p Pa; n ~ n mol; R ~ r J K{1 mol{1; V ~ v m3; T ~ t K,
then the formula:
P~ nRT
V
ð2:3Þ
takes the form:
p Pa~ n mol r J K{1mol{1t K
v m3
ð2:4Þ
which, on cancelling the units, becomes:
p~ nrt
v
ð2:5Þ
where p, n¯, r, t, v are positive numbers, with t also permitted to take
the value zero. In this case, we see that p is a function of the three
variables, n¯, t and v (r is a constant). However, if the amount of
gas and either temperature or volume is held constant, then there is
only one independent variable and, in these circumstances, we say
that p is proportional to t or that p is inversely proportional to v,
respectively:
p ! t or p ! 1=v:
The constants of proportionality are given by n¯r / v or by n¯rt,
respectively. In each case, we can collect our constants together and
38
Maths for Chemists

re-label them as a single constant, expressed using a new symbol.
Thus, we can express the ideal gas law as:
p ~ bt or p ~ c = v,
where b 5 n¯r /v and c 5 n¯rt.
2.1.1.3 Understanding the Role of Units – The Pragmatic Approach
In the discussion above, we have seen how a formula involving
chemical properties may be converted into a function, essentially by
removing the units. This procedure works because the units must
balance on each side of the equality (5) defining the formula or
association. It is very easy to become confused by the distinction
between formula and function and the role that units play in defining
this distinction. The approach detailed above describes how to treat
units in a mathematically correct fashion, but in practice the more
pragmatic approach is to simply ignore the units and treat a formula
describing some physical relationship as a function (for which the
domain is the physically meaningful range of values for the
independent variable). Consequently, we find that in most chemistry
texts there is an understandable degree of mathematical looseness,
which skates over this distinction between formula and function in a
chemical context, and frequently results in the units being ignored.
For example, it is often stated that the ideal gas law indicates that P is
a function of T and V, in which P 3 T and P 3 1 / V. The latter two
statements are, of course, true, so long as it is understood that the
proportionality constants carry the units of pressure divided by
temperature and pressure multiplied by volume, respectively. It is not
our intention here to add unnecessary levels of complexity, but it is
nevertheless important to be aware of the role that units play and of
the distinction between formula and function in the chemical context.
We shall return to this problem of units in the next section, where we
consider methods used for representing functions.
Worked Problem 2.3
The conventional wisdom in theories of molecular structure
presented in organic chemistry is that the strength of a bond
between identical atoms increases with increasing bond order
and decreasing bond length. Thus, for example, the bond
energy, BE / J mol21, of a C;C triple bond is greater than a
C5C double bond, which in turn is greater than a C2C single
bond. As the bond length is inversely proportional to bond

order, we can make a rough approximation that the bond
energy, BE / J mol21 is inversely proportional to bond length.
Thus:

Q. Give the units of the constant of proportionality in terms of

L
Dividing through by m on both sides gives:
BE
kg m3 s{2mol{1 ! 1
L
and so we see that in order for the units to balance on both
sides, the constant of proportionality must have units equivalent
to the those appearing in the denominator on the left-hand side,
i.e. kg m3 s22 mol21.
A less rigorous, and somewhat more transparent, approach
involves writing down the relationship between binding energy
and bond length:
BE! 1
L :
If we replace each of the symbols BE and L by their appropriate
units we have:
kg m2 s{2 mol{1! 1
m
and so in order to replace the proportionality symbol (3) by the
equality symbol (5) we introduce the constant of proportion-
ality which must have units of:
kg m2 s{2 mol{1 |m ~ kg m3 s{2 mol{1:

Problem 2.2
The movement of ions with charge ze (where z is a small positive
or negative integer, and e is the fundamental unit of charge)
through a solution, subject to an external electric field, E, is
determined by the balance between the force arising from the
electric field and the viscosity, g, of the solution. The parameter,
s, termed the drift speed, gives a measure of the conductivity,
and is evaluated using the formula:
s~ e z E
6pga ,
where a is the effective radius of the ion. Given that the units of
e, E, g and a are C, V m21, m21 kg s21 and m, respectively, give
the units of s (remember that C V 5 J, and J 5 kg m2 s22).
2.2 Representation of Functions
Functions of a single variable, involving a relation between two sets
of numbers, may be expressed in terms of a table (expressing an
association), formula, prescription or graphical plot. For functions of
two independent variables (see below), the preferred representations
are formula, prescription or graphical plot; for three or more varia-
bles, a formula or prescription are the only realistic representations.
2.2.1 Tabular Representations of Functions of a Single Variable
The function y 5 g(x), where g(x) 5 2x + 1, with the domain
consisting of the integers from –5 to 5, can most easily be expressed in
tabular form (see Table 2.1). For each value of x there exists one
value of y.
It is clear that there are 11 numbers (elements) in the domain.
However, it is not possible to present the function f(x) 5 2x + 1,
with the domain of all real numbers from –5 to 5, in tabular form, as
there is an infinite number of elements in the domain. The formula

f(x) 5 2x + 1 is the most effective non-graphical way of specifying this
function, with the domain as specified above.
2.2.2 Graphical Representations of Functions of a Single Variable
For the function y 5 f(x), each ordered pair of numbers, (x, y), can be
used to define the co-ordinates of a point in a plane, and thus can be
represented by a graphical plot, in which the origin, O, with
coordinates (0, 0), lies at the intersection of two perpendicular axes.
A number on the horizontal x-axis is known as the abscissa, and
defines the x-coordinate of a point in the plane; likewise, a number
on the (vertical) y-axis is known as the ordinate, and defines the y-
coordinate of the point. Thus, an arbitrary point (x, y) in the plane
lies at a perpendicular distance |x| from on the y-axis and |y| from the
x-axis. If x . 0, the point lies to the right of the y-axis and if x , 0, it
lies to the left. Similarly, if y . 0, the point lies above the x-axis, and if
y , 0, it lies below (see Figure 2.1).
For functions such as y 5 g(x), where g(x) 5 2x + 1, the most
appropriate type of plot is a point plot if the domain is limited to
integers lying within some range. Figure 2.2 displays such a plot for
this function, which is defined only at the eleven values of x in its
domain (indicated by open circles).
Strictly speaking, it is not appropriate to connect the points with a
line, as this would imply that the function is defined at points other
Figure 2.1

coordinate system used to
represent the points (3, 3) and
(23, 23) in the plane defined in
terms of coordinates referenced

42

than at the integers from –5 to +5. However, in some instances, as we
shall see below, it may be appropriate to connect the data points with
straight line segments in order to guide the eye, but this has no
mathematical significance. In contrast, the line plot of the function
y 5 f(x) 5 2x + 1 is created by taking a sufficient number of points in
its domain to enable a smooth curve to be drawn (Figure 2.3). In this
case, it would be similarly misleading to represent this plot as a series
of discrete points, no matter how small the gap between adjacent
points. The only correct way of representing this function is by a
smoothly varying line plot, but, of course, in practice, we recognise
that the logistics of generating a graphical line plot involve arbitrarily
selecting discrete points within the domain and then joining the
points. This applies equally whether we are drawing the plot by hand
or using a computer plotting program.
2.2.2.1 A Chemical Example of a Point Plot
Consider the association between atomic first ionisation energy, IE,
and atomic number Z (a positive integer). It is convenient to use the
electron-volt unit, eV, where 1eV 5 96.485 kJ mol21. As there is no
formula to express this association, we present the function first in the
form of a table and then as a point plot; and in both representations,
we take as domain the Z values for the first eighteen elements. Since
Figure 2.2
A point plot
illustrating the values of the
function y 5 g(x) 5 2x + 1 in its
domain [–5, 5].
Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
43

units have to be removed in order to define a function, we consider in
Table 2.2 the association of Z with IE / eV:
The data in the table are now displayed in graphical form as a point
plot (or scatter plot) in Figure 2.4, with points defined by the number
pairs ( Z, IE / eV). In this procedure, Z is specified as abscissa (x-axis)
and IE / eV as ordinate (y-axis).
For every value of Z there is clearly only one value for the
ionisation energy, which establishes a function with domain given by
the set of the first eighteen positive integers, a subset of the atomic
numbers of the 116 elements in the Periodic Table. In this example,
the fact that the data points are connected by dashed straight line
segments has no mathematical significance; it simply acts as a visual
aid to improve the display of the trends in IE / eV values.
There are many situations where we are unable to provide a
formula that relates one chemical property with another, although,
intuitively, one may be expected. Thus, in the example given above, it

is not possible to construct a model, based on a formula, that relates
Z to IE / eV for atoms containing more than one electron (although a
simple relationship does exist for one-electron species, if we ignore
relativistic effects). However, regardless of whether a particular
problem is as intractable as this one, we can only enhance our
understanding of chemistry by using the mathematical tools at our
disposal to develop new models to crack particular chemical ‘nuts’! As
an example of this kind of model development, we now consider some
pressure/volume data for a real gas in order to test the ideal gas law,
derived from the Boyle model, and to see how we can refine the law to
find a better ‘fit’ to our data.
In Section 2.1.1, we saw that, for an ideal gas, the numerical values
of the pressure, p, and volume, v, are related according to p 3 1 / v, or
p 5 c / v, where c 5 n¯rt (a constant). We can now explore how well the
ideal gas law works for a real gas by considering experimental data1
for 1 mol of CO2 at T 5 313K. The ideal gas law suggests that
pressure is inversely proportional to the volume and so in the first two
rows of Table 2.3, we present the variation of p with 1 / v for the
experimental data (note that the working units for the pressure and
volume in this case are atm and dm3, respectively). In the third row,
we show values for 1 / vB, obtained using the ideal gas equation,
where, in this case, the constant of proportionality c 5 25.6838 at T 5
313 K. The data in the fourth and fifth rows derive from a refinement
to the model, discussed below.
It should be quite obvious that, although the model provided in the
form of the ideal gas law does a reasonable job at lower pressures, it

Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
45

rapidly deviates as the pressure increases and the volume decreases.
We can see this more clearly in Figure 2.5, in which we compare the
real data with that derived from the ideal gas law in a scatter plot of p
vs 1 / v. We can see from our plot that the experimental data, shown as
solid circles, are modelled reasonably well by a linear (straight line)
function, but only for pressures less than 50 atm. The Boyle model is
clearly of limited applicability in this case.

of 2.645 atm dm6 mol–2 and 3.025 6 10–2 dm3 mol–1, respectively.
The book values for a and b are 3.592 atm dm6 mol–2 and 4.267 6
10–2 dm3 mol–1, respectively.2 The differences arise from the limited
number of data points available to us, but we can see that in spite of
this our fitted values for a and b are of the same order of magnitude as
the book values. If we now compare a scatter plot of p vs 1 / vVDW,FIT,
using our fitted values for a and b (Figure 2.6), we see that, although
the fit to our experimental data is really quite good in both the low
and high pressure regions, it is quite poor in the region of the critical
point where we have a point of inflection on our plot (see Chapter 4).
Using the book values for the van der Waals constants gives a
reasonable fit below 50 atm but increasingly poorer fits to higher
pressures; however, the fit in the critical region is much better than
that achieved from our fitted values for a and b. While we have not
been able to construct a model that fits the experimental data
perfectly, it is a considerable improvement on the Boyle model and
allows some insight into what factors might be causing the deviation
from ideal gas behaviour. Furthermore, our model provides a starting
point for further refinements, which might focus, for example, on
improving the model for different regions of the domain (such as in
the critical region) or even taking a different approach altogether,

The modulus function in eqn (2.7) is an example of a function

domain into two subintervals, in each of which the formula takes a
different form. Further examples of this type of behaviour are
described in Chapter 3.

2.2.3.1 Prescription Functions in Chemistry
Functions, specified in the form of a prescription are required when
describing properties of chemical systems that undergo phase
changes. For example:
N The function describing the change in entropy, as a function of
temperature, involves the use of a prescription that contains a
formula specific to a particular phase. At each phase transition
temperature, the function suffers a finite jump in value because of
the sudden change in thermodynamic properties. For example, at
the boiling point Tb, the sudden change in entropy is due to the
latent heat of evaporation (see Figure 2.8).
N The function describing the change in equilibrium concentration of
a given species following a sudden rise in temperature (in a so-
called temperature jump experiment), has two parts, corresponding
to times before and after the temperature jump (see Figure 2.9).
2.3 Some Special Mathematical Functions
There are many different kinds of function in mathematics, but in this
chapter, we shall restrict the discussion to those transcendental
functions, such as exponential, logarithm and trigonometric functions,
that have widespread use in chemistry.
2.3.1 Exponential Functions
In Chapter 1, we saw that there are 2n spin states for n equivalent
protons, where the physics of such systems requires that n ¢ 1. If we
now change the name of the independent variable from n to x, we can

entropy as a function of
temperature. The discontinuities
occur at phase changes.
Transcendental functions are
mathematical functions which
cannot be specified in terms of a
simple algebraic expression
involving a finite number of ele-
mentary operations (+, –, 4, 6).
By definition, functions which are
not transcendental are called
algebraic functions.

define the function y 5 f(x) 5 2x with a domain, for example, initially
restricted to the integer values –4 to +4. We have displayed this
function as a scatter plot in Figure 2.10. If we now extend the
domain to any real value for x, we can define the exponential function
y 5 g(x) 5 2x, with base equal to 2, part of which is displayed in
Figure 2.10 as the full line plot.

Maths for Chemists

In chemistry, apart from base 2, which we meet rather infrequently,
we also encounter exponential functions with base 10 in, for example
relating pH to the activity, a, of hydronium ions in aqueous solutions,
using the formula a 5 102pH. However, the base most commonly
encountered is provided by the unexpectedly strange, irrational
number e, which has the value 2.718 281 828… This base arises when
describing growth and decay processes in chemistry, e.g. in kinetics, in
which changes in concentration with respect to time are the focus of
attention, and in quantum chemistry, in which we are interested in the
changes in the probability density function for finding an electron at
a particular point in space. In a mathematical context, however, e
defines the base of the natural logarithm function (see below), and
also has a major role in calculus (Chapter 4).
In comparing exponential functions with different bases, the larger
the base, the more rapidly the value of the function increases with
increasingly large positive values of x, and decreases with increasingly
negative values of x. The value of y at x 5 0 is unity, irrespective of
the choice of base. Regardless of the choice of base, exponential
functions display a horizontal asymptote at y 5 0: as x takes on
increasingly large negative values, the curve approaches the line y 5 0
but never crosses it. We explore the limiting behaviour of functions in
more detail in Chapter 3.

can only be visualised graphically using a point plot (see Figure 2.12).

2.3.2 Logarithm Functions
Logarithm functions appear widely in a chemical context. For
example, in studying:
N The thermodynamic properties of an ensemble of atoms or
molecules.
N The model equations for first and second order kinetics.
N The temperature dependence of equilibrium constants.
2.3.2.1 Defining the Logarithm Function
If y 5 ax (a is the base), then we define the logarithm to the base a of y
to be x, i.e.
loga y ~ x
ð2:9Þ
It follows that:
alogay~ax~y
ð2:10Þ
2.3.2.2 Properties of Logarithms

from the definition:
loga y1y2
ð
Þ~loga ax1zx2
ð

ð2:11Þ
However, again from the definition, we have loga y1 5 x1 and
loga y2 5 x2, and hence:
loga y1y2
ð
Þ~loga y1zlogay2:
ð2:12Þ
By a simple extension of this argument, we find that:

Þ~n loga y:
ð2:13Þ
Note that this applies equally if the index is negative; thus:
loga y{n

2.3.3 Trigonometric Functions
Consider the right-angled triangle shown in Figure 2.13:
The basic trigonometric functions sine and cosine, given the names
sin and cos, respectively, are defined using the ratios of the side-
lengths of a right-angled triangle as:
sin h~ BC
AB
ð2:19Þ
and:
cosh~ BC
AB
ð2:20Þ
Figure 2.13

Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
55

The sides of a right-angled triangle are referred to as the adjacent or
base (AC), opposite or perpendicular (BC) and hypotenuse (AB),
opposite the right-angle. The tangent of the angle h is given by the
quotient of sin h and cos h:
tan h~ sin h
cos h ~ BC
AC :
ð2:21Þ
2.3.3.1 The Question of Angle
Figure 2.13 shows a circle of radius r and an arc (a portion of the
circumference) of length s, subtended by the angle h. There are two
basic measures of the angle h. The first, and probably more familiar,
is the degree. The angle, h, has the value of one degree if the arc-length
s is equal to one 360th of the circumference of the circle; and so a
complete revolution corresponds to 360 degrees, with half a
revolution corresponding to 180 degrees, and a quarter to 90 degrees
(a right angle) (see Figure 2.14). The second measure of angle is the
radian; one radian is the angle made when the arc length is equal to
the radius of the circle; in other words, it is defined in terms of the
ratio of arc length to radius, i.e. h 5 s / r. As the circumference of the
circle is equal to 2pr, it follows that there must be 2p radians in one
complete revolution, p radians in half a revolution, and p/2 in a
quarter revolution. Since p radians is equivalent to 180 degrees, we
can see that one radian must equal 180/p 5 57.296 degrees (to 5
significant figures).

2.3.3.2 Angle Measure in S.I. Units
Since radians are defined in terms of the ratio of two lengths, the
values associated with an angle carry no units and are said to be
dimensionless. Similarly, the degree measure of angle is also
dimensionless. We can reinforce this by remembering that the sine or
cosine of an angle, whether measured in degrees or radians, is defined
as the ratio of the lengths of two sides of a triangle. However, in order
to indicate which form of angle measure is in use, it is common practice
to attach the S.I. symbol ‘rad’ (as a quasi unit), or to place a small circle
as a superscript to indicate degrees (u). For example, we have h 5p / 2
rad or h 5 90u or, equivalently, h / rad 5p/2 or h/u 5 90.
2.3.3.3 Sign Conventions for Angles and Trigonometric Functions
The geometric definition given above for the trigonometric functions
in terms of the ratio of the sides of a right-angled triangle, restricts the
angles to values in the range 0u to 90u or, alternatively, to:
0ƒhƒ p
2 rad:
The definition of angle may be broadened, however, by considering
the location of a point (x, y) on the circumference of a circle, with
centre at the origin of a Cartesian xy-coordinate system (sometimes
referred to as a rectangular coordinate system) (see Figure 2.15). The
Figure 2.15

placed on a Cartesian coordinate
system.
Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use
57

line joining the point on the circle to the origin is of length r, and
equal to the radius of the circle.
A zero value for the angle corresponds to the point lying on the
positive x-axis. The angle increases in a positive sense as the point
circulates in an anti-clockwise direction; circulation in a clockwise
sense is indicated by a negative value of h. Thus, for example,
h~{p=4 is equivalent to h~7p=4 (see Figure 2.16).
We can now redefine the trigonometric functions in terms of the
radius r, and the co-ordinates x and y, of a point on the circle:
sin h~ y
r , cos h~ x
r , and tan h~ y
x
ð2:22Þ
These definitions are not in conflict with those given earlier, but now
allow for all angles; for example, angles lying in the range 90u , h ,
180u correspond to negative values for x and positive values for y,
whereas those in the range 270u , h , 360u correspond to positive
values for x and negative values for y. We can also see how the signs
of the values of the trigonometric functions depend upon which of the
four quadrants of the circle the point lies in (see Figure 2.15 and
Table 2.4). For example, in quadrant II, where 90u , h , 180u, and
Figure 2.16
Positive values for
angle are generated by rotation in
an anti-clockwise sense, whereas
negative values imply clockwise
rotation.

2.3.3.4 Special Values for Trigonometric Functions
There are only a few special cases where trigonometric functions have
exact values, all of which are obtained easily without reference to
tables or resorting to the use of a calculator. For example, sin(p/4) is
calculated from the definition of the sine function and use of
Pythagoras’ Theorem. An angle of h 5 p / 4 (or h 5 45u), requires the
magnitudes of x and y to be equal, which implies the length of the
hypotenuse (given by r) to be a factor of
ﬃﬃﬃ

larger than either x or y.
Thus, if sin h 5 y / r, then sin p=4

special values for the sine, cosine and tangent functions.
Problem 2.7
(a) Given that the PH2 radical has a ‘V’ shape, with an H^PH
angle of 123u, and a P–H bond length of 140 pm in its ground
state, calculate the H–H distance.
(b) Given that the bond angle and P–H bond length change to
107u and 102 pm, respectively, in the first electronic excited
state, calculate the change in the H–H distance.
Hint: you may find it helpful to draw an isosceles triangle, and
drop a perpendicular from the P atom to the line joining the two
hydrogen atoms.
Pythagoras’ Theorem states that
for a right-angled triangle, the
square of the length of the hypo-
tenuse is equal to the sum of the
squares of the lengths of the
remaining two sides. Using
Figure 2.13 for reference, we can
write this more succinctly as
AB25AC2+BC2.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle
with at least two sides of equal
length and with two equal angles.
The name derives from the Greek
iso (same) and skelos (leg). A
triangle having all sides of equal
length is called an equilateral
triangle, but because it has two
sides of equal length is also a
special case of an isosceles
triangle. A triangle with no equal
length sides is called a scalene
triangle.

2.3.3.6 Domains and Periodic Nature of Trigonometric Functions
Thus far we have considered angles ranging from 0 to 2p (0 to 360u),
but we can further extend this range by allowing additional complete
rotations about the origin. Each additional rotation, anti-clockwise or
clockwise, adds or subtracts 2p to or from the angle, with the value of
the sine and cosine trigonometric functions simply repeating with
each full rotation. The tangent function repeats every half rotation.
Thus, for the angles h ¡ 2np, where n 5 0, 1, 2, 3, ….

Þ~ sin h and cos h+2np
ð
Þ~ cos h
ð2:24Þ
and for the angles h ¡ np:
tan h+np
ð
Þ~ tan h:
ð2:25Þ
Plots of the three trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 2.17.
Functions having a property f(x ¡ a) 5 f(x) are known as periodic
functions with a period a, and are said to be many-to-one functions. In
the examples given above, the period for the sine and cosine functions
is 2p, whereas that for the tangent function is p.
We can see from Table 2.5 and Figure 2.17 that the sine and cosine
functions both have as domain the set of real numbers. The domains
of the tangent and reciprocal trigonometric functions are different,
however, because we must exclude values of h for which the
denominator of the defining formula is zero. Thus, for example,
since cos h 5 0 for h 5 (2n 2 1)p / 2, where n is any integer (including
zero), the domains for the secant (sec) and tangent (tan) functions
consist of the set of real numbers, with the exclusion of h 5 (2n 2 1)p / 2
with n defined as above. For the tan and sec functions, the lines
at h 5 (2n 2 1)p / 2 are known as vertical asymptotes because the
curves of the respective functions approach these lines without ever
crossing them (see Figure 2.17). In some situations it is necessary
to limit the domains so that the functions are so called 1:1 functions
(as opposed to many-to-one). The principal branches for the sine, cosine
Many-to-one functions are those
for which more than one value of
x is associated with one value of
f(x): thus, for f(x)5x2, the num-
bers ¡2 are both associated with
the number 4, and so this function
is 2:1.

2.3.4.1 Symmetric and Antisymmetric Functions
Functions having the property f(2x) 5 f(x) are called symmetric, or

called antisymmetric or odd functions. In our discussion of trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions, we have encountered a number of
examples of functions that fall into one or other of these categories, as
well as some that fall into neither. Symmetric and antisymmetric
functions are so called because they are symmetric or antisymmetric
with respect to reflection in the y-axis. If we look closely at
Figure 2.17 we see that, since cosh 5 cos(2h), and sinh 5 2sin(2h),
the cos and sin functions are symmetric and antisymmetric,
respectively. Likewise, we can classify the cosh and sinh functions
as symmetric and antisymmetric, respectively (see Figure 2.18). The
exponential functions displayed in Figure 2.18 above are neither
symmetric nor antisymmetric. In Chapter 6 we shall meet these ideas
again, when we consider the integration of functions having well-
defined symmetry: a feature that has important applications in
quantum mechanics, where we consider the physical significance of
whether certain integrals involving wave functions of atoms and
molecules are zero or non-zero.

2.3.4.2 The Product Function x2e2x
The function y5x2e2x is a product of two functions, x2 and e2x; the
former increases rapidly with increasing x, but the latter decreases
even more rapidly with increasing x. The result is that the value of the
product function, which is initially dominated by the quadratic term,
will quite rapidly be overcome by the exponential term as x increases.
In fact this is true regardless of the degree of the power term: it does
not matter whether we consider the function y 5 x2e2x or y 5 x20e2x
or y 5 x200e2x. Eventually, and for surprisingly small values of x, the
exponential term will always dominate. In fact even in the last
example, the function starts to become overwhelmed by the
exponential term around x 5 200. However, for increasingly negative
values of x, both terms in the product function are positive and
increasing, thus ensuring that the product function increases more
rapidly than either of its component terms. All of these features are
apparent in Figure 2.19.
2.3.4.3 Product of a Polynomial or Trigonometric Function with an
Exponential Function
The most common types of expression of this kind found in chemistry
typically have one of the following forms:
N Pn(x)e2x, where Pn(x) is a polynomial function of degree n,
N sin(nx)e2x.
Figure 2.19
Plots of the
functions y5x2, y5e2x, and the
product y5x2e2x.
Functions and Equations: Their Form and Use

Polynomial functions have the general form:
Pn x
ð Þ~c0zc1xzc2x2zc3x3z . . . zcnxn
ð2:43Þ
where c0, c1, …, cn, are constants and n is a positive integer, the largest
value of which defines the degree of the polynomial. Polynomial
functions of degree 3 or higher may display finite regions of
oscillation (see Figure 2.20); in contrast, trigonometric functions sin
and cos oscillate indefinitely (see Figure 2.17).
When we form a product of either a polynomial or a trigonometric
function with the exponential function y 5 e2x, the rapid decline in
value of the exponential function as x increases from zero results in a
rapid damping of the oscillation (see Figure 2.21):
In the case of polynomials of higher degree, a finite number of
oscillations occur before they become overwhelmed by the exponen-
tial function, whereas for the product of sine or cosine with an
exponential function, the number of oscillations is infinite, with their
amplitude decreasing with increasing positive x. For negative values
of x the opposite occurs, with the amplitude of the oscillations
increasing with increasingly negative values of x.
2.3.4.4 A Chemical Example: The 3s Atomic Radial Wave Function for

. This may look
rather complicated but it is in fact relatively straightforward in its
form, comprising a second degree polynomial function and an
exponential function, both of which are expressed as a function of the
independent variable, r (the distance of the electron from the nucleus).
In fact, wherever r appears in both parts of the product, it is divided
by a0, the Bohr radius, and we say in the case of the polynomial
function that it is second degree in r
a0
(the independent variable). A
plot of R3sa0
3=2 versus r
a0
is given in Figure 2.22. If we compare the
plot with the function displayed in Figure 2.19, it should be clear that
they both have essentially the same form. The main difference in the
case of the radial wave function is that we consider only values of r ¢ 0,

simply because negative values for the radial distance have no
physical meaning.
2.3.5 Explicit and Implicit Functions
Up to this point, we have met functions of the form y5f(x) in which
the independent variable appears on the right side and the dependent
variable appears on the left. In such cases, the association between
a given value of the independent variable and the value of the
dependent variable is explicit. For example, the function:
y~ex
is an example of one in which y is an explicit function of x. However,
we can always express such functions in the form f(x, y) 5 0 in which
y is an implicit function of x. For example, the function y 5 ex may be
presented in an implicit form as:
ln y{x~0:
In this example, the implicit form of the function may be rearranged
into a form in which either variable is an explicit function of the other.
However, sometimes we meet functions which are impossible to
arrange into an explicit form. The function:
yzey~x5
is an example of an implicit function for which there is one unique
value of y associated with each value of x but which cannot be
expressed in the form of an explicit relationship between y and x. It is
nevertheless possible in this case to compute each value of y

example from chemistry is the van der Waals eqn (2.6) in which both

However, it is most convenient to consider the molar volume Vm as an

2.4 Equations
Consider the plots of the quadratic polynomial functions y 5 x2 2 4x + 3,
y 5 x2 2 4x + 4, and y 5 x2 2 4x + 6 in Figure 2.23. Curve (a) cuts the
x-axis (y 5 0) at x 5 3 and x 5 1, values which correspond to the
two solutions (or roots) of the quadratic equation x2 2 4x + 3 5 0.
In this example, we can more easily obtain the two roots by factorising
the polynomial equation, rather than by plotting the function. Thus
x2 2 4x + 3 can be expressed as the product of two linear factors:
x2{4xz3~ x{3
ð
Þ x{1
ð
Þ,
and we can see that this will equal zero when either of the two linear
factors equals zero;
i:e: when x{3~0 [ x~3
or when x{1~0 [ x~1:
In cases where factorisation proves difficult, it is always possible to use
the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation, ax2 + bx + c 5 0:

The quantity b2 2 4ac is known as the discriminant, and its value can
be positive, zero or negative. In cases where it is positive, the equa-
tion has two real and different roots; if it is zero then the equation will
have two, identical roots, and, if it is negative, then there are no real
roots, as the formula involves the square root of a negative number, for
which there is no real result. A way around this latter difficulty is
described in Chapter 9, where complex numbers are introduced.
The value of the discriminant for the equation x2 2 4x + 3 5 0 is
positive, and we see that there are clearly two different roots, as
indicated in plot (a) (Figure 2.23), which shows the curve cutting the
x-axis at x 5 1 and x 5 3. The curve of the function y 5 x2 2 4x + 4,
shown in plot (b), touches the x-axis at x 5 2. In this case, the
discriminant is zero, and we have two equal roots, given by

axis in one place, the equation x2 2 4x + 4 5 0 still has two roots –

are no values of x corresponding to y 5 0, indicating that there are
no real roots of the quadratic equation x2 2 4x + 6 5 0, as the
discriminant is equal to –8.

2.4.1 An Algebraic Method for Finding Roots of Polynomial
Equations
For a given polynomial function y 5 f(x), one (or more) roots of the
polynomial equation f(x) 5 0 can often be found by an algebraic
method. Suppose the polynomial f(x) is of degree n. If x 5 l is a root
of the polynomial equation, then f(l) 5 0, and (x 2 l) is a factor of
the polynomial:
f x
ð Þ ~ x { l
ð
Þ c1xn{1 z c2xn{2 z . . . z cn


ð2:46Þ
The truth of the previous statement follows by substituting x 5 l into
the above equation, where we see that, irrespective of the value of the
second expression in parentheses, which is a polynomial of degree n 2 1,
the first term in parentheses is zero, thus implying that f(l) 5 0. If there
is a root with integer value, then it can sometimes be found by trial and
error, using l 5 ¡1, ¡2, … and the polynomial of degree n 2 1 can
then be treated in the same way. If no further roots can be found
algebraically at any stage in the iterative procedure, then the current
polynomial can be plotted to exhibit the existence, or otherwise, of
remaining roots. The key requirement is that, at each step, the

root. Once the polynomial of degree two is reached, it is easiest to use
the formula given in eqn (2.45) to test for the existence of a further two
or zero roots.

2.4.2 Solving Polynomial Equations in a Chemical Context
In practice, the solution of polynomial equations is problematic if no
simple roots are found by trial and error. In such circumstances the
graphical method may be used or, in the case of a quadratic or cubic
equation, there exist algebraic formulae for determining the roots.
Alternatively, computer algebra software (such as Maple or
Mathematica, for example) can be used to solve such equations
explicitly. In Worked Problem 2.7, we show how the calculation of the
pH of 1026 mol dm23 HCl (aq) requires the solution of a quadratic
equation.

Worked Problem 2.7
Q. Calculate the pH of 1026 mol dm23 HCl (aq), taking into
account the hydronium (H3O+) ions from:
(a) HCl alone;
(b) HCl and the dissociation of water (equilibrium
constant, Kw 5 10214).
A. (a) The simple formula pH 5 2log([H3O+] / mol dm23),
leads to a value for the pH of 6, since [H3O+] 5 1026 mol
dm23.
(b) As the concentration of HCl is so small, it is appropriate
to take account of the dissociation of water in our
calculation of the pH, and so we need to consider the
concentration of hydronium ions produced from two
sources, described by the following processes:
HCl z H2O ? H3Oz z Cl{ ;
2H2O '
Kw H3OzzOH{
Thus, if [H3O+] / mol dm–3 5 h, [Cl2] / mol dm–3 5 c, and
[OH2] / mol dm–3 5 b, then charge conservation requires:
h ~ c z b [ b ~ h { c:
where c 5 10–6. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of
water is given by Kw 5 hb, which we can now rewrite as:
Kw ~ hb ~ h h { c
ð
Þ ~ h2 { ch [ h2 { ch { Kw ~ 0 ð2:51Þ
Eqn (2.51) is a quadratic equation in h, and the two roots may
be found using eqn (2.45). Thus:

and, on substituting for c and Kw, we find h 5 1.099 6 1026 or
h 5 29.902 6 1029. The first solution yields pH 5 5.996; the
second solution, although mathematically required, does not
correspond to an acceptable physical result, as the logarithm of
a negative number is not defined as a real number and thus has
no physical significance.
Charge conservation requires
that there is the same number of
cations as anions in the solution.
Thus the sum of the concentra-
tions of the OH– and Cl– ions
must be the same as the hydro-
nium ion concentration and so
h 5 c + b.
The logarithm of a negative
number is a so-called complex
number which we discuss in

N Electronic structures, through the determination of molecular
orbitals, constructed as linear combinations of atomic orbitals
(LCAO); thus, for example, the determination of the simplest s-

the ground state), involves the use of the seven s atomic orbitals
1sH, 1sC, 1sN, 2sC, 2sN, 2psC and 2psN, and leads to the solution of
a polynomial equation of degree seven for the molecular orbital
energies.
N Characteristic frequencies of molecular vibrations: in the case of

We need to solve a cubic polynomial equation for the three values
of r=a0, and hence r, as a multiple of a0. Unlike the simple expressions
for the solutions of a quadratic equation given in eqn (2.45), and the
cubic equation in Worked Problem 2.6, a more involved algebraic
procedure is required to solve the cubic equation given in eqn (2.54).
However, we know that a hydrogen 4s atomic orbital has 3 radial
nodes (n 2 l 2 1), and since there are three roots to the third order
polynomial equation Rnl(r) 5 0, we conclude that all three roots are
real. In this case, therefore, the graphical method will give good
estimates for the location of the roots, which can then be improved by
trial and error; alternatively, computer algebra software can be used
to determine the roots to any sensible number of decimal places.

Limits
The concept of the limit is a fairly broad one, commonly used for
probing the behaviour of mathematical functions as the independent
variable approaches a particular value. This is particularly useful in
exploring errant or unexpected behaviour in a function as well as in
examining the behaviour of a function as the independent variable takes
on increasingly large or small positive or negative values. More import-
antly, limits are central to our understanding of differential calculus, as is
seen in the work of Fermat who, in the early 17th century, used the con-
cept of the limit for finding the slope of the tangent at a point on a curve
(a topic discussed in Chapter 4). Likewise, in Chapter 6, we shall see how
the concept of the limit provides a foundation for integral calculus.
Aims:
By the end of the chapter you should be able to:
N Understand the principles involved in defining the limit.
N Understand the notions of continuity and discontinuity.
N Use limits to examine the point behaviour of functions which
might display unexpected characteristics.
N Investigate asymptotic behaviour of functions as the inde-
pendent variable takes on increasingly large positive or
negative values.
N Use limits to improve your understanding of how physical
processes may change as experimental conditions change
from one extreme to another.
3.1 Mathematical and Chemical Examples
3.1.1 Point Discontinuities
The function shown in Figure 3.1 shows a break at x 5 3, where the
value of y is 0=0, and is therefore indeterminate. In this situation, the
function is said to exhibit a discontinuity at x 5 3, which means that it
81

is impossible to sketch the plot of the function by hand without taking
the pencil off the paper.
A chemical example is shown schematically in Figure 2.8, where
discontinuities are seen in the entropy function at the melting and
boiling points, Tm and Tb respectively, as well as at a temperature Ts
where a change in crystal structure occurs in the solid state. Although
the entropy function is undefined at these three transition tempera-
tures, the discontinuities are finite in nature, as the corresponding
changes in S are finite in size. We can see from this example that S is
continuous only over sub-intervals of the domain; furthermore at
each of the transition temperatures, Tm, Tb and Ts, the value of S is
ambiguous. This situation arises because two values of S result
depending on whether we approach a transition temperature from
higher or lower values of T.

interval 0¡x¡5.

82
Maths for Chemists

Sometimes we meet functions displaying an infinite discontinuity.
For example, the function y 5 f(x) 5 1 / (1 2 x), shown in Figure 3.2,
displays such a discontinuity at x 5 1 because, as we approach x51
from higher and lower values of x, the value of f(x) tends towards
infinitely large values in negative and positive senses, respectively.
In this example, the line x 5 1 is known as a vertical asymptote
(see Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 for further discussion of asymptotic
behaviour).
The tangent function, tan x 5 sin x / cos x, as shown in Figure 3.3,
is interesting because it exhibits infinite discontinuities whenever x
passes through an odd multiple of p
2 .
3.1.2 Limiting Behaviour for Increasingly Large Positive or Negative
Values of the Independent Variable
We now turn to examining the limiting behaviour of functions as the
independent variable takes on increasingly large positive or negative
values. As an illustration, consider the function shown in Figure 3.2.
We see from the form of f(x) that the value of y approaches zero as x
becomes increasingly large in both positive and negative senses: the
line y50 is an asymptote. In the former case, the values of y are
increasingly small negative numbers and in the latter, they are
increasingly small positive numbers. The limiting values of f(x)
are therefore zero in both cases.
Periodic functions such as sin x or cos x have no asymptotes (no
single limiting value), because their values oscillate between two limits
as the independent variable increases in a positive or negative sense:

y5tan x.

for example, the value of the function f(x) 5 cos(2x), oscillates
between +1 and 21 as xA ? (see Figure 3.4).
Problem 3.1
Find the limiting values for (a) x2e2x and (b) cos(2x)e2x as
xA?.
3.1.3 Limiting Behaviour for Increasingly Small Values of the
Independent Variable
Frequently, the context of a particular problem requires us to
consider the limiting behaviour of a function as the value of the
independent variable approaches zero. For example, consider the
physical measurement of heat capacity at absolute zero. Since it is
impossible to achieve absolute zero in the laboratory, a natural way to
approach the problem would be to obtain measurements of the
property at increasingly lower temperatures. If, as the temperature is
reduced, the corresponding measurements approach some value m,
then it may be assumed that the measurement of the property (in this
case, heat capacity) at absolute zero is also m, so long as the specific
heat function is continuous in the region of study. We say in this case
that the limiting value of the heat capacity, as the temperature
approaches absolute zero, is m. As we shall see in Section 3.2, the
notation we use to describe this behaviour is:
lim
T?0 CV T
ð Þ~m
ð3:1Þ
Figure 3.4

y 5 cos(2x).
84

where, in this case, m50, because the limiting value of the heat
capacity as T A 0 K is zero. It is also important to note that it is only
possible to approach absolute zero from positive values of T; thus, in
this situation, the ‘right’ limit, usually written as lim
T?0z CV T
ð Þ~m, is
the only one of physical significance.
Problem 3.2
Find the limiting values for (a) x2e2x and (b) cos(2x)e2x as
xA0.
3.2 Defining the Limiting Process
For a function of a single variable x, symbolised, as usual, by y 5 f(x),
we are interested in the value of f(x) as x approaches a particular
value, a, but never takes the value a. Points where the function is not
defined, as seen, for example at x 5 1 in Figure 3.2, are excluded from
the domain of the function; at other points, the function is
continuous.
Limits play an important role in probing the behaviour of a
function at any point in its domain, and the notation we use to
describe this process is:
lim
x?a f x
ð Þ~m
ð3:2Þ
Note: in this symbolism, the suffix to the symbol lim indicates that,
although x approaches a, it never actually takes the value a. For the
limit to exist, the same (finite) result must be obtained whether we
approach a from smaller or larger values of x. Furthermore, if m 5
f(a), then the function is said to be continuous at x 5 a.
3.2.1 Finding the Limit Intuitively
Consider the plot of the function:
y~f x
ð Þ, where f x
ð Þ~ x2{9
x{3
ð3:3Þ
shown in Figure 3.1. It is evident that f(x) is continuous (unbroken)
for all values of x except x 5 3. Since the denominator and numerator
of the function are both zero at x 5 3, we see that the function is
Limits
85

indeterminate at this value of x; however, as seen in Table 3.1, the
ratio of the numerator and denominator seems to be approaching the
value y 5 6 as x A 3 from smaller or larger values.
Taking even smaller increments either side of 3, say x 5 3 ¡
0.0001, we find that f(3.0001) 5 6.0001 and f(2.9999) 5 5.9999. These
results suggest that for smaller and smaller increments in x, either side
of x 5 3, the values of the function become closer and closer to 6.
Thus we say that, in the limit x A 3, m takes the value 6:
lim
x?3
x2{9
x{3 ~6
ð3:4Þ
3.2.2 An Algebraic Method for Evaluating Limits
In practice, it is often easiest when evaluating limits to write x 5 a ¡
d, and consider what happens as d A 0, but never takes the value zero.
This procedure allows us to let x become as close as we like to the
value a, without it taking the value x 5 a.

where, in the last step, d can be cancelled in every term of the
numerator and denominator as its value is never zero. Thus we
obtain the expected result that f(x) approaches the limiting
value of 6 as x tends to the value 3, irrespective of the sign of d.
In this situation, m in the definition of the limit has the value 6.

3.2.3 Evaluating Limits for Functions Whose Values Become
Indeterminate
Whenever the value of a function becomes indeterminate for
particular limiting values in the independent variable (for example,
division by zero or expressions such as ? / ? or ? 2 ?), we need to
adopt alternative strategies in determining the limiting behaviour.
Such situations arise quite commonly in chemistry, especially when we
are interested in evaluating some quantity as the independent variable

takes on increasingly large or small values. Good examples occur in
dealing with mathematical expressions arising in:
N Manipulating the solutions of rate equations in kinetics.
N Determining high or low temperature limits of thermodynamic
properties.
Worked Problem 3.2
Q: Find lim
x??
2x2z4
x2{xz1 :
A: Both the numerator and denominator tend to infinity as xA
?, but their ratio remains finite. There are two ways of
handling this situation:
First, we note that as x becomes very large, 2x2 + 4 is
increasingly well approximated by 2x2, and x2 2 x + 1 by x2 as,
in both expressions, the highest power of x dominates as x
becomes indefinitely large. Thus, as x increases without limit,
we find:
lim
x??
2x2z4
x2{xz1 ~ lim
x??
2x2
x2 ~ lim
x?? 2~2:
Second, we could divide the numerator and denominator by
the highest power of x, before taking the limit:
lim
x??
2x2z4
x2{xz1 ~ lim
x??
2z4=x2
1{1=xz1=x2 ~2,
and, again we see that as x increases without limit, the ratio of
numerator to denominator tends to 2.

The limiting behaviour of functions for increasingly small values of
the independent variable can be found in a similar way by applying
exactly the same principles, except that, now, the lowest power of x
provides the largest term in both numerator and denominator.

Q: Find lim

A: This time, for increasingly small values of x, the numerator

3.2.4 The Limiting Form of Functions of More Than One Variable
Sometimes, we are interested in how the form of a function might
change for limiting values in one or more variables. For example,
consider the catalytic conversion of sucrose into fructose and glucose
by the enzyme invertase (b-fructo-furanidase). The rate of formation
of product P for this reaction varies in a rather complicated way with
the sucrose concentration [S]. At low [S], the reaction is first order in
[S], and at high [S], it is zero order. The behaviour observed in
Figure 3.5 is established by investigating the form of the function
describing the rate of reaction for the two limiting cases where [S]
Figure 3.5

sucrose concentration, [S], where
the reaction is first and zero
order, respectively.
90

approaches either very large or very small values, rather than the
absolute value of the function as in the examples discussed above.
This is a consequence in this case of the rate equation being a function
of more than one variable.

Differentiation
A great deal of chemistry is concerned with processes in which
properties change as a function of some variable. Good examples are
found in the field of chemical kinetics, which is concerned with
measuring and interpreting changes in concentrations of reactants or
products with time, and in quantum mechanics, which describes how
wavefunctions associated with electronic, vibrational and rotational
degrees of freedom of an atom or molecule change as a function of
distance, length, angle or time.
Aims:
Calculus is of fundamental importance in chemistry because it
underpins so many key chemical concepts. In this chapter, we
discuss the foundations and applications of differential calculus;
by the end of the chapter you should be able to:
N Describe processes involving change in one independent
variable.
N Define the average rate of change of the dependent variable.
N Use the concepts of limits to define the instantaneous rate of
change.
N Differentiate most of the standard mathematical functions by
rule.
N Differentiate a sum, product or quotient of functions.
N Apply the chain rule to non-standard functions.
N Understand the significance of higher order derivatives and
identify maxima, minima and points of inflection.
N Understand the concept of the differential operator.
N Understand the basis of the eigenvalue problem and identify
eigenfunctions, eigenvalues and operators.
N Differentiate functions of more than one variable.
93

4.1 The Average Rate of Change
Consider the plot of the function y 5 f(x), in which x is the
independent variable, shown in Figure 4.1.
The average rate of change of f (x) over the increment Dx in x is
given by:
QR
PR ~ f x0zDx
ð
Þ{f x0
ð
Þ
Dx
~ Dy
Dx ,
ð4:1Þ
where f(x0) and f(x0 + Dx) are the values of f(x) at the points x0 and
x0 + Dx, and Dy is the change in y, that results in the change Dx in x.
This average rate of change corresponds to the slope of the chord
PQ; that is, the slope of the straight line (sometimes termed the
secant) joining P and Q. In chemical kinetics, we can draw a direct
analogy by equating the concentration of a species A at time t, often
designated by [A], to the dependent variable (designated as y in
Figure 4.1), and the time after initiation of the reaction, t, to the
independent variable (designated by x in Figure 4.1). Consequently, if
we measure the concentration of a reaction product at two intervals of
time, say 1 minute apart, we might conclude that over that interval,
the concentration of the product had changed by 1.00 mol dm23. In
this case, we could state that the average rate of reaction in this
interval is 1.00 mol dm23 per min. The problem here is that we know
nothing about how the reaction rate changes in detail during that
interval of 1 minute, and it is this detail that so crucial to our
understanding of the kinetics of the reaction. Consequently, what we
need, in general, is to be able to quantify the rate of change of the
dependent variable at a particular value of the independent variable,
rather than simply the average rate of change over some increment in
Figure 4.1
Defining the average
rate of change of f(x) as x is
incremented from x0 to x0+Dx.
94

the independent variable. This equates in our chemical analogy, to
being able to measure the instantaneous reaction rate at a given
instant in time (and consequently for a given concentration of
reactant or product), rather than the average rate of reaction over
some extended period of time. However, before we can determine
these instantaneous chemical rates, we must first establish some
mathematical principles.
4.2 The Instantaneous Rate of Change
4.2.1 Differentiation from First Principles
If we now reconsider the general situation shown in Figure 4.1, we
can determine the instantaneous rate of change by examining the
limiting behaviour of the ratio, QR / PR, the change in y divided by
the change in x, as Dx tends to zero:

The limiting value defined in eqn (4.2) exists if:
N The function does not undergo any abrupt changes at x0 (it is
continuous at the point x0).
N It is independent of the direction in which the point x0 is
approached.
If the limit in eqn (4.2) exists, it is called the derivative of the
function y 5 f(x) at the point x0. The value of the derivative varies
with the choice of x0, and we define it in general terms as:
dy

is the name given to the value of the derivative at the
point x0. The derivative of the function y 5 f(x) at x 5 x0 in
Figure 4.1 corresponds geometrically to the slope of the tangent to
the curve y 5 f(x) at the point P (known as the gradient).
The basic formula in eqn (4.3) for the derivative is often given in the
form:

We should also note that:
N
dy
dx
is the name of the derivative function, commonly also
represented as f9(x).
N The domain of the derivative function is not necessarily the same as
that of y 5 f(x) (see Table 4.1).
The requirement that, for the limit in eqn (4.2) to exist, the function
does not undergo any abrupt changes is sometimes overlooked, yet it
is an important one. An example of a function falling into this
category is the modulus function, y 5 |x|, defined by:
y~f x
ð Þ~ x
j j~
x if x¢0
{x if xv0

:
This function is continuous for all values of x [Figure 4.2 (a)], but
there is no unique slope at the point x 5 0 as the derivative is
undefined at this point [Figure 4.2(b)].
Chemical examples showing this type of behaviour include pro-
cesses associated with sudden changes in concentration, phase, crystal
structure, temperature, etc. For example, Figure 2.9 shows how the
equilibrium concentration of a chemical species changes suddenly

discontinuities in this function, its derivative is undefined at time t0.

4.2.2 Differentiation by Rule
4.2.2.1 Some Standard Derivatives
The derivatives of all functions can be found using the limit method
described in Section 4.2.1. Some of the more common functions, and
their derivatives, are listed in Table 4.1. Unless otherwise indicated,
the respective domains (Dom) are ‘all values of x’.
However, as we have seen above, and in Table 4.1, we do meet
functions for which the derivative f9(x) does not exist at selected
values of x. The functions y 5 f(x) 5 ln x at x 5 0 and y 5 f(x) 5 tan x
at x 5 (2n + 1)p / 2, both listed in Table 4.1, fall into this category.
Naturally, since the derivative does not exist in these cases at selective
values of x, the domain of the derivatives of these functions will not
be the same as the original functions. The restrictions on the
respective domains are best seen in sample plots of these functions
shown in Figure 4.3.
4.2.2.2 An Introduction to the Concept of the Operator
The notation dy
dx (or sometimes dy / dx) for the derivative is just one
of a number of different notations in widespread use, all of which are
equivalent:
dy
dx , dy=dx, f ’ x
ð Þ, f 1
ð Þ x
ð Þ, ^Df x
ð Þ
The more commonly used notations are dy
dx and f9(x), but expressing
the derivative in the form ^Df x
ð Þ provides a useful reminder that the

In general, an operator, ^A, is represented by a symbol with a caret
(‘hat’) denoting an instruction to undertake an appropriate action on
the object to its right [here f(x)]. In eqn (4.5), we consider dy
dx to be the
differentiation operator d

4.2.3 Basic Rules for Differentiation
Although all functions can be differentiated from first principles using
eqn (4.4), this can be a rather long-winded process in practice. In this
chapter, we deal with the differentiation of more complicated
functions with the aid of a set of rules, all of which may be derived
from the defining relation (4.4). In many cases, however, we simply
need to learn what the derivative of a particular function is, or how to
go about differentiating a certain class of function. For example, we
learn that the derivative of y 5 f(x) 5 sin x is cos x, but that the
derivative of y 5 f(x) 5 cos x is 2sin x. Similarly we can differentiate
any function of the type y 5 f(x) 5 xn by remembering the rule that
we reduce the index of x by 1, and multiply the result by n; that is
d
dx xn~nxn{1 n=0

4.2.4 Chain Rule
Quite frequently we are faced with the problem of differentiating
functions of functions, such as y 5 ln(x2 + x +1). The derivative of this
function is not immediately obvious, and so we use a strategy known
as the chain rule to reduce the problem to a more manageable form.
We can proceed as follows:
N Introduce a new variable u 5 x2 + x + 1 to transform the function
y 5 ln(x2 + x + 1) into the simpler form y 5 ln u.
N Determine the derivative of y with respect to u:

4.3 Higher Order Derivatives
In general, when we differentiate a function y 5 f (x) another function
of x is obtained:
dy
dx ~f ’ x
ð Þ
If this derivative function is specified, say, by the relation
h 5 f9(x) 5 g(x), then, so long as g(x) is not zero, h may be
differentiated again to yield the second derivative of f (x):
dh
dx ~ d
dx h~ d
dx
dy
dx ~ d2y
dx2 :f ’’ x
ð Þ or f 2
ð Þ x
ð Þ
ð4:11Þ
This process may usually be repeated to determine higher order
derivatives, if they exist. Thus, for example, if f(x) 5 x3 2x + 1, then:
dy
dx ~3x2{1; d2y
dx2 ~6x; d3y
dx3 ~6, and dny
dxn ~0 for nw 3:
When we write h5f9(x)5g(x), we
are simply labelling the function
g(x) that results from differentia-
tion of f(x) arbitrarily with the letter
h in the same way that we
labelled f(x) with y.

In this example, we can see that each act of differentiation
decreases the index of (1 + x) by one and so it follows that the
fifth derivative will be zero.
We can gain some useful insight into what exactly the first and second
derivatives of a function tell us by looking at the form of the three
functions f(x), f9(x) and f 0(x), as shown in Figure 4.4.

f(x)5(1+x)4 and its first two

Differentiation
103

The original function y 5 f(x) 5 (1 + x)4 must be positive for all
values of x and has a minimum value of zero at x 5 21. The first
derivative f9(x) 5 4(1 + x)3 gives us the rate of change (slope of the
tangent) of the function f(x) for any value of x. For x , 21, the value
of f9(x) 5 4(1 + x)3 is negative, which means the slope of the original
function is also negative (which we can see for ourselves by inspection
of the plot). For x . 21, the first derivative is positive and so the
slope of the original function is also positive. The fact that the value
of f9(x) 5 4(1 + x)3 is zero at x 5 21 indicates that the slope of the
function is zero at this point. Such a point is identified as a stationary
point, which, in this case, corresponds to a minimum (as we can see
from the plot). We shall see later in Section 4.4 how to prove whether
a stationary point is a maximum or minimum (or point of inflection)
without needing to plot the function. Similarly, the form of the second
derivative, f 0(x) 5 12(1 + x)2, gives us the slope, or rate of change, of
the first derivative and by extension the slope of the slope of the
original function f(x). The form of the second derivative provides us
with the means to characterise the nature of any stationary points in
the original function, whereas that of the first derivative tells us if and
where the stationary points exist (see Section 4.4).

4.3.1.1 The Eigenvalue Problem
A problem common to many areas in physical chemistry is the
following: given an operator, Aˆ, find a function w(x), and a constant
a, such that Aˆ acting on w(x) yields a constant multiplied by w(x). In
other words, the result of operating on the function w(x) by Aˆ is
simply to return w(x), multiplied by a constant factor, a. This type of
problem is known as an eigenvalue problem, and the key features may
be described schematically as follows:

In this example, we see that by differentiating the function
f(x) 5 cos kx twice, we regenerate our original function
multiplied by a constant which, in this case, is 2k2. Hence, cos
kx is an eigenfunction of Aˆ, and its eigenvalue is 2k2.
The key eigenvalue equation in
chemistry is the Schro¨ dinger
equation, Hˆ y5Ey. The solution
of this equation for a particular
system (such as an electron
bound by the field of a nucleus)
yields so-called wavefunctions, y,
that completely describe the sys-
tem of interest and from which
any property of the system can be
extracted.

4.4 Maxima, Minima and Points of Inflection
We often encounter situations in the physical sciences where we need
to establish at which value(s) of an independent variable a maximum
or minimum value in the function occurs. For example:
N The probability of finding the electron in the ground state of the
hydrogen atom between radii r and r + dr is given by D(r)dr, where
D(r) is the radial probability density function shown in Figure 4.5.
The most probable distance of the electron from the nucleus is
found by locating the maximum D(r) (see Problem 4.12 below). It
should come as no surprise to discover that this maximum occurs at
the value r 5 a0, the Bohr radius.
N When we attempt to fit a theoretical curve to a set of experimental
data points, we typically apply a least squares fitting technique
which seeks to minimise the deviation of the fit from the
experimental data. In this case, differential calculus is used to find
the minimum in the function that describes the deviation between
fit and experiment (see Chapter 13) .

4.4.1 Finding and Defining Stationary Points
Consider the function y 5 f (x) in Figure 4.6. As we saw in our
discussion of Worked Problem 4.3, values of x for which f9(x) 5 0 are
called stationary points. A stationary point may be:
N A maximum (point E, a turning point) or a minimum (point C, also
a turning point). The value of dy/dx changes sign on passing
through these points.
N A point of inflection: the tangent cuts the curve at this point (points
A, B and D).
4.4.1.1 Turning Points (Maxima and Minima)
E and C are called turning points because, in passing through E and C,
the value of dy=dx changes sign. The existence and nature of
stationary points, which are also turning points, may be identified
through the first and second derivatives of the function. If we consider
point C, we see that as we pass through this point the gradient
becomes less negative as we approach C, passes through zero at point
C, and then becomes positive. Clearly the rate of change of the
gradient is positive at point C (because the gradient changes from
negative to positive), which suggests that the function has a minimum
at this point:
A minimum exists if f 9(x) 5 0 and f (2)(x) . 0.
Similarly, on passing through point E, the gradient becomes less
positive, passes through zero at E and then becomes negative. In this
Figure 4.6
A plot of the function
y 5 f (x). Points A, C and E are all
stationary points, for which f 9(x)
5 0, while points C and E are also
turning points (minimum and
maximum, respectively). Points
A, B and D are all points of
inflection, but B and D are neither
stationary points nor turning
points. Note that at the points
of inflection, the tangents
(2 2 2 2) cut the curve.
108
Maths for Chemists

case, the rate of change in the gradient is negative and we can identify
point E as a maximum:
A maximum exists if f 9(x) 5 0 and f (2)(x) , 0.
In general y 5 f (x) will display a number of turning points within the
domain of the function.
Turning points corresponding to maxima and minima may be
classified as either:
N A global maximum or minimum which has a value greater or
smaller than all other points within the domain of the function.
N A local maximum or minimum which has a value greater or smaller
than all neighbouring points.
4.4.1.2 Points of Inflection
At a point of inflection (A, B or D), which may or may not be a
stationary point:
N The tangent cuts the curve.
N The slope of the tangent does not change sign.
Note that A is both a point of inflection and a stationary point, but
while B and D are both points of inflection, they are not stationary
points because f 9(x) ? 0.
Points of inflection occur when the gradient is a maximum
or minimum. This requires that f (2)(x) 5 0 but this in itself is not
sufficient to characterise a point of inflection. We achieve this through
the first non-zero higher derivative.
If f 9(x) 5 0, f (2)(x) 5 0 but f (3)(x) ? 0, then we have a point of
inflection which is also a stationary point (such as point A). However,
if f 9(x) ? 0, f (2)(x) 5 0 and f (3)(x) ? 0, then we have a point of
inflection which is not a stationary point (B or D). The rules for
identifying the location and nature of stationary points, turning
points and points of inflection are summarised in Table 4.2.
Interestingly, in the last row of Table 4.2 we see that a turning point
may exist for which f (2)(x) 5 0. In such cases, f (3)(x) 5 0 and the
nature of the turning point is determined by the sign of the fourth
derivative. An example of a function for which this latter condition
applies is y 5 f(x) 5 (x 21)4. If there is any doubt over the nature of a
stationary point, especially if the second derivative vanishes, it is
always helpful to sketch the function!

4.5 The Differentiation of Functions of Two or More
Variables
In chemistry we frequently meet functions of two or more variables.
For example:
N The pressure (P) of an ideal gas depends upon the two independent
variables, temperature (T) and volume (V):
P~ nRT
V
N The electron probability density function, r(x, y, z) for a molecule
depends upon three spatial coordinates (x, y, z) to specify its value
at a chosen position.
N The entropy, S, for a system containing three species A, B and AB at a
given temperature and pressure depends upon five variables: NA, NB,
NAB, T and P, where NX is the number of moles of A, B or AB.
Figure 4.8
The ideal gas
equation P~ nRT
V
shows that (a)
P varies linearly with T at
constant volume but (b) in a
non-linear way with V at constant
temperature.
112
Maths for Chemists

When we explore the nature and form of these and other multi-
variable functions, we need to know how to locate specific features, such
as maximum or minimum values. Clearly, functions of two variables,
such as in the ideal gas equation above, require plots in three
dimensions to display all their features (such plots appear as surfaces).
Derivatives of such functions with respect to one of these (independent)
variables are easily found by treating all the other variables as constants
and finding the partial derivative with respect to the single variable of
interest. For example, we can see from the ideal gas equation:
P~ nRT
V
that P varies linearly with T but in a non-linear way with V, as shown in
Figure 4.8.
If we were to differentiate this expression with respect to T and V,
we would be able to evaluate precisely the rate at which P varied
with respect to T (constant), or, with respect to V (variable) (see
Problem 4.13).
Worked Problem 4.6
Q. For the function z 5 xy + y2 find:
(a) The partial derivative of z with respect to x.
(b) The partial derivative of z with respect to y.

y
which means differentiation with respect to x, keeping y
constant. We often drop the y suffix and the brackets
because there is usually no problem in recognising which
variables are held constant. In this case, the y2 term is a
constant and will vanish and so the derivative is given by:
Lz

of change. This is especially important to our understanding of
chemical kinetics and other areas of chemistry, such as
thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. This

to another. The key points discussed include:

Differentials
In many areas of chemistry (e.g. error analysis; thermodynamics, etc.)
we are concerned with the consequences of small (and, sometimes, not
so small) changes in a number of variables and their overall effect
upon a property depending on these variables. For example, in
thermodynamics, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium
constant, K, is usually expressed in the form:
K~e{DGo{=RT,
where the change in Gibbs energy, DG o{~DH o{{TDS o{, itself depends
upon temperature, both explicitly through the presence of T, and
implicitly, as the changes in DH o{ and DS o{ are, in general, both
temperature-dependent. However, if we assume that DH o{ and DS o{
are, to a good approximation, independent of temperature, then for
small changes in temperature, we obtain the explicit formula relating K
and T:
K~e{ DHo{TDSo{
ð
Þ=RT~e{ DHo{=T{DSo{
ð
Þ=R
ð5:1Þ
Quite frequently, we are interested in the effect of small changes
in the temperature on the equilibrium constant. We could, of course,
use eqn (5.1) to calculate K at two different temperatures for any
reaction which satisfies the requirements given above and determine
the change in K by subtraction. However, in practice, a much more
convenient route makes use of the properties of differentials.
This Chapter is concerned with exploring what effect small changes
in one or more independent variables have on the dependent
variable in expressions such as eqn (5.1). We shall see that this is
particularly useful in determining how errors propagate through
expressions relating one property to another. However, before
discussing further the importance of differentials in a chemical
context, we need to discuss some of the background to the method of
differentials.

Aims:
By the end of this chapter you should be able to:
N Understand the definition of change defined by the differ-
ential and the concept of infinitesimal change.
N Understand the difference between the differential dy
representing an approximate change in the dependent
variable resulting from a small change in the independent
variable, and the actual change in the dependent variable, Dy.
N Calculate the differentials and the errors in approximating
the differential to the actual change in a dependent variable.
N Define the differential of a function of more than one
variable.
N Use differentials to calculate relative and percentage errors in
one property deriving from those in other properties.
5.1 The Effects of Incremental Change
We recall from Chapter 4 (Figure 4.1) that if Dy is the change in y that
accompanies an incremental change Dx in x, then:
Dy~f xzDx
ð
Þ{f x
ð Þ
ð5:2Þ
For example, if we consider the function y 5 f(x) 5 x3, the
incremental change in y that accompanies a change in Dx in x is given
as:
Dy~ xzDx
ð
Þ3{x3
which, on expanding, yields:
Dy~3x2Dxz3x Dx
ð
Þ2z Dx
ð
Þ3:
For sufficiently small values of Dx, the power terms in Dx decrease
very rapidly in magnitude. Thus, for example, if Dx 5 1022, then
Dx2 5 1024 and Dx3 5 1026. This may be expressed algebraically as:
Dx
ð
Þ3% Dx
ð
Þ2%Dx,
and, if we neglect Dx raised to power 2 or higher, we can approximate
the expression for Dy by:

The appearance of 3x2 in this expression is no accident. If we rewrite
the expression for Dy as:
Dy~ f xzDx
ð
Þ{f x
ð Þ

|Dx,
ð5:3Þ
then it is clear that, for a very small Dx, the term in parentheses is an
approximation for the derivative of f(x), which, for the present choice
of function, is 3x2. We can therefore rewrite the general result in the
form Dy # f9(x)Dx.
5.1.1 The Concept of Infinitesimal Change
An infinitesimal change in x, known as the differential dx, gives rise to
a corresponding change in y that is well represented by the differential
dy:
dy~f ’ x
ð Þdx:
ð5:4Þ
We can see from the defining eqn (5.4), and from Figure 5.1, that
f9(x) is the slope of the tangent to the curve y 5 f(x) at the point P.
We can also see that dy represents the change in the dependent
variable y that results from a change, Dx, in x, as we move along the
tangent to the curve at point P. It is important to stress that, although
dy is not the same as Dy, for small enough changes in x it is reasonable
to assume that the two are equivalent. Consequently, the difference
between Dy and dy is simply the error in approximating Dy to dy.
However, the same is not true of the differential dx, because at all
times, Dx 5 dx.
5.1.1.1 The Origins of the Infinitesimal
The concept of the infinitesimal first arose in 1630 in Fermat’s
‘Method of Finding Maxima & Minima’. This work marks the
beginning of differential calculus. The ideas introduced by Fermat
lead to speculation about how we can evaluate ‘just’ before or ‘just’
after. In the 17th century, the infinitesimal was known as the
‘disappearing’ and tangents as ‘touchings’. Leibniz thought infinite-
simals ‘‘well-founded fictions’’, whereas the philosopher Berkeley
attacked differentials as ‘‘neither finite quantities, not quantities
infinitely small, not yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of
departed quantities?’’. Newton described them as ‘‘quantities which
The concept of an infinitesimal
change is not soundly based
mathematically: we interpret such
changes as being very very small
(non-zero) increments in the
specified variable.

diminish not to the point where they have disappeared, nor to the point
before, but to the point where they are disappearing’’. Today, Borowski
and Borwein in their Dictionary of Mathematics1 regard an
infinitesimal as ‘‘a paradoxical conception … largely abandoned in
favour of the EPSILON-DELTA treatment of limits, … but made their
reappearance in the formulation of hyper-real numbers’’. Whether
or not you believe in their existence, they are clearly capable of
producing extraordinary results!
5.1.2 Differentials in Action
The use of the differential is important in the physical sciences
because fundamental theorems are sometimes expressed in differential
form. In chemistry, the laws of thermodynamics are nearly always
expressed in terms of differentials. For example, it is common to work
with the following formula as a means of expressing how the molar
specific heat capacity at constant pressure, CP, of a substance varies,

ð5:5Þ
The optimum values of the parameters a, b and c are found by fitting
measured values of CP over a range of temperatures to eqn (5.5).
Thus, if we know the value of CP at one temperature we can evaluate
it at another temperature, and thereby determine the effect of that
incremental (or decremental) change in temperature, DT, upon CP,
given by DCP. Alternatively, we can use the properties of differentials
given in eqn (5.4) to evaluate the differential of CP, dCP, in terms of
the differential dT as:
dCP~g’ T
ð ÞdT~ bz2cT
ð
Þ|dT
ð5:6Þ
For small enough changes in T, it is reasonable to make the
approximation that the differential dCP is equivalent to the actual
change DCP, and we can use the expression above as a simple one-step
route to evaluating the effect of small changes in T upon CP.

5.2 The Differential of a Function of Two or More
Variables
We have seen in eqn (5.4) that the differentials dy and dx are related
through the derivative dy 5 f9(x)dx which we can rewrite as:
dy~ dy
dx dx:
ð5:7Þ
We can now extend this principle to define differentials for functions
of two or more variables. If z 5 f (x, t) is a general function of two
independent variables x and t, then there are two contributions to the
differential dz: one from the change in x and the other from the
change in t:
120

dz~ Lz
Lx dxz Lz
Lt dt
ð5:8Þ
This result extends readily to functions of n independent variables
x1, x2, x3, …, xn. Thus, if z 5 f(x1, x2 x3, … xn), the differential of z is
built up from contributions associated with each independent
variable, as a straightforward generalisation of the result for two
independent variables:

Examples of functions of two or more variables expressed in
differential form are common in thermodynamics: for example, the
equation:
dG~dH{TdS
relates the consequence of very small changes in the enthalpy, H, and
entropy, S, on the Gibbs energy, G (here G is the dependent variable,
and H and S are the independent variables). As we shall see below, the
use of differentials helps us to study such effects, if the changes are
small. However, for large changes in the defining variables, we have to
evaluate the overall change in the property with the aid of integral
calculus, which we meet in Chapters 6 and 7.

Comment on the relative magnitudes of the two
contributions to dU.
5.3 The Propagation of Errors
In many chemical situations we deduce a value for a property of interest
by placing experimentally measured values in the right-hand side of an
appropriate formula. For example, if we use the ideal gas equation:
P~n RT
V
ð5:10Þ
to calculate the pressure, P, from a knowledge of volume, temperature,
amount of substance, and the gas constant, R, we might wish to know
how the errors in the measured property values (n, T and V) propagate
through to errors in the calculation of the pressure, P. If, for simplicity,
we assume that n and R are fixed (given) constants, how can we estimate
the error, dP, in P that results from errors, dT and dV, in the
measurement of T and V, respectively? The answer lies in adapting
eqn (5.8) to obtain dP in terms of dV and dT:
dP~ Lp
LT dTz Lp
LV dV
ð5:11Þ
122
Maths for Chemists

If dV and dT are the estimated errors in the measured values of V and
T, then we need to know the two partial derivatives, so that we can
estimate the error dP in P. However, in this and other instances, the
differentials themselves do not provide realistic measure of the errors.
For example, an absolute error of 10 cm in a measured length is
insignificant if we are talking about the shortest distance from Berlin to
Moscow, but highly significant if a furniture van driver has enough
clearance to pass under a low bridge in a country lane. For this reason,
the relative error, or the closely related percentage error, give much more
useful measures of error than absolute errors. Thus, in the context of the
ideal gas example, the two kinds of error are defined as follows:
N The relative error in P is given by dP
P .
N The percentage error in P is given by dP
P |100.
Propagation of errors will be explored in more detail in Chapter 13.
In particular, we will see that the approach described above, in which
the relationship involves more than one independent variable,
actually provides an upper limit to the absolute and relative errors.
This method is really best used where the errors in the different
independent variables are correlated: i.e. all contribute in the same
direction in a positive or negative sense.

Integration
In the earlier chapters on arithmetic, algebra and functions, we saw
examples of actions for which there was another action available to
reverse the first action; such a reversing action is called an inverse.
Some examples of mathematical actions and their inverses are listed in
Table 6.1:
The final example listed above proposes that the inverse to the
operation of differentiation is known as integration. The field of
mathematics which deals with integration is known as integral
calculus and, in common with differential calculus, plays a vital role
in underpinning many key areas of chemistry.
Aims:
In this chapter we define and discuss integration from two
perspectives: one in which integration acts as the inverse, or
reverse, of differentiation and the other in which integration
provides a means to finding the area under a curve. By the end
of the chapter, you should be able to:
N Understand the concept of integration as the reverse of
differentiation.
N Find the indefinite integral of a number of simple functions
from first principles.
N Integrate standard functions by rule.
A differentiation/integration cycle
involving a chosen initial function
will lead to the appearance of an
unspecified constant, C (as we
shall see later on).

6.1 Reversing the Effects of Differentiation
Integration is used frequently in kinetics, thermodynamics, quantum
mechanics and other areas of chemistry, in which we work with models
that deal with changing quantities. Thus, if we know the rate of change
of a property, y (the dependent variable), with respect to x (the
independent variable), in the form of dy=dx, then integral calculus
provides us with the tools for obtaining the form of y as a function of x.
We see that integration reverses the effects of differentiation.
Consider, for example, a car undergoing a journey with an initial
speed, u, and moving with a constant acceleration, a. The distance, s,
travelled after time t is given by:

Differentiating eqn. 6.1 gives the rate of change of distance with time,
or speed, v, at time, t:

However, the reverse process, in going from speed to distance involves
integration of the rate equation (eqn 6.2). In chemistry, the concept of
rate is central to an understanding of chemical kinetics, in which we
have to deal with analogous rate equations which typically involve the
rate of change of concentration, rather than the rate of change of
distance. For example, in a first order chemical reaction, in which the
rate of loss of the reactant is proportional to the concentration of the
reactant, the rate equation takes the form:
{ d A
½ 
dt ~k A
½ ,
ð6:3Þ
where k, the constant of proportionality, is defined as the rate
constant. The concentration of the reactant at a given time is found by
integrating the rate eqn (6.3), and the relationship between the

6.2 The Definite Integral
6.2.1 Finding the Area Under a Curve - The Origin of Integral Calculus
The concept of integration emerges when we attempt to determine the
area bounded by a plot of a function f(x) [where f(x) . 0] and the x
axis, within an interval x 5 a to x 5 b (written alternatively as [a, b]).
Clearly, if the plot gives a straight line, such as for the functions y 5 4
or y 5 2x + 3, as shown in Figure 6.1, then measuring the area is
straightforward, as the two areas are rectangular and trapezoidal in
shape, respectively. However, for areas bounded by a curve and three
straight lines, the problem is more difficult. The three situations are
shown in Figure 6.1.
The solution to the general problem of determining the area under
a curve arises directly from differential calculus, the concept of limits,
and the infinitesimal. Seventeenth century mathematicians began to
think of the area, not as a whole, but as made up of a series of
rectangles, of width Dx, placed side by side, and which together cover
the interval [a, b] (see Figure 6.2).
With this construction, there are two ways of estimating the area
under the curve: first, the interval [a, b] is divided into n sub-intervals
of width Dx 5 (b 2 a) / n. The area of each rectangle is obtained by
multiplying its width, Dx , by its height on the left-hand vertical side,
as shown in Figure 6.3(a).
In this case, the total area is given by:

is straightforward but, in (c),
where the plot is a curve, we need
to make use of the definite
integral.

The two estimates we obtain for the area will be different, but if we
decrease the sub-interval width, thereby increasing the number, n, of
sub-intervals, then in the limit n A ?, AL(n) and AR(n) converge to
the same limiting value, A, which is the area under the curve:
A~ lim

and (b) using right-hand side.
If AL(n) and AR(n) do not con-
verge to the same value, A, then
the integral is said to diverge, i.e.
it is not defined.
Note that the area, A, under the
curve is the sum of an infinite
number of rectangles of infinite-
simally narrow width, an addition

have restricted x to the interval [a, b] and, as seen in Figure 6.3, we
can use the concept of area under the curve of y 5 f(x) to give a
visualisation of the value of the integral.
6.2.1.1 Negative ‘Areas’
Attractive though the concept of area is when f(x) ¢ 0, for x
restricted to [a, b], we do need to be careful if f(x) also takes negative
values in [a, b]. It turns out that, for those regions where the curve lies
below the x axis, the contribution from f(x) to the definite integral is
negative. If it transpires that A 5 0, this is perfectly acceptable, as the
definite integral has equal positive and negative contributions (see
Figure 6.4); likewise, if the curve lies below the x axis, the definite
integral will have a negative value.
6.2.2 A Chemical Example: Where is the Electron in the Hydrogen
Atom?
Consider the radial probability density function, D(r) for the ground
state of the hydrogen atom. This function describes the probability
per unit length of finding an electron at a radial distance between r
and r + dr (see Figure 6.5).
The probability of finding the electron between r and r + dr is
D(r)dr, and corresponds to the area under the curve between r and r +
dr. Thus the area under the curve between r 5 0 and infinity simply
gives us the probability of finding the electron somewhere in the
interval 0 to ‘, which we know intuitively must be unity.
Before we discuss the definite integral any further, we first explore
integration as the inverse operation to differentiation. This will
prepare us for a most important result that enables us to evaluate the
definite integral of f(x), without first plotting the function as a prelude
to computing the area under the curve.

6.3 The Indefinite Integral
The indefinite integral of a function y 5 f(x) is usually written as:
ð
f x
ð Þdx~F x
ð ÞzC,
ð6:9Þ
where:
N f(x) is known as the integrand
N C is an arbitrary constant called the constant of integration
N F(x) + C is known as the indefinite integral.
The new function, y 5 F(x) + C, which we obtain after integration,
must be such that its derivative is equal to f(x) to ensure that the
definition conforms with the requirement that integration is the
reverse (or inverse) of differentiation. Thus, we must have:
d
dx F x
ð ÞzC
ð
Þ~F’ x
ð Þ~f x
ð Þ:
ð6:10Þ
The relation between the indefinite integral of f(x) and f(x) itself is
shown schematically in Figure 6.6 for the functions f(x) 5 18x2 and
F(x) 5 6x3.
So, to summarise: the indefinite integral is determined by finding a
suitable function, F(x), which, on differentiation, yields the function we
are trying to integrate, and to which we then add a constant. In
common with the strategies described in Chapter 4 for finding the
derivative of a given function, an analogous set of strategies can be
constructed for finding the indefinite integral of a function. For simple

6.4 General Strategies for Solving More Complicated
Integrals
Integrals involving complicated forms for f(x) require strategies for
reducing the integral to one or more integrals of simpler (standard)
form, thus making it possible to find F(x). If all else fails, or we do not
have an explicit form for f(x), then numerical integration must be
carried out using methods described elsewhere.1
Some of the strategies involved in simplifying the form of an
integral are quite straightforward; for example:
N If f (x) is in the form of a linear combination of simpler functions, e.g.
ð
3x2z2xz1


dx
ð6:11Þ
then we may be able to rewrite such an integral as a sum of
standard integrals that are immediately recognisable:

In practice, we may find ourselves faced with more complicated func-
tions, the solutions to which require us to use methods involving
adaptation of some of the rules for differentiation. The choice of
method more often than not involves some guesswork, but coming up
with the correct guesses is all part of the fun! In addition, it may be
necessary to use a combination of several methods. In the following two
sections, we discuss integration by parts and the substitution method.
6.4.1 Integration by Parts
The integration by parts method is appropriate for integrands of
product form. The method starts from the familiar product rule, used
in differential calculus [eqn (4.9)]:
d
dx uv
ð
Þ~v du
dx zu dv
dx
Integration over x yields:
ð d
dx uv

ð6:14Þ
and, on using the properties of differentials, the left side
ð d
dx uv
ð
Þdx
becomes
Ð
d(uv) 5 uv. It follows that re-arrangement of the above
expression yields:
ð
u dv
dx dx~uv{
ð
v du
dx dx:
ð6:15Þ
136
Maths for Chemists

Eqn (6.15) shows that the integral on the left-hand side, which is the
one sought, is replaced by two terms, one of which is another integral
which we hope is more tractable than the initial integral. The success
of the method relies on making the right choices for u and dv
dx. The
term identified as u is differentiated to form part of the integrand on
the right-hand side of eqn (6.15); the other part of the integrand is
formed by integrating the term identified as dv
dx.
Worked Problem 6.2
Q. Given the integrand f(x) 5 xcosx, find the indefinite integral.
A. The integrand is the product of x and cos x, and in this case
we identify x with u and dv
dx with cos x in eqn (6.15):
u~x and dv
dx ~ cos x:
Thus, du
dx ~1 and v5sin x, and so eqn (6.15) becomes:
ð
x cosxdx~x sinx{
ð
sin xdx:
The final step simply requires us to evaluate
Ð
sinxdx which we
know by reference to Table 6.2 to be 2cos x + C. Thus:
ð
x cos xdx~x sin xz cos xzD
where D 5 2C. If, on the other hand, we had identified u and
dv
dx the other way round, we end up with a more complicated
integral to evaluate:
ð
x cos xdx~x2 cos xz
ð x2
2 sin xdx
Clearly, some practice is required in identifying u and dv
dx for use in
eqn (6.15), when it seems that integration by parts is appropriate.

Comment on which choice you think is the most appropriate for
this integral.
6.4.2 Integration Using the Substitution Method
The second integration technique, known as the substitution method,
derives from the inversion of the chain rule for differentiation
described in Chapter 4. The objective here, once again, is to transform
the integrand into a simpler or, preferably, a standard form. However,
similar to the integration by parts method, there is usually a choice of
substitutions and, although in some cases, different substitutions yield
different answers, these answers must only differ by a constant
(remember that, for an indefinite integral, the answer is determined by
inclusion of a constant). The substitution method is best illustrated
using a worked problem:
Worked Problem 6.3
Q. Evaluate
Ð
xeax2dx.
A. Here f x
ð Þ~xeax2. Let us try the substitution u 5 ax2 in order
to transform the integral over x to an integral over u. From the
properties of differentials we know that:
du~ du
dx dx~2axdx
This result enables us to express dx in terms of du, according to
dx~ 1
2ax du, thus transforming the integral into:
ð
xeu du
2ax ~ 1
2a
ð
eudu~ 1
2a euzC
We now express the result in terms of the original variable, x, by
substituting back for u:

6.4.2.1 Use of Trigonometrical Substitutions
The integrand in Problem 6.5 is of a form which suggests that a
trigonometrical substitution might be appropriate. Bearing in mind
the key identity cos2 u + sin2 u 5 1, the appearance of a factor such as
(12x2)1/2 in the integrand suggests the substitutions x 5 cos u or x 5
sin u. Thus, for the substitution x 5 cos u, the factor (1 2 x2)1/2
becomes (1 2 cos2 u)1/25 sin u.
Problem 6.7
(a) Repeat Problem 6.5, using the trigonometrical substitution

your integration. You should have obtained the same result as

6.4.2.2 General Comment
The choice of method for evaluating indefinite integrals relies on
experience to a large extent. Sometimes, integration by parts and the
substitution methods are equally applicable, but in many cases they
are not. For example, the integration by parts method is much more
suited to finding the integral of the function f(x) 5 x cos x described
in Worked Problem 6.2, than the substitution method (which would
prove frustrating and fruitless in this case). It may also be necessary to
use several applications of one or both methods before the answer is
accessible. However, whichever method is used, the answer may
always be checked by verifying that F9(x) 5 f(x).
6.5 The Connection Between the Definite and Indefinite
Integral
As we saw in Section 6.2.1, the concept of integration emerged from
attempts to determine the area bounded by a plot of a function f(x),
and the x-axis, within some interval [a, b]. This area is given by the
definite integral, the definition of which derives from numerical
methods involving limits (see Section 6.2.1). Such numerical methods
can be tedious to apply in practice (although instructive) but,
fortunately, there is a direct link between the indefinite integral, F(x)
+ C, of a function, f(x), and the definite integral, in which x is con-
strained to the interval [a, b]. The relationship between the two forms of
integration is provided by the fundamental theorem of calculus:
ðb

f x
ð Þdx~ F b
ð ÞzC
ð
Þ{ F a
ð ÞzC
ð
Þ
~F b
ð Þ{F a
ð Þ
ð6:16Þ
where F(a) is the value of F(x) at x 5 a and F(b) is the value of F(x) at
x 5 b. In other words, the definite integral over the interval [a, b] is
obtained by subtracting the indefinite integral at the point x 5 a from
that at x 5 b. Furthermore, we see that the constant of integration,
which appears in the indefinite integral, does not appear in the final
result [see eqn (6.16)].

Summary of Key Points
This chapter provides an introduction to integral calculus,
together with examples set in a chemical context. As we shall see
in the following chapter, we also need integral calculus to solve
the differential equations which appear in chemical kinetics,
quantum mechanics, spectroscopy and other areas of chemistry.
The key points discussed in this chapter include:
1.
The definition of integration as the inverse of differentia-
tion, yielding the indefinite integral.
2.
The definition of integration as a means of evaluating the
area bounded by a plot of a function over a given interval,
and the x-axis 2 yielding the definite integral.
3.
The use of integration by parts method for integrating
products of functions.
4.
The use of the substitution method for reducing more
complicated functions to a simpler or standard form.
5.
The use of trigonometric substitutions in the substitution
method.

Differential Equations
In Chapter 2 we explored some of the methods used for finding the
roots of algebraic equations in the form y 5 f(x). In all of the
examples given, we were seeking to determine the value of an
unknown (typically the value of the independent variable, x) that
resulted in a particular value for y, the dependent variable. In general,
the methods discussed can be used to solve algebraic equations where
the dependent variable takes a value other than zero, because the
equation can always be rearranged into a form in which y 5 0. For
example, if we seek the solution to the equation:
4~x2{5
then we can rearrange it to:
0~x2{9
by subtracting 4 from both sides. The problem now boils down to one
in which we search for the two roots of the equation which, in this
case, are x 5 ¡3.
In this chapter, we are concerned with equations containing
derivatives of functions. Such equations are termed differential
equations, and arise in the derivation of model equations describing
processes involving rates of change, as in, for example:
N
Chemical kinetics (concentrations changing with time).
N
Quantum chemical descriptions of bonding (probability density
changing with position).
N
Vibrational spectroscopy (atomic positional coordinates changing
with time).
In these three, as well as in other examples, we are trying to
determine how the chosen property (such as concentration, prob-
ability density or atomic position) varies with respect to time,
position, or some other variable. This is a problem which requires the
solution of one or more differential equations in a procedure that is
made possible by using the tools of differentiation and integration
discussed in Chapters 4 and 6, respectively.

Aims:
This chapter builds on the content of earlier chapters to develop
techniques for solving equations associated with processes
involving rates of change. By the end of this chapter you
should be able to:

Identify a differential equation and classify it according to
its order.

of differential equations.

which must be solved for y as a function of x. In other words, the
solution to this problem will provide us with an equation which shows
quantitatively how y varies as a function of x. The solution is, of
course, provided by the original eqn (7.1) but the purpose here is to
explore the means by which we find that out for ourselves!
If we now differentiate eqn (7.2) with respect to x, and substitute
for dy
dx using eqn (7.3), we obtain the second order differential
equation (7.4):
d2y

ð7:4Þ
This differential equation is of second order, simply because the
highest order derivative is two.
Problem 7.1
(a) Express the first and second derivatives of the function,
y 5 1 / x, in the form of differential equations, and give

(c)
Show that the function y 5 Ae4x is a solution of the
differential equations dy

The last part of Problem 7.1 demonstrates that a given function does
not necessarily correspond to the solution of only one differential
equation. In later sections we shall address the question of how to
determine the number of different functions (where each function
differs from another by more than simply multiplication by a
constant) that are solutions of a given differential equation.
7.2 Some Examples of Differential Equations Arising in
Classical and Chemical Contexts
One of the principal motivations for the development of calculus by
Newton and Leibniz in the 18th Century came from the need to solve
physical problems. Examples of such problems include:
If the function y5Ae4x is a solu-
tion to Problem 7.1(c), then so is

In these last two example equations of motion, the objective is to
determine functions of the form h 5 f(t) or x 5 g(t), respectively,
which satisfy the appropriate differential equation. For example, the
solution of the classical harmonic motion equation is an oscillatory
function, x 5 g(t), where g(t) 5 cos vt, and v defines the frequency of
oscillation. This function is represented schematically in Figure 7.1

In the case of a first order differential equation, the constant of
integration is usually determined by a boundary condition, or

then this boundary condition is sufficient to determine the constant of
integration, C. Thus, out of the family of possible solutions, only one
solution is acceptable and this is the one satisfying the boundary
condition.
For example, if the boundary condition for the solution of the
differential equation in Worked Problem 7.1, is such that y 5 3 at x 5
0, then the solution is constrained to take the form:
y~F x
ð Þz3~ x3
3 zxz3
since F(0) 5 0 ) C 5 3 (see the dashed-line solution in Figure 7.2).
It should be noted that, in most chemical situations, we rarely need
the general solution of a differential equation associated with a
particular property, because one (or more) boundary conditions will
almost invariably be defined by the problem at hand and must be
obeyed; for example:
N
In a first order reaction, concentration of the reacting species is
specified at one particular time (usually at the start of the
reaction).
N
The value of the radial part of an atomic orbital wavefunction
must tend to zero at very large distances from the nucleus.
As the number of boundary conditions is usually the same as the
order of the differential equation for a particular chemical problem,
there will be no undetermined constants of integration associated with
the solution.

7.3.3.1 Separation of Variables Method
Suppose we are required to solve a differential equation of the form
eqn (7.11), in which dy
dx is equal to the product of two functions, each
of which depends only on one of the variables:
dy
dx ~f x
ð Þg y
ð Þ:
ð7:13Þ
This equation is solved by first rewriting it in the form:

which, on integration with respect to x , yields:

Since the differentials dx and dy are linked by the expression

of the equation can be transformed into an integration over y:
ð

It now just remains to carry out separate integrations over y and x in
order to obtain the required solution in the form of an expression of
the general form

ð7:17Þ
Notice, that, although each integral yields one constant of
integration, the two constants of integration can be combined into
a single constant, C, by taking A over to the right-hand side of
eqn (7.17).
The procedure just described is known as the separation of variables
method. In some instances, it is possible to re-write eqn (7.17) in the
form y 5 P(x), to give an explicit relation between y and x [where B is
contained within P(x)]. In other cases, the solution may have to be left
in a form of an implicit relation between y and x (see Section 2.3.5).

7.3.4 Separable First Order Differential Equations in Chemical
Kinetics
Consider a first order rate process, with rate constant k:
A ?

The rate of loss of the reactant A is proportional to its concentration,
and is expressed in the form of the differential equation:
{ d A
½ 
dt ~k A
½ ,
ð7:19Þ
where [A] is the concentration of the reactant at time t. Notice here
that [A] is the dependent variable, and t the independent variable.
We are interested in solving eqn (7.19) to obtain an expression
which describes how the concentration of A varies with time, subject
to the boundary condition that the concentration of the reactant at
time t 5 0 is [A]0 (note that the differential rate law above tells us only
how the rate depends on [A]). Thus, using the separation of variables
method, eqn (7.19) is first rearranged to:
{ d A

and then integrated, recognising that k is a constant:

If we now impose the boundary condition above, we find that
C 5 2ln [A]0, and the integrated rate eqn (7.22) becomes:

Note that in eqn (7.23a), [A] is an implicit function of t;
furthermore, there is a linear relation between ln [A] and t. Thus, a
plot of ln [A] against t will give a straight line of slope 2k and
intercept ln [A]. Alternately, we can rearrange eqn (7.23b) by taking
the exponential of each side, to generate an explicit function which
shows the exponential decay of [A] as a function of time (see
Figure 7.3 and Chapter 2):

An important feature of such first order reactions is the half-life,
t1/2, which is the time taken for [A] to reduce to half of its initial value.
Thus, for t 5 t1/2, we have:

Using the property of logarithms that ln 1

and it follows that the half-life is expressed in terms of the rate

in which the dependent variable (here y) appears on the left-hand side

There are thus two integrations to perform, one to determine the
integrating factor, and the other, which involves the product R(x)Q(x)
as the integrand. Since we are dealing with a first order differential
equation, we expect only one constant of integration but, from the
above discussion, it appears that two such constants may arise. We
now describe why there is, in fact, only one undetermined constant of
integration.
7.3.5.1 The Constant of Integration
In determining the integrating factor, the complete expression
becomes:
R x
ð Þ~eg x
ð ÞzC~Aeg x
ð Þ,
ð7:34Þ
where g(x) + C is the indefinite integral of the function P(x) and A 5
eC. Thus, if we now substitute eqn (7.34) into eqn (7.32), we obtain:
y~
1
Aeg x
ð Þ :A
ð
eg x
ð ÞQ x
ð Þdx:
ð7:35Þ
Since the constant A appears in both the numerator and denominator
in the right side of eqn (7.35), it can be cancelled to yield the general
solution of eqn (7.31):
y~e{g x
ð Þ
ð
eg x
ð ÞQ x
ð Þdx:
ð7:36Þ
Only one constant of integration will be produced from the indefinite
integral
Ð
eg(x)Q(x)dx and, since the constant arising from the
determination of R(x) can be discarded, we see that a single constant
of integration arises from the solution to a first order differential
equation, as expected.

7.3.6 First Order Differential Equations in Radioactive Decay
Processes
Consider the following radioactive b2 decay processes, involving two
sequential first order steps, in which l1 and l2 are decay constants
(analogous to rate constants in a chemical kinetic process) associated
with the emission of energetic electrons:
239
92U ?
l1
239
93 Np ?
l2
239
94 Pu:
ð7:37Þ
The amounts of 239
92U, 239
93Np, and 239
94Pu (units mol) at any given time
are denoted by N1, N2, N3, respectively, and we specify that, initially,
N151 mol. The change in the amount of 239
93Np with time has two
contributions: one from the decay of 239
92U and the other from the
decay of 239
93Np itself. Thus, on the basis that these processes are first
order in nature, the net rate of increase of 239
93Np is given by:
dN2
dt ~l1N1{l2N2
ð7:38Þ
By analogy with the first order chemical reaction [eqn (7.25)] we know
that N1~ N1

92U. Thus
239U is produced when 238U, the
most common isotope of ura-
nium, absorbs a neutron. The
subsequent sequential decay
process produces 239Pu, a fis-
sionable material that can be
used as a fuel in nuclear reactors
or as the core material of a
nuclear bomb. 1 mol of
239
92U
equates to 239 g by mass, which
is approximately one twentieth of
the amount needed to make a
nuclear device.

Given that the half-lives for 239

the values of the decay constants l1 and l2.
(g) Use the expression for N2 derived in part (c) to determine
the time at which N2 reaches its maximum value, and give
the corresponding amount of N2 reached at this time.

In Problem 7.5, the large disparity in the decay constants leads to a
situation in which the number of 239
93Np species builds up rapidly to its
maximum value, and then decreases slowly (see Figure 7.4).

Consider the following kinetic process, involving two sequential first
order steps:
A ?
k1
B ?
k2
C,
This is the same model process that we described above for
radioactive decay of 239
92U and, if we substitute decay constants by
rate constants, and amount of substance by concentration, and
assume that [A]0 5 1 mol dm23, we can adapt eqn (7.40) derived in
Problem 7.5(c) to describe how [B] varies with time:

If we consider initially the limiting case, in which the rate constant
k2 (governing the second step) is very much smaller than k1 (e.g. k1 5
2 s21, k2 5 0.01 s21), we obtain a plot of [B] over the time interval 0 to
30 s shown in Figure 7.5.
We can see in Figure 7.5 that, at the start of the reaction, the
concentration of the intermediate, B, initially rises quite rapidly to a
maximum, and thereafter declines slowly. The level to which the

concentration of B builds up will depend on the rate constants
governing the two steps. For reactions where the rate constant k2 is
very much larger than for k1, the concentration of B never has the
opportunity to build up and remains essentially constant throughout
most of the reaction. Under such conditions it is said to have reached
a steady state.
Problem 7.6
(a) Use eqn (7.41) to plot [B] / mol dm23 against t / s (see hint
below), using first k1 5 2 s21, k2 5 3 s21 and second k1 5
2 s21, k2 5 10 s21.
(b) Comment on the maximum values of [B] obtained in
Figure 7.5, and in your plots generated in part (a).
Hint: If possible, you should use a computing plotting program
to generate your plots. If you do not have access to such a
program, a plotter is available on the Internet at http://
www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematics/geomath/plot.html. In order to
use such a plotter, you will need to enter the model expression
for [B] / [A]0 into a function descriptor box. Thus, in order to
generate the plot shown in Figure 7.5, we would enter an
expression such as:

7.4 Second Order Differential Equations
In Section 7.1, we saw how differential equations of second order can
be generated from a particular function. Thus, for example, if we
differentiate the function y5e2x twice, we obtain:
dy
dx ~2y
ð7:42Þ
from the first differentiation and then:
d2y
dx2 ~4y,
ð7:43Þ
from the second. Eqn (7.43) is an example of a second order
differential equation. If we now reverse this process, we need two acts
of integration to yield an expression for y. However, as each
integration step leads to a constant of integration, the resulting
expression for y, which now contains two undetermined constants,
represents the general solution of the second order differential
eqn (7.43).
In general, a second order differential equation will take the form:
d2y
dx2 ~G dy
dx ,y,x


ð7:44Þ
where G dy
dx ,y,x


can, in principle, represent any function of dy
dx , y
and x. In the example above, eqn (7.43) is not, in fact, a function of
dy
dx or x, and so we can write instead that eqn (7.43) has the form
d2y
dx2 ~G y
ð Þ:

which we encounter in chemistry, are second order linear differential
equations which take the general form:
d2y

ð Þ dy
dx zS x
ð Þy~Q x

ð7:45Þ
Unfortunately, unlike the general linear first order differential
equation (7.31), there is no simple template which provides the
solution, and we need therefore to apply different methods to suit the
equation we meet in the chemical context. Equations of the general
form given in eqn (7.45) crop up in all branches of the physical
sciences in which a system is under the influence of an oscillatory or

periodic change. In chemistry, some of the most important examples
can be found in modelling:
N
Vibrational motions of molecules.
N
The interaction of molecules with electromagnetic radiation
(light).
N
The radial motion of the electron in a hydrogen-like species.
As a first example, we will consider the differential equation
describing the dynamics of simple harmonic motion, and demonstrate
how the general solution is found.
7.4.1 Simple Harmonic Motion
The special case of eqn (7.45) with P(x) 5 Q(x) 5 0 and S(x) equal to
a positive constant, n2 (the choice of n2 as the constant ensures that it
is positive quantity for any real value for n), gives rise to eqn (7.46) for
simple harmonic motion, the solution of which can be used to model
nuclear motion in molecules:
d2y
dx2 ~{n2y
ð7:46Þ
Thus, for example, if we apply eqn (7.46) to describe the periodic
vibrational motion in a diatomic molecule, x represents time, and
positive and negative values for y correspond to bond extension and
compression, respectively. Finally, we can see that eqn (7.46) is an
eigenvalue equation in which y is the eigenfunction and 2n2 the
eigenvalue (see Section 4.3.1).
Worked Problem 7.4
Q. The form of eqn (7.46) implies that y is such that its second
derivative is a negative multiple of itself (since n2 is positive real

(b) Functions (i) and (ii) are both solutions of the
differential eqn (7.46), but neither of them forms the
general solution, which must contain two, as yet
undetermined, constants of integration. Neither of
functions (iii) nor (iv) are solutions because they lead
to the constant n2 rather than 2n2.
(c) We can obtain the general solution from the sum of
constant multiples of the two solutions obtained in (a)
(i) and (ii) above to give y 5 A cos nx + B sin nx. We can
cross-check our answer by substituting the function and
its second derivative into eqn (7.46):

(d) On substituting the boundary condition values y 5 0,
x 5 0 into the general solution, we find that 0 5 A, and
hence the solution becomes y 5 B sin nx.
(e) We can further refine our solution by applying the
second of our two boundary conditions. If y 5 0 when
x 5 L, then:
B sin nL~0
which is satisfied when nL 5 mp (where m is an integer).
Thus, n~ mp
L
and the required solution is:
Neither of equations (iii) and (iv)
are solutions to eqn (7.46).
However, if n was such that n2
was negative, then both functions
would be solutions to the equa-
tion. This would require us to
define the square root of a nega-
tive number, which is at odds with
our understanding of what con-
stitutes a real number. In Chapter
9, we extend the concept of the
number to include so called ima-
ginary and complex numbers
which embrace the idea that the
square root of a negative number
can be defined.

7.4.3 How is an Eigenvalue Problem Recognised?
The simplest way of thinking about an eigenvalue problem is to
consider the result of some operator, Aˆ, acting on a suitable function,
f(x), to yield a constant, l, multiplied by the original function, f(x):
Differential Equations
165

^Af x
ð Þ~lf x
ð Þ:
ð7:51Þ
The objective in this type of problem is to find the eigenfunctions,
f(x), and associated eigenvalues, l, for a given operator, ^A. The
solution will generally yield a number of different eigenfunctions, and
associated eigenvalues, all of which emerge from a single general
solution.
The procedure used to solve second order differential equations of
the form of eqn (7.50) is essentially the same as that described in
Worked Problem 7.4 and involves the construction of trial
eigenfunctions from some of the functions introduced in Chapter 2.
7.4.3.1 The Search for Eigenfunctions
We first re-write eqn (7.49), using differentiation operators ^D2~ d2
dx2
and ^D~ d
dx to give:
^D2yzc1 ^Dy~{c2y:
ð7:52Þ
Factorising yields:
^D2zc1 ^D


y~{c2y,
ð7:53Þ
which is of the form of an eigenvalue equation:
^Ay~{c2y,
where:
^A~^D2zc1 ^D
ð7:54Þ
is the operator; y is the eigenfunction, and 2c2 the eigenvalue. The
form of the operator Aˆ is such that its eigenfunctions must be
functions whose first and second derivatives differ only by a constant.
The choice of f(x) to label a
function is entirely arbitrary – in
principle, any label will do. We
could just as easily have labelled
it y(x), G(x), w, c or y. Later on we
do use the label y to represent the
eigenfunction of a given operator,
but y is also routinely used to
name the value of the dependent
variable for some given function,
and as a result it can be confus-
ing sometimes to distinguish
between the label applied to the
function itself and the label
applied to the value of the func-
tion for a particular choice of
independent variable.

The key feature emerging from Worked Problem 7.6 is that if two
functions, f1 and f2, are eigenfunctions of an operator Aˆ, and have the
same eigenvalues, l, then an arbitrary linear combination of the two
functions is also an eigenfunction of Aˆ with eigenvalue, l. In this
example, the two functions y 5 cos nx and y 5 sin nx are both
eigenfunctions of the ^D2 operator with eigenvalue 2n2. Consequently,
it follows that an arbitrary linear combination of the two functions is
also an eigenfunction of this operator with eigenvalue 2n2. This

function by finding the appropriate values of n that are
consistent with this operator, and an eigenvalue l 5 22.

Power Series
In Chapter 2, we saw that a polynomial function, P(x), of degree n in
the independent variable, x, is a finite sum of the form:
P x
ð Þ~c0zc1xzc2x2z . . . zcnxn:
ð8:1Þ
Such polynomial functions have as a domain the set of all real
(finite) numbers; in other words they yield a finite result for any real
value of the independent variable x. For example, the polynomial
function:
P x
ð Þ~1zxzx2zx3
ð8:2Þ
will have a finite value for any real number x because each term in the
polynomial will also have a finite value.
An infinite series is very similar in form to a polynomial, except that
it does not terminate at a particular power of x and, as a result, is an
example of a power series:
p x
ð Þ~c0zc1xzc2x2z . . . zcnxnz . . .
ð8:3Þ
One important consequence of this lack of termination is that we
need to specify a domain which includes only those real numbers, x,
for which p(x) is finite. For example, the power series:
p x
ð Þ~1zxzx2zx3z . . .
ð8:4Þ
does not yield a finite result for x . 1, or for x , 21, because in the
former case, the summation of terms increases without limit and, in
the latter, it oscillates between increasingly large positive and negative
numbers as more and more terms are included. Try this for yourself
by substituting the numbers x 5 2 and x 5 22 into eqn (8.4) and then
x 5 0.5 and x 5 20.5 and observe what happens to the sum as more
and more terms are included.
Power series are useful in chemistry (as well as in physics,
engineering and mathematics) for a number of reasons.

N
Firstly, they provide a means to formulate alternative representa-
tions of transcendental functions such as the exponential,
logarithm and trigonometric functions introduced in Chapter 2.
N
Secondly, as a direct result of the above, they also allow us to
investigate how an equation describing some physical property
behaves for small (or large) values for one of the independent
variables.
For example, the radial part of the 3s atomic orbital for hydrogen
has the same form as the expression:
R x
ð Þ~N 2x2{18xz27


e{x=3:
ð8:5Þ
If we replace the exponential part of the function, e2x/3, with the
first two terms of its power series expansion (1 2 x/3), we obtain a
polynomial approximation to the radial function given by:
R x

ð8:6Þ
We can see how well eqn (8.6) approximates eqn (8.5), by
comparing plots of the two functions in the range 0 ¡ x ¡ 20, as
shown in Figure 8.1. In this example, the polynomial approxima-
tion to the form of the radial wave function gives an excellent fit
for small values of x (i.e. close to the nucleus), but it fails to
reproduce even one radial node [a value of x for which R(x) 5 0].
N
Thirdly, power series are used when we do not know the formula
of association between one property and another. It is usual in
such situations to use a power series to describe the formula of
Figure 8.1

by varying the appropriate coefficients in an iterative manner.
For example, the parameters, a, b and c, in the polynomial
expression:

ð Þ, where g T
ð Þ~azbTzcT2,
describing the temperature dependence of the specific heat
capacity of a substance at constant pressure, CP, may be found
by fitting measured values of CP over a range of temperatures to
this equation.
Much of this chapter is concerned with a discussion of power series
but, before we go into detail, we consider the general concepts of
sequences and series, both finite and infinite.
Aims:
By the end of this chapter, you should be comfortable with
the idea that functions can be represented in series form and be
able to:
N
Understand the distinction between Maclaurin and Taylor
series expansions and appreciate when one or the other is
the more appropriate.
N
Understand what factors influence the accuracy of a given
power series expansion;
N
Determine the values of x for which the power series is
useful (the interval of convergence).
N
Understand why the interval of convergence may differ
from the domain of the original function.
N
Manipulate power series to obtain series for new functions.
N
Apply some of the ideas explored in this chapter to probe
the limiting behaviour of functions for increasingly large or
small values of the independent variable.
8.1 Sequences
A sequence is simply a list of terms:
u1, u2, u3, . . .
ð8:7Þ
Power Series
173

each of which is defined by a formula or prescription. The sequence
may be finite or infinite, depending on whether it terminates at un, or
continues indefinitely. Furthermore, the sequence u1, u2, u3, …
represents a function, with a domain specified either as a subset of the
positive integers or all positive integers.
8.1.1 Finite Sequences
8.1.1.1 The Geometric Progression
The numbers:
1, 2, 4, 8, . . . , 256
form a finite sequence generated by the general term:
ur~2r, where r~0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 8:
ð8:8Þ
Here, the formula is only 2 raised to a power, the value of which is
defined by each element of the domain. Notice that the use of r as a
counting index is arbitrary: any other appropriate letter (with the
exception of u which we have used already) would do. A counting
index such as r is often termed a dummy index. An alternative way of
generating this sequence is accomplished using a recurrence relation as
the prescription, where each successive term is obtained from the
previous term. For example, the sequence given in eqn (8.8) can
alternatively be expressed as:
ur~
1, r~0
2ur{1, r~1, 2, 3, . . . , 8

ð8:9Þ
which simply means that, starting from 1 as the first term, each
successive term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
The finite sequence in eqn (8.8) is an example of a geometric
progression, having the general form:
a, ax, ax2, ax3, . . . , ax8
ð8:10Þ
In the case of the geometric progression defined by eqn (8.8), a 5 1,
x 5 2 and ur 5 axr for r 5 0, 1, 2, …
8.1.1.2 Arithmetic Progression
Consider the sequence of odd positive numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, …, 31,
which can be expressed either in terms of the general term:
174
Maths for Chemists

ur~2r{1, r~1, 2, 3, . . . , 16
ð8:11Þ
or as a recurrence relation expressed in prescription form:
ur~
1, r~1
ur{1z2, r~2, 3, . . . , 8

ð8:12Þ
This finite sequence is an example of an arithmetic progression,
because each successive term is given by a sum having the general
form:
a, azd, az2d, az3d, . . . , aznd
ð8:13Þ
where, in this example, a 5 1, d 5 2.
8.1.2 Sequences of Indefinite Length
In the sequence given in eqn (8.13), the magnitudes of successive terms
progressively increase. Some sequences, however, have the property
that as the number of terms increases, the values of successive terms
appear to be approaching a limiting value. For example, the terms in
the harmonic sequence:
1, 1
2 , 1
3 , 1
4 , . . . , 1
n , . . . ,
ð8:14Þ
where ur 5 1 / r, r 5 1, 2, 3,…, decrease in magnitude as r increases,
and approach zero as r tends to infinity. Thus, we can define the limit
of the sequence as:
lim
r?? ur
ð
Þ~ lim
r??
1
r ~0:
ð8:15Þ
If the limit of a sequence is a single finite value, say, m, then:
lim
r?? ur
ð
Þ~m
ð8:16Þ
and the sequence is said to converge to the limit m. However, if this is
not the case, then the sequence is said to diverge. Thus, for the
arithmetic progression defined in eqn (8.13), the magnitudes of
successive values in the sequence increase without limit and the
sequence diverges. In contrast, the geometric progression in eqn (8.10)
will converge to a limiting value of zero if 21 , x , 1.

convergence occurs, give the limiting value.

(b) un~ n{1
2n , n~1, 2, . . . ;
(c)

8.1.3 Functions Revisited
In our discussion of algebraic manipulation in Chapter 1, we used the
three-spin model for counting the various permitted orientations of
three spin-K nuclei. If we focus on the number of arrangements where
r nuclei are in the spin-up state, then we see that there is only one
arrangement where none of the nuclei has spin up; three where one
nucleus has spin up; three where two nuclei have spin up; and
one where all three nuclei have spin up. Thus, we can define the
sequence 1, 3, 3, 1, where the general term is given by ur~3!= 3{r
ð
Þ!r!,
(r 5 0, 1, 2, 3). In general, the number of ways of selecting r specified
objects from n objects is given by the expression nCr~n!= n{r
ð
Þ!r!.
In this example, there are three nuclei and so n 5 3, and there are
3Cr(r 5 0, 1, 2, 3) ways in which 0, 1, 2 and 3 nuclei have spin up.
Problem 8.2
Find the sequence that represents the number of arrangements
of six spin-K nuclei, with r spin–up arrangements, where r now
runs from 0 to 6.
8.2 Finite Series
For any sequence of terms u1, u2, u3, … we can form a finite series by
summing the terms in the sequence up to and including the nth term:
Sn~u1zu2zu3z    zun~
X
n
r~1
ur
ð8:17Þ
We first met the summation
notation S in Chapter 1. In this
example, the counting index, r,
takes values from 1 to n.
176
Maths for Chemists

For example, the sum of the first n terms in the series obtained from
the sequence defined by eqn (8.8) is given by:
Sn~1z2z22z . . . z2n{1:
ð8:18Þ
Evaluating this sum for n 5 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 yields the sequence of partial
sums:
S1~1, S2~3, S3~7, S4~15 and S5~31:
ð8:19Þ
If we now look closely at this new sequence of partial sums, we may be
able to deduce that the sum of the first n terms is Sn 5 2n 2 1.
In general, for a geometric series obtained by summing the members
of the geometric progression, defined by eqn (8.10), the sum of the
first n terms is given by:
Sn~azaxzax2z    axn{1
~a 1{xn
1{x


ð8:20Þ
Problem 8.3
For the geometric series obtained by summing the first n terms
of the geometric progression in eqn (8.8), use eqn (8.20) and
appropriate values of a and x given in eqn (8.10) to confirm that
the sum of the first n terms is 2n 2 1.
8.3 Infinite Series
We can also form an infinite series from a sequence by extending the
range of the dummy index to an infinite number of terms:

r~1
ur:
ð8:21Þ
The summation of a finite series will always yield a finite result, but
the summation of an infinite series needs careful examination to
confirm that the addition of successive terms leads to a finite result,
i.e. the series converges. It is important not to confuse the notion of
convergence as applied to a series with that applied to a sequence. For
example, the harmonic sequence given by eqn (8.14) converges to the
limit zero. However, somewhat surprisingly, the harmonic series:

does not yield a finite sum, S, and consequently does not converge. In
other words the sum of the series increases without limit as the
number of terms in the series increases, even though the values of
successive terms converge to zero. We can see more easily how this is
true by breaking down the series into a sum of partial sums:

8.3.1 p Revisited – The Rate of Convergence of an Infinite Series

from the sum of an infinite series. One example given involved the
sum of the inverses of the squares of all positive integers:

ð8:26Þ
This series converges extremely slowly, requiring well over 600 terms
to provide precision to the second decimal place. In order to achieve
100 decimal places for p, we would need more than 1050 terms!
However, the alternative series:

converges more rapidly, achieving a precision to the second decimal
place in a relatively brisk 10 terms.

8.3.2 Testing a Series for Convergence
The non-convergence of the harmonic series, discussed above,
highlights the importance of testing whether a particular series is
convergent or divergent. For a series given by:
X
?
r~1
ur~u1zu2zu3z   
ð8:28Þ
the first, and necessary, condition needed to ensure convergence is
that lim
r?? ur~0. If this condition is satisfied (as it is in the series above
for determining p), we can then proceed to test the series further for
convergence. It should be emphasised, however, that satisfying this
first condition does not necessarily imply that the series converges (i.e.
we say that the first condition is not sufficient). For example, as we
have seen, the harmonic sequence is an example of one for which ur
tends to zero as r A ?, but the corresponding harmonic series is not
convergent.
8.3.2.1 The Ratio Test
A number of tests are available for confirming the convergence, or
otherwise, of a given series. The test for absolute convergence is the
simplest, and is carried out using the ratio test.
For successive terms in a series, ur and ur+1, the series:
.
converges if lim
r??

ur

v1;
ð8:29Þ

diverges if lim

w1:
ð8:30Þ
If, however, lim
r??
urz1
ur

~1, then the series may either converge or
diverge, and further tests are necessary.
8.3.2.2 The Infinite Geometric Series
The form of the geometric series in eqn (8.20) generalises to the form
of eqn (8.21) where, now:
Sn~azaxzax2z    ~

and ur 5 axr21. On using the ratio test in eqn (8.29), we find that:
lim
r??
axr
axr{1

v1:
but only when |x| , 1. This constraint on the permitted values of x,
for which the series converges, defines the interval of convergence.
In general, it may not be possible to specify the value of the sum, S,
in terms of x: instead, we chose a value of x, and compute the sum to
a given number of significant figures or decimal places.
Worked Problem 8.1
Q. (a) Give the forms of ur+1 and ur for the geometric series
1+x+x2+x3+…
(b) Use the ratio test to establish that the series converges
and find the interval of convergence.
(c) Given x 5 0.27 calculate the sum of the series to two
decimal places.
A. (a) Since the first term in the series is a constant, we
define the rth term as ur 5 xr21 and the (r + 1)th term as
ur+1 5 xr.
(b) The ratio test yields:
lim
r??
urz1
ur

~ lim
r??

~ x
j j,
and so the series converges if |x| , 1 and diverges if |x| .
1. If x 5 ¡1, then, as we saw earlier, further tests are
required to establish whether the series converges or
diverges at these end points. However, in this case, we
can see by inspection that for x 5 +1 the sum of the first
r terms will be r and thus increases without limit as
r A ?. For x 5 21, the sum oscillates between 0 and 1,
depending on whether r is even or odd. In both cases, a
finite sum is not obtained as r A ?, and we can say that
the series fails to converge for x 5 ¡1. Consequently,
the series converges if x takes the values 21 , x , 1; an
inequality that defines the interval of convergence.
(c) Let Sn designate the sum of the first n terms of the
geometric series. Table 8.1 summarises the values of Sn,
and the incremental changes for n 5 1, 2, …, 8, using
180
Maths for Chemists

x 5 0.27. We can see from the Table that in order to
specify the sum to a given number of decimal places, we
have to compute its value to one more decimal place
than required, in case rounding up is necessary. In this
case, convergence to two decimal places yields a sum of
1.370 at n 5 6.

8.4 Power Series as Representations of Functions
We have seen above that, for a geometric progression of the type
given in eqn (8.10), the sum of the first n terms is given by eqn (8.20).
Furthermore, for a 5 1, we can see that:
1{xn
1{x ~1zxzx2z    zxn{1:
ð8:31Þ
This is an important expression because it allows us to see how a
function such as 1{xn
1{x can be represented by a polynomial of degree
n 2 1. However, if we now extend the progression indefinitely to form

1{x can be represented by the
infinite series expansion 1+x+x2+…+xn21+…, which converges for
21 , x , 1. For all other values of x the expansion diverges.
The infinite geometric series is an example of a power series because
it contains a sum of terms involving a systematic pattern of change in
the power of x. In general, the simplest form of a power series is given
by:
f x
ð Þ~c0zc1xzc2x2zc3x3z    zcnxnz . . .
ð8:33Þ
where c0, c1, c2, … are coefficients and successive terms involve an
increasing power of the independent variable, x. Such series involving
simple powers of x are termed Maclaurin series. The more general
Taylor series are similar in form, but involve powers of (x 2 a):

ð8:34Þ
where a is any number other than 0 (in which case, we revert to a
Maclaurin series). The significance of the value of a is that it
represents the point about which the function is expanded. Thus the
Taylor series are expanded about the point x 5 a, whereas the
Maclaurin series are simply expanded about the point x 5 0.
Maclaurin and Taylor series are used most frequently to provide
alternative ways of representing many types of function. In addition,
such series in truncated polynomial form provide an excellent tool for
fitting experimental data when there is no model formula available.
There are two important features associated with the generation of
power series representations of functions: first, a value of x lying in
the domain of the function must be chosen for the expansion point, a;
second, the function must be infinitely differentiable at the chosen
point in its domain: in other words, differentiation of the function
Power series are so-called,
because they are sums of powers
of x with specified coefficients.

must never yield a constant function because subsequent derivatives
will be zero, and the series will be truncated to a polynomial of finite
degree. The question as to whether the power series representation of
a function has the same domain as the function itself is discussed in a
later subsection. The next subsection is concerned with determining
the coefficients, ci, for the two kinds of power series used to represent
some of the functions introduced in Chapter 2.
8.4.1 The Maclaurin Series: Expansion about the Point x 5 0
Let us start by using eqn (8.33) as a model expression to generate a
power series expansion for a function f(x), assuming that the
requirements given in the paragraph above are satisfied. In order to
obtain the explicit form of the series, we need to find values for the
coefficients c0, c1, c2, …. This is achieved in the following series of
steps:
The original function, and its first, second and third derivatives are:

and, by inspection, the nth derivative has the form:

ð8:43Þ
If we now substitute the coefficients obtained from each of the
expressions (8.39) to (8.43) into (8.35) we obtain the Maclaurin series
for f(x):
For clarity, we use a superscript
containing a counting number in
parentheses to denote a particu-
lar order of derivative.

8.4.1.2 Truncating the Exponential Power Series
For any power series expansion, the accuracy of a polynomial
truncation depends upon the number of terms included in the
expansion. Since it is impractical to include an infinite number of
terms (at which point the precision is perfect), a compromise has to be
made in choosing a sufficient number of terms to achieve the desired
accuracy. However, in truncating a Maclaurin series, the chosen
degree of polynomial is always going to best represent the function
close to x 5 0. The further away from x 5 0, the worse the
approximation becomes, and more terms are needed to compensate; a
feature which is demonstrated nicely in Figure 8.2 and Table 8.2.

In this case:

The coefficients of even powers of x are zero.
N
The denominators in the coefficients of the odd
powers of x are odd numbers (formed by adding or
subtracting 1 to or from an even number, 2n).
N
As the signs of the coefficients for c1,c3,c5,…
alternate, starting with a positive value for c1, the
factor (21)n21 takes care of the sign alternation.
N
Only odd powers of x appear, suggesting that the
index can be generated by subtracting 1 from an
even number; thus the power of x in the nth term can
be written as x2n21. (Check that this generates the
terms x, x3 and x5 by substituting n 5 1, 2 and 3,
respectively). Thus, the general term in this case is

8.4.1.4 The Problem with Guessing the General Term: A Chemical
Counter Example
In our discussion of the geometric series and the Maclaurin series for
sinx, we made the assumption, from the pattern emerging from the
first few terms, that we could predict how the series will continue ad
infinitum. In most cases, this confidence is justified, but sometimes we
encounter problems where finding the general term requires a
knowledge of the physical context of the problem. An example of
186
Maths for Chemists

such a problem in chemistry involves the computation of the ion–ion
interaction energy in an ionic solid, such as NaCl. If we compute the
interaction energy arising from the interaction between one ion
(positive or negative) and all the other ions in the NaCl lattice
structure, then we obtain the Madelung energy in the form:

ð8:47Þ
Here A is the Madelung constant for the NaCl structure, and R is the
distance between any adjacent Na+ and Cl2 ions. If we inspect the terms
in the series, we can see not only that the sign alternatives but also what
appears to be a pattern in the square root values given in the
denominators of successive terms. However, in contrast, it is very
difficult to see any pattern to the values of the numerators; the reason
being that there is none: we can only determine their values from
knowledge of the NaCl structure. In this example, the first term arises
from the interaction between a Na+ ion and the six nearest neighbour
Cl2 anions at a distance

interaction of nearest neighbour ions of the same charge, which in this

8.4.2 The Taylor Series: Expansion about Points Other Than Zero
In many situations, we need to find the power series expansion of a
function in terms of the values of the function and its derivatives at some
point other than x 5 0. For example, in the case of a vibrating diatomic
molecule, the natural choice of origin for describing the energy of the
molecule is the equilibrium internuclear separation, Re, and not R 5 0
(where the nuclei have fused). We can determine the expansion of a func-
tion f(x) about an origin x 5 a (where a is now, by definition, generally
not zero) using the Taylor series which is given by the expression:

Here, f (n)(a) is the value of the nth derivative of f(x) at the point
x 5 a. The special case where a 5 0, as discussed above, generates
the Maclaurin series.

Q. Find the Taylor series expansion for the function f(x) 5 ex

where the last term in the brackets is the nth term. We can see
from a plot of the Taylor series expansion of the exponential
function shown in Figure 8.3, that far fewer terms are necessary
to achieve a good degree of accuracy in the region around x 5 1
than is the case with the MacLaurin series. However, we also see
that the further away we are from the point x 5 1, the poorer
the approximation and the more terms we will need to achieve a
given accuracy. Although it is not obvious from Figure 8.3, the
Maclaurin series will be better than this Taylor series expansion
for values of x close to x 5 0.

energy at R 5 0 (corresponding to nuclear fusion) is finite,
rather than infinite. The minimum in the Morse potential energy
curve occurs at R 5 Re , which represents the equilibrium bond

8.4.3 Manipulating Power Series
8.4.3.1 Combining Power Series
If two functions are combined by some operation (for example
addition, multiplication, differentiation or integration) then we can
find the power series expansion of the resulting function by applying
the appropriate operation to the reference series. However, the
outcome will be valid only within a domain common to both power
series. So, for example, if the Maclaurin series for ex (interval of
convergence: all x in R) is multiplied by that for ln(1 + x) (interval of
convergence: 21 , x ¡ 1), the resulting series only converges in the
common interval of convergence 21 , x ¡ 1.

Sometimes we can generate Maclaurin series for a given function by a
simple substitution. For example, the Maclaurin series for the

and much less labour intensive, approach involves writing X 5 2x

f(x) includes all x values, with the exclusion of x 5 1, where the
function is undefined, the domain of the Maclaurin series, determined
by applying the ratio test, is restricted to 21 , x , 1. The point x 5 1
is excluded from the domains of both the function, and the series.
However, although the point x 5 21 is clearly included in the domain
of the function, since f {1
ð
Þ~1=2, it is excluded from the domain of
the series. We can further illustrate this by comparing a plot of the
function y 5 f(x) 5 (1 2 x)21 with the MacLaurin series expansion of
this function up to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth terms (see
Figure 8.5). Clearly the three plots match quite well for 21 , x , 1
but differ dramatically for all other values of x. We also see at x 5 21
that the series representation oscillates between zero and +1 as each
new term is added to the series, thus indicating divergence at this
point.
8.4.5 Limits Revisited: Limiting Forms of Exponential and
Trigonometric Functions
In Chapter 3 we discussed the behaviour of a function close to some
limiting value of the independent variable. Some of the examples
concern finite limiting values, but more often we are interested in how
functions behave for increasingly small or large values in the
independent variable. It is usually straightforward to evaluate the
limit of simple functions for increasingly large or small values of x
but, for some of the transcendental functions, we need to use power
series expansions to probe their asymptotic behaviour.

The behaviour of the function eax, as x tends to large or small values,
depends upon the signs and magnitudes of x and a. Thus:

for x 5 0, eax 5 1, irrespective of the value of a;
N
for large positive x, eax increases without limit as x increases for
a . 0, but eax becomes increasingly small as x increases for a , 0;
N
regardless of the signs of x or a, eax approaches 1, for increasingly
small values of x, according to the MacLaurin power series

Numbers Revisited: Complex

In Chapter 2, we saw that the solution of a quadratic equation of the
form:
ax2zbxzc~0
ð9:1Þ
can yield up to two real roots depending on the values of the
coefficients, a, b and c. The general solution to quadratic equations of
this form is given by the formula:
x~ {b+

ð9:2Þ
where the quantity b2 2 4ac is known as the discriminant (see Section
2.4). If the discriminant is positive, then the equation has two real and
different roots; if it is zero then the equation will have two identical
roots, and if it is negative, there are no real roots, as the formula
involves the square root of a negative number. For example, the
equation:
x2{4xz3~0
yields two real roots, x 5 3 and x 5 1, according to:

However, if we use eqn (9.2) to find the roots of the quadratic

which requires us to find the square root of 28. Graphically, we see in
Figure 9.1 that a plot of the function y 5 x2 2 4x + 6 does not cut the
x-axis at all. Logic would seem to dictate that any solution to the
second of these two equations is non-sensical, and that the result
cannot possibly be real – especially when we view the plot of the
function, which clearly does not cut the x-axis. However, there is a
way of circumventing this problem by simply extending the number
system to include so-called complex numbers, which incorporate
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

as a legitimate number. This concept can naturally seem somewhat
bemusing but, once we get over the shock, we find that the treatment
of complex numbers is really quite straightforward and, more
importantly, we find that they allow us to tackle real problems in
chemistry in a way that would otherwise be impossible.
Aims:
This chapter extends the familiar number system to include
complex numbers containing the imaginary number i. By the
end of this chapter, you should be able to:

9.2 The General Form of Complex Numbers
In the answer to Worked Problem 9.1, we obtained the required roots
of the quadratic equation in the form of a sum of a real number (21)
and an imaginary number (2i or 22i). Such numbers are termed
complex numbers, and have the general form:
z~xziy
ð9:5Þ
where x and y are real numbers, termed the real and imaginary parts
of z, respectively. Clearly, if x 5 0, y ? 0, then z is an imaginary
number (because the real part vanishes); likewise, if x ? 0, y 5 0, then
z is a real number (because the imaginary part vanishes).
9.3 Manipulation of Complex Numbers
The algebraic manipulation of pairs of complex numbers is really
quite straightforward, so long as we remember that, since i~

9.3.1 Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication
For addition or subtraction of complex numbers, the appropriate
operation is carried out separately on the real and imaginary parts of
the two numbers.
Multiplication of a complex number by a scalar (real number),
is achieved by simply multiplying the real and imaginary parts of
the complex number by the scalar quantity. Multiplication of
two complex numbers is performed by expanding the expression
The real and imaginary parts of a
complex number, z, are often
expressed as Re z, and Im z,
respectively.

(a + ib)(c + id) as a sum of terms, and then collecting the real and
imaginary parts to yield a new complex number.

3.
9.3.2 The Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate, z*, of the complex number z 5 x + iy,
is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part of z to yield
z* 5 x 2 iy. Thus, for example, the complex conjugate of the number
z2 5 21 + i, given in Problem 9.3, is z2* 5 21 2 i.
The two numbers z and z* have the properties that their sum and
product are both real, but their difference is imaginary:

(d) (1 + 3i)(3 + 2i).
9.3.3 Division of Complex Numbers
As we have seen, addition, subtraction and multiplication of complex
numbers is generally quite straightforward, requiring little more than
the application of elementary algebra. However, the division of one
complex number by another requires that a quotient such as
z1
z2
~ x1ziy1
x2ziy2
, be transformed into a complex number in the form of
eqn (9.5). The solution to this conundrum is not immediately obvious,
until we remember that the product of a complex number with its own
complex conjugate zz* is a real number [see eqn (9.7)]. This suggests
that we could achieve the required form for the quotient by
multiplying both numerator and denominator by z
2:
z1z

This has the same effect as multiplying by unity since z

allows us to express the quotient in the required form. Thus,
multiplying out the numerator and denominator on the right side of
eqn (9.9), and collecting terms, gives:

9.4 The Argand Diagram
Since a complex number is defined in terms of two real numbers, it is
convenient to use a graphical representation in which the real and
imaginary parts define a point (x, y) in a plane. Such a representation
is provided by an Argand diagram, as seen in Figure 9.2.
Problem 9.6
Plot your answers to Problem 9.3 as points in an Argand
diagram.
The location of z in the Argand diagram can be specified by using
either Cartesian coordinates (x, y), where x 5 Re z, y 5 Im z, or polar
coordinates (r, h) where, r ¢ 0 and 2p , h ¡ p. The reason for
choosing this range of h values, rather than 0 , h ¡ 2p, derives from
the convention that h should be positive in the first two quadrants
(above the x-axis), moving in an anticlockwise sense from the Re z
axis, and negative in the third and fourth quadrants (below the
x-axis), moving in a clockwise sense. The quadrant numbering runs
from 1 to 4, in an anticlockwise direction, as indicated in Figure 9.2.
Numbers Revisited: Complex Numbers
205

9.4.1 The Modulus and Argument of z
The polar coordinates r and h, define the modulus (alternatively
known as the absolute value and sometimes denoted by |z|) and
argument, respectively, of z. From Pythagoras’ Theorem, and simple
trigonometry, the modulus and argument of z are defined as follows
(see Figure 9.2):

Þ
ð9:12Þ
Great care is required in determining h, because it is easy to make a
mistake in specifying the correct quadrant. For example, although the
complex numbers z 5 1 2 i and z 5 21 + i both have tan h 5 21,
they lie in the fourth and second quadrants, respectively, as seen in
Figure 9.3.
If we evaluate tan21 (21), using the tan21 function on an electronic
calculator, to determine h, we obtain 20.7854 rad, which is equivalent
to 20.7854 6 180 / p 5 245u. This places z in the fourth quadrant,
which is correct for z 5 1 2 i but incorrect for z 5 21 + i. In the latter
case, we need to look at the values of x 5 Re z and y 5 Im z, and
choose the more appropriate value for h, recognising that tan(p + h)
and tan h have the same value. The use radians or degrees when
evaluating the argument of a complex number is largely a matter of

with degrees when referring to an Argand diagram because it is easier
to associate a complex number with a given quadrant in this case.

9.5 The Polar Form for Complex Numbers
So far we have assumed that a complex number takes the form
z 5 x + iy, where x and y are the values of Re z and Im z, respectively.
However, from trigonometry (see Figure 2.2) we see that:
x~r cos h and y~r sin h:
Consequently, z may be expressed in terms of r, h as:
z~r cos hzi sin h
ð
Þ:
ð9:13Þ
Eqn (9.13) is not yet in a form that is fundamentally different from
the Cartesian form expressed in eqn (9.5). However, we can obtain an
alternative, more compact, and far more powerful way of writing the
polar form of a complex number by re-visiting the Maclaurin series
for the sinh, cosh and exponential functions. The Maclaurin series for
cosine and sine are:

and hence show that eqn (9.17) is equivalent to eqn (9.16).

9.5.4 Complex Functions
So far we have been concerned largely with the concept of the
complex number, but we can see from our discussion of Euler’s
formula that the general form of a complex number actually
represents a complex mathematical function, say f(h), where:
f h
ð Þ~cos hzi sin h:
ð9:31Þ
This function comprises a real part and an imaginary part, and so, in
general, we can define a complex function in the form:
f x
ð Þ~g x
ð Þzih x
ð Þ
ð9:32Þ
where the complex conjugate of the function is given by:
f x
ð Þ~g x
ð Þ{ih x
ð Þ
ð9:33Þ
Thus f(x)f(x)* is a real function of the form:
f x
ð Þf x
ð Þ~g x
ð Þ2zh x
ð Þ2
ð9:34Þ
The property of complex functions given in eqn (9.34) plays a very
important role in quantum mechanics, where the wave function of an
212

electron, y, which may be complex in form, is related to the physically
meaningful probability density through the product yy*. If y is a
complex function, then, from eqn (9.34), yy* is a real function.
9.5.4.1 The Periodicity of the Exponential Function
It may seem odd to think of the exponential function, ex, as periodic
because it is clearly not so when the exponent, x, is real. However,
replacing x with the imaginary number ih yields the complex number
z 5 eih whose modulus and argument are 1 and h, respectively. If we
represent the values of the function on an Argand diagram, we see
that they lie on a circle of radius, r 5 1, in the complex plane (see
Figure 9.4). Different values of h then define the location of complex
numbers of modulus unity on the circumference of the circle. We can
also see that the function is periodic, with period 2p:

9.5.4.2 The Eigenvalue Problem Revisited
The three 2p orbitals resulting from the solution of the Schro¨dinger
equation for the hydrogen atom can be written as:
y1~N1e{r=2a0r sin heiw; y0~N2e{r=2a0r cos h;
y{1~N1e{r=2a0r sin he{iw,
where N1 and N2 are constants, a0 is the Bohr radius, r is the distance
of the electron from the nucleus, and the suffix attached to each y
indicates the value of the orientation quantum number ml. The
Schro¨dinger equation, Hˆ y 5 Ey, is an example of an eigenvalue
problem (see Sections 4.3.1 and 7.4.3) where, in this case, Hˆ is an
operator known as the Hamiltonian, E is the eigenvalue (correspond-
ing to the energy of the system), and y is the eigenfunction (or
214

wavefunction). As we saw in the earlier chapters, if two functions are
both solutions to an eigenvalue problem, associated with the same
eigenvalue, then a linear combination of the functions will also be a
solution. We can use this property to construct real orbital functions
that we can visualise more easily. We explore this idea a little further
in the next problem.

Working with Arrays I:
Determinants
In all areas of the physical sciences, we encounter problems that
require the solution of sets of simultaneous linear equations. These
range from seemingly mundane everyday problems to highly complex
problems in quantum mechanics or spectroscopy requiring the
solution of hundreds of simultaneous linear equations. For small
numbers of such equations, the solutions may be most straightfor-
wardly obtained using the methods of elementary algebra; but, as the
number of equations increases, their alegbraic solution becomes
cumbersome and ultimately intractable. In this chapter we introduce
the concept of the determinant to provide one of the tools used to
solve problems involving large numbers of simultaneous equations.
The other tools required for solving systems of linear equations
are provided by matrix algebra, which we discuss in detail in
Chapter 11.
Aims:
This chapter introduces the determinant as a mathematical
object which we can use to tackle problems involving large
numbers of simultaneous linear equations. By the end of this
chapter, you should be able to:
N
Appreciate that a determinant expands to yield an expres-
sion or value.
N
Recognise how determinants can be used to solve simulta-
neous linear equations.
N
Expand determinants of second and third order about a
given row or column.
N
Use the properties of determinants to introduce as many
zeros as possible to the right (or left) of the leading diagonal.
N
Define and evaluate the first order cofactors of a determi-
nant.

10.1 Origins – The Solution of Simultaneous Linear
Equations
We begin our discussion of linear systems by introducing the
determinant as a tool for solving sets of simultaneous linear equations
in which the indices of the unknown variables are all unity. Consider
the pair of equations:
a11xza12y~b1
ð10:1Þ
a21xza22y~b2
ð10:2Þ
where a11, a12, a21, a22, b1 and b2 are constant coefficients, and x and y
are the ‘unknowns’. We can determine the unknowns using
elementary algebra as follows:
N
Multiply eqn (10.1) by a22 and eqn (10.2) by a12 to give:
a11a22xza12a22y~b1a22
ð10:3Þ
a12a21xza12a22y~b2a12
ð10:4Þ
N
Subtract eqn (10.4) from eqn (10.3) to yield:
a11a22{a12a21
ð
Þx~b1a22{b2a12,
which we can rearrange to give an expression for x in terms of the
constant coefficients:
x~ b1a22{b2a12
a11a22{a12a21
ð10:5Þ
N
Now, multiply eqn (10.1) by a21 and eqn (10.2) by a11, and
subtract the resulting equations to give an analogous expression
for y
y~ b2a11{b1a21
a11a22{a12a21
ð10:6Þ
The denominators in eqns (10.5) and (10.6) are the same, and can be
written alternatively as:
a11
a12
a21
a22

~a11a22{a12a21
ð10:7Þ
The symbol on the left side of eqn (10.7) defines a determinant of
order 2, the value of which is given on the right. We can similarly
express the numerators as determinants of order 2, and we see that the
220

value of the two unknowns is then given by the ratio of two
determinants:
x~

ð10:8Þ
The purpose of introducing this notation is that it readily extends to
n linear algebraic equations in n unknowns. The problem then reduces
to one of evaluating the respective determinants of order n.
Problem 10.1
Solve the following simultaneous equations for x and y, by eva-
luating the appropriate determinants according to eqn (10.8).
2xzy~5
ð10:9Þ

ð10:10Þ
Hint: You will need to associate each of the coefficients a11, a12,
a21, a22, b1 and b2 in eqns (10.1) and (10.2) with those in eqns
(10.9) and (10.10).
This type of problem arises in a chemical context quite frequently. For
example, the activation energy of a chemical reaction can be
determined by measuring the rate constant for a particular reaction
at two different temperatures. The relationship between rate constant
and temperature is given by the Arrhenius equation:
k~Ae{Ea=RT
ð10:11Þ
where Ea is the activation energy for the reaction, and A is the so-
called pre-exponential factor. We can convert the Arrhenius equation
to linear form by taking logs of both sides:
ln k~ln A{ Ea
RT :
ð10:12Þ
If we now measure the rate constant at two different temperatures,
T1 and T2, we obtain a pair of simultaneous linear equations, which
we can solve for the two unknowns, Ea and lnA:

Problem 10.2
(a) By analogy with eqns (10.1) and (10.2), identify which terms
in eqns (10.13) and (10.14) correlate with the constant
coefficients a11, a12, a21, a22, b1 and b2, and which terms
correlate with the unknowns, x and y.
(b) If the temperatures on the Farenheit and Centigrade scales
are T and t, respectively, we can express the relationship
between the two as T 5 at + b, where a and b are unknowns.
By analogy with eqns (10.1) and (10.2), use the method of
determinants to obtain the values of a and b by using the
boiling and freezing points of water on the two temperature
scales. Hence find the formula relating T to t.
Hint: The boiling and freezing points of water on the Farenheit
scale are Tb 5 212 uF and Tf 5 32 uF .
10.2 Expanding Determinants
In general, a determinant of order n is defined as a square array of n2
elements arranged in n rows and n columns:

The elements of this determinant are denoted by aij or bij, where i
denotes the row and j the column number. Note that the letter used
commonly derives from the label applied to a related square matrix –
a consequence of the common definition of a determinant as an
operation on a square matrix (see Section 11.1). We have seen above
in eqn (10.7) that a determinant of order 2 is evaluated in terms of the
elements aij which lie at the intersection of the ith row with the jth
column of the determinant.
222

A determinant of order 3, which might result from a problem
involving three simultaneous equations in three unknowns, is
evaluated by expanding as follows:

ð10:16Þ
This expansion proceeds by taking the elements of the first row in
turn, and multiplying each one by the determinant of what remains on
crossing out the row and column containing the chosen element, and
then attaching the sign (21)i+j. The signed determinants of order 2
in eqn (10.16) are known as the first order cofactors A11, A12 and A13
of the three elements a11, a12 and a13, respectively.
In general, the n2 cofactors of any determinant of order n are
obtained by deleting one row and one column to form a determinant of
order n21, the value of which is multiplied by an odd or even power of
21, depending upon the choice of row index and column index. Thus, if
the ith row and jth column of a determinant of order n are both deleted,
then the ijth cofactor, Aij, is formed from the value of the resulting
determinant of order n21, multiplied by (21)i+j. For example, the
cofactor A12 of the determinant of order 3 in eqn (10.16) is obtained by
deleting the first row and the second column of the determinant, and
multiplying the resulting determinant of order 2 by (21)1+2:

If we now expand each of the cofactors (all determinants of order 2)
according to eqn (10.7), we obtain the full expansion of the
determinant, given in eqn (10.20), expressed as a sum of three
positive and three negative terms:

ð10:20Þ
In this example, the determinant is initially expanded from the first
row but, in fact, we could just as easily expand from any row or
column. Thus, for example, expanding from column two gives the
alternative expansion:

Expanding each of the determinants of order 2 in eqn (10.22) yields
eqn (10.20), but with the six terms on the right in a different order.
A slightly quicker route to ensuring the correct signs in the sum of
the cofactor values is obtained by remembering the general rule for

column) to give a new determinant, the value of which when
multiplied by the factor gives the original value of the
determinant. For example:

Here, the factor 2 has been removed from column 2. Conversely,
when a determinant is multiplied by a constant, the constant can
be absorbed into the determinant by multiplying the elements of
one row (or column) by that constant.

The value of a determinant is unaltered if a constant multiple of
one row or column is added to or subtracted from another row
or column, respectively: for example, if we subtract twice column

10.4 Strategies for Expanding Determinants Where n . 3
We can take a number of different approaches for evaluating
determinants of higher order:
(a)
For determinants of order 3 or lower, it is easiest to expand in
full from the row or column containing the greatest number of
zeros (for example, see Problem 10.3).
A determinant can only have
a value if the elements are
numbers.
226
Maths for Chemists

(b)
For determinants of order 4 to about 6, it is best to introduce as
many zeros as possible to the right (or left) of the leading
diagonal using properties (1) – (4) (Section 10.3). If all the
elements to the right or left of the leading diagonal are zero,
then:

~a11a22a33    ann,
ð10:28Þ
and the expansion of the determinant is given by the product of
the elements lying on the leading diagonal.
(c)
When expanding determinants of high order (n . 5), it is much
more convenient to use one of the widely available computer
algebra systems (Maple, Mathematica, etc.) or a numerical
computer algorithm. There are many chemical situations in
which we have to expand determinants of large order. For
example, in computing the vibrational frequencies of ethene, it is
necessary to expand a determinant of order 12 (for a non-linear
molecule containing N nuclei, the order will be 3N – 6).

elements to the right of the leading diagonal to zero,
before expanding from row 1.

where the symbols a and b are parameters (both negative in

(a) Use property (3) of determinants to remove a factor of b
from each row (or column) of the determinant shown in
eqn (10.29).
Hint: Division of each element in one row or column by b results
in a new determinant, the value of which is multiplied by b.
Thus division of every element in the determinant results in a
new determinant, the value of which is multiplied by b3.
(b) Show that, on making the substitution x 5 (a 2 e) / b, the
expansion of the determinant yields x3 2 2x 5 0.

Find the three roots of this equation.

Matrices and Matrix Algebra
In the previous chapter, we saw how determinants are used to tackle
problems involving the solution of systems of linear equations. In
general, the branch of mathematics which deals with linear systems is
known as linear algebra, in which matrices and vectors play a
dominant role. In this chapter we shall explore how matrices and
matrix algebra are used to address problems involving coordinate
transformations, as well as revisiting the solution of sets of
simultaneous linear equations. Vectors are explored in Chapter 12.
Matrices are two-dimensional arrays (or tables) with specific shapes
and properties:

Their key property is that they give us a formalism for system-
atically handling sets of objects – called elements – which, for
example, can be numbers, chemical property values, algebraic
quantities or integrals. Superficially, matrices resemble determinants,
insofar as they are constructed from arrays of elements. However, as
we shall see, they are really quite distinct from one another. The most
important difference is that while a determinant expands to yield an
expression (and a value, when its elements are numbers), a matrix
does not.
Aims:
In this chapter we develop matrix algebra from two key
perspectives: one makes use of matrices to facilitate the handling
of coordinate transformations, in preparation for a develop-
ment of symmetry theory; the other revisits determinants, and
through the definition of the matrix inverse, provides a means
for solving sets of linear equations.

nant.

11.1 Introduction: Some Definitions
A matrix is an array of elements, comprising n rows and m columns,
enclosed in parentheses (round brackets). By convention, matrices are
named using bold typeface letters of upper or lower case, such as A or
b, so we could, for example, label the matrices above as:

ð
Þ:
The elements of the matrix are usually denoted aij or bij (depending
on the letter used to label the matrix itself), where i denotes the row
and j the column number. Thus, for example, the matrix B above has
two rows and two columns, and is said to be a 262 matrix; however,
as the matrix is square, it is commonly named a square matrix of order
two, with elements assigned as follows:
b11~2, b12~{1, b21~0, b22~3:
Sometimes, it is more convenient to use the notation (B)ij to
indicate the ijth element of matrix B. Similarly, the 361 matrix c is
called a column matrix, and the 163 matrix d is called a row matrix.
The general matrix, A, having order (n6m) is called a rectangular
matrix with elements:

11.2 Rules for Combining Matrices
In this section, we explore the matrix analogues of addition,
subtraction and multiplication of numbers. The analogue for division
(the inverse operation of multiplication) has no direct counterpart for
matrices.
11.2.1 Multiplication of a Matrix by a Constant
The multiplication of a matrix, A, by a constant c (a real, imaginary
or complex number), is achieved by simply multiplying each element
by the constant, resulting in the elements changing from aij to c aij, for
all i, j.

elements in row i of A with those in column j of B (Figure 11.1):

A number of features relating to matrix multiplication are worthy

If the number of columns in A is not equal to the number of rows
in B, then multiplication is undefined.

In general, even if AB is defined, then BA may not be defined.
N
If AB and BA are both defined, their orders may differ.
N
Even if AB and BA have the same order, the two product matrices
may not be equal. In these circumstances, matrix multiplication is
non-commutative, i.e. AB ? BA.

11.3 Origins of Matrices
11.3.1 Coordinate Transformations
Matrices have their origin in coordinate transformations, where, in two
dimensions, for example, a chosen point, with coordinates (x, y), is
transformed to a new location with coordinates (x9, y9). For example,
consider an anticlockwise rotation of the point P in the xy-plane,
about the z-axis, through an angle h, as shown in Figure 11.2.
We can use simple trigonometry to relate the coordinates of Q to
those of P by expressing the Cartesian coordinates in terms of polar
coordinates. Thus the (x, y) coordinates of point P become:
x~r cos a and y~r sin a,
ð11:7Þ
and those of point Q become:
x’~r cos hza
ð
Þ and y’~r sin hza
ð
Þ:
ð11:8Þ
If we now use the addition theorems for cosine and sine (see Section
2.3.3), we obtain the expansions:
x’~r cos hza

~r cos h cos a{r sin h sin a
~x cos h{y sin h;

which allows us to express the coordinates of Q (x9, y9) in terms of
those of P (x, y).
x’~x cos h{y sin h
y’~x sin hzy cos h
	
ð11:11Þ
Eqn (11.11) describes the transformation of coordinates under an
anticlockwise rotation by an angle, h. This coordinate transformation
is completely characterised by a square matrix, A, with elements cos h
and ¡sin h, and the column matrices, r, and r9, involving the initial
and final coordinates, respectively:

single matrix eqn (11.13):

Since r9 and Ar are both 261 matrices, we can equate the elements in
r9 with those in Ar, to restore the original equations, which confirms
eqn (11.13) as the correct matrix representation of eqns (11.11).
Worked Problem 11.3
Consider the coordinate transformation involving reflection in
the y-axis (Figure 11.3). We can see that this transformation
simply involves a change in sign of x, with the value of y
remaining unchanged. Thus the transformed point, Q, will have
coordinates (x9, y9) 5 (2x, y).
Working with Arrays II: Matrices and Matrix Algebra
237

We can represent this transformation in terms of a matrix
equation r9 5 Cr, where C is a 262 matrix characterising
reflection in the y-axis, and r and r9 are the column matrices
containing the initial and final coordinates, respectively.
Q. Show that the matrix C characterising reflection in the y-axis

11.3.1.1 Sequential Coordinate Transformations
The effect of applying two sequential coordinate transformations on a
point, r, can be represented by the product of the two matrices, each
one of which represents the respective transformation. We need to take
care, however, that the matrices are multiplied in the correct order
because, as we saw above, matrix multiplication is often non-
commutative. For example, in order to find the matrix representing
an anticlockwise rotation by h, followed by a reflection in the y-axis, we
need to find the product CA (and not AC as we might initially assume).
Problem 11.5
(a) Find the matrix, D, describing the coordinate transforma-
tion resulting from reflection in the line y 5 x.
(i)
Find the matrix, E, describing the coordinate trans-
formation resulting from a reflection in the line y5 x,
followed by a reflection in the y-axis (see Worked Problem
11.3).
(ii) Find the matrix, F, describing the coordinate trans-
formation that results from a reflection in the y-axis
followed by a reflection in the line y 5 x.
In each case check your answer graphically, by using the
matrices E and F to transform the coordinates (1, 2) to their new
location (x0, y0).
11.3.2 Coordinate Transformations in Three Dimensions: A Chemical
Example
In preparation for the discussion of group theory in Section 11.9, let
us consider how we might use matrix representations of coordinate
transformations to characterise the shape of a molecule – something
of vital importance, for example, in describing the vibrational
motions in a molecule. In order to accomplish this objective, we
need to consider only those linear transformations in three dimen-
sions that interchange equivalent points in a molecule. One example
of such a transformation involves the interchange of coordinates
defining the positions of two fluorine nuclei in the planar molecule
BF3. We can achieve this result by extending the rotation and
(b)
Working with Arrays II: Matrices and Matrix Algebra
239

reflection coordinate transformations in Figures 11.2 and 11.3 to
three dimensions. For BF3, there are four mirror planes but, for the
moment, let us focus only on the yz mirror plane, which is
perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, and contains the boron
and the fluorine nucleus F1 (Figure 11.4).
The matrix C, defined in Worked Problem 11.3, describes reflection
in the y-axis of a point defined by the two coordinates (x, y). We can
rewrite matrix C in terms of all three coordinates as follows:
x’
y’
z’

ð11:15Þ
where we note that the z-coordinate is unchanged by the coordinate
transformation. Thus, a reflection in the yz-plane interchanges points
located at the nuclei F2 and F3.
If we now rotate an arbitrary point (x, y, z) about the z-axis, the x
and y coordinates are transformed according to matrix A, defined in
eqn (11.12), but the z coordinate is unchanged: thus:
Figure 11.4
The nuclear
configuration for BF3 in the
xy-plane. The z-axis is
perpendicular to the paper, and
passes through B. Three of the
mirror planes are perpendicular to
the paper, and contain the boron
and one of the fluorine nuclei,
respectively. The fourth mirror
plane lies in the plane of the
molecule and contains all of the
nuclei.

An anticlockwise rotation of h 5 2p/3 (equivalent to 120u) about the
z-axis described in eqn (11.16) transforms a point located at either F1 ,
F2 or F3 to an equivalent point located at F2 , F3 or F1, respectively.
The important point here is that if the coordinates of points are
represented in matrix form, then the geometrical actions involved in
carrying out a rotation or reflection may also be represented by
matrices, which enables us to mimic problems in geometry using
matrix algebra; that is, geometrical operations on points can be
replaced by matrix representations acting on column matrices
containing the coordinates of points. We shall re-visit these ideas in
Section 11.9, where we develop a brief introduction to the principles
of symmetry theory.

Given an n6m matrix B, we can construct its transpose, BT, by
interchanging the rows and columns. Thus the ijth element of B
becomes the jith element of BT according to:

11.4.2 The Complex Conjugate Matrix
Taking the complex conjugate of every element of a matrix, A, yields
the complex conjugate matrix, A*: that is, (A*)ij 5 (A)ij*. If all the
elements of A are real, then A* 5 A.

11.4.5 The Matrix of Cofactors
The cofactor of a determinant, which we first defined in Section 10.2,
is characterised by a row and column index, in much the same way as
we characterise the elements in a matrix. Thus, we can form the
matrix of cofactors by accommodating each cofactor in its appro-
priate position. For example, the determinant:
det A~ a11
a12
a21
a22


ð11:20Þ
gives rise to the four cofactors A11, A12, A21 and A22, which may be
collected together in the matrix of cofactors, B:

We now return to a further discussion of some special matrices that
arise in a chemical context.
11.6 Special Matrices
So far, we have met matrices of different orders, but we have not been
concerned with the properties of their constituent elements. In this
section, we introduce the null and unit matrices, and then present a
catalogue of important kinds of matrix that are common in
developing mathematical models used, for example, in the calculation
of vibrational frequencies of molecules, distributions of electron
density and other observable properties of molecules.
11.6.1 The Null Matrix
The general null matrix is an n by m matrix, all of whose elements are
zero. If the matrix is:
N
Rectangular, it is named as Onm.
N
Square (n 5 m) it is named as On
244

N
A column matrix, it is named On1 or more commonly and simply
as O.
Given an m6n matrix X,
OnmXmn~On,
XmnOnm~Om:
ð11:23Þ
11.6.2 The Unit Matrix
The unit matrix is a square matrix of order n, denoted here by En
whose leading diagonal elements are all unity (i.e. have value 1), and
whose off-diagonal elements are zero. Thus, for example:
E2~

specified using the Kronecker delta, which is written as:

1,
for i~j
0,
for i=j

ð11:25Þ
where i 5 j designates a diagonal position and i ? j a non-diagonal
position.
As En is an n6n matrix, EnA (pre-multiplication of A by En) is
equal to A if A has order (n6p); likewise AEn (post-multiplication of
A by En) yields A if A has order (p6n).

11.7 Matrices with Special Properties
11.7.1 Symmetric Matrices
A square matrix, A, is said to be symmetric if it has the property
(A)ij 5 (A)ji: that is,
A~AT:
ð11:26Þ
For example, the following matrix is symmetric:

as reflection in the leading diagonal leaves the array of elements
unchanged in appearance.
For any n by m matrix X, both XTX and XXT are symmetric
matrices.
11.7.2 Orthogonal Matrices
An orthogonal matrix, A, is a square matrix of order n with the
property
ATA~AAT~En:
ð11:27Þ
It follows from Property (1) of determinants (see Section 10.3), that
detA 5 detAT, since the value of a determinant is unchanged if all
246

columns and rows are interchanged. It also follows from eqn (11.22)
that det(AAT) 5 det A 6 det A 5 (det A)2 and from the property of
an orthogonal matrix given in eqn (11.27) that (det A)2 5 detEn 5 1.
Consequently, since (detA)2 5 1, it follows that, for an orthogonal
matrix, detA 5 ¡1. However, it does not necessarily follow that an
arbitrary matrix satisfying this criterion is orthogonal, since it must
also satisfy eqn (11.27).

satisfies the condition detA 5 ¡1. Check your answer
against eqn (11.27) and comment on whether the matrix A
is orthogonal or not.
As we shall see in later Sections, orthogonal matrices play an
important role in defining the coordinate transformations that are
used in characterising the symmetry properties of molecules.
11.7.3 Singular Matrices
A square matrix, A, for which detA 5 0, is said to be singular. Such
matrices usually arise when the number of variables (or degrees of
freedom) is over-specified for the chosen model, as would occur, for
example, in:
N
Using the same atomic orbital twice in constructing molecular
orbitals in the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) model,
N
Solving an inconsistent set of equations.
Superficially, using the same
atomic orbital twice in construct-
ing molecular orbitals using the
LCAO method may seem mis-
guided. However, there are cases
when the second occurrence of
the atomic orbital is disguised.

11.7.4 Hermitian Matrices
A complex square matrix, that is equal to the transpose of its complex
conjugate, is called an Hermitian matrix, which is:
A~A{:

11.7.5 Unitary Matrices
A square matrix U, of order n, is said to be unitary if :
U{U~UU{~En
ð11:29Þ
It follows from the definition of a unitary matrix that detU 5¡1.
As for orthogonal matrices, an arbitrary matrix having the property
detU 5 ¡1, is unitary only if the requirements of eqn (11.29) are
satisfied.
Hermitian and unitary matrices play the same role for matrices with
complex elements that symmetric and orthogonal matrices do for
matrices with real elements. These features are summarised in Table 11.1:

11.7.6 The Inverse Matrix
The inverse of a square matrix A, of order n is written A21, has the
property:
AA
{1~A{1A~En:
ð11:30Þ
and exists only if detA ? 0. If detA 5 0 then A is singular and A21
does not exist. We saw in Problem 11.12(a) that the transposed matrix
of cofactors, BT is related to A and detA – irrespective of the order of
A – according to the formula:
BTA~En detA:
ð11:31Þ
Rearranging eqn (11.31) gives:

which provides us with a formula for obtaining A21 from BT and

non-singular.

11.8 Solving Sets of Linear Equations
Suppose we have a set of three equations, each of which is linear in the
unknowns x1, x2, x3:
a11x1za12x2za13x3~b1
a21x1za22x2za23x3~b2
a31x1za32x2za33x3~b3
ð11:34Þ
where the aij and bi (i, j 5 1, 2, 3) are constant coefficients. If all the bi
are zero, then the equations are called homogeneous but, if one or
more of the bi are non-zero, then the equations are called
inhomogeneous.
We can write the three linear eqns (11.34) as a single matrix
equation:

and then check that eqns (11.35) and (11.34) are equivalent, by
evaluating the matrix product in the left side of eqn (11.35) to give:

(11.35) in a more compact form as:

and pre-multiply by A21, the matrix inverse of A, we obtain:

Find the values of x, y, z that satisfy the equations:

So far we have considered only the solutions to sets of inhomoge-
neous linear equations where at least one of the bi is non-zero. If,
however, we have a set of homogeneous equations, where all of the bi
are zero, then we may define two further possible limiting cases:
N
If detA ? 0, and b 5 0 (all bi are zero), then this approach will
only ever yield the solution, x 5 0, i.e. x1 5 x2 5 x3 5 0 since x 5
A210 5 0.
N
If detA 5 0, and b 5 0, then, again, A21 will be undefined.
However, although the solution may yield the so-called trivial
result x 5 0, other solutions may also exist.
11.8.1 Solution of Linear Equations: A Chemical Example
In Problem 10.6, we saw how the molecular orbital energies for the
allyl system are determined from the solution of a determinantal
equation. At this point, we are now in the position to understand the
origin of this equation.
In the Hu¨ckel model, the result of minimising the energy of the
appropriately occupied p molecular orbitals results in the following
set of linear equations in the unknown atomic orbital coefficients, cr,
together with the molecular orbital energy, e:

or in more compact form as Ac 5 0, where 0 is a null column matrix.
Eqns (11.41) provide an example of a set of homogeneous equations,
because the right side constant coefficients, equivalent to bi in eqn
(11.34), are all zero [and hence the appearance of the null column
matrix 0 in the equivalent matrix eqn (11.42)]. The trivial solution to
eqn (11.42), where c1 5 c2 5 c3 5 0 (c 5 0) is of no physical
significance, as the molecular orbitals do not then exist – another
example of how important it is to use physical intuition to interpret
the significance of a mathematical result! A more detailed study of the
mathematics indicates that eqn (11.42) has a non-trivial solution if

11.9 Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory
One of the key applications of matrices in chemistry is in the
characterisation of molecular symmetry. In Section 11.3, we saw how
it was possible to represent the coordinate transformations associated
with rotation and reflection in terms of matrices. These notions are
now explored in the next Section, where we develop some of the basic
ideas of group theory.
11.9.1 An Introduction to Group Theory
A group consists of a set of elements (e.g. numbers or square
matrices), for which there is a specified mode of combination (for
example, addition, subtraction or multiplication), subject to the four
following requirements:
254
Maths for Chemists

(a) For any R, S in the set, the combination RS is a member of the

(b) For any R, S and T in the set, the mode of combination must be

the set, RE 5 ER 5 R;

The number of elements in the group is termed its order, which may be
finite or infinite.
Worked Problem 11.7
Q. Investigate whether the set of integers forms a group under
each of the following modes of combination: (a) addition, (b)
subtraction and (c) multiplication.
A.
(a) Addition: the sum of any two integers is an integer (closure
satisfied); addition of integers is associative; the identity
element is zero (e.g. 2 + 0 5 0 + 2 5 2); the inverse of any
integer n is 2n [e.g. 2 + (22) 5 0, the identity element], and 2n
is an integer which is in the set. Since all four criteria are
satisfied, the set of integers forms a group of infinite order
under addition.
(b) Subtraction: the difference of any two integers is an integer
(closure satisfied); subtraction of integers is not associative,
e.g. (3 2 4) 2 2 5 23, while 3 2 (4 2 2) 5 1, and so the set
of integers does not form a group under subtraction.
(c)
Multiplication: the product of any two integers is an integer
(closure satisfied); multiplication is associative; the inverse
of any non-zero integer n is the rational number 1 / n which
is not an integer and so the set of integers does not form a
group under multiplication.
Problem 11.19
Demonstrate that the set of numbers G1 5 {1, 21, i, 2i} forms
a group of order 4 under multiplication.
The elements of a group should
not to be confused with the
elements of a matrix or

11.9.2 Groups of Matrices
Groups of non-singular (square) matrices are of special interest in
chemistry, because they are used to characterise molecular and solid
state structures according to their symmetry properties. This is vital
when determining:
N
Whether spectroscopic transitions of all kinds are forbidden or
allowed.
N
The most likely mechanisms of some classes of organic reaction,
where symmetry controls the outcome.
N
The arrangement of species in the unit cell of solid state structures.
When deciding whether a given set of matrices of order n forms a
group under multiplication, we can disregard associativity as one of
the criteria because multiplication of matrices is always necessarily
associative – and so we only need to check for closure, the presence of
En and identify all inverses.
Worked Problem 11.8
Let us consider, as an example, the set, G3, of the following
three matrices of order 2 to see whether they form a group
under multiplication:

The best way of checking the group requirements is to
construct the multiplication table as shown in Table 11.2:
We can see that this set of matrices forms a group, as:
1. The set is closed under multiplication;
2. B is the inverse of C, and vice versa;
3. A is the identity element, which is its own inverse.

11.9.3 Group Theory in Chemistry
Molecules are classified in terms of their symmetry properties by
constructing groups of matrices that describe coordinate transforma-
tions, resulting in the interchange of chemically equivalent points. For
any given molecule, these coordinate transformations form the
elements of a particular point group that describes its symmetry
properties.
For example, the water molecule is bent in its ground state, with a
bond angle of approximately 105u (see Figure 11.5). If we rotate an
initial point lying above the plane of the molecule, directly over one of
the hydrogen nuclei through 180u about the principal axis passing
through the oxygen nucleus in the molecular plane (the z-axis in
Figure 11.5), the transformed point will lie below the other hydrogen
nucleus. Likewise, reflection in the plane perpendicular to the
molecular plane, and containing the principal axis of rotation (the
xz-plane), transforms the initial point to an equivalent point lying
above the other hydrogen nucleus. However, reflection in the plane of
the molecule (the yz-plane) transforms the initial point to one lying
directly below the original hydrogen nucleus. Clearly, the identity
Point groups are so called
because there is always one point
that is unmoved under every
symmetry operation. This is not
the case in space groups that
are used to characterise the
symmetry properties of crystals.
Working with Arrays II: Matrices and Matrix Algebra
257

operation leaves the initial point unmoved. These three symmetry
operations are known as the C2 , sv and sv9, respectively, and together
with the identity element, E, constitute the four elements of the C2v
point group to which water belongs.
If the location of one of the nuclei is taken as the initial point, then we
see that each symmetry operation just exchanges (or leaves unmoved)
the coordinates of chemically equivalent nuclei. It transpires that if we
follow the procedure of physically moving the nuclei, rather than a
representative point in space, then each matrix generated is the inverse
of the one associated with the appropriate coordinate transformation
although the traces of the respective matrices are the same. This is
helpful because in most applications of group theory, we work with the
traces rather than the elements of the transformation matrices.
Problem 11.21
How many symmetry operations can you list that interchange
chemically equivalent nuclei in the planar molecule, BF3 (see
Section 11.3.2)?
Hint: How many mirror planes and axes of rotation are there?

configuration for H2O in the yz-
plane. The x-axis is perpendicular
to the paper, and passes through
O. One of the two mirror planes
lies in the plane of the paper,
whilst the second is perpendicular
to the paper and contains the O
atom. The principal axis of
rotation is the z-axis.
In the context of group theory the
trace of a matrix is usually
referred to as the character.

Vectors
Many of the physical quantities which we deal with from day to day,
such as mass, temperature or concentration, require only a single
number (with appropriate units) to specify their value. Such quantities
are called scalar quantities, specified exclusively in terms of their
value. However, we frequently encounter other quantities, called
vectors, which require us to specify a magnitude (a positive value), and
a direction. Velocity is an example of a vector quantity, whereas speed
is a scalar quantity (in fact speed defines the magnitude of velocity).
This is why we say that an object travelling on a circular path, with
constant speed (such as an electron orbiting a nucleus in the Bohr
model of the atom) is accelerating: its velocity changes with time
because its direction is constantly changing, in spite of the fact that
the speed is constant (see Figure 12.1).
In the example shown in Figure 12.1, we define both the position
and velocity in terms of vectors: The position of the electron at any
given time is given by a position vector, referenced to an origin O. So,
when the electron is at point P, its location is defined by the vector a,
whereas when it has moved to point Q, the position is defined by a
different position vector, b. We can also represent the velocity at
points P and Q by the two vectors va and vb, both of which have the
same magnitude (length) but whose direction is different.
In chemistry, we meet many physical quantities and properties that
require us to specify both magnitude and direction. These include:

position vectors of an electron at

The magnetic and electrical properties of atoms, molecules and
solids.
N
Forces between molecules.
N
Velocity of a molecule in the gas phase.
N
Angular momentum associated with molecular rotational motion
and with the orbital and spin motions of electrons.
In order to qualify properly as a vector, a quantity must obey the
rules of vector algebra (scalar quantities obey the rules of arithmetic).
Consequently, we need to describe and define these rules before we
can solve problems in chemistry involving vector quantities. Linear
algebra is the field of mathematics that provides us with the notation
and rules required to work with directional quantities.
Aims:
In this chapter, we discuss the concept of the vector from a
number of perspectives, ranging from the graphical description,
to a presentation of vector algebra and on to examples of how
we can apply vector algebra to specific chemical problems
involving directional properties. By the end of the chapter, you
should understand how:
N
Vectors are defined geometrically in terms of direction and
magnitude.
N
Vectors are defined algebraically, using base vectors.
N
Vectors are combined using addition or subtraction.
N
The scalar and vector products are defined and used.
N
The triple scalar product is defined and used for calculating
the volume of a parallelepiped.
N
Matrix representatives of vectors are formulated and used.
12.1 The Geometric Construction of Vectors
A vector is represented mathematically by a directed line segment, the
length of which corresponds to the magnitude of the vector, whilst its
orientation, taken together with an attached arrow, indicates its
direction. To simplify matters, we first consider vectors in two
dimensions (2-D space), and then extend the concepts to dealing with
vectors in three or more dimensions.
Vectors
261

12.1.1 Vectors in Two Dimensions
Consider the three directed line segments representing the vectors
shown in Figure 12.2: all three have initial and final points, which
may or may not be labelled, whereas the arrow indicates the direction.
In each case the position of the initial point is of no significance. The
magnitudes (lengths) of the left-most and right-most vectors are the
same, but their directions are opposite; the middle vector has the same
direction as the left vector, but twice its magnitude.
12.1.2 Conventions
1.
Vectors are represented by symbols such as a, b, ... and their
respective magnitudes are given by |a|, |b|, ..., or just a, b, .... An
alternative notation, OP
!, is sometimes used when we wish to
describe a displacement in space between two points (in this case,
points O and P).
2.
The vectors a and b are said to be equal if their magnitudes and
directions are the same – irrespective of the locations of their
initial points. Hence, any directed line segment with the same
length and direction as a is represented by a.
3.
A unit vector is a vector having unit magnitude (or length). Unit
vectors are symbolised by ^a, ^b,…, and correspond to the vectors
a, b,… divided by their own magnitude. For example:
^a~ a
aj j :
ð12:1Þ
4.
A null vector, 0, has zero magnitude and consequently no
direction is defined.
12.2 Addition and Subtraction of Vectors
12.2.1 Vector Addition
Consider the two vectors a and b shown in Figure 12.3.
The arrow indicating direction is
placed at any appropriate point
on the line segment. We have
chosen for the most part to place
the arrow at the mid point.

the vectors a, 2a and 2a as

Maths for Chemists

The sum of a and b is given by the vector c, which is found in the
following series of steps:
(a) Translate the vector b until its initial point coincides with that
of a:
(b) Construct a parallelogram as indicated in Figure 12.4.
The directed line segment OQ
! represents the vector c, defined as the
sum of a and b. Furthermore, as OQ
!~OP
!zPQ
!~OR
!zRQ
!, it
follows that c 5 a + b 5 b + a, from which we see that addition is
commutative; in other words, a displacement OR
! followed by RQ
!
clearly leads to the same final point as a displacement OP
! followed by
PQ
!.
Since OR
! and PQ
! are equivalent, and represent the same vector b,
we can use a triangle to summarise the relationship between a, b and
the resultant vector c (see Figure 12.5). For this reason, the equality c
5 a + b is often known as the triangle rule.
12.2.2 Vector Subtraction
The subtraction of two vectors can be thought of as the addition of
two vectors that differ in their sign. If we think of this in terms of
Figure 12.3
Vectors a and b
with initial points O and S,
respectively.

Vectors

displacements in space, then the first vector corresponds to a
displacement from point P to point Q, for example, whereas a second
identical vector with opposite sign will direct us back to point P from
point Q.
The net result is the null vector – we end up where we started.
az{a~a{a~0
ð12:2Þ
It follows that subtraction of two vectors, a and b, is equivalent to
adding the vectors a and 2b, and so we can define vector subtraction
in a general sense as:
d~az {b
ð
Þ~a{b,
ð12:3Þ
which can be expressed in terms of a variant of the triangle rule, as
seen in Figure 12.6.
It also follows from Figure 12.6, that if a + b 5 c then c 2 a 5 b,
which we represent graphically in two ways in Figure 12.7:
Note that both representations are equivalent, in spite of the fact
that the initial and final points of vector b are located at different
points in space in the two representations. Thus, since the vector is
fully defined simply by its direction and magnitude, the locations of
the initial and final points are unimportant – unless we define them to
act in specific locations.

Problem 12.1
Use the vectors a and b in Figure 12.5 to construct parallelo-
grams, defined by the vectors: (a) c 5 a + 2b and (b) d 5 2a 2 b.
12.3 Base Vectors
Any kind of operation on a vector, including addition and
subtraction, can be somewhat laborious when working with its
graphical representation. However, by referring the vectors to a
common set of unit vectors, termed base vectors, we can reduce the
manipulations of vectors to algebraic operations.
In three dimensional space, a convenient set of three unit vectors is
provided by^i,^j, ^k, which are directed along the x-, y-, and z-Cartesian
axes, respectively (Figure 12.8).
In this system of coordinates, if a point P has the coordinates (x, y,
z), then the directed line segment OP
!, extending from the origin O to
point P, corresponds to the vector r. If we apply the triangle rule
twice, we obtain:

r~x^izy^jzz^k
ð12:6Þ
Eqn (12.6) expresses r as a sum of the vectors x^i, y^j and z^k, which
are called the projections of r in the direction of the x-, y- and z-axes.
The magnitudes of each projection are given by the x-, y- and z-
values, respectively, defining the location of P; however, in the context

Base vectors in
three dimensions for the
Cartesian coordinate system.
Vectors
265

of vectors, these values (coordinates) are known as the components of
r; if the components are all zero, then this defines the null vector. Note
that for problems in two dimensions, only two base vectors are
required, such as, for example ^i and ^j.
12.3.1 The Magnitude of a Vector in Three-Dimensional Space
If we apply the Pythagoras’ Theorem, first to triangle ORQ in
Figure 12.8, and then to triangle OQP, we obtain an expression for
the magnitude of r in terms of its components:

12.3.2 Vector Addition, Subtraction and Scalar Multiplication using
Algebra
The algebraic approach to vector addition and subtraction simply
involves adding or subtracting the respective projections, x^i, y^j and
z^k, of the two (or more) vectors. Scalar multiplication requires each
projection to be multiplied by the scalar quantity.

12.4 Multiplication of Vectors
In algebra, as we saw in Chapter 2, the act of multiplication is an
unambiguous and well-defined operation indicated by the sign 6. In
the algebra of vectors, however, multiplication and division have no
obvious conventional meaning. Despite this drawback, the two kinds
of multiplication operation on pairs of vectors in widespread use are
defined in the following subsections.
12.4.1 Scalar Product of Two Vectors
Consider the vectors a and b in Figure 12.10, in which the angle
between the two vectors is h:

Objects formed by placing
vectors in juxtaposition, such as
ab, are called dyadics and have a
role in theoretical aspects of
Raman spectroscopy, for
example.
Vectors
267

The scalar product is defined as:
a:b~b:a~ aj j bj j cosh:
ð12:8Þ
The right-hand side of eqn (12.8) indicates that the result is a scalar
(number), and not another vector, because it involves the product of
the magnitudes of the two vectors, with the cosine of the angle
between them (a positive or negative number, depending on the
angle). Thus, since |a| and |b| are, by definition positive numbers, the
sign of the scalar product is determined by the value of the angle h. In
particular, the scalar product is:
N
Positive, for an acute angle (h , 90u).
N
Zero for h 5 90u.
N
Negative for an obtuse angle (90u , h ¡ 180u).
By convention, the h angle is restricted to the range 0 ¡ h ¡ 180u.
If h 5 90u, then a?b 5 0, and a and b are said to be orthogonal. On the
other hand, the scalar product of a vector with itself (h 5 0u; cos h 5
1), yields the square of its magnitude:
a:a~ aj j2, implying that aj j~
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a:a
p
:
ð12:9Þ
Furthermore, if a is of unit magnitude, then a?a 5 1, and a is then said
to be normalised.
12.4.1.1 Specifying the Angle h
In some situations, it is important to be aware of how the sense of
direction of the two vectors a and b affects the choice for the value of
the angle between them. For example, the angle h between the vectors
in Figure 12.10 constitutes the correct choice, because the two vectors
are directed away from the common point of origin. However, if
vector a (or vector b) is directed in the opposite sense (the dashed
directed line segment in Figure 12.11), then we determine the angle
between a and b by realigning the two vectors to ensure once again
that they are directed away from the common origin point. The angle
is then defined as 180u 2 h (Figure 12.11).

12.4.1.2 The Scalar Product in the Chemical Context
Scalar products arise in a number of important areas in chemistry.
For example, they are involved in:
N
Determining the energy, W, of a molecular electric or magnetic
dipole interacting with an electric or magnetic field , W 5 2me?E,
or W 5 2mm?H, respectively.
N
Evaluating the consequences of the intermolecular dipole–dipole
interactions in crystalline substances.
N

is used to evaluate the volume of a crystallographic unit cell.
12.4.1.3 Scalar Products of Vectors Expressed in Terms of Base
Vectors
The scalar product of two vectors a and b, expressed in terms of
base vectors, is obtained by taking the sum of the scalar products
of each base vector pair, together with the appropriate product of
components.

12.4.1.4 Finding the Angle Between Two Vectors
In the previous section we saw that, in spite of appearances, we do not
need to know the angle between two vectors in order to evaluate the
scalar product according to eqn (12.8): we simply exploit the
properties of the orthonormal base vectors to evaluate the result
algebraically. However, we can approach from a different perspective,
and use the right-hand side of eqn (12.8) to find the angle between two
vectors, having evaluated the scalar product using the approach
detailed above. The next Worked Problem details how this is
accomplished.

a Triangle
If the sides of the triangle OPQ in Figure 12.5, formed from the
vectors a, b and c have magnitudes a, b and c, respectively, and B is
the angle opposite b, then we can use eqns (12.8) and (12.9) to find a
useful relationship between a, b, c and B.

which we form the scalar product b?b:

However, since we know that the scalar product of a vector with itself
yields the square of its magnitude [eqn (12.9)], and that the angle
between a and c is B (and not 180u 2 B), it follows that:
b:b~b2~a2zc2{2ac cos B:

This can be extended to construct analogous expressions involving the

the cosine formula, involving the angle C.
Hint: Find an expression for c?c and decide, using Figure 12.11,
whether the angle h (in degrees) between the vectors a and b is
the same as angle C or the angle 180u 2 C. Remember: the

regardless of our choice of a, b and c or angles A, B and C.

12.4.2 Vector Product of Two Vectors
In the previous section, we defined the scalar product as a vector
operation resembling the act of multiplication, which results in a
scalar (or number, with or without units). We can now define a
second type of vector multiplication known as the vector product,
which results in another vector rather than a number. The vector
product is defined as:
a|b~{b|a~ aj j bj j sin h:^n,
ð12:15Þ
where ^n is the unit vector orthogonal (perpendicular in 2-D or 3-D
space) to the plane containing a and b. Since there are two possible
choices for ^n (up or down), the convention for selecting the
appropriate direction for ^n requires the vectors a, b and ^n to form a
right-handed system of axes as shown in Figure 12.13:
If we imagine the action of a right-hand corkscrew, in which a is
rotated towards b, in an anti-clockwise sense when viewed from
above, the corkscrew moves in the direction of ^n; it follows that the
analogous corkscrew motion taking b to a (clockwise) yields a
movement in the direction of 2^n. Consequently, the vector products
involving the base vectors ^j and ^k, or, by suitable changes, any other
pair of base vectors, are determined by forming a right-hand
clockwise system as seen in Figure 12.14.

273

Although analogous results can be derived for other pairs of base
vectors, the simplest aid for obtaining the appropriate result is to use
the diagram shown in Figure 12.15. The vector product ^i 6 ^j for
example, is verified by moving in a clockwise manner from^i to^j to the
next base vector ^k. However, ^j 6 ^i yields 2^k because anticlockwise
circulation introduces a negative sign.
In forming the vector product of two vectors a and b, we should
remember that:

The order of operation is very important – the operation is not

Worked Problem 12.5
Consider the parallelogram OPQR in shown in Figure 12.16. If
we extend OR to point T and drop perpendicular lines from P to
S and from Q to T, we construct a rectangle with the same area
as the original parallelogram: a result achieved by chopping off
the triangle OPS from the left side of the parallelogram and
reattaching it at the right side.
Q. (a) Explain why the areas of the triangles OPS and RQT are
equal.
(b) If the directed line segments OR
! and OP
!, are represented
by the vectors a and b, show that the area of the
parallelogram is given by |a|h.
(c) Deduce that the area, A, of the parallelogram is given by
|a6b|.
A. (a) The areas of the triangles OPS and RQT are equal
because the lengths of the sides OP and RQ are the same,
as are the angles POˆ S and QRˆ T.
(b)Given the equivalency of the two triangles OPS and RQT,
the area of the rectangle SPQT must be the same as that
of the parallelogram OPQR. Consequently the area of
the parallelogram must be equal to the magnitude of ST
!
multiplied by the height of the rectangle, h. Since ST
! has
the same magnitude as OR
!, and OR
! is represented by the
vector a, it follows that the magnitude of ST
! is equal to
the magnitude of a. Thus, the area A 5 |a|h.

Problem 12.9(b), with the expansion of a determinant of order three,

12.5.3 The Scalar Triple Product
If we define three vectors a, b and c, as in Problem 12.9, the expression
a?(b 6 c), known as the scalar triple product, yields a scalar quantity,
the magnitude of which provides the formula for the volume, V, of a
parallelepiped with adjacent edges defined by vectors a, b and c (an
example in chemistry being a crystalline unit cell). If the determi-

determinant from the first row, and evaluating the three scalar
products, we obtain:

using the negative value for a3 yields an identical result for the
volume of the unit cell. The negative value for a3 arises as a

Simple Statistics and Error
Analysis
In this 13th and final chapter we start by addressing a question that
might interest the more superstitious reader in particular, but which
also makes an important point about the significance of sample size in
experimental measurement. The number 13 is noteworthy in
mathematics for a number of reasons but most obviously because it
is a prime number. It also has many associations in folk law, and in
many cultures is considered to be an unlucky number. So just how
unlucky is it? How might we determine, for example, whether or not
Friday 13th is a day to stay home or to venture out? A study published
in the British Medical Journal concluded that ‘The risk of hospital
admission as a result of a transport accident [on a Friday 13th] may be
increased by as much as 52%’.1 This conclusion resulted from a
statistical analysis of the number of hospital admissions due to traffic
accidents on six different Friday 13th’s over a four year period
compared to the previous Friday the 6th in each of the months
sampled. The sampling over six sets of data is of course an important
component of the analysis but, at the outset of our discussion, it may
not be obvious whether the sample is large enough to eliminate doubt
about the significance of the findings. However, what should be clear
is that comparison of a single Friday 6th with a single Friday 13th
would be meaningless: in order to draw any meaningful conclusion
about such an observation, we have to demonstrate reproducibility.
In the case of their study, the authors will also have had to normalise
the data set against other factors such as the volume of traffic on the
road on each pair of days and take account of whether or not a
particular Friday the 13th or Friday 6th falls on a bank holiday. They
would also need to be sure that each hospital admission entry is
definitely associated with an accident occurring on the day in
question, with any resulting uncertainties accounted for in their
conclusions. Such principles of sampling, statistical significance, the
presentation and analysis of data and the assessment of its reliability
lie at heart of scientific observation and of course of experimental
chemistry.
281

The conclusions we draw about the significance of our experimental
measurements depend critically on how carefully we design our
experiment, our choice of method and how well we assess errors
associated with our experiments. Sometimes we are making a simple
measurement of some physical quantity, the eventual recorded value
of which derives from repeated measurements using a tried and tested
experimental approach. However, sometimes we might measure a
quantity under a range of different experimental conditions in order
to determine some other quantity that is related to the measured one
through a mathematical relationship.
In this final chapter, we will look first of all at the types of errors
associated with a measurement before going on to look in closer detail
at statistical distributions of measurements and how we can extract a
best estimate of a true value from a distribution as well as a measure
of the uncertainty associated with that value. We then take a look at
linear regression analysis, a topic that is immensely important when
measurements take the form of a determination of a value of a
dependent variable, such as a rate of reaction, for each of several
values of an independent variable, such as concentration of a
reactant. We close the chapter by looking at how errors propagate
(discussed briefly in the context of differentials in Section 5.3) when
the value of a physical quantity is not measured directly from an
experiment but derives from a functional relationship with another
measured quantity.
Aims:
The aim of this chapter is to develop an appreciation of how
simple statistics can be used to understand the nature of
repeated experimental measurement, how it can help us process
and interpret experimental results and, importantly, how it
enables us to make meaningful and useful assessments of errors
arising from common experimental situations. By the end of the
chapter, you should be able to:
N
Recognise the sources and nature of different types of error
in an experiment.
N
Understand the difference between systematic and random
errors.
N
Understand the key features of the Gaussian or normal
distribution and to be able to define the terms: mean,
variance, standard deviation and standard error.

standard error of the sample mean of a set of data and
deduce the 95% confidence interval.
N

best values of the parameters appearing in the linear
relationship and the uncertainties associated with them.
N
Determine how errors propagate through functions of single
and multiple variables
N
Understand the distinction between absolute and relative
errors.
13.1 Errors
The uncertainty in a measurement is commonly also called the error
but we have to exercise a little care in how we use this term. Errors are
often associated with mistakes or with something that is definitely
wrong but scientists tend to think of them as either:
1)
The discrepancy between a measured value and some generally
accepted true value – generally referred to as the accuracy of the
measurement, or
2)
The degree to which repeated measurement of a particular
quantity gives the same result – generally referred to as the
precision of the measurement.
An experimental method may be accurate but not especially precise
if it suffers from random errors, but equally it may yield inaccurate
results with high precision if it is subject to systematic errors (see
Figure 13.1). In an experiment free from serious systematic errors, we
can improve the precision considerably by increasing the sample size.

13.1.1 Systematic Errors
A laboratory measurement of the boiling point (b.p.) of isoamyl
acetate, produced in an undergraduate experiment to synthesize
banana oil, yields a temperature of 123 uC, a value the student notes
to be 19 uC below the known reference value of 142 uC. What can the
student conclude about this observation? Perhaps they made the
wrong product, or perhaps their technique was somehow at fault.
Repeating the measurement with the same thermometer but on a
sample produced by a different student yields a boiling point of
124 uC, a result close enough to the first measurement to suggest that
the method or apparatus may be at fault. A demonstrator suggests
trying a different type of alcohol thermometer and this time the
measured boiling point is 130 uC. A third measurement with a
mercury thermometer that had been calibrated against a known
standard yields a value of 141 uC. We now have four data points and
are significantly closer towards being able to draw a meaningful
conclusion about the reason for the low initial value of the measured
boiling point. Repetition of this process using twenty different
thermometers then builds up a data set describing a statistical
distribution of thermometer performance at temperatures above
115 uC (shown in Figure 13.2), but perhaps is not terribly helpful in
providing us with the definitive boiling point measurement of the
ester. This type of error, resulting from some deficiency in the
apparatus, is known as a systematic error and is not revealed by
repeated measurement using the same apparatus and technique. We

The frequency
distribution of twenty boiling point
measurements of an ester made
with twenty different
thermometers is shown in a
frequency histogram. In this case,
the data reveal a systematic error

The systematic error derives in
this case from deficiencies in the
types of thermometer used to
make the measurements.

Maths for Chemists

only discover its existence having considered the apparatus used and
perhaps the process too. The true value of the boiling point of the
ester will be that which has been determined by the most reliable and
accurate method, with that having been established by benchmarking
or calibration against some sort of standard.
Systematic errors always affect the accuracy of the result and will
tend to do so in the same direction – i.e. the answer will always tend to
be too high or too low rather than fluctuating about some central
value following successive measurements. As a consequence of the
fact that they derive from deficiencies of one sort or another in the
experimental apparatus, they cannot be quantified by a statistical
analysis of repeated observations.
13.1.2 Random Errors
The somewhat uncomfortable reality of experimental measurement is
that two measurements of the same physical property with identical
apparatus, using a nominally identical procedure, will almost
invariably yield slightly different results. Repeating the measurement
further will continue to yield slightly different values each time. Such
variations result from random fluctuations in the experimental
conditions from one measurement to the next and from limitations
associated with the precision of the apparatus or the technique of
whoever is conducting the experiment. The statistical nature of these
fluctuations means that the discrepancies with respect to the ‘true’
value are equally likely to be positive or negative. The precision of the
final result can always be improved by performing more and more
measurements until the distribution of the scattered results becomes
better defined, at which point the average value and an uncertainty
associated with it can be established. It is this type of uncertainty or
error that can be best treated using statistical methods.
Problem 13.1
Write down some examples of sources of random errors that
might affect experiments you have performed at school or
college or as part of your degree course. In each case, try to
think of ways in which the impact of each source of error might
be minimised.

13.2 The Statistics of Repeated Measurement
13.2.1 The Binomial Distribution
In the example given in the introduction to this chapter, the analysis
of hospital admissions following road traffic accidents was based on
six sets of data, five of which showed larger numbers of hospital
admissions on a given Friday 13th compared with the previous Friday
6th, and one of which showed the opposite result. We can get some
idea of the extent to which this data set is large enough by considering
the probabilities associated with the possible outcomes of the tossing
of a coin. For each toss of the coin, there are two equally likely
outcomes with the probability of getting heads, P(H), 1
2, and the
probability of getting tails, P(T), which is also 1
2. For two tosses of the
coin, there are 22 possible outcomes with the probability of each
outcome, HH, HT, TH or TT, being the product of the probability
associated with each toss, i.e. 1
2 | 1
2 ~ 1
2
 2~ 1
4. In other words, there is
a one in four chance that any prediction of the outcome of two tosses
will be correct. For three tosses, there are 23 possible outcomes, each
with equal probability, some of which will be associated with the same
nominal outcome but distinguished by the order in which the heads
and tails fall. For example, the probability that we get HHT is the
same as HTH or THH but each outcome counts as a distinguishable
result, contributing as a result to the total probability that we get two
heads and one tails. If we define P(n/N) as the total probability that n
heads results from N tosses of the coin, accounting for the fact that
each result may be achievable in more than one distinguishable way
(with the number of tails being N 2 n), then the total probabilities
associated with 3, 2, 1 and 0 heads following three tosses are:

Problem 13.2
Use the binomial distribution in eqn (13.1) to calculate the
probability of getting five heads and one tail from six tosses of a
coin.
It is instructive at this point to extend Problem 13.2 to encompass all
possible outcomes of six tosses of a coin, and then to compare the
theoretical result with results obtained from two sets of experiments.
Each set of experiments records the number of heads obtained from
six tosses of a coin: in the first experiment the data derive from ten
consecutive sets of six tosses and in the second from twenty sets. The
result of this comparison is shown in Figure 13.3.
We can make two important observations from this comparison:
1) The theoretical probability of tossing five heads is about 1 in 10
(or to be precise, 3 in 32), a value large enough to suggest that
some care is required in drawing conclusions from any one
experiment in which one particular result is obtained five times
out of six (and to wander at what point one might speculate
about whether or not the coin is weighted!). The road traffic
accident data in the example discussed in the introduction is
binary in the sense that we might equate ‘heads’ with ‘more
accidents on Friday 13th’ and ‘tails’ with ‘more accidents on the
preceding Friday 6th’. Thus a batch of data taken from one 4-
year period is just as likely to throw up an odd result as one
particular set of six tosses of a coin.
Figure 13.3

two sets of experimental data,
reporting the results of sets of six
consecutive coin tosses with the
theoretical binomial probability
distribution. It is worth noting that
the absence of experimental bars
against the 0 and the 6 simply
reflects the very low probability of
tossing six heads or six tails from
six consecutive tosses. This
absence of data should not come
as a surprise given the odds (1 in
64) and the sample sizes (10 and
20). It is also worth noting the
absence of a five heads
sequence in the smaller 10 sets
sample for similar reasons.
288
Maths for Chemists

2) As the sample size increases from ten to twenty, the differences
between the experimental relative frequencies and the theoretical
probability distribution get smaller – with our faith in the
experimental results increasing as a result.
This last observation serves as a good point to consider in more
detail how we use a distribution deriving from a large sample of data
to derive a reliable estimate of the quantity being measured and an
estimate of the uncertainties associated with that measurement.
13.2.2 The Gaussian Distribution
As we have seen above, the results of an experiment subject to
random uncertainties will tend to cluster about a central most
probable value. In such a distribution, the probability of obtaining a
value different from the most probable value decreases as that
difference increases. For a very large number of measurements, the
distribution will adopt a relatively smooth probability density
function, p(x), typically having the mathematical form:
p x
ð Þ~
1
s
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2p
p
e{ x{m
ð
Þ2
2s2
ð13:2Þ
The physical significance of the symmetrical function p(x) is best
understood from its definite integral
ðb
a
p x
ð Þdx which gives the
fraction of measurements that fall between x 5 a and x 5 b with
p(x)dx being the probability that any one measurement falls between
x and x + dx. The function p(x) in eqn (13.2) is known as the Gaussian
distribution, or sometimes the normal distribution, and is characterised
by a central mean (average) value, m, and a width parameter, s. A plot
of the function is shown in Figure 13.4 for two different values of s.
13.2.2.1 The Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation
For an experiment in which we take N measurements, xi (i 5 1, 2, …
N), the mean value x¯ is given by:
x~ 1
N

ð13:3Þ
This experimental mean is our best estimate of the ‘true’ mean, m,
something we could only find by making an infinite number of
measurements. The spread of the distribution, parameterised by s,
provides us with a measure of the uncertainty associated with the
Simple Statistics and Error Analysis
289

mean. A first step to quantifying this scatter about the mean might be
to calculate the average value of the individual deviations from the
mean, xi2x¯, but, for a symmetrical distribution, any one deviation is
more or less equally likely to be either positive or negative and so an
average deviation would then be close to zero. Consequently, it is
conventional to calculate the square root of the average of the squares
of all the deviations. This is known as the standard deviation and given
the symbol, s. Its square, s2, is called the variance and is defined by:
s2~ 1

ð13:4Þ
13.2.2.2 The Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation
In practice, we do not know the ‘true’ value of the measured quantity,
but only have an estimate of it provided from our sample mean. We
must then reflect this additional uncertainty in our estimate of the
standard deviation from our limited sample by defining our best
estimate of the true variance, s2, as the sample variance, s2, given by:
s2~

In going from s2 to s2, we say that the number of degrees of
freedom has been reduced by 1 from N to N 2 1 because we have

already used the sample once to calculate the value of x¯ required in
the calculation of s.
13.2.2.3 Confidence Intervals
The probability that a particular value of x lies within a certain
interval, ¡a, of the mean can be determined from the area enclosed
by the Gaussian distribution function between m 2 a and m + a. We
can use the calculation of the integral and hence area to arrive at a
range within which we can expect the values to lie within a particular
probability. For the Gaussian distribution, the probability that x lies
within s of the mean is 0.683; that it lies within 2s is 0.954; and that it
lies within 3s is 0.997. In other words, approximately 68% of the
measured values will lie within one standard deviation of the mean;
approximately 95% will lie within two standard deviations and over
99% will lie within three standard deviations. We can then define the
‘68% confidence interval’ as m ¡ s; the ‘95% confidence interval’ as
m ¡ 2s and the ‘99% confidence interval’ as m ¡ 3s (Figure 13.5).
Figure 13.5

distribution, approximately 68%
of the measured values will lie
within one standard deviation of
the mean (upper panel) and 95%
will lie within two standard
deviations (lower panel).

13.2.2.4 Standard Error of the Mean and Standard Error of the Sample
Mean
One defining feature of the discussion so far is that, if in doubt, make
more measurements! A natural intuitive expectation that follows from
this is that as the number of measurements, N, increases, so should the
precision with which we determine the mean. This is particularly
important because the mean is generally what we are most interested
in finding and what the experiment was designed to measure in the
first place. We can visualise this as the experimental distribution
smoothing out as more measurements are made, with the centre of the
distribution becoming better defined. This happens in spite of the fact
that the spread or width of the distribution remains more or less
constant. A good illustration of this process is shown in Figure 13.3 in
which experimental frequency distributions in the numbers of heads
in samples of six successive coin tosses are compared with the
theoretical binomial distribution. What is clear from the plots is that
the ‘10 sets of tosses’ distribution deviates the most from the binomial
distribution and is skewed to lower values. The average number of
heads from the 10 sets of tosses is 2.7; from 20 sets, 3.05; and, of
course from the perfectly symmetrical binomial distribution, 3. This
difference in the evaluation of the mean happens in spite of the fact
that the widths of all three distributions look about the same. We can
quantify this improvement in precision by defining the standard error
of the mean, sm, which is related to the standard deviation by:
sm~ sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
ð13:7Þ
In terms of sample parameters, we can define the standard error of
the sample mean, sx¯, which is related to the sample standard deviation,
s, by:
sx~
sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
:
ð13:8Þ
Eqn (13.8) provides the important result that the precision of the
mean value improves with the square root of the number of
measurements, N. The standard error of the sample mean, sx¯, is the
quantity most commonly used to represent the uncertainty in a
measured mean resulting from several measurements.
As highlighted above, the key difference between the sample
standard deviation and the standard error of the sample mean is the
factor
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
in the denominator of the latter. The standard deviation of
the sample mean, s, provides us with the average uncertainty in the
individual measurement of the xi and consequently will not change
292
Maths for Chemists

noticeably as we make more measurements. On the other hand, the
standard error of the sample mean, sx¯, will decrease in value as we
increase the number of measurements. This is in keeping with our
expectation that the reliability of our measured mean improves as the
number of measurements increases. Unfortunately, the square root
means that in order to improve our precision by a factor of ten, we
would need to make a hundred times as many measurements!
In reporting our results, it is conventional, if our best estimate of
our quantity x is the mean value of several measurements to write:
measured value of x~x+sx
where sx¯ provides a good measure of its uncertainty. This expression
implies that we expect approximately 68% of any measurements of x,
made using the same method, to fall within the range x¯¡sx¯.
How we choose to express the uncertainty associated with our
measurement depends on how certain we are of our reported value.
The convention described above assigns a confidence level that most
scientists would view as reasonable and useful. However, sometimes
we might want to broaden the limits of our confidence and you will
often see uncertainties reported in terms of 95% confidence limits.
13.2.2.5 Student t Factors and the 95% Confidence Limit
For a Gaussian distribution, there is a 95% probability that the range

13.3 Linear Regression Analysis
In many experiments, the measurements involve the determination of
a value of some dependent variable (i.e. the one being measured) for
each of several values of an independent variable (i.e. one that the
experimenter controls or chooses). For example, in the experiment
covered in Problem 13.3, the equilibrium vapour pressure of
ammonium carbamate is measured at a number of different
temperatures. It will often be the case that a linear relationship exists
between the dependent and independent variables, with the measured
values of the dependent variable being distributed about an imagined
straight line describing the perfect linear relationship between the two
variables.

Of course many relationships are not linear functions but we can
still often use linear regression analyses in these examples by
linearising the relationship into a form which yields a straight line
plot. In the example of ammonium carbamate, the equilibrium
constant, Kp, varies with temperature according to the relationship:
Kp~e{DH o{
RT zDSo{
R
ð13:9Þ
This function is clearly not linear in form but can easily be converted
into linear form by taking natural logs each side:
ln Kp~{ DH o{
RT z DS o{
R
ð13:10Þ
A plot of ln Kp vs. 1 / T will then yield a straight line, with gradient
{DH o{=R and y-intercept at DS o{=R.
The advantage of linear regression analysis is the simplicity of the
concept and of the process (although this latter observation may be
regarded as irrelevant given that most regressions will be performed
on a computer), but the disadvantage is that uncertainties are often
propagated through the linearisation process in a distorted way. This
can result in misleading evaluation of errors if, for example, an
equation is linearised by taking logs, such as in the transformation of
eqn (13.9) into eqn (13.10).
13.3.1 The Least-Squares Method
13.3.1.1 Finding the Best Gradient and y-Intercept
For any experimental data set describing a linear relationship between
two variables, we will have an intuitive sense of what the ‘best’
straight line through a scatter plot of the points should look like, but
it is also possible to define the best fit line quantitatively. Given a data
set of N measurements of a dependent variable, y, labelled y1, y2,
y3, …, yi, …, yN for each corresponding independent variable x1, x2,
x3, …, xi, …, xN with a theoretical linear relationship existing between
the two sets:
y~mxzc
ð13:11Þ
a plot of the yi values against the xi values should yield a set of data
similar to that shown in Figure 13.6. Once a line has been drawn
through the data points, we can measure the distance of each point
from the line, with this distance being defined as the vertical distance
Simple Statistics and Error Analysis
295

between the data point and a point on the line directly above or below
it. These distances, commonly referred to as residuals, yi 2 yline, will
either be positive or negative, depending on whether the point lies
above or below the line. However the squares of residuals (yi 2 yline)2
will all be positive. The method of least squares works by choosing the
line with gradient and intercept that makes the sum of these squares
over all the points as small as possible. In other words, we aim to
minimise the sum:

where mxi + c 5 yline, with respect to the parameters m and c given in

(pronounced chi squared) with respect to m and c, and setting the
result of each derivative to zero (see Section 4.4.1 for discussion on
the finding and defining of stationary points):

Consequently, m and c can be calculated by gathering together the
appropriate sums from the experimental data and substituting them
into eqns (13.17) and (13.18), respectively. Of course, we also need to
find the uncertainties associated with the parameters m and c but in
order to do that we need first to establish the uncertainty in our
measurements of the yi.
13.3.1.2 Finding the Uncertainties Associated with the Gradient and
y-Intercept
If we assume that our measurement of each yi is distributed normally
about its true value, yline 5 mxi + c, with a width parameter sy, then
the residuals yi 2 yline will also be normally distributed about the
same central value and with the same width, sy. A sensible approach
at this point might be to suggest that an estimate for sy may be
obtained by using a sum of squares approach:

However, the constants m and c in eqn (13.20) are the true values of
the constants, rather than the best estimates that we arrived at from
eqns (13.17) and (13.18), and so we need to reflect this in our estimate
of sy by reducing the degrees of freedom by 2 (having used up 2 in
computing m and c). Thus eqn (13.20) becomes modified to:

Use linear regression to evaluate the Arrhenius parameters,
Ea and A for this reaction.

depends upon temperature according to k~Ae{Ea=RT. In order
to perform a linear regression, you will first need to convert this
equation into linear form.
Eqns (13.17) and (13.18) assumed that the measurements of the yi

These equations look horrendous but are actually quite straightfor-

Although this whole process can be time-consuming and even
tedious if performing multiple linear regressions on a set of data by
hand, doing so can provide a degree of insight not available when
running a linear regression analysis on a computer using modern data
plotting software such as Excel or Origin.
13.4 Propagation of Errors
13.4.1 Uncertainty in a Single Variable
It is often the case that the value of a particular physical quantity is
not measured directly in an experiment but instead is calculated from
some other measured quantity. For example, in rotational spectro-
scopy, adjacent pairs of lines in the microwave spectrum of a
heteronuclear diatomic molecule such as 12CO are separated by twice
the rotational constant B (neglecting the effects of centrifugal
distortion) which itself is related to the bond length, r, through the
relationship:
B~
h2
8p2cmr2 cm{1
ð13:28Þ
where m~ mCmO
mCzmO
is the reduced mass and c, the speed of light in cm
s21. In this example, we need to be confident about how the
uncertainties associated with our measurement of B transfer to an
error associated with our subsequent determination of the bond
length, r. The process of transferring error in one quantity to another
quantity is known as the propagation of errors.
Let us imagine we have measured the value of some quantity, x,
and have an estimate of its uncertainty, sx. If x is related to the value
Simple Statistics and Error Analysis
301

of another quantity, y, through some functional relationship y 5 f(x)
then the uncertainty in y, sy will be related to the slope of the
function, d
dx f and the magnitude of sx (see Figure 13.7)
Assuming sx is small enough that the slope is approximately
constant across the range x ¡ sx we can make the approximation
that:
sy& d
dx f

sx
ð13:29Þ
or, avoiding the use of the modulus:
s2
y&
d
dx f

2
s2
x
ð13:30Þ
Clearly, eqns (13.29) and (13.30) are equivalent in the sense that
they will yield exactly the same value for sy. However, we shall see
later, in discussing how errors propagate in functions of more than
one independent variable, that the two analogous expressions in that
case do not produce identical values for the error propagated through
to the dependent variable.
The quantities sx and sy are known as the absolute uncertainties in
x and y. The relative uncertainties for particular values of x and y are
obtained by dividing sx and sy by x and y, respectively.
Figure 13.7
For two quantities,
x and y related through a function
y 5 f(x), the uncertainty in y, sy,
will be related to the slope of the
function, d
dx f and the magnitude of
sx.

Worked Problem 13.3
Q. Two quantities are related through the linear relationship:
y~kx
where the absolute uncertainty associated with measurements of
quantity x is sx. Find the absolute and relative uncertainties in y
and write down the relationship between the relative uncertain-
ties in x and y.
A. The modulus of the derivative is:
dy

~ kj j
and so the absolute uncertainty in y from eqn (13.29) is:
sy~ kj jsx
ð13:31Þ
The relative uncertainty in y is:
sy
y
j j ~ kj jsx
y
j j ~ kj jsx
k

ð13:32Þ
For a linear relationship between x and y, the absolute
uncertainty in y is k times the absolute uncertainty in x, whereas
the relative uncertainties in x and y are equal.
Worked Problem 13.4
Q. Two quantities are related through the relationship:
y~xn

A. The modulus of the derivative is:

Problem 13.5
Bimolecular collision theory provides some insight into the
significance of the Arrhenius parameters appearing Arrhenius
equation k~Ae{Ea=RT. Consider the elementary reaction
CH3zH2?CH4zH
The first step in estimating the pre-exponential factor A for
this reaction involves calculating the collision cross-section s 5
pd2 where d is the sum of the hard-sphere radii d~rCH3zrH2 of
the reactants CH3 and H2. Given d 5 (6.50 ¡ 0.14) 6 10210 m
use eqn (13.34) to calculate the relative and hence absolute
uncertainties in the collision cross-section s .
Note: Try not to confuse the symbol s used for the collision
cross-section with the s’s used to represent the respective
uncertainties!
Worked Problem 13.5
Q. Two quantities are related through the relationship:
y~ln x
with absolute uncertainty in x, sx. Find the absolute and

and so the absolute uncertainty in y is:

which yields the unexpected result that the absolute uncertainty

Problem 13.6
Two quantities are related through the relationship:
y~ex
with absolute uncertainty in x, sx. Find the absolute and
relative uncertainties in y and comment on how your result
compares to that in Worked Problem 13.5.
Problem 13.7
The rotational constant, B, for 12CO is measured as 1.923 cm21
with an uncertainty of ¡0.005 cm21. Use eqn (13.28) to
calculate the bond length, r, of 12CO assuming c 5 2.998 6 1010
cm s21, h 5 6.626 6 10234 J s and mCO 5 1.139 6 10226 kg.
Hence use your answer and the result from Worked Problem
13.4 to find the absolute and relative errors in r.
13.4.2 Combining Uncertainties in More Than One Variable
If we consider a functional relationship y 5 f(u, v, …) in which the
dependent variable y depends on two or more independent variables,
u, v, …, then we need to exercise a little care in deciding which of the
propagation of errors formulae in eqns (13.29) and (13.30) we extend
to include the additional variables when combining their uncertain-
ties. Extending first the modulus expression in eqn (13.29) yields:

sy~ L
Lu f

suz L
Lv f

ð13:36Þ
The problem here is that eqn (13.36) will tend to over-estimate sy
because it assumes that all of the component uncertainties, su, sv, …
will contribute to the total uncertainty to their full extent in the same
direction, i.e. it assumes that they will either all be positive or all be
negative. In practice, if the component uncertainties are independent
and random, there will be a higher probability that some of the
contributing errors will be positive and some negative with the
resulting uncertainty then being smaller than that implied by eqn
(13.36). In order to acknowledge this implicit overestimation of the
total uncertainty, we modify eqn (13.36) to:
sy¡ L
Lu f

suz L
Lv f

svz . . .
ð13:37Þ
which describes the error in y as being no larger than the sum of the
terms on the right-hand side. Thus, if you wish to calculate an upper
limit to the uncertainty, eqn (13.37) provides a safe choice.
If instead, we now combine the terms as suggested by extension of
eqn (13.30) by squaring them, adding the squares and then taking the
square root, we end up with an estimate of sy that will always be
smaller than that deriving from simple addition of terms. For
situations in which the errors in u and v are random and independent
(i.e. uncorrelated), a more realistic estimate of sy will then be obtained
by the expression:

independent variables are related for functions involving addition and
subtraction, and multiplication and division.

In other words, the absolute uncertainty in y is the root mean

independent of whether u and v are added or subtracted in the
initial function.
Working through the same process, but this time starting with
eqn (13.37), yields the upper limit to the uncertainty in y which
results from a simple addition in uncertainties in u and v:

larger values provides us with an upper limit to the uncertainty,
whereas the first provides us with a more realistic estimate
assuming the errors associated with rCH3 and rH2 are independent
and random.

Problem 13.9
In an experiment, we allow 0.0200 mol of solid CO2 (a little less
than 1 g) to sublime in an evacuated 10 cm3 round-bottomed
flask at room temperature (298 K). Assuming no measurable
uncertainties apply to the volume of the flask, and that the
estimated uncertainty associated with our measurement of the
amount of CO2 is sn 5 ¡0.0002 mol and of the temperature,
sT 5 ¡0.5 K, use the ideal gas law to find the pressure exerted
by the CO2 on the flask and the relative and absolute
uncertainties associated with that value.
Problem 13.10
Use eqn (13.37) to calculate an upper limit to the absolute
uncertainty associated with the calculated pressure of CO2 from
Problem 13.9.
Hint: The approach you take here is equivalent to that described
in Section 5.3 which discussed the use of differentials in the
calculation of propagation of errors. The answer you get should
be larger than the value you determined from Problem 13.9.
Summary of Key Points
This chapter describes how simple statistics can be used in the
interpretation of experimental results and in the treatment of
errors arising from experimental measurement. The chapter is
divided into four sections covering types of error, the statistics
of repeated measurement, linear regression analysis and the
propagation of errors. The key points discussed include:
1.
The distinction between the accuracy and precision of an
experimental measurement and between systematic and
random errors.
2.
How the binomial distribution can be used to compute the
probabilities associated with experiments yielding one of
two possible outcomes.
Simple Statistics and Error Analysis

3.
The Gaussian (or normal) distribution commonly used to
model the results of repeated experimental measurement.
4.
The variance and standard deviation as measures of the
uncertainties associated with the ‘true’ mean value of the
Gaussian distribution.
5.
The sample variance and sample standard deviation as
measures of the uncertainties associated with the sample
mean.
6.
The significance of 68% and 95% confidence intervals.
7.
The definition of the standard error of the mean and
standard error of the sample mean.
8.
Student t-factors and the 95% confidence limit.
9.
The least-squares method in linear regression analysis
10. The propagation of errors in functions of a single variable
11. The propagation of errors in functions of more than one
variable

and problems to illustrate practical applications of statistics
and error analysis.

We need to exercise some care here because the quantity a?b will yield
an angle h5180u2C, which in this example is an acute angle, rather
than the obtuse angle required. Consequently, we must substitute
180u2C for h which gives:

(d) The 95% confidence interval 5 142.1429 ¡ 6.5591 kJ mol21.
For DG o{:
(a) Mean 5 20.4571 kJ mol21.
(b) The sample standard deviation 5 0.8410 kJ mol21.
(c) The standard error of the sample mean 5 0.2248 kJ mol21
and so we report the mean Gibbs free energy as DGo{5

(d) The 95% confidence interval 5 20.4571 ¡ 0.4811 kJ mol21.
13.4 The Arrhenius equation can be rearranged to give a form which
is suitable for linear regression by taking natural logs both sides
to yield
ln k~ln A{ Ea
RT
A plot of ln k against 1/T will then yield a straight line with a
gradient of 2Ea/R and a y-axis intercept at ln A.

For the gradient, 2Ea/R, we evaluate each of the terms that appear in
eqn (13.17) where we associate the xi values with 1 / T and the yi
values with ln k.

13.5 The collision cross-section s 5 pd2 5 p 6 (6.5 6 10210 m)2 5

i.e. twice the relative error in the parameter d. Multiplying the
relative error by the calculated value for the cross-section s yields
a value for the absolute uncertainty ss:
375

ss~0:043|1:327|10{18~5:707|10{20 m2
We might then record the calculated cross-section as
ss 5 (1.327 ¡ 0.057) 6 10218 m2.
13.6 The modulus of the derivative of y 5 ex is:
dy

and so the absolute uncertainty in y is sy 5 exsx with relative
uncertainty:

i.e. the relative uncertainty in y is the same as the absolute
uncertainty in x, the opposite result to that found for y 5 ln x.

Pa. With 1 bar 5 100 kPa, the sublimed CO2 will be exerting a
pressure of nearly 50 bar! As the ideal gas law is in the form of a
product with respect to the independent variables, n and T, the
relative uncertainty associated with P will be given by eqn

Multiplying this by P gives a value for the absolute uncertainty

Therefore, we might report the pressure as approximately 4955
