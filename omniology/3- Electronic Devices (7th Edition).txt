Preface
This seventh edition of Electronic Devices has been carefully revised and some important new
topics have been added. Several recommendations from reviewers and current users have been
incorporated to make this edition better. A comprehensive coverage of electronic devices and
circuits, including troubleshooting and System Applications, is provided. Chapters 1 through
11 are essentially devoted to fundamental discrete devices and circuits. Chapters 12through 18
primarily cover linear integrated circuits. Chapter 19is a new chapter that is completely devoted
to programmable analog devices. Data sheets are introduced in certain areas to provide a prac-
tical connection with actual devices. Extensive exercises and problems using Multisim" circuit
simulation are designed to help students verify circuit theory and develop troubleshooting and
measurement skills. Referenced Multisim circuit files are on the CD packaged with this book.

Chapter
19
introduces
field-
programmable
analog arrays (FPAAs) and how to program them. Also, switched-capacitor
circuits are described because they are basic to FPAA technology.
Circuit-Action
This feature is at the end of most chapters. It checks students' un-
derstanding
of how changes in certain parameters
affect the behavior of a circuit. Given a
specified change in one parameter,
students determine
the resulting effect (increase, de-
crease, no change) in another parameter or parameters.
lV/ore
of
High-intensity
LEDs are introduced and a new section
on fiber optics has been added.
New Devices
New sections on differential amplifiers and the IGBT (insulated gate bipo-
lar transistor) are now included.
Generai lmprovemen
Obsolete devices have been replaced, text descriptions have been
reworded for greater clarity, and graphics have been enhanced in certain areas for better ap-
pearance or improved effectiveness.

Multisim"
CD·ROM
Packaged with each textbook, this CD includes simulation circuits
in Multisim'" 7 for selected examples, troubleshooting
sections, and selected problems in the
text. These circuits were created for use with Multisim software, a schematic capture, simu-
lation, and programmable
logic tool used by college and university students in their course
of study of electronics and electrical engineering.
Multisim is widely regarded as an excellent circuit simulation tool for classroom
and
laboratory
learning. However, no part of your textbook is dependent
upon the Multisim
software or provided files. These files are provided at no extra cost to the consumer and are
for use by anyone who chooses to utilize Multisim software.
The circuits for the Examples in your text are already rendered "live" for you by Elec-
tronics Workbench in the Textbook Edition of Multisim 7. The Textbook Edition enables you
to do the following with the circuits in the Examples folder:
Manipulate the interactive components and adjust the value of any virtual components.
Run interactive simulation on the active circuits and use any pre-placed
virtual
instruments.
Run analyses.
Run/print/save
simulation results for the pre-defined viewable circuits.
Create your own circuits up to a maximum of 15 components.
All of the remaining circuits on the CD require that you have access to Multisim 7 in your
school lab (the Lab Edition) or on your computer (Electronics Workbench Student Suite). If
you do not currently have access to this software and wish to purchase it, please call Pren-
tice Hall Customer Service at 1-800-282-0693
or send afax request to 1-800-835-5327.
If you need technical assistance or have questions concerning
the Multisim software,

Section Opener
Each section in a chapter begins with a brief introduction and section ob-
jectives. An example is shown in Figure P-2.
Section Review
Each section in a chapter ends with a review consisting of questions that
highlight the main concepts presented in the section. This feature is also illustrated in Figure
P-2. The answers to the Section Reviews are at the end of the chapter.
Worked Examples, Related Problems, and Multisim Exercises
Numerous worked exam-
ples throughout
each chapter illustrate and clarify basic concepts or specific procedures.
Each example ends with a Related Problem that reinforces or expands on the example by
requiring the student to work through a problem similar to the example. Selected examples
feature a Multisim exercise keyed to a file on the CD-ROM that contains the circuit illus-
trated in the example. A typical example with a Related Problem and a Multisim exercise
is shown in Figure P-3. Answers to Related Problems are at the end of the chapter.
Troubleshooting Sections
Many chapters include a troubleshooting section that relates to the
topics covered in the chapter and that illustrates troubleshooting procedures and techniques.
SyJtem Application
System Applications
follow the last section in each chapter (ex-
cept Chapter
1) and are identified
by a special photographic
logo and colored
back-
ground design. A practical
application
of devices or circuits
covered
in the chapter
is
presented.
The student
learns how the specific
device or circuit
is used and in many
cases is asked to compare
a schematic
to a printed circuit board, develop a test proce-
dure, or troubleshoot
specific faults. A typical System Application
is shown in Figure
P-4. The System Applications
are optional
and skipping
any of them does not affect
any other coverage.
Although they are not intended or designed for use as a laboratory project, most System
Applications
use realistic graphics for printed circuit boards and instruments.
Results for
the System Applications
are provided in the Instructor's
Resource Manual.

Portion of a typical system application
section.
Option 1 (two terms)
Chapters 1 through 11 can be covered in the first term. Depending
on individual preferences and program emphasis, selective coverage may be necessary. For
example, you may choose to omit Chapter 11 if the topic of thyristors is covered in a later
industrial electronics
course. Chapters
12 through 19 can be covered in the second term.
Again, selective coverage may be necessary.
Option 2 (one term)
By omitting certain topics and by maintaining a rigorous schedule,
this book can be used in one-term courses. For example, a course covering only discrete de-
vices and circuits would cover Chapters 1 through 11 with, perhaps, some selectivity.
Similarly,
a course
requiring
only linear
integrated
circuit
coverage
would
cover
Chapters 12 through 19. Another approach is a very selective coverage of discrete devices
and circuits topics followed by a limited coverage of integrated
circuits (only op-amps,
for example).
To the Student
There is a saying that applies to the study of this textbook as well as many other endeavors
in life. It goes like this-Do
one thing at a time, do it very well, and then move on.
When studying a particular chapter, study one section until you understand it and only
then move on to the next one. Read each section and study the related illustrations carefully,

PREFACE
Thomas
Alva
Edison
1847-1931
Born in Milan,
Ohio, Thomas
Edison was the
most prolific
inventor of all
time. He iscredited with 1093
patents and isthe only person to
ever have at least one patent every
year for 65 consecutive years. Mr.
Edison's inventions and enterprises
encompass many different areas.
One of his most famous inventions,
the light bulb, was introduced
in
1879. Mr. Edison iscredited with
discovering the diode effect while
working with vacuum tubes for the
light bulb. Most of his work was
done in his laboratory in West
Orange, N). He also maintained
a
laboratory at his winter home in
Fort Myers, Florida, which was
devoted
principally to the
development
of a synthetic rubber
using the golden rod plant. (Photo

Lee DeForest
1873-1961
Born in Iowa,
Lee DeForest
became an
inventor while
in college to
help defray
expenses. He graduated from Yale
in 1899 with a PhD. His doctoral
thesis, "Reflection of Hertzian
Waves from the Ends of Parallel
Wires," began his long career in
radio. His invention of the vacuum
tube triode for use in amplification
(audion amplifier) was the most
important
of his more than 300
inventions. (Photo credit: The

Biography, courtesy AlP Emilio

Collection)
think about the material, work through each example step by step, work its Related Prob-
lem and check the answer, and then answer each question in the section review, checking
your answers at the end of the chapter. Don't expect each concept to be crystal clear after a
single reading; you may have to read the material two or even three times. Once you think
that you understand the material, review the chapter summary, key formula list, and key
term definitions at the end of the chapter. Take the circuit-action
quiz and the self-test. Fi-
nally, work the assigned problems at the end of the chapter. Working through these prob-
lems is perhaps the most important way to check and reinforce your comprehension
of the
chapter. By working problems, you acquire an additional level of insight and understand-
ing, and develop logical thinking that reading or classroom lectures alone do not provide.
Generally, you cannot fully understand
a concept or procedure by simply watching or
listening to someone else. Only hard work and critical thinking will produce the results you
expect and deserve.
Milestones
in Electronics
Before you begin your study of electronic devices, let's briefly look at some of the impor-
tant developments that led to the electronics technology we have today. The names of many
of the early pioneers in electricity
and electromagnetics
still live on in terms of familiar
units and quantities. Names such as Ohm, Ampere, Volta, Farad, Henry, Coulomb, Oersted,
and Hertz are some of the better known examples with which you are already familiar. More
widely known names such as Franklin and Edison are also significant in the history of elec-
tricity and electronics because of their tremendous contributions.
Biographies
of a few im-
portant figures in the history of electronics are shown.
Early experiments with electronics involved electric currents in vacuum tubes. Heinrich
Geissler (1814-1879)
removed most of the air from a glass tube and found that the tube
glowed when there was current through it. Later, Sir William Crookes (1832- 1919) found
the current in vacuum tubes seemed to consist of particles. Thomas Edison (1847-1931)
ex-
perimented
with carbon filament bulbs with plates and discovered that there was a current
from the hot filament to a positively charged plate. He patented the idea but never used it.
Other early experimenters
measured the properties of the particles that flowed in vac-
uum tubes. Sir Joseph Thompson (1856-1940)
measured properties ofthese particles, later
called electrons.
Although wireless telegraphic
communication
dates back to 1844, electronics is basi-
cally a 20th century concept that began with the invention of the vacuum tube amplifier. An
early vacuum tube that allowed current in only one direction was constructed by John A.
Fleming in 1904. Called the Fleming valve, it was the forerunner of vacuum tube diodes.
In 1907, Lee DeForest added a grid to the vacuum tube. The new device, called the au-
diotron, could amplify a weak signal. By adding the control element, DeForest ushered in
the electronics revolution. It was an improved version of his device that made transconti-
nental telephone service and radios possible. In 1912, a radio amateur in San Jose, Califor-
nia, was regularly broadcasting

In 1921, the secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, issued the first license to a broad-
cast radio station; within two years over 600 licenses were issued. By the end of the 1920s
radios were in many homes. A new type of radio, the superheterodyne
radio, invented by
Edwin
Armstrong,
solved
problems
with
high-frequency
communication.
In
1923,
Vladimir Zworykin, an American researcher, invented the first television picture tube, and
in 1927 Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for a complete television system.
The 1930s saw many developments
in radio, including metal tubes, automatic gain con-
trol, "midget" radios, and directional
antennas. Also started in this decade was the devel-
opment of the first electronic computers. Modern computers trace their origins to the work
of John Atanasoff at Iowa State University. Beginning in 1937, he envisioned a binary ma-
chine that could do complex mathematical
work. By 1939, he and graduate student Clifford
Berry had constructed a binary machine called ABC, (for Atanasoff-Berry
Computer) that
used vacuum tubes for logic and condensers
(capacitors)
for memory. In 1939, the mag-

netron, a microwave oscillator, was invented in Britain by Henry Boot and John Randall. In
the same year, the klystron microwave tube was invented in America by Russell and Sigurd
Varian.
The decade of the 1940s opened with World War n. The war spurred rapid advancements
in electronics.
Radar and very high-frequency
communication
were made possible by the
magnetron and klystron. Cathode ray tubes were improved for use in radar. Computer work
continued during the war. By 1946, John von Neumann had developed the first stored pro-
gram computer, the Eniac, at the University of Pennsylvania.
One of the most significant
inventions ever occurred in 1947 with the invention of the transistor. The inventors were
Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and William Shockley. All three won Nobel prizes for their
invention. PC (printed circuit) boards were also introduced in 1947. Commercial manufac-
turing of transistors didn't begin until 1951 in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
The most important invention of the 1950s was the integrated circuit. On September 12,
1958, Jack Kilby, at Texas Instruments,
made the first integrated circuit (Figure P-5), for
which he was awarded a Nobel prize in the fall of 2000. This invention literally created the
modern computer age and brought about sweeping changes in medicine, communication,
manufacturing,
and the entertainment industry. Many billions of "chips"-as
integrated cir-
cuits came to be called-have
since been manufactured.
The 1960s saw the space race begin and spurred work on miniaturization
and comput-
ers. The space race was the driving force behind the rapid changes in electronics that fol-
lowed.
The
first
successful
"op-amp"
was
designed
by
Bob
Widlar
at Fairchild
Semiconductor in 1965. Called the /lA 709, it was very successful but suffered from "latch-up"

An electrical
engineer and
physicist born in
Madison,
Wisconsin, Dr.
Bardeen was on the faculty of the
University of Minnesota from 1938
to 1941 and a physicist at the
Naval Ordnance
Lab from 1941 to
1945. He then joined Bell Labs
and remained there until 1951.
Some of his fields of interest were
conduction
in semiconductors
and
metals, surface properties of
semiconductors,
and
superconductivity.
While at Bell
Labs he jointly invented the
transistor with colleagues WaIter
Brattain and William Shockley.
After leaving Bell Labs in 1951, Dr.
Bardeen joined the faculty at the
University of Illinois. (Photo credit:

born in
London,
England, Dr.
Shockley
obtained
his PhD in 1936 from
M.I.T. He joined
Bell Labs upon
graduation and remained there
until 1955. His research emphasis
included areas of energy bands in
solids, theory of vacuum tubes,
photoelectrons,
ferromagnetic
domains, and transistor physics.
While at Bell Labs, Dr. Shockley
joined John Bardeen and Waiter
Brattain in the invention of the
transistor in 1947. After leaving Bell

Jack S. Kilby
1923-
Jack Kilbywas
born in
Missouri and
earned degrees
in electrical
engineering
from the University of Illinois and
the University of Wisconsin. From
1947 to 1958, he worked at the
Centralab Division of Globe Union,
Inc. in Milwaukee. In 1958, he
joined Texas Instruments in Dallas
where he was responsible for
integrated
circuit development
and
applications. Within a year after
joining TI he invented the
monolithic integrated
circuit and
the rest is history. Mr. Kilby left TI
in 1970. (Photo credit: Courtesy of

and other problems. Later, the most popular op-amp ever, the 741, took shape at Fairchild.
This op-amp became the industry standard and influenced design of op-amps for years to
come. Precursors to the Internet began in the 1960s with remote networked computers. Sys-
tems were in place within Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
that connected over
100 terminals to a computer system (colorfully called the "Octopus system"). In an exper-
iment in 1969 with remote computers,
an exchange
took place between researchers
at
UCLA and Stanford. The UCLA group hoped to connect to a Stanford computer and began
by typing the word "log in" on its terminal. A separate telephone connection was set up and
the following conversation occurred.
The UCLA group asked over the phone, "Do you see the letter L?"
"Yes, we see the L."
The UCLA group typed an O. "Do you see the letter O?"
"Yes, we see the 0."
The UCLA group typed a G. At this point the system crashed. Such was technology, but
a revolution was in the making.
By 1971, a new company that had been formed by a group from Fairchild introduced the
first microprocessor.
The company was Intel and the product was the 4004 chip, which had
the same processing power as the Eniac computer. Later in that same year, Intel announced
the first 8-bit processor, the 8008. In 1975, the first personal computer was introduced by
Altair, and Popular Science magazine featured it on the cover of the January 1975 issue.
The 1970s also saw the introduction of the pocket calculator and new developments in op-
tical integrated circuits.
By the 1980s, half of all U.S. homes were using cable hookups instead of television an-
tennas. The reliability, speed, and miniaturization
of electronics continued throughout
the
1980s, including automated testing and calibrating of PC boards. The computer became a
part of instrumentation
and the virtual instrument was created. Computers became a stan-
dard tool on the workbench.
The 1990s saw a widespread
application of the Internet. In 1993, there were 130 web-
sites; by the start of the new century (in 2001) there were over 24 million. In the 1990s,
companies scrambled to establish a home page and many of the early developments
of ra-
dio broadcasting had parallels with the Internet. The exchange of information and e-commerce
fueled the tremendous
economic growth of the 1990s. The Internet became especially im-
portant to scientists and engineers, becoming one of the most important scientific commu-
nication tools ever.
In 1995, the FCC allocated spectrum space for a new service called Digital Audio Ra-
dio Service. Digital television standards were adopted in 1996 by the FCC for the nation's
next generation of broadcast television. As the 20th century drew toward a close, historians
could only breathe a sign ofrelief.
As one person put it, "I'rn all for new technologies,
but
I wish they'd let the old ones wear out first."
The 21st century dawned on January 1, 2001 (although most people celebrated the new
century the previous year, known as "Y2K"). The major story was the continuing explosive
growth of the Internet; shortly thereafter, scientists were planning a new supercomputer
sys-
tem that would make massive amounts of information
accessible in a computer network.
The new international
data grid will be an even greater resource than the World Wide Web,
giving people the capability to access enormous amounts of information and the resources

to run simulations on a supercomputer.
Research in the 21st century continues along lines
of faster and smaller circuits using new technologies.
One promising area of research in-
volves carbon nanotubes, which have been found to have properties of semiconductors
in
certain configurations.
