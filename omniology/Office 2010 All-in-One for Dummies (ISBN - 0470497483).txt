Acknowledgments
This book owes a lot to many hard-working Indianapolis Colts fans at the 
offi ces of Wiley Publishing in Indiana. For the umpteenth time, I want to 
express my gratitude to Steve Hayes for his encouragement and the opportu-
nity to write another For Dummies book.
Susan Christophersen knows the editing craft as well as any editor I have 
ever worked with. It was a pleasure — once again — to work with her.
Technical editor Lee Musick made sure that all the explanations in this book 
are indeed accurate, and I would like to thank him for his diligence and sug-
gestions for improving this book. I would also like to thank Rich Tennant 
for the witty cartoons you will fi nd on the pages of this book and Potomac 
Indexing, LLC for writing the index.
These people at the Wiley offi ces in Indianapolis gave their all to this book, 
and I want to acknowledge them by name:
Carl Byers, Ashley Chamberlain, Samantha Cherolis, Katherine Crocker, Joyce 
Haughey, Rebecca Denoncour, Bonnie Mikkelson
Finally, I owe my family — Sofi a, Henry, and Addie — a debt for tolerating my 
vampire-like working hours and eerie demeanor at daybreak. How can I ever 
repay you?

Introduction
T
his book is for users of Office 2010 who want to get to the heart of the 
program without wasting time. Don’t look in this book to find out how 
the different programs in the Office suite work. Look in this book to find out 
how you can get your work done better and faster with these programs.
I show you everything you need to make the most of the different Office pro-
grams. On the way, you have a laugh or two. No matter how much or how 
little skill you bring to the table, the guidance of this book will make you a 
better, more proficient, more confident user of the Office programs.
What’s in This Book, Anyway?
This book is your guide to making the most of the Office programs. It’s jam-
packed with how-to’s, advice, shortcuts, and tips. Here’s a bare outline of 
the eight parts of this book:
 
✦ Part I: Common Office Tools: Looks into the many commands and fea-
tures that are common to all or several of the Office programs. Master 
the material in Part I and you will be well on your way to mastering all 
the programs. Part I explains handling text, the proofing tools, charts, 
diagrams, and tables. It explores speed techniques that can make you 
more productive in most of the Office programs, as well as how to draw 
and manipulate lines, shapes, clip art, and other so-called objects.
 
✦ Part II: Word: Explains the numerous features in Office’s word proces-
sor, including how to create documents from letters to reports. Use the 
techniques described here to turn Word into a desktop-publishing pro-
gram and quickly dispatch office tasks such as mass mailings. You also 
discover how to get Word’s help in writing indexes, bibliographies, and 
other items of interest to scholars.
 
✦ Part III: Outlook: Shows you how to send and receive e-mail messages 
and files, as well as track tasks, maintain an address book, and keep a 
calendar with Outlook. If you’re one of those people who receive numer-
ous e-mail messages each day, you will be delighted to discover all the 
ways to track and manage e-mail — and junk e-mail — in Outlook. 
 
✦ Part IV: PowerPoint: Demonstrates how to construct a meaningful pre-
sentation that makes the audience say, “Wow!” Included in Part IV are 
instructions for making a presentation livelier and more original, both 
when you create your presentation and when you deliver it.

2
What Makes This Book Different
 
✦ Part V: Excel: Shows the many different ways to crunch the numbers 
with the bean counter in the Office suite. Along the way, you find out 
how to design worksheets that are easy to read and understand, use 
data-validation rules to cut down on entry mistakes, and analyze 
your data. You find out just how useful Excel can be for financial 
analyses, data tracking, and forecasting.
 
✦ Part VI: Access: Describes how to create a relational database for stor-
ing information, as well as query the database for information and 
gather information into meaningful reports. Don’t be frightened by the 
word “database.” You will be surprised to discover how useful Access 
can be in your work.
 
✦ Part VII: Publisher: Shows how to create brochures, pamphlets, news-
letters, and other publications with the “print shop in a can.”
 
✦ Part VIII: Office — One Step Beyond: For people who want to take 
full advantage of Office, Part VIII delves into customizing the Office 
programs, and recording and running macros. It looks into some aux-
iliary programs that come with Office, including OneNote, the Picture 
Manager, and the Clip Organizer. It also looks into alternative ways 
to distribute your work — in a blog or a Web page, for example, and 
devotes the final chapter to using Office Web Apps, which are the online 
versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Online applications 
are the wave of the future, so be sure to check this chapter out. 
What Makes This Book Different
You are holding in your hands a computer book designed to make mastering 
the Office programs as easy and comfortable as possible. Besides the fact 
that this book is easy to read, it’s different from other books about Office. 
Read on to see why.
Easy-to-look-up information
This book is a reference, and that means that readers have to be able to find 
instructions quickly. To that end, I have taken great pains to make sure that 
the material in this book is well organized and easy to find. The descriptive 
headings help you find information quickly. The bulleted and numbered 
lists make following instructions simpler. The tables make options easier to 
understand and compare.
I want you to be able to look down the page and see in a heading or list the 
name of the topic that concerns you. I want you to be able to find instruc-
tions quickly. Compare the table of contents in this book to the book next to 
it on the bookstore shelf. The table of contents in this book is put together 
better and presents topics so that you can find them in a hurry.

3
Conventions Used in This Book
A task-oriented approach
Most computer books describe what the software is, but this book explains 
how to complete tasks with the software. I assume that you came to this 
book because you want to know how to do something — print form letters, 
create a worksheet, or query a database. You came to the right place. This 
book describes how to get tasks done.
Meaningful screen shots
The screen shots in this book show only the part of the screen that illustrates 
what is being explained in the text. When instructions refer to one part of 
the screen, only that part of the screen is shown. I took great care to make 
sure that the screen shots in this book serve to help you understand the 
Office programs and how they work. Compare this book to the next one on 
the bookstore shelf. Do you see how clean the screen shots in this book are?
Foolish Assumptions
Please forgive me, but I made one or two foolish assumptions about you, the 
reader of this book. I assumed that:
 
✦ You own a copy of Office 2010, the latest edition of Office, and you have 
installed it on your computer.
 
✦ You use a Windows operating system. All people who have the Windows 
operating system installed on their computers are invited to read 
this book. It serves for people who have Windows 7, Windows Vista, 
Windows XP, and Windows NT.
 
✦ You are kind to foreign tourists and small animals.
Conventions Used in This Book
I want you to understand all the instructions in this book, and in that spirit, 
I’ve adopted a few conventions.
Where you see boldface letters or numbers in this book, it means to type 
the letters or numbers. For example, “Enter 25 in the Percentage text box” 
means to do exactly that: Enter the number 25.
Sometimes two tabs on the Ribbon have the same name. To distinguish 
tabs with the same name from one another, I sometimes include one tab’s 
“Tools” heading in parentheses if there could be confusion about which tab 

4
Icons Used in This Book
I’m referring to. In PowerPoint, for example, when you see the words “(Table 
Tools) Design tab,” I’m referring to the Design tab for creating tables, not the 
Design tab for changing a slide’s appearance. (Book I, Chapter 1 describes 
the Ribbon and the tabs in detail.)
To show you how to step through command sequences, I use the ➪ symbol. 
For example, on the Home tab in Word, you can click the Change Styles 
button and choose Style Set➪Distinctive to change the look of a document. 
The ➪ symbol is just a shorthand method of saying “Choose Style Set and 
then choose Distinctive.”
To give most commands, you can press combinations of keys. For example, 
pressing Ctrl+S saves the file you’re working on. In other words, you can hold 
down the Ctrl key and press the S key to save a file. Where you see Ctrl+, Alt+, 
or Shift+ and a key name or key names, press the keys simultaneously.
 
 Yet another way to give a command is to click a button. When I tell you to 
click a button, you see a small illustration of the button in the margin of this 
book (unless the button is too large to fit in the margin). The button shown 
here is the Save button, the one you can click to save a file.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, I’ve placed icons here and there. 
Here’s what the icons mean:
 
Next to the Tip icon, you can find shortcuts and tricks of the trade to make 
your visit to Officeland more enjoyable.
 
Where you see the Warning icon, tread softly and carefully. It means that 
you are about to do something that you may regret later.
 
When I explain a juicy little fact that bears remembering, I mark it with a 
Remember icon. When you see this icon, prick up your ears. You will discover 
something that you need to remember throughout your adventures with 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or the other Office program I am demystifying.
 
When I am forced to describe high-tech stuff, a Technical Stuff icon appears 
in the margin. You don’t have to read what’s beside the Technical Stuff icons 
if you don’t want to, although these technical descriptions often help you 
understand how a software feature works.

5
Good Luck, Reader!
Good Luck, Reader!
If you have a comment about this book, a question, or a shortcut you 
would like to share with me, send an e-mail message to me at this address: 
peterwev@gmail.com. Be advised that I usually can’t answer e-mail right 
away because I’m too darned busy. I do appreciate comments and questions, 
however, because they help me pass my dreary days in captivity.

C
hapter 1 is where you get your feet wet with Office 2010. Walk right to 
the shore and sink your toes in the water. Don’t worry; I won’t push 
you from behind.
In this chapter, you meet the Office programs and discover speed tech-
niques for opening programs and files. I show you around the Ribbon, Quick 
Access toolbar, and other Office program landmarks. I also show you how to 
open files, save files, and clamp a password on a file.
A Survey of Office Programs
Office 2010, sometimes called the Microsoft Office Suite, is a collection of 
computer programs. Why is it called Office? I think because the people who 
invented it wanted to make software for completing tasks that need doing 
in a typical office. When you hear someone talk about “Office” or the “Office 
software,” they’re talking about several different programs:
 
✦ Word: A word processor for writing letters, reports, and so on. A Word 
file is called a document (see Book II).
 
✦ Outlook: A personal information manager, scheduler, and e-mailer (see 
Book III).
 
✦ PowerPoint: A means of creating slide presentations to give in front of 
audiences. A PowerPoint file is called a presentation, or sometimes a 
slide show (see Book IV).

10
Starting an Office Program
 
✦ Excel: A number cruncher for performing numerical analyses. An Excel 
file is called a workbook (see Book V).
 
✦ Access: A database management program (see Book VI).
 
✦ Publisher: A means of creating desktop-publishing files — pamphlets, 
notices, newsletters, and the like (see Book VII).
Office 2010 also comes with the Clip Organizer, for managing and insert-
ing clip-art images in files and managing media files on your computer; the 
Picture Manger, for inserting and editing pictures; and OneNote 2010, a pro-
gram for taking notes and brainstorming. These programs are explained in 
Book VIII.
If you’re new to Office, don’t be daunted by the prospect of having to 
study so many different computer programs. The programs have much in 
common. You find the same commands throughout Office. For example, the 
method of choosing fonts is the same in Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, 
Access, and Publisher. Creating diagrams and charts works the same in 
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Book I describes tasks that are common to all 
or most of the Office programs. Master one Office program and you’re well 
on your way to mastering the next.
Starting an Office Program
Unless you start an Office program, you can’t create a document, construct 
a worksheet, or make a database. Many have tried to undertake these tasks 
with mud and papier-mâché without starting a program first, but all have 
failed. Here are the various and sundry ways to start an Office program:
 
✦ The old-fashioned way: Click the Start button, choose All Programs➪
Microsoft Office, and then choose the program’s name on the submenu.
 
✦ The Start menu: Click the program’s name on the Start menu, as shown 
in Figure 1-1. The Start menu is the menu you see when you click the 
Start button. By placing a program’s name on the Start menu, you can 
open the program simply by clicking the Start button and then clicking 
the program’s name. To place an Office program on the Start menu:
 
1. Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office.
 
2. Move the pointer over the program’s name on the submenu, but 
don’t click to select the program’s name.
 
3. Right-click the program’s name and choose Pin to Start Menu on 
the shortcut menu that appears.
 
 To remove a program’s name from the Start menu, right-click the 
name and choose Remove from This List.

Starting an Office Program
 
Figure 1-1: 
Three of 
several 
ways to 
start an 
Office 
program.
 
Click a program name on the Start menu
Double-click a shortcut icon
Click an icon on the Quick Launch toolbar
 
✦ Desktop shortcut icon: Double-click the program’s shortcut icon (see 
Figure 1-1). A shortcut icon is an icon you can double-click to do some-
thing in a hurry. By creating a shortcut icon on the Windows desktop, 
you can double-click the icon and immediately start an Office program. 
To place an Office shortcut icon on the desktop:
 
1. Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office.
 
2. Move the pointer over the program’s name on the submenu, but 
don’t click the program’s name.
 
3. Right-click the program’s name and choose Send To➪Desktop 
(Create Shortcut) on the shortcut menu that appears.
 
 You can also right-click the name of a program you pinned to the 
Start menu and choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).
 
 To remove a desktop shortcut icon from the Windows desktop, right-
click it, choose Delete, and click Yes in the Delete Shortcut dialog box. 
Don’t worry about deleting a program when you delete its shortcut icon. 
All you do when you choose Delete is remove the program’s shortcut 
icon from the desktop and make your desktop a little less crowded.

12
Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
 
✦ Quick Launch toolbar (Windows Vista and XP only): Click a shortcut 
icon on the Quick Launch toolbar (refer to Figure 1-1). The Quick Launch 
toolbar appears on the Windows taskbar and is easy to find. Wherever 
your work takes you, you can see the Quick Launch toolbar and click 
its shortcut icons to start programs. Create a shortcut icon and follow 
these steps to place a copy of it on the Quick Launch toolbar:
 
1. Click the shortcut icon to select it.
 
2. Hold down the Ctrl key.
 
3. Drag the shortcut icon onto the Quick Launch toolbar.
 
 To change an icon’s position on the toolbar, drag it to the left or the 
right. To remove an icon, right-click it and choose Delete.
Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
Interface, also called the user interface, is a computer term that describes 
how a software program presents itself to the people who use it (and you 
probably thought interface meant two people kissing). These pages give you 
a quick tour of the Office interface and explain what the various parts of 
the interface are. You will be glad to know that the interface of all the 
Office programs is pretty much the same. Click along with me as I describe 
the interface and you’ll know what’s what by the time you finish reading 
these pages.
Yet another way to start an Office program is 
to make the program start automatically when-
ever you turn on your computer. If you’re the 
president of the Office Fan Club and you have 
to run, for example, Outlook each time your 
computer starts, create an Outlook shortcut 
icon and copy it into the Startup folder. Note 
which Windows operating system you have, 
and copy the shortcut icon into the Startup 
folder in one of these locations:
 * Windows 7 and Vista: C:\Users\
Username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup
 * Windows XP: C:\Documents and 
Settings\Username\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup

Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
The File tab
 
 In the upper-left corner of the window is the File tab, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
Go to the File tab to find commands for creating, opening, and saving files, as 
well as doing other file-management tasks. Notice the Options command. 
You can choose Options to open the Options dialog box and tell the program 
you are working in how you want it to work.
 
Figure 1-2: 
The File tab 
and Quick 
Access 
toolbar are 
always 
available.
 
File tab
Quick Access toolbar
 
To leave the File tab, click a different tab on the Ribbon — Home, Insert, or 
another tab. Be sure not to choose the Exit command on the File tab menu. 
Doing so closes the Office program you are working in.
The Quick Access toolbar
No matter where you travel in an Office program, you see the Quick Access 
toolbar in the upper-left corner of the screen (refer to Figure 1-2). This tool-
bar offers three necessary buttons: the all-important Save button, the trusty 
Undo button, and the convenient Repeat button. You can place more buttons 
on the Quick Access toolbar as well as move the toolbar lower in the window. 
I explain how to customize the Quick Access toolbar in Book VIII, Chapter 1.
By the way, Microsoft says that you can call the Quick Access toolbar the 
QAT, or “kwat,” but I don’t think you should do that. Others might think you 
have indigestion.
The Ribbon and its tabs
Across the top of the screen is the Ribbon, an assortment of different tabs; 
click a tab to undertake a task. For example, click the Home tab to format 
text; click the Insert tab to insert a table or chart. Figure 1-3 shows what you 
see in Word when you click the Home, Insert, and Page Layout tabs on the 
Ribbon. Each tab offers a different set of buttons, menus, and galleries.

14
Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
 
Figure 1-3: 
The 
commands 
are different 
on each 
tab on the 
Ribbon.
 
The Ribbon
To visit a tab on the Ribbon, click its name
Practically speaking, your first step when you start a new task is to click a 
tab on the Ribbon. Knowing which tab to click takes awhile, but the names 
of tabs — Home, Insert, View, and so on — hint as to which commands you 
find when you visit a tab.
 
 To make the Ribbon disappear and get more room to view items on-screen, 
click the Minimize the Ribbon button (or press Ctrl+F1). This button is 
located on the right side of the Ribbon, to the left of the Help button. You 
can also right-click the Ribbon and choose Minimize the Ribbon on the 
shortcut menu, or double-click a tab on the Ribbon. To see the Ribbon again, 
click the Minimize the Ribbon button, press Ctrl+F1, double-click a Ribbon 
tab, or right-click a tab name or the Quick Access toolbar and deselect 
Minimize the Ribbon on the shortcut menu. While the Ribbon is minimized, 
you can click a tab name to display a tab.
 
How many buttons appear on some of the tabs depends on the size of your 
monitor screen. On narrow 800 x 600 screens, Office sometimes can’t find 
enough room to display all the buttons on a tab, so it presents you with a 
primary button to click in order to get to the other buttons. Throughout 

Book I
Chapter 1

15
Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
this book, I endeavor to tell you which button you click if your monitor has 
a narrow or a wide screen, but if the instructions in this book tell you to click 
a button and you don’t see it, you have to click a primary button first. Look 
around for the primary button and then click it to get to the secondary button.
Context-sensitive tabs
Sorry for dropping the term context-sensitive on you. I usually steer clear of 
these horrid computer terms, but I can’t help it this time because Microsoft 
calls some tabs context-sensitive, and by golly, I have to call them that, too.
To keep the Ribbon from getting too crowded with tabs, some tabs appear 
only in context — they appear on the Ribbon after you insert or click some-
thing. In Figure 1-4, for example, I inserted a table, and two additional tabs — 
the Design tab and the Layout tab — appear on the Ribbon under the head-
ing “Table Tools.” These context-sensitive tabs offer commands for design-
ing and laying out tables. When I click the (Table Tools) Design tab, as Figure 
1-4 shows, I see commands for putting colors and borders on tables. The 
idea behind context-sensitive tabs is to direct you to the commands you 
need and exclude all other commands.
 
Figure 1-4: 
After you 
insert or 
select 
an item, 
context-
sensitive 
tabs appear

Ribbon.
 
Select or insert an item. . .
and you get context-sensitive tabs

16
Finding Your Way Around the Office Interface
 
If you’re looking for a tab on the Ribbon but can’t find it, the tab is probably 
context-sensitive. You have to insert or select an item to make some tabs 
appear on the Ribbon. Context-sensitive tabs appear on the right side of the 
Ribbon under a heading with the word Tools in its name.
 
Context-sensitive tab names can be confusing because sometimes they 
repeat the names of other tabs. When I refer to a context-sensitive tab name 
in this book, I include its Tools heading in parentheses in case there is any 
confusion about which tab I’m referring to. In PowerPoint, for example, the 
Design tab that always appears on the Ribbon is the Design tab, but the con-
text-sensitive Design tab is the (Table Tools) Design tab.
The anatomy of a tab
All tabs are different in terms of the commands they offer, but all are the 
same insofar as how they present commands. On every tab, you find groups 
and buttons. Some tabs also offer galleries. Groups, buttons, galleries — 
what’s up with that?
Groups
Commands on each tab are organized into groups. The names of these groups 
appear below the buttons and galleries on tabs. For example, the Home tab 
in Excel is organized into several groups, including the Clipboard, Font, 
Alignment, Number, Styles, Cells, and Editing group, as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
Figure 1-5:

buttons.
 
Group names
Group buttons
Groups serve two purposes:
 
✦ Groups tell you what the buttons and galleries above their names are 
used for. On the Home tab in Excel, for example, the buttons in the Font 
group are for formatting text. Read group names to help find the com-
mand you need.
 
✦ Many groups have a group button that you can click to open a dialog 
box or task pane (officially, Microsoft calls these little buttons dialog

box launchers, but let’s act like grownups, shall we?). Group buttons 
are found to the right of group names (refer to Figure 1-5). Moving the 
pointer over a group button opens a pop-up help box with a description 
and picture of the dialog box or task pane that appears when the button 
is clicked.
 
As with tabs on the Ribbon, group buttons are context-sensitive (there’s that 
term again!). Whether you can click a group button to open a dialog box or task 
pane depends on the context in which you’re working. Sometimes the buttons 
are grayed out because they don’t pertain to the task you’re currently doing.
Buttons
Go to any tab and you find buttons of all shapes and sizes. Square buttons 
and rectangular buttons. Big and small buttons. Buttons with labels and but-
tons without labels. Is there any rhyme or reason to these button shapes 
and sizes? No, there isn’t.
What matters isn’t a button’s shape or size, but whether a down-pointing 
arrow appears on its face:
 
 
✦ A button with an arrow: Click a button with an arrow and you get a 
drop-down list with options you can select.
 
 
✦ A button without an arrow: Click a button without an arrow and you 
complete an action of some kind.
 
 
✦ A hybrid button with an arrow: Some buttons serve a dual purpose as a 
button and a drop-down list. By clicking the symbol on the top half of 
the button, you complete an action; by clicking the arrow on the bottom 
half of the button, you open a drop-down list. On the Home tab, for 
example, clicking the top half of the Paste button pastes what is on the 
Clipboard into your file, but clicking the bottom half of the button opens 
a drop-down list with Paste options.
 
You can find out what clicking a button does by moving the pointer over it. 
You see a pop-up description of what the button is for.
Galleries
Built into some tabs are galleries like the one shown in Figure 1-6. The gal-
lery in the figure pertains to charts: The Chart Styles gallery is for format-
ting charts. A gallery presents you with visual options for changing an item. 
When you move the pointer over a gallery choice, the item on your page or 
slide — the table, chart, or diagram, for example — changes appearance. 
In this way, you can preview different choices before you click to select the 
choice you want.

18

Click the More button to open the gallery in a drop-down list
To view and make choices on a gallery:
 
✦ Move the pointer over gallery choices and watch how the item or items 
on-screen change.
 
✦ Click a scroll arrow to see more gallery choices on the tab.
 
✦ Click the More button (refer to Figure 1-6) to open the gallery choices in 
a drop-down list and see many choices simultaneously.
 
✦ Click a gallery choice to apply it.
Live previewing
Thanks to live previewing, you can see the results of a menu or gallery 
choice before actually making the choice. Here’s how live previewing works: 
Move the pointer over an option in a gallery or drop-down list and glance at 
your page or slide. You can see the results of selecting the option. For exam-
ple, you see a different font or shape color. You can judge whether choosing 
the option is worthwhile without choosing the option first. Live previewing 
liberates you from repeatedly choosing commands, backtracking, and trying 
again until you get it right.

Mini-toolbars
A mini-toolbar is a ghostlike toolbar that appears on-screen to help you do 
a task, as shown in Figure 1-7. Move the pointer over the mini-toolbar, and 
it ceases being ghostlike, as Figure 1-7 demonstrates. Now you can select an 
option from a drop-down list or click a button on the mini-toolbar to complete 
a task.
 
Figure 1-7: 
Move the 
pointer 
over the 
mini-toolbar 
to make it 
come alive.
 
 
The mini-toolbar, shown in Figure 1-7, appears when you select text and then 
move the pointer over selected text. Don’t be frightened of these ghostlike 
mini-toolbars. Keep your eyes open for them. Mini-toolbars are very convenient, 
and they save you the trouble of going to a different tab to complete a task.
Office 2010 for keyboard lovers
People who like to give commands by pressing keyboard shortcuts may well 
ask, “Where are the keyboard shortcuts in Office?” The answer is: They’re 
still there. For example, you can press Ctrl+B to boldface text and Ctrl+U to 
underline text. 
Office offers Alt+key shortcuts as well. Press the Alt key and letters — they’re 
called KeyTips — appear on tab names, as shown in Figure 1-8. After you 
press the Alt key, follow these instructions to make use of KeyTips:
Similar to mini-toolbars are the shortcut menus 
you get when you right-click. Right-click means 
to click the right, not the left, mouse button. 
Right-click just about anywhere and you get 
a shortcut menu of some kind. The shortcut 
menus differ, depending on what you right-click.
Right-clicking sometimes gets you to the com-
mand you need without having to select a 
different tab. I right-click more than usual in 
Office to keep from switching from tab to tab 
on the Ribbon.

Saving Your Files
Soon after you create a new file, be sure to save it. And save your file from 
time to time while you work on it as well. Until you save your work, it rests 
in the computer’s electronic memory (RAM), a precarious location. If a 
power outage occurs or your computer stalls, you lose all the work you did 
since the last time you saved your file. Make it a habit to save files every ten 
minutes or so or when you complete an important task.
These pages explain how to save a file, name a file, choose the folder where 
you want to save a file, declare where you want to save files by default, save 
files for use in 97–2003 editions of Office, and handle files that were saved 
automatically after a computer failure.
Saving a file
To save a file:
 
 
✦ Click the Save button (you find it on the Quick Access toolbar).
 
✦ Press Ctrl+S.
 
 
✦ Go to the File tab and choose Save.
Saving a file for the first time
The first time you save a presentation, the Save As dialog box opens. It 
invites you to give the file a name and choose a folder in which to store it. 
Enter a descriptive name in the File Name text box. To locate a folder for 
storing your presentation, see “Navigating the Save As and Open Dialog 
Boxes,” later in this chapter.

Saving Your Files
Declaring where you like to save files
When you attempt to save a file for the first time in the Save As dialog 
box, Office shows you the contents of the Document folder (in Windows 7 
and Windows Vista) or the My Documents folder (in Windows XP) on the 
assumption that you keep most of your files in that folder. The Documents 
folder is the center of the universe as far as Office is concerned, but perhaps 
you keep the majority of your files in a different folder. How would you like 
to see it first in the Save As and Open dialog boxes?
To direct Office to the folder you like best and make it appear first in the 
Save As and Open dialog boxes, follow these steps:
 
 1. In Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access, go to the File tab and choose 
Options.
 
 You see the Options dialog box.
 
2. In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, select the Save category; in Access, 
select the General category.
 
 Figure 1-9 shows the topmost options in this category.
 
3. In the Default File Location (or Default Database Folder) text box, 
enter the address of the folder where you prefer to keep your files.
 
 For example, if you’re fond of keeping files in the My Stuff folder on the 
C drive of your computer, enter C:\My Stuff, or click the Browse button 
(if it’s available) and select the My Stuff folder in the Modify Location 
dialog box.
 
4. Click OK.

dialog box.
 
Saving files for use in earlier versions 
of an Office program
Not everyone is a proud owner of Office 2010. Before you pass along a file 
to a co-worker who has Office 2003, XP, 2000, or 97, save your document so 
that your co-worker can open it. People with versions of Office prior to ver-
sion 2010 and 2007 cannot open your Office files unless you save your files 
for earlier versions of Office.

22
Saving Your Files
 
You can tell whether a Word, PowerPoint, Access, or Excel file is formatted 
for a 2010 program or an earlier version of the program by glancing at its file 
extension. PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and Word files have four-letter, not 
three-letter file extensions. Table 1-1 lists Office program file extensions.

Saving a file for use in Office 97–2003
Follow these steps to save a file so that someone with Office 97, 2000, XP, or 
2003 can open it:
 
 1. Go to the File tab.
 
2. Choose Save & Send.
 
 You see the Share window.
 
3. Under File Types, choose Change File Type and then choose the 
97–2003 option for saving files.
 
 The Save As dialog box opens.
 
4. Enter a new name for the file, if necessary.
 
5. Click the Save button.
 
 You can tell when you’re working on a file saved in the 97–2003 format 
because the words “Compatibility Mode” appear in the title bar next to 
the file’s name. The title bar is located at the top of the screen.
 
Files saved in the 97–2003 format have a different file extension. Rather than 
a four-letter file extension that ends in x, they have a three-letter extension 
without the x (see Table 1-1, shown previously).
Saving files by default for earlier versions of Office
If you’re way ahead of the pack and you always have to save files in a differ-
ent format so that co-workers can open them, make the different format the 
default format for saving all your files. That way, you don’t have to choose a 
new format whenever you pass along a file to a co-worker.

Book I
Chapter 1
Office Nuts

23
Saving Your Files
Follow these steps to change the default format for saving files:
 
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Options.
 
 The Options dialog box appears.
 
2. In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, select the Save category; in Access, 
select the General category.
 
3. In the Save Files in This Format drop-down list, choose the 97–2003 
format.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Remember that you made 97–2003 the default format for saving files. At 
some point, when the world catches up to you and 97–2003 files have 
become obsolete, return to the Options dialog box and choose the most 
up-to-date format.
Saving AutoRecovery information
To insure against data loss due to computer and power failures, Office saves 
files on its own every ten minutes. These files are saved in an AutoRecovery 
file. After your computer fails, you can try to recover some of the work you 
lost by getting it from the AutoRecovery file (see the sidebar “When disaster 
strikes!”).
When you open a file made in an earlier ver-
sion of Office, the program switches to com-
patibility mode. Features that weren’t part of 
earlier versions of the program are shut down. 
You can tell when a file is in compatibility mode 
because the words Compatibility Mode appear 
in the title bar next to the file’s name.
Follow these steps to convert a 97–2003 file for 
use in an Office 2010 program:
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Convert.
 
 A dialog box informs you what converting 
means. If you don’t see the Convert option, 
your file has been converted already.
 2. Click OK.
Converting Office 97–2003 files to 2010

24
Saving Your Files
After your computer fails and you restart 
an Office program, you see the Document 
Recovery task pane with a list of files that were 
open when the failure occurred:
 ✓ AutoSave files are files that Office saves 
as part of its AutoRecovery procedure (see 
“Saving AutoRecovery information”).
 ✓ Original files are files that you save by 
clicking the Save button.
The Document Recovery task pane tells you 
when each file was saved. By studying the time 
listings, you can tell which version of a file — 
the AutoRecovery file or the file you saved — is 
most up-to-date.
Open the drop-down list for a file and select 
one of these options:
 ✓ View: Opens the file so that you can exam-
ine and work on it. If you want to keep it, 
click the Save button.
 ✓ Save As: Opens the Save As dialog box so 
that you can save the file under a differ-
ent name. Choose this command to keep a 
copy of the recovered file on hand in case 
you need it.
 ✓ Close: Closes the file.
 ✓ Show Repairs: Shows repairs made to the 
file (for use with repaired Word documents).
When disaster strikes!
Office saves AutoRecovery files every ten minutes, but if you want the 
program to save the files more or less frequently, you can change the 
AutoRecovery setting. Auto-recovering taxes a computer’s memory. If your 
computer is sluggish, consider making AutoRecovery files at intervals longer 
than ten minutes; if your computer fails often and you’re worried about 
losing data, make AutoRecovery files more frequently.
Follow these steps to tell Office how often to save data in an AutoRecovery file:

Navigating the Save As and Open Dialog Boxes
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Options.
 
 The Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Select the Save category (refer to Figure 1-9).
 
3. Enter a Minutes setting in the Save AutoRecover Information Every box.
 
4. Click OK.
Navigating the Save As and Open Dialog Boxes
The Open dialog box and Save As dialog box offer a bunch of different ways 
to locate a file you want to open or locate the folder where you want to save 
a file. Figure 1-10 shows the Open dialog box. I’m happy to report that both 
dialog boxes, Open and Save As, work the same way.
 
✦ Retracing your search: Click the Back and Forward buttons (or open the 
drop-down list on the Back button) to retrace your search for a folder or 
revisit a folder you previously visited.

Opening and Closing Files
 
✦ Searching for files in a folder: Use the Search box to search for subfold-
ers and files in the folder you’re currently viewing. After you type the 
first few letters of a filename or subfolder, you see only the names of 
items that start with the letters you typed. To see all the files and sub-
folders again, click the Close button (the X) in the Search box.
 
✦ Changing views: Display folder contents differently by choosing a view 
on the Views drop-down list (in Windows 7, look for the View arrow in 
the upper-right corner of the dialog box). In Details view, you see how 
large files are and when they were last edited.
 
✦ Creating a new folder: Click the New Folder button to create a new 
subfolder for storing files. Select the folder that your new folder will be 
subordinate to and click the New Folder button. Then type a name for 
the saved file.
 
✦ Open one of your favorite folders (Windows Vista): Select a folder 
in the Favorite Links list to see its contents. Later in this chapter, the 
“Putting a favorite folder on the Favorite list” sidebar explains how to 
place the name of a folder in the list.
 
✦ Navigate to different folders: Click the Folders bar (in the lower-left 
corner of the dialog box) to open the Navigation pane and look for fold-
ers or presentations on a different drive, network location, or folder 
on your computer. If you don’t see the Folders bar, click the Organize 
button and choose Layout➪Navigation Pane.
Opening and Closing Files
To get to work on a file, you have to open it first. And, of course, you close a 
file when you’re finished working on it and want to stop and smell the roses. 
The Favorites list (or Favorite Links list) in 
the Open dialog box and Save As dialog box 
gives you the opportunity to go lickety-split to 
a folder on your computer or network. All you 
have to do is click a folder name on the list 
to see the contents of the folder. If there’s a 
particular folder you visit often that deserves 
“favorite” status, you can put that folder on the 
Favorites list by following these steps:
 1. In the Open or Save As dialog box, locate 
and select the folder that you want to be a 
favorite.
 2. Drag the folder into the Favorites list. 
That’s right — just drag it. Moreover, you 
can slide it up or down the list to put it 
where you are most likely to find it.
To remove a folder from the Favorites list, right-
click it and choose Remove Link.

Opening and Closing Files
The following pages explain all the intricate details of opening and closing 
files. In these pages, you find many tips for finding and opening the file you 
want to work on.
Opening a file
Between the two of them, Office and Windows offer many shortcuts for open-
ing files. To open a file, take the standard route — go to the File tab and 
choose Open — or take advantage of the numerous ways to open files quickly.
The slow, conventional way to open a file
If you can’t open a file by any other means, you have to resort to the Open 
dialog box:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Open (or press Ctrl+O).
 
 You see the Open dialog box (refer to Figure 1-10).
 
2. Locate and select the file you want to open.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Navigating the Save As and Open Dialog Boxes” 
offers some tricks for locating a file in the Open dialog box.
 
3. Click the Open button.
 
 Your file opens. You can also double-click a filename to open a file.
Speed techniques for opening files
As shown in Figure 1-11, the fastest way to open a file is to go to the File tab, 
choose Recent, and choose the file’s name on the Recent Documents list. 
This list shows the names of the last 22 files you opened. By moving the 
pointer over a name, you can see which folder a file is stored in. Click the pin 
next to a name to make the name remain on the list even if it isn’t one of the 
last several files you opened (click the pin a second time to “unpin” a name).
 
To make more (or fewer) than 22 filenames appear on the Recent Documents 
list, go the File tab in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, and choose Options. In the 
Options dialog box, visit the Advanced category, scroll to the Display section, 
and enter a number in the Show This Number of Recent Documents text box.
Here are other speed techniques for opening files:
 
✦ In Windows Explorer or Computer: Locate the file in one of these file-
management programs and double-click its name.
 
✦ Shortcut icon: Create a shortcut icon to a file and place the icon on the 
Windows desktop. In Windows Explorer or the Open dialog box, right-
click the file’s name and choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut). To 
quickly open the file, double-click its shortcut icon on the desktop.

Click to “pin” a name to the list
Closing a file
Closing a file is certainly easier than opening one. To close a file, save your 
file and use one of these techniques:
 
✦ On the File tab, choose Close. The program remains open although the 
file is closed.
 
✦ Click the Close button — the X in the upper-right corner of the window. 
(Alternatively, press Alt+F4.) Clicking the Close button closes the pro-
gram as well as the file.
 
✦ Click the program icon (in the upper-left corner of the screen) and 
choose Close.
If you try to close a file without first saving it, a message box asks whether 
ditching your file is in your best interests, and you get a chance to click 
Save in the message box and save your file. Sometimes closing a file without 
saving the changes you made to it is worthwhile. If you made a bunch of edi-
torial mistakes and want to start over, you can close the file without saving 
the changes you made. Next time you open the file, you see the version that 
you had before you made all those mistakes.
Reading and Recording File Properties
Properties are a means of describing a file. If you manage two dozen or more 
files, you owe it to yourself to record properties. You can use them later to 
identify files.

To record even more descriptions, click the Properties button and choose 
one of these commands on the drop-down list:
 
✦ Show Document Panel: The Document Properties panel appears so that 
you can enter more descriptions and comments.
 
✦ Advanced Properties: The Properties dialog box appears. Enter infor-
mation about your file on the Summary and Custom tab.
You can read a file’s properties without opening a file. In Windows Explorer, 
Computer, or the Open dialog box, right-click a file’s name and choose 
Properties. You see the Properties dialog box. Go to the Details tab to see 
descriptions you entered.
 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint offer a command for erasing document properties. 
On the File tab, choose Info, click the Check for Issues button, and choose Inspect 
Document. In the Document Inspector dialog box, click the Inspect button, and 
then click the Remove All button if you want to remove document properties.
Locking a File with a Password
Perhaps you want to submit your file to others for critical review but you 
don’t want any Tom, Dick, or Harry to look at your file. In that case, lock 
your file with a password and give out the password only to people whose 
opinions you trust. These pages explain how to password-protect a file, open 
a file that is locked with a password, and remove the password from a file.

30
Locking a File with a Password
Password-protecting a file
Follow these steps to clamp a password on a file, such that others need a 
password to open and perhaps also edit it:
 
 1. Go to the File tab.
 
2. In the Information window, click the Protect Document (or Workbook) 
button, and choose Encrypt with Password on the drop-down list.
 
 The Encrypt Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-13.
 
Figure 1-13: 
Enter 
passwords 
for the file 
in this 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Enter a password in the Password text box and click OK.
 
 Others will need the password you enter to open the file. No ifs, ands, or 
buts. They have to enter the password.
 
 Passwords are case-sensitive. In other words, you have to enter the cor-
rect combination of upper- and lowercase letters to successfully enter 
the password. If the password is Valparaiso (with an uppercase V), 
entering valparaiso (with a lowercase v) is deemed the wrong password 
and doesn’t open the file.
 
4. In the Confirm Password dialog box, enter the password again.
 
 Figure 1-13 shows the Confirm Password dialog box
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Information window informs you that a password is required to 
open the file.
Removing a password from a file
Follow these steps to remove a password from a file:
 
1. Open the file that needs its password removed.
 
 2. Go to the File tab, and in the Information window, click the Protect 
Document button, and choose Encrypt with Password.
 
 The Encrypt Document dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-13).
 
3. Delete the password and click OK.

Everybody knows that. But not everyone knows all the different ways 
to change the look and size of text in an Office 2010 file. In this chapter, I 
explain how to do that as well as how to move, copy, and delete text. You 
find out how to quickly change a letter’s case, enter a symbol or foreign 
character, and find and replace text in a file. Finally, I show you how to link 
your files to the Internet by fashioning a hyperlink.
Manipulating the Text
This short but important part of Chapter 2 describes the many techniques 
for selecting, deleting, copying, and moving text. You find an inordinate 
number of tips on these pages because there are so many shortcuts for 
manipulating text. Master the many shortcuts and you cut down consider-
ably on the time you spend editing text.
Selecting text
Before you can do anything to text — move it, boldface it, delete it, translate 
it — you have to select it. Here are speed techniques for selecting text:

32
Manipulating the Text
To Select
Do This
A word
Double-click the word.
A few words
Drag over the words.
A paragraph
Triple-click inside the paragraph (in Word, PowerPoint, 
and Outlook messages).
A block of text
Click the start of the text, hold down the Shift key, and 
click the end of the text. In Word you can also click the 
start of the text, press F8, and click at the end of the text.
All text
Press Ctrl+A.
 
Word offers a special command for selecting text with similar formats 
throughout a document. You can use this command to make wholesale 
changes to text. Select an example of the text that needs changing, and on 
the Home tab, click the Select button and choose Select Text with Similar 
Formatting (you may have to click the Editing button first). Then choose for-
matting commands to change all instances of the text that you selected.
Moving and copying text
Office offers a number of different ways to move and copy text from place 
to place. Drum roll, please. . . . Select the text you want to move or copy and 
then use one of these techniques to move or copy it:
 
✦ Dragging and dropping: Move the mouse over the text and then click 
and drag the text to a new location. Drag means to hold down the mouse 
button while you move the pointer on-screen. If you want to copy rather 
than move the text, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag.
 
✦ Dragging and dropping with the right mouse button: Drag the text 
while holding down the right, not the left, mouse button. After you 
release the right mouse button, a shortcut menu appears with Move 
Here and Copy Here options. Choose an option to move or copy the text.
 
✦ Using the Clipboard: Move or copy the text to the Clipboard by click-
ing the Cut or Copy button, pressing Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C, or right-clicking 
and choosing Cut or Copy on the shortcut menu. The text is moved 
or copied to an electronic holding tank called the Clipboard. Paste the 
text by clicking the Paste button, pressing Ctrl+V, or right-clicking and 
choosing Paste. You can find the Paste, Cut, and Copy buttons on the 
Home tab.

Taking advantage of the Clipboard task pane
The Windows Clipboard is a piece of work. After you copy or cut text 
with the Cut or Copy command, the text is placed on the Clipboard. The 
Clipboard holds the last 24 items that you cut or copied. You can open 
the Clipboard task pane and view the last 24 items you cut or copied to the 
Clipboard and cut or copy them anew, as shown in Figure 2-1.
To open the Clipboard task pane, go to the Home tab and click the Clipboard 
group button (it’s to the right of the word Clipboard). Icons next to the items tell 
you where they came from. To copy an item, click it or open its drop-down list 
and choose Paste. The Clipboard is available to all Office programs; it’s espe-
cially useful for copying text and graphics from one Office program to another.
Text adopts the formatting of neighboring 
text when you move or copy it to a new 
location. Using the Paste options, how-
ever, you can decide for yourself what hap-
pens to text formatting when you move or copy 
text from one place to another. To avail your-
self of the Paste options:
 ✓ On the Home tab, open the drop-down 
list on the Paste button to see the Paste 
Options submenu.
 ✓ Right-click to see the Paste options on the 
shortcut menu.
Click the Paste Options button to 
open the Paste Options submenu. 
This button appears after you paste text by 
clicking the Paste button or pressing 
Ctrl+V.
Choose a Paste option to determine what hap-
pens to text formatting when you move or copy 
text to a new location:
Keep Source Formatting: The text 
keeps its original formatting. Choose 
this option to move or copy text format-
ting along with text to a different location.
Merge Formatting (Word only): The 
text adopts the formatting of the text to 
where it is moved or copied.
Use Destination Theme (Word only): 
The text adopts the formatting of the 
theme you chose for your document (if 
you chose a theme).
Keep Text Only: The text is stripped of 
all formatting.
Some people think that the Paste Options 
button is a bother. If you’re one of those people, 
go to the File tab and choose Options. You see 
the Options dialog box. Go to the Advanced 
category and deselect the Show Paste Options 
Buttons When Content Is Pasted check box.

The Options pop-up list at the bottom of the Clipboard task pane offers 
these options:
 
✦ Show Office Clipboard Automatically: Choose this option if you want 
the Clipboard task pane to open automatically when you cut or copy 
two items consecutively or you copy the same item twice.
 
✦ Show Office Clipboard When Ctrl+C Pressed Twice: Choose this option 
if you want to open the Clipboard task pane by pressing Ctrl+C and 
Ctrl+C again.
 
✦ Collect Without Showing Office Clipboard: Choose this option to be 
notified when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by an icon 
in the system tray and/or a pop-up notice. To be notified, you must have 
selected either or both of the preceding two options on the Options menu.
 
✦ Show Office Clipboard Icon on Taskbar: Choose this option to be noti-
fied when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by an icon in 
the system tray, the part of the Windows taskbar by the clock. (The icon 
appears after you cut or copy the first item to the Clipboard.) You can 
double-click the icon to open the Clipboard task pane. After an item is 
cut or copied to the Clipboard, a tiny page glides across the icon.
 
✦ Show Status Near Taskbar When Copying: Choose this option to be 
notified when an item has been cut or copied to the Clipboard by a 
pop-up notice in the lower-right corner of the screen. It tells you how 
many items have been collected on the Clipboard.
Deleting text
To delete a bunch of text simultaneously, select the text you want to delete 
and press the Delete key. By the way, you can kill two birds with one stone

by selecting text and then starting to type. The letters you type immediately 
take the place of and delete the text you selected.
 
You can always click the Undo button (or press Ctrl+Z) if you regret deleting 
text. This button is located on the Quick Access toolbar.
Changing the Look of Text
What text looks like is determined by its font, the size of the letters, the 
color of the letters, and whether text effects or font styles such as italic 
or boldface are in the text. The text’s appearance really matters in Word, 
PowerPoint, and Publisher because files you create in those programs are 
meant to be read by all and sundry. Even in Excel, Access, and Outlook mes-
sages, however, font choices matter because the choices you make deter-
mine whether your work is easy to read and understand.
A font is a collection of letters, numbers, and symbols in a particular typeface, 
including all italic and boldface variations of the letters, numbers, and sym-
bols. Fonts have beautiful names and some of them are many centuries old. 
Most computers come with these fonts: Arial, Tahoma, Times New Roman, and 
Verdana. By default, Office often applies the Calibri and Cambria fonts to text.
When you’re in a hurry to change the look of 
text and reformat paragraphs, consider using 
the Format Painter. This nifty tool works some-
thing like a paintbrush. You drag it over text to 
copy formats from place to place. Follow these 
instructions to use the Format Painter:
 1. Click a place with text and paragraph for-
mats that you want to copy elsewhere (or 
select the text).
 2. On the Home tab (or the Format Text tab in an 
Outlook message), click or double-click the 
Format Painter button (or press Ctrl+Shift+C).
You can find the Format Painter button 
in the Clipboard group. Click the button 
to copy formats once; double-click to 
copy formats to more than one location. 
The pointer changes into a paintbrush.
 3. Drag the pointer across text to which you 
want to copy the formats.
 
 You can go from place to place with the 
Format Painter.
 4. Click the Format Painter button a second 
time or press Esc when you’re finished 
with the Format Painter.
 
 Press Esc or click the Format Painter button 
again to cease using the Format Painter if 
you used it to copy formats to more than 
one location.
At the opposite end of the spectrum 
from the Format Painter button is the 
Clear Formatting button on the Home 
tab. You can select text and click this button to 
strip text of all its formats, whatever they may be.
Format Painter: A fast way 
to change the look of text

Changing the Look of Text
Font styles include boldface, italic, and underline. By convention, headings 
are boldface. Italics are used for emphasis and to mark foreign words in text. 
Office provides a number of text effects. Text effects, also known as text attri-
butes, include strikethrough and superscript. Use text effects sparingly.
The following pages look at the different ways to change the font, font size, 
and color of text, as well as how to assign font styles and text effects to text.
Choosing fonts for text
If you aren’t happy with the fonts you chose, select the text that needs a font 
change and change fonts with one of these techniques:
 
✦ Mini-toolbar: Move the pointer over the selected text. You see the mini-
toolbar. Move the pointer over this toolbar and choose a font in the Font 
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
✦ Shortcut menu: Right-click the selected text and choose a new font on 
the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Font drop-down list: On the Home tab, open the Font drop-down list and 
choose a font.
 
✦ Font dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Font group button. You see 
the Font dialog box. Select a font and click OK.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Changing 
fonts by way 
of the mini-
toolbar.
 
 
 Another way to change fonts is to select a different theme font. In the Page 
Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Design tab (in PowerPoint), open the 
drop-down list on the Theme Fonts button and choose a font combination.

Avoid using too many different fonts because a file with too many fonts looks 
like alphabet soup. The object is to choose a font that helps set the tone. An 
aggressive sales pitch calls for a strong, bold font; a technical presentation 
calls for a font that is clean and unobtrusive. Make sure that the fonts you 
select help communicate your message.
Changing the font size of text
Font size is measured in points; a point is 1⁄72 of an inch. The golden rule 
of font sizes goes something like this: the larger the font size, the more 
If Windows is installed on your computer, so 
are many different fonts. The names of these 
fonts appear on the Font drop-down list, Font 
dialog box, and mini-toolbar. Do you have 
enough fonts on your computer? Do you want 
to remove fonts to keep the Font drop-down list 
from being overcrowded?
Font files are kept in the C:\Windows\Fonts 
folder on your computer. You can double-click 
the Fonts icon in the Control Panel to open this 
folder. Here are instructions for handling fonts:
 ✓ Installing new fonts: Place the font file in 
the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
 ✓ Removing a font: Move the font file out of 
the C:\Windows\Fonts folder. Store 
font files you don’t want in another folder 
where you can resuscitate them if need be.
 ✓ Examining fonts: Double-click a font file 
to examine a font more closely. A window 
opens, and you see precisely what the 
font looks like. Do you know why “The 
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” 
appears in this window? Because that sen-
tence includes every letter in the alphabet.
Installing and removing fonts on your computer

Changing the Look of Text
important the text. This is why headings are larger than footnotes. Select your 
text and use one of these techniques to change the font size of the letters:
 
✦ Mini-toolbar: Move the pointer over the text, and when you see the mini-
toolbar, move the pointer over the toolbar and choose a font size on the 
Font Size drop-down list (refer to Figure 2-2).
 
✦ Shortcut menu: Right-click the text and choose a new font size on the 
shortcut menu.
 
✦ Font Size drop-down list: On the Home tab, open the Font Size drop-
down list and choose a font. You can live-preview font sizes this way.
 
✦ Font dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Font group button, and in 
the Font dialog box, choose a font size and click OK.
 
 
✦ Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons: Click these buttons 
(or press Ctrl+] or Ctrl+[) to increase or decrease the point size by the 
next interval on the Font Size drop-down list. You can find the Increase 
Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons on the Home tab and the mini-
toolbar. Watch the Font Size list or your text and note how the text changes 
size. This is an excellent technique when you want to “eyeball it” and you 
don’t care to fool with the Font Size drop-down list or Font dialog box.
 
Click the Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons when you’re 
dealing with fonts of different sizes and you want to proportionally change 
the size of all the letters. Drag the pointer over the text to select it before 
clicking one of the buttons.
 
If the font size you want isn’t on the Font Size drop-down list, enter the size. 
For example, to change the font size to 13.5 points, type 13.5 in the Font Size 
box and press Enter.
Applying font styles to text
There are four — count ’em, four — font styles: regular, bold, italic, and 
underline:
 
✦ Regular: This style is just Office’s way of denoting an absence of any 
font style.
 
 
✦ Italic: Italics are used for emphasis, when introducing a new term, and 
to mark foreign words such as violà, gung hay fat choy, and Qué magnif-
ico! You can also italicize titles to make them a little more elegant.
 
 
✦ Bold: Bold text calls attention to itself.
 
 
✦ Underline: Underlined text also calls attention to itself, but use underlin-
ing sparingly. Later in this chapter, “Underlining text” looks at all the 
ways to underline text.

Book I
Chapter 2
Wrestling with

39
Changing the Look of Text
Select text and use one of these techniques to apply a font style to it:
 
✦ Home tab: Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline button.
 
✦ Keyboard: Press Ctrl+B to boldface text, Ctrl+I to italicize it, or Ctrl+U to 
underline it.
 
✦ Mini-toolbar: The mini-toolbar offers the Bold, Italic, and Underline 
button.
 
✦ Font dialog box: Select a Font Style option in the Font dialog box. To 
open this dialog box, visit the Home tab and click the Font group button.
To remove a font style, click the Bold, Italic, or Underline button a second 
time. You can also select text and then click the Clear Formatting button on 
the Home tab (in Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher).
Applying text effects to text
Text effects have various uses, some utilitarian and some strictly for yucks. 
Be careful with text effects. Use them sparingly and to good purpose. To 
apply a text effect, start on the Home tab (or the Format Text tab in Outlook 
messages) and do one of the following:
 
✦ Click a text effect button on the Home tab.
 
✦ Click the Font group button and choose a text effect in the bottom half 
of the Font dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3:

dialog box 
(Word).
 

40
Changing the Look of Text
Here’s a rundown of the different text effects (not all these effects are avail-
able in PowerPoint, Excel, Publisher, and Outlook):
 
 
✦ Strikethrough and double strikethrough: By convention, strikethrough 
is used to show where passages are struck from a contract or other 
important document. Double strikethrough, for all I know, is used to 
shows where passages are struck out forcefully. Use these text effects to 
demonstrate ideas that you reject.
 
 
✦ Subscript: A subscripted letter is lowered in the text. In this chemical 
formula, the 2 is lowered to show that two atoms of hydrogen are 
needed along with one atom of oxygen to form a molecule of water: 
H2O. (Press Ctrl+=.)
 
 
✦ Superscript: A superscripted letter or number is one that is raised in the 
text. Superscript is used in mathematical and scientific formulas, in ordi-
nal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and to mark footnotes. In the theory of relativ-
ity, the 2 is superscripted: E = mc2. (Press Ctrl+Shift+plus sign.)
 
✦ Small Caps: A small cap is a small capital letter. You can find many cre-
ative uses for small caps. An all-small-cap title looks elegant. Be sure to 
type lowercase letters in order to create small caps. Type an uppercase 
letter, and Office refuses to turn it into a small cap. Not all fonts can pro-
duce small capital letters.
 
✦ All Caps: The All Caps text effect merely capitalizes all letters. Use it in 
styles to make sure that you enter text in all capital letters.
 
✦ Equalize Character Height (PowerPoint only): This effect makes all 
characters the same height and stretches the characters in text. You can 
use it to produce interesting effects in text box announcements.
Underlining text
You can choose from 15 ways to underline text, with styles ranging from 
Words Only to Wavy Line, and you can select a color for the underline in 
Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook. If you decide to underline titles, do it con-
sistently. To underline text, select the text that you want to underline, go to 
the Home tab, and pick your poison:
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Underline button. A single line runs under all 
the words you selected. In Word, you can open the drop-down list on 
the Underline button and choose from several ways to underline text.
 
✦ Click the Font group button to open the Font dialog box (refer to Figure 
2-3) and then choose an underline style from the drop-down list. You 
can also choose an underline color from the Underline Color drop-down 
list (in Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook). The color you select applies to 
the underline, not to the words being underlined.
To remove an underline from text, select the text and then click the 
Underline button on the Home tab.

Quick Ways to Handle Case, or Capitalization
Changing the color of text
Before you change the color of text, peer at your computer screen and exam-
ine the background theme or color you chose. Unless the color of the text is 
different from the theme or color, you can’t read the text. Besides choosing a 
color that contributes to the overall tone, choose a color that is easy to read.
Select the text that needs touching up and use one of these techniques to 
change its color:
 
 
✦ On the mini-toolbar, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button 
and choose a color, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Choosing a 
font color 
on the mini-
toolbar.
 
 
✦ Right-click, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button, and 
choose a color on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button and 
choose a color.
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Font group button to open the Font dialog 
box, open the Font Color drop-down list, and choose a color.
The Font Color drop-down list offers theme colors and standard colors. You 
are well advised to choose a theme color. These colors are deemed theme 
colors because they jive with the theme you choose for your file.
Quick Ways to Handle Case, or Capitalization
Case refers to how letters are capitalized in words and sentences. Table 2-1 
explains the different cases, and Figure 2-5 demonstrates why paying atten-
tion to case matters. In the figure, the PowerPoint slide titles are presented 
using different cases, and the titles are inconsistent with one another. In one 
slide, only the first letter in the title is capitalized (sentence case); in another 
slide, the first letter in each word is capitalized (capitalize each word); in 
another, none of the letters is capitalized (lowercase); and in another, all the 
letters are capitalized (uppercase). In your titles and headings, decide on a 
capitalization scheme and stick with it for consistency’s sake.

✦ lowercase: Makes all the letters lowercase.
 
✦ UPPERCASE: Renders all the letters as capital letters.

Entering Symbols and Foreign Characters
 
✦ Capitalize Each Word: Capitalizes the first letter in each word. If you 
choose this option for a title or heading, go into the title and lowercase 
the first letter of articles (the, a, an), coordinate conjunctions (and, or, 
for, nor), and prepositions unless they’re the first or last word in the title.
 
✦ tOGGLE cASE: Choose this option if you accidentally enter letters with 
the Caps Lock key pressed.
 
You can also change case by pressing Shift+F3. Pressing this key combina-
tion in Word and PowerPoint changes characters to uppercase, lowercase, 
each word capitalized, and back to uppercase again.
Entering Symbols and Foreign Characters
Don’t panic if you need to enter an umlaut, grave accent, or cedilla because 
you can do it by way of the Symbol dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-6. You 
can enter just about any symbol and foreign character by way of this dialog 
box. Click where you want to enter a symbol or foreign character and follow 
these steps to enter it:
 
Figure 2-6: 
To enter 
a symbol 
or foreign 
character, 
select it 
and click 
the Insert 
button.
 
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the Symbol button. (You may have to click the 
Symbols button first, depending on the size of your screen.)
 
 In Word, Outlook, and Publisher, click More Symbols after you click the 
Symbol button if no symbol on the drop-down list does the job for you. 
You see the Symbol dialog box (refer to Figure 2-6).

44
Finding and Replacing Text
 
2. If you’re looking to insert a symbol, not a foreign character, choose 
Webdings or Wingdings 1, 2, or 3 in the Font drop-down list.
 
 Webdings and the Wingdings fonts offer all kinds of weird and wacky 
symbols.
 
3. Select a symbol or foreign character.
 
 You may have to scroll to find the one you want.
 
4. Click the Insert button to enter the symbol and then click Close to 
close the dialog box.
 
 The Symbol dialog box lists the last several symbols or foreign charac-
ters you entered under Recently Used Symbols. See whether the symbol 
you need is listed there. It spares you the trouble of rummaging in the 
Symbol dialog box. In Word, Outlook, and Publisher, you see the last 
several symbols or foreign characters you entered on a drop-down list 
after you click the Symbol button.
Finding and Replacing Text
Use the Find command to locate a name or text passage. Use its twin, the power-
ful Replace command, to find and replace a name or text passage throughout a 
file. For an idea of how useful the Replace command is, imagine that the com-
pany you work for just changed its name and the old company name is in many 
different places. By using the Replace command, you can replace the old com-
pany name with the new name throughout a long file in a matter of seconds.
The basics: Finding stray words and phrases
To locate stray words, names, text passages, and formats, follow these basic 
steps:
 
 1. Press Ctrl+F or go to the Home tab and click the Find button. (In 
Excel, click the Find & Select button and choose Find on the drop-
down list.)
 
 A dialog box or pane appears so that you can enter search criteria. 
Figure 2-7 shows the Find dialog box in PowerPoint and the Find and 
Replace dialog box in Excel.

2. Enter the word or phrase in the Find What or Search Document 
text box.
 
 After you enter the word or phrase in Word, the Navigation pane lists 
each instance of the term you’re looking for and the term is highlighted 
in your document wherever it is found, as shown in Figure 2-8. You can 
click an instance of the search term in the Navigation pane to scroll to a 
location in your document where the search term is located.
 
 In Excel, PowerPoint, and Publisher, the Find What drop-down list shows 
words and phrases you looked for recently. You can make a selection 
from that list rather than enter a search term.

 Later in this chapter, “Narrowing your search” explains how to make 
searches more efficient.
 
4. Click the Find Next button if you’re looking for a simple word or 
phrase, or the Find All button to locate all instances of a word or 
phrase in your file.
 
 In PowerPoint, the Find All button is available only if you start your 
search in Slide Sorter view.
 
5. To find the next instance of the thing you’re looking for, click Find 
Next again.
 
 In Word, either click an instance of the search word in the Navigation 
pane or click the Previous Find/Go To or Next Find/Go To button at the 
bottom of the scroll bar (or press Ctrl+Page Up or Ctrl+Page Down) to go 
to the previous or next instance of the thing you’re looking for.
Narrowing your search
All the Office programs offer techniques for narrowing a search and making 
it more efficient. You can choose criteria for narrowing your search as well 
as search for text that has been formatted a certain way.
To narrow your search in Word, click the Find Options button, choose 
Options or Find on the drop-down list, and make choices in the Find Options 
or Find and Replace dialog box (refer to Figure 2-8). In Excel, click the 
Options button in the Find and Replace dialog box (refer to Figure 2-7).
Match Case and Find Whole Words Only
These options are your first line of defense in narrowing a search:
 
✦ Match Case: Searches for words with upper- and lowercase letters that 
exactly match those in the Find What or Search Document text box. 
When the Match Case option is selected, a search for bow finds bow, but 
not Bow or BOW.
 
✦ Find Whole Words Only (not available in Excel): Normally, a search for 
bow yields elbow, bowler, bow-wow, and all other words with the letters 
b-o-w (in that order). Click this option and you get only bow.
Searching for formats in Word and Excel
In Word and Excel, you can search for formats or text that was formatted a 
certain way with these techniques:
 
✦ In Word: Click the Format button in the Find and Replace dialog box 
(refer to Figure 2-8), and on the drop-down list, choose a Format type — 
Font, Paragraph, Tabs, Language, Frame, Style, or Highlight. A Find dialog 
box opens so that you can describe the format you’re looking for. Select 
options in the dialog box to describe the format and click OK.

Finding and Replacing Text
 
✦ In Excel: Click the Format button and choose a format in the Find Format 
dialog box. You can also open the drop-down list on the Format button, 
select Choose Format from Cell on the drop-down list, and click a cell to 
describe the format you’re looking for.
 
After you finish conducting your search for formatted text, don’t forget to 
click the No Formatting button (in Word) or open the Format drop-down list 
and choose Clear Find Format (in Excel). You can’t conduct a normal search 
again unless you turn format searching off.
Taking advantage of search criteria in Word
Above and beyond the other Office programs, Word offers a bunch of ways 
to narrow a search. To take advantage of the search options in Word, click 
the Find Options button (it’s located to the right of the Search Document 
box in the Navigation pane) and choose Options or Advanced Find on the 
drop-down list:
 
✦ Choose Options to open the Find Options dialog box and describe 
search criteria. With this technique, search terms when they are found 
are highlighted in the Navigation pane (provided that you select the 
Highlight All check box).
 
✦ Choose Advanced Find to open the Find tab of the Find and Replace 
dialog box and describe search criteria. With this technique, you click 
the Find Next button in the dialog box and locate search terms one at a 
time.
Word search options
Word offers these check box options for narrowing a search. 
 
✦ Use Wildcards: Click here if you intend to use wildcards in searches. 
(See “Using wildcard operators to refine searches,” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Sounds Like: Looks for words that sound like the one in the Find What 
box. A search for bow with this option selected finds beau, for example. 
However, it doesn’t find bough. This command isn’t very reliable.
 
✦ Find All Word Forms: Takes into account verb conjugations and plurals. 
With this option clicked, you get bows, bowing, and bowed as well as bow.
 
✦ Match Prefix: A prefix is a syllable appearing before the root or stem of a 
word to alter its meaning. For example, co, mid, non, and un are prefixes 
in the words coauthor, midtown, nonviolent, and unselfish. Choose this 
option and enter a prefix in the Find What text box to locate words that 
begin with the prefix you enter.
 
✦ Match Suffix: A suffix is a syllable or two appearing at the end of a word that 
alters its meaning. For example, age, ish, and ness are suffixes in the words 
spillage, smallish, and darkness. Choose this option and enter a suffix in the 
Find What text box to find words that end with the same suffix.

48
Finding and Replacing Text
 
✦ Ignore Punctuation Characters: Search in text for word phrases without 
regard for commas, periods, and other punctuation marks. For example, a 
search for Yuma Arizona finds Yuma, Arizona (with a comma) in the text.
 
✦ Ignore White-Space Characters: Search in text for word phrases without 
regard for white space caused by multiple blank spaces or tab entries.
Using wildcard operators to refine searches
Word permits you to use wildcard operators in searches. A wildcard operator 
is a character that represents characters in a search expression. Wildcards 
aren’t for everybody. Using them requires a certain amount of expertise, but 
after you know how to use them, wildcards can be invaluable in searches 
and macros. Table 2-2 explains the wildcard operators you can use in 
searches. Click the Use Wildcards check box if you want to search using 
wildcards.

You can’t conduct a whole-word-only search with a wildcard. For example, 
a search for f*s not only finds fads and fits but also all text strings that begin 
with f and end with s, such as for the birds. Wildcard searches can yield 
many, many results and are sometimes useless.
 
To search for an asterisk (*), question mark (?), or other character that serves 
as a wildcard search operator, place a backslash (\) before it in the text box.
Searching for special characters in Word
Table 2-3 describes the special characters you can look for in Word docu-
ments. To look for the special characters listed in the table, enter the charac-
ter directly in the text box or click the Special button in the Find and Replace 
dialog box, and then choose a special character from the pop-up list. Be sure 
to enter lowercase letters. For example, you must enter ^n, not ^N, to look for 
a column break. Note: A caret (^) precedes special characters.

2For use in replace operations only
Before searching for special characters in Word, go to the Home tab and 
click the Show/Hide¶ button. That way, you see special characters — also 
known as hidden format symbols — on-screen when Word finds them.
 
Creative people find many uses for special characters in searches. The 
easiest way to find section breaks, column breaks, and manual line breaks 
in a document is to enter ^b, ^n, or ^l, respectively, and start searching. 
By combining special characters with text, you can make find-and-replace 
operations more productive. For example, to replace all double hyphens (--) 
in a document with em dashes (—), enter -- in the Find What text box and ^m 
in the Replace With text box. This kind of find-and-replace operation is espe-
cially useful for cleaning documents that were created in another program 
and then imported into Word.
Conducting a find-and-replace operation
Conducting a find-and-replace operation is the spitting image of conducting 
a find operation. Figure 2-9 shows (in PowerPoint) the Replace dialog box, 
the place where you declare what you want to find and what to replace it

with. Do the options and buttons in the dialog box look familiar? They do if 
you read the previous handful of pages about searching because the Replace 
options are the same as the Find options.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Using the 
powerful 
Replace 
command in 
PowerPoint.
 
 
The key to a successful find-and-replace operation is making sure that you 
find exactly what you want to find and replace. One way to make sure that 
you find the right text is to start by running a Find operation. If the program 
finds precisely the text you want, you’re in business. Click the Replace tab or 
Replace button in the Find dialog box and then enter the replacement text.
To locate and replace words, names, or text passages with the Find com-
mand, follow these steps:
 
 1. Press Ctrl+H or go to the Home tab and click the Replace button (in 
Excel, click the Find & Select button and choose Replace on the drop-
down list).
 
 The Replace (or Find and Replace) dialog box appears (refer to Figure 2-9).
 
2. Describe the text that needs replacing.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “The basics: Finding stray words and phrases” 
explains how to construct a search. Try to narrow your search so that 
you find only the text you are looking for.
 
3. Click the Find Next button.
 
 Did your program find what you’re looking for? If it didn’t, describe the 
search again.
 
4. Enter the replacement text in the Replace With text box.
 
 You can select replacement text from the drop-down list.
 
5. Either replace everything simultaneously or do it one at a time.
 
 Click one of these buttons:
 
• Click Replace All to make all replacements in an instant.
 
• Click Find Next and then either click Replace to make the replace-
ment or Find Next to bypass it.

52
Creating Hyperlinks
 
Click the Replace All button only if you are very, very confident that the 
thing your program found is the thing you want to replace.
Be sure to examine your file after you conduct a find-and-replace operation. 
You never know what the powerful Replace command will do. If the com-
mand makes a hash of your file, click the Undo button.
Creating Hyperlinks
A hyperlink is an electronic shortcut from one place to another. If you’ve 
spent any time on the Internet, you know what a hyperlink is. Clicking hyper-
links on the Internet takes you to different Web pages or different places on 
the same Web page. In the Office programs, you can use hyperlinks to con-
nect readers to your favorite Web pages or to a different page, slide, or file. 
You can fashion a link out of a word or phrase as well as any object — a clip-
art image, text box, shape, or picture.
These pages explain how to insert a hyperlink to another place in your file as 
well as create links to Web pages. You also discover how to enter an e-mail 
hyperlink that makes it easy for others to e-mail you. By the way, the Office 
programs create a hyperlink for you automatically when you type a word 
that begins with www and ends with .com or .net. The programs create an 
automatic e-mail hyperlink when you enter letters that include the symbol 
(@) and end in .com or .net.
Linking a hyperlink to a Web page
It could well be that a Web page on the Internet has all the information your 
readers need. In that case, you can link to the Web page so that viewers can 
visit it in the course of viewing your file. When a viewer clicks the link, a Web 
browser opens and the Web page appears.
Follow these steps to hyperlink your file to a Web page on the Internet:
 
1. Select the text or object that will form the hyperlink.
 
 For example, select a line of text or phrase if you want viewers to be able 
to click it to go to a Web page.
 
 2. On the Insert tab, click the Hyperlink button (or press Ctrl+K).
 
 
 Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Links 
button before you can get to the Hyperlink button. You see the Insert 
Hyperlink dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-10. You can also open this 
dialog box by right-clicking an object or text and choosing Hyperlink on 
the shortcut menu.

• Click Browsed Pages: The dialog box lists Web pages you recently 
visited after you click this button, as shown in Figure 2-10. Choose a 
Web page.
 
• Type (or copy) a Web page address into the Address text box: Enter the 
address of the Web page. You can right-click the text box and choose 
Paste to copy a Web page address into the text box.
 
5. Click the ScreenTip button, enter a ScreenTip in the Set Hyperlink 
ScreenTip dialog box, and click OK.
 
 Viewers can read the ScreenTip you enter when they move their pointers 
over the hyperlink.
 
6. Click OK in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
 
 I would test the hyperlink if I were you to make sure that it takes viewers 
to the right Web page. To test a hyperlink, Ctrl+click it or right-click it 
and choose Open Hyperlink on the shortcut menu.

Creating an e-mail hyperlink
An e-mail hyperlink is one that opens an e-mail program. These links are 
sometimes found on Web pages so that anyone visiting a Web page can con-
veniently send an e-mail message to the person who manages the Web page. 
When you click an e-mail hyperlink, your default e-mail program opens. And 
if the person who set up the link was thorough about it, the e-mail message 
is already addressed and given a subject line.
 
Include an e-mail hyperlink in a file if you’re distributing the file to others 
and you would like them to be able to comment on your work and send the 
comments to you.
Follow these steps to put an e-mail hyperlink in a file:
 
1. Select the words or object that will constitute the link.
 
 2. On the Insert tab, click the Hyperlink button (or press Ctrl+K).
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
 
3. Under Link To, click E-Mail Address.
 
 Text boxes appear for entering an e-mail address and a subject message.
 
4. Enter your e-mail address and a subject for the messages that others 
will send you.
 
 Office inserts the word mailto: before your e-mail address as you enter it.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Test the link by Ctrl+clicking it. Your default e-mail program opens. The 
e-mail message is already addressed and given a subject.

Repairing and removing hyperlinks
From time to time, check the hyperlinks in your file to make sure that they 
still work. Clicking a hyperlink and having nothing happen is disappointing. 
Hyperlinks get broken when Web pages and parts of files are deleted.
To repair or remove a hyperlink, right-click the link and choose Edit 
Hyperlink on the shortcut menu (or click in the link and then click the 
Hyperlink button on the Insert tab). You see the Edit Hyperlink dialog box. 
This dialog box looks and works just like the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
 
✦ Repairing a link: Select a target in your file or a Web page and click OK.
 
✦ Removing a link: Click the Remove Link button. You can also remove a 
hyperlink by right-clicking the link and choosing Remove Hyperlink on 
the shortcut menu.

✓ Entering hard-to-type text with the AutoCorrect command
T
his brief chapter takes you on a whirlwind tour of shortcut commands 
that can save you time and effort no matter which Office program 
you’re working in. This chapter is devoted to people who want to get it done 
quickly and get away from their computers. It explains the Undo and Repeat 
commands, zooming in and out, and opening more than one window on the 
same file. You also discover how to display windows in different ways, cor-
rect your typos automatically, and enter hard-to-type terminology with a 
simple flick of the wrist.
Undoing and Repeating Commands
If I were to choose two commands for the Hall of Fame, they would be 
the Undo command and the Repeat command. One allows you to reverse 
actions you regret doing, and the other repeats a previous action without 
you having to choose the same commands all over again. Undo and Repeat 
are explained forthwith.
Undoing a mistake
Fortunately for you, all is not lost if you make a big blunder because Office 
has a marvelous little tool called the Undo command. This command 
“remembers” your previous editorial and formatting changes. As long as 
you catch your error in time, you can undo your mistake.
 
 Click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar (or press Ctrl+Z) to undo 
your most recent change. If you made your error and went on to do some-
thing else before you caught it, open the drop-down list on the Undo button. 

58
Undoing and Repeating Commands
It lists your previous actions, as shown in Figure 3-1. Click the action you 
want to undo, or if it isn’t on the list, scroll until you find the error and then 
click it.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Fixing a 
mistake with 
the Undo 
drop-down 
list.
 
 
Remember, however, that choosing an action far down the Undo list also 
reverses the actions before it on the list. For example, if you undo the 19th 
action on the list, you also undo the 18 more recent actions above it.
Repeating an action — and quicker this time
 
 The Quick Access toolbar offers a button called Repeat that you can click to 
repeat your last action. This button can be a mighty, mighty timesaver. For 
example, if you just changed fonts in one heading and you want to change 
another heading in the same way, select the heading and click the Repeat 
button (or press F4 or Ctrl+Y). Move the pointer over the Repeat button to 
see what clicking it does.
You can find many creative uses for the Repeat command if you use your 
imagination. For example, If you had to type “I will not talk in class” a hun-
dred times as a punishment for talking in class, you could make excellent 
use of the Repeat command to fulfill your punishment. All you would have to 
do is write the sentence once and then click the Repeat button 99 times.
After you click the Undo button, the Repeat button changes names and 
becomes the Redo button. Click the Redo button to “redo” the command you 
“undid.” In other words, if you regret clicking the Undo button, you can turn 
back the clock by clicking Redo.

Viewing a File through More Than One Window
 
Each Office program offers its own special Zoom commands in the Zoom 
group on the View tab. In Word, for example, you can display one page or 
many pages; in Excel, you can click the Zoom to Selection button and enlarge 
a handful of cells. Make friends with the Zoom commands. They never let 
you down.
Viewing a File through More Than One Window
By way of the commands in the Window group in the View tab, you can be 
two places simultaneously, at least where Office is concerned. You can work 
on two files at once. You can place files side by side on the screen and do a 
number of other things to make your work a little easier.
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint offer these buttons in the Window group:
 
 
✦ New Window: Opens another window on your file so you can be two 
places at once in the same file. To go back and forth between windows, 
click a taskbar button or click the Switch Windows button and choose a 
window name on the drop-down list. Click a window’s Close button 
when you’re finished looking at it.
 
 
✦ Arrange All: Arranges open windows side by side on-screen.
 
 
✦ Switch Windows: Opens a drop-down list with open windows so you can 
travel between windows.
You can also take advantage of these Window buttons in Word and Excel to 
compare files:
 
 
✦ View Side by Side: Displays files side by side so you can compare and 
contrast them.
 
 
✦ Synchronous Scrolling: Permits you to scroll two files at the same rate so 
you can proofread one against the other. To use this command, start by 
clicking the View Side by Side button. After you click the Synchronous 
Scrolling button, click the Reset Window Position button so both files 
are displayed at the same size on-screen.
 
 
✦ Reset Window Position: Makes files being shown side by side the same 
size on-screen to make them easier to compare.

perminent with an i instead of an a — the invisible hand of Office corrects 
the misspelling, and you get permanent. While you’re at it, type a colon and 
a close parenthesis :) — you get a smiley face.
As good as the AutoCorrect feature is, you can make it even better. You can 
also add the typos and misspellings you often make to the list of words that 
are corrected automatically.
Opening the AutoCorrect dialog box
Office corrects common spelling errors and turns punctuation mark combi-
nations into symbols as part of its AutoCorrect feature. To see which typos 
are corrected and which punctuation marks are turned into symbols, open 
the AutoCorrect dialog box by following these steps:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Options.
 
 
 You see the Options dialog box.
 
2. Go to the Proofing category.
 
3. Click the AutoCorrect Options button.
 
 The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
 
4. Click the AutoCorrect tab.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-3, the AutoCorrect tab lists words that are cor-
rected automatically. Scroll down the Replace list and have a look 
around. Go ahead. Make yourself at home.

Telling Office which typos and 
misspellings to correct
No doubt you make the same typing errors and spelling errors time and time 
again. To keep from making these errors, you can tell Office to correct them 
for you automatically. You do that by entering the misspelling and its cor-
rected spelling in the AutoCorrect dialog box (see Figure 3-3):
 
✦ Enter the misspelling in the Replace text box and its correct spelling in 
the With text box.
 
✦ Click the AutoCorrect button in the Spelling dialog box when you spell-
check a file. This action automatically places the misspelling and its cor-
rection in the AutoCorrect dialog box so that the correction is made in 
the future.
 
You can also remove misspellings and typos from the list of words that are 
corrected automatically. To remove a word from the list of corrected words, 
select it in the AutoCorrect dialog box and click the Delete button.
Preventing capitalization errors with AutoCorrect
Near the top of the AutoCorrect dialog box (refer to Figure 3-3) are five 
check boxes whose job is to prevent capitalization errors. These options do 
their jobs very well, sometimes to a fault:
 
✦ Correct TWo INitial Capitals: Prevents two capital letters from appear-
ing in a row at the start of a word with more than two letters. Only the 
first letter is capitalized. This option is for people who can’t lift their 
little fingers from the Shift key fast enough after typing the first capital 
letter at the start of a word.
 
✦ Capitalize first letter of sentences: Makes sure that the first letter in a 
sentence is capitalized.
 
✦ Capitalize first letter of table cells: Makes sure that the first letter you 
enter in a table cell is a capital letter. A table cell holds one data item; 
it’s the place in a table where a column and row intersect.
 
✦ Capitalize names of days: Makes sure that the names of the days of the 
week are capitalized.
 
✦ Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key: Changes capital letters to 
lowercase letters if you press the Shift key to start a sentence while Caps 
Lock is on. The idea here is that if you press down the Shift key while 
Caps Lock is on, you don’t know that Caps Lock is on because you don’t 
need to hold down the Shift key to enter capital letters. AutoCorrect 
turns the first letter into a capital letter and the following letters into 
lowercase letters and then turns Caps Lock off.

What’s entered when you type the text
In the Replace column in the AutoCorrect tab are hundreds of common 
typing errors and codes that Office corrects automatically. The program cor-
rects the errors by entering text in the With column whenever you mistak-
enly type the letters in the Replace column. However, you can also use this 
dialog box for a secondary purpose to quickly enter text.
To make AutoCorrect work as a means of entering text, you tell Office to 
enter the text whenever you type three or four specific characters. In Figure 
3-4, for example, Office is instructed to insert the words Cordyceps sinensis (a 
mushroom genus) whenever I enter the characters /cs (and press the space-
bar). Follow these steps to use AutoCorrect to enter text:

Entering Text Quickly with the AutoCorrect Command
 
1. Open the AutoCorrect tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box (see Figure 3-4).
 
2. In the Replace text box, enter the three or four characters that will 
trigger the AutoCorrect mechanism and make it enter your text.
 
 Don’t enter a word, or characters that you might really type someday, 
in the Replace box. If you do, the AutoCorrect mechanism might kick 
in when you least expect it. Enter three or four characters that never 
appear together. And start all AutoCorrect entries with a slash (/). You 
might forget which characters trigger the AutoText entry or decide 
to delete your AutoCorrect entry someday. By starting it with a slash, 
you can find it easily in the AutoCorrect dialog box at the top of the 
Replace list.
 
3. In the With text box, enter the hard-to-type name or word(s) that will 
appear when you enter the Replace text.
 
4. Click the Add button.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Test your AutoCorrect entry by typing the Replace text you entered in 
Step 2 (which, of course, includes the slash I recommend) and press-
ing the spacebar. (AutoCorrect doesn’t do its work until you press the 
spacebar.)
To delete an AutoCorrect entry, open the AutoCorrect dialog box, select the 
entry, and click the Delete button.

The Office proofing tools are not foolproof, but they’re close to it.
Correcting Your Spelling Errors
Office keeps a dictionary in its hip pocket, which is a good thing for you. 
Who wants to be embarrassed by a spelling error? Office consults its dic-
tionary when you enter text in Word, PowerPoint, Access, Excel, Outlook, 
and Publisher. To correct misspellings, you can either address them one at 
a time or start the spell checker and proof many pages or slides simultane-
ously. You can even create your own dictionary with the jargon and slang 
peculiar to your way of life and have Office check the spelling of your jargon 
and slang.
 
Don’t trust the smell checker to be accurate all the time. It doesn’t really 
locate misspelled words — it locates words that aren’t in its dictionary. For 
example, if you write “Nero diddled while Rome burned,” the spell checker 
won’t catch the error. Nero fiddled while Rome burned, but because diddle is 
a legitimate word in the spelling dictionary, the spell checker overlooks the 
error. The moral: Proofread your files carefully and don’t rely on the spell 
checker to catch all your smelling errors.

Correcting Your Spelling Errors
Correcting misspellings one at a time
In Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook, you can practice the one-at-
a-time method of spell-checking. As shown in Figure 4-1, you can right-click 
each word that is underlined in red and choose a correct spelling from the 
shortcut menu. After you choose a word from the shortcut menu, it replaces 
the misspelling that you right-clicked.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Right-click 
a word 
underlined 
in red to 
correct 
a typo or 
repeated 
word.
 
Words entered twice are also flagged in red, in which case the shortcut 
menu offers the Delete Repeated Word option so that you can delete the 
second word. You can also click Ignore All to tell Office when a word is cor-
rectly spelled and shouldn’t be flagged, or click Add to Dictionary, which 
adds the word to the Office spelling dictionary and declares it a correctly 
spelled word.
Running a spell-check
Instead of correcting misspellings one at a time, you run a spell-check on 
your work. Start your spell-check with one of these methods:
More than a few people think that the squiggly 
red lines that appear under misspelled words 
are annoying. To keep those lines from appear-
ing, press F7 to open the Spelling dialog box and 
click the Options button. You see the Proofing 
category of the Options dialog box. Deselect 
the Check Spelling As You Type check box.
Even with the red lines gone, you can do a 
quick spell-check of a word that you suspect 
has been misspelled. To do so, select the word 
(double-click it) and press F7. The Spelling 
dialog box appears if the word has indeed been 
misspelled. Select a word in the Suggestions 
box and click the Change button.

✦ Go to the Review tab and click the Spelling (or Spelling & Grammar) 
button (you may have to click the Proofing button to get to the Spelling 
button). In Access, you can find the spelling button on the Home tab.
You see the Spelling and Grammar (or Spelling) dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-2. Misspellings appear in the Not In Dictionary text box. As I explain 
shortly, your Office program offers all sorts of amenities for handling mis-
spellings, but here are options for correcting known misspellings in the 
Spelling dialog box:

dialog box.
 
Misspelled word
Choose the correct spelling and click Change
 
✦ Select the correct spelling in the Suggestions box and click the Change 
button.
 
✦ Click in the page or slide you’re working on and correct the spelling 
there; then click the Resume button, located where the Ignore or Ignore 
Once button used to be. (You can’t do this in Excel.)
 
✦ In Word, Excel, or Access, correct the spelling inside the Not in Dictionary 
text box and then click the Change button. (In PowerPoint, correct the 
spelling in the Change To box and then click the Change button.)
If the word in question isn’t a misspelling, tell your program how to handle 
the word by clicking one of these buttons:
 
✦ Ignore (or Ignore Once): Ignores this instance of the misspelling but 
stops on it again if the same misspelling appears later.
 
✦ Ignore All: Ignores the misspelling throughout the file you’re working on 
and in all other open Office files as well.
 
✦ Change/Delete: Enters the selected word in the Suggestions box in the 
file where the misspelling used to be. When the same word appears 

68
twice in a row, the Delete button appears where the Change button was. 
Click the Delete button to delete the second word in the pair.
 
✦ Change All/Delete All: Replaces all instances of the misspelled word 
with the word that you selected in the Suggestions box. Click the 
Change All button to correct a misspelling that occurs throughout 
a file. When two words appear in a row, this button is called Delete 
All. Click the Delete All button to delete the second word in the pair 
throughout your file.
 
✦ Add (or Add to Dictionary): Adds the misspelling to the Office spelling 
dictionary. By clicking the Add button, you tell Office that the misspell-
ing is a legitimate word or name.
 
✦ Suggest (in PowerPoint only): Changes the list of words in the Suggestions 
box. Select a word in the Suggestions box and then click the Suggest 
button to see whether you can find a correct spelling.
 
✦ AutoCorrect: Adds the spelling correction to the list of words that are 
corrected automatically. If you find yourself making the same typing 
error over and over, place the error on the AutoCorrect list and never 
have to correct it again. (See Chapter 3 of this mini-book for details.)
 
Office programs share the same spelling dictionary. For example, words you 
add to the spelling dictionary in PowerPoint are deemed correct spellings in 
Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Publisher publications, Access data-
bases, and Outlook e-mails.
Fine-tuning the spell checker
Especially if you deal in jargon and scientific terminology, you owe it to your-
self to fine-tune the spell checker. No matter how arcane, it can make sure 
that your jargon gets used correctly. These pages explain the nuances of the 
spell checker.
Employing other dictionaries to help with spell-checking
To find spelling errors, Office compares each word on your page or slide to 
the words in its main dictionary and a second dictionary called Custom.
dic. If a word you type isn’t found in either dictionary, Office considers the 
word a misspelling. The main dictionary lists all known words in the English 
language; the Custom.dic dictionary lists words, proper names, and techni-
cal jargon that you deemed legitimate when you clicked the Add (or Add to 
Dictionary) button in the course of a spell-check and added a word to the 
Custom.dic dictionary.
From Office’s standpoint, a dictionary is merely a list of words, one word per 
line, that has been saved in a .dic (dictionary) file. Besides the Custom.
dic dictionary, you can employ other dictionaries to help with spell-checking. 
People who work in specialized professions such as law or medicine can

69
also use legal dictionaries and medical dictionaries to spell-check their 
work. You can create dictionaries of your own for slang words, colloquial-
isms, or special projects. Before you start spell-checking, you can tell Office 
which dictionaries to use. You can edit dictionaries as well. All this magic is 
done by way of the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, shown in Figure 4-3, and 
explained in the pages that follow.

Click to edit or delete the words in a dictionary
Opening the Custom Dictionaries dialog box
Starting in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, you can create a new spelling 
dictionary, tell PowerPoint to use a third-party dictionary you acquired, edit 
words in a dictionary, and tell PowerPoint which dictionary to use in a spell-
check. Better keep reading.
Follow these steps to open the Custom Dictionaries dialog box:
 
 1. Press F7 or go to the Review tab and click the Spelling button.
 
 You see the Spelling and Grammar (or Spelling) dialog box.
 
2. Click the Options button.
 
 The Proofing category of the Options dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the Custom Dictionaries button.
Creating a new spelling dictionary
People who work in law offices, research facilities, and medical facilities 
type hundreds of arcane terms each day, none of which are in the main dic-
tionary. One way to make sure that arcane terms are spelled correctly is to 
create or acquire a dictionary of legal, scientific, or medical terms and use 
it for spell-checking purposes. By Office’s definition, a dictionary is simply a 
list of words saved in a dictionary (.dic) file.
Follow these steps to create a new spelling dictionary or tell Office that you 
want to use a secondary dictionary to check the spelling of words:
Correcting Your Spelling Errors

1. Click the New button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box (refer to 
Figure 4-3).
 
 You see the Create Custom Dictionary dialog box.
 
2. Enter a name for your new dictionary.
 
3. Click the Save button.
 
 See “Entering and editing words in a dictionary,” later in this chapter, to 
find out how to enter terms in your new spelling dictionary.
Using a third-party dictionary
Besides creating your own dictionary, you can acquire one and tell Office to 
use it by following these steps:
 
1. Take note of where the dictionary file is located on your computer.
 
 It doesn’t have to be in the C:\Users\User Name\AppData\
Roaming\Microsoft\UProof (Windows 7 and Windows Vista) or the 
C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data\
Microsoft\Proof (or UProof) (Windows XP) folder along with the 
other dictionaries for PowerPoint to use it.
 
2. Click the Add button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box (refer to 
Figure 4-3).
 
 The Add Custom Dictionary dialog box appears.
 
3. Locate and select the dictionary on your computer.
 
4. Click Open.
 
 The dictionary’s name appears in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box. 
Ten dictionaries total can appear in the Dictionary List box.
Select a dictionary and click the Remove button to remove its name from the 
Dictionary List box. Removing a name in no way, shape, or form deletes the 
dictionary.
Entering and editing words in a dictionary
To edit the words in the Custom.dic dictionary or any other dictionary, 
select its name in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box (refer to Figure 4-3) 
and click the Edit Word List button. A dialog box opens with a list of the 
words in the dictionary, as shown in Figure 4-4. From there, you can delete 
words (by clicking the Delete button) and add words to the dictionary (by 
clicking the Add button).

Preventing text from being spell-checked
Spell-checking address lists, lines of computer code, and foreign languages 
such as Spanglish for which Microsoft doesn’t offer foreign language diction-
aries is a thorough waste of time. Follow these steps in Word, PowerPoint, 
and Outlook to tell the spell checker to ignore text:
 
1. Select the text.
 
 2. In the Review tab, click the Language button and choose Set Proofing 
Language on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Language dialog box.
 
3. Select the Do Not Check Spelling or Grammar check box.
 
4. Click OK.
Checking for Grammatical Errors in Word
Much of what constitutes good grammar is, like beauty, in the eye of the 
beholder. Still, you can do your best to repair grammatical errors in Word 
documents by getting the assistance of the grammar checker. The grammar 
checker identifies grammatical errors, explains what the errors are, and 
gives you the opportunity to correct the errors.
 
 Figure 4-5 shows the grammar checker in action in the Spelling and Grammar 
dialog box. As long as the Check Grammar check box is selected, Word looks 
for grammatical errors along with spelling errors. To open the Spelling and 
Grammar dialog box, press F7 or go to the Review tab and click the Spelling 
& Grammar button.
Checking for Grammatical Errors in Word

72
 
Figure 4-5: 
Fix

Sentences in which grammatical errors appear are underlined in blue in your 
document. Meanwhile, the grammatical errors themselves appear in bright 
blue in the box at the top of the Spelling and Grammar dialog box (along 
with spelling errors, which are red). When Word encounters an error, take 
one of these actions to correct it:
 
✦ Select a correction in the Suggestions box and click the Change button.
 
✦ Delete the grammatical error or rephrase the sentence in the top of the 
dialog box, enter a correction, and click the Change button.
 
✦ Click outside the Spelling and Grammar dialog box, correct the gram-
matical error in your document, and then click the Resume button (you 
find it where the Ignore Once button used to be).
Click one of the Ignore buttons to let what Word thinks is a grammatical 
error stand.
If you want to fine-tune how Word runs its grammar checker, click the 
Options button in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box. You land in the 
Proofing category of the Word Options dialog box. Under When Correcting 
Spelling and Grammar in Word, choose whether to underline grammatical 
errors in your documents, whether to check for grammatical as well as spell-
ing errors, and in the Writing Style drop-down list, how stringent you want 
the rules of grammar to be. Choose Grammar & Style, not Grammar Only, if 
you want Word to enforce style rules as well as the rules of grammar.
Researching a Topic Inside an Office Program
Thanks to the Research task pane, your desk needn’t be as crowded as 
before. The Research task pane offers dictionaries, foreign language dic-
tionaries, a thesaurus, language translators, and encyclopedias, as well as 
Internet searching, all available from inside the Office programs. As shown 
in Figure 4-6, the Research task pane can save you a trip to the library. Table 4-1

Your computer must be connected to the Internet to run some of the ser-
vices in the Research task pane. Bilingual dictionaries and thesauruses are 
installed as part of the Office software, but the research Web sites and the 
Encarta dictionaries and encyclopedia require an Internet connection.
In order to use some of the services offered by the Research task pane, 
you must pay a fee. These services are marked in search results with the 
Premium Content icon.
Using the Research task pane
The task pane offers menus and buttons for steering a search in different 
directions, but no matter what you want to research in the Research task 
pane, start your search the same way:
 
1. Either click in a word or select the words that you want to research.
 
 For example, if you want to translate a word, click it. Clicking a word or 
selecting words saves you the trouble of entering words in the Search 
For text box, but if no word in your file describes what you want to 
research, don’t worry about it. You can enter the subject of your search 
later.
 
 2. On the Review tab, click the Research button (you may have to click 
the Proofing button first).
 
 The Research task pane appears (refer to Figure 4-6). If you’ve 
researched since you started running your Office program, the options 
you chose for researching last time appear in the task pane.

3. Enter a research term in the Search For text box (if one isn’t there 
already).
 
 If you weren’t able to click a word or select words in Step 1, enter 
research terms now.
 
4. Open the Search For drop-down list and tell Office where to steer your 
search (refer to Table 4-1).
 
 Choose a reference book, research Web site, or business and financial 
Web site. To research in a category, choose a category name — All 
Reference Books, All Research Sites, or All Business and Financial Sites. 
Later in this chapter, “Choosing your research options” explains how to 
decide which researching options appear on the drop-down list.
 
5. Click the Start Searching button (or press Enter).
 
 The results of your search appear in the Research task pane.
If your search yields nothing worthwhile or nothing at all, scroll to the 
bottom of the task pane, click Can’t Find It?, and try the All Reference Books 
or All Research Sites link. The first link searches all reference books — the 
dictionaries, thesauruses, and translation services. The second searches 
research sites — Bing, Factiva iWorks, and HighBeam Research.
 
You can retrace a search by clicking the Previous Search button or Next 
Search button in the Research task pane. These buttons work like the Back 
and Forward buttons in a Web browser.
Choosing your research options
Which research options appear in the Search For drop-down list is up 
to you. Maybe you want to dispense with the for-a-fee services. Maybe 
you want to get stock quotes from a particular country. To decide which 
research options appear in the Research task pane, open the task pane and 
click the Research Options link (at the bottom of the task pane). You see 
the Research Options dialog box. Select the research services you want and 
click OK.
Finding the Right Word with the Thesaurus
If you can’t find the right word or if the word is on the tip of your tongue 
but you can’t quite remember it, you can always give the thesaurus a shot. 
To find synonyms for a word, start by right-clicking the word and choosing 
Synonyms on the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 4-7 (you can’t do this in 
Excel). With luck, the synonym you’re looking for appears on the submenu, 
and all you have to do is click to enter the synonym. Usually, however, find-
ing a good synonym is a journey, not a Sunday stroll.

76
 
Figure 4-7:

To search for a good synonym, click the word in question and open the the-
saurus on the Research task pane with one of these techniques:
 
✦ Press Shift+F7.
 
✦ Right-click the word and choose Synonyms➪Thesaurus. 
 
 
✦ Go to the Review tab and click the Thesaurus button. 
The Research task pane opens. It offers a list of synonyms and sometimes 
includes an antonym or two at the bottom. Now you’re getting somewhere:
 
✦ Choosing a synonym: Move the pointer over the synonym you want, 
open its drop-down list, and choose Insert.
 
✦ Finding a synonym for a synonym: If a synonym intrigues you, click it. 
The task pane displays a new list of synonyms.
 
✦ Searching for antonyms: If you can’t think of the right word, type its 
antonym in the Search For box and then look for an “antonym of an ant-
onym” in the Research task pane.
 
✦ Revisit a word list: Click the Back button as many times as necessary. If 
you go back too far, you can always click its companion Forward button.
If your search for a synonym comes up dry, scroll to and click a link at the 
bottom of the Research task pane. Clicking All Reference Books gives you 
the opportunity to look up a word in the reference books you installed in 
the task pane; clicking All Research Sites gives you a chance to search the 
Internet (see “Researching a Topic inside an Office Program” earlier in this 
chapter for details).

Proofing Text Written in a Foreign Language
In the interest of cosmopolitanism, Office gives you the opportunity to make 
foreign languages a part of Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, 
Publisher publications, and Outlook messages. To enter and edit text in a 
foreign language, start by installing proofing tools for the language. With the 
tools installed, you tell Office where in your file a foreign language is used. 
After that, you can spell-check text written in the language.
To spell-check text written in Uzbek, Estonian, Afrikaans, and other lan-
guages apart from English, French, and Spanish, you have to obtain addi-
tional proofing tools from Microsoft. These can be obtained at the Microsoft 
Product Information Center at www.microsoft.com/products (enter 
proofing tools in the Search box). Proofing tools include a spell checker, 
grammar checker, thesaurus, hyphenator, AutoCorrect list, and translation 
dictionary, but not all these tools are available for every language.
 
In PowerPoint and Word, the status bar along the bottom of the window lists 
which language the cursor is in. Glance at the status bar if you aren’t sure 
which language Office is whispering in your ear.
Telling Office which languages you will use
Follow these steps to inform Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook that 
you will use a language or languages besides English in your files:
 
 1. On the Review tab, click the Language button and choose Language 
Preferences.
 
 
 The Options dialog box opens to the Language category.
 
2. Open the Add Additional Editing Languages drop-down list, select a 
language, and click the Add button to make that language a part of 
your presentations, documents, and messages.
 
3. Click OK.
Marking text as foreign language text
The next step is to tell Office where in your file you’re using a foreign lan-
guage. After you mark the text as foreign language text, Office can spell-
check it with the proper dictionaries. Follow these steps to mark text so that 
Office knows in which language it was written:
 
1. Select the text that you wrote in a foreign language.
 
2. Go to the Review tab.
Proofing Text Written in a Foreign Language

Translating Foreign Language Text
Office offers a gizmo for translating words and phrases from one language to 
another. The translation gizmo gives you the opportunity to translate single 
words and phrases as well as entire files, although, in my experience, it is 
only good for translating words and phrases. To translate an entire file, you 
have to seek the help of a real, native speaker.
Follow these steps to translate foreign language text:
 
1. Select the word or phrase that needs translating.
 
 2. On the Review tab, click the Translate button and choose a Translate 
option on the drop-down list.
 
 
 Office offers these ways to translate words:
 
• Translate Document (Word only): Word sends the text to a translation 
service at Bing Translator, and the translated text appears on a Web 
page. Copy the text and do what you will with it. (If the wrong trans-
lation languages are listed, choose the correct languages from the 
drop-down lists.)

✓ Understanding table jargon
✓ Creating a table and entering the text and numbers
✓ Aligning table text in various ways
✓ Merging and splitting cells to make interesting layouts
✓ Changing the size of rows and columns
✓ Decorating a table with table styles, colors, and borders
✓ Doing math calculations in a Word table
✓ Discovering an assortment of table tricks
T
he best way to present a bunch of data at once in Word, PowerPoint, or 
Publisher is to do it in a table. Viewers can compare and contrast the 
data. They can compare Elvis sightings in different cities or income from 
different businesses. They can contrast the number of socks lost in different 
washing machine brands. A table is a great way to plead your case or defend 
your position. On a PowerPoint slide, the audience can see right away that 
the numbers back you up. In a Word or Publisher document, readers can 
refer to your table to get the information they need.
As everyone who has worked on tables knows, however, tables are a chore. 
Getting all the columns to fit, making columns and rows the right width 
and height, and editing the text in a table isn’t easy. This chapter explains 
how to create tables, enter text in tables, change the number and size of 
columns and rows, lay out tables, format tables, and (in Word) do the math 
in tables. You also discover a few tricks — including using a picture for the 
background — that only magicians know. And to start you on the right foot, 
I begin by explaining table jargon.

82
Talking Table Jargon
Talking Table Jargon
As with much else in Computerland, tables have their own jargon. Figure 5-1 
describes this jargon. Sorry, but you need to catch up on these terms to con-
struct the perfect table:
 
✦ Cell: The box that is formed where a row and column intersect. Each cell 
holds one data item.
 
✦ Header row: The name of the labels along the top row that explain what 
is in the columns below.
 
✦ Row labels: The labels in the first column that describe what is in 
each row.
 
✦ Borders: The lines in the table that define where the rows and 
columns are.
 
✦ Gridlines: The gray lines that show where the columns and rows are. 
Unless you’ve drawn borders around all the cells in a table, you can’t tell 
where rows and columns begin and end without gridlines. To display or 
hide the gridlines, go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab and click the View 
Gridlines button.

Creating a Table
Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher offer several ways to create a table:
 
 
✦ Drag on the Table menu. On the Insert tab, click the Table button, point 
in the drop-down list to the number of columns and rows you want, 
click, and let go of the mouse button.

Book I
Chapter 5
Creating a Table
83
Creating a Table
 
✦ Use the Insert Table dialog box. On the Insert tab, click the Table 
button and choose Insert Table on the drop-down list. The Insert Table 
dialog box appears. Enter the number of columns and rows you want 
and click OK. In PowerPoint, you can also open the Insert Table dialog 
box by clicking the Table icon in a content placeholder frame.
 
✦ Draw a table (Word and PowerPoint). On the Insert tab, click the Table 
button and then choose Draw Table on the drop-down list. The pointer 
changes into a pencil. Use the pencil to draw table borders, rows, and 
columns. If you make a mistake, click the Eraser button on the (Table 
Tools) Design tab and drag it over the parts of the table you regret draw-
ing (you may have to click the Draw Borders button first). When you 
finish drawing the table, press Esc.
 
 You can click the Pen Color button and choose a color on the drop-down 
list to draw your table in your favorite color.
 
✦ Create a quick table (Word). On the Insert tab, click the Table button 
and choose Quick Tables on the drop-down list. Then choose a ready-
made table on the submenu. You have to replace the sample data in the 
quick table with your own data.
 
✦ Convert text in a list into a table (Word). Press Tab or enter a comma 
in each list item where you want the columns in the table to be. For 
example, to turn an address list into a table, put each name and address 
on its own line and press Tab or enter a comma after the first name, the 
last name, the street address, the city, the state, and the ZIP Code. For 
this feature to work, each name and address — each line — must have 
the same number of tab spaces or commas in it. Select the text you’ll 
convert to a table, click the Table button on the Insert tab, and choose 
Convert Text to Table. Under Separate Text At in the Convert Text to 
Table dialog box, choose Tabs or Commas to tell Word how the columns 
are separated. Then click OK.
Fans of Microsoft Excel will be glad to know 
that you can construct an Excel worksheet in 
a Word document or PowerPoint slide. Excel 
worksheets, which present data in columns 
and rows, are very much like tables and can 
serve as such in documents and slides.
To create an Excel worksheet, go to the Insert 
tab, click the Table button, and choose Excel 
Spreadsheet. An Excel worksheet appears 
on the slide and — gadzooks! — you see 
Excel menus and commands where Word or 
PowerPoint menus and commands used to 
be. The worksheet you just created is embed-
ded in your file. Whenever you click the work-
sheet, Excel menus and commands rather than 
Word or PowerPoint menus and commands 
appear on-screen. Click outside the worksheet 
to return to Word or PowerPoint. Book VIII, 
Chapter 7 explains how embedded objects 
work.

After you create a table, you get two new tabs on the Ribbon. The (Table 
Tools) Design tab offers commands for changing the look of the table; the 
(Table Tools) Layout tab is for changing around the rows and columns.
Entering the Text and Numbers
After you create the table, you can start entering text and numbers. All you 
have to do is click in a cell and start typing. Select your table and take advan-
tage of these techniques to make the onerous task of entering table data a 
little easier:
 
✦ Quickly changing a table’s size: Drag the bottom or side of a table to 
change its overall size. In Word, you can also go to the (Table Tools) 
Layout tab, click the AutoFit button, and choose AutoFit Window to 
make the table stretch from margin to margin.
 
✦ Moving a table: In Word, switch to Print Layout view and drag the table 
selector (the square in the upper-left corner of the table). In PowerPoint 
and Publisher, move the pointer over the table’s perimeter, and when 
you see the four-headed arrow, click and drag.
 
✦ Choosing your preferred font and font size: Entering table data is 
easier when you’re working in a font and font size you like. Select the 
table, visit the Home tab, and choose a font and font size there. In Word 
and PowerPoint, you can select a table by going to the (Table Tools) 
Layout tab, clicking the Select button, and choosing Select Table on the 
drop-down list.
 
✦ Quickly inserting a new row: Click in the last column of the last row 
in your table and press the Tab key to quickly insert a new row at the 
bottom of the table.
Here are some shortcuts for moving the cursor in a table:

Selecting Different Parts of a Table
It almost goes without saying, but before you can reformat, alter, or diddle 
with table cells, rows, or columns, you have to select them:
 
✦ Selecting cells: To select a cell, click in it. You can select several adja-
cent cells by dragging the pointer over them.
 
 
✦ Selecting rows: Move the pointer to the left of the row and click when 
you see the right-pointing arrow; click and drag to select several rows. 
You can also go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click inside the row you 
want to select, click the Select button, and choose Select Row on the 
drop-down list. To select more than one row at a time, select cells in the 
rows before choosing the Select Row command.
 
✦ Selecting columns: Move the pointer above the column and click when 
you see the down-pointing arrow; click and drag to select several col-
umns. You can also start from the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click in the 
column you want to select, click the Select button, and choose Select 
Column in the drop-down list. To select several columns, select cells in 
the columns before choosing the Select Column command.
 
✦ Selecting a table: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the Select 
button, and choose Select Table on the drop-down list. In PowerPoint, 
you can also right-click a table and choose Select Table on the shortcut 
menu.
Aligning Text in Columns and Rows
Aligning text in columns and rows is a matter of choosing how you want the 
text to line up vertically and how you want it to line up horizontally. Select 
the cells, columns, or rows, with text that you want to align (or select your 
entire table) and then align the text:
 
✦ In Word and Publisher: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click an Align 
button (you may have to click the Alignment button first, depending 
on the size of your screen). Word offers nine of them in the Alignment 
group.
 
✦ In PowerPoint: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click one Horizontal 
Align button (Align Left, Center, or Align Right), and one Vertical Align 
button (Align Top, Center Vertically, or Align Bottom). You may have to 
click the Alignment button first.

Merging and Splitting Cells
Merge and split cells to make your tables a little more elegant than run-of-
the-mill tables. Merge cells to break down the barriers between cells and join 
them into one cell; split cells to divide a single cell into several cells (or sev-
eral cells into several more cells). In the table shown in Figure 5-2, the cells 
in rows two, four, and six have been merged and a baseball player’s name 
appears in each merged cell. Where rows two, four, and six originally had 
nine cells, they now have only one.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Merge cells 
to create 
larger cells.
 
Merge and split cells
Select the cells you want to merge or split, go to the (Table Tools) Layout 
tab, and follow these instructions to merge or split cells:
 
 
✦ Merging cells: Click the Merge Cells button (in Word and PowerPoint, 
you can also right-click and choose Merge Cells).
 
 
✦ Splitting cells: Click the Split Cells button (in Word and PowerPoint, you 
can also right-click and choose Split Cells). In the Split Cells dialog box, 
declare how many columns and rows you want to split the cell into and 
then click OK. In Publisher, you can only split cells that were previously 
merged.
In Word and PowerPoint, you can merge and split cells by clicking the Draw 
Table or Eraser button on the (Table Tools) Design tab. Click the Draw Table 
button and then draw lines through cells to split them. Click the Eraser 
button and drag over or click the boundary between cells to merge cells. 
Press Esc when you finish drawing or erasing table cell boundaries. You can

Split Table button.
Laying Out Your Table
Very likely, you created too many or too few columns or rows for your table. 
Some columns are probably too wide and others too narrow. If that’s the 
case, you have to change the table layout by deleting, inserting, and chang-
ing the size of columns and rows, not to mention changing the size of the 
table itself. In other words, you have to modify the table layout. (Later in this 
chapter, “Decorating your table with borders and colors” shows how to put 
borders around tables and embellish them in other ways.)
Changing the size of a table, columns, and rows
The fastest way to adjust the width of columns, the height of rows, and the 
size of a table itself is to ”eyeball it” and drag the mouse:
 
 
✦ Column or row: Move the pointer onto a gridline or border, and when 
the pointer changes into a double-headed arrow, start dragging. Tug and 
pull, tug and pull until the column or row is the right size.
 
 In Word and PowerPoint, you can also go to the (Table Tools) Layout 
tab and enter measurements in the Height and Width text boxes to 
change the width of a column or the height of a row. The measurements 
affect entire columns or rows, not individual cells.
 
✦ A table: Select your table and use one of these techniques to change its 
size in Word and PowerPoint:
 
• Dragging: Drag the top, bottom, or side of the table. You can also drag 
the lower-right corner to change the size vertically and horizontally.
 
• Height and Width text boxes: On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, enter 
measurements in the Height and Width text boxes. In Publisher, 
these text boxes are found on the (Table Tools) Design tab. In 
PowerPoint, click the Lock Aspect Ratio check box if you want to 
keep the table’s proportions when you change its height or width.
 
• Table Properties dialog box (Word only): On the (Table Tools) Layout 
tab, click the Cell Size group button, and on the Table tab of the 
Table Properties dialog box, enter a measurement in the Preferred 
Width text box.
Laying Out Your Table

88
Adjusting column and row size
Resizing columns and rows can be problematic in Word and PowerPoint. For 
that reason, Word and PowerPoint offer special commands on the (Table 
Tools) Layout tab for adjusting the width and height of rows and columns:
 
 
✦ Making all columns the same width: Click the Distribute Columns 
button to make all columns the same width. Select columns before 
giving this command to make only the columns you select the same 
width.
 
 
✦ Making all rows the same height: Click the Distribute Rows button to 
make all rows in the table the same height. Select rows before clicking 
the button to make only the rows you select the same height.
 
 In Word, you can also click the AutoFit button on the (Table Tools) Layout 
tab, and take advantage of these commands on the drop-down list for han-
dling columns and rows:
 
✦ AutoFit Contents: Make each column wide enough to accommodate its 
widest entry.
 
✦ AutoFit Window: Stretch the table so that it fits across the page 
between the left and right margin.
 
✦ Fixed Column Width: Fix the column widths at their current settings.
Inserting and deleting columns and rows
 
The trick to inserting and deleting columns and rows is to correctly select 
part of the table first. You can insert more than one column or row at a time 
by selecting more than one column or row before giving the Insert com-
mand. To insert two columns, for example, select two columns and choose 
an Insert command; to insert three rows, select three rows and choose an 
Insert command. Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting Different Parts of a Table” 
explains how to make table selections.
Go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab and follow these instructions to insert 
and delete columns and rows:
 
✦ Inserting columns: Select a column or columns and click the Insert Left 
or Insert Right button. If you want to insert just one column, click in a 
column and then click the Insert Left or Insert Right button. You can 
also right-click, choose Insert, and choose an Insert Columns command.
 
✦ Inserting rows: Select a row or rows and click the Insert Above or Insert 
Below button. If you want to insert just one row, click in a row and click 
the Insert Above or Insert Below button. You can also right-click, choose 
Insert, and choose an Insert Rows command on the shortcut menu.
Laying Out Your Table

Book I
Chapter 5
Creating a Table
89
 
 To insert a row at the end of a table, move the pointer into the last cell 
in the last row and press the Tab key.
 
 
✦ Deleting columns: Click in the column you want to delete, click the 
Delete button, and choose Delete Columns on the drop-down list. Select 
more than one column to delete more than one. (Pressing the Delete key 
deletes the data in the column, not the column itself.)
 
✦ Deleting rows: Click in the row you want to delete, click the Delete 
button, and choose Delete Rows. Select more than one row to delete 
more than one. (Pressing the Delete key deletes the data in the row, not 
the row itself.)
On the subject of moving columns and rows, 
the fastest way to rearrange the rows in a 
Word table is to sort the table. Sorting means 
to rearrange all the rows in a table on the basis 
of data in one or more columns. For example, 
a table that shows candidates and the number 
of votes they received could be sorted in alpha-
betical order by the candidates’ names or in 
numerical order by the number of votes they 
received. Both tables present the same infor-
mation, but the information is sorted in different 
ways.
The difference between ascending and 
descending sorts is as follows:
 ✓ Ascending arranges text from A to Z, num-
bers from smallest to largest, and dates 
from earliest to latest.
 ✓ Descending arranges text from Z to A, 
numbers from largest to smallest, and 
dates from latest to earliest.
When you rearrange a table by sorting it, Word 
rearranges the formatting as well as the data. 
Do your sorting before you format the table.
Follow these steps to sort a table:
 1. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the 
Sort button.
 
 You see the Sort dialog box. Depending on 
the size of your screen, you may have to 
click the Data button before you see the 
Sort button.
 2. In the first Sort By drop-down list, choose 
the column you want to sort with.
 3. If necessary, open the first Type drop-
down list and choose Text, Number, or 
Date to describe what kind of data you’re 
dealing with.
 4. Select the Ascending or Descending 
option button to declare whether you want 
an ascending or descending sort.
 5. If necessary, on the first Then By drop-
down list, choose the tiebreaker column.
 
 If two items in the Sort By columns are 
alike, Word looks to your Then By column 
choice to break the tie and place one row 
before another in the table. 
 6. Click OK.
When you sort a table, Word ignores the 
header row — the first row in the table — and 
doesn’t move it. However, if you want to include 
the header row in the sort, click the No Header 
Row option button in the Sort dialog box.

Moving columns and rows
Because there is no elegant way to move a column or row, you should move 
only one at a time. If you try to move several simultaneously, you open a can 
of worms that is best left unopened. To move a column or row:
 
1. Select the column or row you want to move.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting Different Parts of a Table” explains 
how to select columns and rows.
 
2. Right-click in the selection and choose Cut on the shortcut menu.
 
 The column or row is moved to the Clipboard.
 
3. Insert a new column or row where you want the column or row to be.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Inserting and deleting columns and rows” 
explains how.
 
4. Move the column or row:
 
• Column: Click in the topmost cell in your new column and then click 
the Paste button or press Ctrl+V.
 
• Row: Click in the first column of the row you inserted and then click 
the Paste button or press Ctrl+V.
Formatting Your Table
After you enter text in the table, lay out the columns and rows, and make 
them the right size, the fun begins. Now you can dress up your table and 
make it look snazzy. You can change fonts, choose colors for columns and 
rows, and even land a graphic in the background of your table. You can also 
play with the borders that divide the columns and rows and shade columns, 
rows, and cells by filling them with gray shades or a black background. Read 
on to find out how to do these tricks.
Designing a table with a table style
 
The fastest way to get a good-looking table is to select a table style in the 
Table Styles gallery, as shown in Figure 5-3. A table style is a ready-made 
assortment of colors and border choices. You can save yourself a lot of for-
matting trouble by selecting a table style. After you’ve selected a table style, 
you can modify it by selecting or deselecting check boxes in the Table Style 
Options group.

Modify your table
Select a table style
Click anywhere in your table and follow these steps to choose a table style:
 
1. Go to the (Table Tools) Design tab.
 
2. Open the Table Styles gallery and move the pointer over table style 
choices to “live-preview” the table.
 
 In Publisher, this gallery is called Table Formats.
 
3. Select a table style.
 
 To remove a table style, open the Table Styles gallery and choose Clear 
(in Word) or Clear Table (in PowerPoint).
 
For consistency’s sake, choose a similar table style — or better yet the same 
table style — for all the tables in your document or presentation. This way, 
your work doesn’t become a showcase for table styles.
Calling attention to different rows and columns
On the (Table Tools) Design tab, Word and PowerPoint offer Table Style 
Options check boxes for calling attention to different rows or columns (refer 
to Figure 5-3). For example, you can make the first row in the table, called 
the header row, stand out by selecting the Header Row check box. If your 
table presents numerical data with total figures in the last row, you can call 
Formatting Your Table

attention to the last row by selecting the Total Row check box. Select or 
deselect these check boxes on the (Table Tools) Design tab to make your 
table easier to read and understand:
 
✦ Header Row and Total Row: These check boxes make the first row and 
last row in a table stand out. Typically, the header row is a different 
color or contains boldface text because it is the row that identifies the 
data in the table. Click the Header Row check box to make the first row 
stand out; if you also want the last row to stand out, click the Total Row 
check box.
 
✦ Banded Columns and Banded Rows: Banded means “striped” in Office 
lingo. For striped columns or striped rows — columns or rows that alter-
nate in color — select the Banded Columns or Banded Rows check box.
 
✦ First Column and Last Column: Often the first column stands out in a 
table because it identifies what type of data is in each row. Select the 
First Column check box to make it a different color or boldface its text. 
Check the Last Column check box if you want the rightmost column to 
stand out.
Decorating your table with borders and colors
Rather than rely on a table style, you can play interior decorator on your 
own. You can slap color on the columns and rows of your table, draw bor-
ders around columns and rows, and choose a look for borders. Figure 5-4 
shows the drop-down lists on the (Table Tools) Design tab that pertain to 
table decoration. Use these lists to shade table columns and rows and draw 
table borders.

Designing borders for your table
Follow these steps to fashion a border for your table or a part of your table:
 
1. Go to the (Table Tools) Design tab.
 
2. Select the part of your table that needs a new border.
 
 To select the entire table, go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the 
Select button, and choose Select Table.
 
3. Open the Line Style drop-down list (in Word) or the Pen Style drop-
down list (in PowerPoint) and choose a line style for the border (you 
may have to click the Draw Borders button first, depending on the 
size of your screen).
 
 Stay away from the dotted and dashed lines unless you have a good 
reason for choosing one. These lines can be distracting and keep others 
from focusing on the data presented in the table.
 
4. Open the Line Weight drop-down list (in Word and Publisher) or the 
Pen Weight drop-down list (in PowerPoint) and choose a thickness for 
the border (you may have to click the Draw Borders button first).
 
 5. If you want your borders to be a color apart from black, click the Pen 
Color button (Word and PowerPoint) or the Line Color button 
(Publisher) and choose a color on the drop-down list (you may have to 
click the Draw Borders button first).
 
 6. Open the drop-down list on the Borders button and choose where to 
place borders on the part of the table you selected in Step 2.
 
 
 This is the tricky part. The Borders commands have different effects, 
depending on which part of the table you selected. For example, if you 
selected two rows and you choose the Top Border command, the com-
mand applies only to the top of the uppermost row. If you are anywhere 
near typical, you have to repeat Step 6 until you get it right.
In Word, you can also change borders by clicking the Draw Borders group 
button and making selections in the Borders and Shading dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 5-5.

Follow these steps to paint columns, rows, or your table a new color:
 
1. Select the part of the table that needs a paint job.
 
 2. In the (Table Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Shading button and choose a color (refer to Figure 5-5).
 
 
 This button is called Fill in Publisher.

to use a picture as the background in a table.
Using Math Formulas in Word Tables
No, you don’t have to add the figures in columns and rows yourself; Word 
gladly does that for you. Word can perform other mathematical calculations 
as well. Follow these steps to perform mathematical calculations and tell 
Word how to format sums and products:
 
1. Put the cursor in the cell that will hold the sum or product of the cells 
above, below, to the right, or to the left.
 
 2. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the Formula button.
 
 
 Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Data 
button first. The Formula dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6. In 
its wisdom, Word makes an educated guess about what you want the 
formula to do and places a formula in the Formula box.

3. If this isn’t the formula you want, delete everything except the equal 
sign in the Formula box, open the Paste Function drop-down list, and 
choose another function for the formula.
 
 For example, choose PRODUCT to multiply figures. You may have to 
type left, right, above, or below in the parentheses within the formula 
to tell Word where the figures that you want it to compute are.
 
4. In the Number Format drop-down list, choose a format for your 
number.
 
5. Click OK.
 
Word doesn’t calculate blank cells in formulas. Enter 0 in blank cells if 
you want them to be included in calculations. You can copy functions from 
one cell to another to save yourself the trouble of opening the Formula 
dialog box.
Neat Table Tricks
The rest of this chapter details a handful of neat table tricks to make your 
tables stand out in a crowd. Why should all tables look alike? Read on to 
discover how to make text in the header row stand on its ear, put a picture 
behind a table, draw diagonal border lines, draw on top of a table, and wrap 
slide text around a table.
Changing the direction of header row text
In a top-heavy table in which the cells in the first row contain text and the 
cells below contain numbers, consider changing the direction of the text in 
the first row to make the table easier to read. Changing text direction in the 
first row is also a good way to squeeze more columns onto a table. Consider 
how wide the table shown in Figure 5-7 would be if the words in the first row 
were displayed horizontally.

Figure 5-7:

Follow these steps to change the direction of text on a table.
 
1. Select the row that needs a change of text direction.
 
 Usually, that’s the first row in a table.
 
2. Go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab.
 
 3. Click the Text Direction button.
 
 
 What happens next depends on whether you’re operating in Word, 
Publisher, or PowerPoint:
 
• In Word and Publisher: Keep clicking the Text Direction button until 
text lands where you want it to land. (You may have to click the 
Alignment button before you can see the Text Direction button.)
 
• In PowerPoint: Choose a Text Direction option on the drop-down 
list. (You may have to click the Alignment button to get to the Text 
Direction button, depending on the size of your screen.)
 
4. Change the height of the row to make the vertical text fit.
 
 As “Changing the size of a table, columns, and rows” explains earlier in 
this chapter, you can change the height of a row by going to the (Table 
Tools) Layout tab and entering a measurement in the Height box.
Using a picture as the table background
As Figure 5-8 demonstrates, a picture used as the background in a table 
looks mighty nice. To make it work, however, you need a graphic that serves 
well as the background. For Figure 5-8, I got around this problem by recolor-
ing my graphic (Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to recolor a graphic.) You 
also need to think about font colors. Your audience must be able to read the 
table text, and that usually means choosing a white or light font color for 
text so that the text can be read over the graphic. For Figure 5-8, I selected a 
white font color.

cells (right).
 
Besides putting a graphic behind a table, PowerPoint gives you the oppor-
tunity to make the graphic appear in every table cell, as shown on the right 
side of Figure 5-8. Sorry, you can’t do that feat in Word, but you can place a 
picture behind a table, as the following pages explain.
Placing a picture behind a table
Placing a graphic behind a table requires a fair bit of work, but the results 
are well worth the effort. First you insert the graphic and perhaps recolor it. 
Then you create the table. Last, you make the table fit squarely on top of the 
graphic and perhaps group the objects together.
In Word and PowerPoint, follow these steps to place a graphic behind a 
table:
 
1. Insert the graphic, resize it, and format the graphic.
 
 Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to insert and resize graphics. To insert 
a graphic, go to the Insert tab and click the Picture button. To resize it, 
drag a selection handle; make the graphic as big as you want your table 
to be. To recolor a graphic similar to the job done to the graphic in 
Figure 5-8, select the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Color button, 
and choose an option.
 
2. Insert the table and make it roughly the same size as the graphic.
 
 These tasks are explained earlier in this chapter. To change the size 
of a table, drag a selection handle on its corner or side. Place the table 
nearby the graphic, but not right on top of it.
Neat Table Tricks

98
 
3. On the (Table Tools) Design tab, open the Table Styles gallery, and 
choose Clear (in Word) or Clear Table (in PowerPoint).
 
 With the table styles out of the way, you can see the graphic clearly 
through your table.
 
4. Enter the data in the table, select a font and font color, select a border 
and border color, and align the text.
 
 These tasks (except for selecting fonts) are described throughout this 
chapter. The easiest way to choose a font and font color for a table is to 
select the table, go to the Home tab, and select a font and font size.
 
5. Move the table squarely on top of the graphic and then make the table 
and graphic roughly the same size.
Here are a few tricks that are worth knowing when you’re handling a graphic 
and table:
 
✦ In Word, you have to turn off text wrapping in order to bring the graphic 
behind the table. To do that, select your graphic, go to the (Picture 
Tools) Format tab, click the Wrap Text button, and choose Behind Text 
on the drop-down list.
 
✦ If the graphic is in front of the table, select the graphic, go to the 
(Picture Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Send 
Backward button, and choose Send to Back (in PowerPoint) or Send 
Behind Text (in Word).
 
✦ To make the graphic and table the same size, enter the same measure-
ments for both. Select the table, go to the (Table Tools) Layout tab, and 
enter measurements for the table in the Height and Width boxes. Then 
select the graphic, go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab, and enter the 
same measurements in the Height and Width boxes (you may have to 
click the Size button to see these boxes, depending on the size of your 
screen).
Placing a background picture in each PowerPoint table cell
PowerPoint offers a special command for placing a picture in each table 
cell (refer to Figure 5-8). For this trick to work, you need a graphic of uni-
form color; otherwise, the text is too hard to read. (You might consult 
Book VIII, Chapter 3, which explains how to alter graphics with the Office

PowerPoint table cell:
 
1. Right-click your table and choose Select Table.
 
2. Go to the (Table Tools) Design tab.
 
  3. Open the drop-down list on the Shading button and choose Picture.

 To remove the background pictures from a table, open the drop-down 
list on the Shading button and choose No Fill or choose Clear Table in 
the Table Styles gallery.
Drawing diagonal lines on tables
Draw diagonal lines across table cells to cancel out those cells or otherwise 
make cells look different. In Figure 5-9, diagonal lines are drawn on cells to 
show that information that would otherwise be in the cells is either not avail-
able or is not relevant.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Diagonal 
lines mark 
off cells as 
different.
 
Go to the (Table Tools) Design tab and use one of these techniques to draw 
diagonal lines across cells:
 
 
✦ Draw Table button: Click the Draw Table button (you may have to click 
the Draw Borders button first). The pointer changes into a pencil. Drag 
to draw the diagonal lines. Press Esc or click the Draw Table button a 
second time when you’re finished drawing.
 
 Click the Pen Color button and choose a color before drawing on your 
table if you want the diagonal lines to be a certain color.
 
 
✦ Borders button: Select the cells that need diagonal lines, open the drop-
down list on the Borders button, and choose Diagonal Down Border or 
Diagonal Up Border.
To remove diagonal lines, click the Eraser button and click or drag across 
the diagonals.
Drawing on a table
When you want to call attention to data in one part of a table, draw a circle 
around the data. By “draw” I mean make an Oval shape and place it over 
the data you want to highlight, as shown in Figure 5-10. Book I, Chapter 8 
explains the drawing tools in detail. To spare you the trouble of turning 
to that chapter, here are shorthand instructions for drawing on a table in 
Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher:

 1. On the Insert tab, click the Shapes button and select the Oval shape 
on the drop-down list.
 
Figure 5-10: 
You can 
circle data to 
highlight it.
 
 
2. On a corner of your page or slide, away from the table, drag to draw 
the oval.
 
 3. On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Shape Fill button and choose No Fill.
 
 4. Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button and choose a 
very dark color.
 
5. Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button, choose Weight, 
and choose a thick line.
 
6. Drag the oval over the data on your table that you want to highlight.
 
 If the oval is obscured by the table, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format 
tab, and click the Bring Forward button (click the Arrange button, if nec-
essary, to see this button). While you’re at it, consider rotating the oval 
a little way to make it appear as though it was drawn by hand on the 
table.
In the course of a live PowerPoint presentation, you can draw on slides with 
the Pen to highlight data. See Book IV, Chapter 4.

N
othing is more persuasive than a chart. The bars, pie slices, lines, or 
columns show instantaneously that production is up or down, that 
cats are better than dogs or dogs better than cats, or that catsup tastes 
better than ketchup. Fans of charts and graphs will be glad to know that put-
ting a chart in a Word document, Excel worksheet, or PowerPoint slide is 
fairly easy.
This chapter explains how to create a chart. It looks at which charts are 
best for presenting different kinds of data, how to change a chart’s appear-
ance, and how to save charts in a template that you can use again. You 
discover some nice chart tricks, including how to make a picture the back-
drop for a chart and how to annotate a chart. This chapter also addresses 
common chart problems.
A Mercifully Brief Anatomy Lesson
Throughout this chapter, I show you many ways to tinker with charts, but 
before you can begin tinkering, you need to know what you’re tinkering 
with. In other words, you have to know what the different parts of a chart 
are. Here is a brief chart anatomy lesson. Figure 6-1 points out where some 
of the terms described here are found on a real, live chart:

102
A Mercifully Brief Anatomy Lesson
 
✦ Plot area: The center of the chart, apart from the legend and data labels, 
where the data itself is presented.
 
✦ Values: The numerical values with which the chart is plotted. The values 
you enter determine the size of the data markers — the bars, columns, 
pie slices, and so on — that portray values. In the column chart in Figure 
6-1, values determine the height of the columns.
 
✦ Gridlines: Lines on the chart that indicate value measurements. 
Gridlines are optional in charts (none are shown in Figure 6-1).
 
✦ Worksheet: Where you enter (or retrieve) the data used to plot the 
chart. The worksheet resembles a table. Figure 6-2 shows the worksheet 
I used to enter the data that produced the chart in Figure 6-1. Notice 
how the numbers at the top of the columns correspond to the numbers 
entered in the worksheet shown in Figure 6-2. A worksheet is called a 
data table when it appears along with a chart.

The Basics: Creating a Chart
 
✦ Data series: A group of related data points presented by category on a 
chart. The chart in Figure 6-1 has two data series, one for Texas and one 
for Utah.
 
✦ Categories: The actual items that you want to compare or display in 
your chart. In Figure 6-1, the categories are the three years in which UFO 
sightings occurred in the two states.
 
✦ Legend: A text box located to the side, top, or bottom of a chart that 
identifies the chart’s data labels.
 
✦ Horizontal and vertical axes: For plotting purposes, one side of the plot 
area. In the chart in Figure 6-1, UFO sightings are plotted on the horizon-
tal axis; categories are plotted on the vertical axis. Sometimes these axes 
are called the category axis (or x axis) and the value axis (or y axis).
 
 Axes can be confusing, but these axes aren’t as evil as they seem. All you 
really need to know about them is this: You can label the axes in differ-
ent ways and you can rotate the chart so that the horizontal becomes 
the vertical axis and vice versa (click the Switch Row/Column button).
 
✦ Data point: A value plotted on a chart that is represented by a column, 
line, bar, pie slice, dot, or other shape. Each data point corresponds to 
a value entered in the worksheet. In Figure 6-1, for example, the data 
points for Texas UFO sightings are 14 in 2005, 11 in 2006, and 9 in 2007. 
Hence the Texas columns in the table rise to the 14, 11, and 9 level.
 
✦ Data marker: Shapes on a chart that represent data points. Data mark-
ers include columns, lines, pie slices, bubbles, and dots. In Figure 6-1, 
columns are the data markers.
 
✦ Data label: A label that shows the actual values used to construct the 
data markers. In the chart in Figure 6-1, there are six data labels, one on 
the top of each column. Displaying data labels in charts is optional.
 
The good news where the anatomy of a chart is concerned is that you can 
click anywhere on a chart and see a pop-up box that tells you what part of 
the chart you just clicked. I wish biology class were that easy!
The Basics: Creating a Chart
Throughout this chapter, I explain the whys, wherefores, and whatnots 
of creating a chart. Before going into details, here are the basic steps that 
everyone needs to know to create a chart in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
2. If you’re working in Excel, select the data you’ll use to generate the 
chart (in Word and PowerPoint, skip to Step 3).

104
 
 In Excel, you select the data on a worksheet before creating the chart, 
but in Word and PowerPoint, you enter the data for the chart in Excel in 
Step 4. Yes, you heard me right — in Word and PowerPoint. Excel opens 
after you begin creating your chart so you can enter data for the chart in 
an Excel worksheet.
 
3. Select the kind of chart you want.
 
 How you select a chart type depends on which program you’re 
working in:
 
• Excel: Either open the drop-down list in one of buttons in the Chart 
group on the Insert tab (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, Scatter, or 
Other Charts) and select a chart type, or click the Charts group 
button to open the Insert Chart dialog box and select a chart there. 
As shown in Figure 6-3, the Insert Chart dialog box shows all the 
kinds of charts you can create.
 
 
• Word and PowerPoint: Click the Chart button. You see the Insert 
Chart dialog box shown in Figure 6-3. Select a chart and click OK. The 
Excel program opens on the right side of your computer screen. (In 
PowerPoint, you can also click the Chart icon on a placeholder frame 
to open the Insert Chart dialog box.)
 
 The next portion of this chapter, “Choosing the Right Chart,” describes 
all the charts types and advises you which to choose.

4. In Word and PowerPoint, replace the sample data in the Excel work-
sheet with the data you need for generating your chart.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Providing the Raw Data for Your Chart” explains 
how to enter data in an Excel worksheet. After you finish entering the 
data, you can close Excel by clicking the Close button in the Excel 
window or going to the File tab and choosing Close.
 
5. To modify your chart, start by selecting it.
 
 Click a chart to select it. Selecting a chart makes the Chart Tools tabs 
appear in the upper-right corner of the window. Use these tabs — 
Design, Layout, and Format — to make your chart just-so.
 
 In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to see a chart.
 
6. Select the (Chart Tools) Design tab when you want to change the 
chart’s layout, alter the data with which the chart was generated, or 
select a different chart type.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Changing a Chart’s Appearance” explains how to 
change the design of a chart.
 
7. Select the (Chart Tools) Layout tab when you want to change the 
chart’s title, labels, or gridlines.
 
 You can add or remove parts of a chart starting on the Layout tab. 
Later in this chapter, “Changing the layout of a chart” describes how to 
change around the text and gridlines on a chart.
 
8. Select the (Chart Tools) Format tab when you want to change the 
appearance of your chart.
 
 You can change colors and fills on your chart, as “Changing a chart ele-
ment’s color, font, or other particular” explains later in this chapter.
And if you decide to delete the chart you created? Click its perimeter to 
select it and then press the Delete key.
Choosing the Right Chart
If you’re a fan of charts, the huge selection of charts can make you feel like a 
kid in a candy store, but if charts aren’t your forte, the wealth of charts you 
can choose from can be daunting. You can choose among 6 dozen charts in 
11 categories (refer to Figure 6-3). Which chart is best? The golden rule for 
choosing a chart type is to choose the one that presents information in the 
brightest possible light. The purpose of a chart is to compare information 
across different categories. Select a chart that draws out the comparison so 
that others can clearly make comparisons. Table 6-1 describes the 11 chart 
categories and explains in brief when to use each type of chart.
Choosing the Right Chart

106
Table 6-1 
Chart Types
Symbol
Chart Type
Best Use/Description
Area
Examine how values in different categories fluctuate over 
time, and see the cumulative change in values. (Same as 
a line chart except that the area between trend lines is 
colored in.)
Bar
Compare values in different categories against one another, 
usually over time. Data is displayed in horizontal bars. (Same 
as a column chart except that the bars are horizontal.)
Bubble
Examine data relationships by studying the size and loca-
tion of the bubbles that represent the relationships. Bubble 
charts are often used in financial analyses and market 
research. (Similar to an XY scatter chart except that you can 
use three rather than two data series, and the data points 
appear as bubbles.)
Column
Compare values in different categories against one another, 
usually over time. Data is displayed in vertical columns. 
(Same as a bar chart except that the bars are vertical.)
Doughnut
See how values compare as percentages of a whole. 
(Similar to a pie chart except that you can use more than 
one data series and create concentric doughnut rings in 
the chart.)
Line
Examine how values fluctuate over time. Data is displayed in 
a set of points connected by a line.
Pie
See how values compare as percentages of a whole. Data 
from categories is displayed as a percentage of a whole. 
(Similar to a doughnut chart.)
Radar
Examine data as it relates to one central point. Data is plot-
ted on radial points from the central point. This kind of chart 
is used to make subjective performance analyses.
XY 
(Scatter)
Compare different numeric data point sets in space to reveal 
patterns and trends in data. (Similar to a bubble chart except 
that the data appears as points rather than bubbles.)
Stock
See how the value of an item fluctuates, as well as its daily, 
weekly, or yearly high, low, and closing price. This chart is 
used to track stock prices, but it can also be used to track 
air temperature and other variable quantities.
Surface
Examine color-coded data on a 3-D surface to explore rela-
tionships between data values.
Choosing the Right Chart

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart

Providing the Raw Data for Your Chart
Every chart is constructed from raw data — the numbers and category 
names you select in an Excel worksheet (in Excel) or enter in an Excel work-
sheet (in Word and PowerPoint). If you’re operating in Word or PowerPoint, 
you see, in the Excel worksheet, sample data in a data range. The informa-
tion inside the data range is used to generate the chart. You can tell where 
the data range begins and ends because it is enclosed in a blue border. Your 
job is to replace the sample data in the data range with data of your own. As 
you enter your data, the chart on your slide or page takes shape.
Book V, Chapter 1 explains in detail how to enter data in an Excel worksheet, 
but here are the basics of entering data in case you’re new to Excel:
 
✦ Entering the data in a cell: A cell is the box in a worksheet where a 
column and row intersect; each cell can contain one data item. To 
enter data in a cell, click the cell and start typing. When you’re finished, 
press Enter, press Tab, or click a different cell. You can also click in the 
Formula bar (above the worksheet) and enter the data there.
 
✦ Deleting the data in a cell: To delete the data in a cell, including the 
sample data Excel provides for charts, click the cell and press Delete.
 
✦ Displaying the numbers: When a number is too large to fit in a cell, 
Excel displays pound signs (###) or displays the number in scientific 
notation. Don’t worry — the number is still recorded and is used to 
generate your chart. You can display large numbers by widening the 
columns in which the numbers are found. Move the pointer between 
column letters (A, B, and so on at the top of the worksheet) and when 
you see the double-headed arrow, click and drag to the right.
To enclose more or fewer cells in the data range, move the pointer to the 
lower-right corner of the data range, and when the pointer changes into a 
two-headed arrow, click and drag so that the blue box encloses only the data 
you want for your chart.
 
 In Word and PowerPoint, click the Edit Data button on the (Chart Tools) 
Design tab at any time to open Excel and fiddle with the numbers and data 
from which your chart is generated.
Positioning Your Chart in a Workbook, Page, or Slide
To change the position of a chart, click to select it, click its perimeter, and 
when you see the four-headed arrow, start dragging. Otherwise, follow these 
instructions to land your chart where you want it to be:
Positioning Your Chart in a Workbook, Page, or Slide

108
 
 
✦ Excel: To move your chart to a different worksheet or create a new 
worksheet to hold your chart, go to the (Chart Tools) Design tab and 
click the Move Chart button. You see the Move Chart dialog box.
 
• To move your chart to a different worksheet, click the Object In 
option button, choose the worksheet in the drop-down list, and 
click OK.
 
• To create a new worksheet for a chart, click the New Sheet option 
button, enter a name for the new worksheet, and click OK.
 
 
✦ Word: Starting in Print Layout view, select your chart, and in the Page 
Layout or (Chart Tools) Format tab, click the Position button (you may 
have to click the Arrange button first, depending on the size of your 
screen). You see a drop-down list with text-wrapping options. Choose 
the option that describes how you want surrounding text to behave 
when it crashes into your chart. Book II, Chapter 4 looks in detail at 
wrapping text around charts and other objects in Word.
 
✦ PowerPoint: Select the chart and drag it on the slide to the right position.
Changing a Chart’s Appearance
Charts are awfully nice already, but perhaps you want to redesign one. 
Perhaps you’re an interior decorator type and you want to give charts your 
own personal touch. Excel, PowerPoint, and Word offer these Chart Tools 
tabs for redecorating charts: 
 
✦ Design tab: For quickly changing a chart’s appearance. Go to the Design 
tab if you’re in a hurry. The ready-made gallery choices give you the 
opportunity to change a chart’s layout and appearance in a matter of 
seconds. You can also choose a new chart type from the Design tab. See 
“Relying on a chart style to change appearances,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Layout tab: For rearranging, hiding, and displaying various parts of a 
chart, including the legend, labels, title, gridlines, and scale. Go to the 
Layout tab to tweak your chart and make different parts of it stand out 
or recede into the background. For example, you can display axis labels 
more prominently or make them disappear, enter a title for your chart, 
or display more or fewer gridlines. See “Changing the layout of a chart” 
and “Handling the gridlines,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Format tab: For changing the color, outline, font, and font size of various 
parts of a chart, including the labels, bars, and pie slices. You have to 
really know what you’re doing and have a lot of time on your hands to 
change colors and fonts throughout a chart. See “Changing a chart ele-
ment’s color, font, or other particular,” later in this chapter.
Changing a Chart’s Appearance

Chapter 6
Creating a Chart

These pages explain how to change a chart’s appearance, starting with the 
biggest change you can make — exchanging one type of chart for another.
Changing the chart type
The biggest way to overhaul a chart is to ditch it in favor of a different chart 
type. Luckily for you, Office makes this task simple. I wish that changing jobs 
were this easy. Follow these steps to change a pumpkin into a carriage or an 
existing chart into a different kind of chart:
 
1. Click your chart to select it.
 
 2. On the (Chart Tools) Design tab, click the Change Chart Type button, 
or right-click your chart and choose Change Chart Type on the short-
cut menu.
 
 The Change Chart Type dialog box appears. Does it look familiar? This is 
the same dialog box you used to create your chart in the first place.
 
3. Select a new chart type and click OK.
 
 Not all chart types can be converted successfully to other chart types. 
You may well have created a monster, in which case go back to Step 1 
and start all over or click the Undo button.
Changing the size and shape of a chart
To make a chart taller or wider, follow these instructions:
 
✦ Click the perimeter of the chart to select it and then drag a handle on 
the side to make it wider, or a handle on the top or bottom to make it 
taller.
 
✦ Go to the (Chart Tools) Format tab and enter measurements in the 
Shape Height and Shape Width boxes. You can find these boxes in the 
Size group (you may have to click the Size button to see them, depend-
ing on the size of your screen).
Relying on a chart style to change appearances
The easiest way to change the look of a chart is to choose an option in the 
Chart Styles gallery in the (Chart Tools) Design tab, as shown in Figure 6-4. 
You can choose among 50 options. These gallery options are quite sophisti-
cated. You would have a hard time fashioning these charts on your own.
Changing a Chart’s Appearance

Select a Chart style
 
If your file includes more than one chart, make the charts consistent with 
one another. Give them a similar appearance so that your file doesn’t turn 
into a chart fashion show. You can make charts consistent with one another 
by choosing similar options for charts in the Chart Styles gallery.
Changing the layout of a chart
Figure 6-5 identifies the chart elements that you can lay out in different 
ways. Some of these elements can be removed as well as placed on different 
parts of a chart. For example, you can display the legend on any side of a 
chart or not display it at all. Some of the elements can be labeled in different 
ways. To decide on the layout of a chart, select it and visit the (Chart Tools) 
Layout tab.
 
The following pages explain how to change the layout of a chart starting on 
the (Chart Tools) Layout tab. However, before hurrying to the Layout tab to 
change your chart’s layout, you may consider taking a detour to the (Chart 
Tools) Design tab (refer to Figure 6-4). The Chart Layouts gallery on the 
Design tab offers ten ready-made layouts, one of which may meet your high 
expectations and spare you a trip to the Layout tab.

Deciding where chart elements appear and how they are labeled
On the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, open the drop-down list on these but-
tons and choose options to determine how and whether chart elements are 
labeled:
 
 
✦ Chart Title: The chart title appears above the chart and describes what 
the chart is about (refer to Figure 6-5). Place a centered title inside or 
above the chart. The Above Chart option shrinks the chart a bit to make 
room for the title. Click in the text box and enter the title after Office cre-
ates a chart title text box.
 
 
✦ Axis Titles: Axis titles list the series name and category name of the data 
being plotted in the chart (refer to Figure 6-5). You can select Rotated 
Title for the vertical axis to make the axis label read vertically rather 
than horizontally (refer to Figure 6-5).
 
 
✦ Legend: The legend is the box to the side, top, or bottom of the chart 
that describes what is being plotted (refer to Figure 6-5). Choose an 
option from the drop-down list to place the chart’s legend above, below, 
or to the side of a chart.
 
 
✦ Data Labels: Data labels show the numeric values by which the data 
markers — the bars, columns, pie slices, or dots — in your chart are 
constructed (refer to Figure 6-5). For example, if a bar in your chart rep-
resents the number 28, the data label 28 appears in the bar. You can also 
label the series name or category name by choosing More Data Label 
Options on the drop-down list and making selections in the Format Data 
Labels dialog box.
Changing a Chart’s Appearance

112
 
 
✦ Axes: The axes labels are the series names and scale markers that 
appear in the chart. Choose Primary Horizontal Axis or Primary Vertical 
Axis and then select None to remove series names and scale markers 
from your chart. The other axes options are for deciding how to display 
axes labels (and are explained in the next section of this chapter).
Deciding how the chart’s scale and axes labels are presented
The labels and scale on the horizontal and vertical axes of a chart tell view-
ers what is being plotted on the chart (refer to Figure 6-5). By clicking the 
Axes button on the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, you can fine-tune the axes 
labels and scale on your chart.
 
 After you click the Axes button, you see options for changing around your 
chart’s horizontal or vertical axis. What the horizontal and vertical axis 
options are depends on whether the axis you’re dealing with presents text 
labels, expresses numerical values, or expresses date values.
Text axis options
Choose a text axis option on the drop-down list to remove the labels or pres-
ent category name labels in reverse order from the way in which these labels 
are listed on the worksheet.
Numerical and date axis options
The axis options that pertain to numbers and dates are for declaring how to 
present the scale on your chart. You can present the numbers in thousands, 
millions, billions, or with a log scale. By opening the Format Axis dialog box 
shown in Figure 6-6, you can get quite specific about how the scale is pre-
sented on your chart. To open this dialog box, click the Axes button, select 
the appropriate axis option on the drop-down list, and choose More Options 
on the submenu. Which options you see in this dialog box depends greatly 
on which chart type you’re dealing with.
The Format Axis dialog box offers these opportunities for changing around 
the scale of a chart:
 
✦ Changing the scale’s range: By default, the scale ranges from 0 to 10 
percent more than the largest value being plotted, but you can change 
the scale’s range by selecting a Fixed option button and entering a new 
value in the Minimum and Maximum text box.
 
✦ Changing the number of unit measurement labels: Label measure-
ments (and gridlines) appear at intervals on a chart according to the 
number entered in the Major Unit text box. For example, an entry of 10 
tells Office to mark each 10 units with a measurement label. Select the 
Fixed option button and change the number in the Major Unit text box 
to draw fewer or more unit labels (and gridlines) on your chart. If your 
chart displays minor tick marks, do the same in the Minor Unit text box.

dialog box.
 
 
✦ Displaying numbers as thousandths, millionths, or billionths: If your 
chart presents large numbers, consider listing these numbers in thou-
sandths, millionths, or billionths by selecting an option in the Display 
Units drop-down list. You can also select the Logarithmic Scale check 
box to display numbers as logarithms.
 
✦ Changing the tick-mark scale markers: Choose Tick Mark options to tell 
Office where or whether to place tick marks — small unit markers — on 
the scale.
 
✦ Changing the location of axis labels: Choose an option in the Axis Labels 
drop-down list to tell Office where to place the unit labels on the scale.
 
✦ Change the axis crosses: Select the Axis Value option button and enter 
a measurement in the Axis Value text box if you want to change the 
baseline of your chart. Usually, the axis value is set to 0, and markers 
rise from 0 on the chart; but by entering a different measurement, you 
can make markers rise or fall from the baseline. For example, if the Axis 
Value baseline is 5, markers less than 5 fall from a baseline in the middle 
of the chart and markers greater than 5 rise above it.
Handling the gridlines
Gridlines are lines that cross a chart and indicate value measurements. Most 
charts include major gridlines to show where bars or columns meet or sur-
pass a major unit of measurement, and you can also include fainter, minor 
gridlines that mark less significant measurements. Figure 6-7 shows a chart 
with gridlines displayed in different ways.

Gridlines or Primary Vertical Gridlines on the drop-down list, and choose 
an option on the submenu. You can hide gridlines (by choosing None), 
display major gridlines, display minor gridlines, or display major and 
minor gridlines (refer to Figure 6-7).
 
 The frequency of gridlines on a chart is tied to the scale. If you want to 
control the frequency of the gridlines on your own without relying on 
a Gridlines option, change your chart’s scale. The preceding section in 
this chapter explains how to handle scales.
 
✦ Changing gridline width: On the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the 
Chart Elements drop-down list and choose Axis Major Gridlines or Axis 
Minor Gridlines (display gridlines on your chart if you don’t see these 
options). Then click the Format Selection button, and in the Line Style 
category of the Format Gridlines dialog box, enter a measurement in the 
Width text box to make the gridlines heavier or thinner.
 
 
✦ Changing gridline color: On the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the 
Chart Elements drop-down list and select Axis Major Gridlines or Axis 
Minor Gridlines. (Display gridlines on your chart if you don’t see these 
options.) Then open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button and 
choose a color. You can also click the Format Selection button, and in 
the Line Color category of the Format Gridlines dialog box, select the 
Solid Line option button and then click the Color button and choose a 
color there.

Gridlines are essential for helping read charts, but be very, very careful 
about displaying minor gridlines on charts. These lines can make your chart 
unreadable. They can turn a perfectly good chart into a gaudy pinstripe suit.
Changing a chart element’s color, 
font, or other particular
Generally speaking, the (Chart Tools) Format tab is the place to go to 
change the color, line width, font, or font size of a chart element. As I explain 
shortly, you can do some interior decorating tasks on the (Chart Tools) 
Layout tab as well.
Follow these basic steps to change a color, line width, font, or font size in 
part of a chart:
 
1. Select the (Chart Tools) Format tab.
 
 The tools on the (Chart Tools) Format tab are very similar to the tools 
found on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab. You can find all the tools 
you need here to change the color, outline, and size of a chart element. 
These tools are explained in detail in Book I, Chapter 8.
 
2. Select the chart element that needs a facelift.
 
 To select a chart element, either click it or choose its name on the Chart 
Elements drop-down list, as shown in Figure 6-8. You can find this list in 
the upper-left corner of the window.
 
3. Format the chart element you selected.
 
 Use one of these techniques to format the chart element:
 
 
• Open a Format dialog box. Click the Format Selection button to open 
a Format dialog box. The dialog box offers commands for formatting 
the element you selected.
 
• Do the work on your own. Format the chart element as you would 
any object. For example, to change fonts in the chart element you 
selected, right-click and choose a font on the shortcut menu. Or go 
to the Home tab to change font sizes. Or open the drop-down list on 
the Shape Fill button on the (Chart Tools) Format tab and select a 
new color.

The (Chart Tools) Layout tab also offers these convenient commands for 
changing the color of a chart element:
 
 
✦ Plot area: The plot area is the rectangle in which the chart’s gridlines, bars, 
columns, pie slices, or lines appear. In some chart designs, the plot area is 
filled with color. To remove this color or choose a different color, click the 
Plot Area button and choose an option. Choose More Plot Area Options to 
open the Format Plot Area dialog box and select a new fill color.
 
✦ 3-D chart wall and chart floor: Three-dimensional charts have chart walls 
and a chart floor. The chart wall forms the backdrop of a 3-D chart; the chart 
floor forms the bottom of the chart. Click the Chart Wall button and choose 
an option to remove the chart wall or change its color; click the Chart Floor 
button and choose an option to remove the chart floor or change its color.
Saving a Chart as a Template So 
That You Can Use It Again
If you go to the significant trouble of redecorating a chart and you expect to 
do it again the same way in the future, save your chart as a template. This 
way, you can call on the template in the future to create the same chart 
and not have to decorate it again. Perhaps you’ve created charts with your

company’s colors or you’ve created a chart that you’re especially proud of. 
Save it as a template to spare yourself the work of reconstructing it.
A chart template holds data series colors, gridline settings, plot area colors, font 
settings, and the like. It doesn’t hold data. These pages explain how to save a 
chart as a template and how to create a chart with a template you created.
Saving a chart as a template
Follow these steps to make a template out of a chart:
 
1. Save your file to make sure that the chart settings are saved on your 
computer.
 
2. Select your chart.
 
3. Go to the (Chart Tools) Design tab.
 
 4. Click the Save As Template button.
 
 
 You can find this button in the Type group. You see the Save Chart 
Template dialog box.
 
5. Enter a descriptive name for the template and click the Save button.
 
 Include the type of chart you’re dealing with in the name. This will help 
you understand which template you’re selecting when the time comes to 
choose a chart template.
 
By default, chart templates are saved in this folder in Windows 7 and 
Windows Vista: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\
Templates\Charts. Chart templates are stored in this folder in Windows 
XP: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\
Microsoft\Templates\Charts. The templates have the .ctrx exten-
sion. If you want to delete or rename a template, open the Charts folder 
in Windows Explorer or Computer and do your deleting and renaming 
there. You can open the Charts folder very quickly by clicking the Manage 
Templates button in the Insert Chart dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3).
Creating a chart from a template
To create a chart from your own customized template, open the Create 
Chart dialog box (click the Chart button) and go to the Templates category. 
The dialog box shows a list of templates you created. Move the pointer over 
a template to read its name in a pop-up box. Select a template and click OK.

how to decorate a chart with a picture, annotate a chart, display worksheet 
data alongside a chart, and create an overlay chart.
Decorating a chart with a picture
As shown in Figure 6-9, a picture looks mighty nice on the plot area of a 
chart — especially a column chart. If you have a picture in your computer 
that would serve well to decorate a chart, you are hereby encouraged to start 
decorating. Follow these steps to place a picture in the plot area of a chart:
 
1. Select your chart.
 
2. On the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down 
list and choose Plot Area.
 
 3. Click the Shape Fill button and choose Picture on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Insert Picture dialog box.
 
4. Locate the picture you need and select it.
 
 Try to select a light-colored picture that will serve as a background. 
Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how you can recolor a picture to make it 
lighter.
 
5. Click the Insert button.
 
 The picture lands in your chart.
 
 You may need to change the color of the data markers — the columns, 
bars, lines, or pie slices — on your chart to make them stand out against 
the picture. See “Changing a chart element’s color, font, or other particu-
lar,” earlier in this chapter.

Annotating a chart
To highlight part of a chart — an especially large pie slice, a tall column, or a 
bar showing miniscule sales figures — annotate it with a callout text box and 
place the text box beside the pie slice, column, or bar. Figure 6-10 shows an 
example of an annotated chart. The annotation tells you that one sector isn’t 
performing especially well and somebody ought to get on the ball.
 
Figure 6-10: 
Annotations 
point out 
a chart’s 
salient 
features.
 
To annotate a chart, select a callout shape, enter text in the callout shape, 
and connect the shape to part of your chart. Follow these steps to annotate 
a chart:
 
1. Select your chart and go to the (Chart Tools) Layout tab.
 
 2. Click the Shapes button, scroll to the Callouts section of the drop-
down list, and choose a callout.
 
 Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Insert 
button to get to the Shapes button.
 
3. Drag on your slide to draw the callout shape.
 
 Book I, Chapter 8 explains drawing shapes in gory detail.
 
4. Type the annotation inside the callout shape.
 
5. Resize the callout shape as necessary to make it fit with the chart.
 
6. Drag the yellow diamond on the callout shape to attach the callout to 
the chart.
 
 You probably have to do some interior decorating to make the callout 
color fit with the chart. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to change an 
object’s color.

Displaying the raw data alongside the chart
Showing the worksheet data used to produce a chart is sort of like showing 
the cops your ID. It proves you’re the real thing. It makes your chart more 
authentic. If yours is a simple pie chart or other chart that wasn’t generated 
with a large amount of raw data, you can display the data alongside your 
chart in a data table. Anyone who sees the table knows you’re not kidding or 
fudging the numbers.
Select your chart and use of one of these techniques to place a table with the 
raw data below your chart:
 
 
✦ On the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, click the Data Table button and choose 
an option on the drop-down list.
 
✦ On the (Chart Tools) Design tab, open the Chart Layouts gallery and 
select a layout that includes a data table.
 
To format a data table, go to the (Chart Tools) Format tab, open the Chart 
Element drop-down list and choose Data Table. Then click the Format 
Selection button. You see the Format Data Table dialog box, where you can 
fill the table with color and choose colors for the lines in the table.
Creating an overlay chart
An overlay chart is a secondary chart that appears over another chart, the 
idea being to contrast two sets of data. Create an overlay chart by selecting 
one data series in a chart you already created and instructing Office to use 
the data in the series for the overlay chart. To create an overlay chart, the 
original chart must plot more than one data series. Figure 6-11 shows a bar 
chart overlaying a stacked area chart.

121
Follow these steps to create an overlay chart:
 
1. In a chart you created, click to select the data series that you will use 
to create the secondary chart.
 
 The easiest way to select a data series is to click the chart itself, but you 
can also go to the (Chart Tools) Format tab and select a series in the 
Chart Elements drop-down list.
 
2. Right-click the data series you selected and choose Change Series 
Chart Type.
 
 You see the Change Chart Type dialog box.
 
3. Choose a chart type for the overlay chart and click OK.
 
 Be sure to click a chart type different from the one in the other chart.
Placing a trendline on a chart
Especially on column charts, a trendline can help viewers more clearly see 
changes in data. Viewers can see, for example, that sales are going up or 
down, income is rising or falling, or annual rainfall is increasing or decreas-
ing. Figure 6-12 shows an example of a trendline on a chart. In this case, the 
trendline shows that the deer population in Sacramento County is rising.
 
Figure 6-12: 
A trendline 
helps 
viewers 
recognize 
changes in 
data.
 
Follow these steps to put a trendline on a chart:
 
1. On the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down 
list and choose the data series that you want to highlight with a 
trendline.

 2. Click the Trendline button and choose a trendline option on the drop-
down list.
 
 You can choose More Trendline Options on the drop-down list to open the 
Format Trendline dialog box and choose additional types of trendlines.
 
 To change the look of a trendline, right-click it and choose Format 
Trendline. In the Format Trendline dialog box, choose a line color and 
line style.
To remove a trendline from a chart, go to the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, click 
the Trendline button, and choose None on the drop-down list.
Troubleshooting a Chart
Sometimes tinkering with a chart opens a Pandora’s box of problems. You 
find yourself having to correct little errors that appear in charts. Here are 
some shorthand instructions for fixing common chart problems:
 
✦ The dates in the chart aren’t formatted right. To change the way in 
which dates are formatted on a chart, go to the (Chart Tools) Format 
tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down list, and choose Horizontal 
(Value) Axis or Vertical (Value) Axis. Then click the Format Selection 
button, and in the Format Axis dialog box, go to the Number category, 
select Date in the Category menu, and choose a date format.
 
✦ The numbers in the chart aren’t formatted right. To change the 
number of decimal places, include comma separators in numbers, dis-
play currency symbols, or do all else that pertains to numbers, go to the 
(Chart Tools) Format tab, open the Chart Elements drop-down list, and 
choose Horizontal (Value) Axis or Vertical (Value) Axis. Then click the 
Format Selection button. You see the Format Axis dialog box. Visit the 
Number category and select options for displaying numbers.
 
✦ “Category 1” or “Series 1” appears in the chart legend. To direct you 
to the right place to enter data in Excel worksheets, phantom names 
such as “Category 1” and “Series 1” appear in worksheets. Sometimes 
these phantoms wind up in chart legends as well. To remove them, go 
to the (Chart Tools) Design tab and click the Edit Data button. You see 
the Excel worksheet, where the data range used to generate the chart is 
enclosed in a blue box. Drag the lower-right corner of the box so that the 
box encloses only the data you want for your chart.
Troubleshooting a Chart

Book I
Chapter 6
Creating a Chart
123
 
✦ In 3-D charts, small markers are obscured by large markers in the 
foreground. For all the data markers to be shown in a 3-D chart, the 
smaller ones have to be in the foreground. To rearrange data markers, 
go to the (Chart Tools) Design tab and click the Select Data button to 
open the Select Data Source dialog box. Then select a series and click 
the Up or Down button to rearrange the series in your chart. Series that 
are high on the list go to the back of the chart; series that are low on the 
list go to the front.
 
✦ The chart doesn’t gather all data from the worksheet. On the (Chart 
Tools) Design tab, click the Edit Data button, and in the Excel worksheet 
that stores data for your chart, enlarge the blue data-range box so that 
it encloses all your data. You can enlarge the box by dragging its lower-
right corner.
 
✦ The scale is too big for my chart. Especially if the scale range on a 
chart is small, the scale can be too big compared to the data markers. 
To change the scale range, go to the (Chart Tools) Layout tab, click the 
Axes button, choose the appropriate axis option on the drop-down list, 
and choose More Options. Then, in the Format Axis dialog box, select 
the Fixed option button and enter a Maximum value to establish the 
top of the scale for your chart. For more details, see “Deciding how the 
chart’s scale and axes labels are presented,” earlier in this chapter.

✓ Creating a diagram from shapes
A
long with charts and tables, diagrams are the best way to present your 
ideas. Diagrams clearly show, for example, employees’ relationships 
with one another, product cycles, workflow processes, and spheres of influ-
ence. A diagram is an excellent marriage of images and words. Diagrams 
allow an audience to literally visualize a concept, idea, or relationship.
This chapter explains how to construct diagrams from SmartArt graphics 
and how to create a diagram. It shows how to customize diagrams by chang-
ing the size of diagrams and diagram shapes, adding and removing shapes, 
and changing shapes’ colors. You also discover how to change the direction 
of a diagram and enter the text. Finally, this chapter demonstrates how to 
create a diagram from scratch with shapes and connectors.
The Basics: Creating SmartArt Diagrams
In Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, diagrams are made from SmartArt graphics. 
These diagram graphics are “interactive” in the sense that you can move, 
alter, and write text on them. In other words, you can use them to construct 
diagrams. You can alter these diagrams to your liking. You can make a dia-
gram portray precisely what you want it to portray, although you usually 
have to wrestle with the diagram a bit.
The first step in creating a diagram is to select a layout in the Choose a 
SmartArt Graphic dialog box, shown in Figure 7-1. After you create the initial 
diagram, you customize it to create a diagram of your own. About 120 dia-
grams are in the dialog box. They fall into these eight categories:

Diagram explanation
 
If you intend to construct a “flow chart type” diagram with many branches 
and levels, go to the Hierarchy category and select the Organization Chart or 
one of the hierarchy diagrams. As “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes” explains 
later in this chapter, only these choices permit you to make a diagram with 
many different branches and levels.

Book I
Chapter 7
Making a SmartArt 
Diagram
127
Creating the Initial Diagram
After you select a generic diagram in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog 
box and click OK, the next step is to make the diagram your own by complet-
ing these tasks:
 
✦ Change the diagram’s size and position: Change the size and position 
of a diagram to make it fit squarely on your page or slide. See “Changing 
the Size and Position of a Diagram,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Add shapes to (or remove shapes from) the diagram: Adding a shape 
involves declaring where to add the shape, promoting or demoting the 
shape with respect to other shapes, and declaring how the new shape 
connects to another shape. See “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes,” later 
in this chapter.
 
✦ Enter text: Enter text on each shape, or component, of the diagram. See 
“Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes,” later in this chapter.
If you so desire, you can also customize your diagram by taking on some or 
all of these tasks:
 
✦ Changing its overall appearance: Choose a different color scheme or 
3-D variation for your diagram. See “Choosing a Look for Your Diagram,” 
later in this chapter.
 
✦ Changing shapes: Select a new shape for part of your diagram, change 
the size of a shape, or assign different colors to shapes to make shapes 
stand out. See “Changing the Appearance of Diagram Shapes,” later in 
this chapter.
If you’re comfortable creating a diagram of your own by drawing shapes and 
lines, no law says that you have to begin in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic 
dialog box. Later in this chapter, “Creating a Diagram from Scratch” looks 
into creating a diagram by making use of text boxes, lines, and shapes.
Creating the Initial Diagram
The first step in fashioning a diagram is to choose a SmartArt graphic in the 
Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box. After that, you roll up your sleeves, 
change the diagram’s size and shape, and enter the text. If you select the 
wrong diagram to start with, all is not lost. You can choose another diagram 
in its place, although how successful swapping one diagram for another is 
depends on how lucky you are and how far along you are in creating your 
diagram. These pages explain how to create an initial diagram and swap one 
diagram for another.

128
Creating the Initial Diagram
Creating a diagram
Follow these steps to create a diagram:
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the SmartArt button.
 
 
 You see the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box (refer to Figure 7-1). 
In PowerPoint, you can also open the dialog box by clicking the SmartArt 
icon in a content placeholder frame.
 
2. Select a diagram in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box.
 
 Diagrams are divided into eight categories, as I explain earlier in this 
chapter. The dialog box offers a description of each diagram. Either 
select a type on the left side of the dialog box or scroll the entire list to 
find the graphic that most resembles the diagram you want.
 
 If you want to create a graph with many levels and branches, go to the 
Hierarchy category and select one of these charts: Organization Chart, 
Picture Organization Chart, or Name and Title Organization Chart. These 
three diagrams are much more complex than the others and allow for 
branching. See “Laying Out the Diagram Shapes” later in this chapter for 
details.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The next topic in this chapter explains how to swap one diagram for 
another, in case you chose wrongly in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic 
dialog box.
Swapping one diagram for another
If the diagram you chose initially doesn’t do the job, you can swap it for a 
different diagram. How successful the swap is depends on how far along you 
Starting from a sketch
You can spare yourself a lot of trouble by start-
ing from a sketch when you create a diagram. 
Find a pencil with a good eraser, grab a blank 
piece of paper, and start drawing. Imagine 
what your ideal diagram looks like. Draw the 
arrows or lines connecting the different parts 
of the diagram. Write the text. Draw the dia-
gram that best illustrates what you want to 
communicate.
Later, in the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog 
box (refer to Figure 7-1), you can select the 
diagram that most resembles the one you 
sketched. The dialog box offers 120 types of 
diagrams. Unless you start from a sketch and 
have a solid idea of the diagram you want, you 
can get lost in the dialog box. Also, if you don’t 
start from a sketch, adding shapes to the dia-
gram and landing them in the right places can 
be a chore.

are in creating your diagram and whether your diagram is simple or com-
plex. Follow these steps to swap one diagram for another:
 
1. Click your diagram to select it.
 
2. Go to the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
 
3. Open the Layouts gallery (you may have to click the Change Layout 
button first).
 
 You see a gallery with diagrams of the same type as the diagram you’re 
working with.
 
4. Select a new diagram or choose More Layouts to open the Choose a 
SmartArt Graphic dialog box and select a diagram there.
You may have to click the trusty Undo button and start all over if the dia-
gram you selected for the swap didn’t do the job.
Changing the Size and Position of a Diagram
To make a diagram fit squarely on a page or slide, you have to change its 
size and position. Resizing and positioning diagrams and other objects is the 
subject of Book I, Chapter 8, but in case you don’t care to travel that far to 
get instructions, here are shorthand instructions for resizing and positioning 
diagrams:
 
 
✦ Resizing a diagram: Select the diagram, move the pointer over a selec-
tion handle on the corner or side, and start dragging after the pointer 
changes into a two-headed arrow. You can also go to the (SmartArt 
Tools) Format tab and enter new measurements in the Width and Height 
boxes. (You may have to click the Size button to see these text boxes, 
depending on the size of your screen.)
 
 
✦ Repositioning a diagram: Select the diagram, move the pointer over its 
perimeter, and when you see the four-headed arrow, click and start 
dragging.
Notice when you resize a diagram that the shapes in the diagram change 
size proportionally. Most diagrams are designed so that shapes fill out the 
diagram. When you change the size of a diagram, remove a shape from a dia-
gram, or add a shape, shapes change size within the diagram.
Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
At the heart of every diagram are the rectangles, circles, arrows, and what-
nots that make the diagram what it is. These shapes illustrate the concept 
or idea you want to express to your audience. Your biggest challenge when 
creating a diagram is laying out the diagram shapes.

130
Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
The following pages explain how to select diagram shapes, add shapes, repo-
sition shapes, and remove shapes from diagrams. They also offer instruc-
tions specific to working with hierarchy diagrams.
Selecting a diagram shape
 
 Before you can remove a shape from a diagram or indicate where you want 
to add a new shape, you have to select a diagram shape. To select a diagram 
shape, move the pointer over its perimeter and click when you see the four-
headed arrow underneath your pointer.
 
You can tell when a diagram shape is selected because a solid line, not a 
dotted line, appears around the shape, as shown in Figure 7-2. When you see 
dotted lines around a shape, you’re expected to enter text.
 
Figure 7-2: 
A selected 
diagram 
shape is 
surrounded 
by solid 
lines.
 
Selected diagram shape
Removing a shape from a diagram
Removing a shape from a diagram is as easy as falling off a turnip truck as 
long as you correctly select the shape before you remove it. To remove 
a shape, select it and press Delete. Other shapes grow larger when you 
remove a shape, in keeping with the “fill out the diagram by any means nec-
essary” philosophy.
Moving diagram shapes to different positions
 
 
If a shape in a diagram isn’t in the right position, don’t fret — you can 
change the order of shapes very easily by going to the (SmartArt Tools) 
Design tab and clicking the Move Up or Move Down button.
 
 Select the diagram shape that needs repositioning and click the Move Up 
or Move Down button as many times as necessary to land the shape in the 
right place.

Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
Adding shapes to diagrams apart 
from hierarchy diagrams
Unlike hierarchy diagrams, list, process, cycle, relationship, and matrix dia-
grams don’t have branches. They always travel in one direction only. This 
makes adding shapes to these diagrams fairly straightforward. To add a 
shape, you select a shape in the diagram and then add the new shape so that 
it appears before or after the shape you selected, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
Figure 7-3: 
To add a 
shape, start 
by selecting

new shape 
will go 
before or 
after.
 
The new shape
Select a shape and choose an Add Shape option
Follow these steps to add a shape to a list, process, cycle, relationship, 
matrix, or pyramid diagram:
 
1. In your diagram, select the shape that your new shape will appear 
before or after.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” explains how to 
select diagram shapes.
 
2. Choose the Add Shape After or Add Shape Before command.
 
 To get to these commands, use one of these techniques:
 
 
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Add Shape button and choose Add Shape After or Add Shape 
Before(refer to Figure 7-3).
 
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose Add Shape After or Add Shape Before on 
the submenu.

Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
 
Although the Add Shape drop-down list offers an Add Shape Above and Add 
Shape Below command (refer to Figure 7-3), these commands don’t apply to 
list, process, cycle, relationship, or matrix diagrams. Ignore them. They’re 
strictly for hierarchy and pyramid diagrams.
Adding shapes to hierarchy diagrams
Hierarchy diagrams are more complex than other diagrams because they 
branch out such that shapes are found on different levels. This branching 
out makes adding shapes to hierarchy diagrams problematic.
As shown in Figure 7-4, Office offers four Add Shape commands for adding 
shapes to hierarchy diagrams: Add Shape After, Add Shape Before, Add 
Shape Above, and Add Shape Below. What these commands do depends on 
whether the diagram is horizontally or vertically oriented, because what 
constitutes after, before, above, and below is different in vertical and hori-
zontal diagrams. Suffice it to say that when you add shapes to hierarchy dia-
grams, you often have to try different commands, clicking the Undo button 
and starting all over until you get it right.

Select a shape and choose one of four Add Shape commands
Follow these steps to add a shape to a hierarchy diagram:
 
1. In your diagram, select the shape to which your new shape will be 
connected.

Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” describes how to 
select a shape.
 
2. Choose an Add Shape command.
 
 Figure 7-4 shows what Add Shape commands do. You can choose Add 
Shape commands with one of these techniques:
 
 
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Add Shape button and choose an Add Shape command (refer to 
Figure 7-4).
 
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose an Add Shape command.
Adding shapes to Organization charts
An Organization chart diagram offers many opportunities for connecting 
shapes. The shapes can branch out from one another in four directions as 
well as appear to the side in the “assistant” position. When you place one 
shape below another shape, you can make the new shape hang so that it 
is joined to a line that drops, or hangs, from another shape. These pages 
explain how to add shapes and create hanging relationships between one 
shape and the shapes subordinate to it.
Adding an Organization Chart shape
Besides adding a shape after, before, above, or below a shape, you can add 
an assistant shape to an Organization Chart diagram, as shown in Figure 7-5. 
An assistant shape is an intermediary shape between two levels. Follow these 
steps to add a shape to an Organization Chart diagram:
 
1. Select the shape to which you will add a new shape.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting a diagram shape” explains how to 
select shapes. As shown in Figure 7-5, shapes are surrounded by solid 
lines, not dotted lines, when you select them properly.
 
2. Choose an Add Shape command.
 
 You can choose Add Shape commands in two ways:
 
 
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Add Shape button and choose an Add Shape command (refer to 
Figure 7-5).
 
• Right-click the shape you selected, choose Add Shape on the short-
cut menu, and then choose an Add Shape command on the submenu.
 
 Figure 7-5 demonstrates what the Add Shape commands do. Notice 
that Add Shape Before places a new shape to the left of the shape you 
selected; Add Shape After places a new shape to the right.

134
Laying Out the Diagram Shapes
 
Figure 7-5:

Select a shape and choose one of five Add Shape commands
  Be careful about choosing the Add Shape Above command. This command 
effectively bumps the shape you selected to a lower level in order to make 
room for the new shape. In effect, you demote one shape when you place a 
new shape above it.
 
Shapes created by the Add Assistant command land on the left side of the 
line to which they’re attached, but if you prefer the assistant shape to be on 
the right side of the line, you can drag it to the right.
Hanging a shape below another shape in an Organization Chart
Besides the standard relationship between shapes above and below one 
another, you can create a hanging relationship in an Organization Chart dia-
gram. Figure 7-6 shows the three kinds of hanging relationships — Standard, 
Both, Left Hanging, and Right Hanging. In a hanging relationship, the line 
hangs from a shape, and subordinate shapes are connected to the line.
You can create a hanging relationship between shapes before or after you 
create the subordinate shapes. Follow these steps to create a hanging 
relationship:
 
1. Select the shape to which other shapes will hang or are hanging.
 
 2. On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, click the Layout button.

3. On the drop-down list, choose Both, Left Hanging, or Right Hanging.
 
 The Standard option on the drop-down list is for creating a standard 
relationship, not a hanging relationship.
Promoting and demoting shapes in 
hierarchy diagrams
Shapes in hierarchy diagrams are ranked by level. If a shape is on the 
wrong level, you can move it higher or lower in the diagram by clicking the 
Promote or Demote button on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab. Promoting 
and demoting shapes can turn into a donnybrook if you aren’t careful. If the 
shapes being promoted or demoted are attached to subordinate shapes, the 
subordinate shapes are promoted or demoted as well. This can have unfore-
seen and sometimes horrendous consequences.
Follow these steps to promote or demote a shape (and its subordinates) in a 
hierarchy diagram:
 
1. Select the shape that needs a change of rank.
 
 You can select more than one shape by Ctrl+clicking.
 
2. Go to the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab.
 3. Click the Promote or Demote button.
 
 Do you like what you see? If not, you may have to click the Undo button and 
start all over.

Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes
Handling the Text on Diagram Shapes
When you create a new diagram, “[Text]” (the word Text enclosed in brack-
ets) appears on shapes. Your job is to replace this generic placeholder with 
something more meaningful and less bland. These sections explain how to 
enter text and bulleted lists on shapes. 
Entering text on a diagram shape
Use one of these techniques to enter text on a diagram shape:
 
✦ Click in the shape and start typing: The words you type appear in the 
shape, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
✦ Enter text in the Text pane: Enter the text by typing it in the Text pane, 
as shown in Figure 7-7. The text pane opens to the left of the diagram. To 
open the text pane:
 
 
• On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, click the Text Pane button.
 
 
• Click the Text Pane button on the diagram. This button is not 
labeled, but you can find it to the left of the diagram.

Changing a Diagram’s Direction
The text in diagrams shrinks as you enter more text so that all text is the 
same size. If you want to make the text larger or smaller in one shape, see 
“Changing fonts and font sizes on shapes,” later in this chapter.
Entering bulleted lists on diagram shapes
Some diagram shapes have built-in bulleted lists, but no matter. Whether a 
shape is prepared to be bulleted or not, you can enter bullets in a diagram 
shape. Here are instructions for entering and removing bullets:
 
 
✦ Entering a bulleted list: Select the shape that needs bullets, and on the 
(SmartArt Tools) Design tab, click the Add Bullet button. Either enter 
the bulleted items directly into the shape (pressing Enter as you type 
each entry) or click the Text Pane button to open the Text pane (refer to 
Figure 7-7) and enter bullets there.
 
✦ Removing bulleted items: Click before the first bulleted entry and keep 
pressing the Delete key until you have removed all the bulleted items. 
You can also start in the Text pane (refer to Figure 7-7) and press the 
Delete key there until you’ve removed the bulleted items, or drag to 
select several bulleted items and then press Delete.
Changing a Diagram’s Direction
As long as your diagram is horizontally oriented, you can change its direc-
tion. As shown in Figure 7-8, you can flip it over such that the rightmost 
shape in your diagram becomes the leftmost shape, and what was the left-
most shape becomes the rightmost shape. If arrows are in your diagram, the 
Turning a bulleted list into a diagram (PowerPoint)
Suppose you’re working along in PowerPoint 
when suddenly the realization strikes you that 
a bulleted list in a text frame or text box would 
work much better as a diagram. For those 
occasions, you click the Convert to SmartArt 
button. By clicking this button, you can turn the 
text in a text frame or text box into a diagram. 
If the text frame or box contains a bulleted list, 
each bulleted item becomes a diagram shape.
Follow these steps to turn a text frame or text 
box into a diagram:
 1. Select the text frame or text box.
 2. On the Home tab, click the Convert to 
SmartArt button.
 
 You see a drop-down list with basic dia-
gram choices.
 3. Either select a diagram on the list or 
choose More SmartArt Graphics to open 
the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box 
and select a diagram there.

Choosing a Look for Your Diagram
arrows point the opposite direction after you flip the diagram. You can’t flip 
vertically oriented diagrams this way. Sorry, but diagrams that run north to 
south, not west to east, can’t be rolled over.
 
Figure 7-8: 
You can flip 
horizontal 
diagrams so 
that they run

Follow these steps to flip a horizontally oriented diagram:
 
1. Select the diagram.
 
 2. On the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab, click the Right to Left button.
 
 If you don’t like what you see, click the button again or click the Undo 
button.
Choosing a Look for Your Diagram
Decide how a diagram looks by starting on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab. 
Starting there, you can choose a color scheme for your diagram and a differ-
ent style. Between the Change Colors drop-down list and the SmartArt Styles 
gallery, you can find a combination of options that presents your diagram in 
the best light:
 
 
✦ Change Colors button: Click the Change Colors button to see color 
schemes for your diagram on the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 7-9. 
Point at a few options to live-preview them.
 
✦ SmartArt Styles gallery: Open the SmartArt Styles gallery to choose 
simple and 3-D variations on the diagram.

 If you experiment too freely and want to backpedal, click the Reset Graphic 
button on the (SmartArt Tools) Design tab. Clicking this button reverses all 
the formatting changes you made to your diagram.
 
If your Word document, Excel worksheet, or PowerPoint presentation 
includes many diagrams, make sure that your diagrams are consistent in 
appearance. Choose similar colors for diagrams. If you like 3-D diagrams, 
make the majority of your diagrams 3-D. Don’t let the diagrams overwhelm 
the ideas they are meant to express. The point is to present ideas in dia-
grams, not turn your work into a SmartArt diagram showcase.
Changing the Appearance of Diagram Shapes
To call attention to one part of a diagram, you can change the appearance of 
a shape and make it stand out. Any part of a diagram that is different from 
the other parts naturally gets more attention. To change the appearance 
of a shape, consider changing its size or color, exchanging one shape for 
another, or changing the font and font size of the text. These topics are cov-
ered in the following pages.

140
Changing the Appearance of Diagram Shapes
Changing the size of a diagram shape
A shape that is larger than other shapes in a diagram gets the attention of 
the audience. Select your shape and use one of these techniques to enlarge 
or shrink it:
 
 
✦ On the (SmartArt Tools) Format tab, click the Larger or Smaller button 
as many times as necessary to make the shape the right size.
 
✦ Move the pointer over a corner selection handle, and when the pointer 
changes to a two-headed arrow, click and start dragging.
Notice that the text inside the shape remains the same size although the 
shape is larger. To change the size of the text in a shape, see “Changing fonts 
and font sizes on shapes,” later in this chapter.
To return a diagram shape to its original size after you’ve fooled with it, 
right-click the shape and choose Reset Shape.
Exchanging one shape for another
Another way to call attention to an important part of a diagram is to change 
shapes, as shown in Figure 7-10. Rather than a conventional shape, use an 
oval, block arrow, or star. You can substitute a shape in the Shapes gallery 
for any diagram shape (Book I, Chapter 8 explores the Shapes gallery). To 
exchange one shape for another in a diagram, select the shape and use one 
of these techniques:
 
 
✦ On the (SmartArt Tools) Format tab, click the Change Shape button and 
select a shape in the Shapes gallery.
 
✦ Right-click the shape, choose Change Shape on the shortcut menu, and 
select a shape on the submenu.

Changing a shape’s color, fill, or outline
Yet another way to call attention to a shape is to change its color, fill, or out-
line border, as shown in Figure 7-11. Select a shape and go to the (SmartArt 
Tools) Format tab to change a shape’s color, fill, or outline.

✦ Filling a shape with a new color: Click the Shape Fill button and make a 
choice from the drop-down list to select a color, picture, two-color gradi-
ent, or texture for the shape.
 
 
✦ Changing the outline: Click the Shape Outline button and choose a 
color and weight for the shape’s border on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Applying a shape effect: Click the Shape Effects button to select a shape 
effect for your shape.
Editing 3-D diagrams in 2-D
Three-dimensional diagrams are wonderful. 
You can impress your friends with a 3-D dia-
gram. All you have to do to turn a mundane 
two-dimensional diagram into a three-dimen-
sional showpiece is go to the (SmartArt Tools) 
Design tab, open the SmartArt Styles gallery, 
and select a 3-D option.
Unfortunately, editing a 3-D diagram can be dif-
ficult. The shapes and text are all aslant. It’s 
hard to tell where to click or what to drag when 
you’re editing a 3-D diagram.
Fortunately, you can get around the problem 
of editing a 3-D diagram by temporarily dis-
playing it in two dimensions. On the (SmartArt 
Tools) Format tab, click the Edit in 2-D button to 
temporarily render a 3-D graphic in two dimen-
sions. Click the button a second time to get the 
third dimension back.

Creating a Diagram from Scratch
Changing fonts and font sizes on shapes
To make a diagram shape stand out, try changing the font and font size of 
the text on the shape. Before you change fonts and font sizes, however, 
you should know that changing fonts in a shape effectively disconnects 
the shape from the other shapes in the diagram. Normally, text changes 
size throughout a diagram when you add or remove shapes, but when you 
change the font or font size in one shape, it is no longer associated with the 
other shapes; its letters don’t change their size or appearance when shapes 
are added or removed from the diagram of which it is a part.
To alter the text on a diagram shape, select the text, go to the Home tab, and 
choose a different font, font size, and font color, too, if you want.
Creating a Diagram from Scratch
If you have the skill and the wherewithal, you can create a diagram from 
scratch by piecing together shapes, arrows, and connectors. The diagram 
in Figure 7-12, for example, was made not from SmartArt graphics but from 
shapes, arrows, and connectors. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to draw 
shapes and lines between shapes. You can enter text on any shape merely 
by clicking inside it and wiggling your fingers over the keyboard.
 
Figure 7-12:

Making a diagram from scratch has some advantages. You can draw the con-
nectors any which way. Lines can cross the diagram chaotically. You can 
include text boxes as well as shapes (the diagram in Figure 7-12 has four text 
boxes). Don’t hesitate to fashion your own diagrams when a presentation or 
document calls for it.

hether you know it or not, Office 2010 comes with drawing com-
mands for drawing lines, arrows, shapes, block arrows, stars, ban-
ners, and callout shapes. And Office provides numerous ways to manipulate 
these objects after you draw them. The drawing commands are meant to 
bring out the artist in you. Use them to make diagrams, fashion your own 
ideagrams, and illustrate difficult concepts and ideas. Lines and shapes give 
you a wonderful opportunity to exercise your creativity. A picture is worth a 
thousand words, so they say, and the drawing commands give you a chance 
to express yourself without having to write a thousand words.
In this chapter, you discover all the many ways to manipulate lines, shapes, 
text boxes, WordArt images, clip-art images, and graphics. You discover 
how to lay out these objects on a page or slide, flip them, change their 
colors, resize them, move them, and otherwise torture them until they 
look just right. You discover how to draw lines and arrows, draw connec-
tions between shapes, and draw ovals, squares, other shapes, and WordArt 
images. Use the techniques I describe in this chapter to bring something 
more to your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Publisher publi-
cations, and Excel worksheets: originality. With the techniques I describe in 
this chapter, you can bring the visual element into your work. You can com-
municate with images as well as words and numbers.
The Basics: Drawing Lines, Arrows, and Shapes
Figure 8-1 demonstrates how you can use lines, arrows, and shapes (not 
to mention text boxes) to illustrate ideas and concepts. Sometimes, saying 

144
The Basics: Drawing Lines, Arrows, and Shapes
it with lines and shapes is easier and more informative than saying it with 
words. Even in Excel worksheets, you can find opportunities to use lines, 
arrows, and shapes. For example, draw arrows and lines on worksheets to 
illustrate which cells are used to compute formulas.
Follow these basic steps to draw a line, arrow, or shape:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to draw and see lines and 
shapes. 
 
 2. Click the Shapes button to open the Insert Shapes gallery.
 
 
 As shown in Figure 8-2, the Shapes gallery appears. The shapes are 
divided into several categories, including Lines, Basic Shapes, and Block 
Arrows, as well as a category at the top of the gallery where shapes you 
chose recently are shown. (PowerPoint also offers the Shapes button on 
the Home tab.)
 
3. Select a line, arrow, or shape in the Shapes gallery.
 
4. Drag on your page, slide, or worksheet.
 
 As you drag, the line, arrow, or shape appears before your eyes.
 
5. To alter your line, arrow, or shape — that is, to change its size, color, 
or outline — go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab.
 
 This tab offers many commands for manipulating lines and shapes. 
(Those commands are explained throughout this chapter.) You must 
select a line or shape to make the (Drawing Tools) Format tab appear.

 In the upper-left corner of the (Drawing Tools) Format tab is another 
Shapes gallery for creating new shapes to go along with the one you 
created.
Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
Earlier in this chapter, Figure 8-1 shows examples of how you can use lines 
and arrows to present ideas. As well as lines and arrows, the Insert Shapes 
gallery offers connectors, the special lines that link shapes and can bend and 
stretch as you move shapes around. Use connectors along with lines and 
arrows to describe the relationships between the people or things in a dia-
gram. These pages explain how to handle lines, arrows, and connectors.
Changing the length and position of a line or arrow
To change anything about a line or arrow, start by clicking to select it. You 
can tell when a line has been selected because round selection handles 
appear at either end. Follow these instructions to move a line or adjust its 
length or angle:
 
✦ Changing the angle of a line: Drag a selection handle up, down, or side-
ways. A dotted line shows where your line will be when you release the 
mouse button.
 
✦ Changing the length: Drag a selection handle away from or toward the 
opposite selection handle.

146
Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
 
 
✦ Changing the position: Move the pointer over the line itself and click 
when you see the four-headed arrow. Then drag the line to a new location.
Changing the appearance of 
a line, arrow, or connector
 
 What a line looks like is a matter of its color, its weight (how wide it is), its 
dash status (it can be filled out or dashed), and its cap (its ends can be 
rounded, square, or flat). To change the appearance of a line, start by select-
ing it, going to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, and opening the drop-down 
list on the Shape Outline button (this button is in the Shape Styles group). 
As shown in Figure 8-3, you see a drop-down list with commands for han-
dling the appearance of lines, arrows, and connectors:
 
✦ Color: Select a color on the drop-down list (see Figure 8-3).
 
✦ Width: Choose Weight on the drop-down list (see Figure 8-3) and then 
choose a line width on the submenu. You can also choose More Lines on 
the submenu to open the Format Shape dialog box and change the width 
there. Enter a setting in points to make the line heavier or thinner.
 
✦ Dotted or dashed lines: Choose Dashes on the drop-down list (refer to 
Figure 8-3) and then choose an option on the submenu. Again, you can 
choose More Lines to open the Format Shape dialog box and choose 
from many dash types and compound lines.
 
✦ Line caps: Click the Shape Styles group button to open the Format 
Shape dialog box. In the Line Style category, select a cap type (Square, 
Round, or Flat).
 
You can also change the appearance of a line on the (Drawing Tools) Format 
tab by opening the Shape Styles gallery and selecting a style.

Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
Attaching and handling arrowheads 
on lines and connectors
Arrows, of course, have arrowheads, and arrowheads on lines and connec-
tors can go on either side or both sides of a line. What’s more, arrowheads 
come in different sizes and shapes. To handle arrowheads on lines and con-
nectors, select your line or connector and go to the (Drawing Tools) Format 
tab. Then use one of these techniques to handle the arrowheads:
 
 
✦ Open the drop-down list on the Shape Outline button, choose Arrows 
(refer to Figure 8-3), and select an arrow on the submenu.
 
✦ Click the Shape Styles group button to open the Format Shape dialog 
box. In the Line Style category, choose Arrow settings to describe where 
you want the arrowheads to be, what you want them to look like, and 
what size you want them to be.
 
To attach an arrowhead or arrowheads to a line or connector you’ve already 
drawn, select the line and proceed as though you were attaching arrow-
heads to a line that already has an arrow.
Connecting shapes by using connectors
Under Lines, the Shapes gallery offers six different connectors. Use connec-
tors to link shapes and text boxes to form a diagram. Connectors differ from 
conventional lines in an important way: After you attach one to a shape, it 
stays with the shape when you move the shape. You don’t have to worry 
about remaking all the connections after you move a shape. You can move 
shapes at will and let the connectors between shapes take care of themselves. 
Choosing a default line style for consistency’s sake
One of the secrets to making an attractive 
drawing is to make the lines consistent with 
one another. Lines should be the same width 
and color. They should be the same style. 
Unless you observe this rule, your drawings 
will be infested with lines of varying width and 
different colors. They will look like a confetti 
parade in a windstorm.
You can get around the problem of making 
lines consistent with one another by creating a 
model line and making it the default line style. 
After you declare a default style, all new lines 
you create are assigned the style. You don’t 
have to spend as much time making the lines 
look alike.
Give a line the style, weight, and color that you 
want for all (or at least most) lines and then 
follow these steps to make that line the default 
style:
 1. Select and right-click the line.
 2. Choose Set As Default Line on the shortcut 
menu.

148
Handling Lines, Arrows, and Connectors
Figure 8-4 shows three types of connectors in action. (By the way, if you 
came here to explore how to make a diagram, be sure to check out Book I, 
Chapter 7 as well. It explains the Office SmartArt diagramming.)

To connect shapes in Word, the shapes must be on the drawing canvas. 
Book II, Chapter 4 describes the Word drawing canvas. (Click the Shapes 
button and choose New Drawing Canvas to create one.)
Making the connection
Before you draw the connections, draw the shapes and arrange them on the 
slide where you want them to be in your diagram. Then follow these steps to 
connect two shapes with a connector:
 
1. Select the two shapes that you want to connect.
 
 To select the shapes, hold down the Ctrl key and click each one.
 
2. On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, open the Shapes gallery.
 
3. Under Lines, select the connector that will best fit between the two 
shapes you want to link together.
 
4. Move the pointer over a side selection handle on one of the shapes 
you want to connect.
 
 The selection handles turn red.
 
5. Click and drag the pointer over a selection handle on the other shape, 
and when you see red selection handles on that shape, release the 
mouse button.
 
 Red, round selection handles appear on the shapes where they’re con-
nected. These red handles tell you that the two shapes are connected 
and will remain connected when you move them.

Handling Rectangles, Ovals, Stars, and Other Shapes
 
If your connector is attached to the wrong shape, don’t despair. Select the 
connector, and on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Edit Shape 
button and choose Reroute Connectors. Then move the pointer over the red 
handle on the side of the connector that needs to be attached elsewhere, 
click, drag the connector elsewhere on the other shape, and release the 
mouse button when you see the red selection handles.
Adjusting a connector
Chances are, your connector needs adjusting to make it fit correctly between 
the two shapes. Click to select your connector and follow these techniques 
to adjust it:
 
✦ Changing the shape of a connector: Drag the yellow diamond on the 
connector. As you drag, the connector assumes different shapes.
 
✦ Changing the connector type: Right-click the connector, choose 
Connector Types, and choose Straight Connector, Elbow Connector, or 
Curved Connector on the submenu.
 
✦ Handling arrows on connectors: If the arrows on the connector aren’t 
there, are pointing in the wrong direction, or shouldn’t be there, change 
the arrowheads around using the same techniques you use with stan-
dard arrows. See “Attaching and handling arrowheads on lines and con-
nectors,” earlier in this chapter.
 
Make sure that the connector lines in your diagram are consistent with one 
another. Give them the same style and appearance, or else it will be hard to 
make sense of your diagram.
Handling Rectangles, Ovals, Stars, and Other Shapes
Figure 8-5 illustrates how shapes can come in very handy for illustrating con-
cepts and ideas. You can combine shapes to make your own illustrations. 
Apart from the standard rectangle and oval, you can draw octagons and vari-
ous other “-agons,” arrows, stars, and banners. You are hereby encouraged 
to make shapes a part of your work, and you’ll be glad to know that drawing 
shapes is not difficult. These pages explain how to draw a shape, exchange 
one shape for another, change a shape’s symmetry, and enter words on a 
shape.
 
In Word, you must be in Print Layout view to draw and handle shapes. If you 
intend to draw more than one shape in Word, create a drawing canvas to 
hold the shapes (click the Shapes button and choose New Drawing Canvas). 
Book II, Chapter 4 describes the drawing canvas in Word.

Drawing a shape
Follow these steps to draw a shape:
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the Shapes button to open the Shapes gallery.
 
 
 You can also insert shapes from the Shapes gallery on the (Drawing 
Tools) Format tab.
 
2. Select a shape in the gallery.
 
 If you’ve drawn the shape recently, you may be able to find it at the top 
of the gallery under Recently Used Shapes.
 
3. Click and drag slantwise to draw the shape, as shown at the top of 
Figure 8-6.
 
 Hold down the Shift key as you drag if you want the shape to retain its 
proportions. For example, to draw a circle, select the Oval shape and 
hold down the Shift key as you draw.
Changing a shape’s size and shape
Selection handles appear on the corners and sides of a shape after you 
select it. With the selection handles showing, you can change a shape’s size 
and shape:
 
✦ Hold down the Shift key and drag a corner handle to change a shape’s 
size and retain its symmetry.
 
✦ Drag a side, top, or bottom handle to stretch or scrunch a shape. 
Choosing a different shape
To exchange one shape for another, select the shape and follow these steps:
 
 1. On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Edit Shape button.
 
 
 You can find this button in the Insert Shapes group.
 
2. Choose Change Shape on the drop-down list.
 
3. Select a new shape in the Shapes gallery.

Changing a shape’s symmetry
A yellow diamond, sometimes more than one, appears on some shapes. By 
dragging a diamond, you can change a shape’s symmetry. Figure 8-6, for 
example, shows the same shape — the Sun shape — altered to show dif-
ferent symmetries. Notice where the diamonds are. By dragging a diamond 
even a short distance, you can do a lot to change a shape’s symmetry.
Using a shape as a text box
Here’s a neat trick: Rather than use the conventional rectangle as a text box, 
you can use a shape. Figure 8-7 shows examples of shapes being used as text 
boxes. By placing words on shapes, you can make the shapes illustrate ideas 
and concepts.
Follow these instructions to handle text box shapes:
 
✦ Entering the text: Click in the shape and start typing. In Word, you can 
right-click and choose Add Text if you have trouble typing in the shape.
 
✦ Editing the text: Click in the text and start editing. That’s all there is to 
it. If you have trouble getting inside the shape to edit the text, select the 
shape, right-click it, and choose Edit Text on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Changing the font, color, and size of text: Right-click in the text and 
choose Font. Then, in the Font dialog box, choose a font, font color, and 
a font size for the text.

✦ Allowing the shape to enlarge for text: You can allow the shape to 
enlarge and receive more text. Click the Shape Styles group button, 
and in the Text Box category of the Format Shape dialog box, select the 
Resize Shape to Fit Text option button.

WordArt for Bending, Spindling, and Mutilating Text
A WordArt image consists of a word that has been stretched, crumpled, or 
squeezed into an odd shape. Actually, a WordArt image can include more 
than one word. Figure 8-8 shows the WordArt gallery, where WordArt images 
are made, and an example of a WordArt image. After you insert a WordArt 
image, you can fool with the buttons on the WordArt toolbar and torture the 
word or phrase even further.

Creating a WordArt image
Follow these steps to create a WordArt image:
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the WordArt button.
 
 
 A drop-down list with WordArt styles appears.
 
2. Select a WordArt style.
 
 Don’t worry about selecting the right style; you can choose a different 
one later on.
 
3. Enter the text for the image in the WordArt text box.
 
 Congratulations. You just created a WordArt image.
Editing a WordArt image
Usually, you have to wrestle with a WordArt image before it comes out right. 
Select the image, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, and use these tech-
niques to win the wrestling match:
 
✦ Editing the words: Click in the WordArt text box and edit the text there.
 
✦ Choosing a new WordArt style: Open the WordArt Styles gallery and 
select a style. Depending on the size of your screen and which program 
you’re working in, you may have to click the Quick Styles button first 
(refer to Figure 8-8).
 
 
✦ Changing the letters’ color: Click the Text Fill button and choose a color 
on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Changing the letters’ outline: Click the Text Outline button and make 
choices to change the letters’ outline.
Turning a text box into a text box shape
To turn a conventional text box into a text box 
shape, follow these instructions:
 1. Select the text box by clicking its 
perimeter.
 2. On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click 
the Edit Shape button, choose Change 
Shape, and then select a shape in the 
Shapes gallery.
After the conversion, you usually have to 
enlarge the shape to accommodate the text.

Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
To apply color or an outline to some of the letters or words in a WordArt 
image, select the letters or words before choosing options on the (Drawing 
Tools) Format tab.
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, 
Text Boxes, and Other Objects
After you insert a shape, line, text box, clip-art image, graphic, diagram, 
WordArt image, chart, or embedded object in a file, it ceases being what it 
was before and becomes an object. Figure 8-9 shows eight objects. I’m not 
sure whether these eight objects resent being objectified, but Office objecti-
fies them. As far as manipulating these items in Office is concerned, these 
are just objects.
 
Figure 8-9: 
Examples of 
objects.
 
The techniques for manipulating objects are the same whether you’re deal-
ing with a line, shape, graphic, clip-art image, diagram, or text box. The good 
news from your end is that you have to master only one set of techniques 
for handling these objects. Whether you want to move, change the size of, or 
change the outline of a text box, clip-art image, graphic, or shape, the tech-
niques are the same.
In the remainder of this chapter are instructions for doing these tasks with 
objects:
 
✦ Selecting: Before you can do anything to objects, you have to select 
them. See “Selecting objects so that you can manipulate them,” later in 
this chapter.
 
✦ Making use of the rulers and grid: Rulers (in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, 
and Publisher) and the grid (in Word and PowerPoint) can be very help-
ful for aligning and placing objects. See “Hiding and displaying the rulers 
and grid.”

Book I

Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
✦ Changing an object’s size and shape: You can enlarge, shrink, stretch, 
and scrunch objects to make them wider or taller. See “Changing an 
object’s size and shape.”
 
✦ Moving and positioning: You can land objects with precision in a Word 
document, PowerPoint slide, or Excel worksheet. See “Moving and posi-
tioning objects.”
 
✦ Aligning and distributing: Another way to move and position objects 
is to realign or redistribute them across a page, slide, or worksheet. See 
“Tricks for aligning and distributing objects.”
 
✦ Overlapping: When you’re dealing with several objects, they’re bound 
to overlap — and sometimes overlapping objects make for an interesting 
effect. On the right side of Figure 8-9, for example, several objects over-
lap and give the impression that they were “dropped there.” See “When 
objects overlap: Choosing which appears above the other,” to handle 
overlapping objects.
 
✦ Rotating and flipping: Viewers turn their heads when they see an object 
that has been flipped or rotated. You can rotate and flip shapes, lines, 
text boxes, graphics, clip-art images, and WordArt images. See “Rotating 
and flipping objects.”
 
✦ Grouping: To make working with several different objects easier, you 
can group them so that they become a single object. After objects have 
been grouped, manipulating them — manipulating it, I should say — is 
easier. See “Grouping objects to make working with them easier.”
 
✦ Applying outlines and fills: Putting outlines and color fills on objects 
makes them stand out. You can also fill some kinds of objects with a 
color or pattern. See “Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and 
Transparency.”
If you sighed after you finished reading this long list, I don’t blame you. But 
be of good cheer: Most of these commands are easy to pick up, and includ-
ing lines, shapes, text boxes, WordArt images, clip art, and graphics in your 
work is a good way to impress your friends and intimidate your enemies.
Selecting objects so that you can manipulate them
Before you can move or change the border of a graphic, text box, or other 
object, you have to select it. To select an object, simply click it. Sometimes, 
to align or decorate several objects simultaneously, you have to select more 
than one object at the same time. To select more than one object:
 
✦ Ctrl+click them. In other words, hold down the Ctrl key as you click the 
objects.
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Select button and choose Select Objects on 
the drop-down list. (You may have to click the Find & Select button first, 
depending on the size of your screen.) Then click on one side of the 

156
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
objects you want to select and drag the pointer across the other objects. 
In Word, the objects must be on the drawing canvas for you to select 
them this way. (Book II, Chapter 4 describes the Word drawing canvas.)
 
 
✦ On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Selection Pane button. The 
Selection and Visibility pane opens, as shown in Figure 8-10. It lists 
objects on the drawing canvas (Word), slide (PowerPoint), or worksheet 
(Excel). Click or Ctrl+click object names in the pane to select objects.
 
 You can also open the Selection and Visibility pane by clicking the Select 
button on the Home tab and choosing Selection Pane on the drop-down 
list. (You may have to click the Editing button first, depending on the 
size of your screen.)
 
Figure 8-10: 
Click an 
object in the 
Selection 
and Visibility 
pane to 
select it.
 
 
After you select an object, its selection handles appear. Objects have eight 
selection handles, one at each corner and one at each side. To tell whether 
an object is selected, look for its selection handles.
Hiding and displaying the rulers and grid
Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher offer two rulers, one along the top of 
the window and one along the left side. Use the rulers to help place and align 
objects. To display or hide these rulers, use one of these techniques:
 
✦ On the View tab, click the Ruler check box. (You may have to click the 
Show/Hide button first, depending on the size of your screen.) To see 
the rulers, you must be in Print Layout view In Word and Page Layout 
view in Excel.

Book I
Chapter 8
Drawing Lines, 
Shapes, and 
Other Objects
157
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
✦ In PowerPoint, you can also hide or display rulers by right-clicking a 
slide (but not an object or frame) and choosing Ruler on the shortcut 
menu.
In Word and PowerPoint, the grid can come in very handy for aligning 
objects. On the View tab, click the Gridlines check box to see the grid. 
(You may have to click the Show/Hide button first.) The grid settings in 
PowerPoint are quite sophisticated (see Book IV, Chapter 4 for details).
 
By the way, fans of the metric system will be pleased to know that you can 
display centimeters (or millimeters, points, or picas) rather than inches on 
the ruler. On the File tab, choose Options. In the Options dialog box, go to 
the Advanced category, open the Show Measurements in Units Of drop-down 
list, and choose a unit of measurement.
Changing an object’s size and shape
Usually when an object arrives on-screen, you have to wrestle with it. You 
have to change its size (and sometimes its shape as well). Figure 8-11 dem-
onstrates how to resize an object. Select your object and use one of these 
methods to change its size and shape:
 
✦ “Eyeball it”: Hold down the Shift key and drag a corner selection handle 
to make the object larger or smaller but maintain its proportions. Drag a 
selection handle on the side to stretch or crimp an object and change its 
shape as well as its size.
 
✦ Enter height and width measurements: On the Format tab, enter mea-
surements in the Height and Width boxes (see Figure 8-11). Depending 
on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Size button before 
you can see these boxes.
 
✦ Open the Format (or Layout) dialog box: Click the Size group button on 
the Format tab to open the Format dialog box (in PowerPoint and Excel) 
or the Layout dialog box (in Word). Then change the Height and Width 
settings in the dialog box (refer to Figure 8-11).
 
Whether you can change an object’s shape as well as its size depends on 
whether the object’s aspect ratio is locked. If you’re wrestling with an object 
and it won’t do your bidding — if it refuses to change shape or it changes 
shape, and you don’t want it to do that — unlock its aspect ratio setting. 
Click the Size group button, and in the dialog box that appears, select or 
deselect the Lock Aspect Ratio check box. When an object’s aspect ratio is 
locked, it maintains its shape as you change its size, but when it’s unlocked, 
you can change its shape as well as its size.
 
You can change the size and shape of several objects at one time by select-
ing all the objects before giving a command to change sizes. Being able to 
change objects’ size this way is convenient when you want to change the 
size of many objects but maintain their relationships to one another.

Moving and positioning objects
Moving objects is considerably easier than moving furniture. Select the 
object you want to reposition and use one of these techniques to land it in 
the right place:
 
 
✦ Dragging: Move the pointer over the perimeter of the object, click when 
you see the four-headed arrow, and drag the object to a new location. 
Hold down the Shift key as you drag to move an object either horizon-
tally or vertically in a straight line.
 
✦ Using a dialog box (in PowerPoint and Word): On the Format tab, click 
the Size group button. (Depending on the size of your screen, you may 
have to click the Size button first.) You see the Format or Layout dialog 
box. On the Position category or tab, enter Horizontal and Vertical posi-
tion measurements to place the object on the slide or page.
 
✦ Nudging: If you can’t quite fit an object in the right place, try using a 
Nudge command. Nudge commands move objects up, down, left, or 
right. Press one of the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the object a little 
bit. Hold down the Ctrl key as you press an arrow key to make the object 
move by tiny increments.
 
Use the dialog box method of positioning objects when you want objects to 
be in the exact same position on different pages or slides.

Tricks for aligning and distributing objects
When several objects appear in the same place, use the Align and Distribute 
commands to give the objects an orderly appearance. You can make your 
Word page, PowerPoint slide, Excel worksheet, or Publisher publication 
look tidier by aligning the objects or by distributing them so that they are an 
equal distance from one another. Office offers special commands for doing 
these tasks.
Aligning objects
The Align commands come in handy when you want objects to line up with 
one another. Suppose you need to align several shapes. As shown in Figure 
8-12, you can use an Align command to line up the shapes with precision. 
You don’t have to tug and pull, tug and pull until the shapes are aligned 
with one another. In the figure, I used the Align Top command to line up 
the shapes along the top. In Word and PowerPoint, besides aligning objects 
with respect to one another, you can align objects with respect to the page 
(in Word) or the slide (in PowerPoint). For example, you can line up objects 
along the top of a slide.
 
Figure 8-12: 
Use the 
Align 
commands 
to align 
objects. 
These 
objects are 
aligned 
along the 
top.
 
Follow these steps to line up objects:
 
1. Move the objects to where, roughly, you want them to be, and if you 
want to align objects with respect to one another, move one object to 
a point that the others will align to.
 
 When Office aligns objects with respect to one another, it aligns them to 
the object in the leftmost, centermost, rightmost, topmost, middlemost, 
or bottommost position, depending on which Align command you choose.

160
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
2. Select the objects you want to align.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting objects so that you can manipulate 
them” looks at selection techniques.
 
3. Go to the Format tab.
 
 You can also click the Page Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Home 
tab (in PowerPoint).
 
 4. Click the Align button, and on the drop-down list, choose whether to 
align the objects with respect to one another or with respect to the 
page or page margin (in Word) or a slide (in PowerPoint).
 
 Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Arrange 
button to get to the Align button.
 
5. Click the Align button again and choose an Align command — Left, 
Center, Right, Top, Middle, or Bottom (refer to Figure 8-12).
 
6. If necessary, drag the objects on the page.
 
 That’s right — drag them. After you give an Align command, the objects 
are still selected, and you can drag to adjust their positions.
Distributing objects so that they are equidistant
The Distribute commands — Distribute Horizontally and Distribute 
Vertically — come in handy for laying out objects on a page or slide. These 
commands arrange objects so that the same amount of space appears 
between each one. Rather than go to the trouble of pushing and pulling 
objects until they are distributed evenly, you can simply select the objects 
and choose a Distribute command.
Figure 8-13 demonstrates how the Distribute commands work. In the figure, 
I chose the Distribute Horizontally command so that the same amount of 
horizontal (side-by-side) space appears between the objects. Distributing 
objects such as these on your own, perhaps by entering measurements 
in the Layout or Format dialog box, is a waste of time when you can use a 
Distribute command.
Follow these steps to distribute objects horizontally or vertically on a page 
or slide:
 
1. Arrange the objects so that the outermost objects — the ones that will 
go on the top and bottom or left side and right side — are where you 
want them to be.
 
 In other words, if you want to distribute objects horizontally across a 
page, place the leftmost object and rightmost object where you want 
them to be. Office will distribute the other objects equally between the 
leftmost and rightmost object.

2. Select the objects.
 
3. Go to the Format tab.
 
 You can also go to the Page Layout tab (in Word and Excel) or the Home 
tab (in PowerPoint).
 
 4. Click the Align button and choose a Distribute option on the drop-
down list.
 
 To find the Align button, you may have to click the Arrange button first, 
depending on the size of your screen.

When objects overlap: Choosing 
which appears above the other
On a page or slide that is crowded with text boxes, shapes, graphics, and 
clip-art images, objects inevitably overlap, and you have to decide which 
object goes on top of the stack and which on the bottom. In a Word docu-
ment, you have to decide as well whether text appears above or below 
objects.
Objects that deliberately overlap can be interesting and attractive to look 
at. On the right side of Figure 8-14, for example, a clip-art image and text box 
appear in front of a shape. Makes for a nice effect, no? These pages explain 
controlling how objects overlap with the Bring and Send commands and the 
Selection and Visibility pane.

162
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
Figure 8-14: 
An example 
of objects 
overlapping.
 
Select an object
Choose a Bring or Send command
Controlling overlaps with the Bring and Send commands
Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher offer these commands for handling 
objects in a stack:
 
✦ Bring Forward: Moves the object higher in the stack
 
✦ Bring to Front: Moves the object in front of all other objects in the stack
 
✦ Send Backward: Moves the object lower in the stack
 
✦ Send to Back: Moves the object behind all other objects
Word offers these additional commands:
 
✦ Bring in Front of Text: Moves the object in front of text on the page
 
✦ Send Behind Text: Moves the object behind text on the page so that the 
text appears over the object
Select an object and use one of these techniques to give a Bring or Send 
command:
 
 
✦ On the Format tab, click the Bring Forward or Send Backward button, or 
open the drop-down list on one of these buttons and choose a Bring or 
Send command (refer to Figure 8-14). Depending on the size of your 
screen, you may have to click the Arrange button before you can get to a 
Bring or Send command.

Book I
Chapter 8
Drawing Lines, 
Shapes, and 
Other Objects
163
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
 In Word, Excel, and Publisher, the Bring and Send commands are also 
available on the Page Layout tab; in PowerPoint, they are also available 
on the Home tab, although you may have to click the Arrange button 
first, depending on the size of your screen.
 
✦ Right-click an object and choose a Bring or Send command on the short-
cut menu.
 
In Word, you can’t choose a Bring or Send command unless you’ve chosen 
a text-wrapping option apart from In Line with Text for the object. Select 
your object, go to the Format tab, click the Text Wrap button, and choose an 
option on the drop-down list apart from In Line with Text. Book II, Chapter 4 
looks at text wrapping in Word.
 
If an object on the bottom of the stack shows through after you place it on 
the bottom, the object on the top of the stack is transparent or semi-trans-
parent. Transparent objects are like gauze curtains — they reveal what’s 
behind them. If you want to make the object on the top of the stack less 
transparent, see “Making a color transparent,” later in this chapter.
Controlling overlaps with the Selection and Visibility pane
Another way to control how objects overlap is to open the Selection and 
Visibility pane, select an object, and click the Bring Forward or Send 
Backward button as necessary to move the object up or down in the stack. 
The Bring Forward and Send Backward buttons are located at the bottom of 
the pane. Earlier in this chapter, “Selecting objects so that you can manipu-
late them” explains the Selection and Visibility pane. (On the Format tab, 
click the Selection Pane button to open it.)
Rotating and flipping objects
Rotating and flipping objects — that is, changing their orientation — is a 
neat way to spruce up a page or slide, as Figure 8-15 demonstrates. You 
can rotate and flip these kinds of objects: lines, shapes, text boxes, clip-art 
images, graphics, and WordArt images. To flip or rotate an object, select it 
and do one of the following:
 
 
✦ Choose a Rotate or Flip command: On the Format tab, click the Rotate 
button and choose an option on the drop-down list (refer to Figure 8-15). 
The Rotate commands rotate objects by 90 degrees; the Flip commands 
flip objects over. The Rotate button is also found on the Page Layout tab 
(in Word and Excel) and the Home tab (in PowerPoint and Publisher). 
You may have to click the Arrange button to see the Rotate button, 
depending on the size of your screen.
 
✦ Roll your own: Drag the object’s rotation handle, the green dot that 
appears after you select it. Hold down the Shift key as you drag to rotate 
the shape by 15-degree increments.

164
Manipulating Lines, Shapes, Art, Text Boxes, and Other Objects
 
✦ Open the Format or Layout dialog box: On the Rotate drop-down list, 
choose More Rotation Options to open the Format or Layout dialog box. 
Enter a degree measurement in the Rotation text box.
 
Figure 8-15:

or choose a Rotate or Flip command
 
To rotate several objects simultaneously, Ctrl+click to select each object and 
then give a rotation command.
Grouping objects to make working with them easier
Consider the clip-art image, shape, and text box in Figure 8-16. To move, 
resize, or reshape these objects, I would have to laboriously move them one at 
a time — that is, I would have to do that if it weren’t for the Group command.
The Group command assembles different objects into a single object to 
make moving, resizing, and reshaping objects easier. With the Group com-
mand, you select the objects that you want to “group” and then you wrap 
them into a bundle so that they become easier to work with. Office remem-
bers which objects were grouped so that you can ungroup objects after 
you’ve moved or resized them.

Grouping objects
Select the objects and do one of the following to group them into one happy 
family:
 
 
✦ On the Format tab (or the Page Layout tab in Word and Excel, and the 
Home tab in PowerPoint and Publisher), click the Group button and choose 
Group on the drop-down list. Depending on the size of your screen, you 
may have to click the Arrange button to get to the Group button.
 
✦ Right-click one of the objects you selected and choose Group➪Group.
After objects are grouped, they form a single object with the eight selection 
handles.
 
To add an object to a group, select the object and the grouped objects by 
Ctrl+clicking and then choose the Group command.
Ungrouping and regrouping
 
 To ungroup an object and break it into its components parts, perhaps to 
fiddle with one of the objects in the group, select the object, go to the 
Format tab, click the Group button, and choose Ungroup.
Office remembers which objects were in a group after you ungroup it. To 
reassemble the objects in a group, click an object that was formerly in the 
group and then choose the Regroup command. You can find this command 
on the Group button, and you can also give the Regroup command by right-
clicking and choosing Group➪Regroup.

Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and Transparency
Changing an Object’s Color, Outline 
Color, and Transparency
If an object’s color or outline color doesn’t suit you, you have the right to 
change colors. For that matter, you can opt for a “blank” object with no 
color or remove the color from around the perimeter of the object. As the 
saying goes, “It’s a free country.”
Office has its own lingo when it comes to an object’s color. Remember these 
terms when you make like Picasso with your shapes, text boxes, graphics, 
and clip-art images:
 
 
✦ Shape fill colors: The color that fills in an object is called the shape fill. 
You can apply shape fills to shapes, text boxes, and WordArt images, 
but not clip art or graphics. Besides colors, you can fill a shape with a 
picture, a gradient, or a texture. (See the next topic in this chapter, 
“Filling an object with a color, picture, or texture.”)
 
 
✦ Shape outline colors: The line that goes around the perimeter of the 
object is called the shape outline. You can choose a color, style, and line 
width for outlines. (See “Putting the outline around an object,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
The easiest way to decorate a shape, text box, or WordArt image is to visit 
the Format tab and make a selection in the Shape Styles gallery. These 
ready-made gallery selections can spare you the work of dealing with fill 
colors, outlines, and shape effects. Just remember not to mix and match dif-
ferent Shape Style options; use them with consistency.
Filling an object with a color, picture, or texture
Shapes, text boxes, and WordArt images are empty when you first create 
them, but you can fill them with a color, picture, gradient, or texture by fol-
lowing these basic steps:
 
1. Select the object that needs a facelift.
 
 2. On the Format tab, click the Shape Fill button.
 
 3. On the drop-down list, choose a fill color, picture, gradient, or texture.
 
 Choose No Fill to remove the fill color, picture, gradient, or texture from 
an object.
Figure 8-17 shows the same object filled with a color, picture, gradient, and 
texture. Which do you prefer? Your choices are as follows:
 
✦ Color: Applies a single color to the object.

Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and Transparency
 
✦ Picture: Places a picture in the object. You see the Insert Picture dialog 
box. Choose a picture and click the Insert button.
 
✦ Gradient (Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher only): Applies gradient color 
shading to the object. You can choose between various shading styles.
 
✦ Texture: Offers 24 patterns meant to simulate various surfaces. The 
choices include Granite, Paper Bag, and Pink Tissue Paper. Be sure to 
use the scroll bar to see all the choices.
 
✦ Pattern (Publisher only): Applies a pattern to the object. Select a pat-
tern on the Pattern tab of the Fill Effects dialog box.

(from left to 
right): color,

Making a color transparent
 
A transparent color is like gauze because instead of being solid, it shows 
what’s behind it. Transparent colors are especially useful in text boxes 
because the text shows through and can be read easily. Follow these steps 
to make the fill color in a text box, shape, or WordArt image transparent or 
semitransparent:
 
1. Right-click the object and choose Format Shape (or Format AutoShape).
 
 You see the Format Shape dialog box.
 
2. In the Fill category, drag the Transparency slider to choose how trans-
parent a color you want.
 
 At 100%, the color is completely transparent and, in fact, not there; at 
1%, the color is hardly transparent at all.
 
3. Click the Close or OK button.
You can also make a graphic transparent by recoloring it. See Book VIII, 
Chapter 3.

168
Changing an Object’s Color, Outline Color, and Transparency
Putting the outline around an object
The outline is the line that runs around the perimeter of an object. Put an 
outline color around an object to give it more definition or make it stand out. 
Figure 8-18 shows examples of outlines. What a shape outline looks like has 
to do with the color, weight, and dash style you choose for it.
 
Figure 8-18: 
An object’s 
outline has 
to do with 
its color, 
weight, and 
dash style.
 
Select your object and follow these steps to change its outline:
 
 1. On the Format tab, click the Shape Outline button.
 
 A drop-down list appears.
Designating a fill and outline 
color for all your objects
Instead of going to the significant trouble of 
giving all or most of your objects the same 
look, you can make one object the model for all 
others to follow and declare it the default style. 
After that, all new objects you insert appear 
in the same style, your objects have a uniform 
appearance, and you don’t have to spend as 
much time formatting objects.
Select an object with a fill and an outline color 
that you want as your model, right-click the 
object, and choose Set As Default to make 
your object the default that all other objects 
start from.

2. Choose a color, weight, or dash.
 
 You may have to return to the Shape Outline drop-down list more than 
once to make the outline just so.
 
• Color: Choose a theme color deemed right for borders by the makers 
of your program or choose a standard color.
 
• Weight: Choose how thick or thin you want the border to be. You can 
choose More Lines on the submenu to open the Format dialog box. In 
the Line Style category, you can choose compound lines and select 
point-size width for the outline.
 
• Dashes: Choose straight lines, dashed lines, or broken lines.
 
 The (Picture Tools) Format tab — the one you see when you’re dealing 
with pictures and clip art — offers the Picture Border drop-down list 
instead of the Shape Outline drop-down list, but the options on the lists 
are the same.
To remove an outline from an object, choose No Outline on the Shape 
Outline (or Picture Border) drop-down list.

T
his chapter explains shortcuts and commands that can help you 
become a speedy user of Word 2010. Everything in this chapter was 
put here so that you can get off work earlier and take the slow, scenic route 
home. Starting here, you discover how to create and change your view of 
documents. You find out how to select text, get from place to place, and 
mark your place in long documents. You also explore how to insert one 
document into another and create data-entry forms to make entering infor-
mation a little easier.
Introducing the Word Screen
Seeing the Word screen for the first time is like trying to find your way 
through Tokyo’s busy Ikebukuro subway station. It’s intimidating. But when 
you start using Word, you quickly find out what everything is. To help you 
get going, Figure 1-1 shows you the different parts of the screen. Here are 
shorthand descriptions of these screen parts:
 
 
✦ Word button: In the upper-left corner of the screen, the Word button 
offers a menu for restoring, moving, sizing, minimizing, maximizing, and 
closing the Word window.
 
✦ Quick Access toolbar: This toolbar offers the Save, Undo, and Repeat 
buttons. Wherever you go in Word, you see the Quick Access toolbar. 
Book I, Chapter 1 explains the toolbar in detail; Book VIII, Chapter 1 
explains how to customize and move the Quick Access toolbar.

174
Introducing the Word Screen
 
✦ Title bar: At the top of the screen, the title bar tells you the name of the 
document you’re working on.
 
✦ Minimize, Restore, Close buttons: These three magic buttons make it 
very easy to shrink, enlarge, and close the window you are working in.
 
 
✦ File tab: Go to the File tab to do file-management tasks.
 
✦ The Ribbon: Select a tab on the Ribbon to undertake a new task. (Book 
I, Chapter 1 explains the Ribbon in detail, and Book VIII, Chapter 1 
explains how to customize the Ribbon.)
 
✦ Scroll bars: The scroll bars help you get from place to place in a document.
 
✦ Status bar: The status bar gives you basic information about where you 
are and what you’re doing in a document. It tells you what page and 
what section you’re in, the total number of pages and words in your 
document, and what language the text is written in. Book VIII, Chapter 1 
explains how to customize the status bar.
 
✦ View buttons: Click one of these buttons — Print Layout, Full Screen 
Reading, Web Layout, Outline, or Draft — to change your view of a 
document.
 
✦ Zoom controls: Use these controls to zoom in and out on your work.

Creating a New Document
Creating a New Document
Document is just a fancy word for a letter, report, announcement, or procla-
mation that you create with Word. When you first start Word, you see a new, 
blank document with the generic name Document1. You can start working 
right away on this document, or you can create a new document by choos-
ing a template.
A template is a special kind of file that is used as the starting point for creat-
ing documents. Each template comes with many preformatted styles. If your 
aim is to create an academic report, flyer, newsletter, calendar, résumé, or 
other sophisticated document, see if you can spare yourself the formatting 
work by choosing the appropriate template when you create your docu-
ment. (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains templates in detail and how to 
create your own templates.)
 
 No matter what kind of document you want, start creating it by going to the 
File tab and choosing New. The Available Templates window shown in Figure 
1-2 appears. This window offers templates for creating many types of docu-
ments. Click a template in this window to see, on the right side of the 
window, a preview of the document you will create. Double-click a template 
(or select it and click the Create button) to create a document.

176
Creating a New Document
Use these techniques in the Available Templates window to create a document:
 
✦ Create a blank document. Choose the Blank Document icon to create 
a bare-bones document with few styles. Blank Document is the default 
template for creating documents. (By pressing Ctrl+N, you can create a 
new, blank document without opening the Available Templates window.)
 
✦ Create a brochure, form, invoice, or other specialty document. Take 
your pick of these techniques to create a specialty document:
 
• Use a template on your computer. Choose Sample Templates. 
Templates that you loaded on your computer when you installed 
Office appear in the window.
 
• Download a template from Microsoft. Under Office.com Templates, do 
one of the following: (1) choose the type of template you want, or (2) 
make sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, enter a 
search term in the Search box, and click the Start Searching button 
(or press Enter). Choose a template and click the Download button 
to download it to your computer.
 
• Use a template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft or 
acquired from a third party). Click the My Templates icon. The New 
dialog box appears so that you can choose a template. 
 
✦ Create a document from a template you recently used. Click the Recent 
Templates icon and choose a template.
 
✦ Create a document from another document. If you can use another doc-
ument as the starting point for creating a new document, click the New 
from Existing icon. In the New from Existing Document dialog box, select 
the document and click the Create New button.
Constructing your blank default document
When you open a new, blank document 
by pressing Ctrl+N or choosing the Blank 
Document icon in the Available Templates 
window (refer to Figure 1-2), does the docu-
ment meet your specifications? When you start 
typing, does the text appear in your favorite 
font? Are the margins just-so?
You can get a head start on creating docu-
ments by telling Word what you want new, 
blank documents to look like. To do that, open 
the Font dialog box (click the Font group button 
on the Home tab) followed by the Page Setup 
dialog box (click the Page Setup group button 
on the Page Layout tab), make your formatting 
choices in each dialog box, and click the Set As 
Default button. Changes you make this way are 
saved to the Blank Document template, the one 
used to create blank documents. (Chapter 3 of 
this mini-book explains what templates are).

Getting a Better Look at Your Documents
 
If your search for the perfect template takes you too far afield, you can click 
the Home, Back, or Forward button in the Available Templates window to 
backtrack.
Book I, Chapter 1 explains how to save documents after you create them, as 
well as how to open the document you want to work on.
Getting a Better Look at Your Documents
A computer screen can be kind of confining. There you are, staring at the 
darn thing for hours at a stretch. Do you wish the view were better? The 
Word screen can’t be made to look like the Riviera, but you can examine 
documents in different ways and work in two places at one time in the same 
document. Better read on.
Viewing documents in different ways
In word processing, you want to focus sometimes on the writing, sometimes 
on the layout, and sometimes on the organization of your work. To help you 
stay in focus, Word offers different ways of viewing a document. Figure 1-3 
shows these views. These pages explain how to change views, the five dif-
ferent views, and why to select one over the other. (Be sure to visit Book I, 
Chapter 3 as well; it describes how to view a document through more than 
one window and how to open a second window on a document.)
Changing views
Use these techniques to change views: 
 
✦ Click one of the five View buttons on the right side of the status bar.
 
✦ On the View tab, click one of the five buttons in the Document Views group.
Print Layout view
 
 Switch to Print Layout view to see the big picture. In this view, you can see 
what your document will look like when you print it. You can see graphics, 
headers, footers, and even page borders in Print Layout view. You can also 
see clearly where page breaks occur (where one page ends and the next 
begins). In Print Layout view, you can click the One Page, Two Pages, or Page 
Width button on the View tab to display more or fewer pages on your screen.
Full Screen Reading view
 
 Switch to Full Screen Reading view to focus on the text itself and proofread 
your documents. In this view, everything gets stripped away — the Ribbon, 
scroll bars, status bar, and all. All you see is the text and artwork in your 
documents. You can’t enter or edit text (unless you open the View Options 
menu and choose Allow Typing).

179
Getting a Better Look at Your Documents
Click the View Options button to open a menu with options for improving 
your view. For example, you can increase or decrease the size of text, show 
one or two document pages at a time, and display page margins. To get from 
page to page, click buttons along the top of the window. Click the Close 
button to leave this view.
Web Layout view
 
 Switch to Web Layout view to see what your document would look like as a 
Web page. Background colors appear (if you chose a theme or background 
color for your document). Text is wrapped to the window rather than 
around the artwork in the document. Book VIII, Chapter 2 explains how to 
save an Office file, a Word document included, as a Web page.
Outline view
 
 Switch to Outline view to see how your work is organized. In this view, you 
can see only the headings in a document. You can get a sense of how your 
document unfolds and easily move sections of text backward and forward in 
a document. In other words, you can reorganize a document in Outline view. 
Chapter 6 of this mini-book explains outlines in torturous detail.
Draft view
 
 Switch to Draft view when you’re writing a document and you want to focus 
on the words. Clip-art images, shapes, and other objects don’t appear in this 
view, nor do page breaks (although you can clearly see section breaks). 
Draft view is best for writing first drafts.
Splitting the screen
Besides opening a second window on a document (a subject of Book I, 
Chapter 3), you can be two places at one time in a Word document by splitting 
the screen. One reason you might do this: You are writing a long report and 
want the introduction to support the conclusion, and you also want the con-
clusion to fulfill all promises made by the introduction. That’s difficult to do 
sometimes, but you can make it easier by splitting the screen so that you can 
be two places at one time as you write your introduction and conclusion.
Splitting a window means to divide it into north and south halves, as shown 
in Figure 1-4. In a split screen, two sets of scroll bars appear so that you can 
travel in one half of the screen without disturbing the other half. Word offers 
two ways to split the screen:
 
✦ Move the mouse pointer to the split box at the top of the scroll bar on 
the right. Move it just above the View Ruler button. When the pointer 
turns into double arrows, click and drag the gray line down the screen. 
When you release the mouse button, you have a split screen.

180
Selecting Text in Speedy Ways
 
 
✦ On the View tab, click the Split button. A gray line appears on-screen. 
Roll the mouse down until the gray line is where you want the split to 
be, and click. You get two screens split down the middle.
 
Figure 1-4: 
A split 
screen.
 
When you tire of this schizophrenic arrangement, click the Remove Split 
button on the View tab or drag the line to the top or bottom of the screen. 
You can also double-click the line that splits the screen in two.
 
In a split screen, you can choose a different view for the different halves. For 
example, click in the top half of the screen and choose Outline view to see 
your document in outline form, and click in the bottom half and choose Draft 
view to see the other half in Draft view. This way, you can see the headings 
in a document while you write the introduction.
Selecting Text in Speedy Ways
Book I, Chapter 2 explains how to enter text and change its appearance and 
size. After you enter text, you inevitably have to copy, move, or delete it, but 
you can’t do those tasks until you select it first. Table 1-1 describes short-
cuts for selecting text.
If a bunch of highlighted text is on-screen and you want it to go away but it 
won’t (because you pressed F8), press the Esc key.

Selecting Text in Speedy Ways
 
After you press F8, all the keyboard shortcuts for moving the cursor also 
work for selecting text. For example, press F8 and then press Ctrl+Home to 
select everything from the cursor to the top of the document. Later in this 
chapter, “Keys for getting around quickly” describes keyboard shortcuts for 
getting from place to place.

Moving Around Quickly in Documents
Moving Around Quickly in Documents
Besides sliding the scroll bar, Word offers a handful of very speedy tech-
niques for jumping around in documents: pressing shortcut keys, browsing 
in the Select Browse Object menu, using the Go To command, and navigating 
with the Document Map or thumbnails. Read on to discover how to get there 
faster, faster, faster.
Keys for getting around quickly
One of the fastest ways to go from place to place is to press the keys and key 
combinations listed in Table 1-2.
Table 1-2 
Keys for Moving Around Documents
Key to Press
Where It Takes You
PgUp
Up the length of one screen
PgDn
Down the length of one screen
Ctrl+PgUp
To the previous page in the document
Ctrl+PgDn
To the next page in the document
Ctrl+Home
To the top of the document
Ctrl+End
To the bottom of the 
document
If pressing Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+PgDn doesn’t get you to the top or bottom of a 
page, you clicked the Select Browse Object button at the bottom of the verti-
cal scroll bar, which makes Word go to the next bookmark, comment, head-
ing, or whatever. Click the Select Browse Object button and choose Browse 
By Page to make these key combinations work again.
 
Here’s a useful keystroke for getting from place to place: Shift+F5. Press it 
once to go to the location of your most recent edit. Press it two or three 
times to go back one or two edits before that. Pressing Shift+F5 is useful 
when you want to return to the place where you made an edit but can’t quite 
remember where that place is.
Navigating from page to page or heading to heading
In lengthy documents such as the one in Figure 1-5, the best way to get 
from place to place is to make use of the Navigation pane. Click a heading 
or a page in the Navigation pane and Word takes you there in the twinkling 
of an eye.

To display the Navigation pane, go to the View tab and click the Navigation 
Pane check box (you may have to click the Show button first). Then select a 
tab in the Navigation pane and go to it:
 
✦ Going from heading to heading: Select the Browse the Headings tab. 
Headings in your document appear (provided you assigned heading 
styles to headings). You can use the Navigation pane like a table of 
contents and click headings to get from place to place. Right-click a 
heading and choose a heading-level option on the shortcut menu to tell 
Word which headings to display. You can also right-click a heading and 
choose Expand All or Collapse All to see or hide lower-level headings.
 
✦ Going from page to page: Select the Browse the Pages tab. A thumbnail 
image of each page in the document appears. To quickly move from 
page to page, use the scroll bar in the Navigation pane or click a page 
thumbnail. Each thumbnail is numbered so that you always know which 
page you are viewing. 
”Browsing” around a document
 
 A really fast way to move around quickly is to click the Select Browse Object 
button in the lower-right corner of the screen. When you click this button 
(or press Ctrl+Alt+Home), Word presents 12 Browse By icons: Field, Endnote, 

184
Moving Around Quickly in Documents
Footnote, Comment, Section, Page, Go To, Find, Edits, Heading, Graphic, and 
Table. Select the icon that represents the element you want to go to, and 
Word takes you there immediately. For example, click the Browse by 
Heading icon to get to the next heading in your document (provided that 
you assigned heading styles to headings).
 
After you have selected a Browse By icon, the navigator buttons — the 
double arrows directly above and below the Select Browse Object button — 
turn blue. Click a blue navigator button to get to the next example or the 
previous example of the element you chose. For example, if you selected the 
Browse by Heading icon, all you have to do is click the blue navigator but-
tons to get from heading to heading, backward or forward in your document.
Going there fast with the Go To command
 
 Another fast way to go from place to place in a document is to use the Go To 
command. On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Find button and 
choose Go To (you may have to click the Editing button first). You see the 
Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-6. You 
can also open this dialog box by pressing Ctrl+G or F5.
 
Figure 1-6: 
Using the 
Go To 
command.
 
The Go to What menu in this dialog box lists everything that can conceivably 
be numbered in a Word document, and other things, too. Everything that 
you can get to with the Select Browse Object button, as well as lines, equa-
tions, and objects, can be reached by way of the Go To tab. Click a menu 
item, enter a number, choose an item from the drop-down list, or click the 
Previous, Next, or Go To buttons to go elsewhere.
Bookmarks for hopping around
Rather than press PgUp or PgDn or click the scroll bar to thrash around in a 
long document, you can use bookmarks. All you do is put a bookmark in an 
important spot in your document that you’ll return to many times. To return 
to that spot, open the Bookmark dialog box and select a bookmark name, as 
shown in Figure 1-7. True to the craft, the mystery writer whose bookmarks 
are shown in Figure 1-7 wrote the end of the story first and used bookmarks 
to jump back and forth between the beginning and end to make all the clues 
fit together.

Follow these instructions to handle bookmarks:
 
 
✦ Adding a bookmark: Click where you want the bookmark to go, visit the 
Insert tab, and click the Bookmark button (you may have to click the 
Links button first, depending on the size of your screen). Then, in the 
Bookmark dialog box, type a descriptive name in the Bookmark Name 
box, and click the Add button. Bookmarks can’t start with numbers or 
include blank spaces. You can also open the Bookmark dialog box by 
pressing Ctrl+Shift+F5.
 
✦ Going to a bookmark: On the Insert tab, click the Bookmark button (you 
may have to click the Links button first), double-click the bookmark in 
the Bookmark dialog box, and click the Close button.
 
✦ Deleting a bookmark: Select the bookmark in the Bookmark dialog box 
and click the Delete button.
 
Word uses bookmarks for many purposes. For example, bookmarks indicate 
where cross-references are located in a document.
Inserting a Whole File into a Document
One of the beautiful things about word processing is that you can recycle 
documents. Say that you wrote an essay on the Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher 
that would fit very nicely in a broader report on North American birds. You 
can insert the Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher document into your report docu-
ment:
 
1. Place the cursor where you want to insert the document.
 
 2. On the Insert tab, open the drop-down list on the Object button and 
choose Text from File.
 
 You see the Insert File dialog box.

4. Click the Insert button.
Entering Information Quickly in a Computerized Form
A form is a means of soliciting and recording information. You can use forms 
like the one shown in Figure 1-8 to enter data faster and to reduce data-entry 
errors. Instead of entering all the information by hand, you or a data-entry 
clerk can choose entries from combo boxes, drop-down lists, and date pick-
ers. You save time because you don’t have to enter all the information by 
hand, and the information you enter is more likely to be accurate because 
you choose it from prescribed lists instead of entering it yourself.
 
Figure 1-8: 
A data-entry 
form.
 
Drop-down list
Combo box
Date picker
To create a form like the one shown in Figure 1-8, start by creating a tem-
plate for your form and putting data-entry controls — the combo boxes, drop-
down lists, and date pickers — in the form. To fill out a form, you create a 
document from the form template and go to it. These pages explain how to 
create a form and use forms to record information.
Creating a computerized form
The first step in creating a data-entry form is to create a template for holding 
the form. After that, you design the form itself by labeling the data fields and 
creating the data-entry controls. Better keep reading.

Creating a template to hold the form
Follow these steps to create a new template:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose New.
 
 You see the Available Templates window.
 
2. Click the My Templates icon.
 
 The New dialog box appears. It lists Word templates that are on your 
computer.
 
3. Click the Template option button.
 
 You can find this button under Create New in the lower-right corner of 
the dialog box.
 
4. Click OK.
 
5. Click the Save button (or press Ctrl+S) to open the Save As dialog box.
 
6. Enter a descriptive name for your template and click the Save button.
 
 Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains templates in detail.
Creating the form and data-entry controls
Your next task is to create the form and data-entry controls for your tem-
plate. Enter labels on the form where you will enter information. The form in 
Figure 1-8, for example, has five labels: Name, Phone, Fee Paid?, Association, 
and Date. After you enter the labels, follow these steps to create the data-
entry controls:
 
1. Display the Developer tab, if necessary.
 
 If this tab isn’t showing, go to the File tab, choose Options, and on 
the Customize Ribbon tab of the Word Options dialog box, select the 
Developer check box and click OK. (Book VIII, Chapter 1 explains in 
detail how to customize the Ribbon.)
 
2. Click where you want to place a control, and then create the control 
by clicking a Controls button followed by the Properties button on the 
Developer tab.
 
 Here are instructions for creating three types of controls:
 
 
• Drop-down list: A drop-down list is a menu that “drops” when you 
open it to reveal different option choices (refer to Figure 1-8). Click 
the Drop-Down List Content Control button and then the Properties 
button. You see the Content Control Properties dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 1-9. For each option you want to place on the drop-down 
list, click the Add button, and in the Add Choice dialog box, enter the 
option’s name in the Display Name text box and click OK, as shown 
in Figure 1-9.

188
Entering Information Quickly in a Computerized Form
 
 
• Combo box: Like a drop-down list, a combo box “drops” to reveal 
choices. However, as well as choosing an option on the drop-down 
list, data-entry clerks can enter information in the box (refer to 
Figure 1-8). Click the Combo Box Content Control button and then 
the Properties button. In the Content Control Properties dialog box, 
enter option names the same way you enter them in a drop-down 
list, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 
 
• Date picker: A date picker is a mini-calendar from which data-entry 
clerks can enter a date (refer to Figure 1-8). Click the Date Picker 
Content Control button and then the Properties button. In the 
Content Control Properties dialog box, choose a display format for 
dates and click OK.
 
3. Click the Save button to save your template.
 
 Now you’re ready to use your newly made form to enter data.

Chapter 2: Laying Out 
Text and Pages
In This Chapter
✓ Entering a section break
✓ Starting a new line and page
✓ Changing the margins
✓ Indenting text
✓ Numbering pages and handling headers and footers
✓ Adjusting the space between lines and paragraphs
✓ Handling numbered and bulleted lists
✓ Hyphenating the text
T
his chapter explains how to format text and pages. A well-laid-out docu-
ment says a lot about how much time and thought was put into it. This 
chapter presents tips, tricks, and techniques for making pages look just 
right.
In this chapter, you find out what section breaks are and why they are so 
important to formatting. You discover how to establish the size of margins, 
indent text, number pages, construct headers and footers, determine how 
much space appears between lines of text, handle lists, and hyphenate text.
Paragraphs and Formatting
Back in English class, your teacher taught you that a paragraph is a part 
of a longer composition that presents one idea or, in the case of dialogue, 
presents the words of one speaker. Your teacher was right, too, but for word-
processing purposes, a paragraph is a lot less than that. In word processing, a 
paragraph is simply what you put on-screen before you press the Enter key.
For instance, a heading is a paragraph. If you press Enter on a blank line to 
go to the next line, the blank line is considered a paragraph. If you type Dear 
John at the top of a letter and press Enter, “Dear John” is a paragraph. 

192
Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
 
It’s important to know this because paragraphs have a lot to do with format-
ting. If you click the Paragraph group button on the Home tab and monkey 
around with the paragraph formatting in the Paragraph dialog box, your 
changes affect everything in the paragraph where the cursor is located. To 
make format changes to a whole paragraph, all you have to do is place the 
cursor there. You don’t have to select the paragraph. And if you want to 
make format changes to several paragraphs, all you have to do is select 
those paragraphs first.
Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
When you want to change page numbering schemes, headers and footers, 
margin sizes, and page orientations in a document, you have to create a sec-
tion break to start a new section. Word creates a new section for you when 
you create newspaper-style columns or change the size of margins.
Follow these steps to create a new section:
 
1. Click where you want to insert a section break.
 
 2. On the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks button.
 
 You open a drop-down list.
 
3. Under Section Breaks on the drop-down list, select a section break.
All four section break options create a new section, but they do so in differ-
ent ways:
 
✦ Next Page: Inserts a page break as well as a section break so that the 
new section can start at the top of a new page (the next one). Select this 
option to start a new chapter, for example.
 
✦ Continuous: Inserts a section break in the middle of a page. Select this 
option if, for example, you want to introduce newspaper-style columns 
in the middle of a page.
 
✦ Even Page: Starts the new section on the next even page. This option 
is good for two-sided documents in which the headers on the left- and 
right-side pages are different.
 
✦ Odd Page: Starts the new section on the next odd page. You might 
choose this option if you have a book in which chapters start on odd 
pages. (By convention, that’s where they start.)
 
To delete a section break, make sure that you are in Draft view so that you 
can see section breaks, click the dotted line, and press the Delete key.

Book II
Chapter 2
Laying Out Text 
and Pages
193
Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes
 
In the same way that paragraph marks store formats for a paragraph, sec-
tion breaks store formats for an entire section. When you delete a section 
break, you apply new formats, because the section is folded into the sec-
tion that formerly followed it and the section you deleted adopts that next 
section’s formats. Because it’s easy to accidentally delete a section break 
and create havoc, I recommend working in Draft view when your document 
has many section breaks. In Draft view, you can tell where a section ends 
because Section Break and a double dotted line appear on-screen. The 
only way to tell where a section ends in Print Layout view is to click the 
Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab. (You can make section information 
appear on the status bar. Right-click the status bar and choose Section on 
the pop-up menu.)
Seeing what the formats are
Sometimes seeing how text was formatted 
merely by looking is difficult. However, by 
pressing Shift+F1, you can see precisely how 
text and paragraphs were formatted in the 
Reveal Formatting task pane. It describes how 
the text, paragraph, and section where the 
cursor is located are formatted.
While the Reveal Formatting task pane is open, 
you can take advantage of these amenities:
 ✓ Compare one part of a document to 
another: Click the Compare to Another 
Section check box and then click another 
part of your document. The Reveal 
Formatting task pane describes how the 
two parts differ. Knowing how parts of a 
document differ can be invaluable when 
you’re creating and modifying styles.
 ✓ Find out which style was assigned: Click 
the Distinguish Style Source check box. 
The task pane lists the style you assigned 
to the part of your document where the 
cursor is located.
 ✓ See the formatting marks: Click the Show 
All Formatting Marks check box. You can 
see where paragraphs end, where line 
breaks are, and where tab spaces were 
entered. Clicking this check box has the 
same results as clicking the Show/Hide¶ 
button on the Home tab.

194
Breaking a Line
Breaking a Line
To break a line of text before it reaches the right margin without starting 
a new paragraph, press Shift+Enter. Figure 2-1 shows how you can press 
Shift+Enter to make lines break better. The paragraphs are identical, but I 
broke lines in the right-side paragraph to make the text easier to read. Line 
breaks are marked with the ↵ symbol. To erase line breaks, click the Show/
Hide¶ button to see these symbols and then backspace over them.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Break lines

reading 
easier.
 
Starting a New Page
Word gives you another page so that you can keep going when you fill up 
one page. But what if you’re impatient and want to start a new page right 
away? Whatever you do, don’t press Enter again and again until you fill up 
the page. Instead, create a hard page break by doing one the following on the 
Insert tab:
 
 
✦ Click the Page Break button (or press Ctrl+Enter). Word starts a new 
page at the cursor position. (You can also go to the Page Layout tab, 
click the Breaks button, choose Page on the drop-down list.)
 
 
✦ Click the Blank Page button. Word enters two hard page breaks to create 
an empty, blank page at the cursor position.
 
In Draft view, you can click the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab and 
tell where you inserted a hard page break because you see the words Page 
Break and a dotted line on-screen. You can’t tell where hard page breaks 
are in Print Layout view.
To delete a hard page break, switch to Draft view, click the Show/Hide¶ 
button on the Home tab, click the words Page Break, and press the 
Delete key. 
Setting Up and Changing the Margins
Margins are the empty spaces along the left, right, top, and bottom of a page, 
as shown in Figure 2-2. Headers and footers fall, respectively, in the top and 

Book II
Chapter 2
Laying Out Text 
and Pages
195
Setting Up and Changing the Margins
bottom margins. And you can put graphics, text boxes, and page numbers 
in the margins as well. Margins serve to frame the text and make it easier 
to read.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Margins in 
a two-sided 
document.

When you start a new document, give a moment’s thought to the margins. 
Changing the size of margins after you have entered the text, clip art, graph-
ics, and whatnot can be disastrous. Text is indented from the left and right 
margins. Pages break on the bottom margin. If you change margin settings, 
indents and page breaks change for good or ill throughout your document. 
By setting the margins carefully from the beginning, you can rest assured 
that text will land on the page where you want it to land.
 
Don’t confuse margins with indents. Text is indented from the margin, not 
from the edge of the page. If you want to change how far text falls from the 
page edge, indent it. To change margin settings in the middle of a document, 
you have to create a new section.
 
 To set up or change the margins, go to the Page Layout tab and click the 
Margins button. You see a drop-down list with margin settings. Either 
choose a setting or select Custom Margins to open the Margins tab of the 
Page Setup dialog box and choose among these commands for handling 
margins:
 
✦ Changing the size of the margins: Enter measurements in the Top, 
Bottom, Left, and Right boxes to tell Word how much blank space to put 
along the sides of the page.
 
✦ Making room for the gutter: The gutter is the part of the paper that 
the binding eats into when you bind a document. Enter a measurement 

196
Indenting Paragraphs and First Lines
in the Gutter box to increase the left or inside margin and make room 
for the binding. Notice on the pages of this book, for example, that the 
margin closest to the binding is wider than the outside margin. Choose 
Top on the Gutter Position menu if you intend to bind your document 
from the top, not the left, or inside, of the page. Some legal documents 
are bound this way.
 
✦ Using mirror margins (inside and outside margins) in two-sided docu-
ments: In a bound document in which text is printed on both sides of 
the pages, the terms left margin and right margin are meaningless. What 
matters instead is in the inside margin, the margin in the middle of the 
page spread next to the bindings, and the outside margin, the margin on 
the outside of the page spread that isn’t affected by the bindings (refer 
to Figure 2-2). Choose Mirror Margins on the Multiple Pages drop-down 
list and adjust the margins accordingly if you intend to print on both 
sides of the paper.
 
✦ Applying margin changes: On the Apply To drop-down list, choose 
Whole Document to apply your margin settings to the entire docu-
ment; This Section to apply them to a section; or This Point Forward to 
change margins in the rest of a document. When you choose This Point 
Forward, Word creates a new section.
If you’re in a hurry to change margins, you can change them on the ruler. 
Display the ruler and drag the Left Margin, Right Margin, or Top Margin 
marker. You can find these markers by moving the pointer onto a ruler and 
looking for the two-headed arrow near a margin boundary. It appears, along 
with a pop-up label, when the pointer is over a margin marker.
 
To get a good look at where margins are, go to the File tab and choose 
Options. In the Word Options dialog box, select the Advanced category, 
and click the Show Text Boundaries check box (you’ll find it under “Show 
Document Content”).
Indenting Paragraphs and First Lines
An indent is the distance between a margin and the text, not the edge of 
the page and the text. Word offers a handful of ways to change the indenta-
tion of paragraphs. You can change the indentation of first lines as well as 
entire paragraphs. To start, select all or part of the paragraphs you want to 
re-indent (just click in a paragraph if you want to re-indent only one para-
graph). Then click an Indent button, fiddle with the indentation marks on 
the ruler, or go to the Paragraph dialog box. All three techniques are 
described here.

Book II
Chapter 2
Laying Out Text 
and Pages
197
Indenting Paragraphs and First Lines
Clicking an Indent button (for left-indents)
 
 On the Home tab, click the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent button (or 
press Ctrl+M or Ctrl+Shift+M) to move a paragraph a half inch farther away 
from or closer to the left margin. If you created tab stops, text is indented to 
the next or previous tab stop as well as to the next or previous half inch. 
This is the fastest way to indent text, although you can’t indent first lines or 
indent from the right margin this way.
“Eye-balling it” with the ruler
You can also change indentations by using the ruler to “eyeball it.” This 
technique requires some dexterity with the mouse, but it allows you to see 
precisely where paragraphs and the first lines of paragraphs are indented. If 
necessary, display the ruler by going to the View tab and clicking the Ruler 
check box. Then click in or select the paragraph or paragraphs that need 
indenting and use these techniques to re-indent them:
 
✦ Indenting an entire paragraph from the left margin: Drag the left-indent 
marker on the ruler to the right. Figure 2-3 shows where this marker 
is located. Dragging the left-indent marker moves the first-line indent 
marker as well.
 
Figure 2-3:

✦ Indenting the first line of a paragraph: Drag the first-line indent marker 
to the right (refer to Figure 2-3). This marker determines how far the 
first line of the paragraph is indented.
 
✦ Making a hanging indent: Drag the hanging indent marker to the right of 
the first-line indent marker (refer to Figure 2-3). A hanging indent is one 

198
Numbering the Pages
in which the first line of a paragraph appears to “hang” into the margin 
because the second and subsequent lines are indented to the right of 
the start of the first line. Bulleted and numbered lists employ hanging 
indents.
 
✦ Indenting an entire paragraph from the right margin: Drag the right-
indent marker to the left (refer to Figure 2-3). 
Notice the shaded areas on the left and right side of the ruler. These areas 
represent the page margins.
Indenting in the Paragraph dialog box
Yet another way to indent a paragraph or first line is to visit the Paragraph 
dialog box. Click in or select the paragraph or paragraphs in question, go to 
the Home tab, and click the Paragraph group button. You see the Indents 
and Spacing tab of the Paragraph dialog box. Change the indentation set-
tings. If you want to indent the first line or create a hanging indent, choose 
First Line or Hanging on the Special drop-down list and enter a measurement 
in the By box.
Numbering the Pages
How do you want to number the pages in your document? You can number 
them in sequence starting with the number 1, start numbering pages with 
a number other than 1, use Roman numerals or other number formats, and 
include chapter numbers in page numbers. What’s more, you can number 
the pages differently in each section of your document as long as you 
divided your document into sections.
When it comes to numbering pages, you can proceed in two ways, as shown 
in Figure 2-4:
 
✦ Put a page number by itself on the pages of your document.
 
✦ Include the page number in the header or footer.
After you enter a page number, you can format it in different ways in the 
Page Number Format dialog box (see Figure 2-4) and (Header & Footer 
Tools) Design tab.
 
To handle page numbers (as well as headers and footers), you must be in 
Print Layout view. Click the Print Layout view button on the status bar or go 
to the View tab and click the Print Layout button.

3. On the submenu that appears, choose a page number option.
 
 The farther you scroll on the submenu, the fancier the page number 
formats are.
If you change your mind about the page number format you chose, switch 
to Print Layout view and double-click in the header or footer where the page 
number is displayed. The (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab opens. Click 
the Page Number button and make a different choice, or choose Remove 
Page Numbers.

Numbering the Pages
Including a page number in a header or footer
To put the page number part in a header or footer, click in the header or 
footer where you want the page number to appear (later in this chapter, 
“Putting Headers and Footers on Pages” explains headers and footers). Then 
follow these steps to insert the page number:
 
 1. On the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab, click the Page Number 
button.
 
2. Choose Current Position.
 
 You see a submenu with page number choices.
 
3. Scroll through the submenu and choose a page number format.
 
 The “Page X of Y” option is for listing the total number of pages in a 
document as well as the page number. For example, page 2 of a 10-page 
document is numbered “Page 2 of 10.”
Changing page number formats
Change page number formats in the Page Number Format dialog box (refer 
to Figure 2-4). To display this dialog box, make sure that you’re in Print 
Layout view and double-click your header or footer. Then use one of the 
following methods to change page number formats:
 
 
✦ On the Insert tab, click the Page Number button and choose Format 
Page Numbers.
 
✦ On the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab, click the Page Number 
button and choose Format Page Numbers.
In the Page Number Format dialog box, make your page numbers just so:
 
✦ Choosing a different number format: Open the Number Format drop-
down list and choose a page-numbering format. You can use numbers, 
letters, or roman numerals.
 
✦ Including chapter numbers in page numbers: If your document gener-
ates chapter numbers automatically from headings assigned the same 
style (a subject not covered in this book), you can include the chapter 
number in the page number. Click the Include Chapter Number check 
box, choose a style, and choose a separator to go between the chapter 
number and page number.
 
✦ Numbering each section separately: Click the Start At option button 
(not the Continue from Previous Section button) to begin counting 
pages anew at each section in your document. Earlier in this chapter, 
“Inserting a Section Break for Formatting Purposes” explains sections.
 
✦ Start numbering pages at a number other than 1: Click the Start At 
option button and enter a number other than 1.

Putting Headers and Footers on Pages
 
To keep some pages in a document from being numbered, create a section 
for those pages, and then remove page numbers from the section. To pagi-
nate your document, Word skips the section you created and resumes num-
bering pages in the following section.
Putting Headers and Footers on Pages
A header is a little description that appears along the top of a page so that 
the reader knows what’s what. Usually, headers include the page number 
and a title, and often the author’s name appears in the header as well. A 
footer is the same thing as a header except that it appears along the bottom 
of the page, as befits its name.
These pages explain everything a mere mortal needs to know about headers 
and footers. Meanwhile, here are the ground rules for managing them:
 
 
✦ Switching to Print Layout view: To enter, read, edit, or delete headers 
and footers, you must be in Print Layout view. You can’t see headers 
and footers in the other views.
 
✦ Displaying the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab: As shown in Figure 
2-5, you manage headers and footers by way of buttons on the (Header 
& Footer Tools) Design tab. To display this tab after you create a header 
or footer, switch to Print Layout view and double-click a header or footer.
 
 
✦ Closing the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab: Click the Close Header 
& Footer button or double-click outside the header or footer.
 
✦ Placing different headers and footers in the same document: To 
change headers or footers in the middle of a document, you have to 
create a new section. See “Inserting a Section Break for Formatting 
Purposes” earlier in this chapter.

presents headers or footers with preformatted page numbers, dates, 
and places to enter a document title and author’s name. Click More 
Headers (or Footers) from Office.com to download headers or footers 
from Microsoft. (Later in this chapter, “Fine-tuning a header or footer” 
explains how to insert the date and time and change headers and foot-
ers from section to section.)
 
✦ Choosing a different header or footer: Don’t like the header or footer 
you chose? If necessary, double-click your header or footer to display 
the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab. Then click the Header or Footer 
button and choose a new header or footer from the gallery.
 
✦ Editing a header or footer: Click the Header or the Footer button and 
choose Edit Header or Edit Footer on the drop-down list. The cursor 
moves into the header or footer so that you can enter or format text.
 
✦ Changing the appearance of a header or footer: Click a shape or text 
box in a header or footer and visit the (Drawing Tools) Format tab to 
change the shape or text box’s color, background, or size. (Book I, 
Chapter 8 describes the drawing tools.)
 
✦ Removing a header or footer: Click the Header or Footer button and 
choose Remove Header or Remove Footer on the drop-down list.
To switch back and forth between the header and footer, click the Go to 
Header or Go to Footer button on the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab.
 
As you work away on your header and footer, you can call on most of the 
text-formatting commands on the Home tab. You can change the text’s font 
and font size, click an alignment button, and paste text from the Clipboard. 
Tabs are set up in most headers and footers to make it possible to center, 
left-align, and right-align text. You can click the Insert Alignment Tab button 
on the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab to insert a new tab.
Fine-tuning a header or footer
Here is advice for making a perfect header on the (Header & Footer Tools) 
Design tab:
 
✦ Inserting a page number: See “Including a page number in a header or 
footer” and “Changing page number formats” earlier in this chapter.
 
 
✦ Inserting the date and time: Click the Date & Time button, choose a 
date format in the Date and Time dialog box, and click OK. Click the 
Update Automatically check box if you want the date to record when 
you print the document, not when you created your header or footer.

Putting Headers and Footers on Pages
 
 ✦ Changing headers and footers from section to section: Use the Link to 
Previous button to determine whether headers and footers are different 
from section to section (you must divide the document into sections to 
have different headers and footers). Deselecting this button tells Word 
that you want your header or footer to be different from the header or 
footer in the previous section of the document; selecting this button 
(clicking it so that it looks selected) tells Word that you want your 
header or footer to be the same as the header or footer in the previous 
section of your document. To make a different header or footer, deselect 
the Link to Previous button and enter a different header or footer.
 
 When the header or footer is the same as that of the previous section, 
the Header or Footer box reads Same as Previous (refer to Figure 2-5); 
when the header or footer is different from that of the previous section, the 
words Same as Previous don’t appear. You can click the Previous or 
Next button to examine the header or footer in the previous or next section.
 
✦ Different headers and footers for odd and even pages: Click the Different 
Odd & Even Pages check box to create different headers and footers for 
odd and even pages. As “Setting Up and Changing the Margins” explains 
When you click the Header or the Footer button 
on the Insert tab, a gallery appears with head-
ers or footers. You can create your own header 
or footer and place it on this gallery. For exam-
ple, create a header or footer with your com-
pany logo. After you design and create your 
header or footer, follow these instructions to 
wrangle with it:
 ✓ Placing a header or footer in the gallery: 
Select your header or footer by dragging 
over it or by clicking in the margin to its left. 
On the (Header & Footer Tools) Design tab, 
click the Quick Parts button and choose 
Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery. You 
see the Create New Building Block dialog 
box. Enter a descriptive name for the header 
or footer, choose Footers or Headers on the 
Gallery drop-down list, and click OK.
 ✓ Inserting a header or footer you cre-
ated: On the Insert tab, click the Header 
or Footer button and choose your header 
or footer in the gallery. It is located in the 
Built-In or General category, depending on 
where you chose to put it. 
 ✓ Removing and editing headers or foot-
ers: On the Insert tab, click the Quick 
Parts button and choose Building Blocks 
Organizer. The Building Blocks Organizer 
dialog box appears. Select your header 
or footer and click the Delete button to 
remove it from the gallery or the Edit 
Properties button to change its name, gal-
lery assignment, or category assignment.
Creating your own header or footer for the gallery

204
Adjusting the Space Between Lines
earlier in this chapter, documents in which text is printed on both sides 
of the page can have different headers and footers for the left and right 
side of the page spread. The Header or Footer box reads Odd or Even to 
tell you which side of the page spread you’re dealing with as you enter 
your header or footer.
 
✦ Removing headers and footers from the first page: Click the Different 
First Page check box to remove a header or footer from the first page of 
a document or section. Typically, the first page of letters and reports are 
not numbered.
Adjusting the Space Between Lines
 
 To change the spacing between lines, select the lines whose spacing you 
want to change, or simply put the cursor in a paragraph if you’re changing 
the line spacing throughout a paragraph (if you’re just starting a document, 
you’re ready to go). Then, on the Home tab, click the Line and Paragraph 
Spacing button and choose an option on the drop-down list. 
To take advantage of more line-spacing options, click the Paragraph group 
button on the Home tab or choose Line Spacing Options on the Line and 
Paragraph Spacing button drop-down list. You see the Paragraph dialog box. 
Select an option on the Line Spacing drop-down list:
 
✦ At Least: Choose this one if you want Word to adjust for tall symbols 
or other unusual text. Word adjusts the lines but makes sure that there 
is, at minimum, the number of points you enter in the At box between 
each line.
 
✦ Exactly: Choose this one and enter a number in the At box if you want a 
specific amount of space between lines.
 
✦ Multiple: Choose this one and put a number in the At box to get triple-
spaced, quadruple-, quintuple-, or any other number of spaced lines.
 
To quickly single-space text, click the text or select it if you want to change 
more than one paragraph, and press Ctrl+1. To quickly double-space text, 
select the text and press Ctrl+2. Press Ctrl+5 to put one and a half lines 
between lines of text.
Adjusting the Space between Paragraphs
Rather than press Enter to put a blank line between paragraphs, you can 
open the Paragraph dialog box and enter a point-size measurement in the 
Before or After text box. The Before and After measurements place a specific 
amount of space before and after paragraphs.

Book II
Chapter 2
Laying Out Text

205
Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists
 
Truth be told, the Before and After options are for use with styles (a subject 
of the next chapter). When you create a style, you can tell Word to always 
follow a paragraph in a certain style with a paragraph in another style. For 
example, a paragraph in the Chapter Title style might always be followed by 
a paragraph in the Chapter Intro style. In cases like these, when you know 
that paragraphs assigned to one type of style will always follow paragraphs 
assigned to another style, you can confidently put space before and after 
paragraphs. But if you use the Before and After styles indiscriminately, you 
can end up with large blank spaces between paragraphs. 
Go to the Home tab and use one of these techniques to adjust the amount of 
space between paragraphs:
 
 
✦ Click the Line and Paragraph Spacing button and choose Add Space 
Before Paragraph or Add Space after Paragraph on the drop-down list. 
These commands place 10 points of blank space before or after the para-
graph that the cursor is in.
 
✦ Click the Paragraph group button to open the Paragraph dialog box, 
and enter point-size measurements in the Before and After boxes (or 
choose Auto in these boxes to enter one blank line between paragraphs 
in whatever your line-spacing choice is). The Don’t Add Space between 
Paragraphs of the Same Style check box tells Word to ignore Before and 
After measurements if the previous or next paragraph is assigned the 
same style as the paragraph that the cursor is in. 
Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists
What is a word-processed document without a list or two? It’s like an 
emperor with no clothes. Numbered lists are invaluable in manuals and 
books like this one that present a lot of step-by-step procedures. Use bul-
leted lists when you want to present alternatives to the reader. A bullet is a 
black, filled-in circle or other character. These pages explained numbered 
lists, bulleted lists, and multilevel lists.
Simple numbered and bulleted lists
 
 The fastest, cleanest, and most honest way to create a numbered or bulleted 
list is to enter the text without any concern for numbers or bullets. Just 
press Enter at the end of each step or bulleted entry. When you’re done, 
select the list, go to the Home tab, and click the Numbering or Bullets 
button. You can also click the Numbering or Bullets button and start typing 
the list. Each time you press Enter, Word enters the next number or another 
bullet.

206
Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists
Meanwhile, here are some tricks for handling lists:
 
✦ Ending a list: Press the Enter key twice after typing the last entry in the 
list. You can also right-click the list, choose Bullets or Numbering, and 
choose None on the submenu. 
 
✦ Removing the numbers or bullets: Select the list and click the 
Numbering or Bullets button.
 
✦ Adjusting how far a list is indented: Right-click anywhere in the list, 
choose Adjust List Indents, and enter a new measurement in the Text 
Indent box.
 
 
✦ Resuming a numbered list: Suppose that you want a numbered list to 
resume where a list you entered earlier ended. In other words, suppose 
that you left off writing a four-step list, put in a graphic or some para-
graphs, and now you want to resume the list at Step 5. Click the 
Numbering button to start numbering again. The AutoCorrect Options 
button appears. Click it and choose Continue Numbering, or right-click 
and choose Continue Numbering on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Starting a new list: Suppose that you want to start a brand-new list right 
away. Right-click the number Word entered and choose Restart at 1 on 
the shortcut menu. 
Constructing lists of your own
If you are an individualist and you want numbered and bulleted lists to work 
your way, follow these instructions for choosing unusual bullet characters 
and number formats:
Word creates automatic lists for you whether 
you like it or not. To see what I mean, type the 
number 1, type a period, and press the space-
bar. Word immediately creates a numbered list. 
In the same manner, Word creates a bulleted 
list when you type an asterisk (*) and press the 
spacebar.
Some people find this kind of behind-the-
scenes skulduggery annoying. If you are one 
such person, do one of the following to keep 
Word from making lists automatically:
 ✓ Click the AutoCorrect Options button — it 
appears automatically — and choose Stop 
Automatically Creating Lists.
 ✓ On the File tab, choose Options, select the 
Proofing category in the Word Options 
dialog box, and click the AutoCorrect 
Options button. On the AutoFormat As You 
Type tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box, 
uncheck the Automatic Numbered Lists 
and Automatic Bulleted Lists check boxes.

✦ Choosing a different numbering scheme: On the Home tab, open the 
drop-down list on the Numbering button and choose a numbering 
scheme. You can also choose Define New Number Format. As shown in 
Figure 2-6, you see the Define New Number Format dialog box, where 
you can choose a number format, choose a font for numbers, and toy 
with number alignments.
 
 
✦ Choosing a different bullet character: On the Home tab, open the 
drop-down list on the Bullets button and choose a different bullet char-
acter on the drop-down list. You can also choose Define New Bullet to 
open the Define New Bullet dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6, and click 
the Symbol button to choose a bullet character in the Symbol dialog 
box (Book I, Chapter 2 describes symbols). The dialog box also offers 
opportunities for indenting bullets and the text that follows them in 
unusual ways.

Managing a multilevel list
A multilevel list, also called a nested list, is a list with subordinate entries, as 
shown in Figure 2-7. To create a multilevel list, you declare what kind of list 
you want, and then, as you enter items for the list, you indent the items that 
you want to be subordinate. Follow these steps to create a multilevel list:
 
 1. On the Home tab, click the Multilevel List button and choose what 
kind of list you want.
 
 If none of the lists suit you, you can choose Define New Multilevel List 
and create a new kind of list in the Define New Multilevel List dialog box.
 
2. Enter the items for the list, pressing Enter as you complete each one.

208
Working with Tabs
 
3. Select a list item (or items) and click the Increase Indent button (or press 
Ctrl+M) to make the items subordinate in the list; click the Decrease 
Indent button (or press Ctrl+Shift+M) to raise their rank in the list.
 
 Repeat Step 3 until the list is just so.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Examples 
of multilevel 
lists.
 
Working with Tabs
Tabs are a throwback to the days of the typewriter, when it was necessary 
to make tab stops in order to align text. Except for making leaders and align-
ing text in headers and footers, everything you can do with tabs can also be 
done by creating a table — and it can be done far faster. All you have to do 
is align the text inside the table and then remove the table borders. (Book I, 
Chapter 5 explains tables.)
A tab stop is a point around which or against which text is formatted. As 
shown in Figure 2-8, Word offers five tab types for aligning text: Left, Center, 
Right, Decimal, and Bar (a bar tab stop merely draws a vertical line on the 
page). When you press the Tab key, you advance the text cursor by one tab 
stop. Tab stops are shown on the ruler; symbols on the ruler tell you what 
type of tab you’re dealing with.
By default, tabs are left-aligned and are set at half-inch intervals. Display the 
ruler (click the Ruler check box on the View tab) and follow these steps to 
change tabs or change where tabs appear on the ruler:
 
1. Select the paragraphs that need different tab settings.
 
2. Click the Tab box on the left side of the ruler as many times as neces-
sary to choose the kind of tab you want.
 
 Symbols on the tab box indicate which type of tab you’re choosing.
 
3. Click on the ruler where you want the tab to go.
 
 You can click as many times as you want and enter more than one kind 
of tab.

In my opinion, the only reason to fool with tabs 
and tab stops is to create tab leaders like the 
ones shown here. A leader is a series of punc-
tuation marks — periods in the illustration — 
that connect text across a page. Leaders are 
very elegant. For the figure, I used left-aligned 
tab stops for the characters’ names and right-
aligned tab stops for the players’ names. I 
included leaders so that you can tell precisely 
who played whom.
Follow these steps to create tab leaders:
 1. Enter the text and, in each line, enter a tab 
space between the text on the left side 
and the text on the right side.
 2. Select the text you entered.
 3. On the Home tab, click the Paragraph 
group button, and in the Paragraph dialog 
box, click the Tabs button.
 
 You see the Tabs dialog box.
 4. Enter a position for the first new tab in the 
Tab Stop Position box.
 5. Under Leader in the dialog box, select the 
punctuation symbol you want for the leader.
 6. Click OK, display the ruler, and drag tab 
markers to adjust the space between the 
text on the left and right.
All about tab leaders

Hyphenating Text
To move a tab stop, drag it to a new location on the ruler. Text that is 
aligned with the tab stop moves as well. To remove a tab stop, drag it off the 
ruler. When you remove a tab stop, text to which it was aligned is aligned to 
the next remaining tab stop on the ruler or to the next default tab stop if you 
didn’t create any tab stops of your own.
 
 Sometimes it’s hard to tell where tabs were put in the text. To find out, click 
the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab to see the formatting characters, 
including the arrows that show where the Tab key was pressed.
Hyphenating Text
The first thing you should know about hyphenating words is that you may 
not need to do it. Text that hasn’t been hyphenated is much easier to read, 
which is why the majority of text in this book, for example, isn’t hyphenated. 
It has a ragged right margin, to borrow typesetter lingo. Hyphenate only when 
text is trapped in columns or in other narrow places, or when you want a 
very formal-looking document.
 
Do not insert a hyphen simply by pressing the hyphen key, because the 
hyphen will stay there even if the word moves to the middle of a line and 
doesn’t need to be broken in half. Instead, when a big gap appears in the 
right margin and a word is crying out to be hyphenated, put the cursor 
where the hyphen needs to go and press Ctrl+hyphen. This way, you enter 
what is called a discretionary hyphen, and the hyphen appears only if the 
word breaks at the end of a line. (To remove a manual hyphen, press the 
Show/Hide¶ button so that you can see it, and then backspace over it.)
Automatically and manually 
hyphenating a document 
 
 Select text if you want to hyphenate part of a document, not all of it, and use 
one of these techniques to hyphenate words that break on the end of a line 
of text:
 
✦ Automatic hyphenation: On the Page Layout tab, click the Hyphenation 
button and choose Automatic on the drop-down list. Word hyphenates 
your document (or a portion of your document, if you selected it first).
 
 You can tell Word how to hyphenate automatically by clicking the 
Hyphenation button and choosing Hyphenation Options. You see the 
Hyphenation dialog box shown in Figure 2-9. Deselect the Hyphenate 
Words in CAPS check box if you don’t care to hyphenate words in 
uppercase. Words that fall in the hyphenation zone are hyphenated, so

Hyphenating Text
enlarging the hyphenation zone means a less ragged right margin 
but more ugly hyphens, and a small zone means fewer ugly hyphens but 
a more ragged right margin. You can limit how many hyphens appear 
consecutively by entering a number in the Limit Consecutive Hyphens 
To box.
 
Figure 2-9:

how to 
hyphenate 
(left) and 
deciding 
where a

goes (right).
 
 
✦ Manual hyphenation: On the Page Layout tab, click the Hyphenation 
button and choose Manual on the drop-down list. Word displays a box 
with some hyphenation choices in it (refer to Figure 2-9). The cursor 
blinks on the spot where Word suggests putting a hyphen. Click Yes or 
No to accept or reject Word’s suggestion. Keep accepting or rejecting 
Word’s suggestions until the text is hyphenated.
Here is something about hyphens that editors and 
typesetters know, but the general public does not 
know: There is a difference between hyphens 
and dashes. Most people insert a hyphen where 
they ought to use an em dash or an en dash:
 ✓ An em dash  looks like a hyphen but is wider — 
it’s as wide as the letter m. The previous sen-
tence has an em dash in it. Did you notice?
 ✓ An en dash is the width of the letter n. Use 
en dashes to show inclusive numbers or 
time periods, like so: pp. 45–50; Aug.–Sept. 
1998; Exodus 16:11–16:18. An en dash is a 
little bit longer than a hyphen.
To place an em or en dash in a document and 
impress your local typesetter or editor, not 
to mention your readers, press Ctrl+Alt+– 
(the minus sign key on the Numeric keypad) 
to enter an em dash, or Ctrl+– (on the numeric 
keypad) to enter an en dash. You can also go 
to the Insert tab, click the Symbol button, 
choose More Symbols on the drop-down list, 
select the Special Characters tab in the Symbol 
dialog box, and choose Em Dash or En Dash.

Unhyphenating and other hyphenation tasks
More hyphenation esoterica:
 
✦ Unhyphenating: To “unhyphenate” a document or text you hyphenated 
automatically, go to the Page Layout tab, click the Hyphenation button, 
and choose Hyphenation Options. In the Hyphenation dialog box (refer 
to Figure 2-9), deselect the Automatically Hyphenate Document check 
box and click OK.
 
✦ Preventing text from being hyphenated: Select the text and, on the 
Home tab, click the Paragraph group button. In the Paragraph dialog 
box, select the Line and Page Breaks tab, and select the Don’t Hyphenate 
check box. (If you can’t hyphenate a paragraph, it’s probably because 
this box was selected unintentionally.)

Chapter 3: Word Styles
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering how styles and templates work
✓ Applying a new style
✓ Creating your own styles
✓ Altering a style
✓ Creating a new template
W
elcome to what may be the most important chapter of this book — 
the most important in Book II, anyway. Styles can save a ridiculous 
amount of time that you would otherwise spend formatting and wrestling 
with text. And many Word features rely on styles. You can’t create a table of 
contents or use the Navigation pane unless each heading in your document 
has been assigned a heading style. Nor can you take advantage of Outline 
view and the commands for moving text around in that view. You can’t 
cross-reference headings or number the headings in a document.
If you want to be stylish, at least where Word is concerned, you have to 
know about styles.
All about Styles
A style is a collection of formatting commands assembled under one name. 
When you apply a style, you give many formatting commands simultane-
ously, and you spare yourself the trouble of visiting numerous tabs and 
dialog boxes to format text. Styles save time and make documents look more 
professional. Headings assigned the same style — Heading1, for example — 
all look the same. When readers see that headings and paragraphs are 
consistent with one another across all the pages of a document, they get a 
warm, fuzzy feeling. They think the person who created the document really 
knew what he or she was doing.
Styles and templates
 
Every document comes with built-in styles that it inherits from the template 
with which it was created. You can create your own styles to supplement 
styles from the template. For that matter, you can create a template, popu-
late it with styles you design, and use your new template to create distinc-
tive letters or reports for your company.

214
All about Styles
A simple document created with the Blank Document template — a docu-
ment that you create by pressing Ctrl+N — has only a few styles, but a 
document that was created with a sophisticated template comes with many 
styles. The Oriel Report template, for example, comes with styles for format-
ting titles, subtitles, headings, and quotations. Figure 3-1 illustrates how 
choosing styles from a template changes text formatting. Notice how choos-
ing style options in the Styles pane reformats the text.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Apply styles 
to reformat 
text.
 
Styles pane
Types of styles
In the Styles pane (refer to Figure 3-1), the symbol next to each style name 
tells you what type of style you’re dealing with. Word offers four style types:
 
 
✦ Paragraph styles: Determine the formatting of entire paragraphs. A 
paragraph style can include these settings: font, paragraph, tab, border, 
language, bullets, numbering, and text effects. Paragraph styles are 
marked with the paragraph symbol (¶).
 
 
✦ Character styles: Apply to text, not to paragraphs. You select text 
before you apply a character style. Create a character style for text that 
is hard to lay out and for foreign-language text. A character style can 
include these settings: font, border, language, and text effects. When you 
apply a character style to text, the character-style settings override the 
paragraph-style settings. For example, if the paragraph style calls for 
14-point Arial font but the character style calls for 12-point Times Roman 
font, the character style wins. Character styles are marked with the 
letter a.

Applying Styles to Text and Paragraphs
Word offers several ways to apply a style, and you are invited to choose 
the one that works best for you. These pages explain how to apply a style 
and tell Word how to present style names in the various places where style 
names are presented for your enjoyment and pleasure.
Applying a style
 
The first step in applying a style is to select the part of your document that 
needs a style change:
 
✦ A paragraph or paragraphs: Because paragraph styles apply to all the 
text in a paragraph, you need only click in a paragraph before applying 
a style to make a style apply throughout the paragraph. To apply a style 
to several paragraphs, select all or part of them.
 
✦ Text: To apply a character style, select the letters whose formatting you 
want to change.
Next, apply the style with one of these techniques:
 
✦ Quick Style gallery: On the Home tab, choose a style in the Quick Style 
gallery (depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the 
Quick Styles button first). Figure 3-2 shows where the Quick Style gallery 
is located. The formatted letters above each style name in the gallery 
show you what your style choice will do to paragraphs or text. You can 
”live-preview” styles on the Quick Style gallery by moving the pointer 
over style names.
 
✦ Styles pane: On the Home tab, click the Styles group button to open the 
Styles pane, and select a style, as shown in Figure 3-2. Click the Show 
Preview check box at the bottom of the Styles pane to see formatted 
style names in the pane and get an idea of what the different styles are. 
You can drag the Styles pane to different locations on your screen. It 
remains on-screen after you leave the Home tab.
 
✦ Apply Styles task pane: Choose a style on the Apply Styles task pane, as 
shown in Figure 3-2. To display this task pane, go to the Home tab, open 
the Quick Style gallery, and choose Apply Styles (look for this option at 
the bottom of the gallery). You can drag the Apply Styles task pane to a 
corner of the screen. As does the Styles pane, the Apply Styles task pane 
remains on-screen after you leave the Home tab.

To strip a paragraph or text of its style and give it the generic Normal style, 
select it and choose Clear Formatting in the Quick Style gallery or Clear All 
at the top of the Styles pane.
A handful of keyboard shortcuts can be very 
handy when applying paragraph styles:
 ✓ Normal: Ctrl+Shift+N
 ✓ Heading 1: Ctrl+Alt+1
 ✓ Heading 2: Ctrl+Alt+2
 ✓ Heading 3: Ctrl+Alt+3
 ✓ Next higher heading: Alt+Shift+←
 ✓ Next lower heading: Alt+Shift+→
You can assign keyboard shortcuts to styles.

Applying Styles to Text and Paragraphs
Experimenting with style sets
A style set is a slight variation on the styles in the template you chose when 
you created your document. Style sets include Classic, Elegant, Fancy, 
and Modern. Choosing a style set imposes a slightly different look on your 
document — you make it classier, more elegant, fancier, or more modern. 
All templates, even those you create yourself, offer style sets. Style sets are a 
convenient way to experiment with the overall look of a document.
 
 To experiment with style sets, go to the Home tab, click the Change Styles 
button, choose Style Set on the drop-down list, and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose a new style set: Select a style set on the submenu.
 
✦ Use the original styles in the template: Choose Reset to Quick Styles 
from Template on the submenu.
Choosing which style names 
appear on the Style menus
One of the challenges of applying styles is finding the right style to apply 
in the Quick Style gallery, Styles pane, or Apply Styles task pane (refer to 
Figure 3-2). All three can become crowded with style names. To make finding 
and choosing styles names easier, you can decide for yourself which names 
appear on the three style menus.
Quick Style gallery
In the Quick Style gallery, remove a style name by right-clicking it and choos-
ing Remove from Quick Style gallery. If you regret removing style names, 
click the Change Styles button and choose Style Set➪Reset to Quick Styles 
from Template.
Styles pane and Apply styles task pane
To decide for yourself which style names appear in the Styles pane and 
Apply Styles task pane, click the Styles group button, and in the Styles pane, 
click the Options link (you can find this link near the bottom of the pane). 
You see the Style Pane Options dialog box shown in Figure 3-3. Choose 
options to tell Word which style names appear in the Styles pane and Apply 
Styles task pane:
 
✦ Select Styles to Show: Choose All Styles to show all style names. The 
other options place a subset of names in the window and task pane. 
Recommended style names are those Microsoft thinks you need 
most often.

✦ Select How List Is Sorted: Choose an option to describe how to list 
styles. Except for Based On, these options, I think, are self-explanatory. 
The Based On option lists styles in alphabetical order according to 
which style each style is based on (later in this chapter, “Creating a style 
from the ground up” explains how the Based On setting is used in con-
structing styles).
 
✦ Select Formatting to Show As Styles: Choose options to declare which 
styles to list — those that pertain to paragraph-level formatting, fonts, 
and bulleted and numbered lists.
How can you tell which style has been applied 
to a paragraph or text? Sometimes you need to 
know which style is in play before you decide 
whether applying a different style is necessary.
Click the paragraph or text and use these tech-
niques to find out which style was applied to it:
 ✓ Glance at the Quick Style gallery and 
Styles pane to see which style is selected. 
The selected style is the one that was 
applied to your paragraph or text.
 ✓ Click the Style Inspector button at the 
bottom of the Styles pane. The Style 
Inspector pane opens and lists the current 
style.
 ✓ Press Shift+F1. The Reveal Formatting 
task pane opens. It lists the style that was 
applied to the paragraph or text.
If you’re especially keen to know about styles 
in your document, you can make style names 
appear to the left of the text in Outline and Draft 
view. On the Find tab, choose Options. In the 
Word Options dialog box, go to the Advanced 
tab and enter .5 or another measurement in 
the Style Area Pane Width in Draft and Outline 
Views box (look for this box under “Display”). 
You can drag the border of the Style Area pane 
to enlarge or shrink it.

✦ Select How Built-In Style Names Are Shown: Choose options to tell how 
to handle built-in styles, the obscure styles that Word applies on its own 
when you create tables of contents and other self-generating lists.
 
✦ Apply to this document or to the template as well: Click the Only in 
This Document option button to apply your choices only to the docu-
ment you’re working on; click the New Documents Based on This 
Template option button to apply your choices to your document and to 
all future documents you create with the template you’re using.
Creating a New Style
You can create a new style by creating it from a paragraph or building it 
from the ground up. To do a thorough job, build it from the ground up 
because styles you create this way can be made part of the template you 
are currently working in and can be copied to other templates (later in this 
chapter, “Creating and Managing Templates” explains templates).
Creating a style from a paragraph
Follow these steps to create a new style from a paragraph:
 
1. Click in a paragraph whose formatting you want to turn into a style.
 
2. Right-click and choose Styles➪Save Selection As a New Quick Style.
 
 You see the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box. You can also 
open this dialog box by opening the Quick Style gallery and choosing 
Save Selection As a New Quick Style.
 
3. Enter a name for your new style.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 A style you create this way becomes a part of the document you’re 
working on; it isn’t made part of the template from which you created 
your document.
Creating a style from the ground up
 
 To make a style available in documents you will create in the future, make it 
part of a template and build it from the ground up. In the Styles pane, click 
the New Style button (you can find it at the bottom of the pane). You see the 
Create New Style from Formatting dialog box shown in Figure 3-4. Fill in the 
dialog box and click OK.

220
Creating a New Style
 
Figure 3-4: 
Creating 
a brand-
spanking-
new style.
 
Here’s a rundown of the options in the Create New Style from Formatting 
dialog box:
 
✦ Name: Enter a descriptive name for the style.
 
✦ Style Type: On the drop-down list, choose a style type (“Types of 
styles,” earlier in this chapter, describes the style types).
 
✦ Style Based On: If your new style is similar to a style that is already part 
of the template with which you created your document, choose the style 
to get a head start on creating the new one. Be warned, however, that 
if you or someone else changes the Based On style, your new style will 
inherit those changes and be altered as well.
 
✦ Style for Following Paragraph: Choose a style from the drop-down list 
if the style you’re creating is always followed by an existing style. For 
example, a new style called Chapter Title might always be followed by 
a style called Chapter Intro Paragraph. For convenience, someone who 
applies the style you’re creating and presses Enter automatically applies 
the style you choose here on the next line of the document. Applying a 
style automatically to the following paragraph saves you the trouble of 
having to apply the style yourself.
 
✦ Formatting: Choose options from the menus or click buttons to fashion 
or refine your style (you can also click the Format button to do this).
 
✦ Add to Quick Style List: Select this check box to make the style’s 
name appear in the Quick Style gallery, Styles pane, and Apply Styles 
task pane.

221
Modifying a Style
 
✦ Automatically Update: Normally, when you make a formatting change to 
a paragraph, the style assigned to the paragraph does not change at all, 
but the style does change if you check this box. Checking this box tells 
Word to alter the style itself each time you alter a paragraph to which 
you’ve assigned the style. With this box checked, all paragraphs in the 
document that were assigned the style are altered each time you change 
a single paragraph that was assigned the style.
 
✦ Only in This Document/New Documents Based on This Template: To 
make your style a part of the template from which you created your docu-
ment as well as the document itself, click the New Documents Based on 
This Template option button. This way, new documents you create that are 
based on the template you are using can also make use of the new style.
 
✦ Format: This is the important one. Click the button and make a format-
ting choice. Word takes you to dialog boxes so that you can create or 
refine the style.
Modifying a Style
What if you decide at the end of an 80-page document that all 35 introduc-
tory paragraphs to which you assigned the Intro Para style look funny? If 
you clicked the Automatically Update check box in the New Style dialog box 
when you created the style, all you have to do is alter a paragraph to which 
you assigned the Intro Para style to alter all 35 introductory paragraphs. 
However, if you decided against updating styles automatically, you can still 
change the introductory paragraphs throughout your document.
Follow these steps to modify a style that isn’t updated automatically:
 
1. Click in any paragraph, table, or list to which you’ve assigned the 
style; if you want to modify a character style, select the characters to 
which you’ve assigned the style.
 
2. In the Styles pane or Apply Styles task pane, make sure that the name 
of the style you want to modify is selected.
 
 If the right name isn’t selected, select it now in the Styles pane or Apply 
Styles task pane.
 
3. In the Styles pane, open the style’s drop-down list and choose Modify; 
in the Apply Styles task pane, click the Modify button.
 
 You see the Modify Style dialog box. Does the dialog box look familiar? It 
is nearly identical to the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box you 
used to create the style in the first place (refer to Figure 3-4). The only dif-
ference is that you can’t choose a style type in the Modify Style dialog box.
 
4. Change the settings in the Modify Styles dialog box and click OK.
 
 The previous section in this chapter explains the settings.

222
Creating and Managing Templates
After you modify a style, all paragraphs or text to which the style was 
assigned are instantly changed. You don’t have to go back and reformat text 
and paragraphs throughout your document.
Creating and Managing Templates
As I explain at the start of this chapter, every document you create is 
fashioned from a template. The purpose of a template is to store styles for 
documents. In the act of creating a document, you choose a template, and 
the styles on the template become available to you when you work on your 
document (Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains how to choose a template 
when you create a new document).
For example, when you double-click the Blank Template icon in the Available 
Templates window or press Ctrl+N, you create a document with the Blank 
Document template, a relatively simple template with few styles. When you 
create a document with a template from Office.com or a template from the 
New dialog box, more styles are available to you because these templates 
are more sophisticated.
To save time formatting your documents, you are invited to create templates 
with styles that you know and love. You can create a new template from 
scratch, create a template from a document, or create a template by assem-
bling styles from other templates and documents. Styles in templates, like 
styles in documents, can be modified, deleted, and renamed.
Creating a new template
How do you want to create a new template? You can do it from scratch, 
create a new template from a document, or assemble styles from other tem-
plates. Read on.
 
To create a document from a template you created yourself, open the 
Available Templates window (on the File tab, choose New) and click the My 
Templates icon. The New dialog box opens. Select your template and click 
the Open button.
Creating a template from scratch
Follow these steps to create a template from scratch:
 
1. On the File tab, choose New.
 
 The Available Templates window opens.

2. Click the My Templates icon to open the New dialog box.
 
3. Select the Blank Document icon.
 
4. Select the Template option button.
 
 This option button is located in the lower-right corner of the dialog box.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Your template appears in the Word window.
Create, modify, and delete styles as necessary (see “Creating a New Style” 
and “Modifying a Style,” earlier in this chapter). Click the Save button to save 
your template, and in the Save As dialog box, enter a name for the template 
and click the Save button.
Creating a template from a document
If a document has all or most of the styles you want for a template, convert 
the document into a template so that you can use the styles in documents 
you create in the future. Follow these steps to create a Word template from a 
Word document:
 
1. Open the Word document you will use to create a template.
 
2. On the File tab, choose Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for your template.
 
4. Open the Save As Type menu and choose Word Template.
 
5. Under Favorite Links, click Templates to see the folder where tem-
plates are stored.
 
6. Click the Save button.
Probably your new template includes text that it inherited from the docu-
ment it was created from. Delete the text (unless you want it to appear in 
documents you create from your new template).
Assembling styles from other documents and templates
The third way to create a new template is to create a template from scratch 
and then gather styles from other documents and templates in your new 
template. Later in this chapter, “Copying styles from different documents 
and templates” explains how to assemble styles into a template.

224
Creating and Managing Templates
Opening a template so that you can modify it
Open a template the same way you open a document. On the File tab, choose 
Open. You see the Open dialog box. Under Favorite Links, click Templates 
and then double-click the name of the template. It opens in the Word 
window. Style modifications you make in the template become available to 
all documents that were fashioned from the template.
Copying styles from different 
documents and templates
Suppose that you like a style in one document and you want to copy it to 
another so that you can use it there. Or you want to copy it to a template to 
make it available to documents created with the template. Read on to find 
out how to copy styles between documents and between templates.
Copying a style from one document to another
Copy a style from one document to another when you need the style on a 
one-time basis. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select a paragraph that was assigned the style you want to copy.
Templates are stored in the Templates folder. 
To copy, move, or send templates, and to trade 
styles between templates, you have to know 
where the Templates folder is located on your 
computer. Where templates are stored by 
default depends on which version of Windows 
your computer runs:
 ✓ Windows 7 and Windows Vista: C:\Users\
Username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Templates folder.
 ✓ Windows XP: C:\Documents and 
S e t t i n g s \ U s e r n a m e \
Application Data\Microsoft\
Templates folder.
If you’re having trouble finding the Templates 
folder, you can find out where it is located with 
these techniques:
 ✓ On the File tab, choose Options. In the Word 
Options dialog box, go to the Advanced 
Category and scroll to the File Locations 
button. Clicking this button opens the File 
Locations dialog box, where, under User 
Templates, you can see the name of the 
folder in which your templates are stored.
 ✓ On the File tab, choose New. In the 
Available Templates window, click the 
My Templates icon. The New dialog 
box appears. Right-click a template and 
choose Properties. The Properties dialog 
box lists the location of the folder where 
the templates are stored.

 Be sure to select the entire paragraph. If you want to copy a character 
style, select text to which you have assigned the character style.
 
2. Press Ctrl+C or right-click and choose Copy to copy the paragraph to 
the Clipboard.
 
3. Switch to the document you want to copy the style to and press Ctrl+V 
or click the Paste button on the Home tab.
 
4. Delete the text you just copied to your document.
 
 The style remains in the Styles pane and Quick Style gallery even though 
the text is deleted. You can call upon the style whenever you need it.
Copying styles to a template
Use the Organizer to copy styles from a document to a template or from one 
template to another. After making a style a part of a template, you can call 
upon the style in other documents. You can call upon it in each document 
you create or created with the template. Follow these steps to copy a style 
into a template:
 
1. Open the document or template with the styles you want to copy.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Opening a template so that you can modify it” 
explains how to open a template.
 
 2. In the Styles pane, click the Manage Styles button.
 
 This button is located at the bottom of the window. The Manage Styles 
dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Import/Export button.
 
 You see the Organizer dialog box shown in Figure 3-5. Styles in the docu-
ment or template that you opened in Step 1 appear in the In list box on 
the left side.

of the Organizer dialog box.
 
6. In the Organizer dialog box, Ctrl+click to select the names of styles on 
the left side of the dialog box that you want to copy to the template 
listed on the right side of the dialog box.
 
 As you click the names, they become highlighted.
 
7. Click the Copy button.
 
 The names of styles that you copied appear on the right side of the 
Organizer dialog box.
 
8. Click the Close button and click Save when Word asks whether you 
want to save the new styles in the template.
It happens in the best of families. You create 
or are given a document only to discover that 
the wrong template is attached to it. For times 
like those, Word gives you the opportunity to 
switch templates. Follow these steps:
 1. On the Developer tab, click the Document 
Template button.
 
 You see the Templates and Add-Ins dialog 
box. If the Developer tab isn’t displayed 
on your screen, go to the File tab, choose

gory in the Word Options dialog box, select 
the Developer check box, and click OK.
 2. Click the Attach button to open the Attach 
Template dialog box.
 3. Find and select the template you want and 
click the Open button.
 
 You return to the Templates and Add-ins 
dialog box, where the name of the tem-
plate you chose appears in the Document 
Template box.
 4. Click the Automatically Update Document 
Styles check box.
 
 Doing so tells Word to apply the styles from 
the new template to your document.
 5. Click OK.

ter). However, in the Modify Style dialog box, select the New Documents 
Based on This Template option button before clicking OK.
Your style modifications will apply to all documents you create in the future 
with your template. For the style modifications to take effect in documents 
you already created with your template, tell Word to automatically update 
document styles in those documents. Follow these steps:
 
1. Save and close your template if it is still open.
 
 If any documents you fashioned from the template are open, close them.
 
2. Open a document that you want to update with the style modifications 
you made to the template.

In This Chapter
✓ Considering ways to desktop-publish in Word
✓ Fine-tuning tables
✓ Wrapping text around graphics and other objects
✓ Running text in newspaper-style columns
✓ Putting text boxes in documents
✓ Putting borders on pages
✓ Decorating pages with drop caps and watermarks
✓ Printing landscape documents and on varying sizes of paper
O
nce upon a time, word processors were nothing more than glorified 
typewriters. They were good for typing and basic formatting, and not 
much else. But over the years, Microsoft Word has become a desktop pub-
lishing program in its own right. This chapter explains a few desktop publish-
ing features that can make your documents stand out in the crowd — columns, 
text boxes, page borders, watermarks, and drop caps, to name a few.
Making Use of Charts, Diagrams, 
Shapes, Clip Art, and Photos 
Figure 4-1 shows a newsletter that includes a chart, diagram, shape, clip-
art image, and photo. You are invited to include these items in your Word 
documents, and you’ll be glad to know that including them isn’t very much 
trouble. 
 
 
✦ Charts: A chart is an excellent way to present data for comparison pur-
poses. The pie slices, bars, columns, or lines tell readers right away 
which business is more productive, for example, or who received the 
most votes. Book I, Chapter 6 explains how to create charts.

✦ Diagrams: A diagram allows readers to quickly grasp an idea, relation-
ship, or concept. Instead of explaining an abstract idea, you can portray 
it in a diagram. Book I, Chapter 7 explains diagrams.
 
 
✦ Shapes and lines: Shapes and lines can also illustrate ideas and con-
cepts. You can also use them for decorative purposes in Word docu-
ments. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to draw lines, arrows, and shapes.
 
 
✦ Clip-art images: Clip-art images make a document livelier. They add a 
little color to documents. Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains how to place clip-
art images in documents.
 
 
✦ Photos: A well-placed photo or two can make a newsletter or brochure 
that much more attractive. Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains how to include 
photos in Word documents.
Constructing the Perfect Table
Create a table to present raw data to your readers or plead your case with 
numbers and facts. Provided the row labels and column headings are 
descriptive, looking up information in a table is the easiest way to find it. 
And tables impose order on chaos. What used to be a knotty lump of nonde-
script data can be turned into an orderly statement of fact if the data is pre-
sented in a table. No report is complete without one or two of them.

231
Constructing the Perfect Table
 
 Book I, Chapter 5 explains how to create a table, as well as how to include 
mathematical calculations in Word tables. These pages explain a few table 
techniques that pertain strictly to Word documents — repeating the heading 
rows, fitting a table on a single page, and turning a list into a table.
Repeating heading rows on subsequent pages
 
Making sure that the heading row, sometimes called the header row, appears 
on a new page if the table breaks across pages is essential. The heading row 
Ideally, a table should fit on a single page, 
because studying table data that is spread 
across two or more pages can be difficult. Here 
are some suggestions for fitting a table on a 
single page:
 ✓ Present the table in landscape mode. In 
Landscape mode, a page is turned on its 
ear so that it is wider than it is tall and 
you have room for more columns. To print 
in Landscape mode, however, you must 
create a new section for the pages in 
question. Later in this chapter, “Landscape 
Documents” explains how to switch from 
portrait to landscape mode.
 ✓ Shrink the font size. Sometimes shrinking 
the font size throughout a table shrinks 
the table just enough to fit it on a page. To 
shrink fonts throughout a table, go to the 
Home tab and click the Shrink Font button 
(or press Ctrl+[). Keep shrinking the font 
size until the table fits on one page. 
 ✓ Shrink the columns. On the (Table Tools) 
Layout tab, click the AutoFit button, and 
choose AutoFit Contents on the drop-down 
list to make each column only wide enough 
to accommodate its widest entry.
 ✓ Change the orientation of heading row 
text. In a top-heavy table in which the 
heading row cells contain text and the cells 
below contain numbers, you can make the 
entire table narrower by changing the ori-
entation of the text in the heading row. To 
turn text on its ear, select the cells whose 
text needs a turn, go to the (Table Tools) 
Layout tab, and click the Text Direction 
button. Keep clicking until the text turns 
the direction you want.
Chances are, if your table can’t fit on one page, 
presenting the information in a table isn’t the best 
option. Try presenting it in bulleted or numbered 
lists. Or present the information in short para-
graphs under small fourth- or fifth-level headings.
Fitting a table on the page

232
Constructing the Perfect Table
is the first row in the table, the one that usually describes what is in the 
columns below. Without a heading row, readers can’t tell what the informa-
tion in a table means. Follow these steps to make the heading row (or rows) 
repeat on the top of each new page that a table appears on:
 
1. Place the cursor in the heading row or select the heading rows if your 
tables includes more than one heading row.
 
 2. On the (Table Tools) Layout tab, click the Repeat Header Rows button 
(depending on the size of your screen, you may have to click the Data 
button first).
 
 Heading rows appear only in Print Layout view, so don’t worry if you 
can’t see them in Draft view.
Turning a list into a table
In order to turn a list into a table, all components of the list — each name, 
address, city name, state, and zip code listing, for example — must be sepa-
rated from the next component by a tab space or a comma. Word looks for 
tab spaces or commas when it turns a list into a table, and the program 
separates data into columns according to where the tab spaces or commas 
are located. You have to prepare your list carefully by entering tab spaces or 
commas in all the right places before you can turn a list into a table.
Follow these steps to turn a list into a table after you’ve done all the prelimi-
nary work:
 
1. Select the list.
 
 2. On the Insert tab, click the Table button and choose Convert Text To 
Table on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Convert Text to Table dialog box.
 
 Note the number in the Number of Columns box. It should list the 
number of components into which you separated your list. If the number 
doesn’t match the number of components, you misplaced a tab entry 
or comma in your list. Click Cancel, return to your list, and examine it 
to make sure that each line has been divided into the same number of 
components. 
 
3. Under Separate Text At, choose the Tabs or Commas option, depend-
ing on which you used to separate the components on the list.
 
4. Click OK.
You can turn a table into a list by clicking the Convert to Text button on 
the (Table Tools) Layout tab (you may have to click the Data button first, 
depending on the size of your screen).

Positioning and Wrapping Objects Relative to the Page and Text
Positioning and Wrapping Objects 
Relative to the Page and Text
“Object” is just Office’s generic term for a shape, line, text box, clip-art 
image, photo, diagram, WordArt image, or chart that you insert in a docu-
ment. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate an object — how to 
change its size, shape, and other qualities. When you place an object in a 
Word document, you have to consider more than its size and shape. You 
also have to consider where to position it on the page and how to wrap text 
around it. In Word lingo, wrap refers to what text does when it butts heads 
with a shape, text box, photo, diagram, or other object. You must be in Print 
Layout view to wrap and position objects on a page.
 
When you insert an object, it lands inline with text. That means it lands 
against the left margin and text doesn’t wrap around its side. Before you can 
change the position of an object, you must select it and choose a text-wrap-
ping option apart from Inline with Text.
You can decide for yourself how close or far text 
is from an object when you wrap text. Select the 
object, and on the Format tab, click the Wrap 
Text button and choose Edit Wrap Points on the 
drop-down list. Small black squares called wrap 
points appear around the object. Click and drag 
the wrap points to push text away from or bring 
text closer to the object in question.

Wrapping text around an object
Figure 4-2 shows the 15 different ways you can wrap text around an object. 
Select the object you want to wrap text around, go to the Format tab, and 
use one of these techniques to wrap text around the object:
 
 
✦ Click the Wrap Text button and choose an option on the drop-down list. 
(You may have to click the Arrange button first, depending on the size of 
your screen.)
 
✦ Click the Wrap Text button and choose More Layout Options on the 
drop-down list, or click the Size group button and select the Text 
Wrapping tab in the Layout dialog box. Then choose a wrapping style 
and side around which to wrap text. Figure 4-2 shows what the different 
combinations of Wrapping Style and Wrap Text options do.
 
Wrapped text looks best when it is justified and hyphenated. That way, text 
can get closer to the object that is being wrapped.

to wrap text 
in a Word 
document.
 
Positioning an object on a page
To position an object in a Word page, you can drag it to a new location. As 
Book I, Chapter 8 explains in torturous detail, dragging means to select the 
object, move the pointer over its perimeter, click when you see the four-
headed arrow, and slide the object to a new location.
To make positioning objects on a page a little easier, Word also offers 
Position commands for moving objects. Select your object, go to the Format

Positioning and Wrapping Objects Relative to the Page and Text
tab, and use one of these techniques to move your object precisely into 
place:
 
 
✦ Click the Position button and select a With Text Wrapping option on 
the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-3. (You may have to click the 
Arrange button first, depending on the size of your screen.) These 
options position an object squarely in a corner, a side, or the middle of 
the page. 
 
✦ Click the Position button and choose More Layout Options on the drop-
down list, or click the Size group button and select the Position tab in 
the Layout dialog box. Then choose position options. Go to the Layout 
dialog box when you want to place objects in the very same position on 
different pages.

options

object in 
one part of 
the page.
 
Select the object
Choose a With Text Wrapping option
 
An object you position with an option on the Position drop-down list trav-
els from page to page if you move the paragraph to which it’s connected. 
This happens because, when you insert an object, Word attaches it to the 
paragraph where the cursor is located when you make the insertion. If you 
move that paragraph to another page or the paragraph gets moved as you 
edit text, the object moves right along with the paragraph. You can locate 
the paragraph to which an object is connected by clicking the Show/Hide¶ 
button on the Home tab and then clicking the object; the anchor symbol 
appears beside the paragraph that the object is connected to.

Working with the Drawing Canvas
Working with the Drawing Canvas
As Book I, Chapter 8 explains, shapes and lines are a great way to illustrate 
ideas. You can in effect doodle on the page and give readers another insight 
into what you want to explain. In Word, however, drawing lines and shapes 
is problematic unless you draw them on the drawing canvas.
The drawing canvas works like a corral to hold lines and shapes. After you 
create a drawing canvas, you can draw inside it as though you were drawing 
on a little page, as shown in Figure 4-4. You can treat the drawing canvas as 
an object in its own right. You can move it, along with the things inside it, to 
new locations. You can also, by way of the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, give 
the drawing canvas an outline shape and fill color. The drawing canvas makes 
working with objects on a page, especially lines and shapes, that much easier.
 
Figure 4-4: 
The drawing 
canvas — 
a corral 
for shapes 
and lines.
 
Follow these steps to create a drawing canvas for holding lines and shapes:
 
1. Place the cursor roughly where you want the drawing canvas to be.
 
2. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 3. Click the Shapes button and choose New Drawing Canvas.
 
 You can find the New Drawing Canvas command at the bottom of the 
Shapes drop-down list. A drawing canvas appears on your screen.
 
The drawing canvas is an object in its own right. You can wrap text around 
it, give it an outline, and give it a color fill. You can drag it to a new location. 
To change its size, drag a handle on the side or corner.

Putting Newspaper-Style Columns in a Document
Choosing a Theme for Your Document
When you installed Word on your computer, you also installed a dozen or 
more themes. A theme is a colorful, ready-made design for headings and 
text. Each theme imposes a slightly different look on a document. If you want 
to experiment with themes, more power to you, but be prepared to click the 
Undo button and backtrack as you rummage around for the right one.
Staring on the Page Layout tab, follow these instructions to experiment with 
themes:
 
 
✦ Choosing a new theme: Click the Themes button and choose a theme on 
the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Choosing a new set of colors for your theme: Click the Theme Colors 
button, slide the pointer over the different color sets on the drop-down 
list, and see what effect they have on your document.
 
 
✦ Changing the fonts: Click the Theme Fonts button and choose a combi-
nation of fonts on the drop-down list for the headings and text in your 
document.
 
 
✦ Changing theme effects: Click the Theme Effects button and choose a 
theme effect on the drop-down list. A theme effect is a slight refinement 
to a theme.
Putting Newspaper-Style Columns in a Document
Columns look great in newsletters and similar documents. And you can pack 
a lot of words in columns. I should warn you, however, that the Columns 
command is only good for creating columns that appear on the same page. 
Running text to the next page with the Columns command can be prob-
lematic. If you’re serious about running text in columns, I suggest either 
constructing the columns from text boxes or using Publisher, another Office 
program. Book VII explains Publisher.
 
Sometimes it is easier to create columns by creating a table or by using text 
boxes, especially when the columns refer to one another. In a two-column 
résumé, for example, the left-hand column often lists job titles (“Facsimile 
Engineer”) whose descriptions are found directly across the page in the 
right-hand column (“I Xeroxed stuff all day long”). Creating a two-column 
résumé with Word’s Columns command would be futile because making the 
columns line up is nearly impossible. Each time you add something to the 
left-hand column, everything snakes — it gets bumped down in the left-hand 
column and the right-hand column as well.

238
Putting Newspaper-Style Columns in a Document
Doing the preliminary work
 
Before you put text in newspaper-style columns, write it. Take care of the 
spelling, grammar, and everything else first because making text changes to 
words after they’ve been arranged in columns is difficult. Columns appear 
only in Print Layout view.
Running text into columns
 
 To “columunize” text, select it, go to the Page Layout tab, and click the 
Columns button. Then either choose how many columns you want on the 
drop-down list or choose More Columns to create columns of different 
widths.
You see the Columns dialog box shown in Figure 4-5 if you choose More 
Columns. Here are the options in the Columns dialog box:
 
✦ Preset columns: Select a Presets box to choose a preset number 
of columns. Notice that, in some of the boxes, the columns aren’t of 
equal width. 
 
Figure 4-5: 
Running text 
in columns.
 
 
✦ Number of columns: If a preset column doesn’t do the trick, enter the 
number of columns you want in the Number of Columns box.
 
✦ Line between columns: A line between columns is mighty elegant and 
is difficult to do on your own. Select the Line Between check box to run 
lines between columns.
 
✦ Columns width: If you deselect the Equal Column Width check box, you 
can make columns of unequal width. Change the width of each column 
by using the Width boxes.
 
✦ Space between columns: Enter a measurement in the Spacing boxes to 
determine how much space appears between columns.

Book II

Working with Text Boxes
 
✦ Start New Column: This check box is for putting empty space in a 
column, perhaps to insert a text box or picture. Place the cursor where 
you want the empty space to begin, choose This Point Forward on the 
Apply To drop-down list, and select the Start New Column check box.
Word creates a new section if you selected text before you columnized it, 
and you see your columns in Print Layout view. Chapter 2 of this mini-book 
explains sections.
 
To ”break” a column in the middle and move text to the next column, click where 
you want the column to break and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter or go to the Page 
Layout tab, click the Breaks button, and choose Column on the drop-down list.
Working with Text Boxes
Put text in a text box when you want a notice or announcement to stand 
out on the page. Like other objects, text boxes can be shaded, filled with color, 
and given borders, as the examples in Figure 4-6 demonstrate. You can also lay 
them over graphics to make for interesting effects. I removed the borders and 
the fill color from the text box on the right side of Figure 4-6, but rest assured, 
the text in this figure lies squarely in a text box. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how 
to give borders, shading, and color to objects such as text boxes.)
 
Figure 4-6: 
Examples of 
text boxes.
 
You can move a text box around at will on the page until it lands in the right 
place. You can even use text boxes as columns and make text jump from one 
text box to the next in a document — a nice feature, for example, when you 
want a newsletter article on page 1 to be continued on page 2. Instead of cut-
ting and pasting text from page 1 to page 2, Word moves the text for you as 
the column on page 1 fills up. 
Inserting a text box
 
 To create a text box, go to the Insert tab, click the Text Box button, and use 
one of these techniques:

240
Sprucing Up Your Pages
 
✦ Choose a ready-made text box: Scroll in the drop-down list and choose 
a preformatted text box.
 
✦ Draw a conventional text box: Choose Draw Text Box on the drop-down 
list, and then click and drag to draw the text box. Lines show you how 
big it will be when you release the mouse button.
After you insert the text box, you can type text in it and call on all the for-
matting commands on the (Drawing) Format tab. These commands are 
explained in Book I, Chapter 8. It also describes how to turn a shape such 
as a circle or triangle into a text box (create the shape, right-click it, choose 
Add Text, and start typing).
 
Here’s a neat trick: You can turn the text in a text box on its side so that it 
reads from top to bottom or bottom to top, not from left to right. Create a 
text box, enter the text, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Text 
Direction button, and choose a Rotate option on the drop-down list.
Making text flow from text box to text box
As I mention earlier, you can link text boxes so that the text in the first box 
is pushed into the next one when it fills up. To link text boxes, start by creat-
ing all the text boxes that you need. You cannot link one text box to another 
if the second text box already has text in it. Starting on the (Drawing Tools) 
Format tab, follow these directions to link text boxes:
 
 ✦ Creating a forward link: Click a text box and then click the Create Link 
button to create a forward link. The pointer changes into a very odd-looking 
pointer that is supposed to look like a pitcher. Move the odd-looking 
pointer to the next text box in the chain and click there to create a link.
 
 ✦ Breaking a link: To break a link, click the text box that is to be the last 
in the chain, and then click the Break Link button.
Sprucing Up Your Pages
You can play interior decorator with the pages of a document by putting a 
border around pages, splashing color on pages, and taking advantage of the 
predesigned cover pages that Word provides for you. Keep reading if making 
the pages of your document a little prettier interests you.
Decorating a page with a border
Word offers a means of decorating title pages, certificates, menus, and simi-
lar documents with a page border. Besides lines, you can decorate the sides 

Book II
Chapter 4
Desktop Publishing 
with Word
241
Sprucing Up Your Pages
of a page with stars, pieces of cake, and other artwork. If you want to place 
a border around a page in the middle of a document, you must create a sec-
tion break where the page is.
Before you create your border, place the cursor on the page where the 
border is to appear. Place the cursor on the first page of a document if you 
want to put a border around only the first page. If your document is divided 
into sections and you want to put borders around certain pages in a section, 
place the cursor in the section — either in the first page if you want the bor-
ders to go around it, or in a subsequent page.
With the cursor in the right place, follow these steps to decorate your page 
or pages with a border:
 
 1. Go to the Page Layout tab and click the Page Borders button.
 
 You see the Borders and Shading dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Putting 
borders on 
pages.
 
 
2. Under Setting, choose which kind of border you want.
 
 The Custom setting is for putting borders on one, two, or three sides of 
the page, not four. Use the None setting to remove borders.
 
3. On the Apply To drop-down list, tell Word which page or pages in the 
document get borders.
 
4. Select options to construct the border you want and then click OK.

242
Sprucing Up Your Pages
The Page Border tab offers a bunch of tools for fashioning a border:
 
✦ Line for borders: Under Style, scroll down the list and choose a line for 
the borders. You will find interesting choices at the bottom of the menu. 
Be sure to look in the Preview window to see what your choices in this 
dialog box add up to.
 
✦ Color for borders: Open the Color drop-down list and choose a color for 
the border lines if you want a color border.
 
✦ Width of borders: If you chose artwork for the borders, use the Width 
drop-down list to tell Word how wide the lines or artwork should be.
 
✦ Artwork for borders: Open the Art drop-down list and choose a symbol, 
illustration, star, piece of cake, or other artwork, if that is what you want 
for the borders. You will find some amusing choices on this long list, 
including ice cream cones, bats, and umbrellas.
 
✦ Borders on different sides of the page: Use the four buttons in the 
Preview window to tell Word on which sides of the page to draw bor-
ders. Click these buttons to remove or add borders, as you want.
 
✦ Distance from edge of page: Click the Options button and fill in the 
Border and Shading Options dialog box if you want to get specific about 
how close the borders can come to the edge of the page or pages.
Putting a background color on pages
Especially if you intend to save your Word document as a Web page, you will 
be glad to know that putting a background color on pages is easy. You can’t, 
however, pick and choose which pages get a background color. Putting back-
ground colors on the pages of a document is an all-or-nothing proposition.
 
 To grace a page with a background color or gradient color mixture, go to the 
Page Layout tab, click the Page Color button, and choose a color on the 
drop-down list. Choose Fill Effects to open the Fill Effects dialog box and 
apply gradient color mixtures or patterns to the pages.
Getting Word’s help with cover letters
 
 Writing and designing a cover page for a letter or report is a chore. Word 
can’t dictate a cover page for you, but it can provide a handsome preformat-
ted cover page that looks nice at the front of a report or article. To place a 
cover page at the start of a document, go to the Insert tab, click the Cover 
Page button, and choose a cover page predesign.

Dropping In a Drop Cap
Dropping In a Drop Cap
A drop cap is a large capital letter that “drops” into the text, as shown in 
Figure 4-8. Drop caps appear at the start of chapters in many books, this 
book included, and you can find other uses for them, too. In Figure 4-8, one 
drop cap marks the A side of a list of songs on a homemade music CD.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Creating a 
drop cap.
 
 
 To create a drop cap, start by clicking anywhere in the paragraph whose 
first letter you want to ”drop.” If you want to “drop” more than one charac-
ter at the start of the paragraph, select the characters. Then go to the Insert 
tab, click the Drop Cap button, and choose Dropped or Drop Cap Options. 
Choosing Drop Cap Options opens the Drop Cap dialog box shown in Figure 
4-8, where you can experiment with these options:
 
✦ Position: Choose which kind of drop cap you want. In Margin places the 
drop cap to the left of the paragraph, in the margin, not in the paragraph 
itself.
 
✦ Font: Choose a font from the Font drop-down list. Choose a different font 
from the text in the paragraph.
 
✦ Lines to Drop: Enter the number of text lines to drop the letter.
 
✦ Distance from Text: Keep the 0 setting unless you’re dropping an I, 1, or 
other skinny letter or number.
Click the Drop Cap button and choose None to remove a drop cap.

Watermarking for the Elegant Effect
Watermarking for the Elegant Effect
A watermark is a pale image or set of words that appears behind text on each 
page in a document. True watermarks are made in the paper mold and can 
be seen only when the sheet of paper is held up to a light. You can’t make 
true watermarks with Word, but you can make the closest thing to them 
that can be attained in the debased digital world in which we live. Figure 
4-9 shows two pages of a letter in which the paper has been “watermarked.” 
Watermarks are one of the easiest formatting tricks to accomplish in Word.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Watermarks 
showing 
faintly on 
the page.
 
 
 To create a watermark for every page of a document, go to the Page Layout 
tab and click the Watermark button. From the drop-down list, create your 
watermark:
 
✦ Prefabricated text watermark: Scroll down the list and choose an option. 
You will find “Confidential,” “Urgent,” and other text watermarks.
 
✦ Picture watermark: Choose Custom Watermark, and in the Printed 
Watermark dialog box, click the Picture Watermark option button. Then 
click the Select Picture button. In the Insert Picture dialog box, select a 
graphic file to use for the watermark and click the Insert button. Back 
in the Printed Watermark dialog box, choose or enter a size for the 
graphic on the Scale drop-down list. I don’t recommend deselecting 
the Washout check box — do so and your image may be so dark that it 
obscures the text.
 
✦ Text watermark: Choose Custom Watermark and, in the Printed 
Watermark dialog box, click the Text Watermark option button. Type 
a word or two in the Text box (or choose an entry from the drop-down 
list). Choose a font, size, color, and layout for the words. If you deselect 
the Semitransparent check box, you do so at your peril because the 
watermark words may be too dark on the page.

Landscape Documents
A landscape document is one in which the page is wider than it is long, like a 
painting of a landscape, as shown on the right side of Figure 4-10. Most docu-
ments, like the pages of this book, are printed in portrait style, with the short 
sides of the page on the top and bottom. However, creating a landscape doc-
ument is sometimes a good idea because a landscape document stands out 
from the usual crowd of portrait documents and sometimes printing in land-
scape mode is necessary to fit text, tables, and graphics on a single page. 
 
Figure 4-10: 
A portrait 
document 
(left) and 
landscape 
document 
(right).
 
You’re ready to go if you want to turn all the pages in your document into 
landscape pages. To turn some of the pages into landscape pages, create a 
section for the pages that need to appear in Landscape mode and click in the 
section (Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains sections). Starting on the Page 
Layout tab, use these techniques to change the page orientation:
 
 
✦ Landscape pages: Click the Orientation button and choose Landscape 
on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Portrait pages: Click the Orientation button and choose Portrait on the 
drop-down list.
Printing on Different Sizes of Paper
You don’t have to print exclusively on standard 8.5-x-11 paper; you can print 
on legal-size paper and other sizes of paper as well. A newsletter with an 

246

unusual shape really stands out in a crowd and gets people’s attention. Go 
to the Page Layout tab and use one of these techniques to change the size of 
the paper on which you intend to print a document:
 
 
✦ Click the Size button and choose an option on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Click the Page Setup group button, select the Paper tab in the Page 
Setup dialog box, and choose a setting on the Paper Size drop-down list. 
If none of the settings suits you, enter your own settings in the Width 
and Height text boxes.

Chapter 5: Getting Word’s 
Help with Office Chores
In This Chapter
✓ Marking text with highlighting
✓ Commenting on others’ work
✓ Tracking revisions to documents
✓ Printing envelopes and labels
✓ Mail merging for form letters and bulk mailing
T
his chapter is dedicated to the proposition that everyone should get 
their work done sooner. It explains how Word can be a help in the 
office, especially when it comes to working on team projects. This chapter 
explains comments, using revision marks to record edits, and mail merging, 
which is Microsoft’s term for generating form letters, labels, and envelopes 
for mass mailings.
Highlighting Parts of a Document
In my work, I often use the Highlight command to mark paragraphs and text 
that need reviewing later. And on rainy days, I use it to splash color on my 
documents and keep myself amused. Whatever your reasons for highlight-
ing text in a document, go to the Home tab and use one of these techniques 
to do it:
 
 
✦ Select text and then choose a highlighter: Select the text you want to 
highlight and then either click the Text Highlight Color button (if it’s dis-
playing your color choice) or open the drop-down list on the button and 
choose a color.
 
✦ Choose a highlighter and then select text: Either click the Text Highlight 
Color button (if it’s already displaying your color choice) or open the 
drop-down list on the button and choose a color. The pointer changes 
into a crayon. Drag across the text you want to highlight. When you finish 
highlighting, click the Text Highlight Color button again or press Esc.
To remove highlights, select the highlighted text, open the drop-down list 
on the Text Highlight Color button, and choose No Color. Select the entire 
document (press Ctrl+A) and choose No Color to remove all highlights from 
a document.

248
Commenting on a Document
Highlight marks are printed along with the text. To keep highlights from 
being printed, go to the File tab, choose Options, click the Display category 
in the Word Options dialog box, and deselect the Show Highlighter Marks 
check box.
Commenting on a Document
In the old days, comments were scribbled illegibly in the margins of books 
and documents, but in Word, comments are easy to read. To show where a 
comment has been made on the text, Word puts brackets around text and 
highlights the text. Each commenter is assigned a different highlighting color 
so that you can tell at a glance who made each comment. As shown in Figure 
5-1, you can read comments in the Reviewing pane, in pop-up boxes (in 
Draft view and Outline view), and in balloons (in Print Layout view and Web 
Layout view).
 
Figure 5-1:

right) the

Entering a comment
If you’re putting together a proposal, you can pass it around the office and 
invite everyone to comment. If someone makes an especially good comment, 
you can include it in the main text merely by copying and pasting it. To write 
a comment:
 
1. Select the word or sentence that you want to comment on.
 
 2. On the Review tab, click the New Comment button.
 
 In Draft and Outline view, the Reviewing pane opens on the left side or 
bottom of the screen so that you can enter a comment; in Print Layout 
and Web Layout view, a new balloon appears on the right side of the

screen so that you can enter a comment. (On the Review tab, open the 
drop-down list on the Reviewing Pane button and choose an option to 
place the pane on the left side or bottom of the screen.)
 
3. Type your comment in the space provided.
 
 In Draft and Outline view, commenters’ names and initials appear beside 
each comment and comments are numbered. If the wrong name and 
initials appear beside your comments, open the drop-down list on the 
Track Changes button, choose Change User Name, and enter your cor-
rect name and initials in the Word Options dialog box.
Caring for and feeding comments
Starting on the Review tab, here is a handful of tasks that deserve comment 
(if you’ll pardon my little pun):
 
✦ Editing a comment: Right-click between the brackets and choose Edit 
Comment or just click in the Reviewing pane in Print Layout view. Then 
rewrite the comment in the Reviewing pane or the balloon.
 
 
✦ Going from comment to comment: Click the Previous or Next button 
on the Review tab. In Draft and Outline view, the Reviewing pane opens, 
and you can read the comment you landed on at the top of the pane. 
In Print Layout and Web Layout view, balloons on the right side of the 
screen are highlighted as you go from comment to comment.
 
 
✦ Seeing and hiding the Reviewing pane: Click the Reviewing Pane button 
to display or hide the Reviewing pane. On the button’s drop-down list, 
choose an option to put the pane on the left side or bottom of the screen.
 
 
✦ Temporarily removing the comments: Click the Show Markup button 
and deselect Comments on the drop-down list to wipe away the com-
ments; select Comments to see them again.
 
✦ Displaying comments by a particular reviewer: Click the Show Markup 
button, choose Reviewers, and deselect All Reviewers on the submenu. 
Then click the button again, choose Reviewers, and choose the name of 
a reviewer. To see all comments again, click the Show Markup button 
and choose Reviewers➪All Reviewers.
 
 
✦ Deleting a comment: Click a comment in the Reviewing pane, click 
between brackets, or click a comment balloon and then click the Delete 
button. You can also right-click and choose Delete Comment.
 
✦ Deleting all the comments in the document: Open the drop-down list 
on the Delete button and choose Delete All Comments in Document.
 
✦ Deleting comments made by one or two people: First, isolate com-
ments made by people whose comments you want to delete (see 
“Displaying comments by a particular reviewer” earlier in this list). Then 
open the drop-down list on the Delete button and choose Delete All 
Comments Shown.

Tracking Changes to Documents
Tracking Changes to Documents
When many hands go into revising a document, figuring out who made 
changes to what is impossible. What’s more, it’s impossible to tell what the 
first draft looked like. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether the changes were 
for good or ill. To help you keep track of changes to documents, Word offers 
the Track Changes command. When this command is in effect:
 
✦ All changes to a document are recorded in a different color, with one 
color for each reviewer.
 
✦ In Draft and Outline view, new text is underlined and deleted text is 
crossed out.
 
✦ In Print Layout and Web Layout view, new text is underlined, and 
deleted text appears in balloons on the right side of the window.
 
✦ In all views, a vertical line appears on the left side of the screen to indi-
cate where changes were made.
By moving the pointer over a change, you can read the name of the person 
who made it as well as the words that were inserted or deleted. You can 
see changes as well in the Reviewing pane. As you review changes, you can 
accept or reject each change. You can also see the original document, a 
copy with revisions, or the final copy simply by making a choice from the 
Display for Review drop-down list on the Review tab.
To give you an idea of what tracking marks look like, Figure 5-2 shows the 
first two sentences of Vladimir Nabokov’s autobiography Speak, Memory in 
Draft view, with marks showing where additions were made and deletions 
scratched out.
Letting the air out of the balloons
In Print Layout and Web Layout view, com-
ments and revisions appear in balloons on the 
right side of the screen. Sometimes seeing 
revisions and comments in balloons is help-
ful; sometimes it’s hard to make sense of them 
when they’re so far to the side of the page.
To hide or display balloons in Print Layout 
and Web Layout view, you can click the 
Show Markup button on the Review tab, 
choose Balloons, and choose an option on the 
submenu:
 ✓ Show Revisions in Balloons displays the 
balloons.
 ✓ Show All Revisions Inline moves comments 
and revisions onto the page and effectively 
lets all the air out of the balloons.
 ✓ Show Only Comments and Formatting in 
Balloons shows comments only, not revi-
sion marks.

✦ On the Review tab, click the Track Changes button (or open its drop-
down list and choose Track Changes).
 
 
✦ Press Ctrl+Shift+E.
 
✦ On the status bar, click the words Track Changes so that the status bar 
reads “Track Changes: On.” If you don’t see the words Track Changes on 
your status bar and you want to see them there, right-click the status 
bar and select Track Changes on the pop-up menu.
To stop tracking changes to a document, click the Track Changes button 
again, press Ctrl+Shift+E again, or click the words Track Changes on the 
status bar so that the words read “Track Changes: Off.”
Telling Word how to mark changes
 
 To tell Word precisely how to mark changes, open the drop-down list on the 
Track Changes button (you may have to click the Tracking button first) and 
choose Change Tracking Options. You see the colorful Track Changes 
Options dialog box. It offers these options:
 
✦ Markup options: Declare how you want to mark insertions and dele-
tions, and with which color you want to mark them.
 
✦ Moves options: Declare how you want to mark text that has been cut 
and pasted.

252
Tracking Changes to Documents
 
✦ Table Cell Highlighting options: When editing tables, you can mark 
inserted, deleted, merged, and split cells in different colors.
 
✦ Formatting options: Choose an option to mark formatting changes as 
well as changes to text.
 
✦ Balloons: Choose Always if you prefer to mark deleted text with bal-
loons to the right of the text in Print Layout and Web Layout view. If you 
prefer not to see balloons in Print Layout and Web Layout view, choose 
Never. You must display the balloons to examine revised documents in 
Final Showing Markup and Original Showing Markup view (see “Marking 
changes when you forgot to turn on change marks” later in this chapter). 
Earlier in this chapter, the sidebar “Letting the air out of the balloons” 
explains how you can quickly hide or display balloons in Print Layout 
and Web Layout view.
 
If your name doesn’t appear with the change marks you make, go to the 
Review tab, open the drop-down list on the Track Changes button, choose 
Change User Name, and enter your name and initials in the Word Options 
dialog box.
Reading and reviewing a 
document with change marks
Reading and reviewing a document with change marks isn’t easy. The marks 
can get in the way. Fortunately, Word offers the Display for Review menu 
on the Review tab for dealing with documents that have been scarred by 
change marks. Choose options on the Display for Review drop-down list to 
get a better idea of how your changes are taking shape:
 
✦ See more clearly where text was deleted from the original document: 
Choose Final: Show Markup. In Print Layout view, deleted material 
appears in balloons on the right side of the screen and insertions are 
underlined.
 
✦ See what the document would look like if you accepted all changes: 
Choose Final. All change marks are stripped away and you see what your 
document would look like if you accepted all changes made to it.
 
✦ See more clearly where text was inserted in the document: Choose 
Original: Show Markup. In Print Layout view, insertions appear in bal-
loons on the right side of the screen and a line appears through text that 
has been deleted.
 
✦ See what the document would look like if you rejected all changes: 
Choose Original. You get the original, pristine document back.

Tracking Changes to Documents
Marking changes when you forgot 
to turn on change marks
Suppose that you write the first draft of a document and someone revises it 
but that someone doesn’t track changes. How can you tell where changes were 
made? For that matter, suppose that you get hold of a document, you change it 
around without tracking changes, and now you want to see what your editorial 
changes did to the original copy. I have good news: You can compare docu-
ments to see the editorial changes that were made to them. Word offers a com-
mand for comparing the original document to a revised edition and another 
for comparing two different revised editions of the same document.
After you make the comparison, Word creates a third document similar to 
the one shown in Figure 5-3. In the Source Document pane on the right side 
of the window, you can see the documents you’re comparing. The Compared 
Document pane, meanwhile, shows who made changes and what those 
changes are.
Follow these steps to compare an original document to its revised copy or 
two revised copies:
 
 1. On the Review tab, click the Compare button.
 
 
 You see a drop-down list (depending on the size of your screen, you may 
have to choose Compare more than once to get to the drop-down list).
 
2. On the drop-down list, choose Compare to compare the original docu-
ment to its revised edition; choose Combine to compare two editions 
of the same document that were revised separately.
 
 You see the Compare Documents dialog box or the Combine Documents 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-4. These dialog boxes work the same way.

changes.

3. On the Original Document drop-down list, choose the original or 
a revised edition of the document; if its name isn’t there, click the 
Browse button and select it in the Open dialog box.
 
4. On the Revised Document drop-down list, choose a revised copy, or 
else click the Browse button and select it in the Open dialog box.
 
5. Click the More button.
 
 You see more options for comparing or combining documents.
 
6. If you so desire, deselect the Comparison Settings check boxes to tell 
Word what you want to compare.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Word creates a new document that shows where changes were made to 
the original copy or where the revised copies differ (refer to Figure 5-3). 
You can save this document if you want to.
 
To help with document comparisons, you can tell Word what to display in 
the Source Documents pane on the right side of the screen. On the Review 
tab, click the Compare button, choose Show Source Documents, and choose 
an option on the submenu. You can hide the source documents, show the 
original document, show the revised edition, or show both editions.
Accepting and rejecting changes to a document
 
Word gives you the chance to accept or reject changes one at a time, but in 
my considerable experience with changes (I am a sometime editor), I find 
that the best way to handle changes is to go through the document, reject 
the changes you don’t care for, and when you have finished reviewing, 
accept all the remaining changes. That way, reviewing changes is only half 
as tedious.

Printing an Address on an Envelope
 
 Whatever your preference for accepting or rejecting changes, start by select-
ing a change. To do so, either click it or click the Previous or Next button on 
the Review tab to locate it in your document. With the change selected, do 
one of the following:
 
 
✦ Accept a change: Click the Accept button or open the drop-down list on 
the Accept button and choose Accept Change or Accept and Move to 
Next. You can also right-click and choose Accept.
 
 
✦ Reject a change: Click the Reject button or open the drop-down list on 
the Reject button and choose Reject Change or Reject and Move to Next. 
You can also right-click and choose Reject.
 
✦ Accept all changes: Open the drop-down list on the Accept button and 
choose Accept All Changes in Document.
 
✦ Reject all changes: Open the drop-down list on the Reject button and 
choose Reject All Changes in Document.
 
By way of the Accept and Reject buttons, you can also accept or reject all 
changes made by a single reviewer. First, isolate the reviewer’s changes 
by clicking the Show Markup button, choosing Reviewers, and selecting 
a reviewer’s name. Then open the drop-down list on the Accept or Reject 
button, and choose Accept All Changes Shown or Reject All Changes Shown.
Printing an Address on an Envelope
Printing addresses gives correspondence a formal, official look. It makes 
you look like a big shot. (Later in this chapter, “Churning Out Letters, 
Labels, and Envelopes for Mass Mailings” explains how to print more 
than one envelope at a time). Here’s how to print an address and a return 
address on an envelope:
 
1. To save a bit of time, open the document that holds the letter you 
want to send; then select the name and address of the person you 
want to send the letter to.
 
 By doing so, you save yourself from having to type the address. 
However, you don’t have to open a document to start with.
 
 2. On the Mailings tab, click the Envelopes button (you may have to click 
the Create button first, depending on the size of your screen).
 
 The Envelopes tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 5-5.

256

3. Enter a name and address in the Delivery Address box (the address is 
already there if you selected it in Step 1).
 
4. Enter your return address in the Return Address box, if you want.
 
5. Click the Omit check box if you don’t want your return address to 
appear on the envelope.
 
6. Click the Options button, and in the Envelope Options dialog box, 
tell Word what size your envelopes are and how your printer handles 
envelopes.
 
 Tell Word about your envelopes on the Envelope Options and Printing 
Options tabs, and click OK:
 
• Envelope Options tab: Choose an envelope size, a font for printing the 
delivery and return address, and a position for the addresses. The 
sample envelope in the Preview shows you what your position set-
tings do when the envelope is printed.
 
• Printing Options tab: Choose a technique for feeding envelopes to 
your printer. Consult the manual that came with your printer, select 
one of the Feed Method boxes, click the Face Up or Face Down 
option button, and open the Feed From drop-down list to tell Word 
which printer tray the envelope is in or how you intend to stick the 
envelope in your printer.
 
7. Click the Print button.

Printing a Single Address Label (Or a Page of the Same Label)
Printing a Single Address Label 
(Or a Page of the Same Label)
If you need to print a single label or a sheet of labels that are all the same, 
you can do it. Before you start printing, however, take note of the label’s 
Avery stock number, what size the label is, and its brand name. You are 
asked about label brands and sizes when you print labels. (Later in this 
chapter, “Churning Out Letters, Labels, and Envelopes for Mass Mailings” 
explains how to print multiple labels as part of a mass mailing.)
Follow these steps to print a single label or a sheet full of identical labels:
 
 1. On the Mailings tab, click the Labels button (you may have to click the 
Create button first, depending on the size of your screen).
 
 
 You see the Labels tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Printing

2. Enter the label — the name and address — in the Address box.
 
3. Either click the Options button or click the label icon in the Label box 
to open the Label Options dialog box.
 
4. In the Printer Information area, select either Continuous-Feed Printers 
or Page Printers to declare which kind of printer you have; on the 
Tray drop-down list, choose the option that describes how you will 
feed labels to your printer.

258
Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, and Labels for Mass Mailings
 
5. Open the Label Vendors drop-down list and choose the brand or type 
of labels that you have.
 
 If your brand is not on the list, click the Details button, and describe 
your labels in the extremely confusing Information dialog box. A better 
way, however, is to measure your labels and see whether you can find a 
label of the same size by experimenting with Product Number and Label 
Information combinations.
 
6. In the Product Number menu, select the product number listed on the 
box that your labels came in.
 
 Look in the Label Information box on the right to make sure that the 
Height, Width, and Page Size measurements match those of the labels 
you have.
 
7. Click OK to return to the Envelopes and Labels dialog box.
 
8. Choose a Print option.
 
 Tell Word to print a single label or a sheet full of labels:
 
• Full Page of the Same Label: Select this option button if you want to 
print a pageful of the same label. Likely, you’d choose this option 
to print a pageful of your own return addresses. Click the New 
Document button after you make this choice. Word creates a new 
document with a pageful of labels. Save and print this document on a 
sheet of labels.
 
• Single Label: Select this option button to print one label. Then enter 
the row and column where the label is located and click the Print 
button.
Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, 
and Labels for Mass Mailings
Thanks to the miracle of computing, you can churn out form letters, labels, 
and envelopes for a mass mailing in the privacy of your home or office, just 
as the big companies do. Churning out form letters, envelopes, and labels 
is easy, as long as you take the time to prepare the source file. The source 
file is the file that the names and addresses come from. A Word table, an 
Excel worksheet, a Microsoft Access database table or query, or an Outlook 
Contacts list or Address Book can serve as the source file. (Book III explains 
Outlook; Book V explains Excel; Book VI explains Access.)
To generate form letters, envelopes, or labels, you merge the form letter, 
envelope, or label document with a source file. Word calls this process merg-
ing. During the merge, names and addresses from the source file are plugged 
into the appropriate places in the form letter, envelope, or label document. 
When the merge is complete, you can either save the form letters, enve-
lopes, or labels in a new file or start printing right away.

Book II
Chapter 5
Getting Word’s Help 
with Office Chores
259
Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, and Labels for Mass Mailings
The following pages explain how to prepare the source file and merge 
addresses from the source file with a document to create form letters, 
labels, or envelopes. Then you discover how to print the form letters, labels, 
or envelopes after you have generated them.
 
Word offers a mail-merge wizard (wizard is Microsoft’s name for a step-
by-step procedure you can follow to accomplish a task). If you want to try 
your hand at using the wizard to complete a mail merge, go to the Mailings 
tab, click the Start Mail Merge button, and choose Step by Step Mail Merge 
Wizard on the drop-down list. Good luck to you!
Preparing the source file
If you intend to get addresses for your form letters, labels, or envelopes from 
an Outlook Contact List or Address Book on your computer, you’re ready 
to go. However, if you haven’t entered the addresses yet or you are keeping 
them in a Word table, Excel worksheet, Access database table, or Access 
query, make sure that the data is in good working order:
 
✦ Word table: Save the table in its own file and enter a descriptive head-
ing at the top of each column. In the merge, when you tell Word where 
to plug in address and other data, you will do so by choosing a heading 
name from the top of a column. In Figure 5-7, for example, the column 
headings are Last Name, First Name, Street, and so on. (Book I, Chapter 
5 explains how to construct a Word table.)
 
Figure 5-7: 
A Word 
source table 
for a mail 
merge.
 
 
✦ Excel worksheet: Arrange the worksheet in table format with a descrip-
tive heading atop each column and no blank cells in any columns. Word 
will plug in address and other data by choosing heading names.
 
✦ Access database table or query: Make sure that you know the field 
names in the database table or query where you keep the addresses. 
During the merge, you will be asked for field names. By the way, if you’re 
comfortable in Access, query a database table for the records you will 
need. As you find out shortly, Word offers a technique for choosing 
only the records you want for your form letters, labels, or envelopes. 
However, by querying first in Access, you can start off with the records 
you need and spare yourself from having to choose records in Word.

260
Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, and Labels for Mass Mailings
A Word table, Excel worksheet, or Access table or query can include more 
than address information. Don’t worry about deleting information that isn’t 
required for your form letters, labels, and envelopes. As you find out soon, 
you get to decide which information to include from the Word table, Excel 
worksheet, or Access table or query.
Merging the document with the source file
After you prepare the source file, the next step in generating form letters, 
labels, or envelopes for a mass mailing is to merge the document with the 
source file. Follow these general steps to do so:
 
1. Create or open a document.
 
• Form letters: Either create a new document and write your form 
letter, being careful to leave out the parts of the letter that differ 
from recipient to recipient, or open a letter you have already written 
and delete the addressee’s name, the address, and other parts of the 
letter that are particular to each recipient.
 
• Envelopes: Create a new document.
 
• Labels: Create a new document.
 
 2. On the Mailings tab, click the Start Mail Merge button.
 
 3. Choose Letters, Envelopes, or Labels on the drop-down list.
 
4. Prepare the groundwork for creating form letters, envelopes, or labels 
for a mass mailing.
 
 What you do next depends on what kind of mass mailing you want to 
attempt:
 
• Form letters: You’re ready to go. The text of your form letter already 
appears on-screen if you followed the directions for creating and 
writing it in Step 1.
 
• Envelopes: You see the Envelope Options dialog box, where, on the 
Envelope Options and Printing Options tabs, you tell Word what size 
envelope you will print on. See “Printing an Address on an Envelope,” 
earlier in this chapter, for instructions about filling out these tabs 
(see Step 6). A sample envelope appears on-screen.
 
• Labels: You see the Label Options dialog box, where you tell Word 
what size labels to print on. See “Printing a Single Address Label (or 
a Page of the Same Label)” earlier in this chapter, if you need advice 
for filling out this dialog box (refer to Steps 4 through 7).
 
 5. Click the Select Recipients button and choose an option on the drop-
down list to direct Word to your source file or the source of your 
address and data information.

Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, and Labels for Mass Mailings
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Preparing the source file” explains what a source 
file is. Your options are as follows:
 
• Addresses from a Word table, Excel worksheet, Access database table, 
or Access query: Choose Use Existing List. You see the Select Data 
Source dialog box. Locate the Word file, the Excel worksheet, or the 
Access database, select it, and click Open.
 
 If you select an Excel worksheet or Access database, you see the 
Select Table dialog box. Select the worksheet, table, or query you 
want and click the OK button.
 
• Addresses from Microsoft Outlook: Choose Select from Outlook 
Contacts (Outlook must be your default e-mail program to get 
addresses from Outlook). Then, in the Select Contact dialog box, 
choose Contacts and click OK.
 
 6. Click the Edit Recipient List button.
 
 
 The Mail Merge Recipients dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
7. In the Mail Merge Recipients dialog box, select the names of people to 
whom you will send mail; then click OK.
 
 To select recipients’ names, check or uncheck the boxes on the left side 
of the dialog box.

8. Enter the address block on your form letters, envelopes, or labels.
 
 The address block is the address, including the recipient’s name, com-
pany, title, street address, city, and ZIP Code. If you’re creating form let-
ters, click in the sample letter where the address block will go. If you’re 
printing on envelopes, click in the middle of the envelope where the 
delivery address will go. Then follow these steps to enter the address 
block:
 
 
a. Click the Address Block button. The Insert Address Block dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-9.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Creating 
the address 
block (left) 
and linking 
it with

b. Choose a format for entering the recipient’s name in the address 
block. As you do so, watch the Preview window; it shows the actual 
names and addresses that you selected in Step 7.
 
c. Click the Match Fields button. You see the Match Fields dialog box, 
shown in Figure 5-9.
 
d. Using the drop-down lists on the right side of the dialog box, match 
the fields in your source file with the address block fields on the left 
side of the dialog box. In Figure 5-9, for example, the Street field is 
the equivalent of the Address 1 field on the left side of the dialog box, 
so Street is chosen from the drop-down list to match Address 1.
 
e. Click OK in the Match Fields dialog box and the Insert Address Block 
dialog box. The <<AddressBlock>> field appears in the document 
where the address will go. Later, when you merge your document 
with the data source, real data will appear where the field is now. 
Think of a field as a kind of placeholder for data.
 
 9. Click the Preview Results button on the Mailings tab to see real data 
rather than fields.

 Now you can see clearly whether you entered the address block cor-
rectly. If you didn’t enter it correctly, click the Match Fields button (it’s 
in the Write & Insert Fields group) to open the Match Fields dialog box 
and make new choices.
 
10. Put the finishing touches on your form letters, labels, or envelopes:
 
 
• Form letters: Click where the salutation (“Dear John”) will go and then 
click the Greeting Line button. You see the Insert Greeting Line 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-10. Make choices in this dialog box 
to determine how the letters’ salutations will read.
 
Figure 5-10: 
Entering the 
greeting.
 
 
 
 The body of your form letter may well include other variable infor-
mation such as names and birthdays. To enter that stuff, click in 
your letter where variable information goes and then click the Insert 
Merge Field button. The Insert Merge Field dialog box appears and 
lists fields from the source file. Select a field, click the Insert button, 
and click the Close button. (You can also open the drop-down list on 
the Insert Merge Field button and choose a field from the source file.)
 
 If you are editing your form letter and you need to see precisely 
where the variable information you entered is located, click the 
Highlight Merge Fields button. The variable information is high-
lighted in your document.
 
• Envelopes: To position the address block correctly, you may have to 
press the Enter key and tab key to move it to the center of envelope. 
If you don’t like the fonts or font sizes on the envelope, select an 
address, go to the Home tab, and change fonts and font sizes there.
 
 To enter a return address, click in the upper-left corner of the enve-
lope and enter it there.
 
 
• Labels: Click the Update Labels button to enter all recipients’ labels 
in the sample document.

264
Churning Out Letters, Envelopes, and Labels for Mass Mailings
 
11. Click the Next Record and Previous Record buttons on the Mailings 
tab to skip from recipient to recipient and make sure that you have 
entered information correctly.
 
 These buttons are located in the Preview Results group. The items you 
see on-screen are the same form letters, envelopes, or labels you will see 
when you have finished printing. (Click the Preview Results button if you 
see field names rather than people’s names and addresses).
If an item is incorrect, open the source file and correct it there. When you 
save the source file, the correction is made in the sample document.
At last — you’re ready to print the form letters, envelopes, or labels. Better 
keep reading.
Printing form letters, envelopes, and labels
After you have gone to the trouble to prepare the data file and merge it with 
the document, you’re ready to print your form letters, envelopes, or labels. 
Start by loading paper, envelopes, or sheets of labels in your printer:
 
✦ Form letters: Form letters are easiest to print. Just put the paper in the 
printer.
 
✦ Envelopes: Not all printers are capable of printing envelopes one after 
the other. Sorry, but you probably have to consult the dreary manual that 
came with your printer to find out the correct way to load envelopes.
 
✦ Labels: Load the label sheets in your printer.
Now, to print the form letters, envelopes, or labels, save the material in a 
new document or send it straight to the printer:
 
 
✦ Saving in a new document: Click the Finish & Merge button and choose 
Edit Individual Documents (or press Alt+Shift+N). You see the Merge to 
New Document dialog box. Click OK. After Word creates the document, 
save it and print it. You can go into the document and make changes 
here and there before printing. In form letters, for example, you can 
write a sentence or two in different letters to personalize them.
 
✦ Printing right away: Click the Finish & Merge button and choose Print 
Documents (or press Alt+Shift+M) to print the form letters, envelopes, 
or labels without saving them in a document. Click OK in the Merge to 
Printer dialog box and then negotiate the Print dialog box.
 
Save the form letters, labels, or envelopes in a new document if you intend 
to print them at a future date or ink is running low on your printer and you 
may have to print in two or more batches. Saving in a new document permits 
you to generate the mass mailing without having to start all over again with 
the merge process and all its tedium.

his chapter is hereby dedicated to everyone who has had to delve into 
the unknown and write a report about it. Writing reports, manuals, and 
scholarly papers is not easy. You have to explore uncharted territory. You 
have to contemplate the ineffable. And you have to write bibliographies 
and footnotes and maybe an index, too. Word cannot take you directly to 
uncharted territory, but it can take some of the sting out of it.
This chapter explains how to handle footnotes and endnotes, generate a 
table of contents, index a document, include cross-references in documents, 
and stitch together a bibliography.
Alphabetizing a List
Which comes first in an alphabetical list, “San Jose, California” or “San José,

Outlines for Organizing Your Work
Outlines for Organizing Your Work
Outline view is a great way to see at a glance how your document is orga-
nized and whether you need to organize it differently. To take advantage of 
this feature, you must have assigned heading styles to the headings in your 
document (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains styles). In Outline view, you 
can see all the headings in your document. If a section is in the wrong place, 
you can move it by simply dragging an icon or by clicking one of the buttons 
on the Outlining tab. To change the rank of a heading, simply click a button 
to promote or demote it.
 
 To switch to Outline view, click the Outline button on the status bar or go to 
the View tab and click the Outline button. You see the Outlining tab, as 
shown in Figure 6-1. Rather than see text, you see the headings in your docu-
ment, as well as the first line underneath each heading. Now you get a sense 
of what is in your document and whether it is organized well. By choosing an 
option from the Show Level drop-down list, you can decide which headings 
to see on-screen.
To leave Outline view when you’re done reorganizing your document, click 
the Close Outline View button or a view button apart from Outline on the 
status bar.

✦ View heading formats: Click the Show Text Formatting check box. When 
this check box is selected, you can see how headings were formatted 
and get a better idea of their ranking in your document.
 
 
✦ View or hide the subheadings in one section: To see or hide the sub-
headings and text in one section of a document, select that section by 
clicking the plus sign beside its heading; then, click the Expand button 
(or press Alt+Shift+plus sign) to see the subheadings, or click the 
Collapse button (or press Alt+Shift+minus sign) to hide the subheadings. 
You can also double-click the plus sign beside a heading to view or hide 
its subheadings.
 
✦ View or hide paragraph text: Click the Show First Line Only check box 
(or press Alt+Shift+L). When this check box is selected, you see only the 
first line in each paragraph. First lines are followed by an ellipsis (. . .) so 
that you know that more text follows.
 
Notice the plus and minus icons next to the headings and the text. A plus 
icon means that the item has subheadings and text under it. For example, 
headings almost always have plus icons because text comes after them. 
A minus icon means that nothing is found below the item in question. For 
example, body text usually has a minus icon because body text is lowest on 
the Outline totem pole.
Rearranging document sections in Outline view
Outline view is mighty convenient for moving sections in a document and for 
promoting and demoting sections. Use these techniques to rearrange and 
reorganize your document:
 
 
✦ Move a section: To move a section up or down in the document, select it 
and click the Move Up or Move Down button (or press Alt+Shift+↑ or 
Alt+Shift+↓). You can also drag the plus sign to a new location. If you 
want to move the subheadings and subordinate text along with the sec-
tion, be sure to click the Collapse button to tuck all the subheadings and 
subtext into the heading before you move it.
 
 
✦ Promote and demote headings: Click the heading and then click the 
Promote button or Demote button (or press Alt+Shift+← or Alt+Shift+→). 
For example, you can promote a Level 3 heading to Level 2 by clicking the 

268
Generating a Table of Contents
Promote button. Click the Promote To Heading 1 button to promote any 
heading to a first-level heading; click the Demote To Body text button to 
turn a heading into prose.
 
✦ Choose a new level for a heading: Click the heading and choose a new 
heading level from the Outline Level drop-down list.
Generating a Table of Contents
A book-size document or long report isn’t worth very much without a table 
of contents (TOC). How else can readers find what they’re looking for? 
Generating a table of contents with Word is easy, as long as you give the 
headings in the document different styles — Heading 1, Heading 2, and so 
on. (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains styles.) The beautiful thing about 
Word TOCs is the way they can be updated nearly instantly. If you add a 
new heading or erase a heading, you can update the TOC with a snap of your 
fingers. Moreover, you can quickly go from a TOC entry to its corresponding 
heading in a document by Ctrl+clicking the entry.
 
Before you create your TOC, create a new section in which to put it and 
number the pages in the new section with Roman numerals (Chapter 2 of 
this mini-book explains sections and how to number pages). TOCs, including 
the TOC in this book, are usually numbered in this way. The first entry in the 
TOC should cite page number 1. If you don’t heed my advice and create a 
new section, the TOC will occupy the first few numbered pages of your docu-
ment, and the numbering scheme will be thrown off.
Creating a TOC
 
 To create a table of contents, place the cursor where you want the TOC to 
go, visit the References tab, and click the Table of Contents button. On the 
drop-down list, choose one of Word’s automatic TOC options or choose 
Insert Table of Contents to fashion a TOC on your own in the Table of 
Contents dialog box. (See “Customizing a TOC,” later in this chapter, for 
information about fashioning a TOC in the Table of Contents dialog box.)
 
Suppose that you want to copy a TOC to another document? To copy a 
TOC, drag the pointer down its left margin to select it, and then press 
Ctrl+Shift+F9. Next, use the Copy and Paste commands to copy the 
TOC to the other document. Because Word gives the text of TOCs the 
Hyperlink character style, you have to change the color of the text in the 
TOC (it’s blue) and remove the underlines. As for the original TOC, you 
“disconnected” it from the headings in your document when you pressed 
Ctrl+Shift+F9. Press the Undo button to undo the effects of pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+F9 and “disconnecting” your TOC from the headers to which it 
refers.

Generating a Table of Contents
Updating and removing a TOC
Follow these instructions to update and remove a TOC:
 
 
✦ Updating a TOC: If you add, remove, or edit a heading in your document, 
your TOC needs updating. To update it, go to the References tab and click 
the Update Table button, or click in the TOC and press F9. A dialog box 
asks how to update the TOC. Either update the page numbers only or 
update the entire table, including all TOC entries and page numbers.
 
✦ Removing a TOC: On the References tab, click the Table of Contents 
button and choose Remove Table of Contents on the drop-down list.
Customizing a TOC
 
 Want to tinker with your TOC? You can number the headings in different 
ways and tell Word to include or exclude certain headings.
To change around a TOC, click inside it, go to the References tab, click the 
Table of Contents button, and choose Insert Table of Contents on the drop-
down list. You see the Table of Contents dialog box shown in Figure 6-2. 
Choose options to declare which headings you want for your TOC and how 
you want to format it:
 
✦ Showing page numbers: Deselect the Show Page Numbers box if you 
want your TOC to be a simple list that doesn’t refer to headings by page.
 
✦ Aligning the page numbers: Select the Right Align Page Numbers check 
box if you want page numbers to line up along the right side of the TOC 
so that the ones and tens line up under each other.
 
✦ Choosing a tab leader: A leader is the punctuation mark that appears 
between the heading and the page number the heading is on. If you don’t 
want periods as the leader, choose another leader or choose (None).
 
✦ Choosing a format: Choose a format from the Formats drop-down list if 
you don’t care to use the one from the template. Just be sure to watch 
the Print Preview and Web Preview boxes to see the results of your 
choice.
 
✦ Choosing a TOC depth: The Show Levels box determines how many 
heading levels are included in the TOC. Unless your document is a legal 
contract or other formal paper, enter a 2 or 3 here. A TOC is supposed 
to help readers find information quickly. Including lots of headings that 
take a long time to read through defeats the purpose of having a TOC.

Figure 6-2: 
You can

yourself 
which 
headings 
go in a TOC 
and how it’s 
numbered.
 
Changing the structure of a TOC
Sometimes the conventional TOC that Word generates doesn’t do the trick. 
Just because a heading has been given the Heading 1 style doesn’t mean 
that it should receive first priority in the TOC. Suppose that you created 
another style called Chapter Title that should stand taller in the hierarchy 
than Heading 1. In that case, you need to rearrange the TOC so that Heading 
1 headings rank second, not first, in the TOC hierarchy.
Use the Table of Contents Options and Style dialog boxes to tinker with 
a TOC. These dialog boxes are shown in Figure 6-3. To open them, click, 
respectively, the Options button or Modify button in the Table of Contents 
dialog box (refer to Figure 6-2).
 
✦ Assigning TOC levels to paragraph styles: The Table of Contents 
Options dialog box lists each paragraph style in the document you’re 
working in. For headings you want to appear in the TOC, enter a number 
in the TOC Level text box to determine the headings’ rank. If headings 
assigned the Heading 1 style are to rank second in the TOC, for example, 
enter a 2 in Heading 1’s TOC Level text box. You can exclude headings 
from a TOC by deleting a number in a TOC Level box.
 
✦ Including table entry fields: To include text you marked for entry in the 
TOC, select the Table Entry Fields check box in the Table of Contents 
Options dialog box (later in this chapter, the sidebar “Marking oddball 
text for inclusion in the TOC” explains how TOC fields work).

✦ Changing the look of TOC entries: The Style dialog box you see when 
you click the Modify button gives you the chance to choose new fonts, 
character styles, and font sizes for TOC entries if you generated your 
TOC from a template. Click the Modify button. Then, in the Style dialog 
box, choose options to format the TOC style. For example, click the Bold 
button to boldface TOC entries. (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains 
modifying styles.)

Marking oddball text for inclusion in the TOC
Table of contents entries can refer to a par-
ticular place in a document, not just to head-
ings that have been assigned heading styles. 
For example, you can include figure captions. 
Use one of these techniques to mark an entry in 
your document for inclusion in the TOC:
✓  Click in the heading, figure caption, or 
whatnot. Next, click the Add Text button on 
the References tab and choose a TOC level 
on the drop-down list (the Do Not Show in 
Table of Contents option keeps text from 
being included in the TOC). If you choose 
Level 2, for example, the entry appears with 
other second-level headings.
 ✓ Click in a heading or text and press 
Alt+Shift+O. Then, in the Mark Table of 
Contents Entry dialog box, make sure that 
the words you want to appear in the TOC 
appear in the Entry text box (edit or enter 
the words if need be), and make sure 
that C (for Contents) appears in the Table 
Identifier box. In the Level box, enter a 
number to tell Word how to treat the entry 
when you generate the table of contents. 
For example, entering 1 tells Word to treat 
the entry like a first-level heading and give 
it top priority. A 3 places the entry with the 
third-level headings. Finally, click the Mark 
button.
When you generate the table of contents, be 
sure to include the oddball entries. To do that, 
click the Options button in the Table of Contents 
dialog box and, in the Table of Contents Options 
dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3), select the Table 
Entry Fields check box.

Indexing a Document
Indexing a Document
A good index is a thing of beauty. User manuals, reference works of any 
length, and reports that readers will refer to all require indexes. Except for 
the table of contents, the only way to find information in a long document is 
to look in the index. An index at the end of a company report reflects well on 
the person who wrote the report. It gives the appearance that the author put 
in a fair amount of time to complete the work, even if he or she didn’t really 
do that.
An index entry can be formatted in many ways. You can cross-reference 
index entries, list a page range in an index entry, and break out an index 
entry into subentries and sub-subentries. To help you with your index, 
Figure 6-4 explains indexing terminology.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Different 
ways of 
handling 
index 
entries.

Subentries
Cross-reference

Writing a good index entry is as hard as writing a good, descriptive heading. 
As you enter index entries in your document, ask yourself how you would 
look up information in the index, and enter your index entries accordingly.
Marking index items in the document
The first step in constructing an index is to mark index entries in your docu-
ment. Marking index items yourself is easier than it seems. After you open 
the Mark Index Entry dialog box, it stays open so that you can scroll through 
your document and make entries.

Indexing a Document
 
1. If you see a word or phrase in your document that you can use as a 
main, top-level entry, select it; otherwise, place the cursor in the para-
graph or heading whose topic you want to include in the index.
 
 You can save a little time by selecting a word, as I describe shortly.
 
 2. On the References tab, click the Mark Entry button (or press 
Alt+Shift+X).
 
 
 The Mark Index Entry dialog box appears. If you selected a word or 
phrase, it appears in the Main Entry box.
 
3. Choose how you want to handle this index entry (refer to Figure 6-4 to 
see the various ways to make index entries).
 
 When you enter the text, don’t put a comma or period after it. Word 
does that when it generates the index. The text that you enter appears in 
your index.
 
• Main Entry: If you’re entering a main, top-level entry, leave the text in 
the Main Entry box (if it’s already there), type new text to describe 
this entry, or edit the text that’s already there. Leave the Subentry 
box blank.
 
• Subentry: To create a subentry, enter text in the Subentry box. The 
subentry text will appear in the index below the main entry text, so 
make sure that some text is in the Main Entry box and that the sub-
entry text fits under the main entry.
 
• Sub-subentry: A sub-subentry is the third level in the hierarchy. To 
create a sub-subentry, type the subentry in the Subentry box, enter a 
colon (:), and type the sub-subentry without entering a space, like so: 
religious observances:shaman.
 
4. Decide how to handle the page reference in the entry.
 
 Again, your choices are many:
 
• Cross-reference: To go without a page reference and refer the reader 
to another index entry, click the Cross-Reference option button and 
type the other entry in the text box after the word See. What you 
type here appears in your index, so be sure that the topic you refer 
the reader to is really named in your index.
 
• Current Page: Click this option to enter a single page number after the 
entry.
 
• Page Range: Click this option if you’re indexing a subject that covers 
several pages in your document. A page range index entry looks 
something like this: “Sioux Indians, 149–157.” To make a page range 
entry, you must create a bookmark first. Leave the Mark Index Entry 
dialog box, select the text in the page range, and press Ctrl+Shift+F5 
or click the Bookmark button on the Insert tab. In the Bookmark 
dialog box, enter a name in the Bookmark Name box, and click the 
Add button. (Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains bookmarks.)

274
Indexing a Document
 
5. You can boldface or italicize a page number or page range by clicking 
a Page Number Format check box.
 
 In some indexes, the page or page range where the topic is explained in 
the most depth is italicized or boldfaced so that readers can get to the 
juiciest parts first.
 
6. If you selected a single word or phrase in Step 1, you can click the 
Mark All button to have Word go through the document and mark all 
words that are identical to the one in the Main Entry box; click Mark 
to put this single entry in the index.
 
 Click outside the Mark Index Entry dialog box and find the next topic 
or word that you want to mark for the index. Then click the Mark Entry 
button on the References tab and make another entry.
 
A bunch of ugly field codes appear in your document after you mark an 
index entry. You can render them invisible by clicking the Show/Hide¶ 
button on the Home tab (or pressing Ctrl+Shift+8).
Generating the index
After you mark all the index entries, it’s time to generate the index:
 
1. Place the cursor where you want the index to go, most likely at the 
end of the document.
 
 You might type the word Index at the top of the page and format the 
word in a decorative way.
 
 2. On the References tab, click the Insert Index button.
 
 You see the Index dialog box shown in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5:

an index.

3. Choose options in the dialog box and click OK.
 
 As you make your choices, watch the Print Preview box to see what 
happens.
Here are the options in the Index dialog box:
 
✦ Type: Choose Run-in if you want subentries and sub-subentries to run 
together; choose Indented to indent subentries and sub-subentries 
below main entries (refer to Figure 6-4).
 
✦ Columns: Stick with 2, unless you don’t have subentries or sub-suben-
tries and you can squeeze three columns on the page or you are working 
on a landscape document.
 
✦ Language: Choose a language for the table, if necessary and if you have 
installed a foreign language dictionary. If you have installed the diction-
ary, you can run the spell checker over your index and make sure that 
the entries are spelled correctly. (Book I, Chapter 4 explains foreign lan-
guage dictionaries.)
 
✦ Right Align Page Numbers: Normally, page numbers appear right after 
entries and are separated from entries by a comma, but with this option 
you can right-align the entries so that they line up under one another.
 
✦ Tab Leader: Some index formats place a leader between the entry and 
the page number. A leader is a series of dots or dashes. If you’re working 
with a format that has a leader, you can choose a leader from the drop-
down list.
 
✦ Formats: Word offers a number of attractive index layouts. You can 
choose one from the list.
 
✦ Modify: Click this button if you’re adventurous and want to create an 
index style of your own (Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains styles).
 
 To update an index after you create or delete entries, click it and then click 
the Update Index button or right-click the index and then choose Update 
Field on the shortcut menu.
Editing an index
 
 After you generate an index, read it carefully to make sure that all entries are 
useful to readers. Inevitably, something doesn’t come out right, but you can 
edit index entries as you would the text in a document. Index field markers 
are enclosed in curly brackets with the letters XE and the text of the index 
entry in quotation marks, like so: { XE: “Wovoka: Ghost Dance” }. To 
edit an index marker, click the Show/Hide¶ button on the Home tab (or press 
Ctrl+Shift+8) to see the field markers and find the one you need to edit. Then 
delete letters or type letters as you would do in normal text.

276
Putting a Cross-Reference in a Document
 
Here’s a quick way to find index field markers: After clicking the Show/Hide¶ 
button, with the index fields showing, press Ctrl+G to open the Go To tab of 
the Find and Replace dialog box. In the Go to What menu, choose Field; type 
XE in the Enter Field Name box, and click the Next button until you find the 
marker you want to edit. You can also use the Find command on the Home 
tab to look for index entries. Word finds index entries as well as text pro-
vided that you click the Show/Hide¶ button to display index fields in your 
document.
Putting Cross-References in a Document
Cross-references are very handy indeed. They tell readers where to go to find 
more information on a topic. The problem with cross-references, however, is 
that the thing being cross-referenced really has to be there. If you tell read-
ers to go to a heading called “The Cat’s Pajamas” on page 93, and neither the 
heading nor the page is really there, readers curse and tell you where to go, 
rather than the other way around.
Fortunately for you, Word lets you know when you make errant cross-
references. You can refer readers to headings, page numbers, footnotes, 
endnotes, and plain-old paragraphs. And as long you create captions for your 
cross-references with the Insert Caption button on the References tab, you 
can also make cross-references to equations, figures, graphs, listings, pro-
grams, and tables. If you delete the thing that a cross-reference refers to and 
render the cross-reference invalid, Word tells you about it the next time you 
update your cross-references. Best of all, if the page number, numbered item, 
or text that a cross-reference refers to changes, so does the cross-reference.
To create a cross-reference:
 
1. Write the first part of the cross-reference text.
 
 For example, you could write To learn more about these cowboys of 
the pampas, see page and then type a blank space. The blank space 
separates the word page from the page number in the cross-reference. If 
you are referring to a heading, write something like For more informa-
tion, see “. Don’t type a blank space this time because the cross-refer-
ence heading text will appear right after the double quotation mark.
 
 2. On the References tab, click the Cross-Reference button.
 
 The Cross-Reference dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
3. Choose what type of item you’re referring to in the Reference Type 
drop-down list.
 
 If you’re referring to a plain-old paragraph, choose Bookmark. Then click 
outside the dialog box, scroll to the paragraph you’re referring to, and 
place a bookmark there (Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains bookmarks.)

Choose what the reference refers to
Choose how to refer to the item
 
4. Make a choice in the Insert Reference To box to refer to text, a page 
number, or a numbered item.
 
 The options in this box are different, depending on what you chose in 
Step 3.
 
• Text: Choose this option (Heading Text, Entire Caption, and so on) 
to include text in the cross-reference. For example, choose Heading 
Text if your cross-reference is to a heading.
 
• Number: Choose this option to insert a page number or other kind of 
number, such as a table number, in the cross-reference.
 
• Include Above/Below: Select this box to include the word above or 
below to tell readers where, in relation to the cross-reference, the 
thing being referred to is located in your document.
 
5. If you want, leave the check mark in the Insert as Hyperlink check 
box to create a hyperlink as well as a cross-reference.
 
 With a hyperlink, someone reading the document on-screen can 
Ctrl+click the cross-reference and go directly to what it refers to.
 
6. In the For Which box, tell Word where the thing you’re referring to is 
located.
 
 To do so, select a heading, bookmark, footnote, endnote, equation, 
figure, graph, or whatnot. In long documents, you almost certainly have 
to click the scrollbar to find the one you want.
 
7. Click the Insert button and then click the Close button.
 
8. Back in your document, enter the rest of the cross-reference text, if 
necessary.

278
Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
When you finish creating your document, update all the cross-references. To 
do that, press Ctrl+A to select the entire document. Then press F9 or right-
click in the document and choose Update Field on the shortcut menu.
 
If the thing referred to in a cross-reference is no longer in your document, 
you see Error! Reference source not found where the cross-
reference should be. To find cross-reference errors in long documents, look 
for the word Error! with the Find command (press Ctrl+F). Investigate what 
went wrong, and repair or delete errant cross-references.
Putting Footnotes and Endnotes in Documents
A footnote is a bit of explanation, a comment, or a reference that appears at 
the bottom of the page and is referred to by a number or symbol in the text. 
An endnote is the same thing, except that it appears at the end of the sec-
tion, chapter, or document. If you’ve written a scholarly paper of any kind, 
you know what a drag footnotes and endnotes are.
You will be glad to know that Word takes some of the drudgery out of foot-
notes and endnotes. For example, if you delete or add a note, all notes after 
the one you added or deleted are renumbered. And you don’t have to worry 
about long footnotes because Word adjusts the page layout to make room 
for them. You can change the numbering scheme of footnotes and endnotes 
at will. When you are reviewing a document, all you have to do is move the 
pointer over a footnote or endnote citation. The note icon appears, as does a 
pop-up box with the text of the note. 
Entering a footnote or endnote
To enter a footnote or endnote in a document:
 
1. Place the cursor in the text where you want the note’s number or 
symbol to appear.
 
2. On the References tab, click the Insert Footnote button (or press 
Ctrl+Alt+F) or the Insert Endnote button (or press Ctrl+Alt+D). 
 
 If you are in Draft view, the Notes pane opens at the bottom of the 
screen with the cursor beside the number of the note you’re about to 
enter. In Print Layout view, Word scrolls to the bottom of the page or 
the end of the document or section so that you can enter the note, as 
shown in Figure 6-7.
 
3. Enter your footnote or endnote.
 
4. Click the Close button in the Notes pane if you’re in Draft view; in 
Print Layout view, scroll upward to return to the main text.

 Click the Show Notes button at any time to see your notes in the Notes pane, 
at the bottom of the page, or at the end of the section or document.
 
To quickly return from writing a note to the place in your document where 
the footnote or endnote number citation is located, double-click the number 
citation at the bottom of the page (in Print Layout view) or the Notes pane 
(in Draft view). For example, if you just finished entering footnote 3, double-
click the number 3.
Choosing the numbering scheme 
and position of notes
Choosing the numbering scheme and positioning of endnotes and footnotes 
is quite easy. On the References tab, click the Footnotes group button. The 
Footnote and Endnote dialog box appears (refer to Figure 6-7). Tell Word 
where to place your notes:
 
✦ Footnotes: Choose Bottom of Page to put footnotes at the bottom of the 
page no matter where the text ends; choose Below Text to put footnotes 
directly below the last line of text on the page.
 
✦ Endnotes: Choose End of Section if your document is divided into sec-
tions (such as chapters) and you want endnotes to appear at the back of 
sections; choose End of Document to put all endnotes at the very back 
of the document.
In the Format area, tell Word how to number the notes:
 
✦ Number Format: Choose A B C, i ii iii, or another numbering scheme, if 
you want. You can also enter symbols by choosing the last option on 
this drop-down list.
 
✦ Custom Mark: You can mark the note with a symbol by clicking the 
Symbol button and choosing a symbol in the Symbol dialog box. If you 
go this route, you have to enter a symbol each time you insert a note. 

280
Compiling a Bibliography
Not only that, you may have to enter two or three symbols for the 
second and third notes on each page or document because Word can’t 
renumber symbols.
 
✦ Start At: To start numbering the notes at a place other than 1, A, or i, 
enter 2, B, ii, or whatever in this box.
 
✦ Numbering: To number the notes continuously from the start of your 
document to the end, choose Continuous. Choose Restart Each Section 
to begin anew at each section of your document. For footnotes, you can 
begin anew on each page by choosing Restart Each Page.
By the way, the Convert button in the Footnote and Endnote dialog box is for 
fickle scholars who suddenly decide that their endnotes should be footnotes 
or vice versa. Click it and choose an option in the Convert Notes dialog box 
to turn footnotes into endnotes, turn endnotes into footnotes, or — in docu-
ments with both endnotes and footnotes — make the endnotes footnotes 
and the footnotes endnotes.
Deleting, moving, and editing notes
If a devious editor tells you that a footnote or endnote is in the wrong place, 
that you don’t need a note, or that you need to change the text in a note, all 
is not lost:
 
✦ Editing: To edit a note, double-click its number or symbol in the text. 
You see the note on-screen. Edit the note at this point.
 
✦ Moving: To move a note, select its number or symbol in the text and 
drag it to a new location, or cut and paste it to a new location.
 
✦ Deleting: To delete a note, select its number or symbol and press the 
Delete key.
Footnotes and endnotes are renumbered when you move or delete one of 
them.
Compiling a Bibliography
A bibliography is a list, usually in alphabetical order by author name, of all 
the books, journal articles, Web sites, interviews, and other sources used 
in the writing of an article, report, or book. Writing a good bibliography is a 
chore. Besides keeping careful track of sources, you have to list them cor-
rectly. Does the author’s name or work’s name come first in the citation? 
How do you list a Web site or magazine article without an author’s name?
Word’s Bibliography feature is very nice in this regard: It solves the problem 
of how to enter citations for a bibliography. All you have to do is enter the 
bare facts about the citation — the author’s name, title, publication date,

publisher, and so on — and Word presents this information correctly in the 
bibliography. You can choose among several popular bibliographical styles 
(APA, Chicago, and others) from the Style drop-down list, as shown in Figure 
6-8. After you make your choice, Word reformats all bibliography citations. 
You don’t have to worry about whether titles should be underlined or itali-
cized, or how authors’ names should be listed in the bibliography.

Inserting a citation for your bibliography
Abbreviated citations appear in the text of your document in between 
parentheses where you enter citations; the complete citation appears in the 
bibliography. After you enter the information about a citation, entering it 
a second time is easy because Word keeps a master list of all citations you 
have used in your work, both in the document you are working on and in 
your other documents. To enter a citation, click in your document at the 
place that refers to the source, go to the References tab, and use one of 
these techniques to enter the citation:
 
 
✦ Entering a citation you’ve already entered in your document: Click the 
Insert Citation button and choose the citation on the drop-down list. The 
top of the drop-down list presents citations you’ve already entered.
 
✦ Creating a new citation: Click the Insert Citation button and choose Add 
New Source. You see the Create Source dialog box shown in Figure 6-8. 
Choose an option on the Type of Source drop-down list and enter par-

ticulars about the source. You can click the Show All Bibliography Fields 
check box to enlarge the dialog box and enter all kinds of information 
about the source. Whether clicking the check box is necessary depends 
on how detailed you want your bibliography to be.
 
✦ Inserting a citation placeholder: Click the Insert Citation button and 
choose Add New Placeholder if you’re in a hurry and you don’t cur-
rently have all the information you need to describe the source. The 
Placeholder Name dialog box appears. Enter a placeholder name for 
the source and click OK. Later, when you have the information for the 
source, either click the citation in the text and choose Edit Source on its 
drop-down list or click the Manage Sources button, and in the Source 
Manager dialog box, select the placeholder name (it has a question mark 
next to it) and click the Edit button. You see the Edit Source dialog box. 
Enter the information and click OK.
 
 
✦ Inserting a citation you’ve entered in another document: Click the 
Manage Sources button. You see the Source Manager dialog box. In the 
Master List, select the source you need and click the Copy button. Then 
click Close and enter the citation by clicking the Insert Citation button 
and choosing the name of the citation you copied.
Your citation appears in text in parentheses. Move the pointer over it and 
you see an inline drop-down list that you can open to edit the citation as it 
appears in-text as well as edit it in the bibliography, as shown in Figure 6-9.

Editing a citation
Use one of these techniques to edit a citation:
 
✦ Open the citation’s inline drop-down list (refer to Figure 6-9) and choose 
Edit Source. You see the Edit Source dialog box, where you can edit the 
citation.
 
 
✦ Click the Manage Sources button on the References tab. The Source 
Manager dialog box appears. Select the citation, click the Edit button, 
and change around the citation in the Edit Source dialog box.

Changing how citations appear in text
Citations appear in text enclosed in parentheses. Use one of these tech-
niques to change how a citation appears in the text of your document:
 
✦ Changing what’s in parentheses: Open the citation’s drop-down list and 
choose Edit Citation (refer to Figure 6-9). You see the Edit Citation dialog 
box. To suppress the author’s name, year, or title from appearing inside 
parentheses, click the Author, Year, or Title check box (whether the 
citation in parentheses lists the author, year, or title depends on which 
citation style you choose). To make page numbers appear with the cita-
tion, enter page numbers in the Pages box.
 
✦ Removing the in-text citation: Swipe over the citation to select it and 
press Delete. Removing an in-text citation this way does not prevent the 
citation from appearing in the bibliography.
Generating the bibliography
Go to the References tab and follow these steps to generate your bibliography:
 
1. Click in your document where you want the bibliography to appear.
 
 Probably that place is toward the end of the document.
 
2. On the References tab, open the Style drop-down list and choose a 
style.
 
 If you’re generating your bibliography for a paper you will submit to a 
journal or institution, ask the editors which style they prefer for bibliog-
raphies and choose that style from the list.
 
 3. Click the Manage Sources button.
 
 You see the Source Manager dialog box. Citations in the Current List box 
will appear in your bibliography.
 
4. If necessary, address citations in the Current List box.
 
 If you entered any citation placeholders, their names appear in the list 
next to question marks. Select these placeholders, click the Edit button, 
and enter information in the Edit Source dialog box. 
 
 To keep a citation from appearing in the bibliography, select it and click 
the Delete button.
 
5. Click the Close button in the Source Manager dialog box.
 6. Click the Bibliography button and choose a built-in bibliography or 
the Insert Bibliography command on the drop-down list.
There it is — your bibliography.

his chapter pulls back the curtain and gives you a first glimpse of 
Outlook, the e-mailer and personal organizer in the Office 2010 suit of 
programs. Read on to find out once and for all what Outlook does, how to 
get from folder to folder, and the different ways to view the stuff in folders. 
You can find advice about keeping folders well organized, deleting stuff, 
backing up an Outlook file, and cleaning out items in folders that you no 
longer need.
What Is Outlook, Anyway?
Outlook isn’t in character with the rest of the Office programs. It’s a little dif-
ferent in that what you see on-screen changes when you click a Navigation 
pane button on the left side of the window. Click a Navigation pane button — 
Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, Folder List, or Shortcuts — and you go 
to a different Outlook window altogether.
Outlook can be confusing because the program serves many different pur-
poses. To wit, Outlook is all this:
 
 ✦ An e-mail program: You can use it to send and receive e-mail messages 
and files, as well as organize e-mail messages in different folders so that 
you can keep track of them. (See Chapter 3 of this mini-book.)

288
What is Outlook, Anyway?
 
 
✦ An appointment scheduler: Outlook is a calendar for scheduling 
appointments and meetings. You can tell at a glance when and where 
you’re expected, as well as be alerted to upcoming appointments and 
meetings. (See Chapter 4 of this mini-book.)
 
 
✦ An address book: The program can store the addresses, phone num-
bers, and e-mail addresses of friends, foes, clients, and family members. 
Looking up this information in the Contacts List is easy. (See Chapter 2 
of this mini-book.)
 
 
✦ A task reminder: Outlook is a means of planning projects. You can tell 
when deadlines fall and plan your workload accordingly. (See Chapter 5 
of this mini-book.)
 
 
✦ A notes receptacle: This part of the program is a place to jot down notes 
and reminders. (See Chapter 5 of this mini-book.)
Outlook is a lot of different things all rolled into one. For that reason, the 
program can be daunting at first. But hang in there. Soon you’ll be running 
roughshod over Outlook and making it suffer on your behalf.
Do you need Outlook?
Before you penetrate the mysteries of Outlook, 
ask yourself whether you need the program. 
If you don’t receive volumes of e-mail, your 
calendar isn’t crowded, and the office where 
you work doesn’t require you to use Outlook, 
consider using an e-mail program that isn’t as 
cumbersome as Outlook, or better yet, consider 
using a Web-based e-mail program.
Outlook is good at organizing e-mail so that 
you can find and reply to messages quickly. It 
is good at handling volumes of e-mail. Outlook 
can help you manage schedules and coordi-
nate meetings with co-workers. It can help you 
keep track of where you’re supposed to be and 
when you’re supposed to be there.
On the minus side, however, Outlook is an 
example of what people in the computer indus-
try call “bloatware.” The program has many 
more features than most people need, and all 
these features clutter Outlook and make it hard 
to use. What’s more, e-mail messages are kept 
on your computer. Unless you carry around a 
laptop, you have to be at your home or office 
computer to collect your e-mail. With a Web-
based e-mail program, messages are stored 
on a server on the Internet, and all e-mail 
activity — composing, sending, and receiving 
messages — is accomplished through a Web 
browser. You can be in Timbuktu and still col-
lect your e-mail if you can find a computer with 
an Internet connection. You don’t have to be at 
home or at the office to read your e-mail.
If Web-based e-mailing appeals to you, ask 
your Internet service provider whether it offers 
a Web-based e-mail service. Or check out 
these Web-based e-mail programs, both of 
which are free and easy to use: Google Mail 
(www.gmail.com) and Yahoo! Mail (mail.
yahoo.com). These programs offer a calen-
dar and other amenities as well as e-mailing. If 
you want to keep it simple and you can manage 
to do that, steer clear of Outlook.

Navigating the Outlook Folders
Navigating the Outlook Folders
The first thing you should know about Outlook is this: All items are kept in 
folders, as shown in Figure 1-1. E-mail messages when they arrive are kept in 
the Inbox folder. Calendar items are kept in the Calendar folder. Notes are 
kept in the Notes folder. When you want to undertake a new task, you go to a 
different folder.
 
Figure 1-1:

with the 
Inbox folder 
selected.
 
Navigation pane
Selected folder
To-Do bar
Reading pane
Here are the ways to get from folder to folder in Outlook and undertake a 
new task:
 
✦ Navigation pane: Click a button in the Navigation pane — Mail, 
Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, or Notes — to go to a folder. The Navigation 
pane appears on the left side of the window (refer to Figure 1-1).
 
 
✦ Folder List: Click the Folder List button (or press Ctrl+6) and select a 
folder in the Navigation pane. For example, to read incoming e-mail mes-
sages, select the Inbox folder (refer to Figure 1-1). The Folder List button 
is located at the bottom of the Navigation pane.

290
Wrestling with the Navigation Pane and To-Do Bar
 
You can open a folder in a new window. To do so, right-click a Navigation pane 
button or folder name and choose Open in New Window. To close a window 
you opened this way, click its Close button (the X in the upper-right corner).
Wrestling with the Navigation Pane and To-Do Bar
Outlook is designed for you to move from folder to folder with no trouble. 
All you have to do to open a new folder is click a button or folder icon in the 
Navigation pane. However, sometimes the Navigation pane gets in the way. 
You need the extra space for reading e-mail messages or rummaging in the 
Contacts folder. Here are instructions for wrestling with the Navigation pane, 
To-Do Bar, and Reading pane:
 
 
✦ Hiding and displaying the Navigation pane: As I explain earlier, the 
Navigation pane appears on the left side of the window and offers buttons 
and folder names that you can click to go to different folders (refer to Figure 
1-1). Click the Expand or Maximize buttons in the Navigation pane (or press 
Alt+F1) to display or hide it. You can also go to the View tab, click the 
Navigation Pane button, and choose an option on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Hiding and displaying the To-Do Bar: The To-Do Bar appears on the 
right side of the screen and shows your calendar, upcoming appoint-
ments, and tasks arranged by due date (refer to Figure 1-1). Click a 
calendar day to open the Calendar on that day. Double-click an appoint-
ment to open an Appointment window, or a task to open a Task window. 
To display or hide the To-Do Bar, click its Expand or Minimize button 
(or press Alt+F2). You can also go the View tab, click the To-Do Bar 
button, and choose an option on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Hiding and displaying Reading pane: The Reading pane appears on the 
right side or bottom of the window and gives you a more detailed look at 
an item you selected. It comes in handy when you’re reading e-mail 
because you can read a message and still view your message list (refer 
to Figure 1-1). To display or hide the Reading pane, go to the View tab, 
click the Reading Pane button, and choose Right, Bottom, or Off from 
the drop-down list. When the Reading pane is displayed, you can also 
hide it by dragging its border to the bottom or right side of the window.
Getting a Better View of Items in a Folder
Because you spend so much time gazing at folders, it pays to know the differ-
ent ways to view items in folders. Each folder offers different ways of viewing 
its contents. Go to the Home tab and View tab to discover different tech-
niques for viewing items. Figure 1-2 shows the Contacts folder in Business 
Cards view. You can see contacts in business card form by going to the 
Home tab and choosing Business Cards in the Current View gallery. I explain 
different ways of looking at items in folders throughout this mini-book.

Categorizing Items
 
Figure 1-2:

folder in

Cards view.
 
Categorizing Items
One of your biggest tasks in Outlook, if you choose to accept it, is to cat-
egorize items in folders so that you can find and deal with them. Finding 
items can be a chore in a folder with a lot of items, but by categorizing 
items, you can find the ones you’re looking for. Categories are color-coded 
to make identifying them easier. After you assign a category to an item, 
you can arrange items in folders by category, and in so doing, find items. 
Categorizing is a great way to stay on top of all the chores you have to do.
Creating a category
Follow these steps to create a category for organizing folder items:
 
1. Select an item in a folder to which you want to assign your new 
category.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Categorize button and choose All 
Categories on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Color Categories dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. At 
this point, you can create a category from scratch or revamp one of 
Outlook’s color-named categories:
 
• Creating your own category: Click the New button to open the Add 
New Category dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. Then enter a 
name for your category and choose a color from the drop-down list. 
While you’re at it, you can open the Shortcut Key drop-down list 

292
Categorizing Items
and choose a shortcut key combination for assigning your new cat-
egory to items (refer to Figure 1-3). Click the OK button in the Color 
Categories dialog box.
 
• Renaming a category: In the Color Categories dialog box (refer to 
Figure 1-3), select a color category, and click the Rename button. 
Then enter a new name where the old one is now. You can choose 
a different color for your category by choosing a color in the Color 
drop-down list. To assign it a shortcut key, open the Shortcut Key 
drop-down list and choose a shortcut key combination.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Click the 
New button 
or Rename 
button to 
create 
a new 
category.
 
To delete a category, return to the Color Categories dialog box, select the 
category’s name, and click the Delete button. Although the category is 
deceased, items to which you assigned the category keep their category 
assignments.
Assigning items to categories
Follow these steps to assign a category to a folder item:
 
1. Select the item.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Categorize button and choose a category 
on the drop-down list.
 
 You can also right-click, choose Categorize, and select a category on the 
shortcut menu, or press a Ctrl+key combination if you assigned one to 
the category. An item can be assigned more than one category.
To remove a category assignment, select the item, click the Categorize 
button, and choose Clear All Categories.
 
Another way to quickly categorize an e-mail message is to click the Category 
column of the message in a mail folder window. To tell Outlook which cat-
egory to assign when you click the Category column, click the Categorize 
button and choose Set Quick Click. You see the Set Quick Click dialog box.

Searching for Stray Folder Items
Choose the category on the drop-down list that you want to assign by 
”quick-clicking” in the Category column.
Arranging items by category in folders
To arrange items by category in a folder, select the folder in the Navigation 
pane and use one of these techniques:
 
✦ On the View tab, choose Categories in the Arrange By gallery.
 
✦ In a list, click the Categories column heading to sort items by category.
You can also click the Categorized button on the (Search Tools) Search tab 
to organize the results of a search by category.
Searching for Stray Folder Items
If you can’t locate an item in a folder by scrolling, changing views, or any 
other means, run a search. To start your search, go to the folder you want to 
search and click in the Search box (or press Ctrl+E). You can find the Search 
box below the Ribbon. As soon as you click in the Search box, Outlook opens 
the (Search Tools) Search tab so that you can describe what you’re seeking, 
as shown in Figure 1-4.

Searching for Stray Folder Items
As the following pages explain, you can conduct an instant search, narrow 
your search by choosing Refine options, or conduct an advanced search 
starting from the (Search Tools) Search tab. Search results appear in the 
window below the Search box. To close the search and go back to seeing the 
contents of your folder, click the Close Search button (the X on the right side 
of the Search box).
 
 Here’s a fast way to run a search: Click the Recent Searches button on the 
(Search Tools) Search tab and choose a search on the drop-down list to 
rerun one of the last six searches you conducted.
Conducting an instant search
What Microsoft calls an “instant search” is a keyword search of the folder 
you’re viewing. If a keyword you enter in the Search box is found in an e-mail 
message, calendar appointment, contact, or other item, the item appears 
in the search results and the keyword is highlighted (refer to Figure 1-4). 
Search results begin appearing as soon as you start to type. You don’t have 
to press the Enter key to begin the search.
 
To change how instant searches are conducted, click the Search Tools 
button and choose Search Options on the drop-down list. You go to the 
Search category in the Outlook Options dialog box. From there, you can 
choose which folders are searched and how search results are displayed 
when you conduct an instant search.
Refining a search
Refine a search when an instant search brings up too many or too few 
search results. Starting on the (Search Tools) Search tab, refine your search 
by changing its scope and choosing Refine options.
Changing the scope of a search
How wide the scope of a search is determines how many results are found in 
the search. To narrow or widen a search, click a button in the Scope group 
on the (Search Tools) Search tab:
 
✦ All Items: Searches the folder you selected on the Navigation pane as 
well as its related folders. For example, clicking the All Mail Items button 
searches all folders that contain e-mail, including the Drafts and Sent 
Items folders. This button changes names, depending on which folder 
you selected. You can also press Ctrl+Alt+A.
 
✦ Current Folder: Searches the folder you selected on the Navigation 
pane. You can also press Ctrl+Alt+K.
 
✦ All Subfolders: Searches the folder you selected on the Navigation pane 
as well as its subfolders. You can also press Ctrl+Alt+Z.
 
✦ All Outlook Items: Searches all Outlook folders.

Deleting E-mail Messages, Contacts, Tasks, and Other Items
Choosing Refine options
To narrow a search, click buttons in the Refine group on the (Search Tools) 
Search tab. After you click a button, Outlook provides a place in the Search 
box for you to enter a keyword. Which buttons appear in the Refine group 
depends on which folder you search.
In a folder that contains e-mail, for example, you can click the From button 
and enter a sender name in the Search box to search for e-mails you 
received from a particular person. You can click the Subject button and 
enter a keyword to search the subject descriptions in e-mail you received.
Conducting an advanced search
 
 If, woe is me, you can’t find what you’re looking for with an instant search or 
a refined search, you can try your luck with an advanced search. On the 
(Search Tools) Search tab, click the Search Tools button and choose 
Advanced Find on the drop-down list. You see the Advanced Find dialog box. 
In the Look For drop-down list, choose what you want to search for. Click 
the Browse button to open the Select Folder(s) dialog box, where you can 
select more than one folder to search in. Then choose options in the three 
tabs to formulate your search. Which options are available depends on 
which folder you’re searching.
Deleting E-Mail Messages, Contacts, 
Tasks, and Other Items
Outlook folders are notorious for filling quickly. E-mail messages, contacts, 
and tasks soon clog the folders if you spend any time in Outlook. From time 
to time, go through the e-mail folders, Contacts window, Task window, and 
Calendar to delete items you no longer need. To delete items, select them 
and do one of the following:
 
 
✦ Click the Delete button.
 
✦ Press the Delete key.
 
✦ Right-click and choose Delete.
 
Deleted items — e-mail messages, calendar appointments, contacts, and 
tasks — land in the Deleted Items folder in case you want to recover them. 
To delete items once and for all, open the Deleted Items folder and start 
deleting like a madman.
To empty the Delete Items folder altogether, right-click the folder and 
choose Empty Folder. You can also visit the File tab, choose Info, click the

Finding and Backing Up Your Outlook File
Cleanup Tools button, and choose Empty Deleted Items Folder on the drop-
down list.
Be sure to check out “Running the Mailbox Cleanup command” at the end of 
this chapter. It explains a quick way to delete unwanted Inbox messages.
Finding and Backing Up Your Outlook File
All the data you keep in Outlook — e-mail messages, names and addresses, 
calendar appointments and meetings — is kept in a .pst file on your com-
puter. Locating this file on your computer sometimes requires the services 
of Sherlock Holmes. The file isn’t kept in a standard location. It can be any 
number of places, depending on the operating system on your computer and 
whether you upgraded from an earlier version of Office.
The all-important .pst file is hiding deep in your computer, but you need to 
find it. You need to know where this file is located so that you can back it up 
to a CD, flash drive, or other backup medium. It holds clients’ names and the 
names of relatives and loved ones. It holds the e-mail messages you think are 
worth keeping. It would be a shame to lose this stuff if your computer failed.
Here’s a quick way to find the .pst file on your computer and back it up:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Info.
 
 
 The Account Information window opens.
 
2. Click the Account Settings button and choose Account Settings on the 
drop-down list.
 
 You see the Account Settings dialog box.
 
3. Go to the Data Files tab.
 
 This tab is shown in Figure 1-5. It lists the location of your .pst file 
(or files).
 
4. Select your .pst file and click the Open File Location button.
 
 Windows Explorer opens, and you see the folder where your .pst file is 
kept.
 
5. Close Outlook.
 
 Sorry, but you can’t back up a .pst file if Outlook is running.
 
6. To back up the file, right-click it in Windows Explorer, choose Send 
To on the shortcut menu, and choose the option on the submenu that 
represents where you back up files.
 
 If an accident befalls your computer, copy the backup .pst file that you 
made into the folder where the .pst file is stored on your computer.

Quick-steppin’
When you visit a folder that holds e-mail and 
go to the Home tab, you see the Quick Steps 
gallery. Choose a so-called quick step in this 
gallery to accomplish a task quickly. For exam-
ple, choose Reply & Delete to open a message 
window, reply to a message, and delete the 
message automatically when you send your 
reply. You can save a bit of time by making use 
of the quick steps in the Quick Steps gallery.
If you’re ambitious, you can add your own 
quick step to the gallery. Click Create New in 
the gallery, and in the Edit Quick Step dialog 
box, name and choose an action to add to the 
gallery. You can choose from filing actions, 
change status actions, and other types of 
actions. Click the Add Action button to place 
your new action in the Quick Steps gallery.
To feed and care for quick steps, open the 
Quick Steps gallery and choose Manage Quick 
Steps. In the Manage Quick Steps dialog box, 
you can edit quick steps, delete them, and rear-
range them in the Quick Step gallery.

Importing E-Mail and Addresses from Another Program
Importing E-Mail and Addresses 
from Another Program
Suppose that you’ve been using Outlook Express, Lotus Organizer, or 
another e-mail program to handle your e-mail and contact addresses, but 
now you’ve become a convert to Outlook. What do you do with the e-mail 
messages and names and addresses in the other program? You can’t let 
them just sit there or you can import them into Office and pick up where you 
left off.
 
 To import e-mail and contact addresses from another program, go to the 
File tab, choose Open, and click the Import button. You see the Import and 
Export Wizard. What you do next depends on where you now do your 
e-mailing and address tracking:
 
✦ Outlook Express: Select Import Internet Mail and Addresses and click 
Next. In the Outlook Import Tool dialog box, select Outlook Express, 
select check boxes to decide what to import (Mail, Addresses, and/or 
Rules), and click the Finish button.
 
✦ Eudora: Select Import Internet Mail and Addresses and click Next. In the 
Outlook Import Tool dialog box, select Eudora, choose options to decide 
what to do about duplicate entries, and click the Finish button. In the 
Browser for Folder dialog box, select the file where the Eudora data is 
kept and click OK.
 
✦ Lotus Organizer: Select Import from Another Program or File, click Next, 
select a Lotus Organizer, and click Next again. Click Next while you go 
along. You’re asked how to handle duplicate items, to locate the Lotus 
Organizer data file, and to select an Outlook folder to put the data in.
 
Before you import e-mail and addresses from another program, weed out the 
e-mail messages and addresses you no longer need. Why ferry this stuff into 
Outlook when you no longer need it?
Cleaning Out Your Folders
Getting rid of unneeded items in folders is essential for good mental health. 
All that clutter can be distressing. Earlier in this chapter, “Deleting E-Mail 
Messages, Contacts, Tasks, and Other Items” explains how to muck out fold-
ers by emptying them. These pages explain two more techniques for remov-
ing detritus from folders — archiving and the Mailbox Cleanup command.
Archiving the old stuff
In some cases, Outlook puts e-mail messages, tasks, and appointments older 
than six months in the Archive folder, a special folder for items that Outlook 

Book III
Chapter 1
Getting Acquainted 
with Outlook

Cleaning Out Your Folders
thinks are stale and not worth keeping anymore. Outlook calls sending these 
items to the Archive folder ”autoarchiving.” Items that have been archived 
aren’t lost forever. You can visit them by opening the Archive Folders folder 
and its subfolders on the Folders List. These folders and subfolders are cre-
ated automatically the first time you archive items.
Archiving is a way of stripping your mail folders, tasks lists, and calendar of 
items that don’t matter anymore. How and when items are archived is up 
to you. To archive items, you establish a default set of archiving rules that 
apply to all folders, and if a folder needs individual attention and shouldn’t 
be subject to the default archiving rules, you establish special rules for that 
folder. Each folder can have its own set of archiving rules or be subject to 
the default rules.
To tell Outlook how to archive old stuff:
 
 
✦ Establishing default archiving rules: On the File tab, choose Options to 
open the Outlook Options dialog box. Then, on the Advanced tab, click 
the AutoArchive Settings button. You see the AutoArchive dialog box 
shown in Figure 1-6. See “Default archiving rules.”
 
 
✦ Establishing rules for a specific folder: Select the folder, go to the 
Folder tab, and click the AutoArchive Settings button. You see the 
AutoArchive tab of the Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-6. 
See “Archiving rules for a folder.”

Default archiving rules
Negotiate these options to establish default archiving rules (refer to 
Figure 1-6):
 
✦ Run AutoArchive Every: Enter a number to tell Outlook how often to 
archive items.

300
Cleaning Out Your Folders
 
✦ Prompt Before Archive Runs: If this check box is selected, you see a 
message box before archiving begins, and you can decline to archive if 
you want by selecting No in the message box.
 
✦ Delete Expired Items (E-Mail Folders Only): Select this check box to 
delete all e-mail messages when the time period has expired.
 
✦ Archive or Delete Old Items: Deselect this option if you don’t want to 
archive items.
 
✦ Show Archive Folder in Folder List: Select this option if you want to 
keep the archived version of the folder in the Folder List. Archived items 
are kept in this folder so that you can review them.
 
✦ Clean Out Items Older Than: Choose a cutoff time period after which to 
archive items.
 
✦ Move Old Items To: Click the Browse button and select a folder if you 
want to store the Archive file in a certain location.
 
✦ Permanently Delete Old Items: Select this option if you want to delete, 
not archive, old items.
Archiving rules for a folder
Choose among these options to establish archiving rules for a specific folder 
(refer to Figure 1-6):
 
✦ Do Not Archive Items in This Folder: Select this option if items in the 
folder aren’t worth archiving.
 
✦ Archive Items in This Folder Using the Default Settings: Select this 
option to defer to the default archiving rules for the folder.
 
✦ Archive This Folder Using These Settings: Select this option to estab-
lish archiving rules for the folder.
 
✦ Clean Out Items Older Than: Choose a cutoff time period after which to 
archive the items in the folder.
 
✦ Move Old Items To: Click the Browse button and select a folder if you 
want to store the archived items in a specific location.
 
✦ Permanently Delete Old Items: Select this option if you want to delete, 
not archive, items in this folder.
 
Besides archiving, another way to remove bric-a-brac automatically is to 
take advantage of the Rules Wizard to delete certain kinds of messages when 
they arrive. See Chapter 3 of this mini-book for more information.

Running the Mailbox Cleanup command
The Mailbox Cleanup command is an all-purpose command for finding e-mail 
messages, archiving items, deleting items, and deleting alternate versions of 
items. To use the command, go to the File tab, choose Info, click the Cleanup 
Tools button, and choose Mailbox Cleanup. You see the Mailbox Cleanup 
dialog box shown in Figure 1-7. The dialog box offers a speedy entrée into 
these different Outlook tasks:
 
✦ Seeing how much hard drive space folders occupy: Click the View 
Mailbox Size button and then take note of folder sizes in the Folder Size 
dialog box.
 
Figure 1-7:

✦ Finding items: Select an option button to find items older than a cer-
tain number of days or larger than a certain number of kilobytes, enter 
a days or kilobytes number, and click the Find button. You land in 
the Advanced Find dialog box. Earlier in this chapter, “Conducting an 
advanced search” explains this dialog box. Use it to select items and 
delete them.
 
✦ Archiving items: Click the AutoArchive button to archive items in your 
folders. See “Archiving the old stuff” in this chapter for details.
 
✦ Emptying the deleted items folder: Click the Empty button to empty the 
Deleted Items folder. See “Deleting E-Mail Messages, Contacts, Tasks, 
and Other Items,” earlier in this chapter.

Chapter 2: Maintaining 
the Contacts Folder
In This Chapter
✓ Recording information about a new contact
✓ Creating a contact group
✓ Locating a contact in the Contacts folder
✓ Printing contact information in the Contacts folder
I
n pathology (the study of diseases and how they’re transmitted) a contact 
is a person who passes on a communicable disease, but in Outlook, a 
contact is someone about whom you keep information. Information about 
contacts is kept in the Contacts folder. This folder is a super-powered 
address book. It has places for storing people’s names, addresses, phone 
numbers, e-mail addresses, Web pages, pager numbers, birthdays, anni-
versaries, nicknames, and other stuff besides. When you enter an e-mail 
address, you can get it straight from the Contacts folder to be sure that the 
address is entered correctly. As I explain in Book II, Chapter 5, you can also 
get addresses from the Contacts folder when you generate form letters, 
labels, and envelopes for mass mailings in Word.
This short but happy chapter explains how to maintain a tried-and-true 
Contacts folder, enter information about people in the folder, create contact 
groups to make sending the same message to many people easier, find a 
missing contact, and print the information in the Contacts folder.
Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
A Contacts folder is only as good and as thorough as the information about 
contacts that you put into it. These pages explain how to enter information 
about a contact and update the information if it happens to change.
Don’t despair if you have been using another software program to track 
addresses. Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains how to import those 
addresses into Outlook without having to reenter them.

304
Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
Entering a new contact in the Contacts folder
To place someone in the Contacts List, open the Contacts folder and start by 
doing one of the following:
 
 
✦ Click the New Contact button.
 
 
✦ Press Ctrl+N (in the Contacts Folder window) or Ctrl+Shift+C (in another 
window).
You see the Contact form, as shown in Figure 2-1. In this form are places for 
entering just about everything there is to know about a person except his 
or her favorite color and secret vices. Enter all the information you care to 
record, keeping in mind these rules of the road as you go along:
 
Figure 2-1: 
A Contact 
form.
 
 
✦ Full names, addresses, and so on: Although you may be tempted to 
simply enter addresses, phone numbers, names, and so on in the text 
boxes, don’t do it! Click the Full Name button, for example, to enter a 
name (refer to Figure 2-1). Click the Business or Home button to enter an 
address in the Check Address dialog box (refer to Figure 2-1). By clicking 
these buttons and entering data in dialog boxes, you permit Outlook to 
separate the component parts of names, addresses, and phone numbers. 
As such, Outlook can use names and addresses as a source for mass 
mailings and mass e-mailings.

Book III
Chapter 2
Maintaining the 
Contacts Folder
305
Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
 
 When entering information about a company, not a person, leave the 
Full Name field blank and enter the company’s name in the Company 
field.
 
✦ Information that matters to you: If the form doesn’t appear to have a place 
for entering a certain kind of information, try clicking a triangle button and 
choosing a new information category from the pop-up menu. Click the tri-
angle button next to the Business button and choose Home, for example, if 
you want to enter a home address rather than a business address.
 
✦ File As: Open the File As drop-down list and choose an option for filing 
the contact in the Contacts folder. Contacts are filed alphabetically by 
last name, first name, company name, or combinations of the three. 
Choose the option that best describes how you expect to find the con-
tact in the Contacts folder.
 
✦ Mailing addresses: If you keep more than one address for a contact, 
display the address to which you want to send mail and select the This 
Is the Mailing Address check box. This way, in a mass mailing, letters are 
sent to the correct address.
 
✦ E-mail addresses: You can enter up to three e-mail addresses for each 
contact. (Click the triangle button next to the E-mail button and choose 
E-mail 2 or E-mail 3 to enter a second or third address.) In the Display As 
text box, Outlook shows you what the To: line of e-mail messages looks 
like when you send e-mail to a contact. By default, the To: line shows 
the contact’s name followed by his or her e-mail address in parenthe-
ses. However, you can enter whatever you want in the Display As text 
box, and if entering something different helps you distinguish between 
e-mail addresses, enter something different. For example, enter Lydia – 
Personal so that you can tell when you send e-mail to Lydia’s personal 
address as opposed to her business address.
 
✦ Photos: To put a digital photo in a Contact form, click the Add Contact 
Photo placeholder, and in the Add Contact Picture dialog box, select a 
picture and click OK.
 
 
✦ Details: To keep a detailed dossier on a contact, click the Details button 
(you may have to click the Show button first, depending on the size of 
your Contact form) and enter information in the Details window. This 
window offers places for recording birthdays and other minutia.
 
Be sure to write a few words in the Notes box to describe how and where 
you met the contact. When the time comes to weed out contacts in the 
Contacts folder list, reading these descriptions helps you decide who gets 
weeded and who doesn’t.
 
 When you finish entering information, click the Save & Close button. If you’re 
in a hurry to enter contacts, click the Save & New button. Doing so opens an 
empty form so that you can record information about another contact.

306
Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Contacts Folder
 
Here’s a fast way to enter contact information for someone who has sent you 
an e-mail message: Open the message, right-click the sender’s name in the 
From: line, and choose Add to Outlook Contacts on the shortcut menu. You 
see the Contact form. Enter more information about the sender if you can 
and then click the Save & Close button.
Changing a contact’s information
 
 Changing a contact’s information is a chore if you do it by going from field to 
field in the General or Details window of the Contact form. A faster way to 
update the information you have about a contact is to click the All Fields 
button and enter the information in the All Fields window, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. The All Fields window lists fields in a line-by-line fashion. Choose 
an option on the Select From drop-down list, scroll in the form, and update 
fields as necessary.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Editing 
data in the 
All Fields 
window.
 
Mapping out an address
To find your way to a contact’s home or place 
of business, click the Map It button in the 
Contact form window (or click the More button 
and choose Map It). As long as your computer 
is connected to the Internet and an address 
is on file for the contact, your Web browser 
opens to the Bing.com Web site, where you 
find a map with the address at its center. You 
can get driving directions from this map. Good 
luck getting there!

Contact Groups for Sending Messages to Groups
Contact Groups for Sending Messages to Groups
The captain of the volleyball team and the secretary of the PTA are examples 
of people who have to send e-mail messages to the same group of people 
on a regular basis. You might be in the same boat. You might have to send 
e-mail messages to the same 10 or 12 people from time to time. Entering 
e-mail addresses for that many people each time you want to send e-mail is a 
drag. To keep from having to enter so many e-mail addresses, you can create 
a contact group, a list with multiple e-mail addresses. To address your e-mail 
message, you simply enter the name of the contact group, not the individual 
names, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Instead of 
entering 
many 
addresses 
(top), enter 
a contact 
group name 
(bottom).
 
Creating a contact group
Follow these steps to bundle e-mail addresses into a contact group:
 
 1. On the Home tab, click the New Contact Group button (or press 
Ctrl+Shift+L).
 
 
 You see the Contact Group window, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name text box.

 3. Click the Add Members button and choose an option on the drop-
down list to tell Outlook where you store the addresses of friends and 
colleagues.
 
 If you’re a loyal user of Outlook, you likely choose From Outlook 
Contacts. You see the Select Members dialog box.
 
4. Hold down the Ctrl key and select the name of each person you want 
to include in the contact group.
 
5. Click the Members button and click OK.
 
 You can find the Members button in the lower-left corner of the dialog 
box. The names you chose appear in the Contact Group window.
 
 You can add the names of people who aren’t in your Contacts folder by 
clicking the Add Members button, choosing New E-Mail Contact on the 
drop-down list, and filling out the Add New Member dialog box.
 
 6. Click the Save & Close button in the Contact Group window.
 
 In the Contacts folder, contact group names appear in boldface and are 
marked with the Contact group icon.
Addressing e-mail to a contact group
To address an e-mail message to a contact group, start in the Inbox folder 
and click the New E-Mail button. A Message window opens. Click the To 
button to open the Select Names dialog box and then select a contact group 
name. Contact group names appear in boldface and are marked with a 
Contact Group icon.
Editing a contact group
The names of contact groups appear in the Contacts folder, where they are 
boldfaced and marked with an icon showing two heads in profile. You can 
treat the groups like regular contacts. In the Contacts folder, double-click a 
contact group name to open the Contact Group window (refer to Figure 2-4). 
From there, you can add names to and remove names from the group.

Finding a Contact in the Contacts Folder
The Contacts folder can grow very large, so Outlook offers a number of ways 
to locate contacts. After you find the contact you’re looking for, double-click 
the contact’s name to open the Contact form window. Here are some tech-
niques for locating a contact in the Contacts folder:
 
✦ Use the scrollbar: Click the arrows or drag the scroll box to move 
through the list.
 
✦ Click a letter button: Click a letter button on the right side of the 
window to move in the list to names beginning with a specific letter.
 
✦ Change views: On the Home tab, go to the Current View gallery and 
choose a view option: Business Card, Card, Phone, or List. Changing 
views often helps in a search.
 
✦ Type a name in the Find a Contact text box: On the Home tab, enter a 
name or e-mail address in this text box and press Enter.
 
✦ Search Contacts text box: Enter a keyword in the Search Contacts text 
box (see Chapter 1 of this mini-book for instructions about searching for 
items in folders).
 
✦ Search by category: Categorize contacts as you enter them and switch 
to By Category view to arrange contacts by category (see Chapter 1 of 
this mini-book for information about categories).
Printing the Contacts Folder
The paperless office hasn’t arrived yet in spite of numerous predictions to 
the contrary, and sometimes it’s necessary to print the Contacts folder on 
old-fashioned paper. For times like these, I hereby explain the different ways 
to print the Contacts folder and how to fiddle with the look of the printed 
pages.
 
To print information about a single contact, double-click his or her name to 
open the Contact window. Then press Ctrl+P, and in the Print window, click 
the Print button.
Different ways to print contact information
Follow these steps to print information about contacts in the Contacts 
folder:
 
1. On the Home tab, open the Current View gallery and choose a view.
 
 Which printing options you get when you print information from the 
Contacts folder depends on which view of the Contacts folder is show-
ing when you give the command to print:

310
Printing the Contacts Folder
 
• If you start in Business Card or Card view, you can print Contact 
information in these styles: card style, booklet style, memo style, or 
phone directory style (you find out what these styles are shortly).
 
• If you start in Phone or List view, your printing choices are narrower 
because you can print only in table style.
 
2. Press Ctrl+P.
 
 You see the Print window, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
3. Under Settings, choose an option.
 
 Glance at the right side of the window to see what the option choices 
are and choose the option that suits you best.
 
4. Click the Print Options button if you want to change the number of 
columns that are printed, change fonts, change headers and footers, 
or otherwise fiddle with the printed pages.
 
 The next section in this chapter explains these options.
 
5. Click the Print button to start printing.

Changing the look of printed pages
To determine what Contact folder information looks like when you print it, 
click the Print Options button in the Print window (refer to Figure 2-5). You 
see the Print dialog box. In this dialog box, click the Page Setup button and 
choose options on the Format tab of the Page Setup dialog box to change the 
look of the printed pages:
 
✦ Where contact information is printed: Contact information is printed 
alphabetically with a letter heading to mark where the As, Bs, Cs, and 
so on begin. To place contacts that begin with each letter on separate 
pages, select the Start on a New Page option button.
 
✦ Number of columns: Enter a number in the Number of Columns text box 
to tell Outlook how many columns you want.
 
✦ Contact index: Select the Contact Index on Side check box to print 
thumbnail letter headings on the sides of pages.
 
✦ Letter headings: To remove the letter headings that mark where con-
tacts starting with a certain letter begin, deselect the Headings for Each 
letter check box.
 
✦ Fonts and font sizes: Click a Font button and choose a different font or 
font size for headings and body text.
 
✦ Gray shades: Gray shades appear behind contact names, but you can 
remove them by deselecting the Print Using Gray Shading check box.
In the Header/Footer tab, the three boxes are for deciding what appears on 
the left side, middle, and right side of headers and footers. Type whatever 
you please into these text boxes. You can also click buttons in the dialog box 
to enter fields — a page number, total page number, printing date, printing 
time, or your name — in headers or footers.

Chapter 3: Handling Your E-Mail
In This Chapter
✓ Addressing, sending, replying to, and forwarding e-mail messages
✓ Sending files and pictures with e-mail
✓ Understanding the HTML, plain text, and rich text format
✓ Receiving e-mail and files over the Internet
✓ Organizing and managing your e-mail
✓ Creating and using different folders to store e-mail
✓ Preventing junk e-mail
“N
either snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these 
couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds,” 
reads the inscription on the Eighth Avenue New York Post Office Building. 
E-mailers face a different set of difficulties. Instead of snow, rain, or gloomy 
nights, they face the task of having to manage volumes of e-mail.
This chapter explains the basics of sending and receiving e-mail, but it also 
goes a step further to help you organize and manage your e-mail messages. 
It shows you how to send files and pictures with e-mail messages, and post-
pone sending a message. You can also find out how to be advised when 
someone has read your e-mail, reorganize e-mail in the Inbox window, and 
be alerted to incoming messages from certain people or from people writing 
about certain subjects. This chapter shows you how to create folders for 
storing e-mail and explains how to prevent junk e-mail from arriving on your 
digital doorstep.
Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
Sorry, you can’t send chocolates or locks of hair by e-mail, but you can send 
digital pictures and computer files. These pages explain how to do it. You 
also discover how to send copies and blind copies of e-mail messages, reply 
to and forward e-mail, send e-mail from different accounts, and postpone 
sending a message. Better keep reading.

314
Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
The basics: Sending an e-mail message
The first half of this chapter addresses everything you need to know about 
sending e-mail messages. Here are the basics:
 
 1. In the Inbox or Drafts folder, click the New E-Mail button or press 
Ctrl+N.
 
 
 A Message window like the one in Figure 3-1 appears. You can open this 
window in a folder apart from the Inbox or Drafts folder by clicking the New 
Items button and choosing E-Mail Message on the drop-down list (or by 
pressing Ctrl+Shift+M). The New Items button is located on the Home tab.
 
2. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To text box.
 
 The next topic in this chapter, “Addressing an e-mail message,” explains 
the numerous ways to address an e-mail message. You can address 
the same message to more than one person by entering more than one 
address in the To text box. For that matter, you can send copies of the 
message and blind copies of the message to others (see “Sending copies 
and blind copies of messages,” later in this chapter).
 
3. In the Subject text box, enter a descriptive title for the message.
 
 When your message arrives on the other end, the recipient sees the 
subject first. Enter a descriptive subject that helps the recipient decide 
whether to read the message right away. After you enter the subject, it 
appears in the title bar of the Message window.
 
 Outlook offers different ways to get a recipient’s attention. For exam-
ple, you can give your message a priority rating. See the sidebar, 
“Prioritizing the messages you send,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Type the message.
 
 Whatever you do, don’t forget to enter the message itself! You can spell-
check your message by pressing F7 or clicking the Spelling & Grammar 
button on the Review tab.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
 
 As long as you compose messages in HTML format and the person 
receiving your e-mail messages has software capable of reading HTML, 
you can decorate messages to your heart’s content (later in this chap-
ter, “All about Message Formats” explains the HTML issue). Experiment 
with fonts and font sizes. Boldface and underline text. Throw in a bul-
leted or numbered list. You can find many formatting commands in the 
Insert, Options, and Format Text tabs. These are the same formatting 
commands found in Word.
 
 5. Click the Send button (or press Alt+S).
 
 
 As “Postponing sending a message” explains later in this chapter, you 
can put off sending a message. And if you have more than one e-mail 
account, you can choose which one to send the message with, as 
“Choosing which account to send messages with” explains. Messages 
remain in the Outbox folder if you postpone sending them or if Outlook 
can’t send them right away because your computer isn’t connected to 
the Internet.
 
If you decide in the middle of writing a message to write the rest of it later, 
click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar (or press Ctrl+S) and close 
the Message window. The message lands in the Drafts folder. When you’re 
ready to finish writing the message, open the Drafts folder and double-click 
your unfinished message to resume writing it.
Copies of the e-mail messages you send are kept in the Sent Items folder. If 
you prefer not to keep copies of sent e-mail messages on hand, click the File 
tab and choose Options. On the Mail category of the Options dialog box, 
deselect the Save Copies of Messages in Sent Items Folder check box.
Making Outlook your default e-mail program
If you switched to Outlook from Outlook Express 
or another e-mail program and you like Outlook, 
you need to tell your computer that Outlook is 
henceforward the e-mail program you want to 
use by default. The default e-mail program is 
the one that opens when you click an e-mail 
hyperlink on a Web page or give the order to 
send an Office file from inside an Office pro-
gram. Follow these steps to make Outlook the 
default e-mail program on your computer:
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Options.
 2. In the Outlook Options dialog box, visit the 
General category.
 3. Select the Make Outlook the Default 
Program for E-Mail, Contacts, and 
Calendar check box.
 4. Click OK.

316
Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
Addressing an e-mail message
How do you address an e-mail message in the To text box of the Message 
window (refer to Figure 3-1)? Let me count the ways:
 
✦ Get the address (or addresses) from the Contacts folder: Click the To (or 
Cc) button to send a message to someone whose name is on file in your 
Contacts folder. You see the Select Names dialog box, as shown in Figure 
3-2. Click or Ctrl+click to select the names of people to whom you want 
to send the message. Then click the To-> button (or the Cc-> or Bcc-> 
button) to enter addresses in the To text box (or the Cc or Bcc text boxes) 
of the Message window. Click OK to return to the Message window. This is 
the easiest way to address an e-mail message to several different people.

✦ Type a person’s name from the Contacts folder: Simply type a person’s 
name. If the name is on file in the Contacts folder, a drop-down list with 
the name appears, and you can select the name on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Type the address: Type the address if you know it offhand. You can 
paste an address into the Message window by right-clicking and choos-
ing the Paste command.
 
✦ Reply to a message sent to you: Select the message in the Inbox folder 
and click the Reply button. The Message window opens with the address 
of the person to whom you’re replying already entered in the To text 
box. You can also click the Reply All button to reply to enter the e-mail 
addresses of all the people to whom the original message was sent.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
You can create contact groups for sending the same e-mail message to a 
group of people without having to enter an address for each recipient. For 
information about contact groups, see Chapter 2 of this mini-book.
 
These days, many people have more than one e-mail address, and when you 
enter an e-mail address in the To text box of the Message window, it’s hard to 
be sure whether the address you entered is the right one. To make sure that 
you send e-mail to the right address, go to the Message tab and click the Check 
Names button (or press Ctrl+K). You see the Check Names dialog box. Select the 
correct name and address in the dialog box and then click OK.
Sending copies and blind copies of messages
When you send a copy of a message, the person who receives the message 
knows that copies have been sent because the names of people to whom 
copies were sent appear at the top of the e-mail message. But when you send 
blind copies, the person who receives the message doesn’t know that others 
received it.
Sending e-mail from inside another Office program
As long as Outlook is your default e-mail pro-
gram (I explain how to make it the default 
program earlier in this chapter), you can send 
e-mail messages or file attachments from other 
Office programs without opening Outlook. If the 
Word document, Excel worksheet, PowerPoint 
presentation, or Publisher publication needs 
sending right away, save it and follow these 
steps to send it as a file attachment to an e-mail 
message:
 1. With the file you want to send on-screen, 
go to the File tab and choose Save & Send.
 2. In the Save & Send window, choose Send 
Using E-Mail.
 3. Choose a Send option.
 
 These options differ from program to pro-
gram. For example, you can send the file 
as an attachment to an e-mail message or 
send it as a PDF file. The Message window 
appears after you choose a Send option.
 4. Enter the recipient’s address in the To box 
and type a message in the Message box.
 5. Click the Send button.
 
 That was fast! It was faster than opening 
Outlook and attaching the file to the e-mail 
message on your own. The message is sent 
right away if Outlook is running. Otherwise, 
the message is sent next time you open 
Outlook.

318
Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
Follow these instructions to send copies and blind copies of messages:
 
✦ Send a copy of a message: Enter e-mail addresses in the Cc text box of 
the Message window, or in the Select Names dialog box (refer to Figure 
3-2), select names and then click the Cc-> button.
 
✦ Send a blind copy of a message: On the Options tab, click the Bcc 
button, or click the To or Cc button in the Message window to open the 
Select Names dialog box (refer to Figure 3-2), select names, and click the 
Bcc-> button or else enter addresses in the Bcc-> text box.
You may well ask why these buttons are called Cc and Bcc. Why the extra C? 
The Cc stands for ”carbon copy” and the Bcc stands for ”blind carbon copy.” 
These terms originated in the Mesozoic era when letters were composed on 
the typewriter, and to make a copy of a letter, you inserted carbon paper 
between two paper sheets and typed away.
Replying to and forwarding e-mail messages
Replying to and forwarding messages is as easy as pie. For one thing, you 
don’t need to know the recipient’s e-mail address to reply to a message. In 
the Inbox, select or open the message you want to reply to or forward and 
do the following on the Home tab or Message tab:
 
 
✦ Reply to author: Click the Reply button (or press Ctrl+R). The Message 
window opens with the sender’s name already entered in the To box and 
the original message in the text box below. Write a reply and click the 
Send button.
 
 
✦ Reply to all parties who received the message: Click the Reply All button 
(or press Ctrl+Shift+R). The Message window opens with the names of all 
parties who received the message in the To and Cc boxes and the original 
message in the text box. Type your reply and click the Send button.
 
 
✦ Forward a message: Click the Forward button (or press Ctrl+F). The 
Message window opens with the text of the original message. Either 
enter an e-mail address in the To text box or click the To button to open 
the Select Names dialog box and then select the names of the parties to 
whom the message will be forwarded. Add a word or two to the original 
message if you like; then click the Send button.
 
 Forwarding a message to a third party without the permission of the 
original author is a breach of etiquette and very bad manners. I could 
tell you a story about an e-mail message of mine that an unwitting editor 
forwarded to a cantankerous publisher, but I’m saving that story for the 
soap opera edition of this book.
 
To add a sender’s name to the Contacts folder, right-click the name in the 
Message window and choose Add to Outlook Contacts.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
Sending a file along with a message
Sending a file along with an e-mail message is called attaching a file in 
Outlook lingo. Yes, it can be done. You can send a file or several files along 
with an e-mail message by following these steps:
 
 1. In the Message window open, go to the Message or Insert tab and click 
the Attach File button.
 
 
 You see the Insert File dialog box.
 
2. Locate and select the file that you want to send along with your e-mail 
message.
 
 Ctrl+click filenames to select more than one file.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 The name of the file (or files) appears in the Attached text box in the 
Message window. Address the message and type a note to send along with 
the file. You can right-click a filename in the Attach text box and choose 
Open on the shortcut menu to open a file you’re about to send. Or, if you 
change your mind about sending the file, you can click Remove.
 
Here’s a fast way to attach a file to a message: Find the file in Windows 
Explorer and drag it into the Message window. The file’s name appears in the 
Attach box as though you placed it there by clicking the Attach File button.
Prioritizing the messages you send
Every day, billions of e-mail messages arrive 
on people’s computers, each one begging for 
the recipient’s attention, each one crying out, 
“Read me first.” With this kind of cutthroat 
competition, how can you give your e-mail 
messages a competitive advantage? How can 
you make yours stand out in the crowd?
The best way is to write a descriptive title in 
the Subject box of the Message window. The 
subject is the first thing people see in their 
Inbox. They decide whether to read a message 
now, later, or never on the basis of what they 
see on the Subject line.
Another way to (maybe) get other’s attention 
is to assign a high priority rating to your mes-
sage. If the recipient reads his or her e-mail 
with Outlook or Outlook Express, a red excla-
mation point appears beside the message in 
the Inbox folder. Conversely, you can assign a 
low priority to messages as well, in which case 
a downward-pointing arrow appears next to 
the message heading in the Inbox folder. 
However, prioritizing this way is only worth-
while if the recipient runs Outlook or Outlook 
Express because other e-mail programs don’t 
know what to make of the exclamation point 
or the arrow.
To assign a priority to a message, go to the 
Message tab in the Message window and 
click the High Importance or Low Importance 
button. In the Inbox folder, click the Sort By 
Importance button, the leftmost sorting button, 
to arrange messages by their priority ratings.

Addressing and Sending E-Mail Messages
Including a picture in an e-mail message
As shown in Figure 3-3, you can include a picture in the body of an e-mail 
message, but in order to see it, the recipient’s e-mail software must display 
messages by using HTML. As “All about Message Formats” explains later in 
this chapter, not everyone has software that displays e-mail by using HTML. 
People who don’t have HTML e-mail software get the picture anyhow, but it 
doesn’t appear in the body of the e-mail message; it arrives as an attached 
file (see “Handling Files That Were Sent to You,” later in this chapter, to find 
out about receiving files by e-mail). To view the attached file, the recipient 
has to open it with a graphics software program, such as Paint or Windows 
Picture and Fax Viewer.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Inserting a 
picture in 
an e-mail 
message.
 
Follow these steps to adorn an e-mail message with a picture:
 
1. In the Message window, go to the Insert tab.
 
2. Click in the body of the e-mail message where you want the picture to go.
 
 3. Click the Picture button.
 
 
 You see the Insert Picture dialog box.
 
4. Locate and select the digital picture you want to send; then click the 
Insert button.
 
 The picture lands in the Message window. Select the picture, go to the 
(Picture Tools) Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Wrap Text 
button, and choose an option to decide how text should behave nearby 
the picture. Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains graphics in detail; Book I, 
Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate graphic images.

Delete key.
Choosing which account to send messages with
If you have more than one e-mail account, you can choose which one to send 
an e-mail message with. Follow these instructions to choose an account for 
sending e-mail messages:
 
✦ Choosing the default account for sending messages: When you click the 
Send button in the Message window, the e-mail message is sent by way 
of the default e-mail account. To tell Outlook which account that is, go to 
the File tab, choose Info, click the Account Settings button, and choose 
Account Settings on the drop-down list. You see the Account Settings 
dialog box. Select the account that you want to be the default and click 
the Set As Default button.
 
✦ Sending an individual message: To bypass the default e-mail account 
and send a message with a different account, click the Account button in 
the Message window, and choose an account name from the drop-down 
list. Then click the Send button.
Postponing sending a message
As you probably know, e-mail messages are sent immediately when you click 
the Send button in the Message window if your computer is connected to the 
Internet. If it isn’t connected, the message lands in the Outbox folder, where 
it remains until you connect to the Internet.
But suppose you want to postpone sending a message? Outlook offers two 
techniques for putting off sending a message:
 
✦ Moving messages temporarily to the Drafts folder: Compose your mes-
sage, click the Save button in the Message window (or press Ctrl+S), and 
close the Message window. Your e-mail message goes to the Drafts folder. 
When you’re ready to send it, open the Drafts folder, double-click your 
message to open it, and click the Send button in the Message window.
 
 
✦ Postponing the send date: On the Options tab in the Message window, 
click the Delay Delivery button. You see the Properties dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 3-4. Select the Do Not Deliver Before check box, enter a 
date on the calendar, and if you so desire, select a time from the drop-
down list. Then click the Close button. In the Message window, click the 
Send button. Your message goes to the Outbox folder, where it remains 
until the time arrives to send it and you open Outlook.

Being Advised When Someone Has Read Your E-mail

Being Advised When Someone Has Read Your E-Mail
Outlook offers a command whereby you can be informed when someone 
has received or read an e-mail message you sent. You can even send a mini-
ballot to someone else, solicit their vote, and have the vote sent to you by 
e-mail. To perform this magic trick, start in the Message window and go to 
the Options tab. In the Tracking group, select one or more of these options:
 
 
✦ Use Voting Buttons: Voting buttons are included on a drop-down list in 
the e-mail message you send. Choose a set of buttons from the drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 3-5. The recipient clicks the Vote button, 
chooses an option on a drop-down list, and the response is sent to you 
in the form of an e-mail message with the word Approve, Reject, Yes, No, 
or Maybe in the subject line.
 
✦ Request a Delivery Receipt: You’re informed by e-mail after the mes-
sage is delivered. Select the Request a Delivery Receipt check box. To be 
informed, however, you and the recipient must use the same Exchange 
Server, and the recipient must choose to inform you that the message 
was delivered. Don’t count on this one really working.
 
✦ Request a Read Receipt: The message box appears, as shown in Figure 
3-5. If the recipient clicks the Yes button, a Message window appears 
immediately so that he or she can send an e-mail informing you that the 
message was read. The message, when it arrives on your end, lists the 
date and time that the response message was sent. Select the Request a 
Read Receipt check box.

All about Message Formats
 
Outlook offers three formats for sending e-mail messages: HTML, plain text, 
and rich text. What are the pros and cons of the different formats? How do I 
choose a format for my e-mail messages? I’m so glad you asked.
The three message formats
Outlook offers these three formats for sending e-mail messages:
 
✦ HTML format: These days, almost all e-mail is transmitted in HTML 
(HyperText Markup Language) format, the same format with which 
Web pages are made. If HTML is the default format you use for creating 
messages in Outlook — and it is unless you tinkered with the default 
settings — the e-mail messages you send are, in effect, little Web pages. 
HTML gives you the most opportunities for formatting text and graph-
ics. In HTML format, you can place pictures in the body of an e-mail 
message, use a background theme, and do any number of sophisticated 
formatting tricks.
 
✦ Plain text format: In plain text format, only letters and numbers are 
transmitted. The format doesn’t permit you to format text or align 
paragraphs in any way, but you can rest assured that the person who 
receives the message can read it exactly as you wrote it.
 
✦ Rich text format: The third e-mail message format, rich text, is propri-
etary to Microsoft e-mailing software. Only people who use Outlook and 
Outlook Express can read messages in rich text format, and I don’t rec-
ommend it for that reason.

324
Receiving E-Mail Messages
 
When someone sends you an e-mail message, you can tell which format it 
was transmitted in by looking at the title bar, where HTML, Plain Text, or 
Rich Text appears in parentheses after the subject of the message. Outlook is 
smart enough to transmit messages in HTML, plain text, or rich text format 
when you reply to a message that was sent to you in that format.
Choosing a format for your e-mail messages
Follow these instructions if you need to change the format in which your 
e-mail messages are transmitted:
 
✦ Changing the default format: On the File tab, choose Options. In 
the Options dialog box, go to the Mail category. From the Compose 
Messages in This Format drop-down list, choose HTML, Rich Text, or 
Plain Text.
 
✦ Changing the format for a single e-mail message: In the Message 
window, go to the Format Text tab and click the HTML, Plain Text, or 
Rich Text button.
Receiving E-Mail Messages
Let’s hope that all the e-mail messages you receive carry good news. These 
pages explain how to collect your e-mail and all the different ways that 
Outlook notifies you when e-mail has arrived. You can find several tried-and-
true techniques for reading e-mail messages in the Inbox window. Outlook 
offers a bunch of different ways to rearrange the window as well as the 
messages inside it.
Getting your e-mail
Starting in the Inbox folder on the Send/Receive tab, here are all the different 
ways to collect e-mail messages that were sent to you:
 
✦ Collect all e-mail: Click the Send/Receive All Folders button (or press 
F9). Mail is sent from and delivered to all your e-mail accounts.
 
✦ Collect mail for the Inbox folder only: Click the Update Folder button 
(or press Shift+F9).
 
✦ Send all unsent mail: Click the Send All button.
 
✦ Collect e-mail from a single account (if you have more than one): Click 
the Send/Receive Groups button, and on the drop-down list, choose 
the name of a group or an e-mail account. (See the sidebar, “Groups for 
handling e-mail from different accounts,” later in this chapter to find out 
what groups are.)
 
✦ Collect e-mail automatically every few minutes: Click the Send/Receive 
Groups button and choose Define Send/Receive Groups on the 

Book III

Receiving E-mail Messages
drop-down list. You see the Send/Receive Groups dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. Select a group (groups are explained in the side-
bar, “Groups for handling e-mail from different accounts”), select the 
Schedule an Automatic Send/Receive Every check box, and enter a min-
utes setting. To temporarily suspend automatic e-mail collections, click 
the Send/Receive Groups button and choose Disable Scheduled Send/
Receive.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Handling 
group 
settings.
 
Being notified that e-mail has arrived
Take the e-mail arrival quiz. Winners get the displeasure of knowing that 
they understand far more than is healthy about Outlook. You can tell when 
e-mail has arrived in the Inbox folder because:
A) You hear this sound: ding.
B) The mouse cursor briefly changes to a little envelope.
C) A little envelope appears in the notification area to the left of the 
Windows clock. (You can double-click the envelope to open the Inbox 
folder.)
D) A pop-up desktop alert with the sender’s name, the message’s subject, 
and the text of the message appears briefly on your desktop.
E) All of the above.
The answer is E, “All of the above,” but if four arrival notices strike you as 
excessive, you can eliminate one or two. On the File tab, choose Options, 
and on the Mail tab of the Options dialog box, go the Message Arrival area 
and change the settings.

326
Reading Your E-mail in the Inbox Window
Reading Your E-Mail in the Inbox Window
Messages arrive in the Inbox window, as shown in Figure 3-7. In the window, 
unread messages are shown in boldface type and have envelope icons next 
to their names; messages that you’ve read (or at least opened to view) 
are shown in Roman type and appear beside open envelope icons. In the 
Folder List, a number in parentheses beside the Inbox folder and Deleted 
Items folder tells you how many unread messages are in those folders. (The 
number in square brackets beside the Drafts and Junk E-Mail folders tells 
you how many items, read and unread, are in those folders).
To read a message, select it and look in the Reading pane, or to focus more 
closely on a message, double-click it to open it in a Message window, as 
shown in Figure 3-7.
Groups for handling e-mail from different accounts
Groups are meant to help people who have 
more than one e-mail account handle their 
e-mail. To begin with, all e-mail accounts 
belong to a group called All Accounts. Unless 
you change the default settings, all your e-mail 
accounts belong to the All Accounts group, 
and e-mail is sent by and received from all your 
e-mail accounts at the same time.
If you want to change these default settings, 
go to the Send/Receive tab, click the Send/
Receive Groups button, and choose Define 
Send/Receive Groups on the drop-down list. 
You see the Send/Receive Groups dialog box 
(refer to Figure 3-6). Follow these instructions 
in the dialog box to change how you handle 
e-mail from different accounts:
 ✓ Excluding an account from the All 
Accounts group: Exclude an account if you 
don’t want to collect its e-mail on a regular 
basis. Maybe you want to collect mail from 
this account sporadically. To exclude an 
account, select the All Accounts group and 
click the Edit button. You land in the Send/
Receive Settings – All Accounts dialog box. 
In the Accounts list, select the account you 
want to exclude and deselect the Include 
the Selected Account in this Group check 
box.
 ✓ Creating a new group: Create a new group 
if you want to establish settings for a single 
e-mail account or group of accounts. 
Click the New button in the Send/Receive 
Groups dialog box, enter a name in the 
Send/Receive Group Name dialog box, 
and click OK. You see the Send/Receive 
Settings dialog box. For each account you 
want to include in your new group, select 
an account name and then select the 
Include the Select Account in This Group 
check box.
 ✓ Choosing settings for a group: In the Send/
Receive Groups dialog box, select the 
group whose settings you want to estab-
lish. At the bottom of the dialog box (see 
Figure 3-6), select whether to send and 
receive e-mail when you press F9, whether 
to send and receive automatically every 
few minutes, and whether to send and 
receive when you exit Outlook.

Later in this chapter, “Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages,” explains 
how to organize messages in the Inbox folder. Meanwhile, here are some 
simple techniques you can use on the View tab to unclutter the Inbox folder 
and make messages easier to read:
 
 
✦ Changing your view of messages: Click the Change View button and 
choose Compact, Single, or Preview on the drop-down list. Compact and 
Single display more messages on-screen. In Preview view, the first two 
lines of unread messages appear so that you can read them.
 
✦ Rearranging messages: Open the Arrange By gallery and choose an 
option. For example, choose Date to arrange messages according to the 
date and time they were received. Choose From to arrange messages 
by sender name in alphabetical order. Click the Reverse Sort button to 
reverse the way the messages are arranged.
 
 
✦ Arranging messages by group: After you choose a means of arranging 
messages, open the Arrange By gallery and select or deselect the Show in 
Groups option. Grouped items appear under headings. For example, if you 
choose From to arrange messages by sender, messages are displayed 
under senders’ names when you select the Show in Groups option.

328
Reading Your E-Mail in the Inbox Window
 
 You can expand and collapse groups by clicking the triangle buttons 
beside their names or by clicking the Expand/Collapse button and 
making a choice on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Arranging messages by conversation: If you arrange messages by date, 
you can also arrange messages by conversation, as shown in Figure 3-8. 
A conversation is a back-and-forth collection of e-mails between the same 
two people or group of people about the same subject. Click the Show 
As Conversations check box, click the Conversation Settings button, and 
choose options on the drop-down list to view e-mails in conversation 
groups.
 
 
✦ Hiding and displaying the Reading pane: Click the Reading Pane button 
and choose Off, Right, or Bottom on the drop-down list to make the 
Reading pane appear or disappear. The Reading pane gives you an oppor-
tunity to read messages without opening them in a Message window.
 
 
✦ Hiding and displaying the Navigation pane: Click the Navigation Pane 
button and choose Normal or Minimized (or press Alt+F1). By hiding the 
Navigation pane, you get even more room to display messages.

Handling Files That Were Sent to You
You can tell when someone sends you files along with an e-mail message 
because the paper clip icon appears in the Attachment column of the Inbox 
window (if column headings are displayed), as shown in Figure 3-9. The 
name of the file that was sent to you appears in the Reading pane (if the 
Reading pane is open) and in the Message window as well if you open the 
message in a window.

Click to save files
Right-click to handle incoming files
 
Files that are sent to you land deep inside your computer in a subfolder of 
the Temporary Internet Files folder where you will never find them. The best 
way to handle an incoming file is to save it right away to a folder where you 
can find it when you need it.
Saving a file you received
To save a file that was sent to you and stash it in a folder of your choice, do 
one of the following:

330
Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
 
 
✦ Click to select the filename, and on the (Attachment Tools) 
Attachments tab, click the Save As button and save the file using the 
Save Attachment dialog box. Click the Save All Attachments button to 
save more than one file.
 
✦ Right-click the filename, choose Save As on the shortcut menu, and save 
the file in the Save Attachment dialog box. Right-click and choose Save 
All Attachments to save more than one file.
Opening a file you received
Use any of the following ways to open a file that was sent to you:
 
✦ Double-click the filename.
 
 
✦ Click to select the filename, and on the (Attachment Tools) Attachments 
tab, click the Open button.
 
✦ Right-click the filename and choose Open on the shortcut menu.
 
If the file you receive is a Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or Publisher file, you can 
preview it inside the Message window or Reading pane. To do so, right-click 
the filename and choose Preview on the shortcut menu.
Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
If you’re one of those unfortunate souls who receives 20, 30, 40 or more e-mail 
messages daily, you owe it to yourself and your sanity to figure out a way to 
organize e-mail messages such that you keep the ones you want, you can find 
e-mail messages easily, and you can quickly eradicate the e-mail messages 
that don’t matter to you. Outlook offers numerous ways to manage and orga-
nize e-mail messages. Pick and choose the techniques that work for you.
In a nutshell, here are all the techniques for organizing e-mail messages:
 
 
✦ Change views in the Inbox window: On the View tab, click the Change 
View button and choose a view. Earlier in this chapter, “Reading Your 
E-Mail in the Inbox Window” explains all the ways to change views.
 
 
✦ Delete the messages that you don’t need: Before they clutter the Inbox, 
delete messages that you’re sure you don’t need as soon as you get 
them. To delete a message, select it and click the Delete button on the 
Home tab, press the Delete key, or right-click and choose Delete.
 
✦ Move messages to different folders: Create a folder for each project 
you’re involved with, and when an e-mail message about a project arrives, 
move it to a folder. See “All about E-Mail Folders,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Move messages automatically to different folders as they arrive: 
Instead of moving messages yourself after they arrive, you can tell 

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail

Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
Outlook to move messages automatically to different folders. See “Rules 
for earmarking messages as they arrive,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Destroy junk mail as it arrives: You can delete junk mail automatically. 
See “Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort Of),” later in this chapter.
 
 
✦ Ignore messages from pesky senders: On the Home tab, select a mes-
sage and click the Ignore button to prevent messages from a sender 
from appearing in the Inbox. Ignored messages go straight to the Deleted 
Items folder.
 
✦ Flag messages: Flag a message with a color-coded flag to let you know to 
follow up on it. See “Flagging e-mail messages,” the next section in this 
chapter.
 
✦ Categorize messages: Assign e-mail messages to categories; then, 
arrange e-mail messages by category in the Inbox window. See Chapter 1 
of this mini-book for info about categorizing items in a folder.
 
✦ Have Outlook remind you to reply to a message: Instruct Outlook to 
make the Reminder message box appear at a date and time in the future 
so that you know to reply to a message. See “Being reminded to take 
care of e-mail messages,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Make liberal use of the Search commands: You can always find a stray 
message with the Search commands. (See Chapter 1 of this mini-book to 
know more about searching for items in folders.)
 
✦ Archive messages you no longer need: Archiving is a good way to strip 
the Inbox folder of items that you don’t need. See Chapter 1 of this mini-
book for more about archiving.
 
✦ Use the Mailbox Cleanup command: This handy command archives 
messages, deletes them, and deletes alternate versions of messages. See 
Chapter 1 of this mini-book for more about the Mailbox Cleanup command.
Flagging e-mail messages
One way to call attention to e-mail messages is to flag them with a color-
coded flag. You can use red flags, for example, to mark urgent messages and 
green flags to mark not-so-important ones. After you flag a message, you 
can arrange messages by their flag status in the Inbox folder. Follow these 
instructions to flag an e-mail message:
 
 
✦ Starting in the Message window: Click the Follow Up button and choose 
a flag on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Starting in the Inbox folder: Select the message, and on the Home tab, 
click the Follow Up button and choose a flag. You can also right-click, 
choose Follow Up, and choose a flag.

Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
To “unflag” a message, click the Follow Up button and choose Clear Flag, or 
right-click and choose Clear Flag. You can also choose Mark Complete to put 
a checkmark where the flag used to be and remind yourself that you’re done 
with the message. Later in this chapter, “Rules for earmarking messages 
as they arrive” explains how you can flag messages automatically as they 
arrive.
Being reminded to take care of e-mail messages
If you know your way around the Calendar and Tasks windows, you know 
that the Reminder message box appears when an appointment or meeting is 
about to take place or a task deadline is about to arrive. What you probably 
don’t know, however, is that you can put the Reminders dialog box to work 
in regard to e-mail messages by following these steps:
 
1. Select the message.
 
 2. Click the Follow Up button and choose Add Reminder.
 
 
 You see the Custom dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10. You can also 
right-click a message and choose Follow Up➪Add Reminder to see the 
dialog box.
 
Figure 3-10:

3. On the Flag To drop-down list, choose an option that describes why 
the e-mail message needs your attention later, or if none of the 
options suits you, enter a description in the Flag To text box.
 
 The description you choose or enter will appear above the message in 
the Reading pane and message window, as well in the Reminder message 
box (refer to Figure 3-10).
 
4. In the Due Date drop-down list, choose when you want the Reminder 
message box to appear.

Techniques for Organizing E-Mail Messages
 
 As Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains in detail, the Reminder message 
box appears 15 minutes before the default due date time.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 When the reminder falls due, you see the Reminder message box (refer 
to Figure 3-10), where you can click the Open Item button to open the 
e-mail message. See Chapter 5 of this mini-book if you need to find out 
how the Reminder message box works.
Rules for earmarking messages as they arrive
To help you organize messages better, Outlook gives you the opportunity 
to mark messages in various ways and even move messages automatically 
as they arrive to folders apart from the Inbox folder. Being able to move 
messages immediately to a folder is a great way to keep e-mail concerning 
different projects separate. If you belong to a newsgroup that sends many 
messages per day, being able to move those messages instantly into their 
own folder is a real blessing because newsgroup messages have a habit of 
cluttering the Inbox folder.
To earmark messages for special treatment, Outlook has you create so-called 
rules. To create a rule, start by trying out the Create Rule command, and if 
that doesn’t work, test-drive the more powerful Rules Wizard.
Simple rules with the Create Rule command
Use the Create Rule command to be alerted when e-mail arrives from a cer-
tain person or the Subject line of a message includes a certain word. You 
can make the incoming message appear in the New Mail Alerts window (as 
shown at the top of Figure 3-11), play a sound when the message arrives, or 
move the message automatically to a certain folder.
Follow these steps to create a simple rule:
 
1. Select an e-mail message from a person whose messages require 
a rule.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Rules button.
 
 
 You see the Create Rule dialog box (refer to Figure 3-11).
 
3. Fill in the dialog box and click OK.
 
 These commands are self-explanatory.
To change or delete a rule, click the Rules button and choose Manage Rules 
& Alerts. On the E-Mail Rules tab of the Rules and Alerts dialog box, select a 
rule and change, copy, or delete it.

Complex rules with the Rules Wizard
Use the Rules Wizard to create complex rules that earmark messages with 
words in the message body or earmark messages sent to contact groups. 
You can also create a rule to flag messages automatically or delete a conver-
sation (the original message and all its replies).
 
 To run the Rules Wizard, go to the Home tab, click the Rules button, and 
choose Manage Rules & Alerts. You see the Rules and Alerts dialog box. On 
the E-Mail Rules tab, click the New Rule button and keep clicking Next in the 
Rules Wizard dialog boxes as you complete the two steps to create a rule:
 
✦ Step 1: Choose the rule you want to create or how you want to be 
alerted in the New Mail Alerts window (refer to Figure 3-11).
 
✦ Step 2: Click a hyperlink to open a dialog box and describe the rule. 
For example, click the Specific Words link to open the Search Text 
dialog box and enter the words that earmark a message. Click the 
Specified link to open the Rules and Alerts dialog box and choose a 
folder to move the messages to. You must click each link in the Step 2 
box to describe the rule.
To edit a rule, double-click it in the Rules and Alerts dialog box and complete 
Steps 1 and 2 all over again.
All about E-Mail Folders
Where Outlook e-mail is concerned, everything has its place and everything 
has its folder. E-mail messages land in the Inbox folder when they arrive. 

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail
335
All About E-Mail Folders
Messages you write go to the Outbox folder until you send them. Copies 
of e-mail messages you send are kept in the Sent Items folder. And you can 
create folders of your own for storing e-mail.
If you’re one of those unlucky people who receive numerous e-mail mes-
sages each day, you owe it to yourself to create folders in which to organize 
e-mail messages. Create one folder for each project you’re working on. That 
way, you know where to find e-mail messages when you want to reply to or 
delete them. These pages explain how to move e-mail messages between 
folders and create folders of your own for storing e-mail.
Moving e-mail messages to different folders
Open or select the message you want to move and use one of these tech-
niques to move an e-mail message to a different folder:
 
 
✦ On the Home tab or Message tab, click the Move button and choose a 
folder name on the drop-down list. If the folder’s name isn’t on the list, 
choose Other Folder and select a folder in the Move Items dialog box.
 
✦ Right-click, choose Move, and select a folder name or choose Other 
Folder and select a folder in the Move Items dialog box.
 
✦ Display the folder you want to receive the message in the Navigation 
pane. Then drag the message from the Inbox to the folder in the 
Navigation pane.
Earlier in this chapter, “Rules for earmarking messages as they arrive” 
explains how to move e-mail messages automatically to folders as e-mail is 
sent to you.
Creating a new folder for storing e-mail
Follow these steps to create a new folder:
 
 1. On the Folder tab, click the New Folder button.
 
 
 You see the Create New Folder dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-12. You 
can also open this dialog box by pressing Ctrl+Shift+E or right-clicking a 
folder in the Folder list and choosing New Folder.
 
2. Select the folder that the new folder will go inside.
 
 To create a first-level folder, select Personal Folders (or the name of the 
topmost folder in the hierarchy).
 
3.  Enter a name for the folder.
 
4. Click OK.

To delete a folder you created, open it, go to the Folder tab, and click the 
Delete Folder button. Items in the folder are deleted along with the folder 
itself. To rename a folder, open it, go to the Folder tab, click the Rename 
Folder button, and enter a new name.

Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort Of)
Outlook maintains a folder called Junk E-Mail especially for storing junk 
e-mail, or spam as the digital variety is sometimes called. E-mail messages 
with certain words or phrases in the Subject line — for free!, money-back 
guarantee, order now — are routed automatically to the Junk E-Mail folder, 
where they needn’t bother you. What’s more, you can add senders’ names to 
the Blocked Senders list and route mail from those senders straight into the 
Junk E-Mail folder.
 
As nice as it is, the Junk E-Mail folder has one fatal flaw — sometimes a legiti-
mate e-mail message finds its way into the folder. From time to time, you 
have to look in the Junk E-Mail folder to see whether something of value is in 
there — and that sort of defeats the purpose of routing messages automati-
cally to the Junk E-Mail folder. You still have to look through all that junk 
e-mail!
Realistically, the only way to prevent getting junk e-mail is to safeguard your 
e-mail address. These pages explain how to help stamp out junk mail in your 
lifetime by using features inside Outlook and taking preventive measures.
Defining what constitutes junk e-mail
Outlook maintains a Safe Senders and Blocked Senders list to help distinguish 
e-mail from junk e-mail. To help Outlook recognize junk e-mail and route it to 
the Junk E-Mail folder, you can take these measures to add addresses to the 
lists:

Book III
Chapter 3
Handling Your 
E-Mail
337
Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort Of)
 
 
✦ Add a sender to the Safe Senders list: Senders on this list are deemed 
legitimate, and their e-mail messages are always routed to the Inbox 
folder. In the Message window or Home tab of a mail folder, click the 
Junk button and choose Never Block Sender. Choose this option if you 
find a legitimate e-mail message in the Junk E-Mail folder.
 
✦ Add an address to the Blocked Senders list: E-mail from senders on 
the Blocked Senders list goes straight to the Junk E-Mail folder. In the 
Message window or Home tab of a mail folder, click the Junk button and 
choose Block Sender.
 
✦ Edit the Safe Senders and Blocked Senders lists: Click the Junk button 
and choose Junk E-Mail Options. The Junk E-Mail Options dialog box 
opens. On the Safe Senders and Blocked Senders tab, select e-mail 
addresses as necessary, and click the Remove button.
To quickly move an e-mail message from the Junk E-Mail folder to the Inbox 
folder, click the Junk button and choose Not Junk on the drop-down list. The 
Mark As Not Junk dialog box appears. Click the Always Trust E-Mail From 
check box and click OK.
Preventive medicine for junk e-mail
 
As zealous as Outlook is about preventing junk e-mail, the program can’t 
really do the job. Junk e-mailers change addresses frequently. They are 
clever about putting words in the subject lines of their messages so that the 
messages aren’t recognized as spam. The only foolproof way to keep your 
e-mail address free of junk e-mail is to follow these suggestions:
 
✦ Use a secondary e-mail address: Create a secondary e-mail account 
and give its e-mail address to businesses and merchants on the Internet 
who might sell your address to spammers or might themselves be spam-
mers. The Internet offers many places to create free Web-based e-mail 
accounts. For example, check out Gmail (http://gmail.google.com) 
and Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). Never give your primary 
e-mail address to strangers.
 
✦ Don’t reply to spam: Don’t reply to junk e-mail messages under any cir-
cumstances. By replying, all you do is alert the spammer to the fact that 
your e-mail address is legitimate, and that makes you a target of even 
more spam.
 
✦ Don’t unsubscribe to junk e-mail messages: Some spam messages con-
tain an Unsubscribe link that you can click to prevent more messages 
from coming. The links are a ruse. All you do by clicking them is make 
spammers aware that your e-mail address is live and therefore worth 
targeting with more spam.
 
✦ Don’t buy anything advertised by spam: Even if the message is selling 
what looks to be a terrific bargain, resist the temptation. By buying, you 
expose yourself to all the risks of replying to junk e-mail.

338
Yes, You Can Prevent Junk Mail (Sort Of)
 
✦ Be careful where (and how) you post your e-mail address: Spammers 
gather e-mail addresses from the Internet. They get the addresses from 
Web pages, newsgroups, chat rooms, and message boards. Harvestware, 
a variety of spamware, can scour the Internet for the telltale “at” symbol 
(@) found in e-mail addresses and copy those addresses back to a spam-
mer’s computer. If you have to post your e-mail address on the Internet, 
get around the problem by putting blank spaces between the letters in 
your address, or spell out the address like so:

Chapter 4: Managing Your 
Time and Schedule
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding how the Calendar works
✓ Going to different dates in the Calendar
✓ Scheduling appointments and events
✓ Rescheduling an activity
✓ Getting different views of your schedule
T
he purpose of the Outlook Calendar is to keep you from arriving a day 
late and a dollar short. Use the Calendar to schedule meetings and 
appointments. Use it to make the most of your time. This chapter explains 
how to go from day to day, week to week, and month to month in the 
Calendar window. It shows you how to schedule and reschedule appoint-
ments and meetings and look at your schedule in different ways.
Introducing the Calendar
 
 Use the Calendar to juggle appointments and meetings, remind yourself 
where you’re supposed to be, and get there on time. Surveying your sched-
ule in the Calendar window is easy. Merely by clicking a button, you can tell 
where you’re supposed to be today, any given day, this week, this work 
week, this month, or any month.
Figure 4-1 shows, for example, someone’s schedule during the work week 
of December 14–18 (a work week comprises Monday through Friday, not 
Monday through Sunday). All you have to do to find out how busy you 
are on a particular day, week, or month is gaze at the Calendar window. 
Whether someone invites you to a meeting or wants to schedule an appoint-
ment, you can open the Calendar and see right away if your schedule per-
mits you to attend the meeting or make the appointment.

Outlook gives you opportunities to categorize meetings and appointments so 
that you can tell at a glance what they’re all about. Moving a meeting or appoint-
ment is simply a matter of dragging it elsewhere in the Calendar window. By 
double-clicking a meeting or appointment in the Calendar window, you can 
open a window to find out where the meeting takes place or read notes you 
jotted down about the meeting. You can even make a bell ring and the Reminder 
message box appear when a meeting or appointment is forthcoming.
 
To make the Task List, an abbreviated Tasks window, appear below the 
Calendar window, go to the View tab, click the To-Do Bar button, and choose 
Task List on the drop-down list. Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains how to 
schedule tasks in the Tasks window.
The Different Kinds of Activities
 
For scheduling purposes, Outlook makes a distinction between appoint-
ments, events, and meetings. Meetings, however, aren’t everybody’s con-
cern. If your computer is connected to a network and the network uses the 
Microsoft Exchange Server, you can use Outlook to invite colleagues on the 
network to come to meetings. But if your computer isn’t on a network, don’t 
bother with meetings. Schedule appointments and events instead. You can 
schedule the following activities:

Book III
Chapter 4
Managing Your 
Time and Schedule
341
Seeing Your Schedule
 
✦ Appointment: An activity that occupies a certain time period on a cer-
tain day. For example, a meeting that takes place between 11 a.m. and 
12 p.m. is an appointment.
 
✦ Recurring appointment: An appointment that takes place daily, weekly, 
or monthly on the same day and same time each day, week, or month. A 
weekly staff meeting is a recurring appointment. The beauty of recurring 
appointments is that Outlook enters them weeks and months in advance 
in the Calendar window. You don’t have to reenter these appointments 
over and over.
 
✦ Event: An activity that lasts all day. A trade show, for example, is an 
event. A birthday is an event. A day spent on vacation is also an event 
(is it ever!). On the Calendar, events and recurring events appear first.
 
✦ Recurring event: An all-day activity that takes place each week, month, 
or year. Unromantic (or forgetful) users of Outlook are hereby advised 
to schedule these recurring events in the Calendar: Valentine’s Day, 
their significant other’s birthday, and first-date and wedding anniversa-
ries. Thanks to Outlook, no one will ever accuse you again of being cold-
hearted or indifferent.
 
✦ Meeting: Same as an appointment except that you can invite others to 
attend. Scheduling meetings isn’t covered in this book. See your network 
administrator for details.
Seeing Your Schedule
Days on which meetings or appointments are scheduled appear in boldface 
in the Date Navigator, the calendar in the upper-right corner of the window 
(refer to Figure 4-1). Following are techniques for getting around in the 
Calendar window and viewing your schedule in different ways.
Going to a different day, week, or month
Use these techniques to go to different days, weeks, or months in the 
Calendar window:
 
 
✦ To today: On the Home tab, click the Today button. Clicking this button 
selects today’s date on your calendar in whatever view you happen to 
be in.
 
 
✦ To the next seven days: On the Home tab, click the Next 7 Days button 
to see the next seven days starting with today’s date.
 
 
✦ To a specific day: Click a day in the Date Navigator in the To-Do bar. 
You can also press Ctrl+G and select a day in the Go To Date dialog box. 
If you don’t see the Date Navigator, go to the View tab, click the To-Do 
Bar button, and choose Date Navigator on the drop-down list.

342
Scheduling Appointments and Events
 
✦ To the previous or next day, work week, week, or month: Click a 
Back or Forward arrow. These arrows are in the upper-left corner of 
the Calendar window and on either side of the month name in the Date 
Navigator.
 
 Here’s a quick way to go from month to month in the Date Navigator: 
Click the month name in the Date Navigator and hold down the mouse 
button. You see a list of month names. Drag the pointer to the name of 
the month you want to go to.
Use the scroll bar on the right side of the window to travel from hour to hour 
in Day view and Work Week view. In Week view and Month view, manipulat-
ing the scroll bar takes you from week to week.
Rearranging the Calendar window
To get a sense of what is expected of you and where you’re supposed to be, 
go to the Home or View tab and click one of these buttons to rearrange your 
view of the Calendar window:
 
✦ Day: Shows today’s date only.
 
✦ Work Week: Shows Monday through Friday of this week.
 
✦ Week: Shows the entire week, Sunday through Saturday.
 
✦ Month: Shows the entire month. In Month view, you can open the 
drop-down list on the Month button and choose a Detail option (Low, 
Medium, or High) to see increasing levels of information about the 
appointments and meetings you’ve scheduled.
Scheduling Appointments and Events
Now that you know how the Calendar window works, the next step is to fill 
the pages of the Calendar with all kinds of busywork. These pages explain 
how to schedule activities, schedule recurring activities, and magically 
transform an e-mail message into a Calendar item. You can find many intrigu-
ing shortcuts on these pages.
Scheduling an activity: The basics
Follow these basic steps to schedule an appointment, recurring appoint-
ment, event, or recurring event:
 
1. Select the day in which you want to schedule the activity.
 
 If the activity occupies a certain time period, you can select the time 
period in Day or Week view and save yourself the trouble of entering a 
time period in the Appointment window. To select a time period, drag 
downward in the Calendar window. To create a half-hour appointment,

simply double-click a half-hour slot in Day or Week view. The 
Appointment dialog box opens with the Start and End time entered 
already.
 
 2. Click the New Appointment button (or press Ctrl+N).
 
 
 As shown in Figure 4-2, you see the Appointment window for naming the 
activity, stating its starting and ending time, and choosing whether you 
want to be alerted to its occurrence. In a folder apart from the Calendar, 
you can display this window by going to the Home tab, clicking the New 
Items button, and choosing Appointment on the drop-down list.

3. Enter information in the Appointment tab.
 
 Enter a subject, location (you can open the drop-down list and choose 
one you’ve entered before), start date and time, and end date and time. 
To enter a recurring event or appointment, click the Recurrence button. 
To enter an event rather than an appointment, click the All Day Event 
check box.
 
 If the appointment time you enter conflicts with an appointment you’ve 
already scheduled, the Appointment window tells you as much. You can 
click the Calendar button to view the calendar and look for open timeslots.
 
4. Open the Reminder drop-down list and choose an option if you want 
to be reminded when the activity is imminent (or choose None if you 
don’t care to be reminded).

344
Scheduling Appointments and Events
 
 Choose an option from the drop-down list to make the Reminder mes-
sage box appear before the activity begins. Chapter 5 of this mini-book 
explains how reminders work.
 
 5. Click the Save & Close button when you finish describing the appoint-
ment or event.
 
 
 The appointment or event is entered in the Calendar window.
Scheduling a recurring appointment or event
 
 To enter a recurring appointment or event, click the Recurrence button in 
the Appointment window (refer to Figure 4-2). You see the Appointment 
Recurrence dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-3. Describe how persistent the 
activity is and click OK:
 
✦ Appointment Time: Enter the starting and ending time, if you didn’t do 
so already in the Appointment form.
 
Figure 4-3: 
My, this 
appointment 
is 
persistent!
 
 
✦ Recurrence Pattern: Use the options and drop-down lists to describe 
how often the activity recurs.
 
✦ Range of Recurrence: Describe when the recurring events will cease 
recurring. Choose the No End Date option button if the activity occurs 
ad infinitum, ad nauseam (that’s Latin for “unto infinity, most nau-
seously”).
In the Calendar window, recurring activities are shown in green and are 
marked by the arrow chasing its tail icon. To change a recurring activity into 
a one-time activity, select the activity in the calendar, go to the (Calendar 
Tools) Appointment Series tab, click the Recurrence button, and in the 
Appointment Recurrence dialog box, click the Remove Recurrence button.

Canceling, Rescheduling, and Altering Activities
Scheduling an event
Select the All Day Event check box in the Appointment window (refer to 
Figure 4-2) to schedule an event, not an appointment. As I explain earlier, an 
event is an activity that lasts all day. In the Calendar, events are listed at the 
start of the day before appointments and meetings.
Canceling, Rescheduling, and Altering Activities
Canceling, rescheduling, and altering appointments and events is pretty 
easy. You can always double-click an activity to open an Appointment or 
Event window and change the particulars there. And you can take advantage 
of these shortcuts:
 
 
✦ Canceling: Select an activity, go the (Calendar Tools) Appointment tab, 
and click the Delete button. When you click the Delete button to cancel a 
recurring activity, a drop-down list appears on the Delete button so that 
you can delete one occurrence of the activity or the entire series.
 
✦ Rescheduling: Drag the activity to a new location in the schedule. 
Release the mouse button when the activity is in the new timeslot.
 
✦ Changing start and end times: In Day, Work Week, or Week view, move 
the pointer over the top or bottom of the activity and start dragging 
when you see the double arrow.
 
✦ Changing the description: Click in the activity’s box and start typing or 
editing.
Using an e-mail message to schedule an appointment
Here’s a neat little trick that can save you time 
when e-mail correspondence has to do with 
scheduling an appointment. To get a head 
start on scheduling, drag the e-mail message 
from the Inbox folder to the Calendar folder in 
the Navigation pane. On the theory that you 
want to schedule an appointment around the 
information in the e-mail message, the 
Appointment window appears on-screen. For 
the subject of the appointment, Outlook enters 
the subject of the e-mail message. The text 
of the e-mail message appears in the window as 
well. Fiddle with the particulars of the appoint-
ment and click the Save & Close button.

In This Chapter
✓ Creating, handling, and managing tasks
✓ Being reminded when deadlines and activities are forthcoming
✓ Jotting down digital notes
T
his short chapter describes some Outlook goodies that were neglected 
in the other chapters of this mini-book. It explains how the Tasks 
window can help you meet your deadlines and how to be alerted when an 
activity is looming, a task deadline is arriving, an e-mail message needs your 
attention, or someone in your Contacts folder needs love and attention. 
Finally, it explain Outlook’s digital stick ’em notes.
Tasks: Seeing What Needs to Get Done
 
 As shown in Figure 5-1, use the Tasks window to see what needs to be done, 
when it’s due, and whether it’s overdue. On this list, due dates clearly show 
how smartly the whip is being cracked and how close you are to meeting or 
missing deadlines. A gray line appears across tasks that are done. Tasks 
that are overdue appear in red. Read on if you want to find out how to enter 
a task, attach a file to a task, and manage tasks in the Tasks window.

button, and choose Right or Bottom on the drop-down list.
Entering a task in the Tasks window
Outlook offers two ways to enter a task in the Tasks window:
 
✦ The fast way: Click at the top of the window where it says “Click here to 
add a new Task,” type a few words to describe the task, press the Tab 
key to go to the Due Date box, and enter the due date there. To enter the 
date, type it or open the drop-down calendar and choose a date there.
 
 
✦ The slow but thorough way: On the Home tab, click the New Task button 
(or press Ctrl+N). You see the Task window, as shown in Figure 5-2. In this 
window are places for describing the task, entering start and due dates, 
describing the task’s status, prioritizing the task, and jotting down notes 
about it. Click the Save & Close button when you finish describing the task.

By clicking the Recurrence button in the Task window, you can enter 
a Sisyphean task that gets repeated over and over again. In the Task 
Recurrence dialog box, describe how often the task recurs. Recurring tasks 
are marked in the Tasks window with an unusual icon. What is that? Looks 
to me like a clipboard with a piece of toilet paper stuck to it.

a task.
 
Click the Details button in the Task window to track the hours you worked 
on a project, the companies you worked for, and how many miles you logged 
going to and fro in your work.
Attaching a file to a task is a neat way to get 
down to work quickly. Instead of fumbling in 
your computer for a Word document, Excel 
worksheet, or other type of file to work on, you 
can open it merely by double-clicking its name 
in the Tasks window or Reading pane of the 
Tasks folder. To attach a file to a task:
 ✓ Go to the Insert tab in the Task window and 
click the Attach File button. Then, in the 
Insert File dialog box, select the file and 
click the Insert button.
 ✓ Drag and drop a file to the Task window.

Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
Examining tasks in the Tasks window
Juggling many different tasks is a high art, and to help you get better at it, 
the Tasks window offers these techniques for examining tasks that need 
doing:
 
✦ Choose To-Do List or Tasks in the Navigation pane: Under My Tasks at 
the top of the Navigation pane, choose To-Do List to examine all tasks, 
including those you fashioned from e-mail messages and Calendar 
appointments; choose Tasks to see only the tasks you set for yourself in 
the Tasks folder.
 
✦ Arrange tasks: On the View tab, open the Arrange By gallery and choose 
an option to arrange tasks on the Tasks list by Due Date, Category, 
Importance, or one of the other options.
 
 
✦ Change views: On the Home or View tab, click the Change View button 
and choose a View option. For example, choose Overdue or Next 7 Days 
to focus on the tasks that really need doing.
 
To display tasks on the To-Do bar (refer to Figure 5-1), go to the View tab, 
click the To-Do Bar button, and choose Task List. No matter which folder 
you’re viewing in Outlook, you can double-click a task on the To-Do bar and 
see it in a Task window.
Handling and managing tasks
When the time comes to manage the tasks in the Tasks window, I hope you 
are a stern taskmaster. Here’s advice for handling and managing tasks:
 
✦ Marking a task as complete: Click the check box beside the task name in 
the Tasks window. Outlook draws a line through completed tasks.
 
 
✦ Deleting a task: Select the task and click the Delete button or press the 
Delete key.
 
✦ Editing a task: Double-click a task in the Tasks window to open the Task 
window and change the particulars there.
Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
Outlook offers the Reminder message box to alert you when an appointment 
or event from the Calendar is about to take place (see Chapter 4 of this mini-
book), when a task deadline is looming (see the preceding topic in this chap-
ter), when an e-mail message needs a reply (see Chapter 3 of this mini-book), 
or when someone whose name is in your Contacts folder needs attention 
(see Chapter 2 of this mini-book).

Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
Figure 5-3 shows the Reminder message box. When Outlook is running and 
you least expect it, a Reminder message box similar to the one in the figure 
may appear to keep you on your toes. These pages explain how to handle 
reminder messages, schedule messages, and make the messages appear 
when you want them to appear.
 
Figure 5-3:

Reminder 
message 
box.
 
Handling reminder messages
Select a reminder in the Reminder message box and do the following to 
handle a reminder:
 
✦ Dismiss it: Click the Dismiss button to shelve the reminder notice. If 
more than one notice appears in the Reminder message box and you 
want to erase them all, click the Dismiss All button.
 
✦ Be reminded later: Click the Snooze button. At the bottom of the dialog 
box, the Click Snooze to Be Reminded Again In text box tells you when 
the next reminder message will arrive. To change this setting, open the 
drop-down list and choose a different time period.
 
✦ Open the item: Click the Open Item button to examine the appointment, 
task, e-mail message, or contact to which the reminder pertains.
 
✦ Procrastinate: Click the Close button (the X) in the Reminder message 
box to make it disappear. To open the message box later, go to the View 
tab and click the Reminders Window button.
 
Reminders work only for items that are stored in these folders: Tasks, 
Calendar, Inbox, and Contacts. Store an item in another folder or a subfolder 
of one of the folders I just named, and you won’t see the Reminder message 
box when the reminder is due. To make sure that you get reminded, store 
items in these folders: Tasks, Calendar, Inbox, or Contacts.

Reminders for Being Alerted to Activities and Tasks
Scheduling a reminder message
Follow these instructions to schedule a reminder message:
 
✦ Calendar appointment or event: In the Appointment window, open 
the Reminder drop-down list and choose how many minutes, hours, or 
weeks in advance of the appointment or event to make the reminder 
appear.
 
✦ Task deadline: In the Task window (refer to Figure 5-2), select the 
Reminder check box and choose a day and time to be reminded in the 
drop-down lists.
 
 
✦ E-mail message: In the Message window or Inbox window, click the 
Follow Up button and choose Add Reminder on the drop-down list. You 
see the Custom dialog box. Select the Reminder check box and choose a 
date and time in the drop-down lists. If you enter a date but not a time, 
the Reminder message box appears at 5:00 p.m.
 
✦ Contacts name: In a Contact window or the Contacts window, click the 
Follow Up button and choose Add Reminder on the drop-down list. The 
Custom dialog box opens. Treat this dialog box the same way you treat 
the one for e-mail messages (see the preceding item in this list).
Making reminders work your way
 
 You can do two or three things to make reminders work your way. On the 
File tab, choose Options to open the Options dialog box. Then follow these 
instructions to have your way with reminder notices:
 
✦ Changing the reminder time for appointments and events: By default, 
the Reminder message box appears 15 minutes before appointments and 
events start. To change this setting, go to the Calendar category, and 
enter a new setting in the Default Reminders drop-down list.
 
✦ Changing the default time for task reminders: When a task’s deadline 
arrives, the Reminders dialog box lets you know at 8:00 a.m. (or when 
you start Outlook, if you start the program after 8:00 a.m.). To change 
this default setting, go to the Tasks category and choose a new time 
from the Default Reminder Time drop-down list.
 
✦ Playing a different sound (or no sound): By default, you hear a little 
chime when the Reminder message box appears on-screen. To hear a 
different sound or no sound at all, go to the Advanced category of the 
Options dialog box. To play no sound, deselect the Play Reminder Sound 
check box. To play a different sound, click the Browse button and then 
select a .wav sound file in the Reminder Sound File dialog box.

✦ Creating a note: Click the New Note button (or press Ctrl+N) and type 
the note in the Note window. Then click outside the window. You can 
create a note when you’re not in the Notes window by clicking the New 
Items button and choosing More Items➪Note on the drop-down list (or 
by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N).
 
✦ Opening a note: Double-click a note to read it in its Note window.
 
✦ Forwarding a note: To forward a note to someone in an e-mail message, 
right-click the note and choose Forward. A Message window opens so 
that you can address the message. The note arrives in the form of a file 
attachment, and the recipient must have Outlook in order to read it.
 
 
✦ Deleting a note: Select the note and click the Delete button or press the 
Delete key.

I
t’s impossible to sit through a conference, seminar, or trade show without 
seeing at least one PowerPoint presentation. PowerPoint has found its way 
into nearly every office and boardroom. I’ve heard of a man (a very unroman-
tic man) who proposed to his wife by way of a PowerPoint presentation.
As nice as PowerPoint can be, it has its detractors. If the software isn’t used prop-
erly, it can come between the speaker and the audience. In a New Yorker article 
titled “Absolute PowerPoint: Can a Software Package Edit Our Thoughts?,” Ian 
Parker argued that PowerPoint may actually be more of a hindrance than a help 
in communicating. PowerPoint, Parker wrote, is “a social instrument, turning 
middle managers into bullet-point dandies.” The software, he added, “has a pri-
vate, interior influence. It edits ideas. . . . It helps you make a case, but also makes 
its own case about how to organize information, how to look at the world.”
To make sure that you use PowerPoint wisely, this chapter shows what 
creating a PowerPoint presentation entails. After a brief tour of PowerPoint, 
you find out how to create presentations, get a better view of your work, 
insert slides, put together a photo album, and hide slides.
Getting Acquainted with PowerPoint
Figure 1-1 (top) shows the PowerPoint window. That thing in the middle 
is a slide, the PowerPoint word for an image that you show your audience. 

358
Getting Acquainted with PowerPoint
Surrounding the slide are many tools for entering text and decorating slides. 
When the time comes to show your slides to an audience, you dispense with 
the tools and make the slide fill the screen, as shown in Figure 1-1 (bottom).

A Brief Geography Lesson
To make PowerPoint do your bidding, you need to know a little jargon:
 
✦ Presentation: All the slides, from start to finish, that you show 
your audience. Sometimes presentations are called “slide shows.” 
Presentations are saved in presentation files (.pptx files).
 
✦ Slides: The images you create with PowerPoint. During a presentation, 
slides appear on-screen one after the other. Don’t be put off by the word 
slide and dreary memories of sitting through your uncle’s slide show 
vacation memories. You don’t need a slide projector to show these 
slides. You can now plug a laptop or other computer into special moni-
tors that display PowerPoint slides.
 
✦ Notes: Printed pages that you, the speaker, write and print so that you 
know what to say during a presentation. Only the speaker sees notes. 
Chapter 5 in this mini-book explains notes.
 
✦ Handout: Printed pages that you may give to the audience along with a 
presentation. A handout shows the slides in the presentation. Handouts 
are also known by the somewhat derogatory term leave-behinds. Chapter 
5 of this mini-book explains handouts.
A Brief Geography Lesson
Figure 1-2 shows the different parts of the PowerPoint screen. I’d hate for 
you to get lost in PowerPoint Land. Fold down the corner of this page so that 
you can return here if screen terminology confuses you:
 
 
✦ File tab: The tab you visit to create, open, and save PowerPoint presen-
tations, as well as do other file-management tasks.
 
✦ Quick Access toolbar: A toolbar with three buttons — Save, Undo, and 
Repeat. You see this toolbar wherever you go in PowerPoint.
 
✦ Ribbon: The place where the tabs are located. Click a tab — Home, Insert, 
Design, Transitions, Animations, Slide Show, Review, or View — to start 
a task.
 
✦ Slides pane: In Normal view, the place on the left side of the screen 
where you can see the slides or the text on the slides in your presen-
tation. Scroll in the Slides pane to move backward and forward in a 
presentation.
 
✦ Slide window: Where a slide (in Normal view) or slides (in Slide Sorter 
view) are displayed. Scroll to move backward or forward in your 
presentation.
 
✦ Notes pane: Where you type notes (in Normal view) that you can 
refer to when giving your presentation. The audience can’t see these 
notes — they’re for you and you alone. See Chapter 5 of this mini-book 
for details.

A Whirlwind Tour of PowerPoint
To help you understand what you’re getting into, you’re invited on a whirl-
wind tour of PowerPoint. Creating a PowerPoint presentation entails com-
pleting these basic tasks:
 
✦ Creating the slides: After you create a new presentation, your next task 
is to create the slides. PowerPoint offers many preformatted slide lay-
outs, each designed for presenting information a certain way.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Getting Started 
in PowerPoint
361
Creating a New Presentation
 
✦ Notes: As you create slides, you can jot down notes in the Notes pane. 
You can use these notes later to formulate your presentation and decide 
what you’re going to say to your audience while each slide is on-screen 
(see Chapter 5 of this mini-book).
 
✦ Designing your presentation: After you create a presentation, the next 
step is to think about its appearance. You can change slides’ colors 
and backgrounds, as well as choose a theme for your presentation, an 
all-encompassing design that applies to all (or most of) the slides (see 
Chapter 2 of this mini-book).
 
✦ Inserting tables, charts, diagrams, and shapes: A PowerPoint presenta-
tion should be more than a loose collection of bulleted lists. Starting on 
the Insert tab, you can place tables, charts, and diagrams on slides, as 
well as adorn your slides with text boxes, WordArt images, and shapes 
(see Chapter 4 of this mini-book).
 
✦ “Animating” your slides: PowerPoint slides can play video and sound, 
as well as be “animated” (see Chapter 4 of this mini-book). You can make 
the items on a slide move on the screen. As a slide arrives, you can make 
it spin or flash.
 
✦ Delivering your presentation: During a presentation, you can draw on 
the slides. You can also blank the screen and show slides out of order. In 
case you can’t be there in person, PowerPoint gives you the opportunity 
to create self-running presentations and presentations that others can 
run on their own. You can also distribute presentations on CDs and as 
videos (see Chapter 5 of this mini-book).
Creating a New Presentation
When you start PowerPoint, the program creates a new, blank presentation 
just for you. You can make this bare-bones presentation the starting point 
for constructing your presentation, or you can get a more sophisticated, 
fully realized layout and design by starting with a template. Templates are a 
mixed blessing. They’re designed by artists and they look very good. Some 
templates come with boilerplate text — already written material that you 
can recycle into your presentation. However, presentations made from tem-
plates are harder to modify. Sometimes the design gets in the way. As well, a 
loud or intricate background may overwhelm a diagram or chart you want to 
put on a slide.
 
 No matter what kind of presentation you want to create, start creating it by 
going to the File tab and choosing New. You see the Available Templates and 
Themes window shown in Figure 1-3. This window offers templates for creat-
ing many types of presentations. Click a template to preview it on the right 
side of the window. Double-click a template (or select it and click the Create 
button) to create a presentation. Use one of these techniques to create a 
presentation:

362
Creating a New Presentation
 
✦ Blank presentation: Double-click the Blank Presentation icon. A new 
presentation appears. Try visiting the Design tab and choosing a theme 
or background style to get a taste of all the things you can do to decorate 
a presentation. (By pressing Ctrl+N, you can create a new, blank presenta-
tion without opening the Available Templates and Themes window.)
 
Figure 1-3: 
The

and Themes 
window is

a presen-
tation.
 
 
✦ Recently used template: Click the Recent Templates icon to use a tem-
plate listed there.
 
✦ Template on your computer: Click the Sample Templates icon. Templates 
that you loaded on your computer when you installed PowerPoint appear.
 
✦ Template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft): Click 
the My Templates icon. The New Presentation dialog box appears. Select 
a template and click OK.
 
✦ Template available online at Office.com: Enter a search term in the 
Search box, make sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, 
and click the Start Searching button. Templates appear in the window. 
Double-click a template to download and use it to create a presentation.
 
✦ Recycle another presentation: If you can use another presentation as the 
starting point for creating a new presentation, nab slides from the other 
presentation. Click the New from Existing icon. In the New from Existing 
Presentation dialog box, select the presentation and click the Open button.
 
You can click the Home, Back, or Forward button in the Available Templates 
and Themes window to backtrack as you search for a template.

Advice for Building Persuasive Presentations
 
If you intend to create a presentation from photos you took of a vacation or 
family reunion, consider creating a photo album. See “Putting Together a 
Photo Album” later in this chapter.
Advice for Building Persuasive Presentations
 
Before you create any slides, think about what you want to communicate to 
your audience. Your goal isn’t to dazzle the audience with your PowerPoint 
skills, but communicate something — a company policy, the merits of a 
product, the virtues of a strategic plan. Your goal is to bring the audience 
around to your side. To that end, here is some practical advice for building 
persuasive presentations:
 
✦ Start by writing the text in Word. Start in Microsoft Word, not 
PowerPoint, so that you can focus on the words. In Word, you can 
clearly see how a presentation develops. You can make sure that your 
presentation builds to its rightful conclusion. PowerPoint has a special 
command for getting headings from a Word file. (See “Conjuring slides 
from Word document headings,” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ When choosing a design, consider the audience. A presentation to the 
American Casketmakers Association calls for a mute, quiet design; a pre-
sentation to the Cheerleaders of Tomorrow calls for something bright 
and splashy. Select a slide design that sets the tone for your presenta-
tion and wins the sympathy of the audience.
 
✦ Keep it simple. To make sure that PowerPoint doesn’t upstage you, keep 
it simple. Make use of the PowerPoint features, but do so judiciously. An 
animation in the right place at the right time can serve a valuable pur-
pose. It can highlight an important part of a presentation and grab the 
audience’s attention. But stuffing a presentation with too many gizmos 
turns a presentation into a carnival sideshow and distracts from your 
message.
 
✦ Follow the one-slide-per-minute rule. At the very minimum, a slide 
should stay on-screen for at least one minute. If you have 15 minutes 
to speak, you’re allotted no more than 15 slides for your presentation, 
according to the rule.
 
✦ Beware the bullet point. Terse bullet points have their place in a pre-
sentation, but if you put them there strictly to remind yourself what to 
say next, you’re doing your audience a disfavor. Bullet points can cause 
drowsiness. They can be a distraction. The audience skims the bullets 
when it should be attending to your voice and the argument you’re 
making. When you’re tempted to use a bulleted list, consider using a 
table, chart, or diagram instead. Figure 1-4 demonstrates how a bulleted 
list can be presented instead in a table, chart, or diagram.

364
Advice for Building Persuasive Presentations
 
Figure 1-4: 
List 
information 
presented 
in a table 
(top), chart 
(middle), 
and diagram 
(bottom).
 
 
✦ Take control from the start. Spend the first minute introducing your-
self to the audience without running PowerPoint (or, if you do run 
PowerPoint, put a simple slide with your company name or logo on-
screen). Make eye contact with the audience. This way, you establish 
your credibility. You give the audience a chance to get to know you.
 
✦ Make clear what you’re about. In the early going, state very clearly 
what your presentation is about and what you intend to prove with your 
presentation. In other words, state the conclusion at the beginning as 
well as the end. This way, your audience knows exactly what you’re driv-
ing at and can judge your presentation according to how well you build 
your case.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Getting Started 
in PowerPoint
365
Creating New Slides for Your Presentation
 
✦ Personalize the presentation. Make the presentation a personal one. Tell 
the audience what your personal reason for being there is or why you 
work for the company you work for. Knowing that you have a personal 
stake in the presentation, the audience is more likely to trust you. The 
audience understands that you’re not a spokesperson, but a speaker — 
someone who has come before them to make a case for something that 
you believe in.
 
✦ Tell a story. Include an anecdote in the presentation. Everybody loves a 
pertinent and well-delivered story. This piece of advice is akin to the previ-
ous one about personalizing your presentation. Typically, a story illustrates 
a problem for people and how people solve the problem. Even if your 
presentation concerns technology or an abstract subject, make it about 
people. “The people in Shaker Heights needed faster Internet access,” not 
“the data switches in Shaker Heights just weren’t performing fast enough.”
 
✦ Rehearse and then rehearse some more. The better you know your 
material, the less nervous you will be. To keep from getting nervous, 
rehearse your presentation until you know it backward and forward. 
Rehearse it out loud. Rehearse it while imagining you’re in the presence 
of an audience.
 
✦ Use visuals, not only words, to make your point. You really owe it to 
your audience to take advantage of the table, chart, diagram, and picture 
capabilities of PowerPoint. People understand more from words and pic-
tures than they do from words alone. It’s up to you — not the slides — 
as the speaker to describe topics in detail with words.
Want to see just how PowerPoint can suck the life and drama out of a dra-
matic presentation? Try visiting the Gettysburg PowerPoint Presentation, 
a rendering of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address in PowerPoint. Yikes! You can 
find it here: http://.norvig.com/Gettysburg.
Creating New Slides for Your Presentation
After you create a presentation, your next step on the path to glory is to 
start adding the slides. To create a new slide, you start by choosing a slide 
layout. Slide layouts are the preformatted slide designs that help you enter 
text, graphics, and other things. Some slide layouts have text placeholder 
frames for entering titles and text; some come with content placeholder 
frames designed especially for inserting a table, chart, diagram, picture, 
clip-art image, or media clip.
When you add a slide, select the slide layout that best approximates the 
slide you have in mind for your presentation. Figure 1-5 shows the slide 
layouts that are available when you create a presentation with the Blank 
Presentation template. These pages explain how to insert slides and harvest 
them from Word document headings.

Inserting a new slide
Follow these steps to insert a new slide in your presentation:
 
1. Select the slide that you want the new slide to go after.
 
 In Normal view, select the slide on the Slides pane. In Slide Sorter view, 
select the slide in the main window.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the bottom half of the New Slide button.
 
 You see a drop-down list of slide layouts. (If you click the top half of 
the New Slide button, you insert a slide with the same layout as the one 
you selected in Step 1.) Figure 1-5 shows what the slide layouts look like 
(left), what a slide looks like right after you insert it (middle), and fin-
ished slides (right).
 
3. Select the slide layout that best approximates the slide you want to 
create.
 
 Don’t worry too much about selecting the right layout. You can change 
slide layouts later on, as “Selecting a different layout for a slide” explains 
later in this chapter.

Speed techniques for inserting slides
 
When you’re in a hurry, use these techniques to insert a slide:
 
✦ Creating a duplicate slide: Select the slide or slides you want to dupli-
cate, and on the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the New Slide 
button and choose Duplicate Selected Slides. You can also open the 
drop-down list on the Copy button and choose Duplicate.
 
✦ Copying and pasting slides: Click the slide you want to copy (or Ctrl+click 
to select more than one slide) and then click the Copy button on the Home 
tab (or press Ctrl+C). Next, click to select the slide that you want the copied 
slide (or slides) to appear after and click the Paste button (or press Ctrl+V).
 
✦ Recycling slides from other presentations: Select the slide that you 
want the recycled slides to follow in your presentation, and on the Home 
tab, open the drop-down list on the New Slide button and choose Reuse 
Slides. The Reuse Slides task pane opens. Open the drop-down list on 
the Browse button, choose Browse File, and select a presentation in 
the Browse dialog box. The Reuse Slides task pane shows thumbnail 
versions of slides in the presentation you selected. One at a time, click 
slides to add them to your presentation. You can right-click a slide and 
choose Insert All Slides to grab all the slides in the presentation.
Conjuring slides from Word document headings
If you think about it, Word headings are similar to slide titles. Headings, like 
slide titles, introduce a new topic. If you know your way around Word and you 
want to get a head start creating a PowerPoint presentation, you can borrow the 
headings in a Word document for your PowerPoint slides. After you import the 
headings from Word, you get one slide for each Level 1 heading (headings given 
the Heading 1 style). Level 1 headings form the title of the slides, Level 2 head-
ings form first-level bullets, Level 3 headings form second-level bullets, and so 
on. Paragraph text isn’t imported. Figure 1-6 shows what headings from a Word 
document look like after they land in a PowerPoint presentation.
Follow these steps to use headings in a Word document to create slides in a 
PowerPoint presentation:
 
 1. In Normal view, click the Outline tab in the Slides pane.
 
 The Outline tab displays slide text (see Figure 1-6). You get a better 
sense of how headings from the Word document land in your presenta-
tion by viewing your presentation from the Outline tab.
 
2. Select the slide that the new slides from the Word document will 
follow.

 3. On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the New Slide button 
and choose Slides from Outline.
 
 You see the Insert Outline dialog box.
 
4. Select the Word document with the headings you want for your pre-
sentation and click the Insert button.
 
 Depending on how many first-level headings are in the Word docu-
ment, you get a certain number of new slides. These slides probably 
need work. The Word text may need tweaking to make it suitable for a 
PowerPoint presentation.
Selecting a different layout for a slide
If you mistakenly choose the wrong layout for a slide, all is not lost. You can 
start all over. You can graft a new layout onto your slide with one of these 
techniques:
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Layout button and choose a layout on the 
drop-down list.
 
✦ Right-click the slide (being careful not to right-click a frame or object), 
choose Layout, and choose a layout on the submenu.
 
PowerPoint also offers the Reset command for giving a slide its original layout 
after you’ve fiddled with it. If you push a slide all out of shape and you regret 
doing so, select your slide, go to the Home tab, and click the Reset button.

Getting a Better View of Your Work
Getting a Better View of Your Work
Depending on the task at hand, some views are better than others. These 
pages explain how to change views and the relative merits of Normal, Slide 
Sorter, Notes Page, Slide Show, Slide Master, Reading View, Handout Master, 
and Notes Master view.
Changing views
PowerPoint offers two places to change views:
 
✦ View buttons on the status bar: Click a View button — Normal, Slide 
Sorter, Slide Show, or Reading View — on the status bar to change 
views, as shown in Figure 1-7.
 
✦ View tab: On the View tab, click a button on the Presentation Views or 
Master Views group, as shown in Figure 1-7.

Looking at the different views
Here is a survey of the different views with suggestions about using each one:

Book IV
Chapter 1
Getting Started 
in PowerPoint
371
Getting a Better View of Your Work
 
 ✦ Normal/Slides view for examining slides: Switch to Normal view, move 
the pointer to the Slides pane, and select the Slides tab when you want 
to examine a slide. In this view, thumbnail slides appear in the Slides 
pane, and you can see your slide in all its glory in the middle of the 
screen.
 
 ✦ Normal/Outline view for fiddling with text: Switch to Normal view, 
move the pointer to the Slides pane, and select the Outline tab to enter 
or read text (refer to Figure 1-6). You can find the Outline tab at the top 
of the Slides pane. The words appear in outline form. Normal/Outline 
view is ideal for focusing on the words in a presentation.
 
 
✦ Slide Sorter view for moving and deleting slides: In Slide Sorter view, 
you see thumbnails of all the slides in the presentation (use the Zoom 
Slider to change the size of thumbnails). From here, moving slides 
around is easy, and seeing many slides simultaneously gives you a sense 
of whether the different slides are consistent with one another and how 
the whole presentation is shaping up. The slides are numbered so that 
you can see where they appear in a presentation.
 
 
✦ Notes Page view for reading your speaker notes: In Notes Page view, 
you see notes you’ve written to aid you in your presentation, if you’ve 
written any. You can write notes in this view as well as in the Notes pane 
in Normal view. Chapter 5 of this mini-book explains notes pages.
 
 
✦ Reading View view for focusing on slides’ appearance: In Reading View 
view, you also see a single slide, but it appears on-screen with the View 
buttons and with buttons for moving quickly from slide to slide. Switch 
to Reading View view to proofread slides and put the final touches on a 
presentation.
 
 
✦ Slide Show view for giving a presentation: In Slide Show view, you 
see a single slide. Not only that, but the slide fills the entire screen. 
This is what your presentation looks like when you show it to an 
audience.
 
✦ The Master views for a consistent presentation: The master views — 
Slide Master, Handout Master, and Notes Master — are for handling 
master styles, the formatting commands that pertain to all the slides in a 
presentation, handouts, and notes. To switch to these views, go to the 
View tab and click the appropriate button. Chapter 2 of this mini-book 
looks into master slides and master styles.
 
 PowerPoint offers a button called Fit Slide to Current Window that you can 
click while you’re in Normal view to make the slide fill the window. This little 
button is located in the lower-right corner of the screen, to the right of the 
Zoom controls.

372
Hiding and Displaying the Slides Pane and Notes Pane
Hiding and Displaying the Slides 
Pane and Notes Pane
In Normal view, the Slides pane with its slide thumbnails appears on the left 
side of the screen, and the Notes pane appears on the bottom of the screen 
so that you can scribble notes about slides. Sometimes these panes just take 
up valuable space. They clutter the screen and occupy real estate that could 
be better used for formatting slides. Follow these instructions to temporarily 
close the Slides and Notes pane:
 
✦ Closing the Notes pane: Move the pointer over the border between the 
pane and the rest of the screen, and after the pointer changes to a two-
headed arrow, drag the border to the bottom of the screen.
 
✦ Closing the Slides pane (and the Notes pane): Click the Close button 
on the Slides pane. This button is located to the right of the Outline tab. 
Clicking it closes the Notes pane as well as the Slides pane.
 
 
✦ Restoring the Slides and Notes pane: Click the Normal button (on the 
status bar or View tab). You can also move the pointer to the left side or 
bottom of the screen and, when you see the double-headed arrow, click 
and start dragging toward the center of the screen.
 
You can change the size of either pane by moving the pointer over its border 
and then clicking and dragging.
Selecting, Moving, and Deleting Slides
As a presentation takes shape, you have to move slides forward and back-
ward. Sometimes you have to delete a slide. And you can’t move or delete 
slides until you select them first. Herewith are instructions for selecting, 
moving, and deleting slides.
Selecting slides
The best place to select slides is Slide Sorter view (if you want to select sev-
eral at a time). Use one of these techniques to select slides:
 
✦ Select one slide: Click the slide.
 
✦ Select several different slides: Hold down the Ctrl key and click each 
slide in the Slides pane or in Slide Sorter view.
 
✦ Select several slides in succession: Hold down the Shift key and click 
the first slide and then the last one.

Putting Together a Photo Album
 
✦ Select a block of slides: In Slide Sorter view, drag across the slides you 
want to select. Be sure when you click and start dragging that you don’t 
click a slide.
 
 
✦ Select all the slides: On the Home tab, click the Select button and 
choose Select All on the drop-down list.
Moving slides
To move or rearrange slides, you’re advised to go to Slide Sorter view. Select 
the slide or slides that you want to move and use one of these techniques to 
move slides:
 
✦ Dragging and dropping: Click the slides you selected and drag them to 
a new location. You see the drag pointer, and in Slide Sorter view, a ver-
tical line shows you where the slide or slides will land when you release 
the mouse button. On the Slides pane, a horizontal line appears between 
slides to show you where the slide or slides will land when you release 
the mouse button.
 
✦ Cutting and pasting: On the Home tab, cut the slide or slides to the 
Windows Clipboard (click the Cut button, press Ctrl+X, or right-click and 
choose Cut). Then select the slide that you want the slide or slides to 
appear after and give the Paste command (click the Paste button, press 
Ctrl+V, or right-click and choose Paste). You can right-click between 
slides to paste with precision.
Deleting slides
Before you delete a slide, think twice about deleting. Short of using the Undo 
command, you can’t resuscitate a deleted slide. Select the slide or slides you 
want to delete and use one of these techniques to delete slides:
 
✦ Press the Delete key.
 
✦ Right-click and choose Delete Slide on the shortcut menu.
Putting Together a Photo Album
Photo album is just PowerPoint’s term for inserting many photographs into a 
presentation all at once. You don’t necessarily have to stuff the photo album 
with travel or baby pictures for it to be a proper photo album. The Photo 
Album is a wonderful feature because you can use it to dump a bunch of 
photos in a PowerPoint presentation without having to create slides one at a 
time, insert the photos, and endure the rest of the rigmarole. Create a photo 
album to quickly place a bunch of photos on PowerPoint slides.

374
Putting Together a Photo Album
Creating your photo album
 
 PowerPoint creates a new presentation for you when you create a photo 
album. To start, take note of where on your computer the photos you want 
for the album are. Then go to the Insert tab and click the Photo Album 
button. You see the Photo Album dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-8. For 
such a little thing, the Photo Album dialog box offers many opportunities 
for constructing a PowerPoint presentation. Your first task is to decide 
which pictures you want for your album. Then you choose a slide layout for 
the pictures.

Inserting pictures and creating slides
Here is the lowdown on choosing pictures for a photo album:
 
✦ Inserting photos: Click the File/Disk button and choose photos in the 
Insert New Pictures dialog box. You can select more than one photo at 
a time by Ctrl+clicking. The filenames of photos you selected appear 
in the Pictures in Album box. Slide numbers appear as well so that you 
know which photos are on which slides.
 
✦ Deciding how photos are framed: Open the Frame Shape drop-down 
list and choose an option for placing borders or rounded corners on 
your photos. (This option isn’t available if you choose Fit to Slide on the 
Picture Layout drop-down list.)

Book IV
Chapter 1

Putting Together a Photo Album
 
✦ Inserting a text box: Insert a text box if you want to enter commentary 
in your photo album. In the Pictures in Album box, select the picture or 
text box that you want your new text box to go after and then click the 
New Text Box button. Later, you can go into your presentation and edit 
the placeholder text, which PowerPoint aptly enters as Text Box.
 
✦ Providing captions for all pictures: To place a caption below all the pic-
tures in your photo album, select the Captions Below ALL Pictures check 
box. PowerPoint initially places the picture filename in the caption, but 
you can delete this caption and enter one of your own. (To select this 
option, you must choose a picture layout option besides Fit to Slide.)
 
✦ Changing the order of pictures: Select a picture in the Pictures in 
Album box and then click an arrow button to move it forward or back-
ward in the presentation.
 
✦ Changing the order of slides: Ctrl+click to select each picture on a slide. 
Then click an arrow as many times as necessary to move the slide for-
ward or backward in the presentation.
 
✦ Removing a picture: Select a picture in the Pictures in Album box and 
click the Remove button to remove it from your photo album. You can 
Ctrl+click pictures to select more than one.
Choosing a layout for slides
Your next task is to go to the bottom of the Photo Album dialog box (refer to 
Figure 1-8) and choose a layout for the slides in the presentation. Open the 
Picture Layout drop-down list to choose one of the seven picture layouts:
 
✦ Choose Fit to Slide for a presentation in which each picture occupies an 
entire slide.
 
✦ Choose a “pictures” option to fit 1, 2, or 4 pictures on each slide.
 
✦ Choose a “pictures with” option to fit 1, 2, or 4 pictures as well as a text 
title frame on each slide.
Changing the look of pictures
The Photo Album dialog box (refer to Figure 1-8) offers a handful of tools for 
changing the look of the pictures. When you use these tools, keep your eye 
on the Preview box — it shows you what you’re doing to your picture.
 
✦ Making all photos black and white: Select the ALL Pictures Black and 
White check box.
 
✦ Rotating pictures: Click a Rotate button to rotate a picture clockwise or 
counterclockwise.

376
Putting Together a Photo Album
 
✦ Changing the contrast: Click a Contrast button to sharpen or mute the 
light and dark colors or shades in the picture.
 
✦ Changing the brightness: Click a Brightness button to make a picture 
brighter or more somber.
 
✦ Choosing a frame shape for pictures: If you opted for a “picture” or 
“picture with” slide layout, you can choose a shape — Beveled, Oval, or 
others — for your pictures on the Frame Shape drop-down list.
 
✦ Choosing a theme for your photo album: If you selected a “picture” or 
“picture with” slide layout, you can choose a theme for your slide pre-
sentation. Click the Browse button and choose a theme in the Choose 
Theme dialog box.
At last, click the Create button when you’re ready to create the photo album. 
PowerPoint attaches a title slide to the start of the album that says, Photo 
Album with your name below.
Putting on the final touches
Depending on the options you chose for your photo album, it needs all or 
some of these final touches:
 
✦ Fix the title slide: Your title slide should probably say more than the 
words Photo Album and your name.
 
✦ Fill in the text boxes: If you asked for text boxes with your photo album, 
by all means, replace PowerPoint’s generic text with meaningful words 
of your own.
 
✦ Write the captions: If you asked for photo captions, PowerPoint entered 
photo filenames below photos. Replace those filenames with something 
more descriptive.
Editing a photo album
 
 To go back into the Photo Album dialog box and rearrange the photos in 
your album, go to the Insert tab, open the drop-down list on the Photo 
Album button, and choose Edit Photo Album on the drop-down list. You see 
the Edit Photo Album dialog box. It looks and works exactly like the Photo 
Album dialog box (refer to Figure 1-8). Of course, you can also edit your 
photo album by treating it like any other PowerPoint presentation. Change 
the theme, fiddle with the slides, and do what you will to torture your photo 
album into shape.

Hidden Slides for All Contingencies
Hidden Slides for All Contingencies
Hide a slide when you want to keep it on hand “just in case” during a pre-
sentation. Hidden slides don’t appear in slide shows unless you shout Ollie 
ollie oxen free! and bring them out of hiding. Although you, the presenter, 
can see hidden slides in Normal view and Slide Sorter view, where their slide 
numbers are crossed through, the audience doesn’t see them in the course 
of a presentation unless you decide to show them. Create hidden slides if 
you anticipate having to steer your presentation in a different direction — to 
answer a question from the audience, prove your point more thoroughly, or 
revisit a topic in more depth. Merely by right-clicking and choosing a couple 
of commands, you can display a hidden slide in the course of a slide show.
Hiding a slide
 
The best place to put hidden slides is the end of a presentation where you 
know you can find them. Follow these steps to hide slides:
 
1. Select the slide or slides that you want to hide.
 
 2. On the Slide Show tab, click the Hide Slide button.
 
 You can also right-click a slide in the Slides pane or Slide Sorter view 
and choose Hide Slide. Hidden slides’ numbers are boxed and crossed 
through in the Slides pane and the Slide Sorter window.
To unhide a slide, click the Hide Slide button again or right-click the slide 
and choose Hide Slide.
Showing a hidden slide during a presentation
Hidden slides don’t appear during the course of a presentation, but suppose that 
the need arises to show one. Before showing a hidden slide, take careful note of 
which slide you’re viewing now. You have to return to this slide after viewing the 
hidden slide. Follow these steps to view a hidden slide during a presentation:
 
1. Right-click the screen and choose Go to Slide.
 
 You see a submenu with the titles of slides in your presentation. 
 
2. Select a hidden slide so that the audience can view it.
 
 You can tell which slides are hidden because their slide numbers are 
enclosed in parentheses.

378
Hidden Slides for All Contingencies
How do you resume your presentation after viewing a hidden slide? If you 
look at only one hidden slide, you can right-click and choose Last Viewed 
on the shortcut menu to return to the slide you saw before the hidden slide. 
If you’ve viewed several hidden slides, right-click the screen, choose Go to 
Slide, and select a slide to pick up where you left off.

Chapter 2: Fashioning a Look 
for Your Presentation
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing themes and background styles
✓ Selecting and tweaking slide themes
✓ Creating a solid color, gradient, clip-art, picture, and texture slide 
background
✓ Selecting a theme or background for specific slides
✓ Redesigning your presentation with master slides
F
rom the audience’s point of view, this chapter is the most important in 
this mini-book. What your presentation looks like — which theme and 
background style you select for the slides in your presentation — sets the 
tone. From the very first slide, the audience judges your presentation on 
its appearance. When you create a look for your presentation, what you’re 
really doing is declaring what you want to communicate to your audience.
This chapter explains how to handle slide backgrounds. It examines what 
you need to consider when you select colors and designs for backgrounds. 
You also discover how to select and customize a theme, and how to create 
your own slide backgrounds. This chapter looks into how to change the 
background of some but not all of the slides in a presentation. It also 
explains how to use master slides and master styles to make sure that slides 
throughout your presentation are consistent with one another.
Looking at Themes and Background Styles
What a presentation looks like is mostly a matter of slide backgrounds, and 
when you select a background for slides, you start by selecting a theme. A 
theme is a “canned” slide design. Themes are designed by graphic artists. 
Most themes include sophisticated background patterns and colors. For 
each theme, PowerPoint offers several alternative theme colors, fonts, and 
background styles. As well, you can create a background of your own from a 
single color, a gradient mixture of two colors, or a picture.

380
Looking at Themes and Background Styles
Figure 2-1 shows examples of themes. Themes range from the fairly simple 
to the quite complex. When you installed PowerPoint on your computer, you 
also installed a dozen or more themes, and you can acquire more themes 
online from Office.com and other places. After you select a theme for your 
presentation, you can tweak it a little bit. You can do that by choosing a back-
ground style or by creating an entirely new background of your own.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Examples of 
themes.
 
Figure 2-2 shows examples of backgrounds you can create yourself. Self-
made backgrounds are not as intrusive as themes. The risk of the back-
ground overwhelming the lists, tables, charts, and other items in the 
forefront of slides is less when you fashion a background style yourself.

Choosing a Theme for Your Presentation
 
More than any other design decision, what sets the tone for a presenta-
tion are the colors you select for slide backgrounds. If the purpose of your 
presentation is to show photographs you took on a vacation to Arizona’s 
Painted Desert, select light-tone, hot colors for the slide backgrounds. If 
your presentation is an aggressive sales pitch, consider a black background. 
There is no universal color theory for selecting the right colors in a design 
because everyone is different. Follow your intuition. It will guide you to the 
right background color choices.
Choosing a Theme for Your Presentation
After you initially select a theme, you can do one or two things to customize 
it. These pages explain how to find and select a theme for your presenta-
tion and diddle with a theme after you select it. By the way, the name of the 
theme that is currently in use is listed on the left side of the status bar, in 
case you’re curious about a theme you want to replace.
Selecting a theme
Use one of these techniques to select a new theme for your presentation:
 
✦ Selecting a theme in the Themes gallery: On the Design tab, open the 
Themes gallery and move the pointer over different themes to ”live-
preview” them. Click a theme to select it.
 
✦ Borrowing a theme from another presentation: On the Design tab, 
open the Themes gallery, and click Browse for Themes. You see the 
Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box. Locate and select a 
presentation with a theme you can commandeer for your presentation 
and click the Apply button.
Tweaking a theme
Starting on the Design tab, you can customize a theme with these techniques 
and in so doing alter all the slides in your presentation:
 
 
✦ Choosing a new set of colors: The easiest and best way to experiment 
with customizing a theme is to select a different color set. Click the 
Colors button, slide the pointer over the different color sets on the drop-
down list, and see what effect they have on your slides.
 
 
✦ Change the fonts: Click the Fonts button and choose a font combination 
on the drop-down list. The first font in each pair applies to slide titles 
and the second to slide text. You can also choose Create New Theme 
Fonts on the list and select theme fonts of your own.

382
Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own
 
 
✦ Change theme effects: Click the Effects button and choose a theme 
effect on the drop-down list. A theme effect is a slight refinement to a 
theme.
 
 ✦ Choosing background style variation: Most themes offer background 
style variations. Click the Background Styles button to open the 
Background Styles gallery and select a style. The next topic in this chap-
ter, “Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own,” explains how you can 
create backgrounds similar to these, as well as how to create a single-
color, gradient, clip-art, picture, and texture background.
 
Suppose you regret customizing a theme. To get the original theme back, 
select it again. Make like you were selecting a theme for the first time and 
select it in the Themes gallery.
Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own
Besides a theme or background style, your other option for creating slide 
backgrounds is to do it on your own. For a background, you can have a solid 
color, a transparent color, a gradient blend of colors, a picture, or a clip-art 
image.
 
✦ Solid color: A single, uniform color. You can adjust a color’s transpar-
ency and in effect “bleach out” the color to push it farther into the 
background.
 
✦ Gradient: A mixture of different colors with the colors blending into 
one another.
 
✦ Clip art: A clip-art image from the Microsoft Clip Organizer.
 
✦ Picture: A photograph or graphic.
 
✦ Texture: A uniform pattern that gives the impression that the slide is 
displayed on a material such as cloth or stone.
How to create these kinds of slide backgrounds on your own is the subject of 
the next several pages.
Using a solid (or transparent) 
color for the slide background
Using a solid or transparent color for the background gives your slides a 
straightforward, honest look. Because all the slides are the same color or 
transparent color, the audience can focus better on the presentation itself 

Book IV
Chapter 2
Fashioning a 
Look for Your 
Presentation

Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own
rather than the razzle-dazzle. Follow these steps to use a solid or transpar-
ent color as the background for slides:
 
 1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose 
Format Background on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Fill category of the Format Background dialog box.
 
2. Select the Solid Fill option button.
 
3. Click the Color button and choose a color on the drop-down list.
 
 The muted theme colors are recommended because they look better in 
the background, but you can select a standard color or click the More 
Colors button and select a color in the Colors dialog box.
 
4. Drag the Transparency slider if you want a “bleached out” color 
rather than a slide color.
 
 At 0% transparency, you get a solid color; at 100%, you get no color at all.
 
5. Click the Apply to All button and then the Close button.
 
 I sincerely hope you like your choice of colors, but if you don’t, try, try, 
try again.
Creating a gradient color blend 
for slide backgrounds
Gradient refers to how and where two or more colors grade, or blend, into 
one another on a slide. As well as the standard linear gradient direction, you 
can opt for a radial, rectangular, or path gradient direction. Figure 2-3 shows 
examples of gradient fill backgrounds. These backgrounds look terribly ele-
gant. Using a gradient is an excellent way to create an original background 
that looks different from all the other presenter’s slide backgrounds.
Follow these steps to create a gradient background for slides:
 1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button, and choose 
Format Background on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Fill category of the Format Background dialog box. Drag this 
dialog box to the left side of the screen so that you can get a better view 
of your slide.
 
2. Click the Gradient Fill option button.
 
 Before you experiment with gradients, try opening the Preset Colors 
drop-down list to see whether one of the ready-made gradient options 
does the job for you.

Examples 
of gradient 
fill slide 
backgrounds 
(clockwise

tangular, 
and path.
 
 
3. On the Type drop-down list, choose what type of gradient you want — 
Linear, Radial, Rectangular, Path, or Shade from Title (see Figure 2-3).
 
 If you choose Linear, you can enter a degree measurement in the Angle 
box to change the angle at which the colors blend. At 90 degrees, for 
example, colors blend horizontally across the slide; at 180 degrees, they 
blend vertically.
 
4. Create a gradient stop for each color transition you want on your 
slides.
 
 Gradient stops determine where colors are, how colors transition from 
one to the next, and which colors are used. You can create as many gradi-
ent stops as you want. Here are techniques for handling gradient stops:
 
• Adding a gradient stop: Click the Add Gradient Stop button. A new 
gradient stop appears on the slider. Drag it to where you want the 
color blend to occur.
 
• Removing a gradient stop: Select a gradient stop on the slider and 
click the Remove Gradient Stop button.
 
• Choosing a color for a gradient stop: Select a gradient stop on the 
slider, click the Color button, and choose a color on the drop-down 
list.
 
• Positioning a gradient stop: Drag a gradient stop on the slider or use 
the Position box to move it to a different location.
 
5. Drag the Brightness slider to make the colors dimmer or brighter.

6. Drag the Transparency slider to make the colors on the slides more or 
less transparent.
 
 At 0% transparency, you get solid colors; at 100%, you get no color at all.
 
7. Click the Apply to All button.
 
 Very likely, you have to experiment with stop colors and stop positions 
until you blend the colors to your satisfaction. Good luck.
Placing a clip-art image in the slide background
As long as they’re on the pale side or you’ve made them semitransparent, 
clip-art images do fine for slide backgrounds. They look especially good in 
title slides. Figure 2-4 shows examples of clip-art images as backgrounds. 
As Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains, PowerPoint comes with numerous clip-art 
images. You’re invited to place one in the background of your slides by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
 1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose 
Format Background on the drop-down list.
 
 The Fill category of the Format Background dialog box appears.
 
Figure 2-4: 
For back-

has to be 
at least 
somewhat 
transparent. 
These 
slides are 
(from left to 
right) 0%, 
40%, 65%, 
and 85% 
transparent.

2. Click the Picture or Texture Fill option button.
 
3. Click the Clip Art button.
 
 You see the Select Picture dialog box.
 
4. Find and select a clip-art image that you can use in the background of 
your slides.
 
 You can scroll through the clip-art images until you find a good one, 
enter a search term in the Search Text box and click the Go button (click 
the Include Content from Office Online check box to search online at 
Microsoft for a clip-art image), or click the Import button to get an image 
from your computer.
 
5. In the Format Background dialog box, enter a Transparency 
measurement.
 
 Drag the Transparency slider or enter a measurement in the box. The 
higher the measurement, the more transparent the image is (see 
Figure 2-4).
 
6. Enter measurements in the Offsets boxes to make your clip-art image 
fill the slide.
 
7. Click the Apply to All button and then click Close.
 
 There you have it. The clip-art image you selected lands in the slides’ 
backgrounds.
Using a picture for a slide background
Figure 2-5 shows examples of pictures being used as slide backgrounds. 
Select your picture carefully. A picture with too many colors — and that 
includes the majority of color photographs — obscures the text and makes 
it difficult to read. You can get around this problem by “recoloring” a picture 
to give it a uniform color tint, selecting a grayscale photograph, selecting a 
photo with colors of a similar hue, or making the picture semi-transparent, 
but all in all, the best way to solve the problem of a picture that obscures 
the text is to start with a quiet, subdued picture. (Book VIII, Chapter 3 
explains all the ins and outs of using pictures in Office 2010.)
 
One more thing: Select a landscape-style picture that is wider than it is tall. 
PowerPoint expands pictures to make them fill the entire slide background. 
If you select a skinny, portrait-style picture, PowerPoint has to do a lot of 
expanding to make it fit on the slide, and you end up with a distorted back-
ground image.

 How do you like your slide background? You may have to open the 
Format Background dialog box again and play with the transparency 
setting. Only the very lucky and the permanently blessed get it right 
the first time.
Using a texture for a slide background
Yet another option for slide backgrounds is to use a texture. As shown in 
Figure 2-6, a texture gives the impression that the slide is displayed on a 
material such as marble or parchment. A texture can make for a very elegant 
slide background. Follow these steps to use a texture as a slide background:
 
 1. On the Design tab, click the Background Styles button and choose 
Format Background on the drop-down list.

Changing the Background of 
a Single or Handful of Slides
To make a single slide (or a handful of slides) stand out in a presentation, 
change their background style or theme. A different background tells your 
audience that the slide being presented is a little different from the one 
before it. Maybe it imparts important information. Maybe it introduces 
another segment of the presentation. Use a different background style or 
theme to mark a transition, indicate that your presentation has shifted gears, 
or mark a milestone in your presentation.
Follow these steps to change the background of one or several slides in your 
presentation:
 
1. In Slide Sorter view, select the slides that need a different look.
 
 You can select more than one slide by Ctrl+clicking slides.
 
2. On the Design tab, choose a different theme or background for the 
slides you selected.
 
 How you do this depends on whether you’re working with a theme or a 
slide background:
 
• Theme: In the Themes Gallery, right-click a theme and choose Apply 
To Selected Slides. The same goes for theme colors, fonts, and 
effects: To apply a theme color, font, or effect, right-click it on the 
drop-down list and choose Apply to Selected Slides. (See “Choosing a 
Theme for Your Presentation” earlier in this chapter for details.)
 
• Slide background: Make like you’re creating a background style for 
all the slides (see “Creating Slide Backgrounds on Your Own” earlier 
in this chapter) but right-click a choice on the Background Styles 
drop-down list and choose Apply to Selected Slides. If you’re creating 
a background in the Format Background dialog box, click the Close 
button, not the Apply to All button.

Using Master Slides and Master Styles for a Consistent Design
 
When you assign a different theme to some of the slides in a presentation, 
PowerPoint creates another Slide Master. You may be surprised to discover 
that when you add a new slide to your presentation, a second, third, or 
fourth set of slide layouts appears on the New Slide drop-down list. These 
extra layouts appear because your presentation has more than one Slide 
Master. The next topic in this chapter, “Using Master Slides and Master 
Styles for a Consistent Design,” explains what Slide Masters are.
Using Master Slides and Master 
Styles for a Consistent Design
Consistency is everything in a PowerPoint design. Consistency of design is 
a sign of professionalism and care. In a consistent design, the fonts and font 
sizes on slides are consistent from one slide to the next, the placeholder 
text frames are in the same positions, and the text is aligned the same way 
across different slides. In the bulleted lists, each entry is marked with the 
same bullet character. If the corner of each slide shows a company logo, the 
logo appears in the same position.
It would be torture to have to examine every slide to make sure that it is 
consistent with the others. In the interest of consistency, PowerPoint offers 
master styles and master slides. A master slide is a model slide from which 
the slides in a presentation inherit their formats. A master style is a format 
that applies to many different slides. Starting from a master slide, you can 
change a master style and in so doing, reformat many slides the same way. 
These pages explain how master slides can help you quickly redesign a 
presentation.
Switching to Slide Master view
To work with master slides, switch to Slide Master view, as shown in Figure 
2-7. From this view, you can start working with master slides:
 
1. Go to the View tab.
 
 2. Click the Slide Master button.
In Slide Master view, you can select a master slide in the Slides pane, format 
styles on a master slide, and in this way reformat many different slides. 
(Click the Close Master View button or a view button such as Normal or 
Slide Sorter to leave Slide Master view.)

Understanding master slides and master styles
Master slides are special, high-powered slides. Use master slides to deliver 
the same formatting commands to many different slides. Whether the com-
mands affect all the slides in your presentation or merely a handful of slides 
depends on whether you format the Slide Master (the topmost slide in Slide 
Master view) or a layout (one of the other slides):
 
✦ The Slide Master: The Slide Master is the first slide in the Slides pane in 
Slide Master view (refer to Figure 2-7). It’s a little bigger than the master 
slides, as befits its status as Emperor of All Slides. Formatting changes 
you make to the Slide Master affect all the slides in your presentation. 
When you select a theme for your presentation, what you’re really doing 
is assigning a theme to the Slide Master. Because formatting commands 
given to the Slide Master apply throughout a presentation, the theme 
design and colors are applied to all slides. If you want a company logo to 
appear on all your slides, place the logo on the Slide Master.
 
✦ Layouts: As you know, you choose a slide layout — Title and Content, 
for example — on the New Slide drop-down list to create a new slide. 

392
Using Master Slides and Master Styles for a Consistent Design
In Slide Master view, PowerPoint provides one layout for each type of 
slide layout in your presentation. By selecting and reformatting a layout 
in Slide Master view, you can reformat all slides in your presentation 
that were created with the same slide layout. For example, to change 
fonts, alignments, and other formats on all slides that you created with 
the Title layout, select the Title layout in Slide Master view and change 
master styles on the Title layout. Each layout controls its own little 
fiefdom in a PowerPoint presentation — a fiefdom comprised of slides 
created with the same slide layout.
 
✦ Master styles: Each master slide — the Slide Master and each layout — 
offers you the opportunity to click to edit master styles (refer to Figure 
2-7). The master style governs how text is formatted on slides. By 
changing a master style on a master slide, you can change the look of 
slides throughout a presentation. For example, by changing the Master 
Title Style font, you can change fonts in all the slide titles in your 
presentation.
PowerPoint’s Slide Master–layouts–slides system is designed on the “trickle 
down” theory. When you format a master style on the Slide Master, formats 
trickle down to layouts and then to slides. When you format a master style 
on a layout, the formats trickle down to slides you created using the same 
slide layout. This chain-of-command relationship is designed to work from 
the top down, with the master slide and layouts barking orders to the slides 
below. In the interest of design consistency, slides take orders from layouts, 
and layouts take orders from the Slide Master.
 
In Slide Master view, you can move the pointer over a layout thumbnail in 
the Slides pane to see a pop-up box that tells you the layout’s name and 
which slides in your presentation “use” the layout. For example, a pop-up 
box that reads “Title and Content Layout: used by slide(s) 2-3, 8” tells you 
that slides 2 through 3 and 8 in your presentation are governed by the Title 
and Content layout.
Editing a master slide
 
 Now that you know the relationship among the Slide Master, layouts, and 
slides, you’re ready to start editing master slides. To edit a master slide, 
switch to Slide Master view, select a master slide, and change a master style. 
To insert a picture on a master slide, visit the Insert tab.
Changing a master slide layout
Changing the layout of a master slide entails changing the position and size 
of text frames and content frames as well as removing these frames:

✦ Changing size of frames: Select the frame you want to change, and then 
move the pointer over a frame handle on the corner, side, top or bottom 
of the frame and drag when you see the double-headed arrow.
 
✦ Moving frames: Move the pointer over the perimeter of a frame, click 
when you see the four-headed arrow, and drag.
 
✦ Removing a frame from the Slide Master: Click the perimeter of the 
frame to select it and then press Delete.
 
 
✦ Adding a frame to the Slide Master: Select the slide master, and on the 
Slide Master tab, click the Master Layout button. You see the Master 
Layout dialog box. Select the check box beside the name of each frame 
you want to add and click OK.

Chapter 3: Entering the Text
In This Chapter
✓ Entering and changing the font, size, and color of text
✓ Creating text boxes and text box shapes
✓ Handling overflow text in text boxes and frames
✓ Aligning the text in text boxes and text frames
✓ Creating bulleted and numbered lists
✓ Placing footers and headers on slides
T
his chapter explains how to change the appearance of text, create text 
boxes, and create text box shapes. I solve the riddle of what to do when 
text doesn’t fit in a text box or text placeholder frame. You also discover 
how to align text, handle bulleted and numbered lists, and put a footer on all 
or some of the slides in your presentation.
By the time you finish reading this chapter, if you read it all the way 
through, you will be one of those people others turn to when they have a 
PowerPoint question about entering text on slides. You’ll become a little 
guru in your own right.
Entering Text
No presentation is complete without a word or two, which is why the first 
thing you see when you add a new slide to a presentation are the words 
“Click to add text.” As soon as you “click,” those words of instruction disap-
pear, and you’re free to enter a title or text of your own. Most slides include 
a text placeholder frame at the top for entering a slide title; many slides also 
have another, larger text placeholder frame for entering a bulleted list.
As shown in Figure 3-1, the easiest way to enter text on slides is to click 
in a text placeholder frame and start typing. The other way is to switch to 
Normal view, select the Outline tab in the Slides pane (see Figure 3-1), and 
enter text there.

396

On the Slides pane in Normal/Outline view
In a text placeholder frame
Enter text on slides the same way you enter text in a Word document — by 
wiggling your fingers over the keyboard. While you’re at it, you can change 
fonts, the font size of text, and the color of text, as the following pages 
explain. (Chapter 1 of this mini-book describes how to get the text for slides 
from the headings in a Word document; Book I, Chapter 2 explains every-
thing a sane person needs to know about handling fonts.)
Choosing fonts for text
If you aren’t happy with the fonts in your presentation, you have three ways 
to remedy the problem:
 
✦ Dig in and choose new fonts on a slide-by-slide basis. Select the text, 
go to the Home tab, and choose a font from the Font drop-down list or 
the Font dialog box.
 
 
✦ Select new theme fonts for your presentation. Theme fonts are combi-
nations of fonts that the designers of PowerPoint themes deem appropri-
ate for the theme you’re working in. To change theme fonts, go to the 
Design tab, click the Fonts button, and select a new font combination.
 
✦ Choose a new font on a master slide to change fonts throughout 
your presentation. Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains master slides 
and how you can use them to change formats simultaneously on many 
slides. In Slide Master view, select a master slide and change its fonts on 
the Home tab.

Chapter 3

Changing the font size of text
For someone in the back row of an audience to be able to read text in a 
PowerPoint presentation, the text should be no smaller than 28 points. Try 
this simple test to see whether text in your presentation is large enough to 
read: Stand 5 or so feet from your computer and see whether you can read 
the text. If you can’t read it, make it larger.
Go to the Home tab and select the text whose size you want to change. Then 
use one of these techniques to change font sizes:
 
✦ Font Size drop-down list: Open this list and choose a point size. To 
choose a point size that isn’t on the list, click in the Font Size text box, 
enter a point size, and press Enter.
 
✦ Font dialog box: Click the Font group button to open the Font dialog 
box. Then either choose a point size from the Size drop-down list or 
enter a point size in the Size text box and click OK.
 
 
✦ Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons: Click these buttons 
(or press Ctrl+> or Ctrl+<) to increase or decrease the point size by the 
next interval on the Font Size drop-down list. Watch the Font Size list or 
your text and note how the text changes size. This is an excellent tech-
nique when you want to “eyeball it” and you don’t care to fool with the 
Font Size list or Font dialog box.
Changing the color of text
Before you change the color of text, peer into your computer screen and 
examine the background theme or color you selected for your slides. Unless 
the color of the text is different from the theme or color, the audience can’t 
read the text. Besides choosing a color that contributes to the overall tone 
of the presentation, select a color that’s easy to read.
Select the text that needs touching up and then use one of these techniques 
to change the color of text:
 
 
✦ On the mini-toolbar, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button 
and choose a color.
 
✦ On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Font Color button and 
choose a color.
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Font group button to open the Font dialog 
box, click the Font Color button in the dialog box, and choose a color on 
the drop-down list.
The Font Color drop-down list offers theme colors and standard colors. You 
are well advised to choose a theme color. These colors jive with the theme 
you choose for your presentation.

Fun with Text Boxes and Text Box Shapes
Fun with Text Boxes and Text Box Shapes
Text boxes give you an opportunity to exercise your creativity. They add 
another element to slides. Use them to position text wherever you want, 
annotate a chart or equation, or place an announcement on a slide. You can 
even create a vertical text box in which the text reads from top to bottom 
instead of left to right, or turn a text box into a circle, arrow, or other shape. 
Figure 3-2 shows examples of text boxes and text box shapes.
In Office terminology, a PowerPoint text box is an object. Book I, Chapter 8 
explains all the different techniques for handling objects, including how to 
make them overlap and change their sizes. Here are the basics of handling 
text boxes in PowerPoint:
In typesetting terminology, a top-heavy title 
is a title in which the first line is much longer 
than the second. Whenever a title extends to 
two lines, it runs the risk of being top-heavy. 
Unsightly top-heavy titles look especially bad 
on PowerPoint slides, where text is blown up to 
40 points or more. To fix a top-heavy title, click 
where you prefer the lines to break and then 
press Shift+Enter. Pressing Shift+Enter creates a 
hard line break, a forced break at the end of one 
line. (To remove a hard line break, click where 
the break occurs and then press the Delete key.)
The only drawback of hard line breaks is 
remembering where you made them. In effect, 
the line breaks are invisible. When you edit a 
title with a line break, the line break remains, 
and unless you know it’s there, you discover 
the line breaking in an odd place. The moral 
is: If you’re editing a title and the text keeps 
moving to the next line, you may have entered 
a hard line break and forgotten about it.

✦ Creating a text box: On the Insert tab, click the Text Box button and 
move the pointer to a part of the slide where you can see the text box 
pointer, a downward-pointing arrow. Then click and start dragging to 
create your text box, and enter the text.
 
✦ Filling a text box with a color style: On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, 
choose a style on the Shape Styles gallery.
 
✦ Rotating a text box (text included): Use one of these techniques to 
rotate a text box along with the text inside it:
 
• Drag the rotation handle, the green circle above the text box.
 
• On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Rotate button and 
choose a Rotate or Flip command on the drop-down list.
 
• On the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Size group button (you 
may have to click the Size button first) and, in the Size category of the 
Format Shape dialog box, enter a measurement in the Rotation box.
 
✦ Turning a shape into a text box: Create the shape, and then click in the 
shape and start typing. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to create a shape.)
 
 
✦ Turning a text box into a shape: Right-click the text box and choose 
Format Shape. In the Format Shape dialog box, click the Text Box cate-
gory and, under AutoFit, click the Do Not AutoFit option button. Then 
close the dialog box, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, click the Edit 
Shape button, choose Change Shape on the drop-down list, and choose a 
shape on the Change Shape submenu.

Many people object to the small text boxes that appear initially when you 
create a text box. If you prefer to establish the size of text boxes when 
you create them, not when you enter text, change the AutoFit setting and 
then create a default text box with the new setting. The next section in this 
chapter explains how to change the AutoFit settings.

Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
Controlling How Text Fits in 
Text Frames and Text Boxes
When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame or text box, PowerPoint 
takes measures to make it fit. In a text placeholder frame, PowerPoint shrinks 
the amount of space between lines and then it shrinks the text itself. When 
text doesn’t fit in a text box, PowerPoint enlarges the text box to fit more text. 
PowerPoint handles overflow text as part of its AutoFit mechanism.
How AutoFit works is up to you. If, like me, you don’t care for how PowerPoint 
enlarges text boxes when you enter the text, you can tell PowerPoint not to 
“AutoFit” text, but instead to make text boxes large from the get-go. And if you 
don’t care for how PowerPoint shrinks text in text placeholder frames, you 
can tell PowerPoint not to shrink text. These pages explain how to choose 
AutoFit options for overflow text in your text frames and text boxes.
Choosing how PowerPoint “AutoFits” 
text in text frames
 
 When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame and PowerPoint has to 
“AutoFit” the text, you see the AutoFit Options button. Click this button to 
open a drop-down list with options for handling overflow text, as shown in 
Figure 3-3. The AutoFit options — along with a couple of other techniques, as I 
explain shortly — represent the “one at a time” way of handling overflow text. 
You can also change the default AutoFit options for handling overflow text, as 
I also explain if you’ll bear with me a while longer and quit your yawning.

Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
“AutoFitting” the text one frame at a time
 
When text doesn’t fit in a text placeholder frame, especially a title frame, 
the first question to ask is, “Do I want to fool with the integrity of the slide 
design?” Making the text fit usually means shrinking the text, enlarging the 
text frame, or compromising the slide design in some way, but audiences 
notice design inconsistencies. Slides are shown on large screens where 
design flaws are easy to see.
Making text fit in a text frame usually means making a compromise. Here are 
different ways to handle the problem of text not fitting in a text frame. Be pre-
pared to click the Undo button when you experiment with these techniques:
 
✦ Edit the text: Usually when text doesn’t fit in a frame, the text needs 
editing. It needs to be made shorter. A slide is not a place for a treatise. 
Editing the text is the only way to make it fit in the frame without com-
promising the design.
 
✦ Enlarge the frame: Click the AutoFit Options button and choose Stop 
Fitting Text to This Placeholder on the shortcut menu (refer to Figure 
3-3). Then select the frame and drag the bottom or top selection handle 
to enlarge it.
 
 
✦ Decrease the font size: Select the text, go to the Home tab, and choose a 
smaller Font Size measurement. You can also click the Decrease Font 
Size button (or press Ctrl+<) to decrease the font size.
 
✦ Decrease the amount of spacing between lines: On the Home tab, 
click the Paragraph group button to open the Paragraph dialog box and 
decrease the After measurement under Spacing.
 
✦ Change the frame’s internal margins: Similar to a page, text frames 
have internal margins to keep text from getting too close to a frame 
border. By shrinking these margins, you can make more room for text. 
Right-click the text frame and choose Format Shape. Then, in the Text 
Box category of the Format Shape dialog box, enter smaller measure-
ments for the Internal Margin boxes.
 
✦ Create a new slide for the text: If you’re dealing with a list or paragraph 
text in a body text frame, the AutoFit Options drop-down list offers two 
ways to create a new slide (refer to Figure 3-3). Choose Continue on a 
New Slide to run the text onto another slide; choose Split Text Between 
Two Slides to divide the text evenly between two slides. I don’t recom-
mend either option, though. If you need to make a new slide, do it on 
your own and then rethink how to present the material. Inserting a new 
slide to accommodate a long list throws a presentation off-track.
Choosing default AutoFit options for text frames
Unless you change the default AutoFit options, PowerPoint shrinks the 
amount of space between lines and then shrinks the text itself to make text 

402
Controlling How Text Fits in Text Frames and Text Boxes
fit in text placeholder frames. Follow these steps if you want to decide for 
yourself whether PowerPoint “auto-fits” text in text frames:
 
1. Open the AutoFormat As You Type tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
 
 Here are the two ways to get there:
 
• Click the AutoFit Options button (refer to Figure 3-3) and choose 
Control AutoCorrect Options on the drop-down list.
 
• On the File tab, choose Options to open the PowerPoint Options 
dialog box. In the Proofing category, click the AutoCorrect Options 
button.
 
2. Deselect the AutoFit Title Text to Placeholder check box to prevent 
auto-fitting in title text placeholder frames.
 
3. Deselect the AutoFit Body Text to Placeholder check box to prevent 
auto-fitting in text placeholder frames apart from title frames.
 
4. Click OK.
Choosing how PowerPoint “AutoFits” 
text in text boxes
PowerPoint offers three options for handling overflow text in text boxes:
 
✦ Do Not AutoFit: Doesn’t fit text in the text box but lets text spill out
 
✦ Shrink Text on Overflow: Shrinks the text to make it fit in the text box
 
✦ Resize Shape to Fit Text: Enlarges the text box to make the text fit inside it
Follow these steps to tell PowerPoint how or whether to fit text in text boxes:
 
1. Select the text box.
 
2. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape.
 
 You see the Format Shape dialog box.
 
3. Go to the Text Box category.
 
4. Choose an AutoFit option: Do Not AutoFit, Shrink Text on Overflow, or 
Resize Shape to Fit Text.
 
5. Click the Close button.
 
Some people find it easier to dispense with “auto-fitting.” If you’re one of 
those people, go to the Text Box category of the Format Shape dialog box, 
and under AutoFit, choose the Do Not AutoFit option or the Shrink Text 
on Overflow option. To make your AutoFit setting applicable to all the text 
boxes you create in your presentation, right-click the text box and choose 
Set As Default Text Box on the shortcut menu.

Positioning Text in Frames and Text Boxes
Positioning Text in Frames and Text Boxes
How text is positioned in text frames and text boxes is governed by two sets 
of commands: the Align Text commands and the Align commands. By choos-
ing combinations of Align and Align Text commands, you can land text where 
you want it in a text frame or text box. Just wrestle with these two commands 
until you land your text where you want it to be in a text frame or box:
 
✦ Align commands control horizontal (left-to-right) alignments. On the 
Home tab, click the Align Left (press Ctrl+L), Center (press Ctrl+E), Align 
Right (press Ctrl+R), or Justify button.
 
 
✦ Align Text commands control vertical (up-and-down) alignments. On the 
Home tab, click the Align Text button and choose Top, Middle, or 
Bottom on the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 3-4.

Handling Bulleted and Numbered Lists
What is a PowerPoint presentation without a list or two? It’s like an emperor 
without any clothes on. This part of the chapter explains everything there is 
to know about bulleted and numbered lists.

404
Handling Bulleted and Numbered Lists
These lists can be as simple or complex as you want them to be. PowerPoint 
offers a bunch of different ways to format these lists, but if you’re in a hurry 
or you don’t care whether your lists look like everyone else’s, you can take 
advantage of the Numbering and Bullets buttons and go with standard lists. 
Nonconformists and people with nothing else to do, however, can try their 
hand at making fancy lists. The following pages cover that topic, too.
Creating a standard bulleted or numbered list
In typesetting terms, a bullet is a black, filled-in circle or other character that 
marks an item on a list. Many slide layouts include text frames that are already 
formatted for bulleted lists. All you have to do in these text frames is “click 
to add text” and keep pressing the Enter key while you enter items for your 
bulleted list. Each time you press Enter, PowerPoint adds another bullet to 
the list. Bulleted lists are useful when you want to present the audience with 
alternatives or present a list in which the items aren’t ranked in any order. Use 
a numbered list to rank items in a list or present step-by-step instructions.
Follow these instructions to create a standard bulleted or numbered list:
 
 
✦ Creating a bulleted list: Select the list if you’ve already entered the list 
items, go to the Home tab, and click the Bullets button. You can also right-
click, choose Bullets on the shortcut menu, and choose a bullet character 
on the submenu if you don’t care for the standard, black, filled-in circle.
 
 
✦ Creating a numbered list: Select the list if you’ve already entered the 
list items, go to the Home tab, and click the Numbering button. You can 
also right-click, choose Numbering on the shortcut menu, and select a 
numbering style on the submenu.
 
✦ Converting a numbered to a bulleted list (or vice versa): Drag over 
the list to select it, go to the Home tab, and then click the Bullets or 
Numbering button.
To remove the bullets or numbers from a list, select the list, open the drop-
down list on the Bullets or Numbering button, and choose None.
Choosing a different bullet character, size, and color
As Figure 3-5 demonstrates, the black filled-in circle isn’t the only charac-
ter you can use to mark items in a bulleted list. You can also opt for what 
PowerPoint calls pictures (colorful bullets of many sizes and shapes) or 
symbols from the Symbol dialog box. While you’re at it, you can change the 
bullets’ color and size.

you can use 
for bulleted 
lists.
 
 
If you decide to change the bullet character in your lists, be consistent 
from slide to slide. Unless you want to be goofy, select the same bullet char-
acter throughout the lists in your presentation for the sake of consistency. 
You don’t want to turn your slide presentation into a showcase for bullets, 
do you?
 
 To use pictures or unusual symbols for bullets, start by selecting your bul-
leted list, going to the Home tab, and opening the drop-down list on the 
Bullets button. Do any of the bullets on the drop-down list tickle your fancy? 
If one does, select it; otherwise, click the Bullets and Numbering option at 
the bottom of the drop-down list. You see the Bulleted tab of the Bullets and 
Numbering dialog box. Starting there, you can customize your bullets:
 
✦ Using a picture for bullets: Click the Picture button and select a bullet 
in the Picture Bullet dialog box.
 
✦ Using a symbol for bullets: Click the Customize button and select a 
symbol in the Symbol dialog box. By opening the Font drop-down list 
and choosing a Wingdings font, you can choose an oddball character 
for bullets.
 
✦ Changing bullets’ size: Enter a percentage figure in the Size % of Text 
box. For example, if you enter 200, the bullets are twice as large as the 
font size you choose for the items in your bulleted list.
 
✦ Changing bullets’ color: Click the Color button in the Bullets and 
Numbering dialog box and choose an option on the drop-down list. 
Theme colors are considered most compatible with the theme design 
you chose for your presentation.

406
Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
Choosing a different list-numbering 
style, size, and color
 
 PowerPoint offers seven different ways of numbering lists. As well as choos-
ing a different numbering style, you can change the size of numbers relative 
to the text and change the color of numbers. To select a different list-num-
bering style, size, or color, begin by selecting your list, going to the Home 
tab, and opening the drop-down list on the Numbering button. If you like one 
of the numbering-scheme choices, select it; otherwise, choose Bullets and 
Numbering to open the Numbered tab of the Bullets and Numbering dialog 
box. In this dialog box, you can customize list numbers:
 
✦ Choosing a numbering scheme: Select a numbering scheme and click OK.
 
✦ Changing the numbers’ size: Enter a percentage figure in the Size % of 
Text box. For example, if you enter 50, the numbers are half as big as the 
font size you choose for the items in your numbered list.
 
✦ Changing the numbers’ color: Click the Color button and choose a 
color on the drop-down list. Theme colors are more compatible with the 
theme design you chose than the other colors are.
Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
A footer is a line of text that appears at the foot, or bottom, of a slide. Figure 
3-6 shows a footer. Typically, a footer includes the date, a company name, 
and/or a slide number, and footers appear on every slide in a presentation 
if they appear at all. That doesn’t mean you can’t exclude a footer from a 
slide or put footers on some slides, as I explain shortly. For that matter, you 
can move slide numbers, company names, and dates to the top of slides, in 
which case they become headers. When I was a kid, “header” meant crashing 
your bike and falling headfirst over the handlebars. How times change.

Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
These pages explain everything a body needs to know about footers and 
headers — how to enter them, make them appear on all or some slides, and 
exclude them from slides.
Some background on footers and headers
PowerPoint provides the Header & Footer command to enter the date, a 
word or two, and a slide number on the bottom of all slides in your presenta-
tion. This command is really just a convenient way to enter a footer on the 
Slide Master without having to switch to Slide Master view. As Chapter 2 in 
this mini-book explains, the Slide Master governs the formatting and layout 
of all slides in your presentation. The Slide Master includes text placeholder 
frames for a date, some text, and a slide number. Anything you enter on the 
Slide Master, including a footer, appears on all your slides.
If a date, some text, and a slide number along the bottom of all the slides in 
your presentation is precisely what you want, you’ve got it made. You can 
enter a footer on every slide in your presentation with no trouble at all by 
using the Header & Footer command. However, if you’re a maverick and you 
want your footers and headers to be a little different from the next guy’s — if 
you want the date, for example, to be in the upper-right corner of slides or 
you want footers to appear on some slides but not others — you have some 
tweaking to do. You may have to create a nonstandard footer or remove the 
footer from some of the slides.
Putting a standard footer on all your slides
 
 A standard footer includes the date, some text, and the page number. To put 
a standard footer on all the slides in your presentation, go to the Insert tab and 
then click the Header & Footer button. You see the Header and Footer dialog 
box. Choose some or all of these options and click the Apply to All button:
 
✦ Date and Time: Select this check box to make the date appear in the 
lower-left corner of all your slides. Then tell PowerPoint whether you 
want a current or fixed date:
 
• Update Automatically: Select this option button to make the day’s date 
(or date and time) appear in the footer, and then open the drop-down 
list to choose a date (or date and time) format. With this option, the 
date you give your presentation always appears on slides.
 
• Fixed: Select this option button and enter a date in the text box. 
For example, enter the date you created the presentation. With this 
option, the date remains fixed no matter when or where you give the 
presentation.
 
✦ Slide Number: Select this check box to make slide numbers appear in 
the lower-right corner of all slides.
 
✦ Footer: Select this check box, and in the text box, enter the words that 
you want to appear in the bottom, middle of all the slides.

408
Putting Footers (and Headers) on Slides
Creating a nonstandard footer
As “Some background on footers and headers” explains earlier in this chap-
ter, you have to look elsewhere than the Header and Footer dialog box if you 
want to create something besides the standard footer. Suppose you want to 
move the slide number from the lower-right corner of slides to another posi-
tion? Or you want to fool with the fonts in headers and footers?
Follow these steps to create a nonstandard footer:
 
1. Create a standard footer if you want your nonstandard footer to 
include today’s date and/or a slide number.
 
 If you want to move the slide number into the upper-right corner of 
slides, for example, create a standard footer first (see the preceding sec-
tion in this chapter). Later, you can move the slide number text frame 
into the upper-right corner of slides.
 
 2. On the View tab, click the Slide Master button.
 
 You switch to Slide Master view. Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains 
this view and how to format many slides at one time with master slides.
 
3. Select the Slide Master, the topmost slide in the Slides pane.
 
4. Adjust and format the footer text boxes to taste (as they say in cookbooks).
 
 For example, move the slide number text frame into the upper-right 
corner to put slide numbers there. Or change the font in the footer text 
boxes. Or place a company logo on the Slide Master to make the logo 
appear on all your slides.
 
5. Click the Close Master View button to leave Slide Master view.
 
 You can always return to Slide Master view and adjust your footer.
Removing a footer from a single slide
On a crowded slide, the date, footer text, page number, and other items in 
the footer can get in the way or be a distraction. Fortunately, removing one 
or all of the footer text frames from a slide is easy:
 
1. Switch to Normal view and display the slide with the footer that needs 
removing.
 
 2. On the Insert tab, click the Header & Footer button.
 
 The Header and Footer dialog box appears.
 
3. Deselect check boxes — Date and Time, Slide Number, and Footer — 
to tell PowerPoint which parts of the footer you want to remove.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Be careful not to click the Apply to All button. Clicking this button 
removes footers throughout your slide presentation.

Chapter 4: Making Your 
Presentations Livelier
In This Chapter
✓ Looking at ways to make a presentation livelier
✓ Slapping a transition or animation on a slide
✓ Making sound a part of your presentation
✓ Playing video during a presentation
T
he purpose of this chapter is to make your presentation stand out in 
a crowd. It suggests ways to enliven your presentation with pictures, 
charts, slides, and tables. It shows how transitions and animations can make 
a presentation livelier. Finally, you discover how to play sound and video 
during a presentation.
Suggestions for Enlivening Your Presentation
Starting on the Insert tab, you can do a lot to make a presentation livelier. 
The Insert tab offers buttons for putting pictures, tables, charts, diagrams, 
shapes, and clip-art images on slides:
 
 
✦ Photos: Everyone likes a good photo, but more than that, audiences 
understand more from words and pictures than they do from words 
alone. A well-chosen photo reinforces the ideas that you’re trying to put 
across in your presentation. (See Book VIII, Chapter 3.)
 
 
✦ Tables: A table is a great way to plead your case or defend your posi-
tion. Raw table data is irrefutable — well, most of the time, anyway. 
Create a table when you want to demonstrate how the numbers back 
you up. (See Book I, Chapter 5.)
 
 
✦ Charts: Nothing is more persuasive than a chart. The bars, pie slices, or 
columns show the audience instantaneously that production is up or 
down, or that sector A is outperforming sector B. The audience can 
compare the data and see what’s what. (See Book I, Chapter 6.)
 
 
✦ Diagrams: A diagram is an excellent marriage of images and words. 
Diagrams allow an audience to literally visualize a concept, idea, or rela-
tionship. You can present an abstract idea such that the audience 
understands it better. (See Book I, Chapter 7.)

410
Suggestions for Enlivening Your Presentation
 
 
✦ Shapes: Lines and shapes can also illustrate ideas and concepts. You 
can also use them as slide decorations. (See Book I, Chapter 8.)
 
 
✦ Clip-art images: Clip-art images bring a little more color to presenta-
tions. They make presentations friendlier and easier to look at. (See 
Book VIII, Chapter 4.)
The grid is an invisible set of horizontal and 
vertical lines to which objects — clip-art 
images, pictures, and shapes — cling when 
you move them on a slide. The grid is meant to 
help objects line up squarely with one another. 
When you drag an object, it sticks to the near-
est point on the grid.
PowerPoint also offers the drawing guides for 
aligning objects. You can drag these vertical 
and horizontal lines on-screen and use them to 
align objects with precision.
To display the grid and the drawing guides:
 ✓ Displaying (and hiding) the grid: Press 
Shift+F9 or go to the View tab and select 
the Gridlines check box.
 ✓ Displaying (and hiding) the drawing 
guides: Press Alt+F9 or go to the View tab 
and select the Guides check box.
By default, objects when you move them “snap 
to the grid.” That means the objects stick to the 
nearest grid line when you move them across 
a slide. To control whether objects snap to the 
grid, right-click (but not on an object or frame), 
choose Grid and Guides, and in the Grid and 
Guides dialog box, deselect the Snap Objects 
to Grid check box.
Even if the Snap Objects to Grid check box in 
the Grid and Guides dialog box is selected, you 
can move objects without them snapping to a 
gridline by holding down the Alt key while you 
drag.
Select the Snap Objects to Other Objects check 
box if you want shapes to abut each other or 
fall along a common axis.

Exploring Transitions and Animations
Exploring Transitions and Animations
In PowerPoint-speak, a transition is a little bit of excitement that occurs as 
one slide leaves the screen and the next slide climbs aboard. An animation 
is movement on the slide. For example, you can animate bulleted lists such 
that the bullet points appear on a slide one at a time when you click the 
mouse, rather than all at one time.
 
Before you know anything about transitions and animations, you should 
know that they can be distracting. The purpose of a presentation is to com-
municate with the audience, not display the latest, busiest, most dazzling 
presentation technology. For user-run, kiosk-style presentations, however, 
eye-catching transitions and animations can be useful because they draw an 
audience. (A user-run presentation plays on its own, as I explain in Chapter 5 
of this mini-book.) For audiences that enjoy high-tech wizardry, transitions 
and animations can be a lot of fun and add to a presentation.
Showing transitions between slides
Transitions include the Switch, Fade, and Push. Figure 4-1 shows how a tran-
sition works. For the figure, I chose the Clock transition. This slide doesn’t 
so much arrive on-screen as it does sweep onto the screen in a clockwise 
manner. Don’t worry; you get a chance to test-drive these transitions before 
you attach them to slides.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Clock 
transition in 
action.
 
Assigning transitions to slides
To show transitions between slides, go to the Transitions tab, select the 
slide or slides that need transitions, and select a transition in the Transition 
to This Slide gallery. (To apply the same transition to all the slides in a pre-
sentation, click the Apply To All button after you select a transition.) The 
names and images in the gallery give you an idea of what the transitions are, 
and you can click the Preview button at any time to watch a transition you 
chose.

412
Exploring Transitions and Animations
The Transitions tab offers these tools for tweaking a transition:
 
 
✦ Effect Options: Click the Effect Options button and choose an effect on 
the drop-down list. For example, choose From Top or From Bottom to 
make a transition arrive from the top or bottom of the screen. Not all 
transitions offer effect options.
 
✦ Sound: Open the Sound drop-down list and choose a sound to accom-
pany the transition. The Loop Until Next Sound option at the bottom of 
the drop-down list plays a sound continuously until the next slide in the 
presentation appears.
 
✦ Duration: Enter a time period in the Duration box to declare how quickly 
or slowly you want the transition to occur.
As I mention earlier, you can click the Apply To All button to assign the same 
transition to all the slides in your presentation.
Altering and removing slide transitions
In the Slides pane and Slide Sorter view, the transition symbol, a flying star, 
appears next to slides that have been assigned a transition. Select the slides 
that need a transition change, go to the Transitions tab, and follow these 
instructions to alter or remove transitions:
 
✦ Altering a transition: Choose a different transition in the Transition 
to This Slide gallery. You can also choose different effect options and 
sounds, and change the duration of the transition.
 
✦ Removing a transition: Choose None in the Transition to This Slide 
gallery.
Animating parts of a slide
When it comes to animations, you can choose between animation schemes, 
the prebuilt special effects made by the elves of Microsoft, or customized 
animations that you build on your own. Only fans of animation and people 
with a lot of time on their hands go the second route.
Choosing a ready-made animation scheme
Follow these steps to preview and choose an animation scheme for slides:
 
1. Go to the Animations tab.
 
2. Click to select the element on the slide that you want to animate.
 
 For example, select a text frame with a bulleted list. You can tell when 
you’ve selected an element because a selection box appears around it.
 
3. In the Animation Styles gallery, choose an animation effect, as shown 
in Figure 4-2.

Chapter 4

Exploring Transitions and Animations
 
 You can choose Entrance, Emphasis, and Exit animation effects. As soon 
as you make your choice, the animation springs to life, and you can click 
the Preview button at any time to see your animation in all its glory.
 
 4. Click the Effect Options button and experiment with choices on the 
drop-down list to tweak your animation.
 
 Which options are available depends on the animation you chose.
 
5.  If you choose a text-box or text-frame element with more than 
one paragraph in Step 2, click the Effect Options button and tell 
PowerPoint whether to animate all the text or animate each para-
graph separately from the others.
 
• All at Once: All the text is animated at the same time.
 
• By Paragraph: Each paragraph is treated separately and is animated 
on its own. For example, each item in a bulleted list is treated as a 
separate element — each item fades, wipes, or flies in after the one 
before it, not at the same time as the one before it.
 
 Very briefly, you see a preview of the animation choice you made. To 
get a good look at the animation you just chose for your slide, click the 
Preview button on the Animations tab.

Fashioning your own animation schemes
 
 To fashion your own animation scheme, go to the Animations tab and click 
the Animation Pane button. You see the Animation pane (refer to Figure 4-2). 
It lists, in order, each animation that occurs on your slide (if animations 
occur). Select an element on the slide and follow these general instructions 
to animate it:
 
 
✦ Click the Add Animation button and choose an animation.
 
✦ On the Start drop-down list, declare whether the animation begins when 
you click your slide (On Click), at the same time as the previous anima-
tion (With Previous), or after the previous animation (After Previous).
 
✦ In the Duration box, enter how long you want the animation to last.
 
✦ In the Delay box, enter a time period to declare how soon after the previ-
ous animation in the Animation pane you want your animation to occur.
 
✦ Select an animation in the task pane and click a Re-Order button to 
change the order in which animations occur, if more than one element is 
animated on your slide.
Making Audio Part of Your Presentation
Especially in user-run, kiosk-style presentations, audio can be a welcome 
addition. Audio gives presentations an extra dimension. It attracts an audi-
ence. PowerPoint offers two ways to make audio part of a presentation:
 
✦ As part of slide transitions: A sound is heard as a new slide arrives 
on-screen. On the Transitions tab, open the Sound drop-down list and 
choose a sound. (See “Showing transitions between slides,” earlier in 
this chapter.)
 
✦ On the slide itself: The means of playing audio appears on the slide in 
the form of an Audio icon, as shown in Figure 4-3. By moving the mouse 
over this icon, you can display audio controls, and you can use these 
controls to play audio. You can also make audio play as soon as the 
slide arrives on-screen.
Table 4-1 describes the audio files you can use in PowerPoint presentations 
and whether each file type is a wave or MIDI sound. To find out what kind of 
audio file you’re dealing with, note the file’s three-letter extension; or open 
Windows Explorer or Computer, find the sound file, right-click it, and choose 
Properties.

Inserting an audio file on a slide
Follow these steps to insert an audio file in a slide:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 2. Click the Audio button.
 
 You see the Insert Audio dialog box.
 
3. Locate and select a sound file and then click Insert.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, Table 4-1 lists the type of sound files that you can 
play in presentations.

416
Making Audio Part of Your Presentation
 
An Audio icon appears on the slide to remind you that audio is supposed to 
play when your slide is on-screen. You can change the size of this icon by 
selecting it and dragging a corner handle or going to the (Audio Tools) 
Format tab and entering new Height and Width measurements. You can also 
drag the icon into an out-of-the-way corner of your slide.
To quit playing a sound file on a slide, select its Audio icon and then press 
the Delete key.
Telling PowerPoint when and 
how to play an audio file
To tell PowerPoint when and how to play an audio file, start by selecting the 
Audio icon and going to the (Audio Tools) Playback tab, as shown in Figure 
4-4. From there, you can control when and how audio files play:
 
 
✦ Controlling the volume: Click the Volume button and choose an option 
on the drop-down list to control how loud the audio plays.
 
✦ Deciding when to start playing audio: On the Start drop-down list, 
choose Automatically to make the audio play as soon as the slide 
appears; choose On Click to play the audio when you click the Audio 
icon on your slide. The Play Across Slides option plays the audio file 
throughout a presentation.

Playing Video on Slides
 
✦ Hiding and unhiding the Audio icon: Select the Hide During Show 
check box. If you hide the Audio icon, the file must play automatically; 
otherwise, you won’t see the icon and be able to click it and view the 
audio controls.
 
✦ Continuously playing audio: Select the Loop Until Stopped check box to 
play the audio file over and over again or until you move to the next slide.
Click the Play button on the (Audio Tools) Playback tab to play an audio file.
Playing audio during a presentation
While an audio file is playing during a presentation, controls for starting, 
pausing, and controlling the volume appear on-screen (refer to Figure 4-3). 
They appear on-screen, I should say, if the Audio icon appears on your slide. 
(If you’ve hidden the Audio icon, you’re out of luck because you can’t see 
the Audio icon or use its audio controls.)
Follow these instructions to start, pause, and control the volume of an audio 
recording during a presentation:
 
✦ Starting an audio file: Move the pointer over the Audio icon, and when 
you see the Audio controls, click the Play/Pause button (or press Alt+P).
 
✦ Pausing an audio file: Click the Play/Pause button (or press Alt+P). 
Click the button again to resume playing the audio file.
 
✦ Muting the volume: Click the Mute/Unmute icon (or press Alt+U).
 
✦ Controlling the volume: Move the pointer over the Mute/Unmute icon to 
display the volume slider and then drag the volume control on the slider.
Playing Video on Slides
If a picture is worth a thousand words, what is a moving picture worth? Ten 
thousand? To give your presentation more cachet, you can play video on 
slides and in so doing, turn your presentation into a mini-movie theater.
To play video, PowerPoint relies on Windows Media Player, the media 
player that comes with Windows. Therefore, to play video on a slide, stick 
to formats that Windows Media Player can handle: ASF (Advanced Systems 
Format), AVI (Audio Visual Interleaved), MPEG (Motion Picture Experts 
Group), MPG (Media Planning Group), WMV (Windows Media Video), MOV 
(QuickTime Video), and .SWF (Adobe Flash).

418
Playing Video on Slides
Inserting a video on a slide
Follow these steps to insert a video on a slide:
 
1. Open the Insert Video dialog box.
 
 You can open the dialog box with one of these techniques:
 
• Click the Media icon in a content placeholder frame.
 
 
• On the Insert tab, click the Video button.
 
2. Select a video file in the Insert Video dialog box and click Insert.
 
 
The video appears on your slide. If I were you, I would find out how (or 
whether) the video plays. To do that, click the Play/Pause button (or 
press Alt+P) or click the Play button on the (Video Tools) Playback or 
(Video Tools) Format tab.
Fine-tuning a video presentation
As shown in Figure 4-5, select the video and go to the (Video Tools) Playback 
tab to fine-tune a video presentation. The Playback tab offers all kinds of 
commands for making a video play the way you want it to play. Here are dif-
ferent ways to fine-tune a video presentation:

Playing Video on Slides
 
 
✦ Controlling the volume: Click the Volume button and choose Low, 
Medium, High, or Mute to control how loud the video sound is.
 
✦ Playing the video automatically or when you click the Play/Pause 
button: Open the Start drop-down list and choose Automatically or On 
Click to tell PowerPoint when to start playing the video.
 
✦ Playing the video at full screen: Make a video fill the entire screen by 
selecting the Play Full Screen check box. Be careful of this one. Videos 
can look terribly grainy when they appear on the big screen.
 
✦ Hiding the video when it isn’t playing: You can hide the video until you 
start playing it by selecting the Hide While Not Playing check box. Be 
sure to choose Automatically on the Start drop-down list if you select 
this check box.
 
✦ Continuously playing, or looping, the video: Play a video continuously 
or until you go to the next slide by selecting the Loop Until Stopped 
check box.
 
✦ Rewinding the video when it’s finished playing: Rewind a video if you 
want to see the first frame, not the last, when the video finishes playing. 
Select the Rewind After Playing check box to make the start of the video 
appear after the video plays; deselect this option to freeze-frame on the 
end of the video when it finishes playing.

Chapter 5: Delivering 
a Presentation
In This Chapter
✓ Writing, editing, and printing speaker notes
✓ Rehearsing a presentation to see how long it is
✓ Going from slide to slide in a live presentation
✓ Drawing on slides during a presentation
✓ Delivering a presentation when you can’t be there in person
A
t last, the big day has arrived. It’s time to give the presentation. “Break 
a leg,” as actors say before they go onstage. This chapter explains how 
to rehearse your presentation to find out how long it is and show your pre-
sentation. You discover some techniques to make your presentation livelier, 
including how to draw on slides with a pen or highlighter and blank out the 
screen to get the audience’s full attention. The chapter describes how to 
handle the speaker notes and print handouts for your audience. In case you 
can’t be there in person to deliver your presentation, this chapter shows 
you how to create a user-run presentation, a self-running presentation, a 
presentation designed to be viewed from a CD, and video of a presentation.
All about Notes
Notes are strictly for the speaker. They aren’t for the unwashed masses. Don’t 
hesitate to write notes to yourself when you put together your presentation. 
The notes will come in handy when you’re rehearsing and giving your presen-
tation. They give you ideas for what to say and help you communicate better. 
Here are instructions for entering, editing, and printing notes:
 
 ✦ Entering a note: To enter a note, start in Normal view, click in the Notes 
pane, and start typing. Treat the Notes pane like a page in a word pro-
cessor. For example, press Enter to start a new paragraph and press the 
Tab key to indent text. You can drag the border above the Notes pane 
up or down to make the pane larger or smaller.
 
 ✦ Editing notes in Notes Page view: After you’ve jotted down a bunch of 
notes, switch to Notes Page view and edit them. To switch to Notes 
Page view, visit the View tab and click the Notes Page button. Notes 
appear in a text frame below a picture of the slide to which they refer. 
You may have to zoom in to read them.

422
Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation
 
✦ Printing your notes: On the File tab, choose Print (or press Ctrl+P). You 
see the Print window. Under Settings, open the second drop-down list 
and choose Note Pages. Then click the Print button.
Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation
Slide presentations and theatrical presentations have this in common: They 
are as good as the number of times you rehearse them. Be sure to rehearse 
your presentation many times over. The more you rehearse, the more com-
fortable you are giving a presentation. Follow these steps to rehearse a pre-
sentation, record its length, and record how long each slide is displayed:
 
1. Select the first slide in your presentation.
 
2. Go to the Slide Show tab.
 
 3. Click the Rehearse Timings button.
 
 The Recording toolbar, shown in Figure 5-1, appears, and you switch to 
Slide Show view.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Timing the 
rehearsal.
 
Advance to the next slide
Note how long your presentation is
 
4. Give your presentation one slide at a time and click the Next button 
on the Recording toolbar to go from slide to slide.
 
 When each slide appears, imagine that you’re presenting it to an audi-
ence. Say what you intend to say during the real presentation. If you 
anticipate audience members asking questions, allot time for questions.
 
 The Recording toolbar tells you how long each slide has been displayed 
and how long your presentation is so far. You can do these tasks from 
the Recording toolbar:
 
• Go to the next slide: Click the Next button.
 
• Pause recording: Click the Pause Recording button to temporarily 
stop the recording so that you can feed the dog or take a phone call. 
Click the Resume Recording button to resume recording.
 
• Repeat a slide: Click the Repeat button if you get befuddled and want 
to start over with a slide. The slide timing returns to 0:00:00.

5. In the dialog box that asks whether you want to keep the slide tim-
ings, note how long your presentation is (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
 Is your presentation too long or too short? I hope, like baby bear’s por-
ridge, your presentation is “just right.” But if it’s too long or short, you have 
some work to do. You have to figure out how to shorten or lengthen it.
 
6. In the dialog box that asks whether you want to keep the new slide 
timings, click Yes if you want to see how long each slide stayed on-
screen during the rehearsal.
 
 By clicking Yes, you can go to Slide Sorter view and see how long each 
slide remained on-screen.
 
If you save the slide timings, PowerPoint assumes that, during a presentation, 
you want to advance to the next slide manually or after the recorded time, 
whichever comes first. For example, suppose the first slide in your presen-
tation remained on-screen for a minute during the rehearsal. During your 
presentation, the first slide will remain on-screen for a minute and automati-
cally yield to the second slide unless you click to advance to the second slide 
before the minute has passed. If you recorded slide timings strictly to find out 
how long your presentation is, you need to tell PowerPoint not to advance 
automatically to the next slide during a presentation after the recorded time 
period elapses. On the Slide Show tab, deselect the Use Timings check box.
Showing Your Presentation
Compared to the preliminary work, giving a presentation can seem kind of 
anticlimactic. All you have to do is go from slide to slide and woo your audi-
ence with your smooth-as-silk voice and powerful oratory skills. Well, at 
least the move-from-slide-to-slide part is pretty easy. These pages explain 
how to start and end a presentation, all the different ways to advance or 
retreat from slide to slide, and how to jump to different slides.
Starting and ending a presentation
Here are the different ways to start a presentation from the beginning:
 
 
✦ On the Slide Show tab, click the From Beginning button.
 
 
✦ Select the first slide and then click the Slide Show view button.
You can start a presentation in the middle by selecting a slide in the middle 
and then clicking the Slide Show view button or going to the Slide Show tab 
and clicking the From Current Slide button.
Here are the different ways to end a presentation prematurely:
 
✦ Press Esc, Ctrl+Break, or – (the Hyphen key).

424
Showing Your Presentation
 
✦ Click the Slide button and choose End Show on the pop-up menu. The 
Slide button is located in the lower-left corner of the screen.
 
✦ Right-click and choose End Show in the shortcut menu.
Going from slide to slide
In a nutshell, PowerPoint offers four ways to move from slide to slide in a 
presentation. Table 5-1 describes techniques for navigating a presentation, 
using the four different ways:
 
✦ Use the slide control buttons: Click a slide control button — Previous, 
Next — in the lower-left corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-2. If 
you don’t see the slide control buttons, jiggle the mouse.
 
✦ Click the Slide button: Click this button and make a choice on the 
pop-up menu (refer to Figure 5-2).
 
✦ Right-click on-screen: Right-click and choose a navigation option on the 
shortcut menu.
 
✦ Press a keyboard shortcut: Press one of the numerous keyboard short-
cuts that PowerPoint offers for going from slide to slide (see Table 5-1).

*If animations are on a slide, commands for going to the next slide instead make animations play in 
sequence. To bypass animations and go to the next slide, use a command for going forward across 
several slides. (See “Jumping forward or backward to a specific slide.”)
Going forward (or backward) from slide to slide
To go forward from one slide to the following slide in a presentation, click 
on-screen. After you click, the next slide appears. If all goes well, clicking is 
the only technique you need to know when giving a presentation to go from 
slide to slide, but Table 5-1 lists other ways to go to the next slide in a pre-
sentation as well as techniques for going backward to the previous slide.
 
To go to the first slide in a presentation, press Home; to go to the last slide, 
press End.

426
Tricks for Making Presentations a Little Livelier
Jumping forward or backward to a specific slide
If you find it necessary to jump forward or backward across several slides in 
your presentation to get to the slide you want to show, it can be done with 
these techniques:
 
✦ Either click the Slide button or right-click, choose Go to Slide, and then 
choose a slide in your presentation on the submenu (refer to Figure 5-2). 
If you created sections for your presentation, you can choose Go To 
Section and then choose a section name on the submenu.
 
✦ Press Ctrl+S. You see the All Slides dialog box. It lists all slides in your pre-
sentation. Select the slide you want to show and click the Go To button.
 
✦ Press the slide number you want on your keyboard (if you can remem-
ber the slide’s number) and then press the Enter key. For example, to 
show the third slide in your presentation, press 3 and then press Enter.
 
If you need to return to where you started after you make the jump to a dif-
ferent slide, you can do so by right-clicking and choosing Last Viewed on the 
shortcut menu. You can also click the Slide button and choose Last Viewed 
(refer to Figure 5-2). The Last Viewed command takes you to the last slide 
you showed, wherever it is in your presentation.
Tricks for Making Presentations a Little Livelier
To make presentations a little livelier, whip out a pen and draw on a slide or 
blank the screen. Draw to underline words or draw check marks as you hit 
the key points, as shown in Figure 5-3. Drawing on slides is an excellent way 
to add a little something to a presentation. Blank the screen when you want 
the audience’s undivided attention.
Wielding a pen or highlighter in a presentation
Follow these instructions so that you can draw on a slide:
 
✦ Selecting a pen or highlighter: PowerPoint offers the Pen for writing on 
slides and the Highlighter for highlighting text on slides. To select the 
Pen or Highlighter, click the Pen button and choose Pen or Highlighter 
(refer to Figure 5-3). You can also right-click, choose Pointer Options, 
and make a selection on the submenu.
 
✦ Choosing a color for drawing: After you select the Pen or Highlighter, 
click the Pen button, choose Ink Color, and select a color on the sub-
menu (refer to Figure 5-3).

Figure 5-3:

pen and ink 
color on the 
Pen pop-up 
list.
 
Press Esc when you’re finished using the pen. (Just be careful not to press Esc 
twice because the second press tells PowerPoint to end the presentation.)
Hiding and erasing pen and highlighter markings
Follow these instructions to hide and erase pen and highlighter markings:
 
✦ Temporarily showing or hiding markings: Right-click and choose 
Screen➪Show/Hide Ink Markup.
 
✦ Permanently erasing markings one at a time: Click the Pen button and 
choose Eraser (or right-click and choose Pointer Options➪Eraser). The 
Eraser appears. Click a line to erase it. Press Esc after you’re finished 
using the Eraser.
 
✦ Permanently erasing all the markings on a slide: Press E or click the 
Pen button and choose Erase All Ink on Slide (refer to Figure 5-3).
 
✦ Erasing markings you told PowerPoint to keep: As I explain shortly, 
PowerPoint asks at the end of a presentation that you drew on or high-
lighted whether you want to keep the markings. If you elect to keep them, 
the markings become part of your presentation, and you can’t delete them 

428
Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
by clicking with the Eraser or by choosing the Erase All Ink on Slide com-
mand. To discard these markings later, go to the Review tab, open the 
drop-down list on the Delete button, and choose one of these options:
 
• Delete All Markup on the Current Slide: Deletes markings you made on 
a slide you selected
 
• Delete All Markup in This Presentation: Deletes markings you made on 
all the slides in your presentation
Markings aren’t permanent, although you can keep them. At the end of 
a presentation in which you have marked on slides, a dialog box asks 
whether you want to keep or discard your markings. Click the Keep or 
Discard button. (If you prefer not to see this dialog box because you intend 
never to keep your markings, go to the File tab and choose Options. In the 
PowerPoint Options dialog box, select the Advanced category and deselect 
the Prompt to Keep Ink Annotations When Exiting check box.)
Blanking the screen
 
Here’s a technique for adding a little drama to a presentation: When you 
want the audience to focus on you, not the PowerPoint screen, blank the 
screen. Make an all-black or all-white screen appear where a PowerPoint 
slide used to be. Every head in the audience will turn your way and listen 
keenly to what you have to say next. I sure hope that you have something 
important to say.
Follow these instructions to blank out the screen during a presentation:
 
✦ Black screen: Press B, the period key, or right-click and choose 
Screen➪Black Screen.
 
✦ White screen: Press W, the comma key, or right-click and choose 
Screen➪White Screen.
To see a PowerPoint slide again, click on-screen or press any key on the 
keyboard.
Delivering a Presentation When 
You Can’t Be There in Person
PowerPoint offers numerous ways to deliver a presentation when you can’t be 
there in person. You can deliver your presentation in the form of a handout, a 
printed version of the presentation with thumbnail slides; create a self-running 
presentation; or create a user-run presentation with action buttons that others 
can click to get from slide to slide. The rest of this chapter explains how to do 
all that as well as package your presentation so that people who don’t have 
PowerPoint can view it and make a video of your presentation.

Chapter 5

Book VIII, Chapter 2 describes two more ways to distribute PowerPoint 
presentations — by saving them as PDF files and publishing them on the 
Internet.
Providing handouts for your audience
Handouts are thumbnail versions of slides that you print and distribute to 
the audience. Figure 5-4 shows examples of handouts. Handouts come in 
one, two, three, four, six, or nine slides per page. If you select three slides 
per page, the handout includes lines that your audience can take notes on 
(see Figure 5-4); the other sizes don’t offer these lines.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Examples 
of handouts 
(from left 
to right) at 
one, three, 
six, and nine 
slides per 
page.
 
 
 To tell PowerPoint how to construct handouts, go to the View tab and click 
the Handout Master button. In Handout Master view, on the Handout Master 
tab, you can do a number of things to make your handouts more useful and 
attractive. As you make your choices, keep your eye on the sample handout 
page; it shows what your choices mean in real terms.
 
✦ Handout Orientation: Select Portrait or Landscape. In landscape mode, 
the page is turned on its side and is longer than it is tall.
 
✦ Slide Orientation: Select Portrait or Landscape, although I can’t think of 
a good reason to choose Portrait.
 
✦ Slides-Per-Page: Open the drop-down list and choose how many slides 
appear on each page. Figure 5-4 shows what some of the choices are.
 
✦ Header: Select the Header check box and enter a header in the text 
frame to make a header appear in the upper-left corner of all handout 
pages. Candidates for headers include your name, your company name, 
and the location of a conference or seminar. The point is to help your 
audience identify the handout.
 
✦ Footer: Select the Footer check box and enter a footer in the text frame 
in the lower-left corner of handout pages. Candidates for footers are the 
same as candidates for headers.

430
Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
 
✦ Date: Select this check box if you want the date you print the handout to 
appear on the handout pages.
 
✦ Page Number: Select this check box if you want page numbers to appear 
on the handout pages.
 
✦ Background Styles: Open the Background Styles drop-down list and 
select a gradient or color, if you’re so inclined. Chapter 2 of this mini-
book explains background styles. Make sure that the background 
doesn’t obscure the slide thumbnails or put too much of a burden on 
your printer.
To print handouts, go to the File tab and choose Print (or press Ctrl+P). You 
see the Print window. Under Settings, open the second drop-down list, and 
under Handouts, choose how many slides to print on each page. Then click 
the Print button.
Creating a self-running, kiosk-style presentation
A self-running, kiosk-style presentation is one that plays on its own. You can 
make it play from a kiosk or simply send it to co-workers so that they can 
play it. In a self-running presentation, slides appear on-screen one after the 
other without you or anyone else having to advance the presentation from 
slide to slide. When the presentation finishes, it starts all over again from 
Slide 1.
Telling PowerPoint how long to keep slides on-screen
PowerPoint offers two ways to indicate how long you want each slide to stay 
on-screen:
 
✦ Entering the time periods yourself: Switch to Slide Sorter view and go 
to the Transitions tab. Then deselect the On Mouse Click check box and 
select the After check box, as shown in Figure 5-5. Next, tell PowerPoint 
to keep all slides on-screen the same amount of time or choose a differ-
ent time period for each slide:
 
• All slides at the same time: Enter a time period in the After text box 
and click the Apply to All button.
 
• Each slide at a different time: One by one, select each slide and enter 
a time period in the After text box.
 
✦ Rehearsing the presentation: Rehearse the presentation and save the 
timings. (See “Rehearsing and Timing Your Presentation,” earlier in this 
chapter.) Be sure to save the slide timings after you’re finished rehears-
ing. In Slide Sorter view, you can see how long each slide will stay on-
screen (refer to Figure 5-5).

Telling PowerPoint that your presentation is self-running
Before you can “self-run” a presentation, you have to tell PowerPoint that 
you want it to do that. Self-running presentations don’t have the control 
buttons in the lower-left corner. You can’t click the screen or press a key to 
move forward or backward to the next or previous slide. The only control 
you have over a self-running presentation is pressing the Esc key (pressing 
Esc ends the presentation).
Follow these steps to make yours a kiosk-style, self-running presentation:
 
1. Go to the Slide Show tab.
 
 2. Click the Set Up Slide Show button.
 
 You see the Set Up Slide Show dialog box.
 
3. Under Show Type, select the Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen) option.
 
 When you select this option, PowerPoint automatically selects the Loop 
Continuously Until ‘Esc’ check box.
 
4. Make sure that the Using Timings, If Present option button is selected.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 That’s all there is to it.

432
Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
Creating a user-run presentation
A user-run, or interactive, presentation is one that the viewer gets to con-
trol. The viewer decides which slide appears next and how long each slide 
remains on-screen. User-run presentations are similar to Web sites. Users 
can browse from slide to slide at their own speed. They can pick and choose 
what they want to investigate. They can backtrack and view slides they saw 
previously or return to the first slide and start anew.
Self-run presentations are shown in Reading view (click the Reading View 
view button on the status bar to see what self-run presentations looks like). 
A taskbar appears along the bottom of the screen. On the right side of the 
taskbar, viewers can click the Previous button or Next button to go from 
slide to slide. They can also click the Menu button to open a pop-up menu 
with commands for navigating slides.
Another way to help readers get from slide to slide is to create action but-
tons. An action button is a button that you can click to go to another slide 
in your presentation or the previous slide you viewed, whatever that slide 
was. PowerPoint provides 11 action buttons in the Shapes gallery. Figure 5-6 
shows some action buttons and the dialog box you use to create them.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Action 
buttons.
 
Drawing an action button
After you draw an action button from the Shapes gallery, the Action Settings 
dialog box (refer to Figure 5-6) appears so that you can tell PowerPoint which 
slide to go to when the button is clicked. Select the slide (or master slide) that 
needs action and follow these steps to adorn it with an action button:
 
1. On the Home or Insert tab, open the Shapes gallery and scroll to the 
Action Buttons category at the bottom.
 
2. Click an action button to select it.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Delivering a

433
Delivering a Presentation When You Can’t Be There in Person
 
 Choose the button that best illustrates which slide will appear when the 
button is clicked.
 
3. Draw the button on the slide.
 
 To do so, drag the pointer in a diagonal fashion. (As far as drawing them 
is concerned, action buttons work the same as all other shapes and 
other objects. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate objects.) 
The Action Settings dialog box (refer to Figure 5-6) appears after you 
finish drawing your button.
 
4. Go to the Mouse Over tab if you want users to activate the button by 
moving the mouse pointer over it, not clicking it.
 
5. Select the Hyperlink To option button.
 
6. On the Hyperlink To drop-down list, choose an action for the button.
 
 You can go to the next slide, the previous slide, the first or last slide in a 
presentation, the last slide you viewed, or a specific slide.
 
 To make clicking the action button take users to a specific slide, choose 
Slide on the list. You see the Hyperlink to Slide dialog box, which lists 
each slide in your presentation. Select a slide and click OK.
 
7. To play a sound when your action button is activated, select the Play 
Sound check box and select a sound on the drop-down list.
 
 “Mouse-over” hyperlinks can do with sound accompaniment so that 
users understand when they’ve activated an action button.
 
8. Click OK in the Actions Settings dialog box.
 
 To test your button, you can right-click it and choose Open Hyperlink.
 
 To change a button’s action, select it and then click the Action button on the 
Insert tab, or right-click your action button and choose Edit Hyperlink. In the 
Action Settings dialog box, choose a new action and click OK.
Making yours a user-run presentation
Follow these steps to declare yours a user-run presentation:
 
1. Go to the Slide Show tab.
 
 2. Click the Set Up Slide Show button.
 
 You see the Set Up Show dialog box.
 
3. Select the Browsed by an Individual (Window) option button.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Your presentation is no longer quite yours. It also belongs to all the 
people who view it in your absence.

Packaging your presentation on a CD
The Package for CD command copies a presentation to a CD so that you can 
take a presentation on the road or distribute it to others on CDs. By using 
the Package for CD command, you can even distribute a presentation to 
people who don’t have PowerPoint. Someone who doesn’t have PowerPoint 
can download the PowerPoint Viewer, an abridged version of PowerPoint 
with all the PowerPoint slide-show commands (but none of the slide-
creation commands). With the Package for CD command, you don’t have to 
be concerned whether someone to whom you give your presentation has 
PowerPoint or whether PowerPoint is installed on the computer where you 
will give your presentation.
These pages explain the ins and outs of the Package for CD command. You 
find out how to copy a presentation to a CD or folder and play a presentation 
in PowerPoint Viewer.
Packaging a presentation on a CD
Follow these steps to copy your presentation and the PowerPoint Viewer to 
a CD or a folder:
 
1. Open the presentation you want to package.
 
 2. On the File tab, choose Save & Send.
 
3. Choose Package Presentation for CD, and click the Package for CD 
button.
 
 You see the Package for CD dialog box shown in Figure 5-7.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Packaging 
a CD to 
distribute to 
others.
 
 
4. Enter a name for the CD or folder in the Name the CD text box.
 
 The name you enter will appear as the name of the CD if you view the CD 
in Windows Explorer or Computer; if you’re copying your presentation 
to a folder, the name you enter will be given to the folder PowerPoint 
creates when it creates the packaged presentation file.

5. Create the packaged presentation and copy it to a CD or to a folder on 
your computer.
 
 Copy the presentation to a folder if you want to send the presentation 
by e-mail rather than distribute it by CD.
 
• Copying to a CD: Click the Copy to CD button.
 
• Copying to a folder: Click the Copy to Folder button. In the Copy 
to Folder dialog box, click the Browse button, and in the Choose 
Location dialog box, select a folder for storing the folder where you 
will keep your packaged presentation. Then click the Select button 
and click OK in the Copy to Folder dialog box.
 
6. Click Yes in the message box that asks if you want to include linked 
content in the presentation.
 
 It can take PowerPoint several minutes to assemble the files and copy 
them to the CD or folder.
 
 If you’re copying your presentation to a CD, PowerPoint asks whether 
you want to copy the same presentation to another CD. Either insert a 
fresh CD and click Yes, or click the No button.
Not everyone has PowerPoint. Not every-
one is so blessed. Some people live along in 
ignorant bliss without knowing anything about 
PowerPoint and its slide-show capabilities.
Don’t be discouraged if you want to send your 
PowerPoint presentation to someone who 
doesn’t have or may not have PowerPoint. 
Someone who doesn’t have PowerPoint on 
his or her computer can still play a PowerPoint 
presentation by way of PowerPoint Viewer, a 
software program you can download for free 
from Microsoft starting at this Web page (enter 
PowerPoint Viewer in the Search text box and 
click the Go button):
www.microsoft.com/downloads
Here are instructions for running a presenta-
tion in PowerPoint Viewer:
 ✓ Getting from slide to slide: Click on-screen 
or right-click and choose Next on the 
shortcut menu.
 ✓ Retreating: Right-click and choose 
Previous or Last Viewed.
 ✓ Going to a specific slide: Right-click, 
choose Go to Slide, and select a slide on 
the submenu.
 ✓ Ending the show: Press Esc or right-click 
and choose End Show.

As shown in Figure 5-8, the AutoPlay dialog box appears when you put a 
CD-packaged PowerPoint presentation in the computer’s CD drive. Tell the 
people to whom you distribute your CD that they can play the presentation 
starting in this dialog box whether or not PowerPoint is installed on their 
computers:
 
✦ PowerPoint (or PowerPoint Viewer) is installed: Click the Open Folder 
to View Files button in the AutoPlay dialog box. The Computer applica-
tion opens to show the files on the CD. Double-click the PowerPoint pre-
sentation to play it.
 
✦ PowerPoint isn’t installed: Click the Run Presentation Package button 
in the AutoPlay dialog box. A Web browser opens. Click the Download 
Viewer button to go to a Web page at Microsoft.com and download 
the PowerPoint Viewer. After downloading and installing PowerPoint 
Viewer, you can use it to play the PowerPoint presentation.

Creating a presentation video
Yet another way to distribute a video is to record it in a WMV (Windows 
Media Video) file and distribute the file on a CD, distribute it by e-mail, or 
post it on the Internet. PowerPoint offers a command for creating a WMV-
file version of a presentation. Every aspect of a PowerPoint presentation, 
including transitions, animations, sound, video itself, and voice narrations, is 
recorded in the presentation video.
Figure 5-9 shows a WMV-file version of a PowerPoint presentation being 
played in Windows Media Player. This utility comes with the Windows 
operating system. Everyone with a computer that runs Windows can play 
WMV-file versions of your presentations by playing them in Windows Media 
Player.

Before creating your presentation video, consider how long you want each 
slide to appear on-screen. You can make each slide appear for a specific 
length of time or make all slides appear for the same length of time. To 
decide for yourself how long each slide appears, switch to Slide Sorter view, 
go to the Transitions tab, and for each slide, select the After check box and 
enter a measurement in the After text box. (Earlier in this chapter, “Creating 
a self-running, kiosk-style presentation” explains in detail how to establish 
how long each slide stays on-screen.)
Follow these steps to create a WMV-file version of a PowerPoint presentation:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Save & Send.
 
2. Choose Create a Video.
 
 You see the Create a Video window.
 
3. Open the first drop-down list and choose a display resolution for your 
video.
 
4. Open the second drop-down list and choose whether to use recorded 
timings and narrations.
 
 Your choices are twofold. If you recorded a voice narration for your 
PowerPoint presentation (a topic not covered in this book), choose the 
second option if you want to preserve the voice narration in the video.

• Don’t Use Recorded Timings and Narrations: Each slide stays on-
screen for the same amount of time. Enter a time period in the 
Seconds to Spend on Each Slide box to declare how long each slide 
stays on-screen.
 
• Use Recorded Timings and Narrations: Each slide stays on-screen for 
the time period listed on the Transition tab (see the Tip at the start of 
this section to find out how to list slide times on the Transition tab).
 
5. Open the second drop-down list and choose Preview Timings and 
Narrations.
 
 Your presentation video plays. How do you like it? This is what your 
video will look and sound like after you save it in a WMV file.
 
6. Click the Create Video button.
 
 The Save As dialog box opens.
 
7. Choose a folder for storing the WMV file, enter a name for the file, 
and click the Save button.
 
 The status bar along the bottom of the PowerPoint screen shows the 
progress of the video as it is being created. Creating a video can take sev-
eral minutes, depending on how large your PowerPoint presentation is 
and how many fancy gizmos, such as sound and animation, it contains.

T
his chapter introduces Excel, the official number cruncher of Office 
2010. The purpose of Excel is to track, analyze, and tabulate numbers. 
Use the program to project profits and losses, formulate a budget, or ana-
lyze Elvis sightings in North America. Doing the setup work takes time, but 
after you enter the numbers and tell Excel how to tabulate them, you’re on 
Easy Street. Excel does the math for you. All you have to do is kick off your 
shoes, sit back, and see how the numbers stack up.
This chapter explains what a workbook and a worksheet are and how rows 
and columns on a worksheet determine where cell addresses are. You also 
discover tips and tricks for quickly entering data in a worksheet, and how to 
construct data-validation rules to make sure that data is entered accurately.
Creating a New Excel Workbook
When you start Excel, the program greets you with a brand-new workbook 
with the generic name “Book1” on the title bar. Workbook is just the Excel 
term for the files you create with the program. You can start working right 
away on the generic workbook or you can take advantage of one of Excel’s 
templates.
A template is a preformatted workbook designed for a specific purpose, 
such as budgeting, tracking inventories, or tracking purchase orders. 
Creating a workbook from a template is mighty convenient if you happen to 
find a template that suits your purposes, but in my experience, you almost 
always have to start from a generic, blank workbook because your data is 
your own. You need a workbook you create yourself, not one created from a 
template by someone else.

442
Creating a New Excel Workbook
 
 Whether you want to create a new workbook from a template or from 
scratch, start by going to the File tab and choosing New. You see the 
Available Templates window shown in Figure 1-1. This window offers tem-
plates for creating many kinds of workbooks. Click a template to see, on 
the right side of the window, a preview of the workbook you will create. 
Double-click a template (or select it and click the Create button) to create 
a new workbook.

Use one of these techniques in the Available Templates window to create a 
workbook:
 
✦ Create a blank workbook: Double-click the Blank Workbook icon. (By 
pressing Ctrl+N, you can create a new, blank workbook without opening 
the Available Templates window.)
 
✦ Create a workbook from a template: Take your pick from these tech-
niques to create a workbook from a template:
 
• Use a template on your computer: Click Sample Templates. Templates 
that you loaded on your computer when you installed Office appear 
in the window.

Getting Acquainted with Excel
 
• Download a template from Office.com: Under Office.com Templates, 
either choose the type of template you want or make sure that your 
computer is connected to the Internet, enter a search term in the 
Search box, and click the Start Searching button (or press Enter). 
Choose a template and click the Download button to download it to 
your computer.
 
• Use a template you created (or downloaded earlier from Microsoft): 
Click the My Templates icon. The New dialog box appears. Select a 
template and click OK. (Chapter 4 of this mini-book describes how 
to create your own template; after you create a template, its name 
appears in this dialog box.)
 
• Select a recently used template: Click the Recent Templates icon and 
double-click a template name.
 
✦ Recycle another workbook: If you can use another workbook as the 
starting point for creating a new one, click the New from Existing icon. 
In the New from Existing Workbook dialog box, select the workbook and 
click the Create New button.
Book I, Chapter 1 explains how to save a workbook after you create it as well 
as how to open a workbook that you want to work on.
Getting Acquainted with Excel
If you’ve spent any time in an Office program, much of the Excel screen may 
look familiar to you. The buttons on the Home tab — the Bold and the Align 
buttons, for example — work the same in Excel as they do in Word. The Font 
and Font Size drop-down lists work the same as well. Any command in Excel 
that has to do with formatting text and numbers works the same in Excel 
and Word.
As I mention earlier, an Excel file is a workbook. Each workbook comprises 
one or more worksheets. A worksheet, also known as a spreadsheet, is a table 
where you enter data and data labels. Figure 1-2 shows a worksheet with 
data about rainfall in different counties.
A worksheet works like an accountant’s ledger — only it’s much easier to 
use. Notice how the worksheet is divided by gridlines into columns (A, B, 
C, and so on) and rows (1, 2, 3, and so on). The rectangles where columns 
and rows intersect are cells, and each cell can hold one data item, a formula 
for calculating data, or nothing at all. At the bottom of the worksheet are 
tabs — Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 — for visiting the other worksheets in 
the workbook.

444

Active cell address
Formula bar
Worksheet tabs
Active cell
Each cell has a different cell address. In Figure 1-2, cell B7 holds 13, the 
amount of rain that fell in Sonoma County in the winter. Meanwhile, as the 
Formula bar at the top of the screen shows, cell F7, the active cell, holds the 
formula =B7+C7+D7+E7, the sum of the numbers in cells — you guessed it — 
B7, C7, D7, and E7.
The beauty of Excel is that the program does all the calculations and recal-
culations for you after you enter the data. If I were to change the number 
in cell B7, Excel would instantly recalculate the total amount of rainfall in 
Sonoma County in cell F7. People like myself who struggled in math class will 
be glad to know that you don’t have to worry about the math because Excel 
does it for you. All you have to do is make sure that the data and the formu-
las are entered correctly.
After you enter and label the data, enter the formulas, and turn your work-
sheet into a little masterpiece, you can start analyzing the data. You can 
also generate charts like the one in Figure 1-3. Do you notice any similarities 
between the worksheet in Figure 1-2 and the chart in Figure 1-3? The chart is 
fashioned from data in the worksheet, and it took me about a half minute to 
create that chart. (Book I, Chapter 6 explains how to create charts in Excel, 
Word, and PowerPoint.)

Rows, columns, and cell addresses
Not that anyone except an Enron accountant needs all of them, but an Excel 
worksheet has numerous columns and over 1 million rows. The rows are 
numbered, and columns are labeled A to Z; then AA to AZ; then BA to BZ, 
and so on. The important thing to remember is that each cell has an address 
whose name comes from a column letter and a row number. The first cell in 
row 1 is A1, the second is B1, and so on. You need to enter cell addresses in 
formulas to tell Excel which numbers to compute.
To find a cell’s address, either make note of which column and row it lies 
in, or click the cell and glance at the Formula bar (refer to Figure 1-2). The 
left side of the Formula bar lists the address of the active cell, the cell that is 
selected in the worksheet. In Figure 1-2, cell F7 is the active cell.
Workbooks and worksheets
When you create a new Excel file, you open a workbook, a file with three 
worksheets in it. The worksheets are called Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 (you 
can change their names and add more worksheets). To get from worksheet 
to worksheet, click tabs along the bottom of the Excel window. Why three 
worksheets? Because you might need more than one worksheet for a single 
project. Think of a workbook as a stack of worksheets. Besides calculating 
the numbers in cells across the rows or down the columns of a worksheet, 
you can make calculations throughout a workbook by using numbers from 
different worksheets in a calculation.
Entering Data in a Worksheet
Entering data in a worksheet is an irksome activity. Fortunately, Excel offers 
a few shortcuts to take the sting out of it. These pages explain how to enter 
data in a worksheet, the different types of data, and how to enter text labels, 
numbers, dates, and times.

446
Entering Data in a Worksheet
The basics of entering data
What you can enter in a worksheet cell falls in four categories:
 
✦ Text
 
✦ A value (numeric, date, or time)
 
✦ A logical value (True or False)
 
✦ A formula that returns a value, logical value, or text
Still, no matter what type of data you’re entering, the basic steps are the same:
 
1. Click the cell where you want to enter the data or text label.
 
 As shown in Figure 1-4, a square appears around the cell to tell you that 
the cell you clicked is now the active cell. Glance at the left side of the 
Formula bar if you’re not sure of the address of the cell you’re about to 
enter data in. The Formula bar lists the cell address.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Entering 
data.
 
Enter the data here. . .
or here
 
2. Type the data in the cell.
 
 If you find typing in the Formula bar easier, click and start typing there. 
As soon as you type the first character, the Cancel button (an X) and 
Enter button (a check mark) appear beside the Insert Function button 
(labeled fx) on the Formula bar.

Book V
Chapter 1
Up and Running 
with Excel
447
Entering Data in a Worksheet
 
3. Press the Enter key to enter the number or label.
 
 Besides pressing the Enter key, you can also press an arrow key (←, 
↑, →, ↓), press Tab, or click the Enter button (the check mark) on the 
Formula bar.
 
 If you change your mind about entering data, click the Cancel button or 
press Esc to delete what you entered and start over.
Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains how to enter logical values and for-
mulas. The next several pages describe how to enter text labels, numeric 
values, date values, and time values.
 
The Paste Special command can come in very handy with worksheet data. 
As numbers are updated in the source file, they can be updated automati-
cally in an Excel worksheet as well. Consider linking worksheets if your 
adventures in Excel enable you to keep source data in one place. Book VIII, 
Chapter 7 explains linking files.
Entering text labels
Sometimes a text entry is too long to fit in a cell. How Excel accommodates 
text entries that are too wide depends on whether data is in the cell to the 
right of the one you entered the text in:
 
✦ If the cell to the right is empty, Excel lets the text spill into the next cell.
 
✦ If the cell to the right contains data, the entry gets cut off. Nevertheless, 
the text you entered is in the cell. Nothing gets lost when it can’t be 
displayed on-screen. You just can’t see the text or numbers except by 
glancing at the Formula bar, where the contents of the active cell can be 
seen in its entirety.
 
 To solve the problem of text that doesn’t fit in a cell, widen the column, 
shorten the text entry, reorient the text (Chapter 4 of this mini-book explains 
aligning numbers and text in columns and rows), or wrap the contents of the 
cell. Wrapping means to run the text down to the next line, much the way the 
text in a paragraph runs to the next line when it reaches the right margin. 
Excel makes rows taller to accommodate wrapped text in a cell. To wrap text 
in cells, select the cells, go to the Home tab, and click the Wrap Text button 
(you can find it in the Alignment group).
Entering numeric values
 
When a number is too large to fit in a cell, Excel displays pound signs (###) 
rather than a number, or it displays the number in scientific notation. You 
can always glance at the Formula bar, however, to find out the number in the 
active cell. As well, you can always widen the column to display the entire 
number.

448
Entering Data in a Worksheet
To enter a fraction in a cell, enter a 0 or a whole number, a blank space, and 
the fraction. For example, to enter 3⁄8, type a 0, press the spacebar, and type 
3/8. To enter 53⁄8, type the 5, press the spacebar, and type 3/8. For its pur-
poses, Excel converts fractions to decimal numbers, as you can see by look-
ing in the Formula bar after you enter a fraction. For example, 53⁄8 displays as 
5.375 in the Formula bar.
 
Here’s a little trick for quickly entering numbers with decimals in all the 
Excel files you work on. To spare yourself the trouble of pressing the period 
key (.), you can tell Excel to enter the period automatically. Instead of enter-
ing 12.45, for example, you can simply enter 1245. Excel enters the period for 
you: 12.45. To perform this trick, go to the File tab, choose Options, visit the 
Advanced category in the Excel Options dialog box, click the Automatically 
Insert a Decimal Point check box, and in the Places text box, enter the 
number of decimal places you want for numbers. Deselect this option when 
you want to go back to entering numbers the normal way.
Entering date and time values
Dates and times can be used in calculations, but entering a date or time 
value in a cell can be problematic because these values must be entered in 
such a way that Excel can recognize them as dates or times, not text.
 
Not that you need to know it especially, but Excel converts dates and times 
to serial values for the purpose of being able to use dates and times in cal-
culations. For example, July 31, 2004, is the number 38199. July 31, 2004, at 
noon is 38199.5. These serial values represent the number of whole days 
since January 1, 1900. The portion of the serial value to the right of the deci-
mal point is the time, represented as a portion of a full day.
Entering date values
You can enter a date value in a cell in just about any format you choose, and 
Excel understands that you’re entering a date. For example, enter a date in 
any of the following formats and you’ll be all right:
m/d/yy 
7/31/10
m-d-yyyy 
7-31-2010
d-mmm-yy 
31-Jul-10
Here are some basic things to remember about entering dates:
 
✦ Date formats: You can quickly apply a format to dates by selecting cells 
and using one of these techniques:
 
• On the Home tab, open the Number Format drop-down list and choose 
Short Date (m/d/yyyy; 7/31/2010) or Long Date (day-of-the-week, month, 
day, year; Saturday, July 31, 2010), as shown in Figure 1-5.

Book V
Chapter 1
Up and Running 
with Excel
449
Entering Data in a Worksheet
 
• On the Home tab, click the Number group button to open the 
Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box. As shown in Figure 1-5, 
choose the Date category and then choose a date format.
 
✦ Current date: Press Ctrl+; (semicolon) and press Enter to enter the cur-
rent date.
 
✦ Current year’s date: If you don’t enter the year as part of the date, Excel 
assumes that the date you entered is in the current year. For example, 
if you enter a date in the m/d (7/31) format during the year 2010, Excel 
enters the date as 7/31/10. As long as the date you want to enter is the 
current year, you can save a little time when entering dates by not enter-
ing the year, as Excel enters it for you.
 
✦ Dates on the Formula bar: No matter which format you use for dates, 
dates are displayed in the Formula bar in the format that Excel prefers 
for dates: m/d/yyyy (7/31/2010). How dates are displayed in the work-
sheet is up to you.
 
✦ 20th and 21st century two-digit years: When it comes to entering two-
digit years in dates, the digits 30 through 99 belong to the 20th century 
(1930–1999), but the digits 00 through 29 belong to the 21st century 
(2000–2029). For example, 7/31/10 refers to July 31, 2010, not July 31, 
1910. To enter a date in 1929 or earlier, enter four digits rather than two 
to describe the year: 7-31-1929. To enter a date in 2030 or later, enter 
four digits rather than two: 7-31-2030.

Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data with the AutoFill Command
 
✦ Dates in formulas: To enter a date directly in a formula, enclose the date 
in quotation marks. (Make sure that the cell where the formula is 
entered has been given the Number format, not the Date format.) For 
example, the formula =TODAY()-“1/1/2010” calculates the number of 
days that have elapsed since January 1, 2010. Formulas are the subject 
of Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
Entering time values
Excel recognizes time values that you enter in the following ways:
h:mm AM/PM 
3:31 AM
h:mm:ss AM/PM 
3:31:45 PM
Here are some things to remember when entering time values:
 
✦ Use colons: Separate hours, minutes, and seconds with a colon (:).
 
✦ Time formats: To change to the h:mm:ss AM/PM time format, select the 
cells, go to the Home tab, open the Number Format drop-down list, and 
choose Time (refer to Figure 1-5). You can also change time formats by 
clicking the Number group button on the Home tab and selecting a time 
format on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
 
✦ AM or PM time designations: Unless you enter AM or PM with the time, 
Excel assumes that you’re operating on military time. For example, 3:30 
is considered 3:30 a.m.; 15:30 is 3:30 p.m. Don’t enter periods after the 
letters am or pm (don’t enter a.m. or p.m.).
 
✦ Current time: Press Ctrl+Shift+; (semicolon) to enter the current time.
 
✦ Times on the Formula bar: On the Formula bar, times are displayed in 
this format: hours:minutes:seconds, followed by the letters AM or PM. 
However, the time format used in cells is up to you.
Combining date and time values
You can combine dates and time values by entering the date, a blank space, 
and the time:
 
✦ 7/31/10 3:31 am
 
✦ 7-31-10 3:31:45 pm
Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data 
with the AutoFill Command
Data that falls in the “serial” category — month names, days of the week, 
and consecutive numbers and dates, for example — can be entered quickly 

Book V
Chapter 1
Up and Running 
with Excel
451
Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data with the AutoFill Command
with the AutoFill command. Believe it or not, Excel recognizes certain kinds 
of serial data and enters it for you as part of the AutoFill feature. Instead of 
laboriously entering this data one piece at a time, you can enter it all at one 
time by dragging the mouse. Follow these steps to “autofill” cells:
 
1. Click the cell that is to be first in the series.
 
 For example, if you intend to list the days of the week in consecutive 
cells, click where the first day is to go.
 
2. Enter the first number, date, or list item in the series.
 
3. Move to the adjacent cell and enter the second number, date, or list 
item in the series.
 
 If you want to enter the same number or piece of text in adjacent cells, 
it isn’t necessary to take this step, but Excel needs the first and second 
items in the case of serial dates and numbers so that it can tell how 
much to increase or decrease the given amount or time period in each 
cell. For example, entering 5 and 10 tells Excel to increase the number 
by 5 each time so that the next serial entry is 15.
 
4. Select the cell or cells you just entered data in.
 
 To select a single cell, click it; to select two, drag over the cells. Chapter 
2 of this mini-book describes all the ways to select cells in a worksheet.
 
5. Click the AutoFill handle and start dragging in the direction in which 
you want the data series to appear on your worksheet.
 
 The AutoFill handle is the little black square in the lower-right corner 
of the cell or block of cells you selected. Finding it can be difficult. 
Carefully move the mouse pointer over the lower-right corner of the cell, 
and when you see the mouse pointer change into a black cross, click 
and start dragging. As you drag, the serial data appears in a pop-up box, 
as shown in Figure 1-6.

452
Quickly Entering Lists and Serial Data with the AutoFill Command
As you probably know, Excel is capable of com-
pleting lists on its own with the AutoFill feature. 
You can enter the days of the week or month 
names simply by entering one day or month 
and dragging the AutoFill handle to enter the 
others. Here’s some good news: The AutoFill 
command can also reproduce the names of 
your co-workers, the roster of a softball team, 
street names, or any other list that you care to 
enter quickly and repeatedly in a worksheet.
Follow these steps to enter items for a list so 
that you can enter them in the future by drag-
ging the AutoFill handle:
 1. If you’ve already entered items for the list 
on your worksheet, select the items.
 
 If you haven’t entered the items yet, skip to 
Step 2.
 2. On the File tab, choose Options to open the 
Excel Options dialog box.
 3. Select the Advanced category.
 4. Click the Edit Custom Lists button (you 
have to scroll down to find it).
 
 You see the Custom Lists dialog box.
 5. In the List Entries box, do one of the 
following:
 
 If you selected the items in Step 1, click 
the Import button. The items you selected 
appear in the List Entries box.
 
 If you need to enter items for the list, enter 
them in the List Entries box, with one item 
on each line.
 6. Click the Add button.
 7. Click OK.

Formatting Numbers, Dates, and Time Values
 
 The AutoFill Options button appears after you enter the serial data. Click it 
and choose an option if you want to copy cells or fill the cells without carry-
ing along their formats.
 
To enter the same number or text in several empty cells, drag over the cells 
to select them or select each cell by holding down the Ctrl key as you click. 
Then type a number or some text and press Ctrl+Enter.
Formatting Numbers, Dates, and Time Values
When you enter a number that Excel recognizes as belonging to one of its 
formats, Excel assigns the number format automatically. Enter 45%, for 
example, and Excel assigns the Percentage Style format. Enter $4.25, and 
Excel assigns the Currency Style format. Besides assigning formats by hand, 
however, you can assign them to cells from the get-go and spare yourself the 
trouble of entering dollar signs, commas, percent signs, and other extrane-
ous punctuation. All you have to do is enter the raw numbers. Excel does the 
window dressing for you.
Excel offers five number-formatting buttons on the Home tab — Accounting 
Number Format, Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase Decimal, and 
Decrease Decimal. Select cells with numbers in them and click one of these 
buttons to change how numbers are formatted:
 
 
✦ Accounting Number Format: Places a dollar sign before the number and 
gives it two decimal places. You can open the drop-down list on this 
button and choose a currency symbol apart from the dollar sign.
 
 
✦ Percent Style: Places a percent sign after the number and converts the 
number to a percentage.
 
 
✦ Comma Style: Places commas in the number.
 
 
✦ Increase Decimal: Increases the number of decimal places by one.
 
 
✦ Decrease Decimal: Decreases the number of decimal places by one.
To choose among many formats and to format dates and time values as 
well as numbers, go to the Home tab, click the Number group button, and 
make selections on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box. Figure 1-7 
shows this dialog box. Choose a category and select options to describe how 
you want numbers or text to appear.
 
 To strip formats from the data in cells, select the cells, go to the Home tab, 
click the Clear button, and choose Clear Formats.

Conditional Formats for Calling Attention to Data
 
Figure 1-7: 
The Number 
category of 
the Format 
Cells dialog 
box.
 
 
Entering ZIP Codes can be problematic because Excel strips the initial zero 
from the number if it begins with a zero. To get around that problem, visit 
the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure 1-7), choose 
Special in the Category list, and select a ZIP Code option.
Conditional Formats for Calling Attention to Data
A conditional format is one that applies when data meets certain conditions. 
To call attention to numbers greater than 10,000, for example, you can tell 
Excel to highlight those numbers automatically. To highlight negative num-
bers, you can tell Excel to display them in bright red. Conditional formats 
help you analyze and understand data better.
Select the cells that are candidates for conditional formatting and follow 
these steps to tell Excel when and how to format the cells:
 
 1. On the Home tab, click the Conditional Formatting button (you may 
have to click the Styles button first, depending on the size of your 
screen).
 
2. Choose Highlight Cells Rules or Top/Bottom Rules on the drop-down 
list.
 
 You see a submenu with choices about establishing the rule for whether 
values in the cells are highlighted or otherwise made more prominent:

Establishing Data-Validation Rules
 
• Highlight Cells Rules: These rules are for calling attention to data if 
it falls in a numerical or date range, or it’s greater or lesser than a 
specific value. For example, you can highlight cells that are greater 
than 400.
 
• Top/Bottom Rules: These rules are for calling attention to data if it 
falls within a percentage range relative to all the cells you selected. 
For example, you can highlight cells with data that falls in the bottom 
10 percent range.
 
3. Choose an option on the submenu.
 
 You see a dialog box similar to the ones in Figure 1-8.
 
Figure 1-8:

a condition 
format for 
data.
 
 
4. On the left side of the dialog box, establish the rule for flagging data.
 
5. On the With drop-down list, choose how you want to call attention to 
the data.
 
 For example, you can display the data in red or yellow. You can choose 
Custom Format on the drop-down list to open the Format Cells dialog 
box and choose a font style or color for the text.
 
6. Click OK.
To remove conditional formats, select the cells with the formats, go to the 
Home tab, click the Conditional Formatting button, and choose Clear Rules➪
Clear Rules from Selected Cells.
Establishing Data-Validation Rules
By nature, people are prone to enter data incorrectly because the task of 
entering data is so dull. This is why data-validation rules are invaluable. A 
data-validation rule is a rule concerning what kind of data can be entered in a 
cell. When you select a cell that has been given a rule, an input message tells 
you what to enter, as shown in Figure 1-9. And if you enter the data incor-
rectly, an error alert tells you as much, also shown in Figure 1-9.

Input message
Data-validation rules are an excellent defense against sloppy data entry and 
that itchy feeling you get when you’re in the middle of an irksome task. In a 
cell that records date entries, you can require dates to fall in a certain time 
frame. In a cell that records text entries, you can choose an item from a list 
instead of typing it yourself. In a cell that records numeric entries, you can 
require the number to fall within a certain range. Table 1-1 describes the dif-
ferent categories of data-validation rules.
Table 1-1 
Data-Validation Rule Categories
Rule
What Can Be Entered
Any Value
Anything whatsoever. This is the default setting.
Whole 
Number
Whole numbers (no decimal points allowed). Choose an operator 
from the Data drop-down list and values to describe the range of 
numbers that can be entered.
Decimal
Same as the Whole Number rule except numbers with decimal 
points are permitted.

Follow these steps to establish a data-validation rule:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that need a rule.
 
 2. On the Data tab, click the Data Validation button.
 
 As shown in Figure 1-10, you see the Settings tab of the Data Validation 
dialog box.
 
3. On the Allow drop-down list, choose the category of rule you want.
 
 Table 1-1, earlier in this chapter, describes these categories.

4. Enter the criteria for the rule.
 
 What the criteria is depends on what rule category you’re working in. 
Table 1-1 describes how to enter the criteria for rules in each category. 
You can refer to cells in the worksheet by selecting them. To do that, 
either select them directly or click the Range Selector button and then 
select them.
 
5. On the Input Message tab, enter a title and input message.
 
 You can see a title (“Quit Sluffing Off”) and input message (“Enter a 
number between 24,000 and 32,000”) in Figure 1-9. The title appears in 
boldface. Briefly describe what kind of data belongs in the cell or cells 
you selected.
 
6. On the Error Alert tab, choose a style for the symbol in the Message 
Alert dialog box, enter a title for the dialog box, and enter a warning 
message.
 
 In the error message in Figure 1-9, the Stop symbol was chosen. The title 
you enter appears across the top of the dialog box, and the message 
appears beside the symbol.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 To remove data-validation rules from cells, select the cells, go to the 
Data tab, click the Data Validation button, and on the Settings tab of the 
Data Validation dialog box, click the Clear All button, and click OK.

T
his chapter delves into the workaday world of worksheets (say that 
three times fast). It explains how to edit worksheet data and move 
quickly here and there in a worksheet. You also discover a couple of tech-
niques for entering data quickly, how to select cells, and how to copy and 
move data in cells. This chapter describes how to move, delete, and rename 
worksheets, as well as protect them from being edited or altered.
Editing Worksheet Data
Not everyone enters data correctly the first time. To edit data you entered 
in a cell, do one of the following:
 
✦ Double-click the cell. Doing so places the cursor squarely in the cell, 
where you can start deleting or entering numbers and text.
 
✦ Click the cell and press F2. This technique also lands the cursor in the 
cell.
 
✦ Click the cell you want to edit. With this technique, you edit the data 
on the Formula bar.
 
If nothing happens when you double-click, or if pressing F2 lands the cursor 
in the Formula bar, not a cell, somebody has been fooling with the Options 
settings. On the File tab, choose Options, select the Advanced category in 
the Excel Options dialog box, and click the Allow Editing Directly in Cells 
check box.

Moving Around in a Worksheet
Moving Around in a Worksheet
Going from place to place gets progressively more difficult as a worksheet 
gets larger. Luckily for you, Excel offers keyboard shortcuts for jumping 
around. Table 2-1 describes these keyboard shortcuts.

ent areas. Drag the scroll box to cover long distances. To cover long dis-
tances very quickly, hold down the Shift key as you drag the scroll box 
on the vertical scroll bar.
 
✦ Scroll wheel on the mouse: If your mouse is equipped with a scroll 
wheel, turn the wheel to quickly scroll up and down.
 
✦ Name box: Enter a cell address in the Name box and press Enter to go to 
the cell. The Name box is found to the left of the Formula bar.
 
 
✦ The Go To command: On the Home tab, click the Find & Select button, 
and choose Go To on the drop-down list (or press Ctrl+G or F5). You see 
the Go To dialog box. Enter a cell address in the Reference box and click 
OK. Cell addresses you’ve already visited with the Go To command are 
already listed in the dialog box. Click the Special button to open the Go To 
Special dialog box and visit a formula, comment, or other esoteric item.
 
✦ The Find command: On the Home tab, click the Find & Select button, 
and choose Find on the drop-down list (or press Ctrl+F). Enter the data 
you seek in the Find What box and click the Find Next button. Click the

To scroll to the active cell if you no longer see it on-screen, press 
Ctrl+Backspace.
Getting a Better Look at the Worksheet
Especially when you’re entering data, it pays to get a good look at the work-
sheet. You need to know which column and row you’re entering data in. 
These pages explain techniques for changing your view of a worksheet so 
that you always know where you are. Read on to discover how to freeze, 
split, and hide columns and rows. (On the subject of changing views, Book 
I, Chapter 3 explains an essential technique for changing views: zooming in 
and zooming out.)
Freezing and splitting columns and rows
Sometimes your adventures in a worksheet take you to a faraway cell 
address, such as X31 or C39. Out there in the wilderness, it’s hard to tell 
where to enter data because you can’t see the data labels in the first column 
or first row that tell you where to enter data on the worksheet.
To see one part of a worksheet no matter how far you stray from it, you can 
split the worksheet or freeze columns and rows on-screen. In Figure 2-1, I 
split the worksheet so that column A (Property) always appears on-screen, 
no matter how far I scroll to the right; similarly, row 1 (Property, Rent, 
Management Fees, and so on) also appears at the top of the worksheet no 
matter how far I scroll down. Notice how the row numbers and column let-
ters are interrupted in Figure 2-1. Because I split the screen, I always know 
what data to enter in a cell because I can clearly see property names in the 
first column and the column headings along the top of the worksheet.
Freezing columns or rows on a worksheet works much like splitting except 
that lines instead of gray bars appear on-screen to show which columns and 
rows are frozen, and you can’t adjust where the split occurs by dragging the 
boundary where the worksheet is split.
 
Splitting the worksheet is superior to freezing columns or rows because, for 
one, you can drag the split lines to new locations when you split the work-
sheet, and moreover, you can remove a horizontal or vertical split simply by 
double-clicking it. However, if your goal is simply to freeze the topmost row 
or leftmost column in your worksheet, use a Freeze Panes command because 
all you have to do is go to the View tab, click the Freeze Panes button, and 
choose Freeze Top Row or Freeze First Column.

Giving the Split or Freeze Panes command
Follow these steps to split or freeze columns and rows on-screen:
 
1. Click the cell directly below the row you want to freeze or split, and 
click in the column to the right of the column that you want to freeze 
or split.
 
 In other words, click where you want the split to occur.
 
2. On the View tab, split or freeze the columns and rows.
 
 Go to the View tab and use one of these techniques:
 
 
• Splitting: Click the Split button and then click and drag the split bars 
to split the screen horizontally or vertically. The other way to split a 
worksheet is to grab hold of a split bar, the little division markers 
directly above the vertical scroll bar and directly to the right of the 
horizontal scroll bar (in the lower-right corner of your screen). You 
can tell where split bars are because the pointer turns into a double 
arrow when it’s over a split bar.
 
 
• Freezing: Click the Freeze Panes button and choose one of three 
Freeze options on the drop-down list. The second and third options, 
respectively, freeze the top row or first column. The first option, 
Freeze Panes, freezes the column(s) to the left and the row(s) above 
the cell you selected in Step 1.
 
 Bars or lines appear on-screen to show which row(s) and column(s) 
have been frozen or split. Move where you will in the worksheet. The 
column(s) and row(s) you froze or split stay on-screen.

Unsplitting and unfreezing
Use one of these techniques to keep your worksheet from splitting or freez-
ing to death:
 
✦ Unsplitting: Click the Split button again; double-click one of the split 
bars to remove it; or drag a split bar into the top or left side of the work-
sheet window.
 
✦ Unfreezing: On the View tab, click the Freeze Panes button and choose 
Unfreeze Panes on the drop-down list.
Hiding columns and rows
Another way to take the clutter out of a worksheet is to temporarily hide col-
umns and rows:
After you go to the trouble of freezing the 
screen or zooming in to a position you’re com-
fortable with, you may as well save your view 
of the screen as a customized view. That way, 
you can call upon the customized view when-
ever you need it. View settings, the window 
size, the position of the grid on-screen, and 
cells that are selected can all be saved in a 
customized view.
Follow these steps to create a customized 
view:
1. On the View tab, click the Custom Views 
button.
 
 You see the Custom Views dialog box. It 
lists views you’ve already created, if you’ve 
created any.
 2. Click the Add button.
 
 The Add View dialog box appears.
 3. Enter a name for the view and click OK.
To switch to a customized view, click the 
Custom Views button, select a view in the 
Custom Views dialog box, and click the Show 
button.

Comments for Documenting Your Worksheet
 
 
✦ Hiding columns or rows: Drag over the column letters or row numbers of 
the columns or rows that you want to hide. Dragging this way selects 
entire columns or rows. Then go to the Home tab, click the Format button, 
choose Hide & Unhide, and choose Hide Columns or Hide Rows.
 
✦ Unhiding columns and rows: Select columns to the right and left of the 
hidden columns, or select rows above and below the hidden rows. To 
select columns or rows, drag over their letters or numbers. Then go 
to the Home tab, click the Format button, choose Hide & Unhide, and 
choose Unhide Columns or Unhide Rows.
 
It’s easy to forget where you hid columns or rows. To make sure that all col-
umns and rows in your worksheet are displayed, click the Select All button 
(or press Ctrl+A) to select your entire worksheet. Then go to the Home tab, 
click the Format button and choose Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Columns; click 
the Format button again and choose Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows.
Comments for Documenting Your Worksheet
It may happen that you return to your worksheet days or months from now 
and discover to your dismay that you don’t know why certain numbers or 
formulas are there. For that matter, someone else may inherit your work-
sheet and be mystified as to what the heck is going on. To take the mystery 
out of a worksheet, document it by entering comments here and there.
A comment is a note that describes part of a worksheet. Each comment is 
connected to a cell. You can tell where a comment is because a small red tri-
angle appears in the upper-right corner of cells that have been commented 
on. Move the pointer over one of these triangles and you see the pop-up 
box, a comment, and the name of the person who entered the comment, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. Click the Show All Comments button on the Review tab 
to see every comment in a worksheet.
Here’s everything a mere mortal needs to know about comments:
 
 
✦ Entering a comment: Click the cell that deserves the comment, go to the 
Review tab, and click the New Comment button. Enter your comment in 
the pop-up box. Click in a different cell when you finish entering your 
comment.
 
✦ Reading a comment: Move the pointer over the small red triangle and 
read the comment in the pop-up box (refer to Figure 2-2).
 
✦ Finding comments: On the Review tab, click the Previous or Next button 
to go from comment to comment.
 
 
✦ Editing a comment: On the Review tab, select the cell with the com-
ment, click the Edit Comment button, and edit the comment in the 
pop-up box. You can also right-click the cell and choose Edit Comment.

Ctrl+clicking and then click the Delete button.
 
✦ Deleting all comments in a worksheet: Select all comments and then, 
on the Review tab, click the Delete button. You can select all comments 
by clicking the Find & Select button on the Home tab, choosing Go To, 
and in the Go To dialog box, clicking the Special button and choosing 
Comments in the Go To Special dialog box.
 
If your name doesn’t appear in the pop-up box after you enter a comment 
and you want it to appear there, go to the File tab, choose Options, select 
the General category in the Excel Options dialog box, and enter your name in 
the User Name text box.
You can print the comments in a worksheet. On the Page Layout tab, click 
the Page Setup group button, and on the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog 
box, open the Comments drop-down list and choose At End of Sheet or As 
Displayed on Sheet.
Selecting Cells in a Worksheet
To format, copy, move, delete, and format numbers and words in a work-
sheet, you have to select the cells in which the numbers and words are 
found. Here are ways to select cells and the data inside them:
 
✦ A block of cells: Drag diagonally across the worksheet from one corner 
of the block of cells to the opposite corner. You can also click in one 
corner and Shift+click the opposite corner.

466
Deleting, Copying, and Moving Data
 
✦ Adjacent cells in a row or column: Drag across the cells.
 
✦ Cells in various places: While holding down the Ctrl key, click different 
cells.
 
✦ A row or rows: Click a row number to select an entire row. Click and 
drag down the row numbers to select several adjacent rows.
 
✦ A column or columns: Click a column letter to select an entire column. 
Click and drag across letters to select adjacent columns.
 
 
✦ Entire worksheet: Click the Select All button, the square to the left of 
the column letters and above the row numbers; press Ctrl+A; or press 
Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar.
 
Press Ctrl+Spacebar to select the column that the active cell is in; press 
Shift+Spacebar to select the row where the active cell is.
You can enter the same data item in several different cells by selecting cells 
and then entering the data in one cell and pressing Ctrl+Enter. This tech-
nique comes in very handy, for example, when you want to enter a place-
holder zero (0) in several different cells.
Deleting, Copying, and Moving Data
In the course of putting together a worksheet, it is sometimes necessary to 
delete, copy, and move cell contents. Here are instructions for doing these 
chores:
 
 
✦ Deleting cell contents: Select the cells and then press the Delete key; on 
the Home tab, click the Clear button and choose Clear Contents; or 
right-click and choose Clear Contents. (Avoid the Delete button on the 
Home tab for deleting cell contents. Clicking that button deletes cells as 
well as their contents.)
 
✦ Copying and moving cell contents: Select the cells and use one of these 
techniques:
 
 
• Cut or Copy and Paste commands: When you paste the data, click 
where you want the first cell of the block of cells you’re copying or 
moving to go. (Book I, Chapter 2 explains copying and moving data in 
detail.) Be careful not to overwrite cells with data in them when you 
copy or move data. After you paste data, you see the Paste Options 
button. Click this button and choose an option from the drop-down 
list to format the data in different ways.
 
• Drag and drop: Move the pointer to the edge of the cell block, click 
when you see the four-headed arrow, and start dragging. Hold down 
the Ctrl key to copy the data.

Handling the Worksheets in a Workbook
Handling the Worksheets in a Workbook
As a glance at the bottom of the worksheet tells you, each workbook comes 
with three worksheets named (not very creatively) Sheet1, Sheet2, and 
Sheet3. Follow these instructions to move among, add, delete, rename, and 
change the order of worksheets:
 
✦ Moving among worksheets: To go from one worksheet to another, click 
a worksheet tab along the bottom of the screen. If you can’t see a tab, 
click one of the scroll arrows to the left of the worksheet tabs.
 
✦ Renaming a worksheet: Right-click the worksheet tab, choose Rename 
on the shortcut menu, type a new name, and press Enter. You can also 
go to the Home tab, click the Format button, choose Rename Sheet on 
the drop-down list, and enter a new name. Spaces are allowed in names, 
and names can be 31 characters long. Brackets ([]) are allowed in 
names, but you can’t use these symbols: / \ : ? and *.
 
✦ Selecting worksheets: Click the worksheet’s tab to select it. To select 
several worksheets, Ctrl+click their tabs or click the first tab and then 
Shift+click the last tab in the set. To select all the worksheets, right-click 
a tab and choose Select All Sheets on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Rearranging worksheets: Drag the worksheet tab to a new location. As 
you drag, a tiny black arrow and a page icon appear to show you where 
the worksheet will land after you release the mouse button. You can also 
select a sheet, go to the Home tab, click the Format button, and choose 
Move or Copy Sheet on the drop-down list. The Move or Copy dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. Select the sheet in the Before Sheet list 
where you want the worksheet to go and click OK.
 
 
✦ Inserting a new worksheet: Click the Insert Sheet button (you can find it 
to the right of the worksheet tabs); press Shift+F11; or on the Home tab, 
open the drop-down list on the Insert button and choose Insert Sheet.

Keeping Others from Tampering with Worksheets
 
 
✦ Deleting a worksheet: Select the sheet, and on the Home tab, open the 
drop-down list on the Delete button and choose Delete Sheet. You can 
also right-click a worksheet tab and choose Delete. Be careful because 
you can’t restore your deleted worksheet by pressing the Undo button.
 
✦ Copying a worksheet: Select the sheet, hold down the Ctrl key, and drag 
the worksheet tab to a new location.
 
✦ Color-coding a worksheet: Right-click a worksheet tab and choose Tab 
Color. Then select a color in the submenu, or choose More Colors and 
select a color in the Colors dialog box. You can also select a worksheet 
tab, go to the Home tab, click the Format button, choose Tab Color on 
the drop-down list, and choose a color on the submenu.
 
You can change the size of columns or apply numeric formats to the same 
addresses in different worksheets by selecting all the sheets first and then 
formatting one worksheet. The formats apply to all the worksheets that you 
select. Being able to format several different worksheets simultaneously 
comes in handy, for example, when your workbook tracks monthly data and 
each worksheet pertains to one month. Another way to handle worksheets 
with similar data is to create the first worksheet and copy it to the second, 
third, and fourth worksheets with the Copy and Paste commands.
Keeping Others from Tampering with Worksheets
People with savvy and foresight sometimes set up workbooks so that one 
worksheet holds raw data and the other worksheets hold formulas that cal-
culate the raw data. This technique prevents others from tampering with the 
raw data. Furthermore, if the worksheet with raw data is hidden, the chance 
it will be tampered with is lower; and if the worksheet is protected, no one 
can tamper with it unless they have a password. These pages explain how to 
hide a worksheet so that others are less likely to find it and how to protect a 
worksheet from being edited.
Hiding a worksheet
Follow these instructions to hide and unhide worksheets:
 
 
✦ Hiding a worksheet: Select the worksheet you want to hide, go to the 
View tab, and click the Hide button. You can also right-click the work-
sheet’s tab and choose Hide on the shortcut menu. And you can also dis-

Keeping Others from Tampering with Worksheets
Protecting a worksheet
Protecting a worksheet means to restrict others from changing it — from for-
matting it, inserting new rows and columns, or deleting rows and columns, 
among other tasks. You can also prevent any editorial changes whatsoever 
from being made to a worksheet. Follow these steps to protect a worksheet 
from tampering by others:
 
1. Select the worksheet that needs protection.
 
 2. On the Review tab, click the Protect Sheet button.
 
 You see the Protect Sheet dialog box shown in Figure 2-4. You can also 
open this dialog box by going to the Home tab, clicking the Format 
button, and choosing Protect Sheet.
 
3. Enter a password in the Password to Unprotect Sheet box if you want 
only people with the password to be able to unprotect the worksheet 
after you protect it.
 
4. On the Allow All Users of This Worksheet To list, select the check box 
next to the name of each task that you want to permit others to do.
 
 For example, click the Format Cells check box if you want others to be 
able to format cells.
 
 Deselect the Select Locked Cells check box to prevent any changes from 
being made to the worksheet. By default, all worksheet cells are locked, 
and by preventing others from selecting locked cells, you effectively pre-
vent them from editing any cells.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 If you entered a password in Step 3, you must enter it again in the 
Confirm Password dialog box and click OK.

F
ormulas are where it’s at as far as Excel is concerned. After you know 
how to construct formulas, and constructing them is pretty easy, you 
can put Excel to work. You can make the numbers speak to you. You can 
turn a bunch of unruly numbers into meaningful figures and statistics.
This chapter explains what a formula is, how to enter a formula, and how to 
enter a formula quickly. You also discover how to copy formulas from cell 
to cell and how to keep formula errors from creeping into your workbooks. 
Finally, this chapter explains how to make use of the hundred or so func-
tions that Excel offers.
How Formulas Work
A formula, you may recall from the sleepy hours you spent in math class, 
is a way to calculate numbers. For example, 2+3=5 is a formula. When you 
enter a formula in a cell, Excel computes the formula and displays its results 
in the cell. Click in cell A3 and enter =2+3, for example, and Excel displays 
the number 5 in cell A3.
Referring to cells in formulas
As well as numbers, Excel formulas can refer to the contents of different 
cells. When a formula refers to a cell, the number in the cell is used to com-
pute the formula. In Figure 3-1, for example, cell A1 contains the number 2; 
cell A2 contains the number 3; and cell A3 contains the formula =A1+A2. As 

472
How Formulas Work
shown in cell A3, the result of the formula is 5. If I change the number in cell 
A1 from 2 to 3, the result of the formula in cell A3 (=A1+A2) becomes 6, not 
5. When a formula refers to a cell and the number in the cell changes, the 
result of the formula changes as well.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A simple 
formula.
 
Formula in the formula bar
Results of the formula
To see the value of using cell references in formulas, consider the worksheet 
shown in Figure 3-2. The purpose of this worksheet is to track the budget of 
a school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA):
 
Figure 3-2: 
Using 
formulas 
in a 
worksheet.
 
 
✦ Column C, Actual Income, lists income from different sources.
 
✦ Column D, Projected Income, shows what the PTA members thought 
income from these sources would be.
 
✦ Column E, Over/Under Budget, shows how actual income compares to 
projected income from the different sources.

Book V
Chapter 3

Functions for 
Crunching Numbers
473
How Formulas Work
As the figures in the Actual Income column (column C) are updated, figures 
in the Over/Under Budget column (column E) and the Total Income row (row 
8) change instantaneously. These figures change instantaneously because 
the formulas refer to the numbers in cells, not to unchanging numbers 
(known as constants).
Figure 3-3 shows the formulas used to calculate the data in the worksheet in 
Figure 3-2. In column E, formulas deduct the numbers in column D from the 
numbers in column C to show where the PTA over- or underbudgeted for the 
different sources of income. In row 8, you can see how the SUM function is 
used to total cells in rows 3 through 7. The end of this chapter explains how 
to use functions in formulas.
 
Figure 3-3: 
The 
formulas 
used to 
generate 
the numbers 
in Figure 
3-2.
 
 
Excel is remarkably good about updating cell references in formulas when 
you move cells. To see how good Excel is, consider what happens to cell 
addresses in formulas when you delete a row in a worksheet. If a formula 
refers to cell C1 but you delete row B, row C becomes row B, and the value 
in cell C1 changes addresses from C1 to B1. You would think that references 
in formulas to cell C1 would be out of date, but you would be wrong. Excel 
automatically adjusts all formulas that refer to cell C1. Those formulas now 
refer to cell B1 instead.
 
 In case you want to know, you can display formulas in worksheet cells instead 
of the results of formulas, as was done in Figure 3-3, by pressing Ctrl+’ or click-
ing the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab (you may have to click the 
Formula Auditing button first, depending on the size of your screen). Click the 
Show Formulas button a second time to see formula results again.
Referring to formula results in formulas
Besides referring to cells with numbers in them, you can refer to formula 
results in a cell. Consider the worksheet shown in Figure 3-4. The purpose of 
this worksheet is to track scoring by the players on a basketball team over 
three games:

474
How Formulas Work
 
Figure 3-4: 
Using 
formula 
results 
as other 
formulas.
 
 
✦ The Totals column (column E) shows the total points each player scored 
in the three games.
 
✦ The Average column (column F), using the formula results in the Totals 
column, determines how much each player has scored on average. The 
Average column does that by dividing the results in column E by 3, the 
number of games played.
In this case, Excel uses the results of the total-calculation formulas in 
column E to compute average points per game in column F.
Operators in formulas
Addition, subtraction, and division aren’t the only operators you can use in 
formulas. Table 3-1 explains the arithmetic operators you can use and the 
key you press to enter each operator. In the table, operators are listed in the 
order of precedence.

The Basics of Entering a Formula
Another way to compute a formula is to make use of a function. As “Working 
with Functions” explains later in this chapter, a function is a built-in formula 
that comes with Excel. SUM, for example, adds the numbers in cells. AVG 
finds the average of different numbers.
The Basics of Entering a Formula
No matter what kind of formula you enter, no matter how complex the for-
mula is, follow these basic steps to enter it:
 
1. Click the cell where you want to enter the formula.
 
2. Click in the Formula bar if you want to enter the data there rather 
than in the cell.
 
3. Enter the equals sign (=).
 
 You must be sure to enter the equals sign before you enter a formula. 
Without it, Excel thinks you’re entering text or a number, not a formula.
 
4. Enter the formula.
 
 For example, enter =B1*.06. Make sure that you enter all cell addresses 
correctly. By the way, you can enter lowercase letters in cell references. 
Excel changes them to uppercase after you finish entering the formula. 
The next section in this chapter explains how to quickly enter cell 
addresses in formulas.
When a formula includes more than one opera-
tor, the order in which the operators appear in 
the formula matters a lot. Consider this formula:
=2+3*4
Does this formula result in 14 (2+[3*4]) or 20 
([2+3]*4)? The answer is 14 because Excel 
performs multiplication before addition in 
formulas. In other words, multiplication 
takes precedence over addition. The order in 
which calculations are made in a formula that 
includes different operators is called the order 
of precedence. Be sure to remember the order 
of precedence when you construct complex 
formulas with more than one operator:
 1. Percent (%)
 2. Exponentiation (^)
 3. Multiplication (*) and division (/); leftmost 
operations are calculated first
 4. Addition (+) and subtraction (-); leftmost 
operations are calculated first
 5. Concatenation (&)
 6. Comparison (<, <=, >,>=, and <>)
To get around the order of precedence prob-
lem, enclose parts of formulas in parentheses. 
Operations in parentheses are calculated 
before all other parts of a formula. For example, 
the formula =2+3*4 equals 20 when it is written 
this way: =(2+3)*4.

 5. Press Enter or click the Enter button (the check mark on the 
Formula bar).
 
 The result of the formula appears in the cell.
Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
Entering formulas and making sure that all cell references are correct is a 
tedious activity, but fortunately for you, Excel offers a few techniques to 
make entering formulas easier. Read on to find out how ranges make entering 
cell references easier and how you can enter cell references in formulas by 
pointing and clicking. You also find instructions here for copying formulas.
Clicking cells to enter cell references
The hardest part about entering a formula is entering the cell references cor-
rectly. You have to squint to see which row and column the cell you want 
to refer to is in. You have to carefully type the right column letter and row 
number. However, instead of typing a cell reference, you can click the cell 
you want to refer to in a formula.
In the course of entering a formula, simply click the cell on your worksheet 
that you want to reference. As shown in Figure 3-5, shimmering marquee 
lights appear around the cell that you clicked so that you can clearly see 
which cell you’re referring to. The cell’s reference address, meanwhile, 
appears in the Formula bar. In Figure 3-5, I clicked cell F3 instead of entering 
its reference address on the Formula bar. The reference F3 appears on the 
Formula bar, and the marquee lights appear around cell F3.
Get in the habit of pointing and clicking cells to enter cell references in for-
mulas. Clicking cells is easier than typing cell addresses, and the cell refer-
ences are entered more accurately.

Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
Entering a cell range
A cell range is a line or block of cells in a worksheet. Instead of typing cell 
reference addresses one at a time, you can simply select cells on your 
worksheet. In Figure 3-6, I selected cells C3, D3, E3, and F3 to form cell range 
C3:F3. This spares me the trouble of entering the cell addresses one at a 
time: C3, D3, E3, and F3. The formula in Figure 3-6 uses the SUM function 
to total the numeric values in cell range C3:F3. Notice the marquee lights 
around the range C3:F3. The lights show precisely which range you’re select-
ing. Cell ranges come in especially handy where functions are concerned 
(see “Working with Functions” later in this chapter).
 
Figure 3-6: 
Using a cell 
range in a 
formula.
 
Cell range
Select cells to enter a range
To identify a cell range, Excel lists the outermost cells in the range and 
places a colon (:) between cell addresses:
 
✦ A cell range comprising cells A1, A2, A3, and A4 is listed this way: A1:A4.
 
✦ A cell range comprising a block of cells from A1 to D4 is listed this way: 
A1:D4.
You can enter cell ranges on your own without selecting cells. To do so, type 
the first cell in the range, enter a colon, and type the last cell.
Naming cell ranges so that you 
can use them in formulas
Whether you type cell addresses yourself or drag across cells to enter a cell 
range, entering cell address references is a chore. Entering =C1+C2+C3+C4, 
for example, can cause a finger cramp; entering =SUM(C1:C4) is no piece of 
cake, either. To take the tedium out of entering cell ranges in formulas, you 
can name cell ranges. Then, to enter a cell range in a formula, all you have to

do is select a name in the Paste Name dialog box or click the Use in Formula 
button on the Formulas tab, as shown in Figure 3-7. Naming cell ranges has an 
added benefit: You can choose a name from the Name Box drop-down list and 
go directly to the cell range whose name you choose, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
Figure 3-7:

Enter a named cell range in a formula
 
Naming cell ranges has one disadvantage, and it’s a big one. Excel doesn’t 
adjust cell references when you copy a formula with a range name from one 
cell to another. A range name always refers to the same set of cells. Later 
in this chapter, “Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell” explains how to copy 
formulas.
Creating a cell range name
Follow these steps to create a cell range name:
 
1. Select the cells that you want to name.
 
 2. On the Formulas tab, click the Define Name button.
 
 You see the New Name dialog box.
 
3. Enter a descriptive name in the Name box.
 
 Names can’t begin with a number or include blank spaces.
 
4. On the Scope drop-down list, choose Workbook or a worksheet name.

480
Speed Techniques for Entering Formulas
 
 Choose a worksheet name if you intend to use the range name you’re 
creating only in formulas that you construct in a single worksheet. If 
your formulas will refer to cell range addresses in different worksheets, 
choose Workbook so that you can use the range name wherever you go 
in your workbook.
 
5. Enter a comment to describe the range name, if you want.
 
 Enter a comment if doing so will help you remember where the cells 
you’re naming are located or what type of information they hold. As I 
explain shortly, you can read comments in the Name Manager dialog 
box, the place where you go to edit and delete range names.
 
6. Click OK.
 
In case you’re in a hurry, here’s a fast way to enter a cell range name: 
Select the cells for the range, click in the Name Box (which you find to the 
left of the Formula bar; refer to Figure 3-7), enter a name for the range, and 
press the Enter key.
Entering a range name as part of a formula
To include a cell range name in a formula, click in the Formula bar where 
you want to enter the range name and then use one of these techniques to 
enter the name:
 
 ✦ On the Formulas tab, click the Use in Formula button and choose a cell 
range name on the drop-down list (refer to Figure 3-7).
 
✦ Press F3 or click the Use in Formula button and choose Paste Names on 
the drop-down list. You see the Paste Name dialog box (refer to Figure 
3-7). Select a cell range name and click OK.
Quickly traveling to a cell range that you named
To go quickly to a cell range you named, open the drop-down list on the 
Name Box and choose a name (refer to Figure 3-7). The Name Box drop-
down list is located to the left of the Formula bar.
To make this trick work, the cursor can’t be in the Formula bar. The Name 
Box drop-down list isn’t available when you’re constructing a formula.
Managing cell range names
 
 To rename, edit, or delete cell range names, go to the Formulas tab and click 
the Name Manager button. You see the Name Manager dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 3-8. This dialog box lists names, cell values in names, the worksheet 
on which the range name is found, and whether the range name can be 
applied throughout a workbook or only in one worksheet. To rename, edit, or 
delete a cell range name, select it in the dialog box and use these techniques:

✦ Renaming: Click the Edit button and enter a new name in the Edit Name 
dialog box.
 
✦ Reassigning cells: To assign different cells to a range name, click the Edit 
button. You see the Edit Name dialog box. To enter a new range of cells, 
either enter the cells’ addresses in the Refers To text box or click the 
Range Selector button (it’s to the right of the text box), drag across the 
cells on your worksheet that you want for the cell range, and click the Cell 
Selector button again to return to the Edit Name dialog box.
 
✦ Deleting: Click the Delete button and click OK in the confirmation box.
 
Figure 3-8: 
The Name

Referring to cells in different worksheets
Excel gives you the opportunity to use data from different worksheets in a 
formula. If one worksheet lists sales figures from January and the next lists 
sales figures from February, you can construct a “grand total” formula in 
either worksheet to tabulate sales in the two-month period. A reference to a 
cell on a different worksheet is called a 3D reference.
Construct the formula as you normally would, but when you want to refer 
to a cell or cell range in a different worksheet, click a worksheet tab to move 
to the other worksheet and select the cell or range of cells there. Without 
returning to the original worksheet, complete your formula in the Formula 
bar and press Enter. Excel returns you to the original worksheet, where you 
can see the results of your formula.

482
Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell
 
The only thing odd about constructing formulas across worksheets are the 
cell references. As a glance at the Formula bar tells you, cell addresses in 
cross-worksheet formulas list the sheet name and an exclamation point (!) as 
well as the cell address itself. For example, this formula in Worksheet 1 adds 
the number in cell A4 to the numbers in cells D5 and E5 in Worksheet 2:
=A4+Sheet2!D5+Sheet2!E5
This formula in Sheet 2 multiplies the number in cell E18 by the number in 
cell C15 in Worksheet 1:
=E18*Sheet1!C15
This formula in Worksheet 2 finds the average of the numbers in the cell 
range C7:F7 in Worksheet 1:
=AVERAGE(Sheet1!C7:F7)
Copying Formulas from Cell to Cell
Often in worksheets, the same formula but with different cell references is 
used across a row or down a column. For example, in the worksheet shown 
in Figure 3-9, column F totals the rainfall figures in rows 7 through 11. To 
enter formulas for totaling the rainfall figures in column F, you could labori-
ously enter formulas in cells F7, F8, F9, F10, and F11. But a faster way is to 
enter the formula once in cell F7 and then copy the formula in F7 down the 
column to cells F8, F9, F10, and F11.
 
When you copy a formula to a new cell, Excel adjusts the cell references in 
the formula so that the formula works in the cells to which it has been 
copied. Astounding! Opportunities to copy formulas abound on most work-
sheets. And copying formulas is the fastest and safest way to enter formulas 
in a worksheet.
Follow these steps to copy a formula:
 
1. Select the cell with the formula you want to copy down a column or 
across a row.
 
2. Drag the AutoFill handle across the cells to which you want to copy 
the formula.
 
 This is the same AutoFill handle you drag to enter serial data (see 
Chapter 1 of this mini-book about entering lists and serial data with the 
AutoFill command). The AutoFill handle is the small black square in the 
lower-right corner of the cell. When you move the mouse pointer over it, 
it changes to a black cross. Figure 3-9 shows a formula being copied.

3. Release the mouse button.
 
 If I were you, I would click in the cells to which you copied the formula 
and glance at the Formula bar to make sure that the formula was copied 
correctly. I’d bet you it was.
You can also copy formulas with the Copy and Paste commands. Just make 
sure that cell references refer correctly to the surrounding cells.

Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
It happens. Everyone makes an error from time to time when entering formu-
las in cells. Especially in a worksheet in which formula results are calculated 
into other formulas, a single error in one formula can spread like a virus and 
cause miscalculations throughout a worksheet. To prevent that from hap-
pening, Excel offers several ways to correct errors in formulas. You can cor-
rect them one at a time, run the error checker, and trace cell references, as 
the following pages explain.
 
 By the way, if you want to see formulas in cells rather than formula results, 
go to the Formulas tab and click the Show Formulas button (or press Ctrl+’). 
Sometimes seeing formulas this way helps to detect formula errors.

484
Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
Correcting errors one at a time
When Excel detects what it thinks is a formula that has been entered incor-
rectly, a small green triangle appears in the upper-left corner of the cell 
where you entered the formula. And if the error is especially egregious, an 
error message, a cryptic three or four letters preceded by a pound sign (#), 
appears in the cell. Table 3-2 explains common error messages.
Table 3-2 
Common Formula Error Messages
Message
What Went Wrong
#DIV/0!
You tried to divide a number by a zero (0) or an empty cell.
#NAME
You used a cell range name in the formula, but the name isn’t 
defined. Sometimes this error occurs because you type the name 
incorrectly. (Earlier in this chapter, “Naming cell ranges so that 
you can use them in formulas” explains how to name cell ranges.)
#N/A
The formula refers to an empty cell, so no data is available for 
computing the formula. Sometimes people enter N/A in a cell as a 
placeholder to signal the fact that data isn’t entered yet. Revise the 
formula or enter a number or formula in the empty cells.
#NULL
The formula refers to a cell range that Excel can’t understand. 
Make sure that the range is entered correctly.
#NUM
An argument you use in your formula is invalid.
#REF
The cell or range of cells that the formula refers to aren’t there.
#VALUE
The formula includes a function that was used incorrectly, takes 
an invalid argument, or is misspelled. Make sure that the function 
uses the right argument and is spelled correctly.
 
 To find out more about a formula error and perhaps correct it, select the cell 
with the green triangle and click the Error button. This small button appears 
beside a cell with a formula error after you click the cell. The drop-down list 
on the Error button offers opportunities for correcting formula errors and 
finding out more about them.
Running the error checker
 
 Another way to tackle formula errors is to run the error checker. When the 
checker encounters what it thinks is an error, the Error Checking dialog box 
tells you what the error is, as shown in Figure 3-10. To run the error checker, 
go to the Formulas tab and click the Error Checking button (you may have to 
click the Formula Auditing button first, depending on the size of your 
screen).

Detecting and Correcting Errors in Formulas
If you see clearly what the error is, click the Edit in Formula Bar button, 
repair the error in the Formula bar, and click the Resume button in the 
dialog box (you find this button at the top of the dialog box). If the error isn’t 
one that really needs correcting, either click the Ignore Error button or click 
the Next button to send the error checker in search of the next error in your 
worksheet.

Tracing cell references
In a complex worksheet in which formulas are piled on top of one another 
and the results of some formulas are computed into other formulas, it helps 
to be able to trace cell references. By tracing cell references, you can see 
how the data in a cell figures into a formula in another cell. Also, if the cell 
contains a formula, you can tell which cells the formula is gathering its data 
from to make its computation. You can get a better idea of how your work-
sheet is constructed, and in so doing, find structural errors more easily.
Figure 3-11 shows how cell tracers describe the relationships between cells. 
A cell tracer is a blue arrow that shows the relationships between cells used 
in formulas. You can trace two types of relationships:

Working with Functions
 
 ✦ Tracing precedents: Select a cell with a formula in it and trace the for-
mula’s precedents to find out which cells are computed to produce the 
results of the formula. Trace precedents when you want to find out 
where a formula gets its computation data. Cell tracer arrows point from 
the referenced cells to the cell with the formula results in it.
 
 To trace precedents, go to the Formulas tab and click the Trace 
Precedents button (you may have to click the Formula Auditing button 
first, depending on the size of your screen).
 
 ✦ Tracing dependents: Select a cell and trace its dependents to find out 
which cells contain formulas that use data from the cell you selected. 
Cell tracer arrows point from the cell you selected to cells with formula 
results in them. Trace dependents when you want to find out how the 
data in a cell contributes to formulas elsewhere in the worksheet. The 
cell you select can contain a constant value or a formula in its own right 
(and contribute its results to another formula).
 
 To trace dependents, go to the Formulas tab and click the Trace 
Dependents button (you may have to click the Formula Auditing button 
first, depending on the size of your screen).
 
 To remove the cell tracer arrows from a worksheet, go to the Formulas tab 
and click the Remove Arrows button. You can open the drop-down list on 
this button and choose Remove Precedent Arrows or Remove Dependent 
Arrows to remove only cell-precedent or cell-dependent tracer arrows.
Working with Functions
A function is a canned formula that comes with Excel. Excel offers hundreds 
of functions, some of which are very obscure and fit only for use by rocket 
scientists or securities analysts. Other functions are very practical. For 
example, you can use the SUM function to quickly total the numbers in a 
range of cells. Instead of entering =C2+C3+C4+C5 on the Formula bar, you 
can enter =SUM(C2:C5), which tells Excel to total the numbers in cell C2, C3, 
C4, and C5. To obtain the product of the number in cell G4 and .06, you can 
use the PRODUCT function and enter =PRODUCT(G4,.06) on the Formula bar.
 
 Table 3-3 lists the most common functions. To get an idea of the numerous 
functions that Excel offers, go to the Formulas tab and click the Insert 
Function button. You see the Insert Function dialog box shown in Figure 
3-12. (Later in this chapter, I show you how you this dialog box helps you 
use functions in formulas.) Choose a function category in the dialog box,

choose a function name, and read the description. You can click the Help on 
This Function link to open the Excel Help window and get a thorough 
description of the function and how it’s used.
Table 3-3 
Common Functions and Their Use

arguments
PRODUCT(number1,number2,. . .)
The product of multiplying the cells listed in 
the arguments
STDEV(number1,number2,. . .)
An estimate of standard deviation based on 
the sample cells listed in the argument
STDEVP(number1,number2,. . .)
An estimate of standard deviation based 
on the entire sample cells listed in the 
arguments
SUM(number1,number2,. . .)
The total of the numbers in the arguments
VAR(number1,number2,. . .)
An estimate of the variance based on the 
sample cells listed in the arguments
VARP(number1,number2,. . .)
A variance calculation based on all cells 
listed in the arguments
Using arguments in functions
 
Every function takes one or more arguments. Arguments are the cell refer-
ences or numbers, enclosed in parentheses, that the function acts upon. For 
example, =AVERAGE(B1:B4) returns the average of the numbers in the cell 
range B1 through B4; =PRODUCT(6.5,C4) returns the product of multiplying 
the number 6.5 by the number in cell C4. When a function requires more 
than one argument, enter a comma between the arguments (enter a comma 
without a space).

Entering a function in a formula
To enter a function in a formula, you can enter the function name by typing 
it in the Formula bar, or you can rely on Excel to enter it for you. Enter func-
tion names yourself if you’re well acquainted with a function and comfort-
able using it.
No matter how you want to enter a function as part of a formula, start this way:
 
1. Select the cell where you want to enter the formula.
 
2. In the Formula bar, type an equals sign (=).
 
 Please, please, please be sure to start every formula by entering an 
equals sign (=). Without it, Excel thinks you’re entering text or a number 
in the cell.
 
3. Start constructing your formula, and when you come to the place 
where you want to enter the function, type the function’s name or call 
upon Excel to help you enter the function and its arguments.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Manually entering a function” shows you how to 
type in the function yourself; “Getting Excel’s help to enter a function” 
shows you how to get Excel to do the work.
 
 If you enter the function on your own, it’s up to you to type the argu-
ments correctly; if you get Excel’s help, you also get help with entering 
the cell references for the arguments.

Book V
Chapter 3
Formulas and 
Functions for 
Crunching Numbers
489
Working with Functions
Manually entering a function
Be sure to enclose the function’s argument or arguments in parentheses. 
Don’t enter a space between the function’s name and the first parenthesis. 
Likewise, don’t enter a comma and a space between arguments; enter a 
comma, nothing more:
=SUM(F11,F14,23)
 
You can enter function names in lowercase. Excel converts function names 
to uppercase after you click the Enter button or press Enter to complete the 
formula. Entering function names in lowercase is recommended because 
doing so gives you a chance to find out whether you entered a function name 
correctly. If Excel doesn’t convert your function name to uppercase, you 
made a typing error when you entered the function name.
To quickly total the numbers in cells, click on 
your worksheet where you want the total to 
appear, and then click the AutoSum button on 
the Home or Formulas tab. Excel takes an edu-
cated guess as to which cells need totaling, 
and the program highlights those cells. If Excel 
guesses correctly and highlights the cells you 
want to total, click the Enter button (or press 
Enter) and be done with it. Otherwise, select 
the cells you want to add up and then press 
Enter.
Similarly, you can use the drop-down list on 
the AutoSum button to quickly obtain the aver-
age, count of, maximum amount, or minimum 
amount of cells by clicking in a nearby cell, 
opening the drop-down list on the AutoSum 
button, and choosing Average, Count Numbers, 
Max, or Min.

Getting Excel’s help to enter a function
Besides entering a function by typing it, you can do it by way of the Function 
Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-13. The beauty of using this 
dialog box is that it warns you if you enter arguments incorrectly, and it 
spares you the trouble of typing the function name without making an error. 
What’s more, the Function Arguments dialog box shows you the results of 
the formula as you construct it so that you get an idea whether you’re using 
the function correctly.

Follow these steps to get Excel’s help with entering a function as part of a 
formula:
 
1. On the Formulas tab, tell Excel which function you want to use.
 
 You can do that with one of these techniques:
 
• Click a Function Library button: Click the button whose name 
describes what kind of function you want and choose the function’s 
name on the drop-down list. You can click the Financial, Logical, 
Text, Date & Time, Lookup & Reference, Math & Trig, or More 
Functions buttons.
 
• Click the Recently Used button: Click this button and choose the name 
of a function you used recently.
 
 
• Click the Insert Function button: Clicking this button opens the Insert 
Function dialog box (refer to Figure 3-12). Find and choose the name 
of a function. You can search for functions or choose a category and 
then scroll the names until you find the function you want.

 You see the Function Arguments dialog box (refer to Figure 3-13). It 
offers boxes for entering arguments for the function to compute.
 
2. Enter arguments in the spaces provided by the Function Arguments 
dialog box.
 
 To enter cell references or ranges, you can click or select cells in your 
worksheet. If necessary, click the Range Selector button (you can find it 
to the right of an argument text box) to shrink the Function Arguments 
dialog box and get a better look at your worksheet.

T
his chapter explains how to dress a worksheet in its Sunday best in case 
you want to print and present it to others. It explains how to align num-
bers and text, insert rows and columns, as well as change the size of rows 
and columns. You find out how to decorate a worksheet with colors and 
borders, as well as create and apply styles to make formatting tasks go more 
quickly. Finally, this chapter describes everything you need to know before 
you print a worksheet, including how to make it fit on one page and repeat 
row labels and column names on all pages.
Laying Out a Worksheet
Especially if you intend to print your worksheet, you may as well dress it 
in its Sunday best. And you can do a number of things to make worksheets 
easier to read and understand. You can change character fonts. You can 
draw borders around or shade important cells. You can also format the 
numbers so that readers know, for example, whether they’re staring at 
dollar figures or percentages. This part of Chapter 4 is dedicated to the 
proposition that a worksheet doesn’t have to look drab and solemn.
Aligning numbers and text in columns and rows
To start with, numbers in worksheets are right-aligned in cells, and text is 
left-aligned. Numbers and text sit squarely on the bottom of cells. You can, 
however, change the way that data is aligned. For example, you can make 
data float at the top of cells rather than rest at the bottom, and you can 

494
Laying Out a Worksheet
center or justify data in cells. Figure 4-1 illustrates different ways to align 
text and numbers. How text is aligned helps people make sense of your 
worksheets. In Figure 4-1, for example, Income and Expenses are left-aligned 
so that they stand out and make it clearer what the right-aligned column 
labels below are all about.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Ways to 
align data.
 
Wrapped

Reoriented
Select the cells whose alignment needs changing and follow these instruc-
tions to realign data in the cells:
 
✦ Changing the horizontal (side-to-side) alignment: On the Home tab, 
click the Align Text Left, Center, or Align Text Right button. You can 
also click the Alignment group button, and on the Alignment tab of the 
Format Cells dialog box, choose an option on the Horizontal drop-down 
list. Figure 4-2 shows the Format Cells dialog box.
 
✦ Changing the vertical (top-to-bottom) alignment: On the Home tab, 
click the Top Align, Middle Align, or Bottom Align button. You can also 
click the Alignment group button to open the Format Cells dialog box 
(refer to Figure 4-2) and choose an option on the Vertical drop-down list. 
The Justify option makes all the letters or numbers fit in a cell, even if it 
means wrapping text to two or more lines.
 
 
✦ Reorienting the cells: On the Home tab, click the Orientation button and 
choose an option on the drop-down list. (For Figure 4-2, I chose the 
Angle Counterclockwise option.) You can also click the Alignment group 
button, and on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box (refer to 
Figure 4-2), drag the diamond in the Orientation box or enter a number 
in the Degrees text box.

Changing the orientation of text in cells is an elegant solution to the problem 
of keeping a worksheet from getting too wide. Numbers are usually a few 
characters wide, but heading labels can be much wider than that. By chang-
ing the orientation of a heading label, you make columns narrower and keep 
worksheets from growing too fat to fit on the screen or page.
In the illustration shown here, “Sales Totals 
by Regional Office” is centered across four 
different cells. Normally, text is left-aligned, 
but if you want to center it across several 
cells, drag across the cells to select them, go 
to the Home tab, and click the Merge & Center 
button. Merging and centering allows you to 
display text across several columns.
To “unmerge and uncenter” cells, select the 
text that you merged and centered, open the 
drop-down list on the Merge & Center button, 
and choose Unmerge Cells. You can also dese-
lect the Merge Cells check box in the Format 
Cells dialog box (refer to Figure 4-2).

Inserting and deleting rows and columns
At some point, everybody has to insert new columns and rows and delete 
ones that are no longer needed. Make sure before you delete a row or 
column that you don’t delete data that you really need. Do the following to 
insert and delete rows and columns:
 
 
✦ Deleting rows or columns: Drag across the row numbers or column let-
ters of the rows or columns you want to delete; then right-click and 
choose Delete, or, on the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Delete button and select Delete Sheet Rows or Delete Sheet Columns.
 
 
✦ Inserting rows: Select the row below the row you want to insert; then, 
on the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Insert button and 
choose Insert Sheet Rows, or right-click the row you selected and 
choose Insert on the shortcut menu. For example, to insert a new row 
above row 11, select the current row 11 before choosing Insert Sheet 
Rows. You can insert more than one row at a time by selecting more 
than one row before giving the Insert Sheet Rows command.
 
✦ Inserting columns: Select the column to the right of where you want 
the new column to be; then, on the Home tab, open the drop-down list 
on the Insert button and choose Insert Sheet Columns, or right-click 
the column you selected and choose Insert on the shortcut menu. You 
can insert more than one column this way by selecting more than one 
column before giving the Insert command.
 
A fast way to insert several rows or columns is to insert one and keep 
pressing F4 (the Repeat command) until you insert all the rows or columns 
you need.
After you insert rows or columns, the Insert Options button appears. Click 
it and choose an option from the drop-down list if you want your new row 
or column to have the same or different formats as the row or column you 
selected to start the Insert operation.
 
To insert more than one row or column at a time, select more than one row 
number or column letter before giving the Insert command.
Changing the size of columns and rows
By default, columns are 8.43 characters wide. To make columns wider, you 
have to widen them yourself. Rows are 12.75 points high, but Excel makes 
them higher when you enter letters or numbers that are taller than 12.75 
points (72 points equals 1 inch). Excel offers a bunch of different ways to 
change the size of columns and rows. You can start on the Home tab and 
choose options on the Format button drop-down list, shown in Figure 4-3, or 
you can rely on your wits and change sizes manually by dragging or double-
clicking the boundaries between row numbers or column letters.

Before you change the size of columns or rows, select them (Chapter 2 of 
this mini-book explains how). Click or drag across row numbers to select 
rows; click or drag across column letters to select columns.

Adjusting the height of rows
Here are ways to change the height of rows:
 
✦ One at a time: Move the mouse pointer onto the boundary between row 
numbers and, when the pointer changes to a cross, drag the boundary 
between rows up or down. A pop-up box tells you how tall the row will 
be after you release the mouse button.
 
 
✦ Several at a time: Select several rows and drag the boundary between 
one of the rows; all rows change height. You can also go to the Home 
tab, click the Format button, choose Row Height, and enter a measure-
ment in the Row Height dialog box.
 
✦ Tall as the tallest entry: To make a row as tall as its tallest cell entry, 
double-click the border below a row number (after you’ve selected 
a row), or go to the Home tab, click the Format button, and choose 
AutoFit Row Height.
Adjusting the width of columns
Here are ways to make columns wider or narrower:

498
Decorating a Worksheet with Borders and Colors
 
✦ One at a time: Move the mouse pointer onto the boundary between 
column letters, and when the pointer changes to a cross, drag the 
border between the columns. A pop-up box tells you what size the 
column is.
 
 
✦ Several at a time: Select several columns and drag the boundary 
between one of the columns; all columns adjust to the same width. You 
can also go to the Home tab, click the Format button, choose Column 
Width, and enter a measurement in the Column Width dialog box.
 
✦ As wide as their entries: To make columns as wide as their widest 
entries, select the columns, go to the Home tab, click the Format button, 
and choose AutoFit Column Width on the drop-down list. You can also 
double-click the right border of a column letter. By “auto-fitting” col-
umns, you can be certain that the data in each cell in a column appears 
on-screen.
To change the 8.43-character standard width for columns in a worksheet, go 
to the Home tab, click the Format button, choose Default Width on the drop-
down list, and enter a new measurement in the Standard Width dialog box.
Decorating a Worksheet with Borders and Colors
The job of gridlines is simply to help you line up numbers and letters in 
cells. By default, gridlines aren’t printed, and because gridlines aren’t 
printed, drawing borders on worksheets is absolutely necessary if you 
intend to print your worksheet. Use borders to steer the reader’s eye to the 
most important parts of your worksheet — the totals, column labels, and 
heading labels. You can also decorate worksheets with colors. This part of 
the chapter explains how to put borders and colors on worksheets.
Cell styles for quickly formatting a worksheet
A style is a collection of formats — boldface text, a background color, or a 
border around cells — that can be applied all at one time to cells without 
having to visit a bunch of different dialog boxes or give a bunch of different 
commands. Styles save time. If you find yourself choosing the same format-
ting commands time and time again, consider creating a style. That way, 
you can apply all the formats simultaneously and go to lunch earlier. Excel 
comes with many built-in styles, and you can create styles of your own, as 
the following pages explain.
Applying a built-in cell style
By way of the Cell Styles gallery, you can choose from any number of attrac-
tive styles for cells in a worksheet. Excel offers styles for titles and head-
ings, styles for calling attention to what kind of data is in cells, and styles to 
accent cells. Follow these steps to reformat cells by choosing a cell style:

Creating your own cell style
The names of cell styles you create on your own are placed at the top of the 
Cell Styles gallery under the Custom heading. Create a cell style if you’re the 
creative type or if no built-in style meets your high standards. Follow these 
steps to create a cell style:
 
1. Apply the formatting commands you want for your style to a single 
cell.
 
 For example, left-align cell data. Or apply a fill color to the cells (see 
“Decorating worksheets with colors,” later in this chapter). Or change 
fonts and font sizes. Knock yourself out. Choose all the formatting com-
mands you want for your new style.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Cell Styles button to open the Cell Styles 
gallery.

3. Choose New Cell Style at the bottom of the gallery.
 
 You see the Style dialog box shown in Figure 4-5. It lists formatting speci-
fications you chose for the cell you selected in Step 1. If these specifica-
tions aren’t what you’re after, or if you want to change a specification, 
you can click the Format button and describe your new style in the 
Format Cells dialog box.

5. Click OK.
 
 Next time you open the Cell Styles gallery, you see the name of your 
style at the top under Custom.
To remove a style you created from the Cell Styles gallery, right-click its 
name in the gallery and choose Delete on the shortcut menu.
Formatting cells with table styles
Especially if your worksheet data is arranged neatly into columns and rows 
so that it looks like a conventional table, one of the easiest ways to decorate 
cells is to take advantage of table styles. Excel offers many preformatted 
table styles that you can apply to columns and rows on a worksheet.
Follow these steps to experiment with table styles:
 
1. Select the cells you want to format as a table.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Format As Table button and move your 
pointer over the table styles in the gallery to “live-preview” them.
 
3. Select a table style.
 
 The Format As Table dialog box appears.

 If you didn’t select cells in Step 1, click outside the Format As Table dialog 
box and select cells on your worksheet to tell Excel which cells to format.
 
5. Click OK in the Format As Table dialog box.
 
 You can go to the (Table Tools) Design tab to refine your table. Book I, 
Chapter 5 (about tables) describes the tools on this tab.
To remove a table style from cells, select the cells, go to the (Table Tools) 
Design tab, and choose None in the Table Styles gallery.
Slapping borders on worksheet cells
Put borders on worksheet cells to box in cells, draw lines beneath cells, or 
draw lines along the side of cells. Borders can direct people who review 
your worksheet to its important parts. Typically, for example, a line appears 
above the Totals row of a worksheet to separate the Totals row from the 
rows above and help readers locate cumulative totals.
To draw borders on a worksheet, start by selecting the cells around which 
or through which you want to place borders. Then do one of the following to 
draw the borders:
 
 
✦ Borders button: On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the 
Borders button (it’s in the Font group) and choose a border, as shown in 
Figure 4-6.

✦ Format Cells dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Format button and 
choose Format Cells, or choose More Borders on the Borders button 
drop-down list. The Format Cells dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 
4-7. On the Border tab, select a border style and either click in the 
Border box to tell Excel where to draw the border or click a Presets 
button. The Border tab offers different lines for borders and colors for 
borderlines as well.

Apply background colors to cells to make them stand out or help the people 
who review your worksheets understand how they are laid out. Select the 
cells that need a background color and use one of these techniques to 
splash color on your worksheet:
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Format button and choose Format Cells on 
the drop-down list. You see the Format Cells dialog box. On the Fill tab, 
select a color and click OK. Figure 4-7 shows what the Fill tab looks like.
 
✦ On the Home tab, open the drop-down list on the Fill Color button and 
select a color.
To remove colors from cells, select them, go to the Home tab, open the

Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
Printing a worksheet isn’t simply a matter of giving the Print command. A 
worksheet is a vast piece of computerized sprawl. Most worksheets don’t 
fit neatly on a single page. If you simply click the Print button to print your 
worksheet, you wind up with page breaks in unexpected places, both on the 
right side of the page and the bottom. Read on to discover how to set up a 
worksheet so that the people you hand it to can read and understand it.
Making a worksheet fit on a page
Unless you tell it otherwise, Excel prints everything from cell A1 to the last 
cell with data in it in the southeast corner of the worksheet. Usually, it isn’t 
necessary to print all those cells because some of them are blank. And print-
ing an entire worksheet often means breaking the page up in all kinds of awk-
ward places. To keep that from happening, following are some techniques 
for making a worksheet fit tidily on one or two pages.
 
 As you experiment with the techniques described here, switch occasionally 
to Page Layout view. In this view, you get a better idea of what your work-
sheet will look like when you print it. To switch to Page Layout view, click 
the Page Layout button on the status bar or View tab.
If you go to the trouble to lay out a very fine 
workbook, you may as well save it as a tem-
plate. That way, you (or your co-workers) can 
call upon your newfangled workbook next time 
you want to create a new Excel workbook. Any 
workbook that could be of use to someone else 
is a candidate for becoming a template.
Follow these steps to save a workbook as a 
template and be able to call upon its formats 
later on:
 1. On the File tab, choose Save As.
 
 You see the Save As dialog box.
 2. Enter a descriptive name for your template 
in the File Name text box.
 3. In the Save As Type drop-down list, 
choose Excel Template.
 4. Click the Save button.
 5. Back in your worksheet, delete the data 
that you don’t need when you create a file 
from your template and then click the Save 
button to save the template again.
To call upon the template you made to create a 
new Excel workbook, go to the File tab, choose 
New, click the My Templates icon in the 
Available Templates window, and in the New 
dialog box, select your template and click OK.

Printing part of a worksheet
 
 To print part of a worksheet, select the cells you want to print, go to the 
Page Layout tab, click the Print Area button, and choose Set Print Area on 
the drop-down list. This command tells Excel to print only the cells you 
selected. On the worksheet, a dotted line appears around cells in the print 
area. To remove the dotted lines from your worksheet, click the Print Area 
button and choose Clear Print Area on the drop-down list.
Printing a landscape worksheet
If your worksheet is too wide to fit on one page, try turning the page on its 
side and printing in landscape mode. In landscape mode, pages are wider 
than they are tall. Landscape mode is often the easiest way to fit a worksheet 
on a page.
 
 To make yours a landscape worksheet rather than a portrait worksheet, go 
to the Page Layout tab, click the Orientation button, and choose Landscape 
on the drop-down list.
Seeing and adjusting the page breaks
Reading a worksheet is extremely difficult when it’s broken awkwardly 
across pages. Where one page ends and the next begins is a page break. Use 
these techniques to see where page breaks occur, adjust the position of 
page breaks, and insert and remove page breaks:
 
 
✦ Viewing where pages break occur: Click the Page Break Preview button 
on the status bar or View tab. As shown in Figure 4-8, you switch to Page 
Break Preview view. In this view, page numbers appear clearly on the 
worksheet and dashed lines show you where Excel wants to break the 
pages.
 
✦ Adjusting page break positions: In Page Break Preview view, drag a 
dashed line to adjust the position of a page break. After you drag a 
dashed line, it ceases being a default page break and becomes a manual 
page break. Manual page breaks are marked by solid lines, not dashed 
lines (refer to Figure 4-8). You can drag them, too. Excel shrinks the 
numbers and letters on your worksheet if you try to squeeze too much 
data on a worksheet by dragging a page break.
 
 
✦ Inserting a page break: Select the cell directly below where you want 
the horizontal break to occur and directly to the right of where you want 
the vertical break to be, go to the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks 
button, and choose Insert Page Break (refer to Figure 4-8). Drag a page 
break to adjust its position.
 
✦ Removing a page break: Select a cell directly below or directly to the 
right of the page break, go to the Page Layout tab, click the Breaks 
button, and choose Remove Page Break (refer to Figure 4-8).

choose Reset All Page Breaks.
Switch to Page Layout or Normal view after you’re done fooling with page 
breaks. You can clearly see page breaks in Page Layout view. In Normal view, 
page breaks are marked by a dotted line.
“Scaling to fit” a worksheet
To scale the numbers and letters in a worksheet and make them a bit smaller 
so that they fit on a page, you can experiment with the Scale to Fit options. 
These options are located on the Page Layout tab. Starting in Page Layout 
view, go to the Page Layout tab and test-drive these options to make your 
worksheet fit on a single page or a certain number of pages:
 
✦ Scaling by width: Open the Width drop-down list and choose an option 
to make your worksheet fit across one or more pages. Choose the 1 Page 
option, for example, to squeeze a worksheet horizontally so that it fits 
on one page.
 
✦ Scaling by height: Open the Height drop-down list and choose an option 
to make your worksheet fit across on a select number of pages. For 
example, choose the 2 Pages option to shrink a worksheet vertically so 
that it fits on two pages.

506
Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
 
✦ Scaling by percentage: Enter a percentage measurement in the Scale 
box to shrink a worksheet vertically and horizontally. In order to scale 
this way, you must choose Automatic in the Width and Height drop-
down lists.
 
You can also fit a worksheet on a select number of pages by going to the 
Page Setup dialog box shown in Figure 4-9. With this technique, you get a 
chance to “print-preview” your worksheet and get a better look at it after 
you change the scale. On the Page Layout tab, click the Page Setup group 
button to open the Page Setup dialog box. On the Page tab, select the Fit 
To option button and enter the ideal number of pages you want for your 
worksheet in the Page(s) Wide By and Tall text boxes. Excel shrinks the data 
as much as is necessary to make it fit on the number of pages you asked 
for. Click the Print Preview button to preview your worksheet in the Print 
window and find out whether shrinking your worksheet this way helps.
Adjusting the margins
Another way to stuff all the data onto one page is to narrow the margins a 
bit. Go to the Page Layout tab and use either of these techniques to adjust 
the size of the margins:
 
 
✦ Click the Margins button and choose Narrow on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Click the Page Setup group button, and on the Margins tab of the Page 
Setup dialog box, change the size of the margins (refer to Figure 4-9). By 
clicking the Print Preview button, you can preview your worksheet in 
the Print window and adjust margins there by dragging them. Select the 
Show Margins button to display the margins. (This little button is in the 
lower-right corner of the Print window.)

Making a worksheet more presentable
Before you print a worksheet, visit the Page Setup dialog box and see what 
you can do to make your worksheet easier for others to read and under-
stand. To open the Page Setup dialog box, go to the Page Layout tab and 
click the Page Setup group button. Here are your options:
 
✦ Including page numbers on worksheets: On the Page tab of the Page 
Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 4-9), enter 1 in the First Page Number 
text box. Then, on the Header/Footer tab, open the Header or Footer 
drop-down list and choose an option that includes a page number. 
Choosing the Page 1 of ? option, for example, enters the page number 
and the total number of pages in the worksheet in your header or footer.
 
✦ Putting headers and footers on pages: On the Header/Footer tab of the 
Page Setup dialog box, choose options from the Header and Footer drop-
down lists. You can find options for listing the file name, page numbers, 
the date, and your name. By clicking the Custom Header or Custom 
Footer button, you can open the Header or Footer dialog box and con-
struct a header or footer there. Figure 4-10 shows the Header dialog box.
 
Figure 4-10: 
Constructing 
a fancy 
header.
 
 
✦ Centering worksheet data on the page: On the Margins tab, select 
Horizontally or Vertically to center the worksheet relative to the top or 
bottom or sides of the page. You can select both check boxes. The pre-
view screen shows what your choices mean in real terms.
 
✦ Printing gridlines, column letters, and row numbers: By default, the 
gridlines, column letters, and row numbers that you know and love in a 
worksheet aren’t printed, but you can print them by going to the Sheet 
tab of the Page Setup dialog box and selecting the Gridlines check box 
as well as the Row and Column Headings check box.
Repeating row and column headings on each page
If your worksheet is a big one that stretches beyond one page, you owe it 
to the people who view your worksheet to repeat row and column headings 

508
Getting Ready to Print a Worksheet
from page to page. Without these headings, no one can tell what the data in 
the worksheet means. Follow these steps to repeat row and column head-
ings from page to page:
 
 1. On the Page Layout tab, click the Print Titles button.
 
 
 You see the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
 
2. Select the Row and Column Headings check box.
 
 You can find this check box under Print.
 
3. To repeat rows, click the Range Selector button next to the Rows to 
Repeat at Top text box; to repeat columns, click the Range Selector 
button next to the Columns to Repeat at Left text box.
 
 These buttons are located on the right side of the dialog box. The dialog 
box shrinks so that you can get a better look at your worksheet.
 
4. Select the row or column with the labels or names you need.
 
 As long as they’re next to each other, you can select more than one row 
or column by dragging over the row numbers or column letters.
 
5. Click the Range Selector button to enlarge the dialog box and see it 
again.
 
 The text box now lists a cell range address.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to select column or row headings.
 
7. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
 
 If I were you, I would click the Print Preview button in the Page Setup 
dialog box first to make sure that row and column headings are indeed 
repeating from page to page.
To remove row and column headings, return to the Sheet tab of the Page 
Setup dialog box and delete the cell references in the Rows to Repeat at 
Top text box and the Columns to Repeat at Left text box. You can also press 
Ctrl+F3 and delete Print_Titles in the Name Manager dialog box.

T
his chapter offers a handful of tricks for analyzing the data that you so 
carefully and lovingly enter in a worksheet. Delve into this chapter to 
find out how to manage, sort, and filter worksheet lists. You also discover 
how the Goal Seek command can help you target values in different kinds of 
analysis, and how you can map out different scenarios with data by using 
one- and two-input data tables.
Managing Information in Lists
Although Excel is a spreadsheet program, many people use it to keep and 
maintain lists — address lists, product lists, employee lists, and inven-
tory lists, among other types of lists. These pages deal with all the differ-
ent things you can do with a worksheet list. They explain the difference 
between a conventional worksheet and a list, constructing a list, sorting a 
list, and filtering a list.
Constructing a list
To sort and filter data in a worksheet, your worksheet must be constructed 
like a list. Make sure that your worksheet has these characteristics:
 
✦ Column labels: Enter column labels along the top row, as shown in 
Figure 5-1. Excel needs these labels to identify and be able to filter the 
data in the rows below. Each label must have a different name. The row 
along the top of the worksheet where the column labels are is called the 
header row.
 
✦ No empty rows or columns: Sorry, but you can’t put an empty row or 
column in the middle of the worksheet list.
 
✦ No blank columns on the left: Don’t allow any empty columns to 
appear to the left of the list.

510
Managing Information in Lists
 
✦ A single worksheet: The list must occupy a single worksheet. You can’t 
keep more than one list on the same worksheet.
 
Figure 5-1: 
A worksheet 
as a list.
 
If you know anything about databases, the rules for constructing a work-
sheet list no doubt sound familiar. These are the same rules that apply to 
constructing a database table. You might consider managing your list as a 
database if it’s a long and complex one. Book VI explains how to use Access, 
the database program in Office 2010.
Sorting a list
Sorting means to rearrange the rows in a list on the basis of data in one or 
more columns. Sort a list on the Last Name column, for example, to arrange 
the list in alphabetical order by last name. Sort a list on the ZIP Code 
column to arrange the rows in numerical order by ZIP code. Sort a list on the 
Birthday column to arrange it chronologically from earliest born to latest 
born.
Starting on the Data tab, here are all the ways to sort a list:
 
 
✦ Sorting on a single column: Click any cell in the column you want to use 
as the basis for the sort, and then click the Sort Smallest to Largest or 
Sort Largest to Smallest button. (On the Home tab, you can get to these 
buttons by clicking the Sort & Filter button first.) For example, to sort 
item numbers from smallest to largest, click in the Item Number column 
and then click the Sort Smallest to Largest button.
 
 
✦ Sort on more than one column: Click the Sort button on the Data tab. 
You see the Sort dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2. Choose which col-
umns you want to sort with and the order in which you want to sort. To 
add a second or third column for sorting, click the Add Level button.

Book V
Chapter 5
Analyzing Data

ways.
 
Filtering a list
Filtering means to scour a worksheet list for certain kinds of data. To filter, 
you tell Excel what kind of data you’re looking for, and the program assem-
bles rows with that data to the exclusion of rows that don’t have the data. 
You end up with a shorter list with only the rows that match your filter crite-
ria. Filtering is similar to using the Find command except that you get more 
than one row in the results of the filtering operation. For example, in a list of 
addresses, you can filter for only addresses in California. In a price list, you 
can filter for items that fall within a certain price range.
 
 To filter a list, start by going to the Data tab and clicking the Filter button. As 
shown in Figure 5-3, a drop-down list appears beside each column header.

worksheet

data.
 
Click the Filter button

512
Forecasting with the Goal Seek Command
Your next task is to open a drop-down list in the column that holds the crite-
ria you want to use to filter the list. For example, if you want to filter the list 
to items that cost more than $100, open the Cost column drop-down list; if 
you want to filter the list so that only the names of employees who make less 
than $30,000 annually appears, open the Salary drop-down list.
After you open the correct column drop-down list, tell Excel how you want 
to filter the list:
 
✦ Filter by exclusion: On the drop-down list, deselect the Select All check 
box and then select the check box next to each item you don’t want to 
filter out. For example, to filter an Address list to addresses in Boston, 
Chicago, and Miami, deselect the Select All check box and then select 
the check boxes next to Boston, Chicago, and Miami on the drop-down 
list. Your filter operation turns up only addresses in these three cities.
 
✦ Filter with criteria: On the drop-down list, choose Number Filters, 
and then choose a filter operation on the submenu (or simply choose 
Custom Filter). You see the Custom AutoFilter dialog box.
 
 Choose an operator (equals, is greater than, or another) from the drop-
down list, and either enter or choose a target criterion from the list on 
the right side of the dialog box. You can search by more than one crite-
rion. Select the And option button if a row must meet both criteria to be 
selected, or select the Or option button if a row can meet either crite-
rion to be selected.
Click the OK button on the column’s drop-down list or the Custom AutoFilter 
dialog box to filter your list.
 
 To see all the data in the list again — to unfilter the list — click the Clear 
button on the Data tab.
Forecasting with the Goal Seek Command
In a conventional formula, you provide the raw data, and Excel produces the 
results. With the Goal Seek command, you declare what you want the results 
to be, and Excel tells you the raw data you need to produce those results. 
The Goal Seek command is useful in analyses when you want the outcome to 
be a certain way and you need to know which raw numbers will produce the 
outcome that you want.
Figure 5-4 shows a worksheet designed to find out the monthly payment 
on a mortgage. With the PMT function, the worksheet determines that the 
monthly payment on a $250,000 loan with an interest rate of 6.5 percent 
and to be paid over a 30-year period is $1,580.17. Suppose, however, that 
the person who calculated this monthly payment determined that he or she 

Book V
Chapter 5
Analyzing Data
513
Forecasting with the Goal Seek Command
could pay more than $1,580.17 per month? Suppose the person could pay 
$1,750 or $2,000 per month. Instead of an outcome of $1,580.17, the person 
wants to know how much he or she could borrow if monthly payments — 
the outcome of the formula — were increased to $1,750 or $2,000.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Experiment-
ing with the 
Goal Seek 
command.
 
To make determinations such as these, you can use the Goal Seek command. 
This command lets you experiment with the arguments in a formula to 
achieve the results you want. In the case of the worksheet in Figure 5-4, you 
can use the Goal Seek command to change the argument in cell C3, the total 
amount you can borrow, given the outcome you want in cell C6, $1,750 or 
$2,000, the monthly payment on the total amount.
Follow these steps to use the Goal Seek command to change the inputs in a 
formula to achieve the results you want:
 
1. Select the cell with the formula whose arguments you want to experi-
ment with.
 
 2. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Goal 
Seek on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Goal Seek dialog box (refer to Figure 5-4). The address of the 
cell you selected in Step 1 appears in the Set Cell box.
 
3. In the To Value text box, enter the target results you want from the 
formula.
 
 In the example in Figure 5-4, you enter 1750 or 2000, the monthly pay-
ment you can afford for the 30-year mortgage.
 
4. In the By Changing Cell text box, enter the address of the cell whose 
value is unknown.
 
 To enter a cell address, select a cell on your worksheet. In Figure 5-4, 
you select the address of the cell that shows the total amount you want 
to borrow.

514
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Goal Seek Status dialog box appears (refer to Figure 5-4). It lists the 
target value that you entered in Step 3.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 On your worksheet, the cell with the argument you wanted to alter now 
shows the target you’re seeking. In the case of the example worksheet in 
Figure 5-4, you can borrow $316,422 at 6.5 percent, not $250,000, by rais-
ing your monthly mortgage payments from $1,580.17 to $2,000.
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
For something a little more sophisticated than the Goal Seek command 
(which I describe in the preceding section), try performing what-if analyses 
with data tables. With this technique, you change the data in input cells and 
observe what effect changing the data has on the results of a formula. The 
difference between the Goal Seek command and a data table is that, with a 
data table, you can experiment simultaneously with many different input 
cells and in so doing experiment with many different scenarios.
Using a one-input table for analysis
In a one-input table, you find out what the different results of a formula would 
be if you change one input cell in the formula. In Figure 5-5, that input cell is 
the interest rate on a loan. The purpose of this data table is to find out how 
monthly payments on a $250,000, 30-year mortgage are different, given differ-
ent interest rates. The interest rate in cell B4 is the input cell.
Follow these steps to create a one-input table:
 
1. On your worksheet, enter values that you want to substitute for the 
value in the input cell.
 
 To make the input table work, you have to enter the substitute values in 
the right location:
 
• In a column: Enter the values in the column starting one cell below 
and one cell to the left of the cell where the formula is located. In 
Figure 5-5, for example, the formula is in cell E4 and the values are in 
the cell range D5:D15.
 
• In a row: Enter the values in the row starting one cell above and one 
cell to the right of the cell where the formula is.

2. Select the block of cells with the formula and substitute values.
 
 Select a rectangle of cells that encompasses the formula cell, the cell 
beside it, all the substitute values, and the empty cells where the new 
calculations will soon appear. In the case of a column, you select the for-
mula cell, the cell to its left, as well as all the substitute-value cells and 
the cells below the formula cell. In the case of a row, select the formula 
cell, the cell above it, as well as the substitute values in the cells directly 
to the right and the now-empty cells where the new calculations will 
appear.
 
 3. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Data 
Table on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Data Table dialog box.
 
4. In the Row Input Cell or Column Input Cell text box, enter the address 
of the cell where the input value is located.
 
 The input value is the value you’re experimenting with in your analysis. 
In the case of Figure 5-5, the input value is located in cell B4, the cell that 
holds the interest rate.
 
 If the new calculations appear in rows, enter the address of the input 
cell in the Row Input Cell text box; if the calculations appear in columns 
(refer to Figure 5-5), enter the input cell address in the Column Input 
Cell text box.

516
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.
To generate the one-input table, Excel constructs an array formula with 
the TABLE function. If you change the cell references in the first row or plug 
in different values in the first column, Excel updates the one-input table 
automatically.
Using a two-input table for analysis
In a two-input table, you can experiment with two input cells rather than 
one. Getting back to the example of the loan payment in Figure 5-5, you can 
calculate not only how loan payments change as interest rates change, but 
how payments change if the life of the loan changes. Figure 5-6 shows a 
two-input table for examining monthly loan payments given different inter-
est rates and two different terms for the loan, 15 years (180 months) and 30 
years (360 months).

data table.

Book V
Chapter 5
Analyzing Data
517
Performing What-If Analyses with Data Tables
Follow these steps to create a two-input data table:
 
1. Enter one set of substitute values below the formula in the same 
column as the formula.
 
 In Figure 5-6, different interest rates are entered in the cell range D5:D15.
 
2. Enter the second set of substitute values in the row to the right of the 
formula.
 
 In Figure 5-6, 180 and 360 are entered. These numbers represent the 
number of months of the life of the loan.
 
3. Select the formula and all substitute values.
 
 Do this correctly and you select three columns, including the formula, 
the substitute values below it, and the two columns to the right of 
the formula. You select a big block of cells (the range D4:F15, in this 
example).
 
 4. On the Data tab, click the What-If Analysis button and choose Data 
Table on the drop-down list.
 
 The Data Table dialog box appears (refer to Figure 5-6).
 
5. In the Row Input Cell text box, enter the address of the cell referred 
to in the original formula where substitute values to the right of the 
formula can be plugged in.
 
 In Figure 5-6, for example, the rows to the right of the formula are for 
length of loan substitute values. Therefore, I select cell B5, the cell 
referred to in the original formula where the length of the loan is listed.
 
6. In the Column Input Cell text box, enter the address of the cell 
referred to in the original formula where substitute values below the 
formula are.
 
 In Figure 5-6, the substitute values below the formula cell are interest 
rates. Therefore, I select cell B4, the cell referred to in the original for-
mula where the interest rate is entered.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Excel performs the calculations and fills in the table.

✓ Opening and closing tables
✓ Designing the tables, queries, forms, and the other parts of a database
T
he word database is prone to making most people feel kind of queasy. 
Can you blame them? Database terminology — record, field, and filter — 
is the worst of the worst. It even puts other computer terminology to shame. 
Databases intimidate most people. Even brave souls with a considerable 
amount of experience in Word and Excel shy away from Access, the Office 
2010 database program. However, Access can be invaluable for storing and 
organizing customer lists, inventories, addresses, payment histories, donor 
lists, and volunteer lists. What’s more, Access is easy to use, after you get 
the hang of it. No kidding!
This chapter starts you down the road to the Land of Oz. In truth, it intro-
duces databases and the concepts behind databases. It shows you how to 
create a database and database tables for storing information. The second 
half of this chapter explains how to design databases. Sorry, but you have 
to know about database design before you can start fooling with databases. 
You can’t jump right in as you can with the other Office programs.
 
Access offers a practice database called Northwind Traders that you can 
experiment with as you get to know your way around databases. To open 
this database, start Access and select Sample Templates in the Available 
Templates window. Then scroll in the list of sample templates, select 
Northwind, and click the Create button.
What Is a Database, Anyway?
Whether you know it or not, you’re no stranger to databases. The address 
book on your computer is a database. The telephone directory in the desk 
drawer is, too. A recipe book is also a database in that recipes are catego-
rized under different headings. If you ever arranged a CD collection in a 
certain way — in alphabetical order or by musical genre, for example — you 

522
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
created a database of CDs, one that makes finding a particular CD easier. 
Any place where information is stored in a systematic way can be consid-
ered a database. The only difference between a computerized database and 
a conventional database, such as a telephone directory, is that storing, find-
ing, and manipulating data is much easier in a computerized database.
Imagine how long it would take to find all the New York addresses in an 
address list with 10,000 entries. In Access, you can query a 10,000-entry data-
base and find all New York addresses in a matter of seconds. For that matter, 
you can query to find all the addresses in a certain ZIP Code. You can put 
the list in alphabetical order by last name or in numerical order by ZIP Code. 
Doing these chores without a computer requires many hours of dreary, 
monotonous labor.
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
One problem with getting to know a database program — and the primary 
reason that people are intimidated by databases — is that you can’t jump 
right in. You have to know how data is stored in a database and how it is 
extracted, to use programmer terminology. You have to know about objects, 
Access’s bland word for database tables, queries, forms, and all else that 
makes a database a database. To help you get going, these pages offer a 
crash course in databases. They explain the different objects — tables, que-
ries, forms, and reports — that make up a database. Fasten your seat belt. 
If you complete the crash course without crashing, you’re ready to create 
your first database.
Database tables for storing information
Information in databases is stored in database tables like the one in Figure 
1-1. In a database table, you include one field for each category of informa-
tion you want to keep on hand. Fields are the equivalent of columns in a 
table. Your first duty when you create a database table is to name the fields 
and tell Access what kind of information you propose to store in each field. 
The database table in Figure 1-1 is for storing employee information. It has 
seven fields: ID, First Name, Last Name, E-mail Address, Business Phone, 
Company, and Job Title.
A database can comprise one database table or many different tables that 
are linked together. If you’re dealing with a lot of information, storing data in 
more than one table is to your advantage. Later in this chapter, “Separating 
information into different database tables” explains why storing data across 
several database tables is advantageous.

Access database terminology
Stumbling over database terminology is easy. 
To keep yourself from stumbling, fold back the 
corner of this page and return here if one of 
these database terms puzzles you:
 ✓ Cell: In a database table, a place for enter-
ing one piece of data. Cells appear in a 
database table where a field and record 
intersect.
 ✓ Database: A systematic way of organizing 
information so that it can be retrieved and 
manipulated easily.
 ✓ Database table: A collection of data 
records arranged into well-defined cate-
gories, or fields. Most relational databases 
have more than one table.
 ✓ Dynaset: The results of a search for data in 
a database. (This term is short for dynamic 
set.) A dynaset is not to be confused with a 
dinosaur.
 ✓ Field: One category of information in a 
database table. Fields are the equivalent 
of columns in a conventional table.
 ✓ Filtering: Finding the records in a database 
table that have the same or nearly the 
same field value. Filtering is a more con-
venient but not as sophisticated means of 
querying a database.
 ✓ Foreign field: In a relationship between 
two database tables, the field that is on the 
“many” side of a one-to-many relationship. 
The primary key field is on the “one” side.
 ✓ Form: Similar to a dialog box, a place with 
text boxes and drop-down lists for entering 
records in a database table.
 ✓ Module: A Visual Basic procedure whose 
job is to perform a certain task in Access.
(continued)

524
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
(continued)
 ✓ Object: The catchall term for the tables, 
queries, forms, and reports that you create 
and open starting in the Navigation pane.
 ✓ Primary key field: The field in a database 
table where unique, one-of-a-kind data is 
stored. To query more than one database 
table at a time, the tables must have pri-
mary key fields.
 ✓ Query: A question asked of a database that 
yields information. Queries can be made of 
a single database table, several tables, or 
even other queries.
 ✓ Record: In a database table, all the data 
that’s recorded about one person or thing. 
A record is the equivalent of a row in a con-
ventional table.
 ✓ Relational database: A database program 
in which data is kept in more than one 
database table, relationships are estab-
lished between tables, and queries can be 
conducted and reports made by assem-
bling data from different tables. Access is 
a relational database. A database that per-
mits only one table is a flat-file database.
 ✓ Report: Information gathered from a data-
base and laid out in such a way that it’s 
easy to read and understand. Reports are 
meant to be printed and distributed.
 ✓ Sort: To rearrange records in a database 
table so that the records appear in alpha-
betical, numerical, or date order in one 
field.
Forms for entering data
After you create the fields in the database table, you can start entering the 
records. A record describes all the data concerning one person or thing. In 
Figure 1-1, eight records are entered in the database table. Each record com-
prises a person’s ID, first name, last name, e-mail address, business phone, 
company, and job title. Records are the meat of the database. Information is 
stored in records.
Although you can enter records straight into a database table, the easiest 
way to enter a record is with a form. Similar to a dialog box, a form has con-
venient text boxes and drop-down lists for entering information. Figure 1-2 
shows the form for entering a record in the database table shown in Figure 1-1. 
Notice that the form has one place for entering data in each field in the 
database table — First Name, Last Name, and so on. On a form, you can see 
clearly what kind of information needs entering in each field.
Queries for getting the data out
Figure 1-3 shows a simple query for finding out which employees in the 
database table shown in Figure 1-1 are Sales Representatives. A query is 
a question you ask of a database. The question here is, “Who is a Sales 
Representative?” Notice the criterion “Sales Representative” in the Job Title 
field on the Query grid.

Tables, Queries, Forms, and Other Objects
In an address database, you can use a query to find all the people in a par-
ticular ZIP Code or state. If information about contributions is stored in 
the database, you can find out who contributed more than $500 last year. 
Queries can get very complex. For example, you can find all the people in a 
particular city who contributed between $50 and $500 and volunteered more 
than eight hours in the past year. You can construct the query so that it pro-
duces each person’s name and telephone number, or you can construct it 
so that all the information you have concerning each person appears in the 
query results.
When you get junk mail, it likely comes to your mailbox as the result of a 
database query. Companies routinely buy and sell customer databases. They 
query these databases to gather the names of people who they believe are 
well-disposed to purchasing the products they sell. Next time you get junk 
mail solicitation, study the letter and ask yourself, “How did I get in this 
database, and which database query produced my name?” The junk mailer is 
probably targeting extraordinarily beautiful, intelligent people.
After you create a query, you can save it and run it again. You can use it as 
the basis for constructing new queries. The information in database tables 
usually changes over time. Customers change addresses. New products 
come online, and others are discontinued. But no matter how much the data 
changes, you can find out exactly what you want to know from a database by 
running a well-crafted query.
Reports for presenting and examining data
Figure 1-4 shows a report. Reports can be made from database tables or from 
the results of queries. Reports are usually read by managers and others who 
don’t get their hands dirty in databases. They’re meant to be printed and 
distributed so that the information can be scrutinized and analyzed. Access 
offers many attractive reports. Don’t worry — the program does most of the 
layout work for you, and exporting reports to a Word file is easy.
Macros and modules
Macros and modules aren’t covered in this mini-book, but they are also data-
base objects. A macro is a series of commands. You can store macros for 
running queries and doing other Access tasks. (Book VIII, Chapter 6 explains 
macros.) A module is a collection of Visual Basic procedures and declara-
tions for performing tasks in Access.

Creating a Database File
Creating a database is a lot of work, at least in the beginning. You have to 
design the database (a subject that I explain shortly). You have to enter the 
raw information into the tables. You have to construct queries that allow 
yourself and others to read meaning into the data (see Chapter 4 of this 
mini-book). By contrast, creating a database file for storing the information 
is the easy part.
Access offers two ways to create a new database file. You can do it from 
scratch or get the help of a template. With a template, some of the work is 
done already for you. The template comes with prefabricated queries, forms, 
and reports. However, templates are for people who already know their way 
around Access databases. To make use of a template, you have to know how 
to modify a preexisting database.
 
Before you create a database file, start by deciding where in your computer 
to store it. Unlike other Office programs, Access requires you to save and 
name a new file as soon as you create it.
Creating a blank database file
Follow these instructions to create a blank database file:
 
 1. Start Access (if it isn’t already running), or go to the File tab and 
choose New.
 
 The Available Templates window appears.

528
Finding Your Way Around the Navigation Pane
 
2. Click the Blank Database icon.
 
3. Click the folder icon (it’s in the lower-right corner of the window 
beside the File Name text box), and in the File New Database dialog 
box, select the folder where you want to keep the database file, enter 
a name in the File Name text box, and click OK.
 
4. Click the Create button.
 
 The Navigation pane and a blank table appear. Later in this chapter, 
“Finding Your Way Around the Navigation Pane” explains what this pane 
is all about. I suggest you go there without delay or deferral.
Getting the help of a template
As I explain earlier, templates are wonderful if you have the wherewithal 
to modify them. Access offers prefabricated databases for tracking 
assets, keeping inventory, scheduling resources, and doing other things. 
Unfortunately, the only way to find out whether one of the templates is 
worthwhile is to go to the trouble to create a database from a template, open 
up the database file, and look around.
Follow these steps to create a database file from a template:
 
 1. Start Access or go to the File tab and choose New.
 
 
 The Available Template window opens.
 
2. Click the Sample Templates icon.
 
3. Select a template.
 
 The template name appears on the right side of the window.
 
4. Click the folder icon (it’s in the lower-right corner of the window 
beside the File Name text box), and in the File New Database dialog 
box, select the folder where you want to keep the database file, enter 
a name in the File Name text box, and click OK.
 
5. Click the Create button.
Finding Your Way Around the Navigation Pane
The first thing you see when you open most database files is a Navigation 
pane like the one in Figure 1-5. This is the starting point for doing all your 
work in Access. From here, you can select an object — that horrible word 
again! — and begin working. Tables, queries, and other objects you create 
are added to the Navigation pane when you create them.

Here are shorthand instructions for doing this, that, and the other thing in 
the Navigation pane:
 
✦ Choosing an object type: Select a group (Tables, Queries, Forms, 
Reports, and so on) from the Object Type drop-down list at the top of 
the Navigation pane, or select All Access Objects to see all the groups, 
as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
✦ Creating a new object: Go to the Create tab and choose what type of 
object you want to create. When creating new forms and reports, click a 
table or query in the Navigation pane to base the new form or report on 
a table or query.
 
✦ Opening an object: To open a database table, query, form, or report, 
double-click it, select it and press Enter, or right-click it and choose 
Open on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Opening an object in Design view: The task of formulating database 
tables, forms, and queries is done in Design view. If an object needs 
reformulating, right-click it and choose Design View on the shortcut 
menu.

✦ Finding objects: Use the Search bar (located at the top of the Navigation 
pane) to search for objects.
 
✦ Opening and closing the Navigation pane: Click the Shutter Bar Open/
Close button on the upper-right corner of the Navigation pane (or press 
F11) when you want to shrink it and get it out of the way. You can also 
resize this pane by clicking the far-right edge and dragging it left or right.
Designing a Database
Being a database designer isn’t nearly as glamorous as being a fashion 
designer, but it has its rewards. If you design your database carefully and cor-
rectly, it can be very useful to you and others. You can enter information accu-
rately. When the time comes to draw information from the database, you get 
precisely the information you need. These pages explain everything you need 
to consider when designing a database. Pay close attention to “Separating 
information into different database tables,” later in this chapter, because the 
hardest part about designing a database is deciding how to distribute informa-
tion across database tables and how many database tables to have.
Deciding what information you need
The first question to ask yourself is about the kind of information you want 
to get out of the database. Customer names and addresses? Sales informa-
tion? Information for inventory tracking? Interview your co-workers to find 
out what information could be helpful to them. Give this matter some seri-
ous thought. Your goal is to set up the database so that every tidbit of infor-
mation your organization needs can be recorded.
 
A good way to find out what kind of information matters to an organization 
is to examine the paper forms that the organization uses to solicit or record 
information. These forms show precisely what the organization deems 
worthy of tracking in a database. Figure 1-6, for example, shows the paper 
form that players fill out to sign up for a baseball league whose database 
tables appear in Figure 1-7. Compare Figure 1-6 with Figure 1-7, and you can 
see that the Players, Teams, and Divisions database tables all have fields for 
entering information from this form.
Separating information into 
different database tables
After you know the information you want to record in the database, think 
about how to separate the information into database tables. Many are 
tempted to put all the information into a single database table, but because 
Access is a relational database, you can query more than one table at a time, 
and in so doing, assemble information from different tables.

Figure 1-7: 
Plans for

tables and 
field names.
 
To see how it works, consider the simple database shown in Figure 1-7. The 
purpose of this little database and its four tables is to store information about 
the players, coaches, and teams in a baseball league. The Team Name field 
appears in three tables. It serves as the link between the tables and permits 
more than one to be queried. By querying individual tables or combinations 
of tables in this database, I can assemble team rosters, make a list of coaches 
and their contact information, list teams by division, put together a mailing 
list of all players, find out which players have paid their fee, and list players by 
age group, among other things. This database comprises four tables:
 
✦ Players: Includes fields for tracking players’ names, addresses, birth-
days, which teams they’re on, and whether they paid their fees.
 
✦ Coaches: Includes fields for tracking coaches’ names, addresses, and the 
names of the teams they coach.
 
✦ Teams: Includes fields for tracking team names and which division each 
team is in.
 
✦ Divisions: Includes fields for tracking division numbers and names.
Deciding how many database tables you need and how to separate data 
across the different tables is the hardest part of designing a database. To 

532
Designing a Database
make the task a little easier, do it the old-fashioned way with a pencil and 
eraser. Here are the basic rules for separating data into different tables:
 
✦ Restrict a table to one subject only: Each database table should hold 
information about one subject only — customers, employees, products, 
and so on. This way, you can maintain data in one table independently 
from data in another table. Consider what would happen in the little 
league database (refer to Figure 1-7) if coach and team data were kept in 
a single table, and one team’s coach was replaced by someone new. You 
would have to delete the old coach’s record, delete information about 
the team, enter information about the new coach, and reenter informa-
tion about the team that you just deleted. But by keeping team informa-
tion separate from coach information, you can update coach information 
and still maintain the team information.
 
✦ Avoid duplicate information: Try not to keep duplicate information in 
the same database table or duplicate information across different tables. 
By keeping the information in one place, you have to enter it only once, 
and if you have to update it, you can do so in one database table, not 
several.
Entire books have been written about database design, and this book can’t 
do the subject justice. You can, however, store all your data in a single table 
if the data you want to store isn’t very complex. The time you lose entering 
all the data in a single table is made up by the time you save not having to 
design a complex database with more than one table.
Choosing fields for database tables
As I explain earlier, fields are categories of information. Each database table 
needs at least one field. If the table itself is a subject, you could say that its 
fields are facts about the subject. An Address database table needs fields 
for recording street addresses, cities, states, and ZIP codes. A Products data-
base table needs fields for product ID numbers, product names, and unit 
prices. Just the facts, ma’am. Within the confines of the subject, the data-
base table needs one field for each piece of information that is useful to 
your organization.
When you’re planning which fields to include in a database table, follow 
these guidelines:
 
✦ Break up the information into small elements. For example, rather than 
a Name field, create a First Name field and a Last Name field. This way, 
you can sort database tables by last name more easily.
 
✦ Give descriptive names to fields so that you know what they are later. A 
more descriptive name, such as Serial Number, is clearer than SN.

Book 6
Chapter 1
Introducing Access
533
Designing a Database
 
✦ Think ahead and include a field for each piece of information your orga-
nization needs. Adding a field to a database table late in the game is a 
chore. You have to return to each record, look up the information, and 
enter it.
 
✦ Don’t include information that can be derived from a calculation. As I 
explain in Chapter 4 of this mini-book, calculations can be performed as 
part of a query or be made part of a table. For example, you can total the 
numbers in two fields in the same record or perform mathematical cal-
culations on values in fields.
Deciding on a primary key field 
for each database table
 
Each database table must have a primary key field. This field, also known 
as the primary key, is the field in the database table where unique, one-of-a-
kind data is stored. Data entered in this field — an employee ID number, a 
part number, a bid number — must be different in each record. If you try to 
enter the same data in the primary key field of two different records, a dialog 
box warns you not to do that. Primary key fields prevent you from entering 
duplicate records. They also make queries more efficient. In a query, you 
tell Access what to look for in database tables, Access searches through 
the tables, and the program assembles information that meets the criteria. 
Primary key fields help Access recognize records and not collect the same 
information more than once in a query.
Social security numbers make good primary key fields because no two 
people have the same social security number. Invoice numbers and serial 
numbers also make excellent primary key fields. Returning to the sample 
baseball league database (refer to Figure 1-7), which fields in the little league 
database tables are primary key fields? In the Teams table, Team Name can 
be the primary key field because no two teams have the same name. Division 
Number can also be a primary key field because divisions in the league are 
numbered and no two divisions have the same number.
The Players and Coaches database tables, however, present a problem when 
it comes to choosing a primary key field. Two players might have the same 
last name, which rules out Last Name as a primary key field. A brother and 
sister might have the same telephone number, which rules out a Telephone 
No. field. Because no field holds values that are certain to be different 
from record to record, I introduce fields called Player Number and Coach 
Number. For the purpose of this database, players and coaches are assigned 
numbers. (Chapter 2 in this mini-book explains how Access can assign 
sequential numbers for you in a database table.)
Mapping the relationships between tables

534
Designing a Database
If your database includes more than one table, you have to map how the 
tables relate to one another. Usually, relationships are formed between the 
primary key field in one table and the corresponding field in another, called 
the foreign key. Figure 1-8 shows the relationships between the tables in the 
little league database. Because these tables are linked by common fields, 
I can gather information from more than one table in a query or report. 
Chapter 2 in this mini-book takes up the subject of linking tables in more 
detail. For now, when you design your database, consider how to connect 
the various tables with common fields.

D
atabase tables are the building blocks of a database. They hold the 
raw data. Relationships between the tables permit you to query and 
generate reports from several different tables. How well your database 
tables are put together and how accurately data is entered in the tables 
determine whether your database is a thing of beauty or a wilted flower.
This chapter explains how to create database tables and fields for the 
tables. It explains what primary key fields are and how primary key fields 
and indexed fields make it easier for Access to sort, search, and query a 
database. This chapter describes how to forge relationships between tables. 
Fasten your seat belts. In this chapter, you find numerous tips and tricks for 
making sure that data is entered accurately in your database tables.
Creating a Database Table
Raw data is stored in database tables (or in a single table if you decide to 
keep all the data in one place). The first and most important part of setting 
up a database is creating the tables and entering the data. After you enter 
the data, you can harass your database for information about the things and 
people your database keeps track of. If you haven’t done so already, read 
the sections in Chapter 1 of this mini-book that pertain to storing informa-
tion and designing a database before you create a database table. Chapter 
1 of this mini-book explains what database tables are and how to fashion a 
splendid one.

536
Creating a Database Table
The business of creating a database table starts on the Create tab. As I 
explain in detail in the next pages, Access offers three ways to create a data-
base table:
 
✦ Create the database table from scratch: Enter and format the fields one 
at a time on your own.
 
✦ Get the help of a template: Get prefabricated fields assembled in a 
table. This is the way to go if you know Access well, and you can modify 
database tables and table fields.
 
✦ Import the database table from another database: This technique can 
be an enormous timesaver if you can recycle data that has already been 
entered in a database table in another Access database.
Creating a database table from scratch
Creating a table from scratch entails creating the table and then entering the 
fields one by one. After you open a database file, follow these steps to create 
a database table from scratch:
 
1. Go to the Create tab.
 
 2. Click the Table Design button.
 
 
 The Design window appears. From here, you enter fields for your data-
base table. I hate to be like a City Hall bureaucrat who gives everybody 
the runaround, but I can’t help myself. Turn to “Entering and Altering 
Table Fields,” later in this chapter, to find out how to enter fields in a 
database table.
 
3. Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a descriptive name for your table and click OK.
 
 Return to the Navigation pane and you see the name of the table you 
created. If you don’t believe me, click the Tables group to see the names 
of tables in your database.
Creating a database table from a template
If you know your way around Access and know how to modify database 
tables, you can do worse than create a database table with a template. 
Access offers four table templates: Contacts (for storing contact addresses 
and phone numbers), Issues (for prioritizing issues), Tasks (for tracking 
projects, their status, and when they are due), and Users (for storing e-mail 
addresses). As well as creating a table, Access creates ready-made queries, 
forms, and reports to go along with the table. After you create a table with 
a template, you can remove fields that you don’t want. It’s always easier to 
delete fields than it is to add new ones.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Builiding Your 
Database Tables
537
Creating a Database Table
Follow these steps to use a template to create a table (and accompanying 
queries, forms, and reports):
 
1. Close all objects if any objects are open.
 
 To close an object, click its Close button.
 
 2. On the Create tab, click the Application Parts button.
 
 
 A drop-down list with options for creating forms and tables appears. 
(The tables are listed under “Quick Start.”)
 
3. Choose Contacts, Issues, Tasks, or Users.
 
 If there are other tables in your database, a dialog box asks whether 
you want to create a relationship between the table you’re creating and 
another table.
 
4. Select the There Is No Relationship option button and click Create.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Establishing Relationships between Database 
Tables” explains how to create relationships on your own. If you want to 
create these relationships now and you have the wherewithal to do it, 
select an option besides There Is No Relationship, choose a table on the 
drop-down list, and click the Next button to choose which field to forge 
the relationship with.
 
5. On the Navigation pane, right-click the name of the table you created 
and choose Design View.
 
 In Design view, you can see the names of the fields in the table. If the 
table contains fields you don’t want or you want to change the names 
of the fields, turn to “Entering and Altering Table Fields,” later in this 
chapter.
Importing a table from another database
Few things are more tedious than entering records in a database table. If 
the records you need were already entered elsewhere, more power to you. 
Follow these steps to get a database table from another Access database:
 
1. Go to the External Data tab.
 
 2. Click the Access button.
 
 
 The Get External Data – Access Database dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the Browse button, and in the File Open dialog box, select the 
Access database with the table you need and click Open.
 
 You return to the Get External Data – Access Database dialog box.
 
4. Select the first option button (Import Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports, 
Macros, and Modules into the Current Database) and click OK.
 
 You see the Import Objects dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1.

538
Opening and Viewing Tables
 
Figure 2-1: 
Fetching a 
table from 
another 
database.
 
 
5. On the Tables tab, select the database table you want.
 
 You can import more than one database table by clicking several table 
names or clicking the Select All button.
 
 You can import a table structure — its field names and formats — with-
out importing the data in the table. To do so, click the Options button 
in the Import Objects dialog box, and under Import Tables, select the 
Definition Only option button.
 
6. Click OK.
 
If the table you want to import includes lookup fields, import the tables or 
queries that the lookup fields refer to as well as the table itself. Without 
those tables or queries, the lookup fields won’t be able to obtain any values. 
Later in this chapter, “Creating a lookup data-entry list” explains what 
lookup fields are.
Opening and Viewing Tables
To open a table, start in the Navigation pane and select the Tables group 
to view the names of database tables you created. How you open a table 
depends on whether you want to open it in Datasheet view or Design view. 
Figure 2-2 illustrates the difference between these views. Datasheet view is 
for entering and examining data in a table; Design view is for creating fields 
and describing their parameters.

✦ Opening in Datasheet view: On the Navigation pane, double-click the 
table’s name or right-click its name and choose Open on the shortcut 
menu.
 
  
 
✦ Switching between views with the View button: On the Home tab, click 
the View button. This button changes appearance, depending on 
whether you’re in Design view or Datasheet view.

Entering and Altering Table Fields
After you create a database table, the next task is to enter the fields, or if 
Access created the table for you, alter the fields to your liking. As Chapter 
1 of this mini-book explains, fields represent categories of information in a 

540
Entering and Altering Table Fields
database table. They are the equivalent of columns in a conventional table. 
Fields determine what kind of information is stored in a database table.
These pages explain how to create a field, choose the right data type, dis-
play data in fields, and designate the primary key field in a table. While I’m 
on the subject of fields, W.C. Fields said, “Horse sense is the thing a horse 
has which keeps it from betting on people.”
Creating a field
Create a field on your own or get Access’s help and create a ready-made field. 
Both techniques are described here. Ready-made fields include fields designed 
especially for storing currency data, hyperlinks, and date information.
Creating a field on your own
To create a field on your own, open the table that needs a new field and 
follow these steps on the (Table Tools) Design tab:
 
1. Switch to Design view if you aren’t already there.
 
 To switch to Design view, click the View button on the Home tab and 
choose Design View on the drop-down list.
 
2. If necessary, insert a new row for the field.
 
 
 To do so, click in the field that is to go after the new field and then click 
the Insert Rows button.
 
3. Enter a name in the Field Name column.
 
 Names can’t include periods or be longer than 64 letters, but you don’t 
want to enter a long name anyway because it won’t fit very well along 
the top of the table.
 
 Some database programs don’t permit spaces in field names. If you 
intend to export Access data to other database programs, don’t include 
spaces in field names. Instead, run the words together or separate 
words with an underscore character, like this: underscore_character.
 
4. Press the Tab key or click in the Data Type column, and choose a data 
type from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
 Data types classify what kind of information is kept in the field. The next 
topic in this chapter, “All about data types,” explains data types.
 
5. If you want, enter a description in the Description column.
 
 These descriptions can be very helpful when you need to reacquaint 
yourself with a field and find out what it’s meant to do.

Choose a data type
Define field properties
 
In case the name you choose for your field isn’t descriptive enough, you can 
give the field a second name. The name appears in Datasheet view, on forms, 
and on reports. To enter a second, descriptive field name, enter the name in 
the Caption field on the General tab of the Design view window.
Later in this chapter, “Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are 
Accurate” demonstrates how to define field properties in the Design view 
window to make it easier for data-entry clerks to enter the data.
Taking advantage of ready-made fields
You can get a head start creating a field by using a ready-made field and then 
modifying it, if necessary. To create a ready-made field, switch to Datasheet 
view and select the field that you want your new field to go after. Then, on 
the (Table Tools) Fields tab, click a field button or click the More Fields 
button and choose the name of a field on the drop-down list.
Look for field buttons in the Add & Delete group. Field buttons include Text, 
Number, and Currency. After you create your new field, switch to Design 
view and examine its field properties. Some of these properties may need 
modifying. See “Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are 
Accurate” for information about field properties.

542
Entering and Altering Table Fields
All about data types
To choose a data type for a field, open the Data Type drop-down list in the 
Design view window and choose a data type (refer to Figure 2-3). Data types 
are the first line of defense in making sure that data is entered correctly in a 
table. Try to enter text in a field assigned the Currency or Number data type, 
and Access tells you that your entry is invalid. You get the chance to fix your 
mistake as soon as you make it.
Table 2-1 explains the options on the Data Type drop-down list. Choose 
data types carefully because how you classify the data that is entered in a 
field determines how you can query the field for information. Querying for 
a number range is impossible, for example, if the field you’re querying isn’t 
classified as a Number or Currency field on the Data Type drop-down list.
Table 2-1 
Data Types for Fields
Data Type
What It’s For
Text
For storing text (city names, for example), combinations 
of text and numbers (street addresses, for example), and 
numbers that won’t be calculated or used in expressions 
(telephone numbers, ZIP Codes, and social security numbers, 
for example). By default, a Text field is 50 characters long but 
Text fields can be 255 characters if you need that many. If you 
need that many characters, however, you probably need the 
Memo data type, not the Text data type.
Memo
For storing long descriptions. Fields assigned this data type 
can hold 65,535 characters (not that anyone needs that many).
Number
For storing numbers to be used in calculations or sorting. (If 
you’re dealing with monetary figures, choose the Currency 
data type.)
Date/Time
For storing dates and times and being able to sort data chron-
ologically or use dates and times in calculations.
Currency
For storing monetary figures for use in calculations and sorting. 
AutoNumber
For entering numbers in sequence that will be different from 
record to record. Use the AutoNumber data type for the pri-
mary key field if no other field stores unique, one-of-a-kind 
data. (See “Designating the primary key field,” later in this 
chapter.)
Yes/No
For storing True/False, Yes/No, On/Off type data. Choose this 
data type to enter data with a check box in the field. When 
the box is selected, the data in the field is True, Yes, or On, for 
example.

Book VI

Entering and Altering Table Fields
Data Type
What It’s For
OLE Object
For embedding an OLE link in your Access table to another 
object — an Excel worksheet or Word document. (Consider 
using the Attachment data type as well.)
Hyperlink
For storing hyperlinks to other locations on the Internet or on 
the company intranet. 
Attachment
For storing an image, spreadsheet, document, chart, or other 
file. Attaching a file to a database table is similar to attaching 
a file to an e-mail message. Attachments do not require as 
much hard drive space as OLE objects because they don’t 
require Access to store a bitmap image of the original file.
Calculated
For entering a mathematical expression that uses data from 
other fields in the database table.
Lookup Wizard
For creating a drop-down list with choices that a data-entry 
clerk can choose from when entering data. See “Creating a 
lookup data-entry list,” later in this chapter.
Designating the primary key field
As I explain in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, no database table is complete 
without a primary key field. The primary key field identifies which field in 
the table is unique and contains data that differs from record to record. 
Duplicate values and null values can’t be entered in the primary key field. 
(A null value indicates a missing or unknown value.) Choosing a primary 
key field is so important that Access doesn’t let you close a table unless you 
choose one.
 
If no field in your table holds one-of-a-kind data that is different from record 
to record, get around the problem with one of these techniques:
 
✦ The AutoNumber data type: Create a new field, give it a name, choose 
AutoNumber from the Data Type drop-down list (refer to Figure 2-3), 
and make your new field the primary key field. This way, when you 
enter data, Access enters a unique number to identify each record in the 
field. (To generate random numbers rather than sequential numbers in 
an AutoNumber field, go to the General tab of the Design view window, 
open the New Values drop-down list, and choose Random rather than 
Increment.)

544
Entering and Altering Table Fields
 
✦ A multiple-field primary key: Combine two or more fields and designate 
them as the primary key. For example, if you’re absolutely certain that 
no two people whose names will be entered in your database table have 
the same name, you can make the First Name and Last Name fields the 
primary key. The problem with multiple-field primary keys, however, 
is that it takes Access longer to process them, and you run the risk of 
entering duplicate records.
Follow these steps on the (Table Tools) Design tab to designate a field in a 
database table as the primary key field:
 
1. In Design view, select the field or fields you want to be the 
primary key.
 
 To select a field, click its row selector, the small box to its left; Ctrl+click 
row selectors to select more than one field.
 
 2. Click the Primary Key button.
 
 
 A small key symbol appears on the row selector to let you know which 
field or fields is the primary key field.
To decide how numbers, times, dates, currency 
values, and Yes/No data are displayed in fields, 
go to the General tab in the Field Properties part 
of the Design view and choose an option on the 
Format drop-down list. The display options are 
useful indeed. Choose the Currency format, 
for example, and you don’t have to enter the 
dollar signs or commas when you enter a dollar 
figure in the field because the dollar sign and 
commas are entered for you.
Moreover, you can create a format of your own 
by entering these placeholder symbols in the 
Format text box:
 ✓ @ (at symbol): A character or space is 
required. For example, @@@@-@@ inserts 
a hyphen between the first set of numbers 
and the second. You don’t have to enter the 
hyphen, only the text or numbers.
 ✓ & (ampersand): A character or space is 
optional. For example, @@@@@-&&&& 
in a ZIP Code field tells Access that either 
entry is correct, a five-character ZIP Code 
or a five-character plus the four extra char-
acters ZIP Code.
 ✓ > (right bracket): Displays all characters in 
the field as uppercase. Merely by entering 
this symbol in the Format text box, you can 
display all entries in the field as uppercase 
without the data-entry clerk having to hold 
down the Shift or Caps Lock key.
 ✓ < (left bracket): Displays all characters in 
the field as lowercase.

To remove a primary key, click its row selector and then click the Primary 
Key button all over again.
Moving, renaming, and deleting fields
Suppose that you need to move, rename, or delete a field. To do so, switch 
to Design view and follow these instructions:
 
✦ Moving a field: Select the field’s row selector (the box to its left) and 
release the mouse button. Then click again and drag the selector up or 
down to a new location.
 
✦ Renaming a field: Click in the Field Name box where the name is, delete 
the name that’s there, and type a new name.
 
 
✦ Deleting a field: Click in the Field Name box, go to the (Table Tools) 
Design tab, and click the Delete Rows button. You can also right-click 
the field and choose Delete Rows on the shortcut menu.
Field Properties for Making Sure 
That Data Entries Are Accurate
Unfortunately, entering the data in a database table is one of the most 
tedious activities known to humankind. And because the activity is so dull, 
people are prone to make mistakes when they enter data in a database table. 
One way to cut down on mistakes is to take advantage of the Field Properties 
settings on the General tab in the Design view window. Figure 2-4 shows the 
General tab.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Establishing 
field 
properties.
 
Description of the property
Field properties
These properties determine what can and can’t be entered in the different 
fields of a database table. Some of the settings are invaluable. The Field Size 
property, for example, determines how many characters can be entered in a 
field. In a State field where two-letter state abbreviations are to be entered, 

546
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
make the Field Size property 2 to be certain that no one enters more than 
two characters. If the majority of people you’re tracking in an address 
database live in New York, enter NY in the Default Value property. That way, 
you spare data-entry clerks from having to enter NY the majority of the time. 
They won’t have to enter it because NY is already there.
The Lookup tab in the Field Properties part of the Design view window is 
for creating a data-entry drop-down list. It, too, is invaluable. If you happen 
to know that only four items can be entered in a field, create a drop-down 
list with the four items. That way, data-entry clerks can choose from a list of 
four valid items instead of having to enter the data themselves and perhaps 
enter it incorrectly. (See “Creating a lookup data-entry list,” later in this 
chapter.)
A look at the Field Properties settings
Especially if yours is a large database, you’re encouraged to study the field 
properties carefully and make liberal use of them. The Field Properties set-
tings safeguard data from being entered incorrectly. Following is a descrip-
tion of the different properties (listed here in the order in which they appear 
in the Design view window) and instructions for using them wisely. Which 
properties you can assign to a field depends on which data type the field 
was assigned.
Field Size
In the Field Size box for Text fields, enter the maximum number of charac-
ters that can be entered in the field. Suppose that the field you’re dealing 
with is ZIP Code, and you want to enter five-number ZIP Codes. By entering 5 
in the Field Size text box, only five characters can be entered in the field. A 
sleepy data-entry clerk couldn’t enter a six-character ZIP Code by accident.
For Number fields, select a value for the field size from the drop-down list. 
Table 2-2 describes these field sizes.
Table 2-2 
Numeric Field Sizes
Field Size
Description
Byte
An integer that holds values from 0–255.

An integer that holds values from -32,768–+32,767.
Long Integer
An integer that holds values from -2,147,483,648–
+2,147,483,647.
Single
A floating point number that holds large values up to 
7 significant digits.

Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
Field Size
Description
Double 
A floating point number that holds large values up to 
15 significant digits.
Replication ID*
A globally unique identifier (GUID) required for replication; 
this number is generated randomly.
Decimal
A number with defined decimal precision. The default 
precision is 0, but you can set the scale up to 28.
*Not supported by the ACCDB file format.
 
The Single, Double, and Decimal field size options hold different ranges of 
numbers. For now, if you need to store numbers after the decimal point, 
choose the Double field size so that you cover most situations.
Format
Earlier in this chapter, the “Deciding how the data in fields is displayed” 
sidebar explains the Format property. Click the drop-down list and choose 
the format in which text, numbers, and dates and times are displayed.
Decimal Places
For a field that holds numbers, open the Decimal Places drop-down list and 
choose how many numbers can appear to the right of the decimal point. 
This property affects how numbers and currency values are displayed, not 
their real value. Numbers are rounded to the nearest decimal point. The 
Auto option displays the number of decimal places that the format you 
choose on the Format drop-down list permits.
Input Mask
For Text and Date field types, this feature provides a template with punc-
tuation marks to make entering the data easier. Telephone numbers, social 
security numbers, and other numbers that typically are entered along with 
dashes and parentheses are ideal candidates for an input mask (another 
ridiculous database term!). On the datasheet, blank spaces appear where the 
numbers go, and the punctuation marks stand at the ready to receive num-
bers, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Input masks.
 

548
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
In the Input Mask text box, enter a 0 where numbers go, and enter the punc-
tuation marks where they go. For example, enter (000) 000-0000 or 000/000-
0000 to enter an input mask for a telephone number like the one shown in 
Figure 2-5. You can also create input masks by clicking the three dots beside 
the Input Mask text box. Doing so opens the Input Mask Wizard dialog box, 
where you can fashion a very sophisticated input mask.
Caption
If the field you’re working on has a cryptic or hard-to-understand name, 
enter a more descriptive name in the Caption text box. The value in the 
Caption property appears as the column heading in Datasheet view, as a 
label on forms, and on reports in place of the field name. People entering 
data understand what to enter after reading the descriptive caption.
Default Value
When you know that the majority of records require a certain value, number, 
or abbreviation, enter it in the Default Value text box. That way, you save 
yourself the trouble of entering the value, number, or abbreviation most of 
the time because the default value appears already in each record when you 
enter it. You can always override the default value by entering something 
different.
Validation Rule
As long as you know your way around operators and Boolean expressions, 
you can establish a rule for entering data in a field. For example, you can 
enter an expression that requires dates to be entered in a certain time frame. 
Or you can require currency figures to be above or below a certain value. 
To establish a validation rule, enter an expression in the Validation Rule text 
box. To use dates in an expression, the dates must be enclosed by number 
signs (#). Here are some examples of validation rules:
>1000
The value you enter must be over 1000.
<1000
The value you enter must be under 1000.
>=10
The value you enter must be greater than or equal 
to ten.
<>0
The value you enter cannot be zero.
>=#1/1/2009#
The date you enter must be January 1, 2009, or 
later.
>=#1/1/2007# And 
<#1/1/2008#
The date you enter must be in the year 2007.

To get help forming expressions, click the three dots beside the Validation 
Rule text box to open the Expression Builder, shown in Figure 2-6, and build 
an expression there. Try clicking the Help button in the Expression Builder 
dialog box. Doing so opens the Access Help program, where you can get 
advice about building expressions.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Creating a 
validation 
rule.
 
Validation Text
If someone enters data that violates a validation rule that you enter in the 
Validation Rule text box, Access displays a standard error message. The 
message reads, “One or more values are prohibited by the validation rule set 
for [this field]. Enter a value that the expression for this field can accept.” If 
this message is too cold and impersonal for you, you can create a message 
of your own for the error message dialog box. Enter your friendly message in 
the Validation Text text box.
Required
By default, no entry has to be made in a field, but if you choose Yes instead 
of No in the Required box and you fail to make an entry in the field, a mes-
sage box tells you to be sure to make an entry.
Allow Zero Length
This property allows you to enter zero-length strings in a field. A zero-length 
string — two quotation marks with no text or spaces between them (“”) — 
indicates that no value exists for a field. To see how zero-length strings 
work, suppose that your database table calls for entering e-mail addresses. If 
you didn’t know whether one person has an e-mail address, you would leave 
the E-Mail Address field blank. If, however, you knew that the person didn’t 

550
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
have an e-mail address, you could indicate as much by entering a zero-length 
string. Choose Yes on the drop-down list to permit zero-length strings to be 
entered in the field.
Indexed
Indicates that the field has been indexed. As “Indexing for Faster Sorts, 
Searches, and Queries” explains later in this chapter, indexes make sorting 
a field and searching through a field go faster. The word No appears in this 
text box if the field has not been indexed.
Unicode Expression
Choose Yes from the Unicode Expression drop-down list if you want to com-
press data that is now stored in Unicode format. Storing data this way saves 
on hard drive space, and you probably don’t want to change this property.
Smart Tags
If you intend to enter Smart Tags in the field, indicate which kind you enter 
by clicking the three dots next to the Smart Tags box and choosing an option 
in the Action Tags dialog box.
Text Align
This property determines how the text is aligned in a column or on a form or 
report. Select General to let Access determine the alignment, or select Left, 
Right, Center, or Distribute.
Text Format
Available on Memo fields, this drop-down list lets you choose to allow rich 
text in the field. With this property set to Rich Text, you can make different 
words bold, italic, underline, and change font sizes and colors. Set it to Plain 
Text for plain, boring text with no formatting. I wonder why that isn’t the set-
ting’s name.
Append Only
Available on Memo fields, this lets you add data only to a Memo field to col-
lect a history of comments.
Show Date Picker
Available on Date/Time fields, choosing For Dates places a button next to the 
column that data-entry clerks can click to open a calendar and select a date 
instead of typing numbers.

551
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
Creating a lookup data-entry list
Perhaps the best way to make sure that data is entered correctly is to create 
a data-entry drop-down list. Whoever enters the data in your database table 
has only to choose an item from the list, as shown in Figure 2-7. This saves 
time and prevents invalid data from being entered. Access offers two ways 
to create the drop-down list:
 
Figure 2-7: 
A so-called 
lookup list.
 
 
✦ Create the list by entering the items yourself: Go this route when 
you’re dealing with a finite list of items that never change.
 
✦ Get the items from another database table: Go this route to get items 
from a column in another database table. This way, you can choose from 
an ever-expanding list of items. When the number of items in the other 
database table changes, so does the number of items in the drop-down 
list because the items come from the other database table. This is a 
great way to get items from a primary key field in another table.
Creating a drop-down list on your own
Follow these steps to create a drop-down, or lookup, list with entries you 
type:
 
1. In Design view, click the field that needs a drop-down list.
 
2. Open the Data Type drop-down list and choose Lookup Wizard, the 
last option in the list.
 
 The Lookup Wizard dialog box appears.

552
Field Properties for Making Sure That Data Entries Are Accurate
 
3. Select the second option, I Will Type in the Values That I Want, and 
click the Next button.
 
4. Under Col1 in the next dialog box, enter each item you want to appear 
in the drop-down list; then click the Next button.
 
 You can create a multicolumn list by entering a number in the Number 
of Columns text box and then entering items for the list.
 
5. Enter a name for the field, if necessary, and click the Finish button.
 
 Switch to Datasheet view and open the drop-down list in the field to 
make sure that it displays properly.
To remove a lookup list from a field, select the field, go to the Lookup tab in 
the Design view window, and choose Text Box on the Display Control drop-
down list.
 
To see what’s on a drop-down list, select the field for which you created the 
list, switch to Design view, and select the Lookup tab in the Field Properties 
pane. As shown in Figure 2-8, you can edit the list by editing or remov-
ing items in the Row Source text box. Be sure that a semicolon (;) appears 
between each item.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Lookup field 
properties.
 
Getting list items from a database table
Before you can get list items from another database table, you might want 
to define a relationship between the tables; it’s not required, but it’s recom-
mended. Later in this chapter, “Establishing Relationships between Database 
Tables” explains how to do that. Follow these steps to get items in a drop-
down list from another database table:
 
1. In Design view, click the field that needs a list, open the Data Type 
drop-down list, and choose Lookup Wizard.
 
 The Lookup Wizard dialog box appears.
 
2. Select the first option, I Want the Lookup Field to Get the Values from 
Another Table or Query, and click Next.
 
 You see a list of tables in your database.

3. Select the table with the data you need and click the Next button.
 
 The dialog box shows you a list of available fields in the table.
 
4. Select the field where the data for your list is stored.
 
5. Click the > button.
 
 The name of the list appears on the right side of the dialog box, under 
Selected Fields.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 Normally, lists are displayed in ascending order, but you can select 
a field and click the Ascending button to reverse the order of the list. 
(Note that the button turns into the Descending button.)
 
7. Click the Finish button.
 
 If you’re so inclined, you can change the width of the list before clicking 
Finish, but you can always do that on the datasheet, as Chapter 3 of this 
mini-book explains.
 
Suppose that you obtain the items from the wrong field or wrong database 
table? To fix that problem, select the field for which you created the list, 
and in Design view, select the Lookup tab (refer to Figure 2-8). Choose Text 
Box rather than Combo Box on the Display Control drop-down list and start 
all over.
Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries
Indexing means to instruct Access to keep information about the data in a 
field or combination of fields. Because Access keeps this information on 
hand, it doesn’t have to actually search through every record in a data-
base table to sort data, search for data, or run a query. In a large database 
table, indexes make sorting, searching, and querying go considerably faster 
because Access looks through its own data rather than the data in tables. 
The performance difference between querying a database table that has and 
has not been indexed is astonishing. That’s the good news. The bad news is 
that indexes inflate the size of Access files.
By default, the field you choose as the primary key field is indexed. I recom-
mend choosing other fields for indexing if you often conduct queries and 
searches. When you choose a field to index, choose one with data that varies 
from record to record and is likely to be the subject of searches, sorts, and 
queries. That way, the index means something. However, a field with data 
that is mostly the same from record to record is a waste of a good index, not 
to mention hard drive space. By the way, Access automatically indexes fields 
whose names include the words ID, Code, Num, and Key, the idea being that 
these fields are likely to store essential information worthy of indexing.

554
Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries
Indexing a field
To index a field, switch to Design view, select the field you want to index, 
and on the General tab of the Field Properties part of the Design window, 
open the Indexed drop-down list and choose one of these options:
 
✦ Yes (Duplicates OK): Indexes the field and allows duplicate values to be 
entered in the field.
 
✦ Yes (No Duplicates): Indexes the field and disallows duplicate values. 
If you choose this option, the field works something like a primary key 
field in that Access does not permit you to enter the same value in two 
different records.
Indexing based on more than one field
An index created on more than one field is called a multifield index. Multifield 
indexes make sorting, querying, and searching the database table go faster. 
They are especially valuable in sorting operations where records in one field 
are usually the same but records in a companion field are different. In a large 
database table that stores names and addresses, for example, many names 
in the Last Name field are the same, so indexing on the Last Name field isn’t 
worthwhile, but indexing the First Name and Last Name fields helps Access 
distinguish records from one another.
Follow these steps to generate a multifield index:
 
 1. Switch to Design view, and on the (Table Tools) Design tab, click the 
Indexes button.
 
 You see the Indexes dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-9. The dialog box 
lists the primary key field already because it’s indexed by default. You 
also see any fields to which you set the Indexed property to Yes.

2. On a blank line in the dialog box, enter a name for the index in the 
Index Name column.
 
3. In the Field Name column, open the drop-down list and choose the 
first field you want for the multifield index.
 
 Access sorts the records first on this field and then on the second field 
you choose.
 
4. In the next row, leave the Index Name blank and choose another field 
name from the drop-down list.
 
 This field is the second field in the index. You can use as many as ten 
different fields in a multifield index. In Figure 2-9, two fields are in a mul-
tifield index: First Name and Last Name.
 
5. Choose Descending in the Sort Order column if you want the field 
sorted in descending order.
 
 Most of the time, you want leave the Sort Order set to Ascending 
because most people read from A to Z.
 
6. Click the Close button.
 
 Click the Indexes button in Design view if you need to return to the 
Indexes dialog box and change how fields are indexed.
Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
As Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains, you have to establish relationships 
between tables if you want to query or generate reports with data from more 
than one database table. Relationships define the field that two different 
tables have in common. To understand why relationships between tables 
are necessary, consider the query shown in Figure 2-10. The purpose of this 
query is to list all companies that ordered items in 2009, list the companies 
by name, and list the city and country where each company is located.
Consider what Access does to run this query:
 
✦ Access deals with two database tables, Customers and Orders.
 
✦ In the Orders table, Access looks in the Order Date field to isolate all 
records that describe orders made in the year 2009. The expression 
for finding these records is shown on the Criteria line in Figure 2-10: 
Between #1/1/2009# And #12/31/2009#.
 
✦ Because there is a relationship between the ID field in the Customers 
table and the Customer ID field in the Orders table — because the two 
fields hold the same type of information — Access can match the 2009 
records it finds in the Orders table with corresponding records in the 
Customers table. Where the Customer ID of a 2009 record in the Orders 
table and an ID in the Customers table match, Access assembles a new 
record and places it in the query results.

556
Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
 
✦ Data for determining which records appear in the query results is found in 
the Order Date field in the Orders table. But the information compiled in 
the query results — customer IDs, company names, cities, and countries — 
comes from fields in the Customers table. Thanks to the relationship 
between the ID and Customer ID fields in these tables, Access can draw 
upon information from both tables.

a query with 
more than 
one table,

Types of relationships
The vast majority of relationships between tables are one-to-many relation-
ships between the primary key field in one database table and a field in 
another. Table relationships fall in these categories:
 
✦ One-to-many relationship: Each record in one table is linked to many 
records in another table. The relationship in Figure 2-10 is a one-to-many 
relationship. Each ID number appears only once in the ID field of the 
Customers table, but in the Orders table, the same Customer ID number 
can appear in many records because the same customer can order many 
different products. When you link tables, Access creates a one-to-many

Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
relationship when one of the fields being linked is either a primary key 
field or an indexed field assigned the No (No Duplicates) setting. (See 
“Indexing for Faster Sorts, Searches, and Queries,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
✦ One-to-one relationship: Two fields are linked. This relationship is rare 
and is sometimes used for security purposes.
 
✦ Many-to-many relationship: This complex relationship actually 
describes crisscrossing relationships in which the linking field is not the 
primary key field in either table. To create a many-to-many relationship, 
an intermediary table called a junction table is needed. This relationship 
is rare.
 
Sometimes, fields in separate tables that hold the same data also have the 
same name, but that isn’t necessary. For example, a field called ZIP Code in 
one table might be called Postal Code in another. What matters is that fields 
that are linked have the same data type. For example, you can’t create a rela-
tionship between a text field and a number field.
Handling tables in the Relationships window
 
 To display the tables in a database and link tables to one another or see 
how they’re related to each other, go to the Database Tools tab and click 
the Relationships button. You see the Relationships window, as shown in 
Figure 2-11. Notice the field names in each table. The primary key field is 
shown with a picture of a key next to it. Lines in the window show how 
relationships have been established between tables.
The first time you open the Relationships 
window, you see the Show Table dialog box. 
Use this dialog box to tell Access which tables 
to put in the Relationships window. Ctrl+click 
to select tables and then click the Add button.
If you create a new database table and  
want to place it in the Relationships window, 
click the Relationships button to display the 
Relationships window; then click the Show 
Table button on the (Relationship Tools) Design 
tab. The Show Table dialog box appears. Select 
your new table and click the Add button.

Apart from linking tables in the Relationships window (a subject I explain 
shortly), use these techniques on the (Relationship Tools) Design tab to 
handle tables:
 
✦ Repositioning and resizing the tables: Each table appears in its own 
window. Drag tables from place to place, drag a border to change a win-
dow’s size, and scroll to see field names.
 
 
✦ Removing a table from the window: Select the table and click the Hide 
Table button.
 
 
✦ Removing all tables from the window: Click the Clear Layout button 
and choose Yes in the confirmation box.
 
 
✦ Placing tables back on the window: Click the Show Table button, and in 
the Show Table dialog box, select the tables and click the Add button.
 
 
✦ Placing all tables back in the window: To put all the tables with rela-
tionships back in the window, click the All Relationships button.
 
 
✦ Studying a table’s relationships: Click the Clear Layout button to 
remove all tables from the window; then place the table back in the 
window, select it, and click the Direct Relationships button. All tables 
that are related to the selected table are added to the layout.

To generate and print an Access report that shows how tables in your data-
base are linked, go to the (Relationship Tools) Design tab and click the 
Relationship Report button. Then save the report and print it. Chapter 5 of 
this mini-book explains reports.
Forging relationships between tables
On the (Relationship Tools) Design tab (refer to Figure 2-11), make sure that 
both tables are on display and then follow these steps to forge a relationship 
between them:
 
1. Click to select the field in one table; then hold down the mouse 
button, drag the pointer to the field in the other table where you want 
to forge the link, and release the mouse button.
 
 You see the Edit Relationships dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-12. This 
dragging between table fields is probably the most awkward thing you 
undertake in Office 2010! If you do it right, a bar appears where the 
pointer is while you move it over the second table, and the names of the 
two fields appear in the Edit Relationships dialog box.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Creating 
a table 
relationship.
 
 
 Notice the Relationship Type at the bottom of the dialog box. If you acci-
dentally create a link to the wrong field, choose the correct field from 
the drop-down list in the dialog box.
 
2. Select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box.
 
 If you don’t select this box, the relationship between the tables is inde-
terminate, instead of being a one-to-many relationship. Referential integ-
rity (another hideous database term!) has to do with whether values in 
the two different fields corroborate each other.

560
Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
 
3. Select Cascade options if you so choose.
 
 One of these options is excellent, and the other is dangerous:
 
• Cascade Update Related Fields: If you change a value on the “one” 
side of the relationship, a matching value on the “many” side 
changes as well to preserve referential integrity. For example, if you 
create a multifield primary key of First Name and Last Name and 
then change the name of someone, the related fields in the other 
table change automatically to preserve referential integrity. This is 
a great way to make sure that information is up-to-date.
 
• Cascade Delete Related Records: If you delete a record in the “one” 
table, all records in the “many” table to which the deleted record 
is linked are also deleted. For example, if you delete an employee 
from the “one” table, all records in the “many” table that include that 
employee are deleted! Access warns you before making the deletion, 
but still! This option is dangerous, and I don’t recommend selecting it.
 
4. Click the Create button to forge the relationship.
 
 In the Relationships window (refer to Figure 2-11), a line is drawn 
between the table fields. The number 1 appears on the “one” side of the 
relationship and the infinity symbol (∞) appears on the “many” side.
 
After you create a one-to-many relationship between tables with the Enforce 
Referential Integrity check box selected, you can’t enter a value in the 
“many” table unless it’s already in the “one” table. For example, suppose 
that the “one” table includes a primary key field called Employee Number, 
and this field is linked to a field in the “many” table that is also called 
Employee Number. If you enter an Employee Number in the “many” table 
that isn’t in the “one” table, Access warns you that it can’t be done without 
violating referential integrity. The best way to solve this problem is to create 
a lookup data-entry list in the “many” table with values from the primary key 
field in the “one” table. See “Creating a lookup data-entry list,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Editing table relationships
In the Relationships window (refer to Figure 2-11), select the line that repre-
sents the relationship between two database tables and follow these instruc-
tions to edit or remove the relationship:
 
 
✦ Editing the relationship: Click the Edit Relationships button or right-
click and choose Edit Relationship. You see the Edit Relationships dialog 
box, where you can overhaul the relationship (the previous topic in this 
chapter explains how).
 
✦ Deleting the relationship: Press the Delete key or right-click and choose 
Delete. Then select Yes in the confirmation box.

Establishing Relationships between Database Tables
In Datasheet view, Access gives you the oppor-
tunity to view the “many” records that are 
linked to a field when a relationship is estab-
lished between tables. The records appear on 
a subdatasheet. In the database shown in this 
illustration, the Orders and Order Details tables 
are linked on the Order ID field — the primary 
key of the Orders table and the “one” side of 
the relationship. In the Order Details table, I 
can click the plus sign (+) in a record to see the 
“many” records that are linked to Order ID, the 
primary key field. For this illustration, I clicked 
the plus sign to see the details for Order 31. The 
information on the subdatasheet comes from 
the Order Details table. Click the minus sign (–) 
to hide a subdatasheet.

Chapter 3: Entering the Data
In This Chapter
✓ Entering data on a datasheet
✓ Changing the look of a datasheet
✓ Creating a form for entering data
✓ Finding records in a field or database table
✓ Finding and replacing your data
A
t last — you can start entering the data. If you set up your database 
tables, named the fields, and established relationships between the 
tables, you’re ready to go. This short chapter explains how to enter the 
data in a database table. It shows you how to enter data on a datasheet or 
enter data by way of a form. This chapter also describes how to find missing 
records in case one goes astray.
There’s no getting around it: Entering data is truly a tedious activity. But 
if you set up the fields well and take advantage of input masks and other 
field properties, it isn’t so bad. It’s better than stepping on a shovel blade, 
anyway.
The Two Ways to Enter Data
When it comes to entering data in a database table, you can take your pick 
between Datasheet view and a form. Figure 3-1 compares and contrasts the 
two. Here are the advantages of entering data in Datasheet view:
 
✦ Many records appear simultaneously.
 
✦ You can compare data easily between records.
 
✦ You can sort by column with the commands in the Sort and Filter group 
on the Home tab (as discussed in Chapter 4 of this mini-book).
 
✦ You can scroll up or down to locate records.
Here are the advantages of entering the data in a form:
 
✦ You don’t have to scroll left or right to see all the fields.
 
✦ Getting from field to field is easier.
 
✦ Fields are clearly labeled so that you always know what to enter.

564
Entering the Data in Datasheet View

view (left) 
and in a 
form (right).
 
Entering the Data in Datasheet View
Entering data in Datasheet view is like entering data in a conventional table. 
As with a table, a datasheet has columns and rows. Records are entered in 
rows, and each column represents a field. Fans of Datasheet view like being 
able to look at a dozen records simultaneously. They like being able to open 
subdatasheets. (Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains what those are.) For 
fans of Datasheet view, these pages explain how to enter data in a datasheet 
and change a datasheet’s appearance.
 
 Database tables open in Datasheet view when you double-click their names 
in the Navigation pane. But if you happen to be gazing at a table in Design 
view, click the View command on the Home tab or the Datasheet View 
button on the status bar.
Entering data
In Datasheet view, the bottom of the window tells you how many records are 
entered in the database table and which record the cursor is in. To enter a 
new record, move to a new, empty row and start entering the data. To create 
a new row, do one of the following:

✦ On the Home tab, click the New button.
 
 
✦ Click the New (Blank) Record button in the Datasheet navigation but-

window.
 
✦ Scroll to the bottom of the Datasheet view window and begin typing in 
the row with an asterisk (*) next to it.
 
✦ Press Ctrl++ (the plus key).
A pencil icon appears on the row selector to let you know which record 
you’re dealing with. To get from field to field, click in a field, press the Tab 
key, or press Enter. Table 3-1 lists keyboard shortcuts for getting around in a 
datasheet.

 To delete a record, click its row selector and press the Delete key or the 
Delete button (located on the Home tab). You can also click in a record, go 
to the (Table Tools) Fields tab, and click the Delete button there.
Two tricks for entering data quicker
In a database table with many fields, it’s sometimes hard to tell what data to 
enter. When the pointer is in the sixth or seventh field, for example, you can 
lose sight of the first field, the one on the left side of the datasheet that usu-
ally identifies the person or item whose record you’re entering.

566
Entering the Data in Datasheet View
To freeze a field so that it appears on-screen no matter how far you travel 
toward the right side of the datasheet, right-click the column’s heading and 
choose Freeze Fields on the shortcut menu. To unfreeze the fields, right-click 
the column heading and choose Unfreeze All Fields on the shortcut menu. 
You can freeze more than one field by dragging across field names at the top 
of the datasheet before choosing to freeze the columns. Is it getting cold in 
here?
Another way to handle the problem of not being able to identify where data 
is supposed to be entered is to hide columns in the datasheet. To perform 
this trick, select the columns you want to hide by dragging the pointer 
across their names; then right-click the column heading and choose Hide 
Fields on the shortcut menu. To see the columns again, right-click any 
column heading and choose Unhide Fields on the shortcut menu. You see 
the Unhide Columns dialog box. Select the fields that you want to see on the 
datasheet.
 
The fastest way to hide a column is to drag the border between it and the 
next column to the left until the column disappears.
Changing the appearance of the datasheet
To make the datasheet a little less cluttered and unwieldy, try experimenting 
with its appearance. Access offers a few handy shortcuts for doing just that:
 
✦ Rearranging columns: To move a column to a different location, click its 
name at the top of the datasheet and drag it to the left or right.
To make putting a long entry in a field a little 
easier, Access offers the Zoom box. Instead 
of having to stay within the narrow confines 
of a datasheet field, you can press Shift+F2 to 
open the Zoom box and enter the data there. 
After you click OK, the data is entered in the 
field. The Zoom box is especially convenient for 
entering data in a Memo field. As Chapter 2 in 
this mini-book explains, Memo fields can hold a 
whopping 65,535 characters. Move the cursor 
into a field and press Shift+F2 to open the Zoom 
box and read all the text in the field.
Entering data in the Zoom box

Entering the Data in a Form
 
✦ Resizing columns: Move the pointer between column names at the 
top of the datasheet, and when you see the double-headed arrow, click 
and start dragging. To make a column just large enough to fit its widest 
entry, move the pointer between column names and double-click when 
you see the double-headed arrow.
 
✦ Changing fonts: The default font for a datasheet is Calibri 11-point, but 
the Home tab offers commands for changing fonts and font sizes. Look 
for these commands in the Text Formatting group.
 
 
✦ Changing the look of gridlines: On the Home tab, open the drop-down 
list on the Gridlines button and choose options to change the number 
and thickness of gridlines.
 
 
✦ Alternate row colors: Open the drop-down list on the Alternate Row 
Color button and choose a color for alternating rows on the datasheet.
To experiment all at one time with the many options for changing a data-
sheet’s appearance, go to the Home tab and click the Text Formatting group 
button. You see the Datasheet Formatting dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2. 
If you want a customized look for all the datasheets you work on, click the 
File tab and select Options. Then go to the Datasheet category in the Options 
dialog box and go to town.
 
Figure 3-2: 
The 
Datasheet 
Formatting 
dialog box.
 
Entering the Data in a Form
Forms like the one shown in Figure 3-3 are very convenient for entering data. 
The labels tell you exactly what to enter. Personally, I prefer entering data in 
a form to entering data on a datasheet. On a form, you take it one step — 
make that one record — at a time. Not looking at a dozen records makes 
the task of entering data a little easier. These pages explain how to create a 
form for entering information in a database table. You also get tried-and-true 
advice for moving around with the Navigation buttons.

568
Entering the Data in a Form
 
Figure 3-3: 
A form.
 
Creating a form
 
 Fortunately, the Form Wizard makes it very simple to create a form for enter-
ing information in a database table. All you have to do is start the wizard, 
choose the table, and make a couple of design decisions. To create a form, 
go to the Create tab and click the Form Wizard button. You see the first of 
several Form Wizard dialog boxes. Answer these questions and keep clicking 
the Next button until the time comes to click Finish:
 
✦ Tables/Queries: From the drop-down list, choose the name of the data-
base table you need to enter data in.
 
✦ Selected Fields: Click the >> button to enter all the field names in the 
Select Fields box.
 
✦ Layout: Select the Columnar option button. The other layouts aren’t 
much good for entering data in a table. If you choose Tabular or 
Datasheet, you may as well enter data straight into the datasheet rather 
than rely on a form.
 
✦ Title: Name your form after the table you created it for so that you can 
identify the form easily in the Navigation pane.
To delete a form, right-click its name in the Navigation pane and choose 
Delete on the shortcut menu.

Finding a Missing Record
Entering the data
To open a form and begin entering data in its database table, display the 
form’s name in the Navigation pane and then double-click the form’s name. 
You can also right-click the name of the form and choose Open.
 
To enter data in a form, click the New (Blank) Record button. This button 
is located with the Navigation buttons at the bottom of the form window. A 
new, empty form appears. Start typing. Press the Tab key, press the Enter 
key, or click to move from field to field. You can move backward through the 
fields by pressing Shift+Tab. If you enter half a record and want to start over, 
press the Esc key to empty the current field. Press Esc again to empty all the 
fields.
The Navigation buttons at the bottom of the form window tell you how many 
records are in the database table and which record you’re looking at. From 
left to right, the Navigation buttons take you to the first record, previous 
record, next record, and last record.
Finding a Missing Record
Sometimes data goes astray. You scroll through a datasheet but simply can’t 
find the item or record you need so bad. For times like those, Access offers the 
Find command. Use the command to scour a database for errant information.
 
 Open the database table with the data that needs finding. If you know in 
which field the data is located, click in the field. You can save a little time 
that way. Then, on the Home tab, click the Find button (or press Ctrl+F). You 
see the Find and Replace dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4. Fill in the dialog 
box as follows:
 
Figure 3-4: 
Finding 
data.
 
 
✦ Find What: Enter the item you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a null 
value, enter null in this text box. Enter “” (two double-quotation marks) 
to find zero-length strings. Table 3-2 describes the wildcard characters 
you can use in searches.

570
Finding a Missing Record
 
✦ Look In: If you clicked in a field before choosing the Find command, 
Current Field is selected in this box. To search the entire database table, 
choose Current Document on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Match: Choose the option that describes what you know about the item. 
Choosing the Any Part of Field option can make for a long search. For 
example, a search for the letters chin finds, among others, China, Ching, 
and itching — any word with the consecutive letters chin.
 
✦ Search: Choose an option — All, Up, or Down — that describes which 
direction to start searching.
 
✦ Match Case: If you know the combination of upper- and lowercase let-
ters you’re after and you enter the combination in the Find What text 
box, select this check box.
 
✦ Search Fields As Formatted: If you’re searching for a field that has 
been formatted a certain way, select this check box and make sure that 
the text or numbers you enter in the Find What text box are formatted 
correctly. For example, if you’re searching for a record with the date 
July 31, 1958, and you choose the mm/dd/yyyy format, enter the date as 
07/31/1958.
Click the Find Next button to conduct the search. The item might be found in 
more than one location. Keep clicking Find Next (or pressing Alt+F) until you 
find the item or you die of thirst on the hot sands of the digital desert.

Finding and Replacing Data
 
To quickly find the first value of a search term, start typing in the Search box 
in the form window or in Datasheet view. As soon as you start typing, the 
cursor moves to the first instance of the data you enter.
Finding and Replacing Data
Finding and replacing data is remarkably similar to finding data. The differ-
ence is that you enter data in the Replace With text box as well as the famil-
iar Find What text box and other option boxes. Figure 3-5 shows the Replace 
tab of the Find and Replace dialog box. Does it look familiar? If it doesn’t, 
read the preceding topic in this chapter.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Replacing 
data.
 
 
 To find and replace data, go to the Home tab and click the Replace button 
(or press Ctrl+H). You see the Replace tab of the Find and Replace dialog 
box. After you enter the replacement data in the Replace With text box, 
make sure that Whole Field is selected in the Match drop-down list. 
Conducting a find-and-replace operation with Any Part of Field or Start of 
Field selected in the Match drop-down list can have unintended conse-
quences. For example, a search for Brook also finds Brooklyn, Middlebrook, 
and other words that include brook. Blindly replacing the brook text string 
with stream produces, for example, Streamlyn and Middlestream.
 
Unless you’re as confident as a gambler with four aces, don’t click the 
Replace All button to replace all instances of the text or numbers in the data-
base table or field you’re searching in. Instead, click the Replace button to 
find and replace text or numbers one instance at a time.
 
You can also find and replace data with an update query. Chapter 4 of this 
mini-book covers update queries.

Chapter 4: Sorting, Querying, 
and Filtering for Data
In This Chapter
✓ Sorting, or rearranging, records in a database table
✓ Filtering records in a table to see only the records you need
✓ Querying to collect and examine information stored in a database
✓ Looking at different kinds of queries
N
ow that you’ve laid the groundwork, you can put your database 
through its paces and make it do what databases are meant to do — 
provide information of one kind or another. This chapter explains how to 
pester a database for names, addresses, dates, statistical averages, and 
what not. It shows how to sort records and filter a database table to see 
records of a certain kind. You also find out how to query a database to get it 
to yield its dirty little secrets and invaluable information.
Sorting Records in a Database Table
Sorting rearranges records in a database table (or subdatasheet) so that 
the records appear in alphabetical, numerical, or date order in one field. 
By sorting the records in a database, you can locate records faster. What’s 
more, being able to sort data means that you don’t have to bother about the 
order in which you enter records because you can always sort them later to 
put them in a particular order.
Ascending versus descending sorts
Records can be sorted in ascending or descending order:
 
✦ Ascending order: Arranges records in alphabetical order from A to Z, 
numbers from smallest to largest, and dates chronologically from earli-
est to latest.
 
✦ Descending order: Arranges text from Z to A, numbers from largest to 
smallest, and dates chronologically from latest to earliest.

Follow these steps to sort the records in a database table:
 
1. In Datasheet view, click anywhere in the field by which you want to 
sort the records.
 
 2. On the Home tab, click the Ascending or Descending button.
 
 You can also right-click a field name at the top of a column and choose 
Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A on the shortcut menu. The menu choices 
change based on the type of data. For Number fields, you can sort small-
est to largest and vice versa; for Date fields, choose to sort oldest to 
newest, or vice versa.
 
You can sort on more than one field by clicking a field and sorting it, and 
then clicking a second field and sorting it. Just make sure that you sort the 
fields in reverse order. For example, to sort the database by the Employee, 
Customer, and Order ID fields, click in Order ID and sort it in ascending 
order; click in Customer and sort it in ascending order; click in Employee 
and sort it in ascending order. If you mess up and forget how the table is 
sorted, click the Remove Sort button. This button is located on the Home tab 
underneath the Sort A to Z and Sort Z to A buttons.
Filtering to Find Information
Filtering isolates all the records in a database table that have the same field 
values or nearly the same field values. Instead of all the records in the table 
appearing on the datasheet, only records that meet the filtering criteria 
appear, as shown in Figure 4-1.

Filtering to Find Information
The basic idea behind filtering is to choose a field value in the database 
table and use it as the standard for finding or excluding records. For exam-
ple, you can find all the orders for a particular customer, all orders taken 
in the month of April, or all the orders that a particular customer placed in 
April. For that matter, you can filter by exclusion and see the records of all 
the orders in a database table not taken in April and not for a particular cus-
tomer. Filtering is useful when you need to find records with specific infor-
mation in a single database table.
Different ways to filter a database table
Here are shorthand descriptions of the four ways to filter a database table. 
All filtering operations begin in Datasheet view on the Home tab. These tech-
niques are described in detail in the upcoming pages.
 
 
✦ Filter by Selection: Select all or part of a field in the database table, click 
the Selection button, and choose a filtering option. Access isolates all 
records with the data you select. This method works best when you 
can’t quite decide what you’re looking for. It’s the only filtering method 
that permits you to look for data found in a whole field or part of a field. 
You can also filter data that doesn’t match the selection.
 
 
✦ Filter for Input: Select the field you want to filter with and click the 
Filter button. A dialog box appears so that you can choose values in the 
field or enter comparison operators to describe the numeric or date 
values you are filtering for. With this technique, you can filter for data 
ranges.
The biggest difference between filtering and 
querying is that you can save a query and call 
upon it more than once. Queries are kept at 
the ready in the Navigation pane. A filter, on 
the other hand, is as good as the first time you 
use it, although you can save and run it as a 
query. Filters apply to a single database table, 
whereas you can query to assemble informa-
tion from more than one table. In the results 
of a query, you can include as many fields as 
you want, but the results of a filtering opera-
tion show all the fields in the database table, 
whether you want them or not.
When it comes to examining data, a query is 
more sophisticated than a filter. Although you 
can use standard comparison operators to 
find records by filtering, querying gives you 
the opportunity to use complex expressions as 
well as comparison operators. You can filter, 
for example, to find people whose income is 
greater than or less than a certain amount. 
However, because you can write expressions 
in queries, you can query to find people whose 
income falls within a certain range.

Filtering to Find Information
 
 
✦ Filter by Form: Click the Advanced button and choose Filter by Form. 
You see a form with one drop-down list for each field in your table. From 
the drop-down lists, make choices to describe the records you’re look-
ing for and then click the Toggle Filter button. This method is more flexi-
ble than the others because you can conduct OR as well as AND filtering 
operations. For example, you can isolate the records of people named 
Smith who also live in California, or the people who live in California or 
New York.
 
 
✦ Advanced Filter/Sort: Click the Advanced button and choose Advanced 
Filter/Sort. The Filter window opens. Drag the name of the field you want 
to filter onto the grid. Then choose a Sort option and enter a search cri-
terion. This filtering technique has more in common with queries than 
filters. Truth be told, the Advanced Filter/Sort command is merely a way 
to query a single table.
 
After you filter a database table, you can run a second (or third or fourth) 
filter operation to filter the data even more and further isolate the data you 
are looking for.
“Unfiltering” a database table
 
You can tell when you’re looking at a database table that has been filtered 
instead of a database table with all its records because the word Filtered 
appears at the bottom of the window next to the Navigation buttons (refer to 
Figure 4-1). Moreover, the filter icon appears in the field names of columns 
used in the filter operation and the Toggle Filter button on the Ribbon is 
highlighted.
When you have finished filtering a database table, use one of these tech-
niques to “unfilter” it and see all the records in the table again:
 
✦ Click the word Filtered at the bottom of the window. You can click this 
word again or click the Toggle Filter button to repeat the filter operation.
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Toggle Filter button. You can click this 
button again to repeat the filter operation.
 
 
✦ On the Home tab, click the Advanced button and choose Clear All Filters 
on the drop-down list. Choosing this option kills the filter operation; you 
can’t repeat it except by reconstructing it in the Datasheet window.
Filtering by selection
Filtering by selection is the fastest way to filter a database table. It’s also 
the best way when you’re not sure what you’re looking for, because you can 
search for partial words and phrases. Follow these steps to filter by selection:

Filtering to Find Information
 
1. Display the database table that needs filtering in Datasheet view.
 
2. Tell Access how to filter the records.
 
 To find all records with the same value or text in a particular field, 
simply click in a field with the value or text. If you aren’t quite sure what 
to look for, select part of a field. For example, to find all names that start 
with the letters St, select St in one of the name fields.
 
 3. On the Home tab, click the Selection button and choose a filtering 
option.
 
 The options you see are specific to the cell you clicked or the data you 
selected in Step 2. For example, if you click a Last Name field that con-
tains the name Smith, your options include Equals “Smith” and Does Not 
Contain “Smith.” Select an option to include or exclude records in the 
filter operation.
Filtering for input
Filtering for input gives you the advantage of being able to filter for data 
ranges. Use this technique to isolate records that fall within a numerical or 
date range. Follow these steps to filter for input:
 
1. Display the database table that you want to filter in Datasheet view.
 
2. Select the field with the data you want to use for the filter operation.
 
 3. On the Home tab, click the Filter button.
 
 
 As shown in Figure 4-2, a dialog box appears so that you can describe 
the records you want to filter for. You can also open this dialog box by 
clicking the button to the right of a field name.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Filtering by 
input for 
numeric 
data values.

Filtering to Find Information
 
4. Tell Access how to filter the database table.
 
 You can choose values or describe a data range:
 
• Choose values in the field: The dialog box lists all values in the field. 
Deselect the Select All check box and then click to select the values 
you want to filter with.
 
• Describe a numeric or date range: Choose Number Filters or Date 
Filters and select a comparison operator on the submenu (refer to 
Figure 4-2). The Custom Filter dialog box appears. Enter a compari-
son value and click OK.
You can repeat Steps 2 through 4 to filter the database table even further.
Filtering by form
Filtering by form is a sophisticated filtering method. It permits you to filter in 
more than one field using an OR search. For example, you can tell Access to 
look in the Last Name field for people named Martinez, as well as look in the 
City field for Martinezes who live in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Moreover, 
you can use comparison operators in the filter operation. Follow these steps 
to filter by form:
 
 1. In Datasheet view, go to the Home tab, click the Advanced button, and 
choose Filter by Form on the drop-down list.
 
 Only field names appear on the datasheet, as shown in Figure 4-3.

2. Click in a field, open its drop-down list, and enter a comparison value 
or select a value on the drop-down list.
 
 You can select a value on the drop-down list or, in Number and Currency 
fields, enter a comparison operator and a value. Table 4-1 explains the 
comparison operators.
 
3. If you want, enter more criteria for the filtering operation.
 
 You can enter values in other fields as well as filter more than once in 
the same field.
 
• Enter values in other fields: Open the drop-down list in a field and 
enter a comparison value or select a value on the drop-down list.
 
• Filter more than once in the same field: Select a field in which you 
already entered a search criterion. Then click the Or tab and either 
enter a comparison value or select a value from the drop-down list.
 
 When you click the Or tab, the search choices you made previously 
disappear from the screen. Don’t worry — Access remembers them 
on the Look For tab. You can click the Or tab again if you want to 
enter more criteria for Or searching.
 
 4. Click the Toggle Filter button.
 
 The results of the filtering operation appear in the datasheet.

Querying: The Basics
Querying: The Basics
Querying means to ask a question of a database and get an answer in the 
form of records that meet the query criteria. Query when you want to ask a 
detailed question of a database. “Who lives in Los Angeles and donated more 
than $500 last year?” is an example of a query. So is “Which orders were 
purchased by people who live in California and therefore, have to pay sales 
tax, and how much sales tax was charged with these orders?” A query can 
search for information in more than one database table. For that matter, you 
can query other queries for information. A query can be as sophisticated or 
as simple as you need it to be. In the results of the query, you can show all 
the fields in a database table or only a few necessary fields.
Access offers several different ways to query a database (the different tech-
niques are described later in this chapter in “Six Kinds of Queries”). Still, 
no matter which kind of query you’re dealing with, the basics of creating 
and running a query are the same. You start on the Create tab to build new 
queries. To open a query you already created, double-click its name on 
the Navigation pane. The following pages introduce you to queries, how to 
create them, and how to modify them.
Creating a new query
To create a new query, start on the Create tab and click the Query Design or 
Query Wizard button.
 
 
✦ Create the query in Design view: Click the Query Design button to see 
the Query Design window, shown in Figure 4-4, as well as the Show Table 
dialog box for telling Access which database tables to query. Construct 
your query in the Design window (the following pages explain how).
 
 
✦ Create the query with a wizard: Click the Query Wizard button to dis-
play the New Query dialog box and then choose a wizard option (four 
possible Query Wizards are available) and answer the questions that the 
Query Wizard asks. You’re asked which table or tables to query, which 
fields to include in the query, and which fields to include in the query 
results (the following pages explain these issues).
 
 To run a query, open the query in the Query window, go to the (Query 
Tools) Design tab, and click the Run button. The results of the query appear 
in Datasheet view.

Viewing queries in Datasheet and Design view
Select a query on the Navigation pane and use these techniques to view it 
in Datasheet or Design view. Datasheet view shows the results of running a 
query. Create and modify queries in Design view.
 
✦ Opening in Design view: Right-click the query’s name in the Navigation 
pane and choose Design View on the shortcut menu.
 
✦ Opening in Datasheet view: On the Navigation pane, double-click the 
query’s name or right-click its name and choose Open on the shortcut 
menu.
 
  
 
 ✦ Switching between views with the View button: On the Home tab, click 
the View button. This button changes appearance, depending on 
whether you’re in Design view or Datasheet view.
 
✦ Switching between views on the status bar: Click the Datasheet View or 
Design View button on the right side of the status bar.
 
✦ Switching between views by right-clicking: Right-click the query’s title 
bar and choose Datasheet View or Design View.

582
Querying: The Basics
Finding your way around the Query Design window
The Query Design window (refer to Figure 4-4) is where you construct a 
query or retool a query you constructed already. Switch to Design view to 
see the Query Design window. You see this window straightaway after you 
click the Query Design button to construct a new query. The Query Design 
window is divided into halves:
 
✦ Table pane: Lists the database tables you’re querying as well as the 
fields in each table. You can drag the tables to new locations or drag a 
table border to change its size and view more fields.
 
✦ Design grid: Lists which fields to query from the tables, how to sort the 
query results, which fields to show in the query results, and criteria for 
locating records in fields.
Choosing which database tables to query
 
 To choose which database tables (and queries as well) to get information 
from, go to the (Query Tools) Design tab and click the Show Table button. 
You see the Show Table dialog box (refer to Figure 4-4). The Tables tab lists 
all the database tables you created for your database. Ctrl+click to select the 
tables you want to query and then click the Add button. To query a query, 
go to the Queries tab and select the query.
The tables and queries you choose appear in the Table pane of the Query 
Design window (refer to Figure 4-4). To remove a table from a query, right-
click it in the Table pane and choose Remove Table on the shortcut menu.
 
In order to query more than one table, you need to establish relationships 
between tables. (Chapter 2 of this mini-book has information about estab-
lishing relationships between database tables.) So-called join lines in the 
Query Design window show how the tables are related to one another.
 
If you haven’t defined relationships between the tables, you can still join 
them together by dragging a field from one table onto a field in another 
table. This is the same method used to create relationships between tables. 
Joining tables in a query doesn’t create an actual relationship; it’s just a tem-
porary join for the sake of the query.
Choosing which fields to query
After you choose which tables to query, the next step is to choose which 
fields to query from the tables you selected. The object is to list fields from 
the Table pane in the first row of the Design grid. Fields whose names you 
enter in the first row of the Design grid are the fields that produce query 
results, as demonstrated by Figure 4-5.

Sorting, Querying, and 
Filtering for Data
583
Querying: The Basics
 
Figure 4-5: 
How query

into query 
results.
 
Access offers these techniques for listing field names in the first row of the 
Design grid:
 
✦ Dragging a field name: Drag a field name into a column on the Design 
grid. The field name appears on the grid, as does the name of the table 
that you drag the field name from.
 
✦ Double-clicking a field name: Double-click a field name to place it in the 
next available column in the Design grid.
 
✦ Choosing a table and field name: Click in the Table row, open the drop-
down list, and choose the name of a table. Then, in the Field box directly 
above, open the drop-down list and choose a field name.
 
✦ Selecting all the fields in a table: In the unlikely event that you want all 
the fields from a table to appear in the query results, either double-click 
the asterisk (*) at the top of the list of field names or drag the asterisk 
into the Design grid. Access places the name of the table followed by 
an asterisk in the Field text box. The asterisk signifies that all the fields 
from the table are included in the query.
 
 To remove a field name from the Design grid, select it and press the Delete 
key or go to the (Query Tools) Design tab and click the Delete Columns 
button.
Sorting the query results
At the start of this chapter, “Sorting Records in a Database Table” explains 
what sorting is. The Sort row of the Design grid — directly underneath the 
Table name — contains a drop-down list. To sort the query, click the drop-
down list in a field and choose Ascending or Descending to sort the results 
of a query on a particular field. To sort the results on more than one field, 
make sure that the first field to be sorted appears to the left of the other 
fields. Access reads the sort order from left to right.

584
Querying: The Basics
Choosing which fields appear in query results
Although a field is part of a query and is listed in the Query grid, it isn’t 
always necessary to display information from the field in the query results. 
Consider the Query grid shown in Figure 4-6. The object of this query is 
to get a list of customers by ZIP Code that ordered products in the year 
2009. To that end, the query criteria cell in the Order Date field is Between 
#1/1/2009# And #12/31/2009#. However, when the query results are 
generated, listing the precise dates when the orders shipped isn’t necessary 
because the object of the query is to get a list of customers by ZIP code who 
ordered products in 2009.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Choosing 
what 
appears in

results.
 
Select or deselect to show a field’s data in the query results
The order in which field names appear in the 
Query grid is also the order in which they 
appear in the query results (refer to Figure 4-5). 
Follow these steps to put field columns in the 
right order in the Query grid:
 1. Click a column’s selector button to select 
a column.
 
 This button is the narrow gray box directly 
above the field name. The pointer turns 
into a downward-pointing arrow when you 
move it over the selector button.
 2. Click the selector button again and drag 
the column to the left or right.
Moving field columns on the Query grid

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sorting, Querying, and 
Filtering for Data
585
Querying: The Basics
Whether a field’s Show check box is selected in the Query grid determines 
if its results are part of the query results. Deselect the Show box if a field is 
necessary for producing records in a query but not necessary in the query 
results. By the way, after you save and reopen a query, Access moves dese-
lected Show fields to the right side of the Query grid, where you usually have 
to scroll to see them.
Entering criteria for a query
What separates a run-of-the-mill query from a supercharged query is a cri-
terion, an expression or value you enter on the Criteria line under a field. 
Enter criteria on the Criteria line of the Query grid. By entering criteria, 
you can pinpoint records in the database with great accuracy. In Figure 
4-7, the Query grid instructs Access to retrieve orders with invoices due 
before January 1, 2009, that charged more than $2000 and were shipped to 
Massachusetts (MA), Connecticut (CT), or New York (NY).
 
Figure 4-7: 
Including 
criteria in a 
query.
 
 
As Figure 4-7 shows, Access places double quotation marks (“”) around text 
criteria and number signs (#) around date criteria. When you enter text 
or date criteria, don’t enter the double quotation marks or number signs. 
Access enters them for you.
 
 When you need help writing an expression for a query, try clicking the 
Builder button to construct your query in the Expression Builder dialog box. 
This button is located on the (Query Tools) Design tab.

586
Querying: The Basics
Entering numeric criteria
Enter numeric criteria in Number and Currency fields when you want to iso-
late records with specific values. Earlier in this chapter, Table 4-1 describes 
comparison operators you can use for querying and filtering. These opera-
tors are invaluable when it comes to mining a database for information. 
Use the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators to find values higher or 
lower than a target value. Use the Between operator to find values between 
two numbers. For example, Between 62 And 55 in a Currency field isolates 
records with all items that sell for between $62.00 and $55.00.
 
Do not include commas in numbers when you enter them as criteria. For 
example, enter 3200, not 3,200. Enter a comma and you get a The expres-
sion you entered contains invalid syntax. . . error message.
Entering text criteria
To enter a text criterion, type it in the Criteria text box. For example, to find 
students who attended Ohio State University, enter Ohio State in the Criteria 
text box of the University field. Access places double quotation marks (“”) 
around the text you enter as soon when you move the pointer out of the 
Criteria text box.
Wildcards and the Not operator can come in very handy when entering text 
criteria:
 
✦ Wildcards: Wildcards make it possible to query for data whose spell-
ing you aren’t quite sure of. (In Chapter 3 of this mini-book, Table 3-2 
explains what the wildcard characters are and how to use them.) For 
example, entering Sm?th in the Criteria box of the Last Name field finds 
all Smiths and Smyths. Entering E* in the Company field finds all com-
pany names that begin with the letter E.
 
✦ Not operator: Use the Not operator to exclude records from query 
results. For example, to exclude records with Belgium in the Shipped To 
field, enter Not Belgium in the Criteria text box. This is a great way to 
strip unneeded records from a query.
Entering date criteria
All the operators that work for numeric data (refer to Table 4-1, earlier in 
this chapter) also work for data entered in a Date field. For example, enter 
>7/31/1958 in a Birth Date field to find all people born after (greater than) 
July 31, 1958. Enter Between 1/1/1920 And 12/31/1929 to retrieve data about 
people born in the Roaring Twenties.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sorting, Querying, and 
Filtering for Data
587
Six Kinds of Queries
Access places number signs (#) around date criteria after you enter it. You 
can enter dates in these formats:
 
✦ 11/22/10
 
✦ 11/22/2010
 
✦ 22-Nov-10
 
✦ November 22, 2010
 
For the purpose of entering two-digit years in dates, the digits 30 through 99 
belong to the 20th Century (1930–1999), but the digits 00 through 29 belong 
to the 21st Century (2000–2029). For example, >4/1/24 refers to April 1, 2024, 
not April 1, 1924. To enter a date in 1929 or earlier, enter four digits rather 
than two to describe the year: >4/1/1929. To enter a date in 2030, or later, 
enter four digits rather than two: >4/1/2038. To avoid any confusion, enter 
four-digit years all the time.
 
The Date() function can come in very handy when you want to retrieve data 
relative to today’s date, whatever it happens to be. For example, to retrieve 
purchase orders made between January 1, 2007, and today’s date, enter this 
expression: Between 1/1/2007 And Date().
At last — saving and running a query
To save a query and inscribe its name forever in the Navigation pane, click 
the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar and enter a descriptive name 
in the Save As dialog box. The name you enter appears in the Queries 
group in the Navigation pane.
After you laboriously construct your query, take it for a test drive. To run a 
query:
 
 
✦ Starting from the Query Design window: Click the Run button on the 
(Query Tools) Design tab.
 
 
✦ Starting from the Navigation pane: Double-click an existing query’s 
name, or right-click its name and choose Open on the shortcut menu.
Six Kinds of Queries
For your pleasure and entertainment, the rest of this chapter describes six 
useful types of queries. Access offers a handful of other queries, but I won’t 
go there. Those queries are pretty complicated. If you become adept at que-
rying, however, you’re invited to look into the Help system for advice about 
running the query types that aren’t explained here.

588
Six Kinds of Queries
Select query
 
 A select query is the standard kind of query, which I explain earlier in this 
chapter. A select query gathers information from one or more database 
tables and displays the information in a datasheet. A select query is the 
most common query, the primal query, the starting point for most other 
queries.
Top-value query
A top-value query is an easy way to find out, in a Number or Currency 
field, the highest or lowest values. On the Query grid, enter the name of 
the Number or Currency field you want to know more about; then choose 
Ascending in the Sort drop-down list to rank values from lowest to highest or 
Descending in the Sort drop-down list to rank values from highest to lowest. 
Finally, on the (Query Tools) Design tab, enter a value in the Return text box 
or choose a value on the Return drop-down list:
 
✦ Highest or lowest by percentage: Enter or choose a percentage to find, 
for example, the highest or lowest 25 percent of the values. To enter a 
percentage, type a percent sign (%) after your entry and press the Enter 
key.
 
✦ Highest or lowest by ranking number: Enter or choose a number to 
find, for example, the top-ten or lowest-ten values. Press the Enter key 
after you enter a number.
 
This may seem counterintuitive, but to see the top values, you have to 
sort the field you’re ranking in descending order. For example, if you sort 
employees by number of sales in descending order, the employees with 
the top sales appear at the top. To see the bottom values, sort in ascending 
order.
Summary query
Similar to a top-value query, a summary query is a way of getting cumulative 
information about all the data in a field. In a field that stores data about sales 
in Kentucky, for example, you can find the average amount of each sale, the 
total amount of all the sales, the total number of all the sales, and other data.
 
 To run a summary query, go to the (Query Tools) Design tab and click the 
Totals button. A new row called Total appears on the Query grid. Open 
the Total drop-down list in the field whose contents you want to summarize 
and choose a function. Table 4-2 describes the functions.

are for including fields you’re not performing a function on:
 
✦ Group By: For choosing which fields to show totals for.
 
✦ Expression: For creating a calculated field.
 
✦ Where: For setting criteria (you can’t include the field in the query).
Calculation query
A calculation query is one in which calculations are performed as part of the 
query. For example, you can calculate the sales tax on items sold or total the 
numbers in two fields in the same record. The beauty of a calculation query 
is that the data is recomputed each time you run the query. If the data used 
to make a calculation changes, so does the result of the calculation. If you 
were to include the calculation in a database table, you would have to recal-
culate the data yourself each time one of the values changed. With a calcula-
tion query, Access does the math for you.
To construct a calculation query, create a new field in the Query grid for 
storing the results of the calculation; then enter a name for the field and a 
formula for the calculation. Follow these steps to create a calculation query:
 
1. Create a query as you normally would and be sure to include the 
fields you want to use for calculation purposes in the Query grid.
 
2. In the Field box of a blank field, enter a name for the Calculation field 
and follow it with a colon.
 
 In Figure 4-8, I entered Subtotal:. The purpose of the new Subtotal field is 
to calculate the Unit Price × the Quantity.

3. After the colon, in square brackets ( [] ), enter the name of a field 
whose data you use for the calculation.
 
 In Figure 4-8, data from the Unit Price and Quantity fields are used in the 
calculation, so their names appear in square brackets: [Unit Price] and 
[Quantity]. Be sure to spell field names correctly so that Access can rec-
ognize them.
 
4. Complete the calculation.
 
 How you do this depends on what kind of calculation you’re making. In 
Figure 4-8, I entered an asterisk (*) to multiply two fields together. The 
equation multiplies the values in the Unit Price and Quantity fields. You 
can add the data from two different fields — including calculated fields — 
by putting their names in brackets and joining them with a plus sign, like 
so: [SubTotal]+[Shipping Cost].
 
Sometimes the results of the query aren’t formatted correctly on the 
datasheet. To assign a new format to a field you create for the purposes 
of making a calculation query, right-click the field on the Query grid and 
choose Properties. The Property Sheet appears. On the General tab, click 
the Format drop-down list and choose the correct format for your new, 
hand-crafted field.

Six Kinds of Queries
Delete query
 
Be careful about running delete queries. A delete query deletes records and 
doesn’t give you the opportunity to get the records back if you change your 
mind about deleting them. If used skillfully, however, a delete query is a 
great way to purge records from more than one database table at once. Back 
up your database file before running a delete query. Edith Piaf didn’t regret 
her delete query, but you might regret yours.
 
 To run a delete query, start a new query, and on the (Query Tools) Design 
tab, click the Delete button. Then make as though you were running a select 
query but target the records you want to delete. Finally, click the Run button 
to run the query.
You can delete records from more than one table as long as the tables are 
related and you chose the Cascade Delete Related Records option in the Edit 
Relationships dialog box when you linked the tables. (See Chapter 2 of this 
mini-book for advice about forging relationships between tables.)
 
To preview the records that will be deleted before you run the delete query, 
switch to Datasheet view (click the View button). Those records you see? 
The delete query will delete them if you click the Run button.
Update query
An update query is a way to reach into a database and update records in sev-
eral different tables all at one time. Update queries can be invaluable, but as 
with delete queries, they can have untoward consequences. Back up your 
database before you run an update query; then follow these steps to run it:
 
 1. Starting in Design view, go to the (Query Tools) Design tab and click 
the Update button.
 
2. In the field with the data that needs updating, enter text or a value in 
the Update To line. You can even enter another field name in square 
brackets ( [] ).
 
 What you enter in the Update To line replaces what’s in the field of the 
records you collect.
 
 3. Click the Run button.
To update records in more than one table, you must have chosen the 
Cascade Update Related Fields option in the Edit Relationships dialog box 
when you linked the tables. (See the section in Chapter 2 of this mini-book 
about forging relationships between tables.)

Chapter 5: Presenting Data 
in a Report
In This Chapter
✓ Creating a new report
✓ Opening a report
✓ Changing the look of a report
T
he prettiest way to present data in a database table or query is to 
present it in a report. Even people who are allergic to databases can 
put up with database material in a report. Reports are easy to read and 
understand. They succinctly present the data so that you and others can 
interpret it. This brief chapter explains how to create reports, open them, 
and edit them.
Creating a Report
Access comes with all kinds of complicated tools for fashioning your own 
report — for laying out the pages in different ways and making data fields 
show up in different parts of the page. If ever a task called for relying on a 
wizard, creating a report is it. You can save yourself a lot of trouble, and 
fashion sophisticated-looking reports as well, by dispensing with the fancy 
report-making tools and letting the wizard do the job.
 
What’s more, the easiest and best way to make a report is to base your 
report on a query. As part of fashioning a report with a wizard, you can tell 
Access which database tables and which fields to get the data from — in 
other words, you can query your database from inside the Report Wizard. 
However, doing that requires turning somersaults and cartwheels. It’s far 
easier to run a query to produce the results you want in your report, save 
your query, and then fashion a report from the query results. Chapter 4 in 
this mini-book explains how to create a query.

594
Creating a Report
 
 To create a report with the Report Wizard, go to the Create tab and click the 
Report Wizard button. You see the first of several Report Wizard dialog 
boxes. Negotiate the dialog boxes as follows, clicking the Next button as you 
go along:
 
✦ Tables/Queries: Open this drop-down list and choose the query where 
the information in the report will come from. A list of fields in the query 
appears in the Available Fields box.
 
✦ Available Fields and Selected Fields: Select the fields whose data you 
want in the report by selecting the fields one at a time and clicking the > 
button. Doing so moves field names from the Available Fields box to the 
Selected Fields box. Add all the fields by clicking the >> button.
 
✦ How Do You Want to View Your Data?: Choose a field to define the 
grouping level. A grouping level is like a report subheading. For example, 
if you make Last Name the grouping level, information in the report is 
presented under people’s last names.
 
✦ Do You Want to Add Any Grouping Levels?: Include subheadings in 
your report by selecting a field name and clicking the > button to make 
it a subheading. If you’re building your report on a query that includes 
related tables, the Report Wizard automatically adds subheadings.
 
✦ What Sort Order and Summary Information Do You Want?: Select up 
to four fields to sort the data in your report. Even if you sort the fields in 
a query, the report handles sorting on its own. If you include grouping 
levels, the report already sorts on these fields.
 
✦ How Would You Like to Lay Out Your Report?: Experiment with the 
options, and watch the Preview box, to choose a layout for your report. 
If your report has a lot of fields, you may want to print it in Landscape 
view.
 
✦ What Title Do You Want for Your Report?: Enter a descriptive title. The 
name you choose appears in the Reports group in the Navigation pane. 
From there, you double-click the name when you want to see the report.
 
✦ Preview the Report: Select this option button and click Finish.
The report appears in the Preview window, as shown in Figure 5-1. How do 
you like it? Later in this chapter, “Tweaking a Report” offers some tips for 
making a report look spiffier.

Opening and Viewing Reports
If you’ve spent any time whatsoever in Access, you know the drill for open-
ing a so-called object. Follow these steps to open a report:
 
1. In the Navigation pane, select the Reports group.
 
 You see the names of reports you created.
 
2. Double-click a report name or right-click a name and choose Open 
from the shortcut menu.
 
 The report appears in Report view.
 
To update a report so that it includes recently added data, go to the Home 
tab and click the Refresh All button.
Tweaking a Report
As I mention at the start of this chapter, Access offers a bunch of complex 
tools for changing the layout and appearance of a report. If you’re coura-
geous and have lots of time on your hands, you’re invited to take these tools 
in hand and go to it. In the Reports group of the Navigation pane, right-click 
a report and choose Layout View on the shortcut menu. Your report appears 
in Layout view, as shown in Figure 5-2. In this view, using tools on the Report 
Layout Tools tabs, you can tweak your report’s appearance.

I tell you how to create a report with the Report Wizard in order to avoid 
your having to visit this imposing window. However, you can change a 
report’s appearance in Layout view without going to very much trouble if 
you follow these instructions:
 
✦ Choosing a new layout: On the (Report Design Tools) Arrange tab, click 
the Stacked or Tubular button, or click the Gridlines button and choose 
an option on the drop-down list, to change your report’s layout.
 
 
✦ Including page numbers: To include page numbers on the report, go 
the (Report Design Tools) Design tab and click the Page Numbers 
button. You see the Page Numbers dialog box shown in Figure 5-3. 
Choose the Page N option button to display a page number only, or 
select the Page N of M option button to display a page number as well as 
the total number of pages in the report (as in “Page 2 of 4”). Choose 
Alignment and Position options to describe where on the page to put the 
page number.
 
✦ Changing the margins: On the (Report Design Tools) Page Setup tab, 
click the Margins button and select Normal, Wide, or Narrow on the 
drop-down list.

An easier way to tweak a report is to transfer 
your report to Microsoft Word and edit it there. 
Follow these steps to turn an Access report 
into a Word document:
 1. On the External Data tab, click the More 
button and choose Word on the drop-down 
list.
 
 You see the Export - RTF File dialog box.
 2. Click the Browse button, and in the File 
Save dialog box, choose a folder for stor-
ing the Word document, and click the 
Save button.
 3. In the Export - RTF File dialog box, choose 
Open the Destination File After the Export 
Operation Is Complete.
 4. Click the OK button.
In a moment, your Access report appears in 
Word. The file is an RTF (rich text format) file. To 
save it as a Word file, go to the File tab, choose 
Save As, and in the Save As dialog box, open 
the Save As Type drop-down list and choose 
Word Document. Books I and II describe how 
to work with files in Word.

W
elcome to Publisher 2010. Not long ago, creating professional publi-
cations like the kind you can create with Publisher required sophis-
ticated printing equipment and a background in graphic design. However, 
even a novice can now create professional-looking publications with 
Publisher. As long as you rely on a publication design — a template that 
comes with Publisher — most of the layout work is done for you. All you 
have to do is enter the text and the other particulars.
“A Print Shop in a Can”
Publisher has been called “a print shop in a can” because the program is great 
for creating prefabricated brochures, business cards, calendars, newsletters, 
résumés, posters, and the like. To make these publications without going to 
a great deal of trouble, however, you have to stick to the template. Each tem-
plate provides you with a ready-made brochure, calendar, and so on.
Chances are you can find a suitable template for whatever kind of publi-
cation you want to create. Figure 1-1 shows examples of advertising tem-
plates. Templates include placeholders for graphics and text. To create a 
publication, you choose a template, choose a design, enter graphics and 
text in the publication where the placeholders are, and tweak the publica-
tion to your liking.

602
Introducing Frames

Choose a template
Customize the design
Striking out on your own and designing publications like those in Figure 1-1 
can be done, but you need a thorough knowledge of Publisher and a full 
head of hair. You need the hair because much of it will have been pulled out 
in frustration by the time you finish your design. I venture to say that the 
people who invented Publisher expect everyone to work from ready-made 
templates. Designing publications from scratch is simply too difficult. Don’t 
be discouraged, however, because you can almost always find a publication 
design for whatever you want to communicate.
Introducing Frames
The publications that you make with Publisher are composed of frames. A 
frame is a placeholder for text, a graphic, or a table. Complex publications 
have dozens of frames; simple publications have only a few. Frames keep 
text and graphics from overlapping. They make sure that everything stays 
on the page where it should be. As you create a publication, you enter text 
or graphics in frames.
The publication in Figure 1-2 is made up of several frames that were stitched 
together to form a poster. On the left side of the figure, I selected the frames, 
and you can see the frame boundaries; the right side of the figure shows

603
Creating a Publication
what the poster looks like after it is printed. Frames make laying out publi-
cations easier. When you want to move text, a picture, a table, or an image, 
you simply drag its frame to a new location. After you select a frame, the 
commands you give apply to the text or graphic in the frame. Frames do not 
appear in the finished product — they are meant strictly to help with the 
laying out of text and graphics.

Creating a Publication
 
 To create a new publication, go to the File tab and choose New (or press 
Ctrl+N). You see the Available Templates window (refer to Figure 1-1). Starting 
here, you create a publication by selecting a template name and then clicking 
the Create button (if the template is stored on your computer) or the 
Download button (if you need to download the template from Office.com). As 
you search for a template, remember that you can click the Back, Forward, or 
Home button to retrace your search in the Available Templates window.
Use one of these techniques in the Available Templates window to create a 
publication:
 
✦ Start from a template category: Select the icon representing a category 
(Brochures, Business Cards, and so on). You see a dozen or more tem-
plates. Scroll through the list and select a template.
 
✦ Search for a template: In the Search for Templates text box, enter the 
name of a publication type and click the Search button (or press Enter). 
Then select a template.
 
✦ Use a template you created: Click the My Templates icon and then 
select your template.

604
Redesigning a Publication
 
After you select a template in the Available Templates window, you can 
choose a color scheme, font scheme for your publication, and other 
options on the right side of the Available Templates window. But I suggest 
waiting until you’ve created your publication before choosing colors and 
fonts. You can study your publication more closely after you create it. You 
can look through it and decide what you want it to look like. What’s more, 
choosing new colors and fonts for a publication is as easy as pie, as I 
explain very shortly.
Redesigning a Publication
 
Make your design choices carefully. In theory, you can change publication 
designs, color schemes, and design options when you are well along in a 
project, but in practice, changing these designs can have unforeseen conse-
quences. If you change the color of a headline, for example, and then choose 
a new color scheme, the headline might be swallowed or rendered invisible 
by a background color in the new scheme. If you enter a bunch of text, 
change the size of a few frames, and then choose a new template for your 
publication, you may turn your publication into corned-beef hash and have 
to start over.
To redesign a publication, go to the Page Design tab. As shown in Figure 1-3, 
this tab offers opportunities for changing templates, the orientation and size 
of pages, color schemes, and font schemes. If your publication has more than 
one page, click page thumbnails in the Page Navigation pane to visit different 
pages and see what they look like. (If you don’t see the Page Navigation pane, 
go to the View tab and select the Page Navigation check box.)
Choosing a different template
 
 Not happy with the template you chose when you created your publication? 
To exchange it for a new one, go to the Page Design tab and click the Change 
Template button. You return to the Available Templates window, where you 
can select a different template (refer to Figure 1-1).
Choosing a font scheme
You will be glad to know that most of the text formats that are available 
in Word are also available in Publisher on the Home tab. To boldface text, 
select it and click the Bold button. To change font sizes, choose an option on 
the Font Size drop-down list.

To avoid going to the trouble of formatting text, you can choose a font scheme, 
a pair of fonts for the headings and body text in a publication. Font schemes 
spare you the trouble of having to format the text on your own. The schemes 
were designed by people who know what they’re doing. They look good.
 
 To choose a font scheme, go to the Page Design tab, click the Fonts button, 
and select a scheme on the drop-down list. If you really know what you’re 
doing, you can choose Create New Font Scheme on the drop-down list and 
select fonts for heading text and body text in the dialog box that appears.
Choosing a color scheme
To choose a different color scheme for your publication, go to the Page Design 
tab and select a scheme in the Schemes gallery (refer to Figure 1-3). If you’re 
daring, choose Create New Color Scheme at the bottom of the gallery and 
fashion your own color scheme in the Create New Color Scheme dialog box.

606
Redesigning a Publication
Brochures, newsletters, letterheads, enve-
lopes, and a handful of other publication types 
include what Publisher calls “business infor-
mation.” Publisher plugs this information — an 
individual name, title, company name, address, 
phone number, motto, and even a logo — into 
the publication. The information comes from 
the Business Information dialog box. As long 
as the information in this dialog box is up-to-
date, you needn’t be concerned whether the 
information appears in the right places in a 
publication or whether it’s accurate. And you 
don’t have to enter the information directly into 
the publication you’re working on.
To enter business information, go to the Insert 
tab, click the Business Information button, and 
choose Edit Business Information on the drop-
down list. You see the Create New Business 
Information dialog box (if you entered business 
information previously, click the Edit button 
in the Business Information dialog box). Enter 
information in the dialog box, choose a name 
for the information, and click the Save button. 
The information you enter will be plugged into 
all publications you create in the future, as well 
as the publication you’re working on (if you 
click the Update Publication button).
If you need to edit the business information 
you entered or create secondary information 
about another business, click the Business 
Information button, choose Edit Business 
Information, and in the Business Information 
dialog box, click the Edit button. You see the 
Edit Business Information Set dialog box, 
where you can enter information about another 
business and save it under a different name.
Notice the Select a Business Information Set 
drop-down list in the Business Information 
dialog box. Open this drop-down list to select 
which business information set you need for 
the publication you’re working on.
Publisher offers an unwieldy command for 
quickly entering business information one 
tidbit at a time: Select the frame where you 
want information to appear, click the Business 
Information button, and choose an informa-
tion tidbit on the drop-down list. Then adjust 
the frame in which the information appears 
(Chapter 2 of this mini-book explains how).

Getting a Better View of Your Work
Setting up your pages
On the Page Design tab, visit the Page Setup group to determine the margin 
size, orientation, and page size of your publication:
 
 
✦ Margins: Click the Margins button and choose an option on the drop-
down list or click Custom Margins to enter margin measurements in the 
Layout Guides dialog box.
 
 
✦ Orientation: Click the Orientation button and choose Portrait or 
Landscape on the drop-down list to stand your publication upright or 
turn it on its side.
 
 
✦ Size: Click the Size button and select a page size on the drop-down list. 
You can choose Create New Page Size on the menu to declare a page 
size of your own for your publication in the Create New Page Size dialog 
box. Decide right away which page size to use for your publication. How 
large or small the page is determines how the headings, graphics, and 
text fit on the pages.
Getting a Better View of Your Work
Because seeing the little details as well as the big picture matters so much in 
a publication, Publisher offers many tools for changing views of your work. 
Figure 1-4 shows what these tools are. They are described in the following 
pages.
Zooming in and out
Apart from the standard Zoom controls found in most Office programs 
(Book I, Chapter 3 describes the Zoom controls in the lower-right corner of 
the screen), Publisher offers a handful of other commands for zooming in or 
out. Go to the View tab and take advantage of these techniques as you refine 
your publication:
 
 
✦ Make the page fit squarely in the window: Click the Whole Page button 
(or press Ctrl+Shift+L) to make the entire page fit in the window. The 
lower-right corner of the window also offers a Whole Page button; you 
can click it when you’re not working in the View tab.
 
 
✦ Make the width of the page fit in the window: Click the Page Width 
button.
 
 
✦ Focus on objects: Select an object (a text frame or graphic, for example) 
or a handful of objects and click the Selected Objects button to zoom in 
on what you selected. Being able to focus this way is very helpful when 
you’re working on a publication that is crowded with words and images.
 
 
✦ View your publication at its actual size: Click the 100% button.

Viewing single pages and two-page spreads
On the View tab, click the Two-Page Spread button to see facing pages in 
newsletters, brochures, and other publications with more than one page 
(refer to Figure 1-4). Choose this command early and often. It permits you to 
see what readers of your publication will see when they view facing pages. 
Click the Single Page button to see a single page in the window.
Going from page to page
Use these techniques to get from page to page in a publication:
 
✦ Page Navigation pane: In a publication with more than one page, go 
from page to page by clicking thumbnail pages in the Page Navigation 
pane (refer to Figure 1-4). To display this pane, visit the View tab and 
click the Page Navigation check box.
 
 
✦ The Go To Page dialog box: On the Home tab, click the Find button (or 
press Ctrl+G) and enter a page number in the Go To Page dialog box.

Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
 
To help you identify pages, you can name them. When you move the pointer 
over a page thumbnail in the Page Navigation pane, the name appears in a 
pop-up box. To name a page, right-click its thumbnail in the Page Navigation 
pane and choose Rename on the shortcut menu. In the Rename Page dialog 
box, enter a descriptive name.
Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
Making frames, graphics, and lines of text line up squarely on the page is 
essential if your publication is to look smart and snappy. Readers tend to go 
cockeyed when they see side-by-side columns with the text in one column 
slightly askew of the text in the column beside it. A graphic or text frame 
that spills into the margin is a breach of etiquette punishable by death. A 
row of graphics has to be just that — a row, not a crooked line. To keep 
pages neat and tidy, Publisher offers several types of layout guides, as the 
following pages explain.
Making use of layout guides
As shown in Figure 1-5, Publisher offers margin guides, grid guides, ruler 
guides, and baselines to help you lay out frames, graphics, and other objects 
on the pages of your publications. Use these layout guides early and often.
 
To see margin guides, grid guides, and ruler guides on your publication, you 
must go to the View tab and select the Guides check box.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Layout 
guides (left 
to right): 
margin 
guides, grid 
guides, ruler 
guides, and 
baselines.
 
Margin guides
Margin guides are blue lines that clearly show where page margins begin and 
end (refer to Figure 1-5). Use the margin guides to make sure that objects 
don’t stray too far into the margin.

610
Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
Margin guides appear on the page as long as the Guides check box on the 
View tab is selected. Where the margin guides appear depends on the 
Margin setting you chose for your publication. (On the Page Design tab, click 
the Margins button and choose a setting.)
Grid guides
Grid guides are blue lines that appear in grid form across the page (refer 
to Figure 1-5). Frames and objects can be made to “snap to the grid” (see 
“Snapping objects to ruler and grid lines,” later in this chapter). Because the 
objects snap, you’re spared the trouble of aligning them because they line 
up on grid guides.
 
 To determine where gridlines are and display them on pages, go to the Page 
Design tab, click the Guides button, and choose Grid and Baseline Guides on 
the drop-down list. You see the Grid Guides tab of the Layout Guides dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 1-6. Do the following and click OK.
 
✦ Enter numbers to determine how many rows and columns form the gird.
 
✦ Enter Spacing measurements to determine how close objects can come 
to grid guides. Think carefully about entering a number less than .2 in 
the Spacing boxes. If you enter 0, for example, objects and frames will 
touch each other when they snap to the grid.
 
✦ Select the Add Center Guide between Columns and Rows check box if 
you want to draw a line between the lines formed by columns and rows 
in the grid.
To remove grid guides, return to the Grid Guides tab of the Layout Guides 
dialog box and enter 1 in the Columns text box and 1 in the Rows text box. 
You can also go to the View tab and deselect the Guides check box to tempo-
rarily remove grid guides.

Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
Ruler guides
Ruler guides are green horizontal and vertical lines that you can place on the 
page for assistance in aligning frames and objects (refer to Figure 1-5). You 
can draw ruler guides where you need them and remove the guides very 
easily when they get in the way. Whereas grid guides appear on every page 
in a publication, ruler guides appear on one page. You can, however, place 
the same ruler guides on every page by drawing the ruler guides on the 
master page (Chapter 3 of this mini-book describes master pages).
Go to the Page Design tab and use one of these techniques to place ruler 
guides on a page:
 
 
✦ Built-in ruler guides: Click the Guides button and choose a built-in ruler 
guide option on the drop-down list to place many ruler guides on a page.
 
✦ Drawn ruler guides: Click the Guides button and choose Add Horizontal 
Ruler Guide or Add Vertical Ruler Guide. A ruler guide appears horizon-
tally or vertically across the center of the page. Click and drag the ruler 
guide across the page to a new location.
 
✦ Ruler Guides dialog box: Click the Guides button and choose Ruler 
Guides. You see the Ruler Guides dialog box. Enter horizontal or vertical 
measurements for the guides and click OK.
 
You can also place a ruler guide on a page by copying a ruler guide that is 
already there. Hold down the Ctrl key and drag an existing ruler guide to 
create a new guide.
To remove ruler guides from a page, go to the Page Design tab, click the 
Guides button, and choose No Ruler Guides on the drop-down list. You can 
temporarily remove ruler guides by deselecting the Guides check box on the 
View tab.
Baselines
Baselines are brown, dotted, horizontal lines that appear on the page to help 
with aligning frames, objects, and lines of text (refer to Figure 1-5). To make 
baselines appear, go to the View tab and select the Baselines check box.
To decide the frequency of baselines, go to the Page Design tab, click the 
Guides button, and choose Grid and Baseline Guides on the drop-down list. 
The Layout Guides dialog box appears. On the Baseline Guides tab, enter 
Spacing measurements to determine how tight or loose the lines are, and 
Offset measurements to determine how far off the margin settings the lines 
are. Figure 1-6 shows the Baseline Guides tab of the Layout Guides dialog box.

612
Understanding and Using the Layout Guides
Snapping objects to ruler and grid lines
On the Page Design tab, the commands in the Layout group make frames and 
objects snap to ruler guides or grid guides. Snapping helps to make objects 
line up squarely. On the Page Design tab, select the Guides check box (or 
press Ctrl+Shift+W) to make objects snap to the guides; select the Objects 
check box to make objects snap to other objects on the page.
Rulers, when they aren’t coming in very handy, 
get in the way. To display or hide rulers, go to 
the View tab and select or deselect the Rulers 
check box.
For precision work, you can drag a ruler into 
the middle of the window and use it as an aid 
for lining up frames and other objects. Hold 
down the Shift key, click on a ruler, and drag it 
into the middle of the window. To move it back 
where it came from, Shift+drag all over again.

T
his chapter picks up where the previous chapter left off. In Chapter 1 of 
this mini-book, you discover how to create a publication, find your way 
around the screen, and use the different guides. In this chapter, you explore 
how to make a publication your own. This chapter offers speed techniques 
for entering and editing text. It explains how to handle frames, make text 
“flow” from frame to frame, and put graphics and other kinds of art in a pub-
lication. Bon voyage!
Entering Text on the Pages
The placeholder text that appears in publication designs has to go, of 
course. One of your first tasks is to replace the placeholder text with your 
own words. In the case of a story, you have a lot of writing and replacing to 
do (story is Publisher’s term for an article that reaches across several text 
frames). If you’re putting together a sign or greeting card, you have only a 
handful of words to write.
If you have to replace more than two dozen words, follow these steps to 
replace the placeholder text in a text frame with text of your own:
 
1. Read the first paragraph of the placeholder text to see how many 
words can fit in the text frames that hold the story.
 
 Each placeholder story starts with a sentence describing roughly how 
many words are in the story. You can spare yourself a lot of time and 
trouble by making the replacement text roughly as many words as the 
placeholder text.

614
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
 
2. In Word, write the text and save the text in a file.
 
 You can call on all the Word commands to edit the text. You can also 
copy text from elsewhere into the Word document. Later you will copy 
this file into Publisher. The status bar in Word tells you how many 
words are in a file. See if you can keep to the number of words that are 
in the placeholder text.
 
 3. In Publisher, click in the placeholder text, go to the Home tab, click 
the Styles button, and note on the Styles drop-down list which style 
has been assigned to the placeholder text.
 
 You can tell which style has been assigned to the text because it is 
selected on the Styles drop-down list. In Step 6, you will assign the style 
that is currently applied to the text to the replacement text you insert 
into the text frame.
 
4. If necessary, press Ctrl+A to select the text in the story, and with the 
text selected, right-click and choose Change Text➪Text File.
 
 You see the Insert Text dialog box. You can also open this dialog box by 
going to the Insert tab and clicking the Insert File button.
 
5. Select the Word file with the replacement text and click the OK 
button.
 
 Replacement text from the Word file “flows” into the text frame or 
frames. If the replacement text doesn’t fit in the text frames allotted to 
the story, you see the Autoflow dialog box. You can click the Yes button 
to tell Publisher to flow the text into different text frames in the publica-
tion, but I recommend clicking No in the Autoflow dialog box. Later in 
this chapter, “Making text flow from frame to frame” explains how to 
decide on your own where to put overflow text from a story.
 
 The replacement text maintains the styles assigned to it in the Word 
document. In the next step, you reassign a style to the text.
 
 6. Press Ctrl+A to select the text in the story, go to the Home tab, click 
the Styles button, and choose the style that was assigned to the place-
holder text.
 
 In Step 2, you noted which style this was. Later in this chapter, 
“Formatting Text” explains how to format text with styles.
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
When text doesn’t fit in a text frame, red selection handles appear around 
the frame, and if the text frame holds a story, the Text In Overflow icon 
appears in the lower-right corner of the text frame, as shown in Figure 2-1. 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Refining a 
Publication
615
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
When you see this icon and the red selection handles, it means that you 
must make decisions about how to fit stray text into text frames. You can 
either fit the text into an existing frame, or, if you’re dealing with a story, 
flow the text to other frames. These pages explain strategies for handling 
text that doesn’t fit in text frames.

Fitting overflow text in a single frame
To fit a heading or paragraph into a single text frame, try one of these 
techniques:
 
 
✦ Shrink the text automatically: On the (Text Box Tools) Format tab, click 
the Text Fit button and choose Shrink Text On Overflow on the drop-
down list. This command shrinks the point size of text so that all text fits 
in the frame. Sometimes, however, shrinking the text this way makes the 
heading or paragraph hard to read.
 
✦ Edit the text: Snip out a word or sentence here and there to make the 
text fit. Have you ever wondered why magazine articles always fill the 
page and never end in the middle? That’s because skillful editors and 
typesetters remove and add words here and there to make the story fit 
the page.

616
Making Text Fit in Text Frames
 
✦ Make the text frame larger: See “Changing the size and position of 
frames,” later in this chapter.
 
 
✦ Make the text frame margins smaller: Like a page, text frames have 
internal margins to keep text from getting too close to the frame border. 
To shrink these margins and make more room for text, go to the (Text 
Box Tools) Format tab, click the Margins button, and choose Narrow on 
the drop-down list. You can also choose Custom Margins, and on the 
Text Box tab of the Format Text Box dialog box, enter smaller measure-
ments for the text box margins.
Making text flow from frame to frame
As shown in Figure 2-1, the Text In Overflow icon and red selection handles 
appear when story text overflows a text frame. How do you flow story text 
from frame to frame and handle a story that is spread across several frames? 
Better keep reading.
Flowing text to another frame
If necessary, create a new text box for the overflow text and follow these 
steps to direct text from one frame to another in your publication:
 
1. Select the text frame with overflowing text.
 
 
 You can tell when text is overflowing because the Text in Overflow icon 
appears in the lower-right corner of the frame (refer to Figure 2-1).
 
 2. On the (Text Box) Formatting tab, click the Create Link button.
 
 The pointer turns into an overflowing pitcher (or is that a beer stein?) 
after you click the button.
 
3. Move the pointer over the box that you want the text to flow into.
 
 You may have to click a page navigation button to go to another page. 
See “Inserting Frames on the Pages,” later in this chapter, if you need 
help creating a new text frame.
 
4. Click in the target text box to make the text flow there.
A continuation slug is a notice that tells the 
reader where to turn to continue reading an 
article or where an article is continued from. 
Publisher offers a nifty command for entering 
continuation slugs at the bottom or top of text 
frames:
 1. Right-click the text frame that needs a 
slug and choose Format Text Box.
 2. On the Text Box tab of the Format Text Box 
dialog box, select the Include “Continued 
on Page” or Include “Continued from 
Page” check box and click OK.

Handling text frames in a story
As I mention earlier, text frames that are linked are known as a story in 
Publisher-speak. Here are techniques for handling text frames that are linked 
in a story:
 
 
✦ Going from text frame to text frame: On the (Text Box) Formatting 
tab, click the Next or Previous button to go from frame to frame. You 
can also select a text frame and click its Go to Next Text Box or Go to 
Previous Text Box icon (refer to Figure 2-1).
 
✦ Selecting the text in all the text frames: Press Ctrl+A; or go to the Home 
tab, click the Select button, and choose Select All Text in Text Box on 
the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Breaking the link between frames: Select the frame that you want to be 
the last one in the chain, and on the (Text Box Tools) Format tab, click 
the Break button.
 
In a crowded publication, it’s easy to overlook a text frame with overflow-
ing text. To find these text frames, go to the File tab, and on the Information 
page, click the Run Design Checker button. Then, in the Design Checker task 
pane, look for “Story with Text in Overflow Area.”
Filling out a text frame
The opposite of an overflow problem is a text frame with too much blank 
space. Here are some techniques for handling semi-vacant text frames:
 
 
✦ Use the Best Fit option: On the (Text Box Tools) Format tab, click the 
Text Fit button and choose Best Fit on the drop-down list. This com-
mand enlarges the text so that it fills the frame. Sometimes, however, 
the command makes text too big.
 
✦ Edit the text: Add a word or sentence here or there. In the case of head-
ings, write a subheading as well.
 
✦ Insert a graphic, page part, or advertisement: Placing a small graphic, 
page part, or advertisement on the page makes the page livelier and 
fills the dead space. Chapter 3 of this mini-book explains techniques for 
decorating dead space on pages.
Formatting Text
Use these techniques to format the text in a publication:
 
✦ Home tab font and paragraph commands: The commands on the Home 
tab for changing the look of text and paragraphs are nearly identical to 
the Home tab commands in Word and PowerPoint. Book I, Chapter 2 
explains these commands.

618
Making Text Wrap around a Frame or Graphic
 
 
✦ Styles: Select text, and on the Home tab, click the Styles button and 
choose a style on the drop-down list to format text. Each template 
comes with many different styles. Beware, however, because you can get 
lost on the Style drop-down list. Be prepared to click the Undo button 
often as you experiment with styles.
Making Text Wrap around a Frame or Graphic
Wrap text around a frame, clip-art image, picture, or WordArt image and 
you get a very elegant layout. Figure 2-2 shows text that has been wrapped 
around a clip-art image. Looks nice, doesn’t it? Wrapping text may be the 
easiest way to impress innocent bystanders with your layout prowess. As 
Figure 2-2 shows, text wrapped tightly follows the contours of the picture, 
whereas text wrapped squarely runs flush with the picture’s frame.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Text 
wrapped 
tightly 
(left) and 
squarely 
(right).
 
 
Here are shorthand instructions for wrapping text:
 
1. Select the item that text is to wrap around.
 
 In Figure 2-2, you would select the clip-art image.
 
 2. On the Format tab, click the Wrap Text button and choose a wrapping 
option on the drop-down list.
 
 For Figure 2-2, I chose Tight for the picture on the left and Square for the 
picture on the right.
The Wrap Text commands are identical in Word and Publisher. Book II, 
Chapter 4 (about wrapping objects in Word) explains the wrapping com-
mands in detail.

Inserting Frames on the Pages
Replacing the Placeholder Pictures
As you must have noticed by now, publication designs are littered with 
generic clip-art images and graphics. Besides writing your own words where 
the placeholder ones are, replace the generic pictures with pictures of your 
own. Well, do it if you please. You are welcome to pass off the generic pic-
tures as your own. I won’t tell anybody.
Follow these steps to put a picture of your own where a placeholder picture 
is now:
 
1. Click the placeholder picture to select it.
 
 You can also select a picture by clicking its name in the Graphics 
Manager. To use the Graphics Manger, go to the View tab and click the 
Graphics Manager check box. The Graphics Manger opens on the right 
side of the screen.
 
 2. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Change Picture button 
and choose Change Picture on the drop-down list.
 
 The Insert Picture dialog box appears. In the Graphics Manager, open 
the drop-down list on a picture name and choose Replace This Picture 
to open the Insert Picture dialog box.
 
3. Select a picture and click the Insert button.
 
 Your replacement picture may require cropping or recoloring. Book VIII, 
Chapter 3 describes how to handle graphics in all the Office programs. 
You’ll be delighted to discover that graphics are handled the same way, 
no matter which program you’re toiling in.
 
You can postpone choosing a picture to replace a placeholder picture. Right-
click the picture in question and choose Change Picture➪Remove Picture 
on the drop-down list. Publisher places a picture icon in the frame to remind 
you to insert a picture later on. You can click this picture icon to open the 
Insert Picture dialog box.
The next topic in this chapter is how to put a graphic on the page without 
the benefit of a placeholder graphic.
Inserting Frames on the Pages
Publications are made of frames — text box frames, table frames, picture 
frames, or clip-art frames. Nothing appears on the pages of a publication 
unless it appears within the confines of a frame. These pages explain every-
thing you need to know about frames. You can find out how to insert a new 

620
Inserting Frames on the Pages
frame, adjust the size of a frame, align frames, and place borders around 
frames. You can also see how to make frames and the words or images 
inside them overlap.
Inserting a new frame
How you insert a new frame depends on what you want to insert: a text box, 
table, picture, clip-art image, or WordArt image. Start by clicking on the page 
roughly where you want the frame to go. Then insert the new frame by using 
the techniques described here. (See “Making Text Wrap around a Frame or 
Graphic,” earlier in this chapter, for information about wrapping text around 
a frame. See “Changing the size and position of frames,” later in this chapter, 
to find out how to change a frame’s shape.)
To delete a frame, all you have to do is select it and press the Delete key or 
right-click and choose Delete Object. You can tell when a frame is selected 
because selection handles appear on the corners and sides.
Inserting a text box frame
 
 To insert a text-box frame, go to the Insert or Home tab and click the Draw 
Text Box button. Then click on the page and drag to create the text box. 
Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to change the background color and border 
of a text box.
Inserting a table
 
 To insert a table, go to the Insert or Home tab and use one of these 
techniques:
 
✦ Click the Table button and move the pointer in the drop-down list to the 
number of columns and rows you want, click, and let go of the mouse 
button.
 
✦ Click the Table button and choose Insert Table on the drop-down list. 
The Create Table dialog box appears. Enter the number of rows and col-
umns you want and click OK.
Book I, Chapter 5 explains everything a mortal needs to know about tables in 
Publisher.
Inserting a picture or clip-art image
Follow these steps to insert a picture, clip-art image, or WordArt image:
 
 1, On the Insert tab, click the Picture Placeholder button.
 
 A picture placeholder frame appears.

Book VII

Inserting Frames on the Pages
 
2. As best you can, make the frame the size you want your picture or 
image to be.
 
 The next section in this chapter, “Changing the size and position of 
frames,” describes how to do this.
 
3. Insert a picture or clip-art image.
 
 On the Insert tab, use one of these techniques to insert the item:
 
 
• Picture: Click the picture icon in the placeholder frame or the Picture 
button. You see the Insert Picture dialog box. Select a picture and 
click the Insert button.
 
 
• Clip-art image: Click the Clip Art button. The Clip Art task pane 
opens. Search for an image, select it, and open its drop-down list and 
choose Insert. Book VIII, Chapter 4 explains all the details of inserting 
clip-art images.
 
 4. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, Click the Fill button to make a pic-
ture that is too large for the frame fit inside the frame, or Click the Fill 
button to make a picture that is too small for the frame fill the frame.
 
 Book VIII, Chapter 3 explains all the doodads on the (Picture Tools) 
Format tab, in case you’re curious.
Changing the size and position of frames
After you click a frame and see the selection handles, you’re ready to change 
the size of the frame or adjust its position on the page. Use these standard 
techniques for resizing and moving frames:
 
✦ Changing the size of a frame: Move the pointer over a selection handle 
and start dragging. If you’re dealing with anything but a text frame, 
be careful about dragging a selection handle on the side of the frame. 
Dragging a side handle changes the frame’s size as well as its proportions. 
Images can blur or become distorted when you change their proportions.
 
✦ Changing the position of a frame: Move the pointer onto the frame 
(or the perimeter of a frame if you’re dealing with a text box), and click 
and drag when you see the four-headed arrow. To move more than one 
frame simultaneously, Ctrl+click the frames you want to move.
As I explain in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, frames snap to the grid as you 
move them, but you can hold down the Alt key as you drag to adjust frames 
with precision. You can also press an arrow key to move them ever so 
slightly.

622
Making Frames Overlap
Making Frames Overlap
When frames overlap, you have to tell Publisher which frame goes in front 
of the other. And you are hereby invited to overlap frames because overlap-
ping frames are artful and look good on the page. Figure 2-3 shows a portion 
of a newsletter. If you look closely, you can see where frames overlap in the 
figure. Overlapping frames like these make for a sophisticated layout.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Examples of 
overlapping 
frames.
 
Making frames overlap like the ones in Figure 2-3 requires a delicate balanc-
ing act, using these commands:
 
 
✦ Text wrapping: On the Format tab, click the Wrap Text button and 
choose None on the drop-down list.
 
 
✦ Fill Color: For frames and objects on the bottom of the stack to show 
through, the frames and objects above them cannot have a fill color that 
would obscure other objects. To remove the fill color, select the object, 
and on the Format tab, open the drop-down list on the Shape Fill button 
and choose No Fill.
 
✦ Object and frame order: To tell Publisher which object goes where 
in the stack, go to the Format tab and click the Bring Forward or Send 
Backward button as necessary. Book I, Chapter 8 explains all the tech-
niques for handling overlapping objects.
Inserting, Removing, and Moving Pages
Suppose that you have too many pages or you need to add a page or two. On 
the Page Navigation pane (select the Page Navigation check box on the View 
tab), click a thumbnail to select the page where you want to insert, remove, 
or move pages. Then follow these instructions:
 
 
✦ Inserting a new page: On the Insert tab, click the Page button and 
choose an option on the drop-down list:
 
• Insert Blank Page: Inserts an empty page.

• Insert Page: Opens the Insert Page dialog box, where you can enter 
the number of pages you want to insert and click an option button 
to put the new pages before or after the page you selected. You can 
also tell Publisher what to put on the new page or pages.
 
 
✦ Removing a page: On the Page Design tab, click the Delete button. You 
can also right-click a page thumbnail and choose Delete.
 
 
✦ Moving a page: On the Page Design tab, click the Move button. Give 
instructions for moving the page in the Move Page dialog box and

✓ Preparing publications so that they can be printed commercially
T
his final chapter in Book VII is devoted to the Project to Beautify 
Publications, a joint effort of the Dummies Press and the author to try to 
make publications less bland and more original. The author has noticed, on 
the bulletin boards and lampposts in his neighborhood, that the rummage 
sale and lost pet notices look a little rough around the edges. The neighbors 
are using sophisticated software to produce their notices, but they’re not 
using it well. They are relying solely on templates, which make the publica-
tions look alike. These pages explain a few simple tricks for making publica-
tions more sophisticated.
This chapter explores drop caps and horizontal rules, page backgrounds 
and borders, borders and backgrounds for frames, and how to place a logo 
in the same place on each page in a publication. It shows you Publisher’s 
excellent Design Checker. Finally, this chapter offers advice for printing pub-
lications at a commercial print shop.
Decorating the Text
Herewith are a couple of tricks to amaze your friends and intimidate your 
enemies. These pages explain how horizontal rules and drop caps can make 
a publication a little livelier. Don’t worry — horizontal rules have nothing 
to do with which side of the bed to sleep on, and drop caps don’t explode 
when you unroll them on the sidewalk and strike them with a hammer.

626
Decorating the Text
Drawing a horizontal rule on a frame
A horizontal rule is a horizontal line that divides one part of a page from 
another and directs the reader’s eye on the page. There are four horizontal 
rules in Figure 3-1. By varying the width of the lines — the width is known as 
the weight — and placing lines in strategic places, you can make a publica-
tion look more elegant and graceful.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Examples of 
horizontal 
rules.
 
 
Usually where horizontal rules come in pairs, the bottommost rule is thicker 
than its twin. The thicker bottom line encourages the reader’s eye to move 
down the page and find an article to read.
Select the frame and follow these steps to draw a horizontal rule on a frame:
 
1. On the Format tab, click the Text or Size group button.
 
 You can also select the frame, right-click it, and choose Format (the 
Format command has different names depending on what type of frame 
or object you’re working with). You see the Format dialog box.
 
2. Select the Color and Lines tab.
 
3. In the Preview box, click the top of the box to draw a rule above the 
frame or the bottom of the box to draw a rule below.
 
 By clicking part of the Preview box, you tell Publisher where you want to 
draw the rule.
 
4. On the Color menu, choose a line color for the horizontal rule.
 
5. On the Style menu, choose the kind of line you want.
 
 If you want a dashed line, select it from the Dashed drop-down list. You 
can adjust the thickness of the line in the Weight text box.
 
6. To draw a second rule on the frame, click again in the Preview box 
and repeat steps 4 and 5.

7. Click OK.
To remove a horizontal rule from a frame, select the frame, open the Format 
dialog box, open the Color drop-down list, and choose No Line.
Dropping in a drop cap
A drop cap is a large capital letter that “drops” into the text. Drop caps 
are usually found in the first paragraph of an article or chapter. Pound for 
pound, considering how little effort is required, a drop cap yields the most 
reward for the least amount of work. Follow these steps to place a drop cap 
in a publication:
 
1. Click the paragraph that is to receive the drop cap.
 
 2. On the (Text Box Tools) Format tab, click the Drop Cap button and 
choose a drop cap on the drop-down list or choose Custom Drop cap 
to open the Drop Cap dialog box.
 
 Figure 3-2 shows the Drop Cap dialog box. From here, you can choose 
how far to drop the capital letter or select a font and color for the letter.
 
 To remove a drop cap, click the Drop Cap button and choose No Drop 
Cap (the first option on the drop-down list).

Techniques for Decorating Pages
No one likes a dull publication. Following are some simple techniques to 
make pages a little bit livelier. Read on to find out how to put borders and 
color backgrounds on frames, and how to take advantage of page parts, bor-
ders, accents, and advertisements. You will also find instructions for paint-
ing an entire page with a background color or gray shade.

628
Techniques for Decorating Pages
Putting borders and color backgrounds on frames
As shown in Figure 3-3, putting borders and background colors on text 
frames makes the frames stand out. Everybody knows what a border is. A 
background color is a color or gray shade that fills a frame. Borders and 
background colors are ideal for calling readers’ attention to important 
notices and items in publications. To really get readers’ attention, for 
example, try using black for the background and white for the font color.

How to put borders and colors on frames and other objects is a topic in 
Book I, Chapter 8, but to spare you a trip to that part of the book, here are 
shorthand instructions for giving a background color or a border to a frame. 
Select the frame, go to the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, and follow these 
instructions:
 
✦ Shape Style: Choose a style on the Shape Styles gallery. You can 
“live-preview” these styles, and assigning a style from the gallery is the 
easiest way to decorate a frame.
 
 
✦ Background color: Open the drop-down list on the Shape Fill button 
and select a color. Choose No Fill to remove the background color or 
to create no background color so that frames below the frame you’re 
dealing with can show through.
 
 
✦ Color and size of the border: Open the drop-down list on the Shape 
Outline button and choose a color. On the shortcut menu, you can also 
choose Weight and a point size for the line that forms the border of the 
frame.
Instead of clicking buttons on the (Drawing Tools) Format tab, you can 
handle borders and backgrounds in the Format dialog box. Click the Shape 
Styles group button or right-click a frame and choose Format on the shortcut 
menu. In the Format dialog box, go to the Colors and Lines tab. It offers all 
kinds of commands for borders and backgrounds.

Techniques for Decorating Pages
Plugging in a page part
“Page part” is Publisher’s word for a page element that you can quickly plug 
into a page. Use a page part to fill in empty space on a page or get a head 
start in formatting part of a page. As shown in Figure 3-4, page parts include 
the following:
 
✦ Headings: A ready-made title for a page or story. Headings often include 
a subheading.
 
✦ Pull quotes: A preformatted text box frame for displaying a quotation 
from a story.
 
✦ Sidebars: A preformatted text-box frame for a companion story. 
Sidebars usually appear on a side of the page in a smaller font.
 
✦ Stories: A preformatted story, including a heading and a subheading.

Examples of 
page parts.

630
Techniques for Decorating Pages
Follow these steps to put a page part on a page:
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the Page Parts button.
 
2. Choose a heading, pull quote, sidebar, or story on the drop-down list.
 
 Choose More Page Parts to open the Building Block Library and choose 
from many more page parts.
After the element lands on the page, you can change its size or shift its 
position by using the same techniques you use with other objects. (Book 
I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate objects.) If the story or sidebar 
you inserted includes a picture, right-click the picture and choose Change 
Picture➪Change Picture to replace the picture with one of your own.
Experimenting with borders and accents
Publisher offers what it calls “borders and accents” to make pages a little 
livelier. Borders and accents are page decorations that also serve a purpose:
 
✦ Bars: Decorative patterns for filling empty page space
 
✦ Emphasis: Two-sided text-box frames to make text boxes stand out on 
the page
 
✦ Frames: Four-sided text-box frames to make text boxes stand out
 
✦ Lines: Unusual lines
 
✦ Patterns: Checkerboard and other patterns for filling empty page space
Follow these steps to place a border or accent on a publication page:
 
 1. On the Insert tab, click the Borders & Accents button.
 
2. Choose a border or accent on the drop-down list.
 
 Choose More Borders and Accents and make a selection in the Building 
Block Library if you want to place a line or pattern on a page.
The border or accent lands on the page. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to 
manipulate objects such as borders and accents.)
Taking advantage of attention getters
If your goal in Publisher is to create an advertisement, you can get a head 
start on the task by sprinkling an “attention getter” or advertisement in your 
publication. Figure 3-5 shows examples of attention getters.
 
 To use an attention getter or advertisement in your publication, go to the 
Insert tab, click the Advertisements button, and choose an ad or attention 
getter on the drop-down list. (Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to change the 
size and position of objects such as advertisements and attention getters.)

Backgrounds for pages
Yet another nifty trick is to put a color, gray-shade, or other type of back-
ground on the page. Be sure to choose a background that doesn’t get in the 
way of your publication or render it impossible to read. Shrink the publica-
tion to 40 percent so that you can see what backgrounds really look like; 
then follow these steps to give a page or all the pages in your publication a 
background:
 
 1. On the Page Design tab, click the Background button.
 
 A drop-down list opens, as shown in Figure 3-6.

or all pages.
 

632
Master Pages for Handling Page Backgrounds
 
2. Move the pointer over the options on the drop-down list to “live-
preview” the choices.
 
 You can choose More Backgrounds on the drop-down list to open the 
Fill Effects dialog box and choose or create a page background there. 
The dialog box gives you the opportunity to use a gradient, texture, pat-
tern, picture, or tint for a page background.
 
3. Apply your choice to a single page or all pages in your publication.
 
 You have the option of changing the page background on one page or all 
the pages:
 
• One page: On the Background button drop-down list, right-click your 
choice and choose Apply to Current Page.
 
• All pages: On the Background button drop-down list, right-click your 
choice and choose Apply to All Pages.
To remove the background from a page, click the Background button and 
choose No Background on the drop-down list.
 
To apply a page background from the Fill Effects dialog box to all the pages 
in a publication, switch to Master Page view, go to the Page Design tab, click 
the Background button, and create or choose a page background in the Fill 
Effects dialog box. Because it is on the master page, your page background 
choice applies to all pages. Master pages is the next topic in this chapter.
Master Pages for Handling Page Backgrounds
In a publication with many pages, the same object sometimes goes on every 
page. A company logo on the corner of each page looks mighty elegant. Page 
numbers and copyright information are also found on all the pages of some 
publications. The good news is that you don’t have to place the objects on 
each page individually. Instead, you can place the objects on the master 
page. Whatever is on the master page appears on all pages in a publication 
(unless you decide that the master page shouldn’t apply to a particular 
page). Forthwith are instructions for handling master pages.
Switching to Master Page view
To change the appearance of the master page, place an object on the master 
page, or see precisely what is on the master page, start by switching to 
Master Page view:
 
 
✦ On the View tab, click the Master Page button.
 
✦ On the Page Design tab, click the Master Pages button and choose Edit 
Master Pages on the drop-down list.

633
Master Pages for Handling Page Backgrounds
 
You can tell when you’re looking at a master page because you see the 
Master Page tab on the Ribbon and the page thumbnails in the Page 
Navigation pane show letters rather than numbers.
To leave Master Page view, go to the Master Page tab and click the Close 
Master Page button.
Changing the look of a master page
All commands for changing the look of run-of-the-mill pages also apply to 
master pages. Place objects and frames on the master page as if you were 
putting them on run-of-the-mill pages. Change the page background as if you 
were changing the background of a normal page.
To edit a master page, switch to Master Page, select the master page you 
want to work with in the Page Navigation tab (if you’ve created more than 
one master page), and get to work.
Creating another master page
Sometimes creating more than one master page is necessary. In a publica-
tion with facing pages, creating two master pages, one for the left-facing 
pages and another for the right-facing pages, is convenient. Follow these 
steps to create another master page:
 
1. In Master Page view, go to the View tab and select the Page Navigation 
check box (if it isn’t already selected).
 
 You need to be able to see your new master page in the Page Navigation 
tab.
 
 2. On the Master Page tab, click the Add Master Page button.
 
 The New Master Page dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Two-Page Master check box if you’re creating a master page 
for a publication with pages that will be folded.
 
4. If you want, enter a Page ID and description of your new master page.
 
 You can read page IDs and a description of master pages by moving the 
pointer over master page thumbnails in the Page Navigation pane.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Your new master page appears in the Page Navigation pane.
 
To turn a single master page into a two-page master (or vice versa), select 
the master page in the Page Navigation pane and click the Two Page Master 
button.

634
Running the Design Checker
Applying (or unapplying) a master 
page to publication pages
By default, the master page applies to all pages, but sometimes unapplying a 
master page is necessary because objects on the master page get in the way. 
And if you created more than one master page, you have to tell Publisher 
which master page to apply to which publication page.
Follow these instructions to unapply or apply master pages to pages in a 
publication:
 
 
✦ Unapplying a master page: In Normal view, go to the Page Design tab, 
display the page you want to unattach from the master page, click the 
Master Pages button, and choose None on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Applying a different master page: Use one of these techniques to apply 
a different master page to pages in your publication:
 
• In Normal view, display a page, go to the Page Design tab, click the 
Master Pages button, and choose a different master page on the 
drop-down list.
 
 
• In Master Page view, go to the Master Page tab, select a master page 
in the Navigation pane, and click the Apply To button. On the Apply 
To drop-down list, choose Apply to All Pages to apply a different 
master page to all the pages in your publication. Choose Apply 
Master Page on the drop-down list and enter page-range numbers in 
the Apply Master Page dialog box to apply the master page to a 
select group of pages.
Running the Design Checker
When at last your publication is ready for printing, be sure to run the Design 
Checker. This helpful tool can alert you to frames that fall on nonprinting 
parts of the page, stories that “overflow” without finding a text frame to go 
to, invisible objects, and a host of other problems.
 
 On the File tab, choose Info, and click the Run Design Checker button to run 
the Design Checker. As shown in Figure 3-7, the Design Checker task pane 
opens and lists items that need your attention. Open an item’s drop-down 
list and choose Go to This Item to locate it in your publication. Sometimes 
the drop-down list offers a quick fix as well.
 
To see which design flaws the Design Checker looks for, click the Design 
Checker Options hyperlink in the Design Checker task pane. Then, in the 
Design Checker Options dialog box, select the Checks tab and read the list.

Commercially Printing a Publication
You know the routine for printing a publication on your computer: Go to the 
File tab, choose Print, negotiate the Print window, and click the Print button. 
Sending a publication to a commercial printer is a different story. Publisher 
offers a number of commands for preparing a publication for printing in a 
print shop and packing up your publication before sending it to a printer.
Changing the commercial print settings
Commercial printers either print with process colors (also known as CMYK) 
or spot colors. To put it simply, process colors are made by mixing cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black to make colors, whereas spot colors are premixed 
before printing begins. Before you hand over your publication to a commer-
cial printer, find out which color system the printer prefers. It costs more to 
print with process colors than spot colors because process-color printing 
requires each color to be created on a different color plate. Process colors, 
however, produce color photographs much better than spot colors do.
Consult with the print shop where you intend to take your publication to 
find out which color model it prefers and take these steps before handing 
over your publication to the printer:

636
Commercially Printing a Publication
 
 
✦ Choose a color model: On the File tab, choose Info to go to the 
Information window. Then click the Commercial Print Settings button 
and choose Color Model. You see the Color Model dialog box. Choose a 
color definition setting and click OK.
 
✦ Manage embedded fonts: On the File tab, choose Info to open the 
Information window. Then click the Commercial Print Settings button 
and choose Manage Embedded Fonts. You see the Fonts dialog box. 
Click the Embed TrueType Fonts When Saving Publication check box to 
embed fonts. Whereas normally Publisher calls upon instructions from 
the computer to display fonts, embedding fonts make those instructions 
part of the file itself. These fonts display the same on all computers, 
including the computer your printer uses. Embedding fonts, however, 
makes files grow larger if your publication includes unusual fonts that 
the printer doesn’t have.
Preparing your file for a commercial printer
 
 Publisher offers the Pack and Go command for copying large files onto CDs 
and embedding fonts in a file. To use the Pack and Go command, go to the 
File tab, choose Save & Send, and choose Save for a Commercial Printer. 
Then, on the first drop-down list, choose Commercial Press, and on the 
second, choose Both PDF and Publisher .pub Files. Finally, click the Pack 
and Go Wizard button to burn your publication file to a CD or copy it to a 
removable storage device for use by the printer.

Chapter 1: Customizing 
an Office Program
In This Chapter
✓ Personalizing the Ribbon
✓ Changing around the Quick Access toolbar
✓ Choosing what appears on the status bar
✓ Choosing a new color scheme
✓ Devising keyboard shortcuts in Word
T
his chapter describes a handful of things you can do to customize Office 
2010 programs. Don’t be afraid to make like a software developer and 
change a program to your liking. Many people are wary of retooling Office 
programs, but you can always reverse the changes you make if you don’t 
like them, as I explain throughout this chapter.
This chapter shows how to put your favorite button commands on the 
Ribbon and Quick Access toolbar. Instead of fishing around for your favorite 
commands, you can assemble them on the Ribbon or Quick Access toolbar 
and locate them right away. You also discover how to change around the 
status bar, dress up an Office program in a new set of clothes, and designate 
your own keyboard shortcuts in Word.
Customizing the Ribbon
As you surely know by now, the Ribbon is the stretch of ground across the 
top of all Office programs. The Ribbon is composed of tabs. On each tab, 
commands are arranged by group. To undertake a task, you visit a tab on 
the Ribbon, find the group with the command you want, and choose the 
command. If you are so inclined, you can customize the Ribbon. You can 
place the tabs and commands you know and love where you want to find 
them on the Ribbon. And you can remove tabs and commands that aren’t 
useful to you.

640
Customizing the Ribbon
To customize the Ribbon, open the Customize Ribbon tab of the Options 
dialog box with one of these techniques:
 
 
✦ On the File tab, choose Options, and select the Customize Ribbon 
category in the Options dialog box.
 
✦ Right-click a tab or button and choose Customize the Ribbon.
You see commands for customizing the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1-1. The 
right side of the dialog box (“Customize the Ribbon”) lists the names of tabs, 
groups within tabs, and commands within groups that are currently on the 
Ribbon. To customize the Ribbon, you arrange the right side of the dialog 
box to your liking. You list the tabs, groups, and commands that you want 
for the Ribbon on the right side of the dialog box.

Office Program
641
Customizing the Ribbon
The left side of the dialog box (“Choose Commands From”) presents every 
tab, group, and command in your Office program. To customize the Ribbon, 
you select a tab, group, or command on the left side of the dialog box and 
move it to the right side.
Keep reading to find out how to display tabs, groups, and commands in the 
Options dialog box and how to do all else that pertains to customizing the 
Ribbon. In case you make a hash of the Ribbon, you also find instructions for 
restoring the Ribbon to its original state.
Displaying and selecting tab, 
group, and command names
To customize the Ribbon, you need to display and select tab names, group 
names, and command names in the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-1). 
Start by opening the drop-down lists and choosing a display option:
 
✦ Choose Commands From: Choose an option to locate the tab, group, 
or command you want to add to the Ribbon. For example, choose All 
Commands to see an alphabetical list of all the commands in the Office 
program you’re working in; choose Main Tabs to see a list of tabs.
 
✦ Customize the Ribbon: Choose an option to display the names of all 
tabs, main tabs, or tool tabs. Tool tabs are the context-sensitive tabs 
that appear after you insert or click something. For example, the Table 
Tools tabs appear when you construct tables.
After you choose display options on the drop-down lists, display the names 
of groups and commands (refer to Figure 1-1):
 
✦ Displaying group names: Click a plus sign icon next to a tab name to see 
the names of its groups. You can click the minus sign icon to fold group 
names back into a tab name.
 
✦ Displaying command names in groups: Click the plus sign icon next to a 
group name to see the names of its commands. You can click the minus 
sign icon to collapse command names.
After you display the tab, group, or command name, click to select it.
Moving tabs and groups on the Ribbon
To change the order of tabs on the Ribbon or groups on a tab, go to the 
Customize Ribbon category of the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-1) 
and select the name of a tab or group on the right side of the dialog box. 
Then click the Move Up or Move Down button. Click these buttons as neces-
sary until tabs or groups are in the order that you see fit.

642
Customizing the Ribbon
 
Be careful about moving groups by clicking the Move Up or Move Down 
button. Clicking these buttons too many times can move a group to a differ-
ent tab on the Ribbon.
Adding, removing, and renaming tabs, 
groups, and commands
In the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-1), display and select the tab, 
group, or command you want to add, remove, or rename. Then proceed to 
add, remove, or rename it. (Earlier in this chapter, “Displaying and select-
ing tab, group, and command names” explains how to display items in the 
Options dialog box.)
Adding items to the Ribbon
Follow these steps to add a tab, group, or command to the Ribbon:
 
1. On the left side of the Customize Ribbon tab of the Options dialog 
box, select the tab, group, or command you want to add.
 
 For example, to add the Tables group to the Home tab, select the 
Tables group.
 
2. On the right side of the dialog box, select the tab or group where you 
want to place the item.
 
 If you’re adding a tab to the Ribbon, select a tab. The tab you add will go 
after the tab you select.
 
3. Click the Add button.
Removing items from the Ribbon
Follow these steps to remove a tab, group, or command from the Ribbon:
 
1. On the right side of the Customize Ribbon tab of the Options dialog 
box, select the tab, group, or command you want to remove.
 
2. Click the Remove button.
 
 Except for tabs you create yourself, you can’t remove tabs from the 
Ribbon. And you can’t remove a command unless you remove it from a 
group you created yourself.
Renaming tabs and groups
Sorry, you can’t rename a command. As for tabs and groups, you can rename 
them, but only if you created them yourself. Tabs and groups that came with 
Office can’t be renamed. Follow these steps to rename a tab or group:
 
1. On the right side of the Customize Ribbon tab of the Options dialog 
box, select the tab or group you want to rename.

Book VIII
Chapter 1

Office Program
643

2. Click the Rename button.
 
 You see the Rename dialog box.
 
3. Enter a new name and click OK.
Creating new tabs and groups
Create new tabs and groups on the Ribbon for commands that are espe-
cially useful to you. Follow these steps on the Customize Ribbon tab of the 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-1) to create a new tab or group:
 
1. On the right side of the dialog box, display and select the name of a 
tab or group.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Displaying and selecting tab, group, and com-
mand names” explains how to select items in the Options dialog box.
 
• Tab: If you’re creating a tab, select a tab name. The tab you create 
will appear after the tab you select.
 
• Group: If you’re creating a group, select a group name. The group you 
create will appear after the group you select.
 
2. Click the New Tab or New Group button.
 
 Your Office program creates a new tab or group called “New Tab 
(Custom)” or “New Group (Custom).” If you created a tab, Office also 
creates a new group inside your new tab.
 
3. Click the Rename button to give the tab, group, or both a name.
 
 In the Rename dialog box, enter a descriptive name and click OK. If 
you’re naming a group, the Rename dialog box gives you the opportunity 
to select an icon to help identify the group.
 
4. Add groups, commands, or both to your newly made tab or group.
 
 For instructions, see “Adding items to the Ribbon,” earlier in this chapter.
Resetting your Ribbon customizations
If you make a hash of the Ribbon, all is not lost because you can restore the 
original settings. In the Options dialog box, click the Reset button (refer to 
Figure 1-1) and choose one of these commands on the drop-down list:
 
✦ Reset Only Selected Ribbon Tab: Select a tab name on the right side of 
the Options dialog box and choose this command to restore a tab to its 
original state.
 
✦ Reset All Customizations: Choose this command to restore the Ribbon 
in its entirety. All changes you made are reversed.
You can also remove tabs and groups you created if you discover you don’t 
need them. See “Removing items from the Ribbon,” earlier in this chapter.

644
Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
No matter where you go in Office, you see the Quick Access toolbar in the 
upper-left corner of the screen. This toolbar offers the Save, Undo, and 
Repeat buttons. However, which buttons appear on the Quick Access tool-
bar is entirely up to you. You can put your favorite buttons on the toolbar 
to keep them within reach. And if the Quick Access toolbar gets too big, you 
can move it below the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1-2. Adding buttons to and 
removing buttons from the Quick Access toolbar is, I’m happy to report, a 
piece of cake. And moving the toolbar below the Ribbon is as easy as pie.

You can preserve your Ribbon and Quick 
Access toolbar customizations for posterity in 
a special file called an Import Customization 
file; these files have the .exportedUI file 
extension. Keep the file on hand for when you 
need it, or distribute the file to co-workers. For 
that matter, a co-worker who is proud of his or 
her customizations can send them to you in a 
file and you can load the customizations into 
your Office program.
To save your Ribbon and Quick Access toolbar 
customization settings in a file, go to the File 
tab, choose Options, and visit the Customize 
Ribbon or Quick Access Toolbar category 
of the Options dialog box. Then click the 
Import/Export button and choose Export All 
Customizations on the drop-down list. The File 
Save dialog box opens. Give the customizations 
file a name and click the Save button.
To load customizations from a file into your 
Office program, return to the Customize 
Ribbon or Quick Access Toolbar category of 
the Options dialog box, click the Import/Export 
button, and choose Import Customization File. 
You see the File Open dialog box. Select the file 
and click the Open button.

Customizing the Status Bar
The status bar along the bottom of the window gives you information about 
the file you’re working on. The Word status bar, for example, tells you which 
page you’re on, how many pages are in your document, and several other 
things. In PowerPoint, the status bar tells you which slide you’re looking at 
and the theme you chose for your presentation. The status bar also presents 
the view buttons and Zoom controls.
To choose what appears on the status bar, right-click the status bar. You see 
a drop-down list similar to the one in Figure 1-4. By selecting and deselecting 
items in this list, you can decide what appears on the status bar.

Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts in Word
In Microsoft Word, you can change the keyboard shortcuts. A keyboard short-
cut is a combination of keys that you press to give a command. For example, 
pressing Ctrl+P opens the Print window; pressing Ctrl+S gives the Save com-
mand. If you don’t like a keyboard shortcut in Word, you can change it and 
invent a keyboard shortcut of your own. You can also assign keyboard short-
cuts to symbols, macros, fonts, AutoText entries, and styles.

Chapter 2: Ways of Distributing 
Your Work
In This Chapter
✓ Printing files
✓ Saving files so that others can read them in Adobe Acrobat Reader
✓ Sending a file by e-mail
✓ Saving a file so that it can be viewed in a Web browser
✓ Writing and keeping a blog from inside Word
T
his chapter explains how to distribute your work to co-workers and 
friends. You’ll be glad to know that people who don’t have Office 2010 
can still read and review an Office 2010 file you created. You can print it for 
them, save it so that it can be read in Adobe Acrobat Reader, or save it as a 
Web page. This chapter explains all that as well as how to send a file right 
away by e-mail and write and post blog entries from inside Word.
By the way, Book IV, Chapter 5 describes other ways to distribute PowerPoint 
presentations. You can provide audience handouts, ship presentations on 
CDs, and save presentations as video files.
Printing — the Old Standby
In spite of predictions to the contrary, the paperless office is still a pipe 
dream. The day when Johnny at his computer is completely digitized and 
communicating with his colleagues without having to print anything on 
paper has yet to materialize. As for Jane, she can hardly go a day without 
printing reports, spreadsheets, and brochures. The office is still awash in 
paper, and all Jane and Johnny can do for consolation is try their best to 
recycle.
 
 To print a file, preview a file before you print it, and do all else that pertains 
to printing, go to the File tab and choose Print (or press Ctrl+P). You land in 
the Print window, as shown in Figure 2-1. From here, you can choose how 
many copies to print, choose a part of a file to print, and get a look at your 
file before you print it. Notice that the Print window offers buttons for Zoom 
controls and buttons for going from page to page (or slide to slide).

Distributing a File in PDF Format
As shown in Figure 2-2, you can save and distribute a file in the PDF 
(Portable Document File) format if the person to whom you want to give 
the file doesn’t have the program with which it was created. For example, 
someone who doesn’t have Excel can still view your Excel file in PDF format. 
Moreover, you can post PDF files on the Internet so that others can view 
them there.
About PDF files
PDF files are designed to be viewed and printed in a program called Adobe 
Reader. This program is very good at acquiring data from other programs 
and presenting it so that it can be read and printed easily. Nearly every 
computer has Adobe Reader. If someone to whom you sent a PDF file doesn’t 
have the program, they can download it for free at this Web page:
http://get.adobe.com/reader/

Saving an Office file as a PDF
Follow these steps to save an Office file as a PDF file:
 
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Save & Send to open the Save & Send 
window.
 
2. Choose Create PDF/XPS Document.
 
3. Click the Create PDF/XPS button.
 
 The Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box appears. If your goal is to create 
an XPS file, not a PDF file, open the Save As Type drop-down list and 
choose XPS Document (*.xps). Microsoft created the XPS format to 
compete with the PDF format. As are PDF files, XPS files are meant to 
present data from different programs, in this case in Internet Explorer. 
However, the XPS format is not nearly as well known or frequently used 
as the PDF format.
 
4. Select a folder for storing your PDF (or XPS) file, give it a name, and 
click the Publish button.
 
 The Adobe Reader program opens and you see your file. (If you created 
an XPS file, Internet Explorer opens.)
Later in this chapter, “Saving an Office File as a Web Page” explains another 
way to distribute Office files to people who don’t have Office — by saving 
the files as Web pages.

Sending Your File in an E-Mail Message
Sending Your File in an E-Mail Message
As long as you handle your e-mail with Outlook 2010, you can send the file 
you’re working on to a friend or co-worker without having to open Outlook 
2010. Moreover, you can send a PDF or XPS version of the file. You simply 
choose a command and send the thing over the Internet. Follow these steps 
to send an open file you’re working on to a friend or co-worker:
 
 
1. Go to the File tab and choose Save & Send.
 
 
 The Save & Send window opens.
 
2. Choose Send Using E-Mail.
 
3. Choose a Send Using E-Mail option on the right side of the window.
 
 How do you want to send your file? Click one of these buttons:
 
• Send as Attachment: Send the file as an attachment to an e-mail message.
 
• Send a Link: Send an e-mail link with a hyperlink to the file on a 
shared workspace.
 
• Send as PDF: Send a PDF version of the file as an attachment to an 
e-mail message.
 
• Send as XPS: Send an XPS version of the file as an attachment to an 
e-mail message.
 
• Send as Internet Fax: Send the file as an Internet fax (you must have 
signed up with an Internet fax service provider).
 
 An Outlook 2010 message window appears with the name of your file on 
the subject line and the file itself in the Attach box. Your presentation is 
ready to send along with the e-mail message.
 
4. Enter the recipient’s address in the To box and a message in the 
Message box.
 
 Book III, Chapter 3 explains how to address, compose, and send e-mail 
messages with Outlook.
 
5. Click the Send button.
 
 That was fast! It was faster than opening Outlook and attaching the file 
to the e-mail message on your own.
Saving an Office File as a Web Page
Figure 2-3 shows what a Word document looks like after it is saved as a Web 
page and displayed in a Web browser. Looks like a normal Word document, 
doesn’t it? Anyone with a Web browser can view a Word document or other 
Office file after it’s saved as a Web page. Save an Office file as a Web page 
and post it on the Internet so that people who don’t have Office can view it.

Saving an Office File as a Web Page
 
Figure 2-3: 
A Word 
document

Web page, 
as seen 
through

of a Web 
browser.
 
These pages explain the different ways to save an Office file as a Web page, as 
well as how to save your Office file as a Web page and open a Web page you 
created in a Web browser.
Choosing how to save the component parts
When you save an Office file as a Web page, you have the choice of saving it 
as a Single File Web Page (.mht, .mhtml) or Web Page (.htm, .html).
 
✦ Single File Web Page (.mht, .mhtml): All component parts of the file — 
graphics, separate pages, and sounds, for example — are bundled into 
a single file. Keeping all the component parts in one file makes moving, 
copying, and sending the file easier. However, only the Internet Explorer 
browser can open and read .mht and .mhtml files. The popular Mozilla 
Firefox and Opera browsers can’t handle them.
 
✦ Web Page (.htm, .html): All the component parts of the file are kept 
in separate files and are saved in the same folder. Keeping the compo-
nent parts in separate files is the standard way to present pages on the 
Internet. Handling the half dozen or more files that are needed to display 
the Web page can be troublesome, but you can be certain that the Web 
page displays properly in all browsers.

656
Saving an Office File as a Web Page
Turning a file into a Web page
 
Before you save your file as a Web page, create a folder on your computer or 
computer network for storing the page if you intend to save it in several files 
in the .htm format. Unless you create a folder for storing all the files, you’ll 
have a hard time locating them later, and you must be able to locate them to 
transfer them to a Web server for display on the Internet or to send them to 
someone else.
Follow these steps to save an Office file as a Web page:
 
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Save & Send.
 
 
 The Save & Send window opens.
 
2. Choose Change File Type.
 
 Change File Type options appear on the right side of the window.
 
3. Save your file as a single file Web page or Web page.
 
 The previous topic in this chapter, “Choosing how to save the 
component parts,” explains the difference between the two.
 
• Single file Web page: Choose the Single File Web Page (*.mht, 
*.mhtml) option. The Save As dialog box opens.
 
• Web page: Choose the Save as Another File Type option, and when 
the Save As dialog box appears, open the Save as Type drop-down 
list and choose Web Page (*.htm; *.html).
 
4. In the Save As dialog box, click the Change Title button, enter a 
descriptive title in the Enter Text dialog box, and click OK.
 
 The title you enter will appear in the title bar along the top of the Web 
browser window.
 
5. Choose a folder for storing your new Web page.
 
 If you followed my advice about creating a Web page, choose the folder 
you recently created for storing the page and its attendant files.
 
6. Click the Save button.
 
 If your file includes features that can’t be displayed in a Web browser, 
the Compatibility Checker dialog box tells you what those features are. 
Click the Continue button to create your Web page.
Opening a Web page in your browser
To open a Web page you fashioned from an Office file, open the folder where 
you stored the Web page in Computer or Windows Explorer and double-click 
the .htm or .mht file. For example, if your file is called Sales Projections, 
double-click the Sales Projections.htm or Sales Projections.mht file to open 
the Web page.

Blogging from inside Word
Blogging from inside Word
The word blog is shorthand for Web log. A typical blog is a hodgepodge of 
commentary and links to online news sources and often other blogs where 
topics of concern to the blogger are discussed. Many blogs are online 
diaries. You get a daily picture of what the blogger is interested in — dating, 
technology, politics, and just about anything else under the sun.
To make it easier to keep a blog, Word offers special commands for writing 
blog entries and posting them immediately with a blogging service. Figure 2-4 
shows the blogging feature in action. The title and the blog entry in the 
Word document are transported in toto to the blog without your having to 
enter a password or even visit a blogging service. What’s more, Word offers 
a special Blog Post tab for posting blog entries and managing accounts with 
your blogging service. To take advantage of Word’s blogging feature, you 
must already have an account with a blogging service.

Describing a blog account to Word
Word can’t post entries to a blog unless you tell it where the blog is located, 
what your password is, and some other juicy tidbits. As of this writing, Word 
is compatible with these blogging services: Blogger, Community Server, 
Sharepoint Blog, TypePad, and WordPress.

658
Blogging from inside Word
Follow these steps to register your blogging account with Word so that 
Word can upload blog entries:
 
 1. Go to the File tab and choose Save & Send.
 
 
 The Save & Send window opens.
 
2. Choose Publish as Blog Post.
 
3. Click the Publish as Blog Post button.
 
 You see the Register a Blog Account dialog box.
 
4. Click the Register Now button and answer questions in the dialog box 
to describe the blogging service you use.
 
 Which questions you are asked depends on which blogging service you 
use. You’re asked for a username and password, and also perhaps an 
http or ftp address for publishing pictures on your blog.
After you finish describing your blogging service, you will be pleased to 
discover a new tab in Word — the Blog Post tab (refer to Figure 2-4). 
You can use this tab to post blog entries and manage your blog accounts. 
 
Posting an entry to your blog
When you’re ready to share your thoughts with the world, follow these steps 
to write and post an entry to your blog from inside Word:
 
1. In Word, write the entry from scratch or open a document you’ve 
already written.
 
 You can start from a new document, or if you’ve written the entry, open 
the Word document with the entry.
 
 2. Go to the File tab, choose Save & Send, choose Publish as Blog Post, 
and click the Publish as Blog Post button.
 
 You land in the Blog Post tab (refer to Figure 2-4). It offers all the 
character styles and proofing tools that you find in Word. Go to the 
Insert tab to enter a hyperlink. (Book I, Chapter 2 explains hyperlinks.)
 
3. Enter a title for your blog entry in the space provided.
 
 4. When you finish writing and preparing your blog entry, click the 
Publish button on the Blog Post tab.
 
 
 If all goes well, Word informs you that your post has been published on 
your blogging service, and it lists the time and date it was published. 
This information appears in the Word document itself.

Instead of publishing your blog entry right away, you can open the drop-
down list on the Publish button and choose Publish as Draft. Doing so 
uploads the blog entry to your blogging service without posting it. The entry 
lands on the Editing page, where you can select it, click the Editing button, 
and edit it online before publishing it.
Taking advantage of the Blog Post tab
By clicking buttons on the Blog Post tab, you can manage blog entries:
 
 
✦ Go to your blog page: Click the Home Page button to open your browser 
and display the home page of your blog.
 
 
✦ Edit a blog entry: Click the Open Existing button, and in the Open 
Existing Post dialog box, select a blog entry and click OK. The entry 
appears in Word. Edit it and click the Publish button to post it on your 
blog.
 
 
✦ Manage accounts: Click the Manage Accounts button to describe a new 
account to Word, change a blog account, or remove a blog account. 
Word provides the Blog Accounts dialog box for doing these activities.

✓ Understanding the different graphic file formats
✓ Placing a graphic in a Word document, PowerPoint slide, Excel work-
sheet, or Publisher publication
✓ Recoloring, cropping, and otherwise altering a picture
✓ Compressing graphics
✓ Handling graphics with Office Picture Manager
A
picture, so they say, is worth a thousand words. Whether it’s worth 
a thousand words or merely 950 is debatable. What is certain is 
that visuals help people remember things. A carefully chosen image in a 
PowerPoint presentation, Word document, Excel worksheet, or Publisher 
publication helps others understand you better. The image reinforces the 
ideas or information that you’re trying to put across.
This chapter explains how you can make pictures — photographs and 
graphics — part of your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel 
worksheets, and Publisher publications. It looks into graphic file formats, 
copyrights, and other issues pertaining to graphics as well as how to touch 
up graphics in an Office program and in an auxiliary program called Office 
Picture Manager.
By the way, the next chapter looks at another way to decorate your work 
with images. It looks at using clip art.
All about Picture File Formats
Graphics and photographs come in many different file formats, and as far as 
Office 2010 is concerned, some are better than others. These pages explain 
what you need to know about graphic files to use them wisely in Office files. 
Here, you find out what bitmap and vector graphics are, what resolution 
and color depth are, and how graphic files are compressed.

662
All about Picture File Formats
Bitmap and vector graphics
All graphic images fall in the bitmap or vector category:
 
✦ A bitmap graphic is composed of thousands upon thousands of tiny dots 
called pixels that, taken together, form an image (the term pixel comes 
from “picture element”).
 
✦ A vector graphic is drawn with the aid of computer instructions that 
describe the shape and dimension of each line, curve, circle, and so on.
The major difference between the two formats is that vector graphics do 
not distort when you enlarge or shrink them, whereas bitmap graphics lose 
resolution when their size is changed. Furthermore, vector images do not 
require nearly as much hard drive space as bitmap graphics. Drop a few 
bitmap graphics in a file and soon you’re dealing with a file that is close to 
750K in size.
Table 3-1 describes popular bitmap graphic formats; Table 3-2 lists popular 
vector graphic formats.

Resolution
Resolution refers to how many pixels comprise a bitmap image. The higher 
the resolution, the clearer the image is. Resolution is measured in dots per 
inch (dpi), sometimes called pixels per inch (ppi). Images with more dots (or 
pixels) per inch are clearer and display more fineness of detail. When you 
scan an image, your scanner permits you to choose a dots-per-inch setting.
High-resolution images look better but require more hard drive space than 
low-resolution images. Figure 3-1 illustrates the difference between a high- 
and low-resolution photograph.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A high-
resolution 
photo (left) 
and the 
same photo 
at low 
resolution 
(right).
 
Compression
Compression refers to a mathematical algorithm by which bitmap graphic 
files can be made smaller. In effect, compression enables your computer 
to store a bitmap graphic with less hard drive space. Some bitmap graphic 
types can’t be compressed; the other bitmap graphic types are compressed 
using either lossless or lossy compression:

664
The All-Important Copyright Issue
 
✦ Lossless compression: To maintain the picture’s integrity, the same 
number of pixels is stored in the compressed file as in the original. 
Because the pixels remain intact, you can change the size of a file that 
has undergone lossless compression without losing picture quality.
 
✦ Lossy compression: Without regard for the picture’s integrity, pixel data 
in the original picture is lost during compression. Therefore, if you try 
to enlarge a picture that has undergone lossy compression, the picture 
loses quality.
Choosing file formats for graphics
 
One of the challenges of using graphics and photographs in Office files 
is keeping file sizes to a minimum. A file that is loaded down with many 
photographs can take a long time to load and send over the Internet because 
graphics and photographs make files that much larger. The trick is to find a 
balance between high-quality, high-resolution graphics and the need to keep 
files sizes low. Here are some tips for choosing graphic file formats:
 
✦ Consider sticking with vector graphics if you’re including graphics in 
your file strictly for decoration purposes. As Chapter 4 of this mini-
book explains, Office provides vector clip-art images. These images are 
easy to come by, don’t require very much hard drive space, and can be 
edited inside Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher.
 
✦ For photographs, make JPEG your first choice for graphics. JPEG images 
have a fairly high resolution. If you intend to post your file on the 
Internet, you can’t go wrong with JPEGs; they are the de facto photograph 
standard on the Internet.
 
✦ If you’re dealing with black-and-white photos or resolution doesn’t 
matter, use GIF files. These files eat up the least amount of hard drive 
space.
The All-Important Copyright Issue
To save any image on the Internet to your computer, all you have to do is 
right-click it and choose Save Picture As. By starting from Google Image 
Search (www.images.google.com), you can scour the Internet for any 
image you need. Never before has it been easier to obtain images for your 
own use.
Still, obtaining images and using them legally are two different matters. 
Would it surprise you to know that the vast majority of graphics can’t be 
used without the owner’s permission? The copyright laws have a “fair use” 
provision for borrowing written words. You can quote others’ words as long 
as you cite the author and work and you don’t quote passages longer than 
250 to a thousand words (the “fair use” provision is vague on this point). 

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Handling Graphics
665
Inserting a Picture in an Office File
The copyright law regarding graphics is quite straightforward. Unless you 
have the owner’s permission, you can’t legally use a graphic.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell who owns a graphic. The artist or photographer 
(or his or her estate) doesn’t necessarily own the copyright because artists 
sometimes relinquish their copyrights when they create works for hire. The 
only way to get permission to use a graphic is to ask. Contact the owner of 
the Web site with the image you want, the publisher if the image is in a book, 
or the museum if the work is owned by a museum. You will be asked to write 
a letter describing precisely how you intend to use the image, reproduce it, 
and distribute it. Your letter should also say how long you intend to use it 
and at what size you intend to reproduce it.
Inserting a Picture in an Office File
After you’ve weighed the merits of different kinds of graphics and decided 
which one is best for you, you can insert it. Inserting a picture is as simple 
as choosing it in the Insert Picture dialog box. Follow these steps to insert 
a picture on a PowerPoint slide, Word document, Excel worksheet, or 
Publisher page:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 2. Click the Picture button.
 
 
 You see the Insert Picture dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2. In 
PowerPoint, you can also open this dialog box by clicking the picture 
icon in a content placeholder frame.

 You can click the File Types button to open a drop-down list and choose 
a file type to locate files of a certain type in the dialog box. Move the 
pointer over a picture in the dialog box to get information about its file 
type, dimensions, and size.
 
4. Click the Insert button.
 
 Select the (Picture Tools) Format tab to see all the different ways you 
can manipulate a picture after you insert it.
After a picture lands on a file, it becomes an object. Book I, Chapter 8 
explains how to manipulate objects — how to move them, change their size, 
and change their borders. Later in this chapter, “Touching Up a Picture” 
looks into various ways to change the appearance of graphics.
 
 If you chose the wrong picture, don’t fret because you can exchange one 
picture for another. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Change 
Picture button and select a different picture in the Insert Picture dialog box.
Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook make it 
easier than ever to take a picture of a screen 
on your computer and insert it in a document, 
slide, worksheet, or e-mail message. Follow 
these steps to take a picture of a screen:
 1. If you want to capture a portion of one 
screen, open the screen.
 2. On the Insert tab, click the Screenshot 
button.
 
 A drop-down list shows you thumbnail 
images of each screen that is open on your 
computer.
 3. Choose a thumbnail image to shoot an 
entire screen, or choose Screen Clipping 
and drag on-screen to shoot a portion of a 
screen.
A picture of the screen or a portion of 
the screen lands in your document, slide, 
worksheet, or e-mail message.
Here are a couple of other tried-and-true 
techniques for capturing screens:
 ✓ Press PrtScn (that is, the Print Screen key 
to the right of F12) to capture an entire 
screen to the Clipboard.
 ✓ Press Alt+PrtScn to capture the active part 
of the screen to the Clipboard. For example, 
to capture a dialog box, select the dialog 
box and press Alt+PrtScn.
After the screen capture is on the Clipboard, 
you can paste it where you will.

Touching Up a Picture
Every picture can be a collaboration. You can do the following to make a 
picture your own as well as the work of the original artist:
 
✦ Softening and sharpening: Mute or polish a picture. See “Softening and 
sharpening pictures,” later in this chapter.
 
✦ Changing the brightness and contrast: Adjust a picture’s tone. See 
“Correcting a picture’s brightness and contrast.”
 
✦ Recoloring: Give your picture a brand-new set of colors or gray shades. 
See “Recoloring a picture.”
 
✦ Choosing an artistic effect: Take your picture for a walk on the wild 
side. See “Choosing an artistic effect.”
 
✦ Choosing a picture style: Present your picture in an oval fame, soft-edged 
frame, or other type of frame. See “Selecting a picture style.”
 
✦ Cropping: Cut out the parts of a picture that you don’t want. See 
“Cropping off part of a picture.”
 
✦ Removing picture areas: Keep the essentials of a picture and remove 
the rest. See “Removing the background.”
To touch up a picture, visit the (Picture Tools) Format tab. As shown in 
Figure 3-3, you can also open the Format Picture dialog box and choose 
settings in these categories: Picture Corrections, Picture Color, Artistic 
Effects, and Crop. To open the Format Picture dialog box, right-click a 
picture and choose Format Picture on the shortcut menu.

 If you regret experimenting with your picture and you want to start all over, 
go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab and click the Reset Picture button. 
Clicking this button restores a picture to its original condition.
 
PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Publisher offer only a handful of tools for 
changing a picture’s appearance. If you have the time and the inclination, 
alter a graphic’s appearance in a program designed especially for that 
purpose. You can find many more options for editing graphics in Photoshop, 
Paint Shop Pro, and Corel Photo-Paint, for example. Later in this chapter, 
“Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager” describes a nifty program that 
comes with Office for editing pictures.
Softening and sharpening pictures
Figure 3-4 shows the effects of the softening/sharpening settings. These 
settings mute a picture or make it look more succinct. To soften or sharpen 
a picture, select it and use one of these techniques:
 
 
✦ On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Corrections button and 
choose a Sharpen and Soften option on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Open the Format Picture dialog box to the Picture Corrections category 
and drag the Soften-Sharpen slider or enter a negative or positive 
number in the text box. Negative numbers soften the picture; positive 
numbers sharpen it. To open the Format Picture dialog box, right-click 
your picture and choose Format Picture.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Effects 
of the 
softening/
sharpening 
settings.
 
Correcting a picture’s brightness and contrast
Figure 3-5 shows a picture that has been made over several times with the 
Brightness and Contrast settings. Brightness settings govern the overall 
brightness of a picture; contrast settings determine how distinguishable 
the different parts of the picture are from one another. Change a picture’s 
brightness and contrast to make it fit better on a page or slide. Select your 
picture and use one of these techniques:

✦ On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Corrections button and 
choose a Brightness and Contrast option on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Open the Format Picture dialog box to the Picture Corrections category 
and change the Brightness and Contrast settings. Negative Brightness 
settings make a picture darker; positive settings make it brighter. 
Negative Contrast settings mute the differences between the parts of a 
picture; positive settings heighten the differences. To open the Format 
Picture dialog box, right-click your picture and choose Format Picture.

Recoloring a picture
Recolor a picture to give it a makeover. Figure 3-6 shows examples of Recolor 
options. As well as recoloring a picture, you can change its color saturation 
and color tone settings. Color saturation refers to the purity and intensity 
of the colors; color tone determines the degree of lightness and darkness. 
Recoloring is useful for giving a picture a uniform appearance. Select your 
picture and use these techniques to recolor it:
 
 
✦ On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Color button and choose a 
Color Saturation, Color Tone, or Recolor option on the drop-down list. 
You can choose More Variations at the bottom of the list and choose a 
color on the sublist.
 
✦ Open the Format Picture dialog box to the Picture Color category 
and change the Color Saturation and Color Tone settings. Change 
the Saturation setting to mute or bring out the colors; change the 
Temperature setting to make the color tones darker or lighter. To open 
the Format Picture dialog box, right-click your picture and choose 
Format Picture.

Live-previewing really comes in handy when you’re recoloring a graphic. 
Move the Format Picture dialog box to the side of your picture and watch 
what happens when you change the Picture Color settings.
Choosing an artistic effect
Figure 3-7 demonstrates four of the 23 artistic effects that you can apply to a 
picture: Pencil Sketch, Glow Diffused, Glass, and Glow Edges. To experiment 
with the artistic effects and maybe find one to your liking, select your picture 
and use one of these techniques:
 
 
✦ Go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Artistic Effects button, 
and choose an effect on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Open the Format Picture dialog box to the Artistic Effects category and 
choose an artistic effect. To open the Format Picture dialog box, right-
click your picture and choose Format Picture.
The (Picture Tools) Format tab offers the Set 
Transparent Color command for making one 
color in a picture transparent and thereby 
allowing the background to show through in 
certain parts of a picture. The Set Transparent 
Color command works by making all the pixels 
in a picture that are the same color transparent. 
In a picture in which one color predominates, 
you can make this color transparent and get 
some interesting effects.
To experiment with the Set Transparent Color 
command:
 1. Select the picture.
 2. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the 
Color button and choose Set Transparent 
Color on the drop-down list.
 3. Click in your picture on the color that you 
want to be transparent.
You can choose the Set Transparent Color 
command again and make another color in 
your picture transparent.

your format changes and start over.
If you like the picture styles, you may be enamored as well with the picture 
effects. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Picture Effects button 
and experiment with the options on the drop-down list and sublists.

Cropping off part of a picture
Cropping means to cut off part of a picture. I’m afraid you can’t use the Office 
cropping tool like a pair of scissors or an Xacto knife to zigzag cut around 
the edges of a picture or cut a hole in the middle. You can, however, cut 
strips from the side, top, or bottom. In Figure 3-9, the cropping tool is being 
used to cut off extraneous parts of a picture.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Cropping off 
parts of a 
picture.
 
Select your picture, go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab, and use one of 
these techniques to crop it:
 
 
✦ Crop manually: Crop the picture by dragging its cropping handles. Click 
the Crop button. Cropping handles appear around the picture, as in 
Figure 3-9. Drag cropping handles to lop off a part or parts of the picture. 
Click the Crop button again or press Esc after you finish cropping.
 
✦ Crop to a shape: Crop the picture to a rectangle, circle, or other shape. 
Open the drop-down list on the Crop button, choose Crop to Shape, and 
select a shape in the Shapes gallery.
 
✦ Crop to proportions: Crop the picture to a proportional size setting. 
Open the drop-down list on the Crop button, choose Aspect Ratio, and 
choose a ratio. For example, choose 1:1 to crop to a perfect square with 
the width and height the same size.
 
✦ Crop by filling: For placing an image in a picture placeholder, crop the 
image to make it fit in the placeholder box.
 
✦ Crop by fitting: For placing an image in a picture placeholder, shrink the 
picture to make it fit.
 
With the cropping handles showing, you can drag the picture left, right, up, 
or down to determine where it is cropped.
Another way to crop pictures is to click the Size group button on the 
(Picture Tools) Format tab and enter measurements in the Crop category of 
the Format Picture dialog box. Use this method if you need to crop several 
different pictures in the same manner.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Handling Graphics
673
Touching Up a Picture
 
When you crop a picture, you don’t cut off a part of it — not as far as your 
computer is concerned. All you do is tell Office not to display part of a 
graphic. The graphic is still whole. You can, however, compress a graphic 
after you crop it, and in so doing truly shave off a part of the graphic and 
thereby decrease the size of the file you’re working with, as “Compressing 
Pictures to Save Hard Drive Space” explains later in this chapter.
Removing the background
Yet another way to diddle with pictures is to use the Remove Background 
command. This command endeavors to locate the unessential parts of a 
picture so that you can remove them, which sometimes means removing the 
foreground or the background, as shown in Figure 3-10. Select a picture and 
follow these steps to test-drive the Remove Background command:
 
 1. On the (Picture Tools) Format tab, click the Remove Background 
button.
 
 
 The Background Removal tab opens and the parts of your picture that 
Office wants to remove turn a lurid shade of magenta, which you could 
see in the middle of Figure 3-10 if this book were in color.
 
Figure 3-10: 
Removing 
parts of a

this case

2. On the Background Removal tab, indicate what you want to keep and 
remove.

674
Compressing Pictures to Save Hard Drive Space
 
 Keep your eye on what’s magenta and what’s not as you use these 
techniques, and consider zooming to 200 percent or more so that you 
can get a good look at your picture:
 
• Changing the size of the box: Drag the side and corner handles of the 
box to capture what you want to keep or remove.
 
• Marking what you want to keep: Click the Mark Areas to Keep button. 
The pointer changes into a pencil. Click your picture to indicate what 
you want to keep. Each time you click, a keep mark (a plus sign icon) 
appears on your picture.
 
• Marking what you want to remove: Click the Mark Areas to Remove 
button. The pointer changes to a pencil. Click your picture to indicate 
what you want to remove. When you click, a remove mark (a minus 
sign) appears.
 
• Deleting keep and remove marks: Click the Delete Mark button and 
then click a keep or remove mark to remove a mark and change what 
is and isn’t removed from the picture.
 
 Of course, you can click the Undo button to backtrack as you work. 
If you get thoroughly lost on the Background Removal tab, click the 
Discard All Changes button and start all over.
 
 3. Click the Keep Changes button when you finish marking what you 
want to keep and remove.
 
 
 How do you like your picture now? If it needs more work, click the 
Remove Background button again and diddle some more on the 
Background Removal tab. Click the Discard All Changes button if you 
want your original picture without the background removed.
Compressing Pictures to Save Hard Drive Space
By compressing pictures, you reduce their file size and consequently 
the size of the file you’re working on. Not all pictures can be compressed, 
as “Compression” explains earlier in this chapter, and some types of 
graphics lose their integrity when they’re compressed. You can’t resize 
lossy-compressed graphics without their looking odd.
Compress pictures to make files load faster and make e-mail messages with 
file attachments travel faster over the Internet. Compressing a picture file 
reduces its pixels per inch (ppi) setting. Follow these steps to compress 
pictures:
 
1. Optionally, select the picture or pictures you want to compress if you 
want to compress only one or two.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Handling Graphics
675
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
 
 The Compress Pictures command compresses all the graphics in a file 
unless you select graphics first.
 
2. Go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab.
 
 3. Click the Compress Pictures button.
 
 
 You see the Compress Pictures dialog box.
 
4. Select the Apply to Selected Pictures Only check box if you selected 
graphics in Step 1 and you want to compress only a couple of graphics.
 
5. Click the Delete Cropped Areas of Pictures check box if you want to 
delete the unused portions of pictures you cropped.
 
 As “Cropping off part of a picture” explains earlier in this chapter, Office 
crops graphics in name only. It retains the cropped part of the graphic 
in case you want it back, but you can remove the cropped part as well 
by selecting this check box.
 
6. Choose a target output for the pictures.
 
 These options tell Office which pixels per inch (ppi) setting to use when 
compressing graphics. Which setting you choose depends on where 
you intend to show your graphics. Graphics to be shown on a computer 
monitor need be no more than 72 ppi. If you intend to print your graphics, 
choose a setting in the 600–3000 ppi range. To print for an offset 
publication, choose an even higher setting.
 
7. Click OK.
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
You may not know it, but you installed a program for managing and editing 
pictures when you installed Office. The program is called Microsoft Office 
Picture Manager, and you can use it to organize graphics and touch up 
graphics before inserting them in a PowerPoint, Word, Excel, or Publisher 
file. As shown in Figure 3-11, Picture Manager displays graphics so that you 
can see precisely what your editorial changes do to them. The program 
makes it easy to find and organize graphic files on your computer. It also 
provides tools for editing graphics.
To open Picture Manager, click the Start button and choose All Programs➪
Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office 2010 Tools➪Microsoft Office Picture 
Manager. You see the window shown in Figure 3-11. Starting there, you can 
display a graphic on your computer and change its appearance in several 
different ways.

Mapping the graphic files on your computer
The first step in using the Picture Manager is to point to the folders on your 
computer where important graphic files are located. After you tell Picture 
Manager which folders graphic files are kept in, shortcuts to the folders 
appear in the Picture Shortcuts pane on the left side of the window (refer to 
Figure 3-11). By clicking one of these shortcuts, you can open a folder, view 
its contents, and edit a graphic file.
Follow these steps to create shortcuts to folders in the Picture Shortcuts 
pane:
 
1. Choose File➪Add Picture Shortcut or click the Add Picture Shortcut 
link in the Picture Shortcuts pane (click the Shortcuts button to see 
this pane).
 
 The Add Picture Shortcut dialog box opens.
 
2. Select a folder where you store graphics that you want to work with.
 
3. Click the Add button.
 
 Repeat these steps until you’ve created shortcuts to folders where you 
store important graphics.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Handling Graphics
677
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
 
Instead of pointing to folders one at a time, you can choose File➪Locate 
Pictures and have Picture Manager scour your computer or network for 
the graphic file types you select in the File Types dialog box. Shortcuts to 
folders with those file types appear in the Picture Shortcuts task pane. If you 
go this route, however, you’ll likely discover many, many folders on your 
computer where graphic files are kept, and shortcuts to these folders will 
crowd the Picture Shortcuts task pane.
Click the Shortcuts button (or choose View➪Shortcuts) to display the 
Picture Shortcuts task pane. To remove a shortcut from the task pane, 
right-click it and choose Remove Shortcut.
Displaying the graphic file you want to work with
After you’ve created shortcuts to the folders where you keep graphic files, 
you can display a graphic file by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Shortcuts button, if necessary, to display the Picture 
Shortcuts task pane.
 
2. Click a shortcut to a folder.
 
 Graphic files in the folder appear in the middle window (refer to 
Figure 3-11).
 
3. Scroll to or choose a different view to pinpoint the file.
 
 Picture Manager offers three views: Thumbnails, Filmstrip, and Single 
Picture. Choose an option on the View menu or click a View button to 
change views (refer to Figure 3-11).
 
Double-click a thumbnail image to see a graphic in Single Picture view. To 
zoom in and out, drag the Zoom Slider.
Editing a picture
With the graphic you want to edit on display, you’re ready to start editing. 
Your next task is to display the editing tools you need on the right side of 
the window. Picture Manager offers two ways to get the editing tools you 
need:
 
✦ Click the Edit Pictures button to display the Edit Pictures task pane. It 
lists the names of editing tools. Click the link that represents the kind 
of editing you want to do. For example, to crop a graphic, click the 
Crop link.
 
✦ Open the Picture menu and choose Brightness and Contrast, Color, 
Crop, Rotate and Flip, Red Eye Removal, Resize, or Compress Pictures. 
For example, choose Picture➪Crop to cut off part of a graphic.

678
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
To let Picture Manager try its hand at improving your graphic, click the 
AutoCorrect button (or choose Picture➪AutoCorrect).
 
If you regret making changes to a graphic, choose Edit➪Discard Changes. All 
changes you made are reversed and you get your original graphic back.
Click the Save button (or press Ctrl+S) to save your graphic after you finish 
editing it. For that matter, choose File➪Save As before you start editing and 
save the file under a new name so that you have the original in reserve.
 
If you edit one picture and go to another without saving the first one, Picture 
Manager takes notice. Copies of unsaved files are kept in the Unsaved Edits 
folder. To see the contents of this folder, click Unsaved Edits in the Picture 
Shortcuts task pane. Unsaved graphics appear on-screen so that you can 
select and save them, if you so choose.
Adjusting the brightness and contrast
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Brightness and Contrast or click the 
Brightness and Contrast hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane to adjust a 
graphic’s tonal intensity. You see a Brightness, Contrast, and Midtone slider 
on the Brightness and Contrast task pane. Without going into too much 
detail, here is what these sliders do:
 
✦ Brightness: Adjusts the inherent brightness value in each pixel. 
Increasing the brightness makes the image lighter; decreasing it makes 
the image darker.
 
✦ Contrast: Increasing the contrast, in the words of a laundry detergent 
manufacturer, “makes your whites whiter and your darks darker,” 
whereas decreasing the contrast making the tones more similar.
 
✦ Midtone: Redefines the midtones, or tonal values between light and 
shadow, of an image. Dragging the slider to the right brightens the 
image.
If dragging the sliders doesn’t provide the results you want, say the heck 
with it and just click the Auto Brightness button to let Picture Manager 
adjust the brightness and contrast for you.
Balancing the colors
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Color or click the Color hyperlink in 
the Edit Pictures task pane to fine-tune a graphic’s colors.
You can have Picture Manager do the fine-tuning for you. Click the Enhance 
Color button and then click a part of the graphic that is supposed to be 
white. If you don’t like the results, try balancing the colors in the graphic 
yourself by dragging these three sliders:

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Handling Graphics
679
Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
 
✦ Amount: Increasing this value magnifies the hue and saturation settings; 
decreasing this value minimizes them.
 
✦ Hue: Increasing this value further distinguishes the colors from one 
another; decreasing this value makes the colors blend.
 
✦ Saturation: Increasing it makes colors more luminous; decreasing this 
value makes colors grayer.
Cropping a graphic
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Crop or click the Crop hyperlink in the 
Edit Pictures task pane to cut off parts of a graphic. Picture Manager shows 
precisely how much of the graphic you will crop when you click OK. The 
Crop task pane is especially useful if you want your graphic to be a certain 
size. Under Picture Dimensions, you can see exactly how many pixels high 
and wide your graphic is. By dragging the selected part of the graphic — the 
part that isn’t grayed out — you can be very precise about what part of the 
graphic remains after you crop.
The Crop task pane offers two ways to crop a graphic:
 
✦ Crop at will: In the Aspect Ratio drop-down list, choose None and then 
drag a corner or side cropping handle.
 
✦ Maintain symmetry when you crop: Choose an option from the Aspect 
Ratio drop-down list and select the Landscape or Portrait option 
button before you drag a corner or side cropping handle. Aspect ratio 
proportionally describes the relationship between a graphic’s width 
and height. For example, at the 4 x 6 aspect ratio, the graphic in Portrait 
mode is a third taller than it is wide (4⁄6); in Landscape mode, the graphic 
is a third wider than it is tall. Choose an aspect ratio setting when you 
want your graphic to have symmetry.
Cropping a graphic doesn’t reduce its file size. To reduce a graphic’s file size 
after you’ve cropped it, compress the graphic. See “Compressing a graphic,” 
later in this chapter.
Rotating and flipping graphics
Select a graphic and choose Picture➪Rotate and Flip, or click the Rotate and 
Flip hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane to rotate or flip graphics. The 
Rotate commands turn the graphic on its side; the Flip commands provide 
mirror images of the original graphic. You can rotate a graphic by degrees 
by entering a value in the By Degree text box. The Formatting toolbar also 
offers Rotate buttons for rotating graphics.

Removing “red eyes” from a graphic
Sometimes the subject of a photo appears to have red eyes, not because 
the subject didn’t get enough sleep, but because the camera flash made the 
subject’s irises turn red. Follow these steps to remove red eye from a digital 
flash photograph:
 
1. Choose Picture➪Red Eye Removal or click the Red Eye Removal 
hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane.
 
2. Drag the Zoom slider to the right so that you get a good look at the red 
eyes in the photo.
 
3. Click each red eye to select it.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 You can click the Reset Selected Eyes button to start all over, if you 
need to do that.
Resizing a graphic
To change the size of a graphic, select it and choose Picture➪Resize or click 
the Resize hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane. You land in the Resize 
task pane. It offers three ways to change the size of a graphic:
 
✦ Predefined Width x Height: Select this option button, and on the 
drop-down list, choose the setting that best describes the graphic’s size. 
For example, if you intend to post the graphic on a Web page, choose 
Web - Large or Web - Small.
 
✦ Custom Width x Height: Select this option button and enter pixel 
measurements for the width and height of the graphic. Be careful with 
this option because the graphic doesn’t maintain its original proportions 
unless you calculate the proportions yourself, and when a resized 
graphic loses its original proportions, it can be skewed or blurred.
 
✦ Percentage of Original Width x Height: Select this option button 
and enter the percentage by which you want to enlarge or shrink the 
graphic.
The bottom of the task pane tells you how many pixels wide and high your 
graphic was to start with and how wide and high it is after resizing.
Compressing a graphic
Near the beginning of this chapter, “Compression” explains what compressing 
a graphic entails. Compress a graphic to reduce its file size. Compressing 
a graphic file reduces its pixels per inch (ppi) setting. Some graphic types, 
however, can’t be compressed.

Using Microsoft Office Picture Manager
To compress a graphic, select it and choose Picture➪Compress Pictures or 
click the Compress Pictures hyperlink in the Edit Pictures task pane. You see

with Clip Art
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what clip art is
✓ Placing a clip-art image on a page, slide, or worksheet
✓ Changing the look of a clip-art image
✓ Using the Clip Organizer to store, organize, and insert clip art
T
his chapter explains how you can use clip art to decorate Word documents, 
PowerPoint slides, Excel worksheets, and Publisher publications. You 
also find a treatise on how to use the Microsoft Clip Organizer, an auxiliary 
program for storing clip art and other kinds of media files so that you can 
find the files in a hurry. If you often use media files in your work, you owe it 
to yourself to look into the Clip Organizer.
What Is Clip Art?
In the old days, long before the invention of computers, people would buy 
clip-art books. They would literally cut, or clip, images from these books 
and paste them into posters, letters, and advertisements. Today’s clip art 
is the digital equivalent of old-fashioned clip art. You can paste clip art into 
computer programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher. You 
can resize clip-art images without the images losing their integrity. The clip 
art that comes with Office 2010 isn’t encumbered by licensing restrictions; 
it’s in the public domain, and you can use it as you please.
Figure 4-1 shows examples of some clip-art images that come with Office. 
Use images like these to decorate your files. Use them to help illustrate an 
idea or simply to add a little liveliness to your work. In my experience, the 
hardest task where clip art is concerned is finding the right image. You can 
choose from so many images that finding the right one is a chore.

Organizer for the image you want, and insert the image. The trick to finding 
the right image is knowing your way around the Clip Organizer. The majority 
of this chapter explains how to organize the art on your computer so that 
you can get it by way of the Clip Organizer. For now, you can follow these 
basic steps to insert a clip-art image in a page, slide, or worksheet:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 2. Click the Clip Art button.
 
 
 You see the Clip Art task pane, as shown in Figure 4-2. In PowerPoint, 
you can also click the Clip-Art icon to insert a clip-art image in a content 
placeholder frame.
 
 The Clip Art task pane is actually an entrée into the Clip Organizer, the 
Microsoft program for organizing and quickly inserting clip art. (The 
Clip Organizer is explained in more detail later in “Handling Media Files 
with the Clip Organizer.”)
 
3. In the Search For text box, enter a keyword that describes the clip-art 
image you need.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Searching for a media file in the Search pane” 
explains how keywords work.
 
4. Select the Include Office.com content check box (and make sure that 
your computer is connected to the Internet) to search for images 
online as well as on your computer.
 
5. In the Results Should Be drop-down list, choose Illustrations, and if 
you want to search for photos as well, choose Photographs (refer to 
Figure 4-2).

7.  Double-click an image or open its drop-down list and choose Insert to 
place it in your Word document, PowerPoint slide, Excel worksheet, 
or Publisher publication.
 
 Your next task is to move the image into position and perhaps change 
its size. Book I, Chapter 8 explains how to manipulate clip-art images 
and other objects.
Tinkering with a Clip-Art Image’s Appearance
Sometimes a clip-art image doesn’t sit well with the rest of the page, slide, 
or worksheet. The image is too bright or too dark. It clashes with the other 
images. When an image clashes, you don’t have to abandon it in favor of 
another image. As Figure 4-3 shows, you can alter a clip-art image’s appearance 
in different ways.

Select your image, go to the (Picture Tools) Format tab, and change the 
image’s appearance. Chapter 3 of this mini-book describes the different ways 
to touch up a picture or clip-art image.

Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
As computers get faster and better, media files — clip art, graphics, video 
clips, and audio files — will play a bigger role in computing. Dropping a 
clip-art image in a Word document or PowerPoint slide won’t be a big deal. 
Playing video clips on PowerPoint slides will be commonplace.
Well aware that the future is closing in on us, Microsoft created the Clip 
Organizer to help you manage the media files on your computer. By using 
the Clip Organizer, you can place graphics, video clips, and audio files 
in Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel worksheets, and 
Publisher publications. More important, the Clip Organizer is the place to 
organize media files in your computer so that you can find them and make 
good use of them. These pages explain how to manage the Clip Organizer.
To open the Clip Organizer, click the Start button and choose All Programs➪
Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office 2010 Tools➪Microsoft Clip Organizer.
Knowing your way around the Clip Organizer
As shown in Figure 4-4, the Clip Organizer is divided in two parts, with a 
pane on the left and a window for displaying files on the right. The Clip 
Organizer offers two panes: Collection List and Search.
 
✦ Collection List task pane: Use the Collection List task pane to organize 
your media files and to quickly locate and insert a media file. To display 
the Collection List task pane, click the Collection List button or choose 
View➪Collection List.
 
✦ Search task pane: Use the Search task pane to locate a media file on 
your computer. Notice that this task pane is similar to the Clip Art task 
pane in Office programs (refer to Figure 4-2). To display the Search task 
pane, click the Search button or choose View➪Search.

Locating the media file you need
The Clip Organizer presents two ways to find a media file you need. Starting 
from the Search pane, you can conduct a keyword search; starting from the 
Collection List pane, you can select folders and subfolders to display clip art 
and other media files on the right side of the window.
Searching for a media file in the Search pane
By entering a keyword in the Search For text box, telling the Clip Organizer 
where to look, and telling it what kind of files to look for, you can pinpoint 
the clip-art image you need:
 
✦ Search For text box: Enter a keyword that describes what kind of 
clip-art image you want. As Figure 4-5 shows, each clip-art image has 
been assigned descriptive keywords. If the keyword you enter matches 
a keyword assigned to a clip-art image, the image appears in the search 
results. (To view an image’s keywords, open its drop-down list and 
choose Preview/Properties.)
 
✦ Results Should Be: Choose which type of media you’re seeking — 
illustrations, photographs, videos, or audio.

688
Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
 
✦ Include Office.com Content: Select this check box (and make sure that 
your computer is connected to the Internet) to search for images online 
as well as on your computer.
Click the Go button when you’re ready to conduct the search. The results of 
the search appear on the right side of the window (see to Figure 4-5).
 
Figure 4-5:

Locating a media file in the Collection List
If you know that the media file you want is stored on your computer, you can 
find it by starting with the Collection List.
The folders in the Collection List pane work just the same as folders in 
Windows Explorer or Computer. Click a folder name to display its contents 
on the right side of the screen. Display or hide subfolders by clicking the 
plus sign (+) or minus sign (–) next to folder names.
When you select a folder (or subfolder) in the Collection List pane, its 
contents appear on the right side of the Clip Organizer window (refer to 
Figure 4-4). These are the top-level folders in the Collection List pane:

Book VIII
Chapter 4
Decorating Files 
with Clip Art
689
Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
 
✦ My Collections: Includes the Favorites subfolder (where you can store 
media files you use most often), subfolders you create yourself for 
different projects, and the Downloaded Clips subfolder (where clip art 
you downloaded from Office.com is stored). How to store a file in the 
Favorites folder or a folder you create yourself is explained later in this 
chapter in “Creating your own My Collections subfolder for the Clip 
Organizer.”
 
✦ Office Collections: Includes many subfolders, each named for a clip-art 
category. Select a subfolder to view clip art in a category. You installed 
these clip-art images when you installed Office. The clip-art images are 
located on your computer.
 
✦ Web Collections: Includes many subfolders, each named for a 
clip-art category. To see these clip-art images, your computer must be 
connected to the Internet.
Inserting a media file
After you’ve found the media file you want, either by searching in the Search 
pane or browsing among the folders in the Collection List pane, you can 
insert it by following these instructions:
 
 
✦ Clip Organizer: Open the file’s drop-down list and choose Copy. Then 
click in your file, go to the Home tab, and click the Paste button (or 
right-click and choose Paste).
 
✦ Clip Art task pane in an Office program: Either double-click the image 
or open its drop-down list and choose Insert.
Microsoft permits users of Office to get clip 
art, photos, audio files, and video clips from a 
Microsoft Web site. To see what kind of media 
Microsoft offers online, connect your computer 
to the Internet and click the Clips Online button 
(you can find it on the right side of the Standard 
toolbar in the Microsoft Clip Organizer.). You 
come to a Microsoft Web site where you can 
download collections of clip art and other 
media files to your computer.
When you find a file you like, move your pointer 
over the file and choose Add to Collection. To 
download the files to your computer, click the 
Unsaved Collection link (you can find this link 
on the upper-right corner of the window) and 
choose Download. In the Clip Organizer, you 
can find files you downloaded from Microsoft 
in the My Collections\Downloaded 
Clips subfolder.
Getting clip art from Microsoft

Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
Storing your own files in the My Collections folders
The Collection List pane in the Clip Organizer is a convenient place to go 
when you need a media file. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could go to the Clip 
Organizer when you want a file of a family photo, graphics that pertain to 
your work, or a video you’re involved with?
It so happens that you can use the Clip Organizer for your own media files, 
not just the media files that come from Office. You can arrange it so that the 
media files you need are available to you simply by selecting the Favorites 
subfolder in the Collection List pane. For that matter, you can create a 
subfolder of your own in the Collection List and keep your media files there.
Adding your own media files to the Clip Organizer
If you’re a fan of the Clip Organizer — if you think it’s a convenient place to 
store and get media files — place your own files in the Clip Organizer. This 
way, you can open the Clip Organizer and get right to work making graphics 
or videos for a project you’re working on.
Follow these steps to put your own media files in the Clip Organizer:
 
1. Click the Collection List button, if necessary, to see the Collection List.
 
2. Choose File➪Add Clips to Organizer➪On My Own.
 
 The Add Clips to Organizer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.

3. Select the file or files whose names you want to store in the Clip 
Organizer.
 
 For example, open your My Pictures folder and select the graphic 
files that you often work with. You can select more than one file by 
Ctrl+clicking.
 
4. Click the Add To button.
 
 The Import to Collection dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6. It 
lists subfolders of the My Collections folder.
 
5. Select the subfolder where you want to store your file or files and 
click OK.
 
6. Click the Add button in the Add Clips to Organizer dialog box.
 
When you add media files to the Clip Organizer, you don’t move the files to 
a new location on your computer, although it may appear that way. Truth be 
told, the folders in the Clip Organizer don’t really exist on your computer. 
The folders actually represent categories. Inside each category are shortcuts 
similar to the shortcuts on the Windows desktop that tell your computer 
where the files are located on your computer. When you place a file in the 
Clip Organizer, what you’re really doing is placing a shortcut to a file located 
somewhere on your computer or network.
Organizing media files in the My Collections subfolders
The My Collections subfolders in the Collection List pane — Favorites and 
the others — are excellent places for storing the media files you use often. 
All you have to do to get them is select the Favorites subfolder or another 
subfolder in the Collection List. Follow these steps to copy or move a media 
file to the Favorites subfolder or another subfolder in the Clip Organizer (the 
next section in this chapter explains how to make subfolders of your own):
 
1. Find the media file or files you want to store in a subfolder.
 
 Earlier in this chapter, “Locating the media file you need” explains how 
to locate a media file.
 
2. Select the file or files on the right side of the Clip Organizer window.
 
 To select more than one file, Ctrl+click the files; choose Edit➪Select All 
to select them all.
 
3. Give the Copy to Collection or Move to Collection command.
 
 You can give these commands two different ways:
 
• Open the file’s drop-down list and choose Copy to Collection or 
Move to Collection.
 
• Open the Edit menu and choose Copy to Collection or Move to 
Collection.

692
Handling Media Files with the Clip Organizer
 
 You see the Copy to Collection or Move to Collection dialog box.
 
4. Select a folder in the dialog box.
 
 If necessary, click a plus sign (+) beside a folder to display its subfolders.
 
5. Click OK.
To remove a file from a subfolder, select it and then press the Delete key, or 
open its drop-down list and then choose Delete from Clip Organizer. Deleting 
a file this way doesn’t remove it from your computer; it just takes its name 
out of the Clip Organizer.
Creating your own My Collections subfolder for the Clip Organizer
If you work with a number of media files, organize them into My Collections 
subfolders. Put photographs in a Photographs subfolder. Put audio files in a 
Music subfolder. That way, you can find media files simply by going to 
the subfolder where you placed them. Follow these steps to create a new 
subfolder in the Clip Organizer:
 
1. Click the Collection List button, if necessary, to display the Collection 
List task pane.
 
2. Choose File➪New Collection.
 
 The New Collection dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the folder in which to place your new subfolder.
 
 Selecting My Collections is probably the best choice, but place your new 
subfolder wherever you want.
 
4. Enter a name for the subfolder in the Name box.
 
5. Click OK.
If you need to rename a folder, select it in the Collection List, choose Edit➪
Rename Collection, and enter a new name. To remove it, choose Edit➪Delete.

Chapter 5: Note Taking 
with OneNote
In This Chapter
✓ Getting acquainted with OneNote
✓ Creating notebooks, sections, pages, and subpages for storing notes
✓ Writing and drawing notes
✓ Navigating in OneNote
✓ Organizing and finding stray notes
✓ Selecting, moving, and deleting notes, sections, and pages
✓ Using OneNote in conjunction with other Office programs
M
icrosoft OneNote is designed for taking notes — at meetings, 
at conferences, or when talking on the telephone. Rather than 
scribble notes indiscriminately in a Word document, you can enter them 
in OneNote and be able to retrieve them later. You can use your notes as 
building blocks for reports and white papers. You can copy them to Excel, 
PowerPoint, Word, or another Office 2010 program. OneNote comes with 
all sorts of amenities for finding and filing notes. OneNote can help you 
brainstorm and organize your ideas.
This chapter explains what OneNote is, how you can use it to write notes, 
and how to organize and find notes. Finally, it explains a couple of tricks for 
recycling notes into other Office programs.
Running OneNote
Do one of the following to run OneNote:
 
✦ Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Microsoft Office➪
Microsoft Office OneNote 2010.
 
✦ Right-click the OneNote icon in the Notification area (it’s located in the 
lower-right corner of the screen next to the clock) and choose Open 
OneNote. If you don’t see the icon in the Notification area and you want 
to see it there, go to the File tab in OneNote, choose Options on the 
drop-down list, visit the Display category in the Options dialog box, and 
select the Place OneNote Icon in the Notification area of the Taskbar 
check box.

694
Introducing OneNote
OneNote opens to the notebook, section, and page that was open the last 
time you closed the program.
 
OneNote is unusual among Office programs in that it doesn’t have a Save 
button or Save command. Every 30 seconds, OneNote saves all the notes for 
you. You needn’t concern yourself with whether notes are being saved.
Introducing OneNote
Figure 5-1 shows the OneNote screen. The purpose of OneNote is to help 
you enter notes, keep track of notes, find notes when you need them, and 
organize your notes. Read on to discover how to find your way around 
OneNote and how OneNote organizes notes into notebooks, sections, and 
pages.

Introducing OneNote
 
✦ Navigation bar: On the left side of the screen, the Navigation bar lists 
the names of notebooks you created, and within each notebook, section 
and section groups. Click the Collapse Navigation Bar or Expand 
Navigation Bar button to hide or display the Navigation bar. In the bar 
itself, you can click buttons to expand and collapse notebooks and 
section groups. Click a section name to open a section.
 
✦ Section (and section group) tabs: Section and section group names 
appear in tabs above the page. Click the name of a section to see its 
pages. (You can also click a section name in the Navigation bar.) Click 
the name of a section group to make its sections appear on the tabs.
 
✦ Page window: After you select a page in the Page pane, it appears in the 
Page window, and you can read notes you wrote on the page. The title of 
the page appears at the top of the window in the Title text box.
 
✦ Page pane: The names of pages and subpages in the section you 
selected appear on tabs in the Page pane.
Units for organizing notes
From largest to smallest, the program offers these units for organizing notes:
 
✦ Notebook: Create a notebook for each important project you’re involved 
in. OneNote places one button on the Navigation bar for each notebook 
you create. The Navigation bar is located on the left side of the window 
(see Figure 5-1).
 
✦ Sections: A section is a subcategory of a notebook; it is used to store 
pages. Each notebook can have many different sections, and each section, 
in turn, can have many pages. In Figure 5-1, there are five sections in 
the Madagascar notebook: Agriculture, Reunion, Mauritius, Vanilla, and 
History.
 
✦ Section groups: A section group is a means of organizing and quickly 
finding sections. Although sections do not have to be stored in a section 
group, you can use section groups to store sections. The names of section 
groups appear below the names of sections on the Navigation bar and to 
the right of sections in the section tabs.
 
✦ Pages and subpages: A page is for writing and storing notes. Pages are 
stored in sections. Refer to Figure 5-1 to see how the names of pages 
appear on the Page pane (on the right side of the screen) on page tabs. 
Within a page, you can also create a subpage.
 
✦ Notes: Write your notes on pages and subpages. To write a note, all you 
have to do is click a page and start typing.

696
Creating Storage Units for Notes
Creating Storage Units for Notes
Before you write your first note, give a moment’s thought to organizing 
notes in the notebook-section-pages hierarchy. Think of descriptive names 
for your notebook, sections, section groups, and pages. Then get to work 
creating the storage units you need for your notes. These pages explain how 
to do it.
Creating a notebook
OneNote creates a new notebook for you automatically the first time you 
start the program. This notebook is called Personal. Follow these steps to 
create a new notebook:
 
 1. On to the File tab, choose New.
 
 
 The New Notebook window opens. You can also right-click the 
Notebooks pane and choose New Notebook.
 
2. Choose Web, Network, or My Computer to tell OneNote where you 
intend to store the notebook you are about to create.
 
3. Enter a name for the notebook.
 
4. Select the folder in which you will store the notebook.
 
 To do so, click the Browse button and select a folder in the Select Folder 
dialog box.
 
5. Click the Create Notebook button.
 
 The new notebook opens on-screen. OneNote creates a section (called 
New Section 1) and a page (called Untitled Page) in your notebook.
 
6. Change the name of the section and page.
 
 Follow these instructions to change section and page names:
 
• Changing the section name: Right-click the section name, choose 
Rename on the shortcut menu, and enter a descriptive name. You 
can also double-click a name and enter a new one.
 
• Changing the page name: Enter a name in the Title text box at the 
top of the page provided for names. After you enter the name, the 
new name appears as well on the Page pane on the right side of 
the screen.
To delete a notebook, close OneNote, open Windows Explorer or Computer, 
go to the folder where the notebook is stored, and delete the folder. To find 
out where notebooks are stored by default on your computer, go to the 
File tab, choose Options, go to the Save & Backup category of the OneNote 
Options dialog box, and look for the Default Notebook Location.

Creating sections, section groups, and pages
Create sections, section groups, and pages to organize your notes:
 
 
✦ Creating a new section: Click the Create a New Section button (which is 
located to the right of the section tabs) or right-click the Navigation bar 
or a section tab and choose New Section. A new section tab appears. 
Enter the section name on the tab and press Enter. (After you create a 
new section, OneNote automatically creates a new page to go with it. 
This page is called “Untitled Page.” To rename this page, enter a name in 
the Title text box at the top of the page.
 
 You can color-code sections to distinguish one section from the next. 
To change a section’s color, right-click its tab, choose Section Color, 
and choose a color on the submenu. To rename a section, right-click its 
name, choose Rename, and enter a new name.
 
✦ Creating a new section group: Right-click the Navigation bar or a sec-
tion tab and choose New Section Group. A section group tab appears. 
Enter a name and press the Enter key.
 
 To move or copy a section you already created into a section group, 
right-click its name and choose Move or Copy. In the Move or Copy 
Section dialog box, select the name of a section group and click 
the Move or Copy button. You can also drag a section name in the 
Navigation bar into a section group.
 
 
✦ Creating a new page: Click the New Page button (it’s located at the top 
of the Page pane), press Ctrl+N, or right-click the Page pane and choose 
New Page. A new page appears. Enter a page name in the Title text box. 
The name you enter appears on a page tab.
 
✦ Creating a new subpage: Display the page under which you will create 
a subpage, open the drop-down list on the New Page button, and choose 
New Subpage. Then enter a name in the Title text box.
You can rearrange pages and subpages in the Page pane by dragging their 
names.
Renaming and deleting groups, 
section groups, and pages
Think the words “right-click” when you want to rename or delete a group, 
section group, or page. To rename or delete one of these items, right-click 
it and choose Rename or Delete on the shortcut menu. After you choose 
Rename, enter a new name for your group, section group, or page.

698
Writing Notes
Writing Notes
Although the program is called OneNote, you can enter three kinds of notes. 
You can enter typed notes, drawings, and screen clippings. Moreover, if 
you’re using a Tablet PC to scribble your notes, OneNote can (at least in 
theory) recognize whether you’re writing by hand or drawing. These pages 
explain how to type notes, draw notes, and take screen captures in notes.
 
Notes appear in what are called containers, as shown in Figure 5-2. Move the 
pointer over the top of a container and you see the four-headed arrow. At 
that point, you can click and drag a note elsewhere. Drag the right side of a 
note container to change its width.
 
Figure 5-2: 
A typed note 
(left) and a 
drawn note 
(right).
 
Typing a note
To type a note, simply click and start typing. Press the Enter key to begin a 
new paragraph in a note. You can draw upon the commands on the Home 
tab — do you recognize them from Microsoft Word? — to format the text or 
change its color.
 
 To get more room on a page for notes, try collapsing the Navigation bar and 
page tabs. To do so, press F11 or go to the View tab and click the Full Page 
View button.
Drawing with a pen or highlighter
Follow these steps to draw a note with a pen or highlighter:
 
 1. On the Draw tab, click the Select & Type button.
 
 2. Open the Pens gallery and choose a pen or highlighter.
 
3. Start drawing.
 
 Click the Eraser button and click a line if you need to erase something 
you wrote or drew. Choose a shape from the Insert Shape gallery if that 
improves your drawing skills.
 
4. Press Esc or click the Select & Type button again when you finish 
drawing or highlighting.

 Want proof that computers are getting smarter? Click the Select & Type 
button and write something on the page in your best handwriting. Then click 
the Ink to Text button on the Draw tab. OneNote converts your handwritten 
note to typewritten text.
Taking a screen-clipping note
In OneNote lingo, a screen clipping is a note with a screen shot inside it, as 
shown in Figure 5-3. OneNote makes it remarkably easy to take screen clippings 
like these. Go to the Web page, Word document, or other item that you need 
a picture of, and use one of these techniques to take a screen clipping:
 
 
✦ Starting in OneNote: Switch to OneNote, go to the Insert tab, and click 
the Screen Clipping button. You return to the program you were in 
previously. Drag the pointer to capture the portion of the screen you 
want for the clipping. When you finish dragging, you return to OneNote, 
and the screen clipping you took appears in a note.
Suppose you’re brainstorming and you come 
up with an idea that cries out to be preserved 
in a note. To quickly jot down your note, write 
a “side note” in the small but convenient Side 
Note window. This window works in cahoots 
with OneNote to help you record ideas before 
you forget them. When you enter a note in the 
window, it’s entered as well in OneNote in 
the Unfiled Notes folder. Next time you open 
OneNote, you can go to the Unfiled Notes 
folder, locate your note, and copy or move it to 
another folder.
To open the Side Note window, click the 
OneNote icon in the Notification area or press 
Windows key+N. Enter your note and then click 
the Close button in the Side Note window.
To find your note the next time you open 
OneNote, click the Unfiled Notes button. You 
can find this button near the bottom of the 
Navigation bar. Your note is filed away on a 
page named after the note you entered. Later 
in this chapter, “Some Housekeeping Chores” 
explains how to move notes.

Getting from Place to Place in OneNote
 
✦ Starting in the Notification tray: Right-click the OneNote icon in the 
Notification tray and choose Create Screen Clipping (or press Windows 
key+S). Then drag the pointer on your screen to capture the part of the 
screen you want for the clipping. The Select Location in OneNote dialog 
box appears. Do one of the following:
 
• Select a section in the dialog box and click the Send to Selected 
Location button. OneNote creates a new page in the section you 
chose for the clipping and places the clipping on the page.
 
• Click the Copy to Clipboard button. Back in OneNote, right-click a 
page and choose Paste to paste the clipping into OneNote.

Getting from Place to Place in OneNote
As you fill up a notebook with sections, section groups, pages, subpages, 
and notes, finding the place you need to be to enter or read a note gets more 
difficult. Here are ways to get from section to section or page to page in the 
OneNote window:
 
✦ Going to a different notebook: Click a notebook button on the 
Navigation bar. Use one of these techniques to find out where clicking a 
notebook button takes you:

Finding and Keeping Track of Notes
 
• Move the pointer over a button. You see a notebook’s name and the 
folder where it is stored in a ScreenTip box.
 
• If the Navigation bar is collapsed, click the Expand Navigation Bar 
button. Now you can see the names of notebooks as well as the 
names of notebook sections on the Navigation bar. The Expand 
Navigation Bar button is located at the top of the Navigation bar.
 
✦ Going to a different section or section group: Click the name of a 
section or section group in the Navigation bar or along the top of the 
window. Section group names are listed at the bottom of the Navigation 
bar and to the right of section names. You can expand and collapse 
section groups in the Navigation bar by clicking the plus or minus sign 
on a section group symbol.
 
✦ Go to a different page: Click a page or subpage tab on the right side of 
the window. To make more room for page and subpage names, click the 
Expand Page Tabs button. You can find it to the right of the New Page 
button.
Finding and Keeping Track of Notes
If you’re an habitual note taker, you may find yourself drowning in notes. 
You won’t be able to find the note you’re looking for. The great idea you had 
may be lost forever. To keep notes from getting lost, these pages explain 
how to find stray notes and how to organize notes so that they don’t get lost 
in the first place.
Finding a stray note
To find a lost note, you must be able to remember a word or two in the note. 
Follow these steps to chase down a lost note:
 
1. Click in the Search box.
 
 This box is located to the right of the Section tabs, above the Page pane. 
As soon as you click in the Search box, a menu opens for telling OneNote 
where you want to search.
 
2. To declare where you want to search for the note, click the Change 
Search Scope button (it’s on the right side of the Search box) and choose 
This Section, This Notebook, or another option on the drop-down list.
 
 You can also open this drop-down list by clicking the Type to Search In 
hyperlink.
 
3. Enter the word or phrase you’re looking for in the Search box.
 
4. Click the Find button.
 
 OneNote lists all notes with the text you entered.
 
5. Click a note to go to the page where it is located.

Finding and Keeping Track of Notes
Tagging notes for follow-up
The best way to keep notes from getting lost is to carefully place them in 
notebooks, sections, and pages. Short of that, you can tag notes to make it 
easier to follow up on them. OneNote offers numerous ways to tag notes. 
After you tag a note, you can search for it by opening the Tags Summary task 
pane, arranging notes according to how they were tagged, and pinpointing 
the note you want, as shown in Figure 5-4.

Arranging tagged notes in the task pane
Follow these steps to arrange notes that you tagged in the Tags Summary 
task pane:
 
 1. On the Home tab, click the Find Tags button.
 
 
 You see the Tags Summary task pane (refer to Figure 5-4).
 
2. Open the Group Tags By drop-down list and choose an option.
 
 These options determine the order in which tagged notes appear in the 
task pane. Tag Name, for example, arranges notes according to which 
icon they’re tagged with; Section arranges notes under section names; 
Note Text arranges notes in alphabetical order.
 
3. Open the Search drop-down list and choose an option.
 
 These options determine which notes appear in the task pane. This 
Section, for example, assembles only flagged notes from the section 
that appears on-screen; This Notebook gathers flagged notes from all 
sections in the notebook you’re viewing.
 
 A list of notes appears in the task pane.
 
4. Click the name of a note you want to visit.
 
 OneNote opens the page with the note whose name you clicked and 
selects the note.
 
To remove tags from notes, select the notes and press Ctrl+0 (zero), or open 
the drop-down list on the Tags gallery and choose Remove Tag.
Some Housekeeping Chores
Unless you play loud soul music while you’re doing it, housekeeping can 
be a tedious and irksome activity. Here are methods for handling a few 
housekeeping chores:
 
✦ Selecting notes: Click the bar along the top of a note to select it. 
Ctrl+click to select several notes.
 
✦ Moving notes to another page: Use the tried-and-true cut-and-paste 
method. Select the note, right-click, choose Cut, right-click the page 
where you want to move the note, and choose Paste.
 
✦ Moving a page to another section: Right-click the page’s tab and choose 
Move or Copy (or press Ctrl+Alt+M). You see the Move or Copy Pages 
dialog box. Select a section name and click the Move or Copy button.

704
OneNote and Other Office Programs
 
✦ Removing a notebook from the Navigation bar: To remove a note-
book’s name from the Navigation bar and keep the bar from getting 
too crowded, right-click the notebook’s button and choose Close This 
Notebook. To reopen a notebook, go to the File tab, choose Open, click 
the Open Notebook button, and select the notebook’s name in the Open 
Notebook dialog box.
 
✦ Deleting notes: Select the notes you want to delete and press the Delete 
key or right-click and choose Delete.
 
✦ Deleting a section: Right-click the section tab and choose Delete. 
Because each section is actually a file, you can recover a section you 
deleted accidentally by retrieving it from the Recycle Bin.
 
✦ Deleting a page or subpage: Right-click the page tab and choose Delete. 
You can’t recover a page of notes that you delete this way.
 
 OneNote maintains a Recycle Bin of its own. If you mistakenly delete a 
section or page, you can recover it by going to the Share tab and clicking 
the Notebook Recycle Bin button. Sections and pages you deleted appear 
(deleted pages appear on the Deleted Pages tab). To restore a section or 
page, right-click it, choose Move or Copy, select the section you want to 
restore in the Move or Copy dialog box, and click the Move button.
OneNote and Other Office Programs
OneNote works hand in hand with its brothers and sisters in the Office 
suite. These pages describe how to recycle material from OneNote into 
other Office programs and recycle material from other Office programs into 
OneNote.
Using data from OneNote in other Office programs
To make use of OneNote data in other Office programs, you can copy the 
data, link it to a Word or PowerPoint file, send it by e-mail, or turn it into an 
Outlook task. Better keep reading.
Copying a note into another Office program
To copy a note into another program, use the copy-and-paste command. 
Select the note, right-click, and choose Copy. Then go to the other program, 
right-click, and choose Paste. Typed notes land in the other program in the 
form of text. Drawn notes land as Portable Network Graphics (.png) files.

Chapter 6: Automating Tasks 
with Macros
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what a macro is
✓ Displaying and hiding the Developer tab
✓ Examining macro security issues
✓ Recording, running, and editing a macro
✓ Placing a macro button on the Quick Access toolbar
T
his brief chapter explains how macros can make your work a little 
easier. I describe how to display the Developer tab on the Ribbon, 
record a macro, run a macro, and edit a macro. I also look into macro 
security issues and show you how to place a macro button on the Quick 
Access toolbar.
What Is a Macro?
A macro is a set of command instructions recorded under a name. When you 
activate a macro, the program you’re working in carries out the instructions 
in the macro. Macros help automate repetitive and complex tasks. Instead 
of entering commands yourself, the macro does it for you — and it enters 
the commands faster and more efficiently. Instead of reaching into several 
dialog boxes to get a task done, you can run a macro and let it do the work.
 
Not that you necessarily need to know it, but playing a macro involves 
running command sequences in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a 
programming language built into all the major Office 2010 applications. 
Behind the scenes, the application you’re working in executes VBA code 
when you run a macro.
Displaying the Developer Tab
Before you can run a macro or do anything in the wonderful world of 
macros, you must display the Developer tab. Figure 6-1 shows the Developer 
tab in PowerPoint. Follow these steps to display or remove this tab:

710
Managing the Macro Security Problem
 
Figure 6-1: 
The 
Developer 
tab (in 
PowerPoint).
 
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Options.
 
 
 You see the Options dialog box.
 
2. Go to the Customize Ribbon category.
 
3. On the right side of the dialog box, select the Developer check box.
 
4. Click OK.
Managing the Macro Security Problem
A macro is a little (and sometimes not so little) computer program in its own 
right. As such, macros can contain computer viruses. When you run a macro 
in a PowerPoint presentation, Word document, Excel workbook, or any other 
file, you run the risk of infecting your computer with a virus.
To help protect you against macro viruses, Office gives you the opportunity 
to decide how you want to handle files that contain macros. You can disable 
all macros, disable some macros, or enable all macros. (If you’re working in 
an office on a network, the network administrator may have decided for you 
whether you can run macro files on your computer. Network administrators 
can disable all files that contain macros.)
Follow these steps to tell Office how you want to handle macros:
 
 1. On the Developer tab, click the Macro Security button.
 
 
 You see the Macro Settings category of the Trust Center dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 6-2.
 
2. Under Macro Settings, declare how you want to handle Office files 
that contain macros.
 
 Your choices are as follows:
 
• Disable All Macros without Notification: You can’t run macros, and 
moreover, you’re not alerted to the fact that your file contains 
macros or given the opportunity to enable the macros.

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Automating Tasks 
with Macros
711
Managing the Macro Security Problem
 
• Disable All Macros with Notification: When you open a file with 
macros, you see the panel shown in Figure 6-3. It tells you that 
macros have been disabled, but gives you the opportunity to enable 
the macros by clicking the Enable Content button.
 
• Disable All Macros Except Digitally Signed Macros: You can run only 
macros that have been certified with a digital signature. Developers 
can apply for digital signatures that deem their macros safe to run. 
When you open a file with digitally signed macros, a dialog box tells 
you who developed the macros and gives you the opportunity to 
decide whether you want to allow them. However, you can’t run 
macros that don’t have a digital signature.
 
• Enable All Macros: You can run all macros, no matter where they 
came from and who made them. Choosing this option is a risky 
proposition. Choose it only if you get Office files from people or
parties you know and trust.
 
3. Click OK.

security.
 
 
Figure 6-3:

Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files that contain macros have a file extension 
that ends in the letter m (the m stands for “macro”). Excel files have the 
extension .xlsm, PowerPoint files the extension .pptm, and Word files 
the extension .docm. Even if you disable macros, you can glance at a file’s 
extension letters to tell whether it includes macros.

712
Recording a Macro
Recording a Macro
Recording a macro in an Office application is a matter of turning on the 
Macro Recorder and giving commands. The Macro Recorder is modeled 
after a tape recorder. You turn on the recorder, choose commands, and 
turn the thing off. Following are ground rules and instructions for recording 
macros.
 
Unless you want to construct them on your own using VBA code, you can’t 
record your own macros in PowerPoint, Outlook, or Publisher. (You can 
record macros in Word, Excel, and Access.) To make use of macros in 
PowerPoint, Outlook, or Publisher, you have to obtain them from a devel-
oper or have them already in your files.
Enabling your files for macros
To record macros, you must make sure that the file in which you record 
them is macro enabled. Macro-enabled files have file extensions that end 
in m (the m stands for “macro”). Excel files have the extension .xlsm, 
PowerPoint files the extension .pptm, and Word files the extension .docm.
Follow these steps to macro-enable a file so that you can record and run 
macros in it:
 
 1. On the File tab, choose Save As.
 
 2. In the Save As dialog box, open the Save As Type drop-down list and 
choose the macro-enable option.
 
 For example, to macro-enable a Word document, choose Word Macro-
Enabled Document (*.docm).
 
3. Click the Save button.
Ground rules for recording macros
Before you record a macro, observe these ground rules:
 
✦ Plan ahead. If the actions you intend to record in the macro are complex, 
write them down beforehand so that you can execute the commands 
without making any mistakes.
 
✦ Set up the program the way it will be when you play back the macro. 
Before creating a macro that manipulates information in a worksheet, 
for example, open a worksheet that is typical of the kind of worksheet 
on which you’ll run the macro. Unless you prepare yourself this way, 
you may have to pause the Macro Recorder (you can do that in Word) 
as you record, or you may have to edit the macro in the Visual Basic 
Editor later.

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Automating Tasks 
with Macros
713
Recording a Macro
 
✦ Toggle commands that you can switch on and off have no place in 
macros because when the macro starts running, the Macro Recorder 
can’t tell whether the command is on or off.
 
✦ Close open files that might get in the way. For example, before creating 
a macro that copies information from one file to another, close any open 
files that might confuse the issue.
 
✦ If you intend to include a Find or a Find-and-Replace operation in a Word 
macro, open the Find dialog box in Word before you start recording the 
macro, click the More button, and then click Cancel. This way, you can 
get to all the find-and-replace options when you open the dialog box as 
part of recording the macro.
 
✦ In Excel, click the Use Relative References button on the Developer tab if 
you want to record cell references as relative, not absolute, references.
Recording the macro
Having read and followed the ground rules, follow these steps to record a 
macro in Word or Excel:
 
 1. On the Developer tab, click the Record Macro button.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, opens.
 
Figure 6-4: 
The Macro 
Recorder 
dialog box in 
Word (left) 
and Excel 
(right).
 
 
 If you can’t find the Record Macro button, chances are an administrator 
removed it to prevent you from using or recording macros. Depending 
on which version of Windows you have, administrators can remove 
all macro and VBA functionality from Office by not installing the VBA 
component, or they can install the component but prevent individuals 
from accessing macros and VBA.
 
2. In the Macro Name text box, enter a name for your macro.
 
 Macro names can be 80 characters long, must begin with a letter, and 
can include numbers and underscores. Blank spaces, symbols, and 
punctuation are not allowed in macro names.

714
Recording a Macro
 
3. If you so desire, assign a toolbar button or keyboard shortcut to the 
macro.
 
 In Word, you can click the Button or the Keyboard icon and assign a 
button or keyboard shortcut for activating the macro. Later in this 
chapter, “Running a Macro from a Button on the Quick Access Toolbar” 
explains how to put a macro on the Quick Access toolbar. Chapter 1 of 
this mini-book explains how to assign a keyboard shortcut to a Word 
macro.
 
 In Excel, you can assign a Ctrl+key combination to a macro by entering a 
key in the Ctrl+ text box.
 
4. In the Store Macro In drop-down list, decide where to store the macro 
you’re about to record.
 
 In Word, you can store macros in the document you’re working on, 
the template the document is attached to, or the Normal template (the 
global template that’s always loaded). Store a macro with a template if 
you’d like to be able to run the macro in all documents you create with 
your template.
 
 In Excel, you can store macros in the workbook you’re working on 
(choose the This Workbook menu item), a new workbook, or the 
Personal.Macro Workbook. The Personal.Macro Workbook is designed 
expressly for storing macros. It is created automatically the first 
time you choose Personal.Macro Workbook. The workbook is called 
Personal.xlsb, and it’s stored in this folder if your machine runs 
Windows 7 or Windows Vista:
C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLStart
 
 The Personal.xlsb workbook is stored in this folder if your machine 
runs Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\
XLSTART
 
5. In the Description text box, enter a concise description of what the 
macro does.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box closes.
 
7. Perform the actions you want to record in the macro.
 
 The Macro Recorder records every action you take, but it doesn’t 
record actions in real time. Take your time when recording a macro. 
Concentrate on taking the actions in the right order so that you don’t 
need to adjust the code afterward.
 
 Word offers the Pause Recording button. You can click it to suspend 
recording. Click it again to resume recording.

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Automating Tasks 
with Macros
715
Running a Macro
 
 Avoid using the mouse as you record a macro (although you can use 
it to open menus and select menu commands). The Macro Recorder 
interprets some mouse actions ambiguously. Select data by using key 
presses. (In Excel, you can select cells with the mouse because the 
Macro Recorder is able to recognize cell addresses.)
 
 When you visit a dialog box as part of recording your macro, take into 
account all the dialog box settings. For example, if you visit the Font 
dialog box and choose 12 points on the Font Size drop-down list, the 
Macro Recorder duly records the 12-point font size, but it also records 
the Times Roman font in the macro if Times Roman happens to be the 
font that is chosen in the Font dialog box. The moral: Take account of all 
the settings in a dialog box when you visit it while recording a macro.
 
 In dialog boxes with tabs, you can’t click tabs to switch from tab to tab 
and choose commands. Instead, click OK to close the dialog box, reopen 
it, click a different tab, choose a command on the tab, and close the 
dialog box again.
 
 8. Click the Stop Recording button.
 
 That’s all she wrote — your macro is recorded. I suggest you test it to 
see how well it runs.
To delete a macro, click the Macros button on the Developer or View tab, 
and in the Macros dialog box, select the macro you want to delete and then 
click the Delete button.
Running a Macro
Before you run a macro, take note of where the cursor is located. The macro 
may require the cursor to be in a certain place to run properly. Follow these 
steps to run a macro:
 
 1. On the Developer or View tab, click the Macros button (or press 
Alt+F8).
 
 
 The Macro dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, appears.
 
2. Select the macro that you want to run.
 
 Macros have cryptic names, but you can usually tell what they do by 
glancing at their descriptions.
 
 If you don’t see the macro you want, make a new selection in the Macro 
In drop-down list.
 
3. Click the Run button.

716
Editing a Macro
 
 If your macro is a long one and you need to stop it from running, press 
Ctrl+Break. (On most keyboards, the Break key is located along with the 
Pause key on the right side of the keyboard, to the right of the F12 key.)
 
Figure 6-5: 
The Macro 
dialog box.
 
Editing a Macro
Editing a macro entails opening the Visual Basic Editor and editing 
Visual Basic codes, which is not for the faint of heart. If your macro is an 
uncomplicated one, you’re better off re-recording it. This book isn’t a 
developer’s guide, so it can’t go into the details of using the Visual Basic 
Editor. However, the following pages explain the basics of reading a macro 
in the Visual Basic Editor, deleting parts of a macro, and editing the text in 
a macro.
Follow these steps to view a macro in the Visual Basic Editor:
 
 1. On the Developer tab, click the Macros button (or press Alt+F8).
 
 
 You see the Macro dialog box (refer to Figure 6-5).
 
2. Select the name of the macro that needs editing.
 
3. Click the Edit button.
 
 You see the Visual Basic window, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
4. Choose File➪Save (or press Ctrl+S) after you finish editing your macro.
Macro names appear in the Procedure box on the right side of the window. 
Those computer codes in the Code window are scary, aren’t they? You can 
find one line of code for each command in your macro. Edit computer codes 
the same way that you edit text in a Word document. For example, click 
to the left of a line to select it and then press Delete to delete a line. Or type 
in the Code window to add commands or change the text that the macro 
enters in documents.

Editing a Macro
 
Figure 6-6:

in the Visual 
Basic Editor 
window.
 
Reading a macro in the Code window
Before you can do any editing in the Visual Basic Editor, you have to know 
how to read the codes in the Code window. Observe these attributes of the 
Code window:
 
✦ Sub and End Sub line: A macro begins with the Sub line and ends with 
the End Sub line.
 
✦ Apostrophes (’) at the beginning of lines: Lines that begin with an 
apostrophe (’) are descriptive comments and aren’t part of the macro 
except insofar as they help you understand what it does. Notice, for 
example, that the description line (the one you wrote before recording 
the macro) near the top of the macro appears after an apostrophe. Enter 
blank lines and lines of commentary to make macros easier to read and 
understand.
 
✦ Text enclosed in double quotation marks (”): Text that is typed in as 
part of the macro is enclosed in double quotation marks (”). If you need 
to edit the text in your macro, edit the text inside double quotation 
marks.
 
✦ With and End With lines: Codes that pertain to choices made in a dialog 
box begin with the With line and end with the End With line.

718
Running a Macro from a Button on the Quick Access Toolbar
 
✦ All dialog box options are recorded: Even if you select only a single 
option in a dialog box, the macro records all the options in the dialog 
box. A visit to the Font dialog box, for example, adds more than 20 lines 
to a macro, one for every option in the dialog box. However, you can 
edit out lines that your macro does not require.
Editing the text that a macro enters
As I mention earlier, text that is typed during a macro procedure is enclosed 
in double quotation marks (”) in the Code window. To edit the text in a 
macro, you can edit the text between double quotation marks in the Code 
window. Edit this text as though you were editing it in Word.
Deleting parts of a macro
Delete part of a macro when you want to remove a command or command 
sequence. For that matter, you may delete parts of a macro if they are 
unnecessary. Deleting unnecessary lines makes a macro easier to read and 
run faster. As I mention in the preceding section of this chapter, a visit to a 
dialog box, such as the Font dialog box, adds many lines to a macro, most of 
which are unnecessary. Your macro requires only the lines that pertain to 
changing settings.
To delete part of a macro, delete the lines as though they were text in a 
Word document: Click or click and drag in the left margin and then press the 
Delete key.
Running a Macro from a Button 
on the Quick Access Toolbar
Any macro that you run often is a candidate for the Quick Access toolbar. As 
Chapter 1 of this mini-book explains, you can place your own buttons on the 
Quick Access toolbar and move the toolbar below the Ribbon as well. Follow 
these steps to assign a macro to a button and place the button on the Quick 
Access toolbar:
 
1. Right-click any button or tab and choose Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar on the shortcut menu.
 
 You see the Quick Access Toolbar category of the Options dialog box.
 
2. In the Choose Commands From drop-down list, choose Macros (you 
can find it near the top of the list).
 
 The cryptic names of macros in your file appear in the dialog box.

Chapter 7: Linking and Embedding 
in Compound Files
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what object linking and embedding (OLE) is
✓ Linking to foreign data in another file
✓ Embedding foreign data in a file
A
compound file is a computer file that brings together data created 
in different programs. A year-end report is a classic example of a 
compound file. Typically, a year-end report includes word-processed text, 
worksheet tables, and graphics. Thanks to object linking and embedding 
(OLE), you can create compound files. They can include data from differ-
ent sources — Excel worksheets, Word text, or Paint graphic files. What’s 
better, you can copy and continuously update material from other programs 
without leaving the Office 2010 program you’re working in.
All this magic is accomplished with something called object linking and 
embedding (OLE). This chapter explains OLE, tells you how to embed data 
from another file, and explains how to link data from another file so that 
your files are updated automatically.
By the way, OLE is pronounced the same as olé (“oh-lay”), which is the word 
that the bullfighting audience shouts when the bull passes under the matador’s 
cape. ¿Loco, verdad?
What Is OLE, Anyway?
Object linking and embedding (OLE) is a means of putting more than one 
program to work on the same file. You can think of OLE as a high-powered 
version of the standby Copy and Paste commands. As you probably know, 
the Copy and Paste commands are for copying material from one place or 
program to another. For example, with the Copy and Paste commands, you 
can copy text from an Excel worksheet into a Word document. You can 
copy columns and rows from a Word table and paste them straight into a 
PowerPoint table.

722
What Is OLE, Anyway?
Linking and embedding
Object linking takes the copy-and-paste concept a step further. When you 
copy text from a Word document to a PowerPoint slide, you can link the 
Word file and PowerPoint slide so that changes made to the Word text are 
made as well to the same text on your PowerPoint slide. In effect, linking 
means that you can run the Copy and Paste commands in the background 
without having to actually choose Copy or Paste. Linking establishes a 
connection between the two objects, in this case the text in the Word 
document and the text in the PowerPoint slide, so that the one automatically 
updates the other.
Similarly, embedding enables you to keep, or embed, foreign data from 
another program in the file you’re working on. The program you’re working in 
understands that the data is foreign. When you click the data, the program’s 
tabs and buttons disappear to be replaced by tabs and buttons belonging 
to the program designed to handle the data. For example, when you click 
an Excel worksheet embedded in a Word document, you see Excel tabs and 
buttons for handling the worksheet data. In effect, you can open a second 
program inside the first program and use the second program to create data 
without having to copy the data from the second program. The object — the 
Word document or Excel worksheet — isn’t connected to another file but is 
contained within the file.
Figure 7-1 shows an Excel worksheet embedded in a PowerPoint slide. Notice 
the Excel tabs and buttons in the window. The tabs and buttons are at the 
ready. After you finish using them, you can click outside the embedded 
object — you can click outside the Excel worksheet — and go back to using 
the PowerPoint tabs and buttons. Although the table data was made in 
Excel, it looks like a PowerPoint table. Embedding an object spares you from 
having to open a different program, construct material there, and copy it 
into the file you’re working on.
A linked object is a little bit different from an embedded object. In the linked 
relationship, the program you’re currently using shouts out to the program 
where the material was created to find out whether the material was edited 
or altered in any way. If the material was updated, you can tell Office to 
gather the updated material and incorporate it into your current file. Linking 
is an opportunity for you to keep your files up-to-date. You can fold the work 
that you or a co-worker did to the original file into your file without having 
to go outside the program you’re using, and then copying and pasting it.
Uses for linking
Linking was designed to let files dynamically share information. The object — 
the Excel worksheet or Word file, for example — remains connected to its 
source. As the source file is updated, the files to which it is linked can be 
updated, too.

Linking saves you the trouble of updating files that often change. Co-workers 
can maintain a library of source files and use them to update the files to 
which the source files are linked. Here are some examples of object linking 
coming in handy:
 
✦ Your PowerPoint presentation contains sales data, and you want the 
data to be up-to-date. You create a link to the Excel worksheet where the 
sales data is stored so that your PowerPoint slide remains up-to-date as 
sales data changes.
 
✦ A co-worker has created an Excel worksheet with demographic data that 
often changes. In your Word report, you create a link to your co-worker’s 
worksheet so that demographic data appears in your report and is 
always up-to-date.
 
✦ Your company maintains a Word file with a list of branch office 
addresses and telephone numbers, and you want this list to be available 
to employees. You link your Word file to the company’s Word file. Your 
address and telephone list document stays up-to-date as addresses and 
telephone numbers change.

724
Linking to Data in a Source File
Uses for embedding
Embedding enables you to work inside an Office program on data that the 
program isn’t equipped to handle or display. Embed an Excel worksheet in 
a Word document if you want to have a table with complex mathematical 
formulas. Embed a Word document in an Excel worksheet if you want to 
write paragraphs of explanatory text and be able to call upon Word formatting 
commands. Consider embedding an object if you want to attempt something 
that you can’t normally do in the program you’re working in.
Pitfalls of linking and embedding
Linking and embedding aren’t for everybody. Here are some OLE pitfalls:
 
✦ File size: Including embedded objects in a file makes the file grow in 
size — and I mean really grow. A large file can be unwieldy and hard to 
store. It takes longer to load on-screen. By linking, you solve the file-size 
problem because the item has to be stored only once — in its original 
location.
 
✦ Carrying charges: Links are broken if you move your file or you or 
someone else moves a file to which your file is linked. A file with links 
can’t be sent over the Internet or copied to a laptop without the links 
being broken. Linking is out of the question in the case of files that 
travel to other computers. If you link to files over a network, establish a 
scheme for storing files with your co-workers so that files aren’t moved 
inadvertently.
 
✦ Formatting embedded and linked objects: Unfortunately, linked and 
embedded objects are often hard to format. Selecting the same fonts and 
colors as the fonts and colors in your file can be difficult because you 
have to rely on the commands in the source file to do the formatting. 
The end result is that linked and embedded objects sometimes look out 
of place.
 
Before you undertake any activity regarding object linking and embedding, 
save the file you’re working on. The program with which you’re working 
needs to know precisely where OLE objects go in order to execute OLE 
commands. Therefore, your file must be completely up-to-date for OLE 
commands to work.
Linking to Data in a Source File
Link a slide, document, or worksheet to another file so that changes made to 
the other file are made automatically to your slide, document, or worksheet. 
Earlier in this chapter, “Uses for linking” explains the benefits of linking to 
another file. These pages explain how to establish the link between your files, 
how to update the link, how to break a link, and how to mend broken links.

Linking to Data in a Source File
 
Links are broken when files are renamed or moved to different folders. 
Linking files is more trouble than it’s worth if you often move or rename 
files. Very carefully create or choose folders for storing linked files so that 
you don’t have to move them.
 
Before you link one file to another, save the file you’re working on. Your 
program needs to know precisely where OLE objects go in order to execute 
OLE commands. Therefore, your file must be completely up-to-date — and 
saved — for OLE commands to work.
Establishing the link
For the purposes of linking, the original file with the data you will link to 
is the source. Follow these steps to establish a link between your file and 
the source file so that your file can be updated whenever the source file is 
changed:
 
1. Open the source file with the data that you’ll link to your file.
 
2. Select the data you need and copy it to the Windows Clipboard.
 
 You can do that by right-clicking and choosing Copy or pressing Ctrl+C.
 
3. Click in the file where you want the linked data to appear.
 
 4. Click the Save button.
 
 
 As I explain earlier, all files must be saved and up-to-date for links to be 
successfully made.
 
5. On the Home tab, establish the link between the source file and 
your file.
 
 How you do this depends on the Office program you are working in. Do 
one of the following:
 
 
• Link and use styles: Open the drop-down list on the Paste button 
and choose Link & Use Destination Styles on the drop-down list. 
You can also choose Link & Keep Source Formatting in the unlikely 
event that you want the text formatting in the source file to be 
retained in your file.
 
• Paste Special dialog box: Open the drop-down list on the Paste button 
and choose Paste Special. You see the Paste Special dialog box.
 
 If you’re pasting data between different programs as well as different 
files, the Paste Special dialog box has an As list that shows what kind 
of data is being transferred. Make sure that the correct option is 
chosen in the As list and click OK in the Paste Special dialog box.
 
 If you’re pasting data between files created in the same program, 
the Paste Special dialog box offers options for choosing whether to 
copy formats and other things. For example, to copy data between 
Excel worksheets, you can copy the formulas or values only. Choose 
options and click the Paste Link button.

726
Linking to Data in a Source File
 
 6. Save your file by clicking the Save button.
 
 
 Congratulations. The link is established.
In some Office programs, you can open the source file from inside your 
file by right-clicking the linked data and choosing Linked Object➪Open (or 
Open Link). The Linked Object command is named for the kind of data being 
linked. For example, if the link is to an Excel worksheet, the command is 
called Linked Worksheet Object.
To change the size of a linked object, click it, move the pointer over a 
selection handle, and drag. To move a linked object, move the pointer over 
the object and drag when you see a four-headed arrow. (To be able to move 
an object in Word, go to the Page Layout tab, click the Wrap Text button, 
and choose an option other than In Line with Text on the drop-down list.)
Updating a link
 
Each time you open a file with data linked to a source file, the program 
you’re working in asks whether you want to update your file from the source 
file, as shown in Figure 7-2. Click the Yes, Update, or Update Links button in 
the dialog box to get new, up-to-the-minute data from the source file.
In some Office programs, you can update a link after you open a file. To do 
so, right-click the linked data and choose Update Link on the shortcut menu.

Linking to Data in a Source File
Editing data in the source file
Suppose, while staring at the linked data in your file, you notice something 
wrong. The numbers in the table aren’t accurate. There’s a misspelling in the 
list. In some Office programs, you can open the source file and edit the data:
 
1. Right-click the linked data and choose Linked Object➪Edit (if the 
linked data is in an Office program) or Linked Object➪Open (if the 
linked data is not in an Office program).
 
 The program in which the source file was created and the source file 
itself open.
 
2. Edit the data in the source file.
 
 Changes you make are transferred immediately from the source file to 
your file.
 
3. Click the Save button in the source file to save the editorial changes 
you made there.
 
 When you return to your file, you see the changes you made.
Converting a linked object to an embedded object
As the start of this chapter explains in torturous detail, “embedded object” 
is Microsoft’s term for data in a file that you create and manipulate with a 
program other than the one you are working in. In a Word document, for 
example, you can embed Excel data in a file and be able to edit the Excel 
data without leaving Word.
Suppose that the linked data in a file would serve you better if it were 
embedded. Rather than go to the source file to edit the data, you can put the 
data in your file by embedding it. For these occasions, convert your linked 
object into an embedded object by following these steps:
  
1. Right-click the linked data and choose Linked Object➪Convert.
 
 The Convert dialog box, shown in Figure 7-3, appears.
 
2. Select the Convert To option.
 
3. If necessary, select what type of data you are dealing with in the list.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 There is a drawback to converting a linked object to an embedded 
object. The link to the source is broken, and you can no longer update 
the data from its original source.

728
Embedding Data from Other Programs
 
Figure 7-3:

Embedding Data from Other Programs
By embedding data, you can enter and edit foreign data without leaving 
the program you’re working in. An Excel worksheet, for example, can be 
embedded on a PowerPoint slide (refer to Figure 7-1) When you double-click 
the embedded object, the computer program with which it was created 
opens so that you can start editing.
Embedding foreign data
How you embed data that is foreign to the program you’re working in 
depends on whether the data has already been created. You can get a 
head start embedding data if you or someone else has already created it. 
Following are instructions for embedding an object so that you can enter the 
data on your own and embedding data that has already been created.
Creating an embedded object from scratch
Create an embedded object from scratch if the data you need hasn’t been 
created yet. Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Insert tab.
 
 If your aim is to create an Excel table, click the Table button, choose 
Excel Spreadsheet, and be done with it.
 
 2. Click the Object button.
 
 
 You see the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box, as shown on the left 
side of Figure 7-4.
 
3. Click the Create New option tab (or option button).
 
4. In the Object Type list, choose the name of the program that handles 
the kind of data you want to embed.
 
 For example, to insert a space for Word text, choose Microsoft Word 
Document.

5. Click OK.
 
 Where your program’s tabs and buttons used to be, you see different 
tabs and buttons. Use them to create and edit data.
Click outside the data when you finish working on it.
Embedding data that has already been created
If the data you want to embed has been created already in another program, 
you can embed the data in your file by following these steps:
 
1. Open the file with the data you want to embed.
 
 Open the file in the program with which it was created.
 
2. Copy the portion of the file you want to embed with the Copy command.
 
 Select the data, right-click, and choose Copy in the shortcut menu.
 
3. Return to the program where you want to embed the data.
 
4. Go to the Home tab.
 
 5. Open the drop-down list on the Paste button and choose Paste Special.
 
 
 You see the Paste Special dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
6. Select the Paste option button.
 
7. In the As list, choose an option with the word Object in its name.
 
 Which options appear in the list depends on which type of object you’re 
embedding. The options without Object in their names are for pasting 
the data in picture format.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The data lands in your file.

730
Embedding Data from Other Programs

Embedding an entire file
You can embed an entire file in the file you’re working on by following these 
steps:
 
 1. In the Insert tab, click the Object button.
 
 
 You see the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box.
 
2. Select the Create from File tab (or option button).
 
 You see the version of the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box, as shown 
on the right side of Figure 7-4 (shown previously).
 
3. Click the Browse button.
 
 The Browse dialog box opens.
 
4. Select the file you want to embed in your file and click OK (or Insert).
 
5. Click OK in the Object (or Insert Object) dialog box.
 
 That’s all there is to it.
Editing embedded data
To edit an embedded object, double-click it. Where your program’s tabs and 
buttons used to be, you see a new set of tab and buttons — ones belonging 
to the program normally used to edit the type of object you’re editing. When 
you finish editing the foreign data, click outside it.
 
To change the look of embedded data, right-click it and choose Format 
Object. Then choose formatting commands in the Format Object dialog box.
The techniques for changing the size and position of embedded objects are 
the same as the techniques for resizing and repositioning shapes, graphics, 
clip-art images, and other objects (Book I, Chapter 8 enumerates these 
techniques). To reposition an embedded object, move the pointer onto its 
perimeter and drag. To resize an embedded object, move the pointer over a 
selection handle and then drag.

T
his chapter looks into Office Web Apps, the online versions of Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Respectively, these applications are 
called Word Web App, Excel Web App, PowerPoint Web App, and OneNote 
Web App. Anyone can use these applications. You don’t have to install 
Office 2010 or pay a fee of any kind. All you need is an Internet connec-
tion and an account with Windows Live. Moreover, users of the Office Web 
Apps can collaborate online with one another to create Word documents, 
Excel worksheets, PowerPoint presentations, and OneNote notebooks. As 
long as both of you are connected to the Internet, you and a colleague can 
work together on the same file simultaneously, even if one of you is in the 
Bugunda Kingdom and the other is in Uzbekistan.
Introducing Online Applications
The notion of using online applications takes some getting used to, but like it 
or not, you’ll have to get used to it because soon the majority of applications 
will be online applications. These pages explain how online applications work 
and the advantages and disadvantages of using Office Web Apps and other 
online applications.
A new concept
Here’s a computing concept that’s in your future: In the years ahead, the 
personal computer as we know it will become obsolete and most computing 
activity will take place over the Internet. Rather than store files on the hard 
drive of your computer, you will store files on a Web server on the Internet. 
Rather than install and run programs on your computer, you will run pro-
grams that someone else installed for you on a Web server. To work on a file, 
you’ll take these steps:

732
 
1. Open your Web browser.
 
 For example, open Internet Explorer or Firefox.
 
2. Go to the Web site where your files are stored.
 
3. Submit your password to the Web site.
 
 As a security measure, you submit a password to identify yourself and 
prevent others from seeing or editing your files.
 
4. Open an online application on the Web site.
 
 Online applications look and work like the applications you use today on 
your personal computer. The difference is that online application soft-
ware is installed on and run from a server on a Web site, not from a hard 
drive on a computer.
 
5. Locate the folder where you store the file you want to work on.
 
 On the Web site, files are kept in folders. The folders look and work just 
like the folders on a personal computer.
 
6. Open the file and get to work using the commands you see in your 
browser window.
Does computing online and running online applications seem like science 
fiction? If it does, have a look at Figure 8-1. This figure shows an Excel work-
sheet called “Project01” inside a Web browser window. Notice the Ribbon 
and the familiar commands on the Home tab. What you’re looking at is the 
Excel Web App, the online version of Excel. The Office Web Apps are online 
applications that you run by way of your browser from a Web site, working 
with files that you keep on the Web site.

Advantages and disadvantages 
of online applications
Online applications are the wave of the future because the advantages of 
online applications are too good to pass up. Online applications are easier to 
install and maintain than traditional software. If you work in an office, you’ve 
had the experience of having to leave your desk while a technician installs 
new software or upgrades software on your computer. A technician doesn’t 
have to visit computers throughout an office to install or upgrade an online 
application because online applications are installed in a single location — a 
Web server. As soon as a technician installs or upgrades an online applica-
tion on the server, it becomes available to all the people who connect to the 
server to do their computing.
Online applications also make computing possible wherever you can find 
an Internet connection. You don’t have to be in your office or your home 
or even carry your laptop with you. From a hotel room or friend’s house, 
you can open a Web browser, connect to the Web site where your files are 
stored, and get to work. And because your files are kept in one place, not on 
one or more computers, you don’t have to copy files between computers or 
wonder whether you’re working on the most current file.
Storing files on a server frees you from having to back up files. Technicians 
back up files on the Web server, and if a file is corrupted and needs restor-
ing, they can restore the file. Most people are not very good about backing 
up their files. Giving this onerous task to a technician is very nice indeed.
Another advantage of online applications, at least in the case of the Office 
Web Apps, is being able to work collaboratively. Because files are stored 
online where everyone who has permission can access them, more than one 
person can work on the same file simultaneously. For example, co-workers 
in various cities can go online and make last-minute changes to a PowerPoint 
presentation without having to endure a frantic conference call or pass the 
presentation around by e-mail.
 
With so many advantages to online applications, why would anyone not use 
them? In a word, the answer is privacy. Breaking into files stored on a Web 
server on the Internet is easier than breaking into files stored on a hard 
drive behind a firewall. Keeping files on a Web server — especially a server 
owned and maintained by a company that isn’t your own — makes many 
people nervous.
Compared to Office 2010, the Office Web Apps present another disadvan-
tage. Word Web App, Excel Web App, PowerPoint Web App, and OneNote 
Web App are stripped-down versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
OneNote. The Office Web Apps don’t have nearly as many features or ameni-
ties as their Office 2010 counterparts.

Office Web Apps: The Big Picture
To use Office Web Apps, start by setting up an account with Windows Live, 
a Microsoft Web site that offers Web-based applications and services. One of 
the services is called SkyDrive. Use it to create, store, and share Office Web 
App files. Windows Live (and SkyDrive) cost nothing to use. (See “Getting 
Ready to Use the Office Web Apps,” later in this chapter.)
In SkyDrive, you can create folders for storing files online. You can also 
upload files from your computer to SkyDrive and download files from 
SkyDrive to your computer. (See “Managing SkyDrive Folders” and 
“Managing Your Files on SkyDrive.”)
To create a document, worksheet, presentation, or notebook with an Office 
Web App, either start in a SkyDrive folder and choose the New command, 
or start on the File tab in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote and choose 
Save & Send➪Save to Web. (See “Creating an Office Web App file.”)
The Office Web Apps — Word Web App, Excel Web App, PowerPoint Web 
App, and OneNote Web App — are abridged versions of their Office 2010 
namesakes. Use the commands on the Ribbon and the tabs to create and 
perfect your document, worksheet, presentation, or notebook. To make use 
of a command in an Office program that isn’t found in an Office Web App, 
click the Open In button (the rightmost button on the Ribbon). (See “Editing 
an Office Web App file, later in this chapter.”)
To see how to use SkyDrive to collaborate online with other people, estab-
lish permissions for sharing folders, and issue invitations to your co-work-
ers so that they can work alongside you in cyberspace, see “Sharing and 
Co-Authoring Files,” later in this chapter.
In this book, I describe how to run the Office 
Web Apps from a server located at Windows 
Live, a Microsoft Web site, but you can also run 
Office Web Apps without keeping your files at 
Windows Live. Using a software product called 
SharePoint 2010, you can run the Office Web 
Apps from a server on a local network. For 
example, you can run the applications from and 
store your files on a server that is owned and 
operated by the company you work for.
Keeping files on a network server close to home 
helps solve the privacy problem. Meddlers and 
spies who want to steal files have a harder time 
getting them from a server on a closed network 
than they do getting them from a Windows Live 
server on the Internet. To install a SharePoint 
2010, however, you need a fair amount of tech-
nical expertise. If SharePoint 2010 interests 
you, see SharePoint 2010 For Dummies, by 
Vanessa L. Williams.

Getting Ready to Use the Office Web Apps
To start using the Office Web Apps, complete these tasks:
 
1. Make sure you have the right Web browser.
 
 The Office Web Apps work with Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, but 
not the Chrome or Opera browser. For all occasions, I recommend using 
Firefox, and you can download and install it starting at this address:
www.mozilla.com/firefox
 
2. Install Microsoft Silverlight.
 
 Silverlight is an application that improves the delivery of media over the 
Internet. Installing Silverlight isn’t mandatory, but Microsoft recommends 
it because the Office Web Apps work better and faster when Silverlight is 
installed. To download and install Silverlight, go to this address:
www.silverlight.net
 
3. Sign up with Windows Live.
 
 Go to the address listed here to sign up. You are asked to provide your 
e-mail address and a password. If you have an account with Hotmail, the 
online e-mailing service, you can use your Hotmail address and pass-
word to sign into Windows Live. To sign up, you can create a Windows 
Live ID or use your e-mail address.
http://home.live.com
Signing In and Going to the SkyDrive Window
Sign in to Windows Live by going to the address shown here, entering your 
ID and password, and clicking the Sign In button:
http://home.live.com
The Home window at Windows Live opens, which is fine and dandy, but to 
use the Office Web Apps, you need to be on the SkyDrive window. As shown 
in Figure 8-2, you can use these techniques to get to the SkyDrive window:
 
✦ Click the More link on the Windows Live taskbar and choose SkyDrive 
on the drop-down list.
 
✦ Click SkyDrive on the Navigation bar (see Figure 8-2).
The SkyDrive window lists your folders and how much space the files in your 
folders occupy. (You can store up to 25GB of files.) To see all your folders 
rather than the ones you most recently opened, click the All Folders or View 
All link.

Managing SkyDrive Folders
The SkyDrive window at Windows Live lists your top-level folders. Click a 
folder icon in the SkyDrive window to open a folder. Starting in the SkyDrive 
window, you can create folders, rename folders, and delete folders, as the 
following pages explain.
Creating a folder
SkyDrive gives you two folders for storing files. These folders are called My 
Documents and Public. (The Favorites folders are for storing shortcuts to 
Web sites.) Follow these steps to create a folder of your own:
 
1. In the SkyDrive window, click the Create Folder link.
 
 The Create a Folder window opens. If you want to create a subfolder (a 
folder inside another folder), open the parent folder before completing 
Step 1.
 
2, In the Name box, enter a descriptive name for the folder.

3. On the Share With drop-down list, choose an option to make the 
folder public or private; then click the Next button.
 
 The Share With options matter if you intend to share the files in your 
new folder with other people. For now, choose Just Me to create a pri-
vate folder or Everyone to create a public folder. You can change Share 
With settings after you create a folder, as “Choosing Share With permis-
sions” explains later in this chapter.
 
 The Add Files window appears.
 
4. For each file that you want to upload from your computer to your new 
folder, click a Browse button, choose a file in the File Upload dialog 
box, and click the Open button.
 
5. Click the Upload button in the Add Files window.
 
 Later in this chapter, “Uploading files to SkyDrive” explains how to add 
files to a folder you already created.
Going from folder to folder
The SkyDrive window shows, in big bold letters, the name of the folder you 
are currently viewing. Use these techniques go to from folder to folder:
 
✦ Click a folder icon: Clicking a folder icon opens the folder so that you 
can see its files and subfolders. 
 
✦ Use the Navigation bar: The Navigation bar —located below the folder 
name — lists the path to the folder you’re currently viewing. To back-
track, click SkyDrive or the name of a folder on the Navigation bar. For 
example, click SkyDrive to return to the SkyDrive window.
 
✦ Click the Back or Forward button: Click the Back or Forward button in 
your browser to return to a folder you previously visited.
 
When you’re in a folder window, you can click the View link and choose 
Icons, Details, or Thumbnails on the drop-down list to get a better look at 
the files in that folder. In Details view, you can see when a file was last edited 
and its size. Click the Sort By link and choose an option on the drop-down 
list to arrange files by name, date, size, or type.
Renaming and deleting folders
To rename or delete a folder, start by opening it. Then use these techniques:
 
✦ Renaming a folder: Click the More link and choose Rename on the drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 8-3. Then enter a name in the New Name 
text box and click the Save button.
 
✦ Deleting a folder: Click the More link and choose Delete on the drop-
down list. Then click OK in the message box to delete the folder and all 
its contents.

You can’t rename or delete a folder if you don’t have permission to do so. 
For more information, see “Choosing Share With permissions,” later in this 
chapter.

Creating and Editing Office Web App Files
To create a file with Word Web App, Excel Web App, PowerPoint Web App, 
or OneNote Web App, start by opening the folder where you want to keep 
the file. These pages explain how to create Office Web App files as well as 
how to open them, edit them, and find your way around the File window.
Creating an Office Web App file
I’m happy to report that creating an Office Web App file is quite easy. After 
signing in to Windows Live and going to the SkyDrive window, follow these 
steps to create an Office Web App file:
 
1. Open the folder where you will keep the file.
 
 See “Creating a folder,” earlier in this chapter, if you need to create the 
folder or subfolder first.
 
2. Click the New link and choose an option on the drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 The Word Web App, Excel Web App, PowerPoint Web App, or OneNote 
Web App opens so that you can create your worksheet, presentation, 
document, or notebook.

Opening Web App files
To open a Web App file, start by opening the folder where it is stored and 
then click its icon. The file doesn’t open right away. Instead, the File window 
opens, as shown in Figure 8-5. The File window tells you everything you need 
to know about a file. (The next section describes the File window in detail.) 
Use these techniques to open a file from the File window:
 
✦ Click the View link on the taskbar: Clicking View opens the file in a 
window so that you can view the file (but not edit it). If the file is being 
shared and the file’s owner has given you permission to edit the file in 
an Office Web App, you can edit the file. Click the Edit in Browser button 
after the file opens to edit the file in an Office Web App. (For more infor-
mation, see “Editing an Office Web App file,” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Click the Edit link on the taskbar: Clicking Edit opens the file in an 
Office Web App so that you can edit it. If the Edit link isn’t available, the 
file’s owner has not given you permission to edit the file. (See “Choosing 
Share With permissions,” later in this chapter). 
 
✦ Click the file’s icon: Clicking a file icon opens the file so you can view it. 
Clicking an icon gets the same results as clicking the View link.
 
Want to close an Office Web App file? Don’t bother looking for a Close com-
mand, because you won’t find one. To close a file, go to a different folder or 
close your browser. Files are saved automatically when you close them.
All about the File window
The File window (refer to Figure 8-5) gives you many ways to see what a file 
is all about before you view or edit it. Take heed of the activities you can do 
in the File window:
 
✦ View or edit the file: On the taskbar, click View to open and examine 
the file; click Edit to open the file in an Office Web App and be able to 
edit the file as well as examine it.

✦ Do other file-related tasks: Besides viewing and editing, visit the taskbar 
to download, delete, move, copy, rename, or share a file.
 
✦ Read and enter a description and comments: Especially if you intend 
to share the file with others, enter a description of the file so that others 
know what it is. Also, you can enter and read comments that explain 
what you or other users did to the file.
 
✦ Examine a different file in the folder: Click the Scroll Back or Scroll 
Forward arrow in the upper-right corner of the window to see the names 
of other files in the folder. Click a file’s icon to go to its file window.
 
✦ Get file information: Glance at the right side of the File window to see 
who created the file, whether it is shared, and other information.
 
✦ Copy the file’s Web address: One way to share a file is to copy its Web 
address and send it to other people. Under Information, you can copy 
the file’s address from the Web Address box. For more information, see 
“Inviting others to a SkyDrive folder,” later in this chapter.

✦ Copy code for embedding: You can also share a file by embedding code 
on a Web page such that others can click the hyperlink in the code and 
go to the file on SkyDrive. See “Inviting others to a SkyDrive folder,” later 
in this chapter.
Editing an Office Web App file
The Office Web Apps are abridged versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
OneNote. In the Office Web Apps, use the same techniques you use to edit a 
Word 2010 document (see Book II), an Excel 2010 worksheet (see Book V), a 
PowerPoint 2010 presentation (see Book VI), and a OneNote 2010 notebook 
(see Chapter 5 of this mini-book).
As well as edit an Office Web App file online, you can download it to your 
computer and edit it there. Both techniques are described forthwith.
 
You will not find a Save button in an Office Web App. The Save button is 
missing because changes you make to an Office Web App file are saved 
automatically. You don’t have to bother clicking the Save button to preserve 
your work.
Editing in an Office Web App
To edit an Office Web App file in an Office Web App, click the Edit link in the 
File window (refer to Figure 8-5). The file opens in an Office Web App. If the 
Edit link isn’t available, the file’s owner has not given you permission to edit 
the file. See “Choosing Share With permissions,” later in this chapter.
If you see the “This file cannot be edited” message, the file was created in an 
Office 2010 program, and you must save a copy of the file in order to edit it 
in an Office Web App. See the “Editing files created in Office 2010” sidebar.
Editing in an Office 2010 program
Yes, editing an Office Web App in an Office 2010 can be done. If you get frus-
trated editing an Office Web App file and you want to take advantage of the 
numerous commands in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote, you can edit 
your file in an Office 2010 program by downloading the file and editing it offline. 
Follow these steps to edit an Office Web App File in an Office 2010 program:
 
1. Open the Office Web App file (if it isn’t already open).
 
2. Click the Open In button (in PowerPoint, for example, the button is 
called Open in PowerPoint).
 
 This button is located next to the File tab if you’re viewing a file; it is 
located on the right side of the Ribbon if you’re editing a file. When you 
click the button, the Open Document dialog box appears.
Creating and Editing Office Web App Files

742
 
3. Click OK to affirm that opening the file is okay.
 
 An Office 2010 program — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote — 
opens on your computer and the Connecting To dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter your Windows Live ID and password; then click OK.
 
 The file is downloaded and opened on your computer. Depending on your 
Windows settings, you may have to click the Enable Editing button to 
start editing. Be sure to save the file on your computer after you edit it.
As “Uploading files to SkyDrive” explains later 
in this chapter, you can upload Office 2010 files 
from your computer, store them on SkyDrive, 
and open them with an Office Web App. You 
can open them, but whether you can edit them 
is another matter.
As anybody who has spent more than five min-
utes with an Office Web App knows, the Office 
Web Apps don’t offer as many features and 
doo-dads as their Office 2010 brethren. When 
it comes to editing files in an Office Web App 
that originated in Office 2010, you’re out of luck if 
the original file contains features that the Office 
Web App doesn’t support. For example, you can’t 
enter comments in Excel Web App. If you upload 
and try to edit an Excel 2010 file that includes 
comments, the Excel Web App tells you that it 
can’t be done unless you save a copy of the file.
Follow these steps to save a copy of an Office 
2010 file so that you can edit it in an Office 
Web App:
 1.  In the File window, click View on the 
taskbar.
 
 The file opens, and if any features in the 
Office 2010 file are not supported, a “this 
file may not display as intended” message 
appears, as shown in the figure that fol-
lows these steps.
 2. On the File tab, choose Save a Copy.
 
 A dialog box tells you which features in 
the Office 2010 file aren’t supported by the 
Office Web App.
 3. Click Yes in the dialog box.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 4. Enter a new name for the file or select the 
Overwrite Existing Files check box.
 
 Enter a new name of you want to keep the 
original Office 2010 file on hand; select the 
check box to delete the original file.
 5. Click the Save button.
 
 Your Office Web App creates a stripped-
down version of the Office 2010 file minus 
the features in the original file that are not 
supported.

Managing Your Files on SkyDrive
SkyDrive is first and foremost a means of organizing and managing files. You 
can take advantage of commands in a SkyDrive folder window to upload files 
to SkyDrive, download files from SkyDrive, and delete, rename, move, and 
copy files.
Uploading files to SkyDrive
To upload files from your computer to a folder you keep on SkyDrive, you 
can start in SkyDrive or in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote:
 
✦ Starting in SkyDrive: Open the folder where you want to store the files 
and click the Add Files link. The Add Files window appears. Click a Browse 
button for each file you want to upload, choose a file in the File Upload 
dialog box, and click the Open button. Then Click the Upload button.
 
✦ Starting in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote: With the file you want to 
upload to SkyDrive open, follow these steps to upload the file to SkyDrive:
 
1. On the File tab, choose Save & Send, and choose Save to Web. Save 
to Windows Live options appear.
 
2. Click the Sign In button, enter your Windows Live ID and password, 
and click OK. A list of folders you keep on Windows Live appears.
 
3. Select a folder and click the Save As button.
Later in this chapter, “Downloading files from SkyDrive to your computer” 
explains how to do move files in the other direction — from SkyDrive to your 
computer.
Moving, copying, renaming, and deleting files
Starting in a File window (refer to Figure 8-5), use these techniques to move, 
copy, rename, or delete a file:
 
✦ Moving and copying: Click the Move link or click the More link and choose 
Copy on the drop-down list. You see a window that lists your SkyDrive fold-
ers. Select a folder name and choose the Move or Copy command.
 
✦ Renaming: Click the More link and choose Rename on the drop-down list. 
Then enter a name in the New Name text box and click the Save button.
 
✦ Deleting: Click the Delete link and then click OK in the confirmation 
dialog box.
Managing Your Files on SkyDrive

744
Downloading files from SkyDrive to your computer
SkyDrive gives you the choice of downloading files one at a time or down-
loading all the files in a folder in a zip file:
 
✦ Downloading a file: In the File window (refer to Figure 8-5), click the 
Download link. You see the standard dialog box for downloading files from 
the Internet. Choose to open or save the file after you download it and 
click OK.
 
✦ Downloading all the files in a folder: In a Folder window (refer to Figure 
8-3), click the More link and choose Download as .Zip File on the drop-
down list. In the standard dialog box for downloading files, choose to 
open or save the file after you download it and click OK.
Sharing and Co-Authoring Files
As I mention at the start of this chapter, one of the great advantages of Office 
Web Apps is being able to share files with others. Microsoft uses the term 
co-authoring to describe what happens when more than one person works 
on a file in an Office Web App. As long as all parties have Windows Live 
accounts and all have permission to edit a file, they can edit it. These pages 
explain how to handle editing permissions, how to invite others to co-author 
a file, and what being invited to co-author a file entails.
Choosing Share With permissions
Whether others can open a folder on your SkyDrive page and view its files 
depends on which permissions the folder has been granted. Likewise, per-
missions determine whether others can add files to a folder, edit files, and 
delete files.
Types of permissions
If you intend to share files with others on Windows Live, you need to know how 
folder permissions work. Folder permissions fall into two broad categories:
 
 
✦ Private folders: Only the owner can open a private folder, view its files, 
add files, edit files, and delete files. The default My Documents folder is 
a private folder.
 
✦ Public folders: Everyone whom the owner invites to visit a public folder 
can visit it. The default Public folder that SkyDrive creates for you is an 
example of this type of folder. When others come to a public folder, they 
can do these tasks, depending (again) on which permissions the owner 
has given them:
 
 
• Public folder for viewing files only: Visitors can open and view the files 
in the folder (but not edit or delete the files).
Sharing and Co-Authoring Files

Book VIII
Chapter 8
Office Web Apps
745
 
 
• Public folder for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting files: Visitors 
can view the files in the folder as well as add files to the folder, edit 
files, and delete files.
Editing a folder’s permissions
When you create a new folder, SkyDrive asks you to choose an option on the 
Share With drop-down list to establish its permissions. At any time, how-
ever, you can follow these steps to establish folder permissions:
 
1. In the Folder window (refer to Figure 8-3), click the More button and 
choose Edit Permissions on the drop-down list.
 
 You see the Edit Permissions window.
 
2. Establish folder permissions.
 
 Choose whether to make the folder private or public, and if the folder is 
public, what visitors can do in the folder:
 
• Private folder: If the Edit Permissions folder says, “You’re not shar-
ing this folder,” it is a private folder already. Click the Clear These 
Settings link to make the folder private if it is a public folder.
 
• Public folder for viewing files only: Select the Everyone (Public) 
check box.
 
• Public folder for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting files: For each 
person who will co-author files in the folder, enter an e-mail address 
and press Enter. Then, on the drop-down list beside the person’s 
name, choose Can Add, Edit Details, and Delete Files.
 
3. Click the Save button.
 
 If you entered e-mail addresses, SkyDrive asks whether to send e-mail 
notifications. The next topic in this chapter explains how to notify 
people that they can visit a public SkyDrive folder.
Inviting others to a SkyDrive folder
Starting in the Folder window (refer to Figure 8-3), you can invite others to 
visit a public SkyDrive folder by clicking the More button and choosing Send 
a Link. Then, in the Send a Link window, enter an e-mail address, a word or 
two, and click the Send button.
If the folder whose contents you want to share is a public folder for viewing 
files only, you can paste HTML code on a Web page or blog so that anyone 
can click a hyperlink and go to your folder on SkyDrive. To obtain the HTML 
code, click the More button and choose Share. Then copy the code from the 
Share in a Blog or Other Webpage window.
Sharing and Co-Authoring Files

746
Visiting a SkyDrive folder by invitation
Invitations to visit a SkyDrive folder arrive in the form of an e-mail message. 
In the message, recipients can click the View Folder button to go to the 
Folder window on SkyDrive where the folder is located. From there, depend-
ing on the permission that they were given, they can view files or both view 
and edit files. Visitors can also create new Office Web App files by clicking 
the New link in the Folder window.
 
If you share files with others, be sure to write comments in the File window 
describing what you did to the file you’re sharing (see “All about the File 
window,” earlier in this chapter). Comments help the people who work on a 
file understand when, where, and how changes were made.
