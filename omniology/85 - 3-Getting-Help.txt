 
The "man" command  
 
o 
The "man" command man gives you access to an on-line manual which potentially contains a 
complete description of every command available on the system. In practice, the manual 
usually contains a subset of all commands.  
o 
man can also provide you with one line descriptions of commands which match a specified 
keyword  
o 
The online manual is divided into sections:  
 
     Section  Description 
     -------  ----------- 
        1     User Commands 
        2     System Commands 
        3     Subroutines 
        4     Devices 
        5     File Formats 
        6     Games 
        7     Miscellaneous 
        8     System Administration 
        l     Local Commands 
        n     New Commands

Examples of using the man command:  
 
 
To display the manual page for the cp (copy files) command:  
 
 
 man cp 
 
--More--23% at the bottom left of the screen means that only 23% of the man page is 
 
displayed. Press the space bar to display more of it or type q to quit.  
 
 
By default, the man page in section 1 is displayed if multiple sections exist. You can  
access a 
different section by specifying the section. For example:  
 
 
man 8 telnetd
